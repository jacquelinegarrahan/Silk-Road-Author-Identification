				To transfer funds into my Mt.Gox account.<br />It states &#039;&#039; Funds deposited with Mt.Gox must come from the bank account with the name that matches the owner of the Mt.Gox account. &#039;&#039;<br />Yet it hasn&#039;t asked me my name yet. All i&#039;m sat here with is a username &amp; password!<br /><br />Also is it safer to do a bank transfer or bank deposit?<br /><br />Replies really appreciated, i desperately want to start buying goodies on sr. Bitcoins are the bane of my life atm

				If you are using a third party such as bitinstant to fund your mt gox account, you won&#039;t need to submit anything unless you&#039;re depositing thousands of dollars (or fucked up and used tor to access the account). The account verification thing is usually a problem for users who wish to withdraw lots of btc from mt gox:<br /><br />&quot;All [withdrawal methods such as sending btc] are subject to a withdrawal limit of 1000 USD per 24hr period and 10000 USD per 30 Day period&quot;<br /><br />So basically, if you buy a shitload of btc on mt gox, you&#039;ll need to verify your account before sending them onto SR or other sources. Otherwise, there shouldn&#039;t be any problems with verification.

				Thanks for clearing that up.<br />My plan is to transfer my bitcoins from MtGox to &#039;instawallet&#039; -&gt; Then from instawallet transfer them into silkroad. <br /><br />I already know MtGox can see the wallet i&#039;m putting the bitcoins into, but, can instawallet +/or Mtgox see where i&#039;m spending my bitcoins? <br /><br />Is there anyway to link my account or activity on SR back to my wallet? <br /><br />Finally if instawallet can indeed see where im spending my coins; do they even care? will they take action?<br /><br />Cheers for the ongoing assistance can&#039;t wait to get buying!<br /><br /><br />

				You don&#039;t need to get verified to use MTGOX although I believe they clear your funds quicker if you do.<br />Althought you can&#039;t access MTGOX with Tor, you can instawallets. You can also use a Tor bitcoin mixer like bitcoin fog. This takes bitcoins from you and sends someone else&#039;s back to you in&nbsp; random increments. This effectively breaks the link between the coins you bought and the ones you send to your SR account

				I&#039;m facing the same dilemma. Unfortunately the only way I can purchase bitcoins is through a bank transfer, and as stated by Rizmatter, both account names must match. Should I be worried about this whole verification process?

So if I KNEW your mt gox address I could follow your coins to the instawallet address and then to the SR address.
