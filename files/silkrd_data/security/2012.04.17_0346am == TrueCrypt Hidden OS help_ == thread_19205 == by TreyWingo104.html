				<br />Cant seem to figure this out....Plan to use&nbsp; Liberte/Tails and would like to have my entire system TC&#039;d first. I&#039;ll throw you a BTC for a&nbsp; thorough walk through, 5 bucks&nbsp; if you can help explain all the steps to create encrypted hidden OS with the inner and outer &quot;decoy&quot;<br />system.&nbsp; When I select that method in the TC menu it gives an Error message that&nbsp; says: <br /><br />&quot;The currently running OS is not installed on the boot partition (The first Active Partition)...<br /><br /><br /><br />I tried making a new partition... set as the L partition separate from my C drive but I now realize this has nothing to do with it....<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s the info/drive info currently on the computer...Vista SP2 dual core 2800 intel<br /><br />The C drive has 2 parts I think....<br /><br /><br />1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System Volume...system, primary<br /><br />2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Main Partition&nbsp; 500 or so GB about&nbsp; (boot)...primary<br /><br />ALSO now the L:/ partition I made, like 50GB...can be set to either logical or primary, should be easy to change if not needed.<br /><br /><br />It also shows a second disk, 2 parts...<br /><br /><br />1b)&nbsp; 800MB partition named NVCACHE...Perhaps N Vidia Cache for graphics?....&nbsp; primary partition&nbsp; , no status<br /><br />2b)&nbsp; 4.00 MB unallocated partition...Logical partition, no status<br /><br /><br />Thanks SR, cant wait to get this set up right.<br />

I would say that this is unnecessary though because you can always use a TC partition to store your Tor browser/PGP Software/Bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />Creating a Truecrypt container with a hidden partition is very simple and once again there&#039;s a very simple tutorial for this on the Truecrypt website:<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-operating-system<br /><br />Frankly I think the second of the two is much easier to set up and can be just as secure - in fact I keep all my SR related software and information in a 1GB container in my (encrypted) home directory. The advantage of course is that if LEO tries to force you to reveal the password you can make sure to give them the &quot;safe&quot; one which will reveal harmless dummy data.<br /><br />With regard to the Ironkey, these are an excellent form of security but I am not sure these can be formatted to hold an OS as you would need to be able to boot from the USB drive in order to use it and as far as I can tell you can only decrypt the drive from within your own OS.<br /><br />What you may want to do is put a Truecrypt container on the drive and as I said install your standalone applications inside it, so that they can only be accessed by the Ironkey. Feel free to create a container using AES/Twofish/Serpent as you say and of course your password to access the container should be different to the one you use to access the Ironkey.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
