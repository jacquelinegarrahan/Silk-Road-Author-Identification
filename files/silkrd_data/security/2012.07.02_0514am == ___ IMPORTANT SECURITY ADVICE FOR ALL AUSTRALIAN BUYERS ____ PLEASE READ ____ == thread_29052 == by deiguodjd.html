				********************************************* THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SECURITY ADVICE FOR ALL AUSTRALIAN BUYERS *********************************************<br /><br />Hey all you buyers in the great land down under i thought i would give you some security advice that would hopefully make it easier for all of us wanting to buy form overseas vendors as im sure im not the only buyer that has had something intercepted from customs so here it is <br />***PLEASE***<br />When you make a purchase do not leave in the feedback from the vendor that you purchased off that it took how ever many days to make it to Australia or Down Under or anything that would tip off customs that you have successfully received a package from a vendor no matter what country they are from as it only helps them in work out what country to scan letters and packages from as im sure that they will be looking at Silk Road vendor feedback to see if there is any comments that Australians have received a product. I&#039;m also sure that the vendors will appreciate it as well as they will not have as many reships or refunds given out.<br />I hope that by you reading this you are now that little bit more stealth like when making a purchase.<br /><br />May all you future purchases arrive safe to you and please inform any other buyers that you know of about this so that we can help out us buyers in Australia and the Vendors that we buy off and hopefully have a 100% success rate.<br /><br /><br />CHEERS ALL :D

				Good and obvious advice. This has been said again and again in pretty much every thread about Australian orders, but unfortunately people chose not to listen and continue to post shipping times and even package descriptions.

				Hello my friend,<br />Thank you for the heads up , as long as we stick to the SR rules and a little bit of common sense we can beat these people who enforce their law upon the masses . <br />Have a nice day .<br />Kind regards <br />RP
