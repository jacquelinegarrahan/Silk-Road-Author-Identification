				if you are unsure just dont follow that link. go to the actual tor page yourself by searching. pretty sure its torproject.org or you could use cnet since they have a secure download i think. im no security expert so am hesitant to give you possibly the wrong info - but if they updated tor you need to make sure you update it as well for maximum safety

				Yes that is correct. Also to update the TOR browser bundle you do not have to use TOR, you can use the clearnet just like you did when you&nbsp; downloaded TOR in the first&nbsp; place, and it is usually a lot faster, go to: https://torproject.org<br />

				Check the browser address bar. <br /><br />https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en-US&amp;small=1&amp;uptodate=1<br /><br />If this is the address, then yes, that&#039;s correct. If you still feel unsure go to the torproject site and DL it from there.

				I did all that, downloaded the latest version, opened it and clicked install. It asked if i wanted to overwrite the old version and i clicked ok and it did. But it still says i have the old version. I&#039;ve done all this 3 times and it still says the old version.

				sunny<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it still says that to me sometimes and others it wont. It just depends but as long as your not getting the little box that says out of date. If your page just shows new ip and says needs security updates. You got them! trust me if you downloaded from<br />www.torproject.org the tor bundle.<br />your fine. just wait use it a few times and it will just say thank you here is your new ip<br />...<br />so no worries bro if you used the right site
