				So, I&#039;m not an IRC noob, really, just out of practice.&nbsp; About 20 years ago, in my teens, I was on mIRC all the time, and then, in the military, we used mIRC to communicate securely over the SIPRnet.&nbsp; But, it&#039;s been awhile since I&#039;ve done much with chat of any kind.<br /><br />So, I was on the forums, and saw where SR peeps were chatting on IRC.&nbsp; So, I thought, okay, there must be a way to do this over Tor.&nbsp; So, I downloaded a cracked copy of mIRC (because $20???&nbsp; Holy shit, that used to be freeware!&nbsp; And, why do they want my home address??), fired up proxify, and logged into a server.&nbsp; And, then, I was promptly disconnected because Tor exit nodes are not allowed.&nbsp; I got that same nastygram from like, 50 servers before I quit.<br /><br />Now, I could use a clean Socks5 exit node, but those things cost coin, and I only like to use those for one reason (if you know, don&#039;t say).&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I thought I&#039;d check in with the forums to see how they&#039;re solving this problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />sleepy<br />TorChat: qsy3fzzvw6ug6wbi

				IRC is as as secure as the client you use pretty much. I would use Pidgin with OTR, although Pidgin is not the most secure choice it is the most user friendly imo. Most IRC servers ban Tor exit nodes, you will need to find some that don&#039;t I suppose. I am on a few that don&#039;t but I think they are few and far between :(.

				mIRC supposedly will leak your TOR DNS requests so don&#039;t use it (your ISP might see queries for the silkroad url).<br /><br />And if you are trying to connect to efnet via TOR then you will keep getting booted.<br />The silk road server is silcroadg3c3mtu6.onion/6667<br /><br />Most people on windows use XChat2.<br />(CLEARNET DOWNLOAD LINK http://www.silverex.org/download/)<br />
