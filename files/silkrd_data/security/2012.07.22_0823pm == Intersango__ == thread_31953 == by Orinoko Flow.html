				i dont use intersango anymore due to the fact i cannot make cash deposits via metro bank anymore and thus cannot remain anonymous,if youre ok not remaining anonymous ie wire transfer from personal account to intersango they then have your personal details and then trade Â£ for btc i wouldnt worry about the fact your using tor,when i used intersango i linked to it through tor and had no issues,check there site and have a good look around

				That is a question you need to answer for yourself. In certain jurisdictions, getting caught with a small amount of weed will not have serious repercussions. If you are not concerned with getting caught, I guess you could leave out certain security procedures. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it, but I&#039;m a privacy geek.<br /><br />I would not access Intersango using TOR. You probably used a bank transfer to get money to Intersango. That means your account can already be linked to your identity. If you use TOR to access it, it might indeed raise eyebrows. Just buy the coins, send them to another wallet, optionally you can launder them through a mixing service, and then send the coins to Silk Road.<br /><br />However if you got your money to an Intersango account in an anonymous way, then I do recommend you use TOR to access your account. That way the BTC cannot be traced back to you, and you can just send them to your Silk Road account directly.
