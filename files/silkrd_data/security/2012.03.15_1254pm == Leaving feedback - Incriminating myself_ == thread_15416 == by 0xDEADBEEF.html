				Hi,<br /><br />I was just wondering: If I put &quot;Fast shipping, great product&quot; into the feedback form, I&#039;m basically saying:&quot;I got some drugs delivered to my house and I consumed them&quot;, right?<br /><br />Now I know that the feedback page of a seller does not list the account names of the buyers. My questions are:<br /><br />Is the info that that the feedback comes from my account somewhere in SR&#039;s database?<br />Can the seller see it?<br />Can I still see it on my Orders page? (I have not left any feedback anywhere until now, but I was going to, hence my questions)<br />Is that info deleted eventually?<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if these questions have been asked already...searching for &quot;Feedback&quot; returns too much to browse through right now...

				Really, you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; PM me with more details if you want to know the rationale behind it.&nbsp; That is, if you&#039;re in the US.

				Yes, you&#039;re confessing to the person who sold you drugs that you bought and took them. Something tells me the vendors kind of suspect we&#039;re gonna do that. *)<br /><br />Protocol is for vendors to destroy all your address information as soon as they ship your product, so there won&#039;t be any way to link your feedback here to your real-life identity. Don&#039;t worry. ;)

IMO if its to the point they are tying evidence like that together get a lawyer and pray they aren&#039;t hell bent on arresting you. Just be smart and don&#039;t put a sign above your head saying &#039;I buy Drugs From SR&#039;.

If they can prove that you bought illegal substances, it doesn&#039;t really matter what you did with them. Especially if you bought them from overseas. Just that already configures international drug trafficking, so for all the DEA care you could have used them to fertilize your carrot crops and they&#039;ll still try to put you in jail forever.
