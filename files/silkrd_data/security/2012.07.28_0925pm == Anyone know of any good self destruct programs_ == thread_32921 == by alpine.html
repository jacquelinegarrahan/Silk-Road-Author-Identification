				Use full disk encryption. <br /><br />You probably wont be using termite rigged to your hard drive, so this is what I think is the best suggestion.

				Thanks, I just remember hearing in the news that the crazy guy who shot up that movie theater might of had stuff on his computer that would delete files if police tried to get in and thought of the idea.

				The problem with &#039;self destruct&#039; programs are two-fold. Either they are triggered by some sequence of keystrokes, or they are triggered by a failure to notify the application that everything is cool.<br /><br />In the first instance, if you are not sitting at your computer at the time you get knicked, then you will not be able to enter the self-destruct code. And if everything works out that you are sitting at your computer at the exact time LE busts down your door, a sharp officer is going to pull the power, so there is no guarantee that any incriminating evidence will be wiped in time.<br /><br />In the case that your particular self-destruct app requires periodic input to reassure it that everything is cool, there is always the chance that you fuck up and forget to reset the state. For example, you go on vacation, get detained, get wicky-whacked and forget, etc. It becomes way too easy to accidentally wipe out whatever it is you want wiped. And again, if the power is pulled, it is easy enough to recover the contents of your drive.<br /><br />Those that engage in illegal computer activities take care to secure their systems so that even if LE seizes their hardware, they won&#039;t be able to pull anything from it.
