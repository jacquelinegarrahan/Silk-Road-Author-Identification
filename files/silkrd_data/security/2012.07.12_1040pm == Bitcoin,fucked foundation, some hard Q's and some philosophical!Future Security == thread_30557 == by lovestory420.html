				Wondering if anyone else is quitting SR because they are reluctant to turn in their ID to dwolla or other bitcoin places? Am I only one? I also was wondering if you guys think this will continue getting away with forever, as it does not seeem possible to me, I mean seriously. Eventually won&#039;t someone figure out all of the sellers and then track any of there buyers who made mass purchase for resale purposes? I feel like this is a magical road that will end in a tragic way.. Anyone else?<br /><br />If there&#039;s a way to do SR without dwolla<br />please let me know I have no clue how else to do it. details are appreciated as well as any information you can give me in a summary of how to be secure and have privacy if continued to use SR which depends on if there is anyway around the Dwolla and Mtgox requiring your full ID to use account.. which I will not do.<br /><br />So 1. Bitcoins I want them- I don&#039;t want my ID on the internet especially not with a bitcoin place<br />2. Is SR destined to ruin all of our lives eventually and catch up with us &quot;clever folk&quot;?<br />3. Security!!! How do I get private and not retrievable internet use on torbrowser on a Dell Inspiron 1420<br /><br />basically i feel like i am going to get nailed by the cock of the law eventually, but i dont know when its gunna be. other thoughts on that?<br />

				Try buying bitcoins from a trusted vendor on SR. You can do this with moneypaks or making a deposit at a local bank, neither of these require ID.<br /><br />
