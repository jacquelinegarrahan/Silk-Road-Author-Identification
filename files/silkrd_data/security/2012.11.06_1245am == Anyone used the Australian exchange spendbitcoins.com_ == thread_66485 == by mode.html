				Yea the owner&#039;s legit as it gets and I find usually responds to emails in less than 10mins, and bitcoins delivered within 4hrs (usually nearly instant, then an hour or 2 for it show in your wallet.

				Guy who runs it will go the extra mile for you and is 100% honest. But yep you wont get the best rates, hopefully as he gets more customers he can compete with the bigger guys rates

				I used them for my first BT purchase, fantastic service. Once you confirm, etc you have 4 hours to make the deposit, if not it justs resets.<br />Just make sure you quote the reference number. But yeah they are very quick...just wish bitmarket would get off their arses and put my second lot of coins through...&nbsp; 24hrs and no coins to my SR account&gt;:(

				I use him all the time<br />last transaction i did at 1pm, i still had bitcoins in account in time for order to go out that arvo, got it next day.<br />As mentioned above, he&#039;ll always answer any questions, and find solutions to a fuck , which is rare, as long as you make sure<br />the teller puts the order no on the reciept, that means its been recordered, and you sit, wait, couple hours max.&nbsp; usually.<br />

				i use this guy on a regular basis and have for a while now.<br />generally your BTC will be in within 4 hours and if not it has never been longer than 12 hours in my experience.<br />i would recommend using this guy as good prices and quick deposits.

				I must say Saturday must be a good time to grab bitcoins and shuffle them.<br />I went to the bank this morning, bought my coins(spendbitcoins) and had my comfirmation email within the hour,<br />then bitmarket had them an hour after that, couldnt believe it. But of course confirmation took a little longer.<br />But sat is a good time i think. ;)<br />
