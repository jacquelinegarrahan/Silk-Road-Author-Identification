				Hi guys,<br /><br />first post here.. been over a lot of the threads re shipping to Australia and what no but my biggest issue at the minute is how to buy bitcoins in Australia. It seems easy for overseas sites but I am trying to avoid the international wire fee to buy coins from outside AU. I have found an Australian site that only accepts cash deposits over the counter but I can remember last time ive been in a bank and I certainly aint going into one for this.<br /><br />Can anyone point me to an AU site that allows internet wires for coins?<br /><br />Sorry if this has been covered elsewhere..<br /><br />Cheers

				HI jan2,<br /><br />I posted the same question a while ago and got no reply.<br /><br />About a year ago I was able to use TradeHill (tradehill.com) with no problems at all. Very professional website and service. Only &quot;problem&quot; was that they charged a small fee.<br /><br />However, a couple of months ago they stopped replying to any of my emails. In some bitcoin forums I read that they were having problems and their bank accounts got frozen.<br /><br /><br />Recently, about 4 days ago, I saw a seller on SR offering &quot;Australian bank Transfer = BTC SilkRoad&quot;. He said he charged no fees and only required you to make him a bank deposit and email him your wallet address. The seller specified that he was located in the UK. He had good feedback and customer reviews. So I made the deposit 2 days ago and sent him my wallet address. I have not received bitcoins nor any email from him. After 3 emails the seller has not replied.&nbsp; I cannot remember his SR username. Bad News is his items are not listed anymore! I&#039;m very worried as I sent him a good amount of money. I really hope this is not a scam. I wonder if there is anything I can do about this. I just hope that person is busy and will get back to me soon&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Seller&#039;s email: drcashancarry@gmx.com<br /><br />

				Thanks for your response. I came across Crypto exhchange who had no wire fees so i went with them. Still waiting for transfer to clear but seemed to be pretty straight fwd. Thanks for your info as i will look to that in the future. I also see your thread up the page.<br /><br />Cheers!

				hey guys,<br /><br />Has anyone had any luck finding a good AU site for bitcoins yet?&nbsp; &nbsp;I read of this from another thread in the forum: http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t too sure about it though and any recommendations would be great.

				Oh sweet, this is just what I needed. I&#039;m not going back to tradehill in a fit, mtgox is dicey and bitpiggys rates are too high/he&#039;s frequently out of coin. Cheers!

				Last transfer was around 90mins from deposit to SR so pretty happy with that. CryptoXchange is decent but takes longer and I would only use for larger amnts.
