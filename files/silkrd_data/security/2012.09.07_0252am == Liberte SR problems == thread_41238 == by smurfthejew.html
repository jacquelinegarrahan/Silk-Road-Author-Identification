				Hey guys,<br /><br />I was trying to get on SR through Liberte earlier (currently on a non-torified OS), but I ran into two problems... First, I correctly typed in my username, password, and the captcha for about an hour, and the damn thing still said &quot;Login Failed, please try again&quot;. I then rebooted my computer, went back into Liberte, and now got this error message when I tried to go to SR:<br /><br />503 Forwarding failure<br />Privoxy was unable to socks5-forward your request http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php through 127.0.0.1: socks5 server unreachable<br /><br />Just try again to see if this is a temporary problem, or check your forwarding settings and make sure that all forwarding servers are working correctly and listening where they are supposed to be listening.<br /><br />I&#039;m not super technologically proficient, so if someone could help me out, that&#039;d be great. <br /><br />P.S. I have made it onto SR from Liberte once before...

				Yeah, so switching Tor IDs helped get me on the main login page, but I&#039;m still not able to login. I&#039;ve been copy pasting my password, and I&#039;ve even typed it in, dunno what&#039;s wrong. Not running a virtual machine (I think), just booting off a USB stick on my laptop that usually runs Windows.

				I think if I remember rightly, Liberte has something or other incorrectly configured with Tor, something to do with the clock (out an a limb here), it doesn&#039;t harm your security, but you get a helluva lot of 503 as a result.<br /><br />The fix is to simply keep trying until it works, it&#039;s usually good after that, but it is still annoying.<br /><br />Maxim Kammerer says that you don&#039;t experience these issues when using VMware, VirtualBox or QEMU (i.e. virtual machine software).<br /><br />If you have a specific question to ask, ask it here:<br /><br />http://forum.dee.su/#Forum/libert%C3%A9-linux<br /><br />One day I&#039;ll post up a tutorial on all things to do with Liberte and the Tor Live-CD.

				My apologies, friend: I&#039;ve never used Liberte, and so I can&#039;t really advise you on that.&nbsp; I just hadn&#039;t seen it pointed out that the Tor browser that comes with the bundle is specially configured.&nbsp; Whereas Epiphany (which is the GNOME web browser, BTW) probably isn&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if I sounded flippant.&nbsp; I was just trying to be helpful and make sure you understood your choice to not use it, really.

				Pre-emptive answer if it still happens:<br /><br />Go into your browser preferences (I can&#039;t run ephiphany, I&#039;m getting some undefined symbol error... so I can&#039;t tell you exactly where).&nbsp; Try to find the &quot;network&quot; or &quot;connectivity&quot; options or something.&nbsp; Set the &quot;proxy&quot; to be at address 127.0.0.1, and the &quot;port&quot; to be whatever that command I told you to run had listed under the port Tor is &quot;LISTENING&quot; on.<br /><br />That sort of has to do the trick.

				(again, pre-emptive, since you&#039;re not going to be able to connect when you try this): you can download the browser bundle for linux in Windows, stick it on a USB stick or something, and run it in Liberte.&nbsp; That&#039;s the easy way, and probably safest too.&nbsp; That&#039;s seriously all the help I can give you.

				I&#039;ve seen so many threads with people having problems with Liberte. Seriously, I suggest dropping it and using Tails.<br /><br />Part of the problem seems to be that Liberte uses a Torified version of Epiphany, which is the default Gnome browser.<br /><br />Forget that. Download the Tor Browser Bundle from the Tor web site. <br /><br />Or just use Tails, which comes with TBB. I don&#039;t know what the Liberte developer is thinking with that shitty Torified Epiphany setup.

				Much thanks SS, I&#039;m going to print this page out and run liberte again when I get the chance. If I have more trouble I&#039;ll just come back here and beg for more help.<br /><br />And Astor, I&#039;ll also start looking into tails. As for it coming with the TBB, I tried looking for anything called tails in my Tor folder and did a search after hitting the help button in the vidalia control panel, all to no avail. But I haven&#039;t done one second of research on tails so I might be missing something really important and simple.

				I use Liberte in a vm, and I have experienced the same issue. Not every time, but enough to be frustrating. What tends to work is just refreshing, and switching Tor ID&#039;s. Also make sure your wifi card is compatible with Linux. You can test this by visiting any clearnet sites while running Liberte. Also a question... after typing in your credentials + captcha, do you just hit enter, or do you click the &quot;GO&quot; button? I&#039;ve noticed the problem happens less when clicking the button vs. just hitting enter.

I just get 503 errors, and when trying to correct this, it tells me to check user-level logs.<br /><br />Or, SS, are you just saying that because of my lack of knowledge about programming/whatnot, that I should just screw liberte and run the tor bundle in windows?

Took me a bit to figure it out too as it&#039;s not very intuitive, but it does indeed work as written in the site documentation. As the site explains, by making the system almost entirely read-only, it is (allegedly) far less vulnerable to software exploits.

				If you can tell the me kernel version that Tails 0.16 runs (probably 2.6.32 if it&#039;s based on Debian Squeeze, but I&#039;d like you to check just in case) and the exact hardware of that wireless adapter, I can look into whether it was supported at that point. One of the problems with basing any distro on Debian is that it is ancient in computer terms.<br /><br />To find the kernel version:&nbsp; uname -a<br /><br />To find the exact hardware details:&nbsp; lshw -C network<br />and look for the section that starts:&nbsp; description: Wireless interface<br />copy the line that says:&nbsp; product: &lt;something something&gt; WiFi Adapter<br /><br />BTW, you may have to run some of these commands as root.

				Yeah, if there&#039;s no wlan0 section, then the wireless card isn&#039;t recognized.<br /><br />Next step would be to type:&nbsp; lsusb<br /><br />since it&#039;s a USB device, and see if something related to NetGear or WiFi comes up.<br /><br />Edit: Another thing you can do is download the Ubuntu installer and run that. Just boot it up and don&#039;t install anything. See if it recognizes your wireless card. Most likely it will since it uses a more recent kernel.

				Unfortunately nobody who can post here can post there and vice versa, but if he sees this, one thing I would point out is that you only need Privoxy if the application doesn&#039;t support socks proxies. Privoxy is an http proxy that can forward to Tor&#039;s socks proxy, which is the error that he&#039;s seeing. The failure to forward is probably due to the SR site not being reachable. In other words, the browser bundle equivalent is when you try to access a site and the connection fails. What do we usually do in that case? Refresh the list of relays and get a new identity. Don&#039;t know if he&#039;s tried that.<br /><br />However, there could be problems with Privoxy itself, like default time outs or something. I would suggest downloading the browser bundle (in Liberte) and trying to use that. See if the problems go away. The browser bundle is the recommended way to use Tor anyway. Ephiphany + Privoxy is an awful hack, and just one of several weird design decisions in Liberte.<br /><br />If the browser bundle doesn&#039;t work on Liberte, then I suggest dropping Liberte and using Tails.<br />

So first you boot Liberte, then you use Tor to access SR.

				Astor if i could give you Karma I would but i dont know how to do that either so let me say thank you very much for going out of your way and doing that. I will dowload Liberte now. If I dont do it through TOR is there any security im breaching like allowing others to be able to see the IP it was on etc?

				Theoretically, yes, Practically, no.<br /><br />If you&#039;re paranoid, then announcing that you&#039;re going to download Liberte from Sourceforge isn&#039;t a good idea. LE could get the server logs. How many people do you think will download Liberte in the next 12 hours? Probably not that many. It puts you on a short list of suspects.<br /><br />Practically, LE doesn&#039;t have the time, resources or interest to go after random people who may or may not be low level drug buyers.
