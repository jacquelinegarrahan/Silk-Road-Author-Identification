				Soon (tomorrow afternoon) I will be traveling to a local bank to deposit money into their account, two things I want to know since I am new to bitcoins and SR in general. <br /><br />1. Is this site a scam? It seems rather credible, but I&#039;ve spent a lot of time attempting to get bitcoins it is incredibly frustrating.<br /><br />2. On the site, it asks me what type of account I want them to put the bitcoins in. What would be the right choice in order to put them on SR the quickest and easiest. Here are the options I am given.<br /><br />Mtgox<br />Bitcoin to email<br />VirWox<br />Bitcoin Address<br />Crypto Xchange<br />Paypal<br />Bitstamp<br /><br />I would like someone with some SR/bitcoin experience to tell me the best way to purchase bitcoins in general if this is not the right way. I purchased two $100 visa gift cards LAST night and spent all night searching for a site that would ever trade them. It appears that I&#039;m stuck with these. If someone also knows how to get these sold for bitcoins that would be extremelly helpful too. If not im going to pay cash at the bank tomorrow.<br /><br />https://www.bitinstant.com/home<br />

				Bitinstant is definitely trustworthy! At least for now&nbsp; :-\. I just did business with them today actually and everything went smooth. I made a thread outlining the process I was going to do, but that was about a month ago and I just got around to doing it! The thread is here (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35244.msg401793). <br /><br />Anyways, in that thread I seriously overcomplicated the whole shabang. It&#039;s way simpler than you are thinking. The day I was trying that method, I went with moneygram, but I couldn&#039;t figure out exactly how to fill the forms out so I just said screw it, I will get BTC another way. So, here is exactly what I successfully did, today.<br /><br />1. Went to InstaWallet and bookmarked the address. (I use a Liberte linux OS installed on a jump drive, really nice, there is a thread on it, I recommend doing it.) I also saved it in a file on my desktop, just in case Epiphany cleared the bookmarks for some reason (happened before). The address is http://www.instawallet.org/<br /><br />2. Go to Bitinstant(http://www.bitinstant.com/) and select the &quot;Major Bank Branch&quot; in the &quot;Pay From&quot; drop down box. For the &quot;Pay to&quot; box, put &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot;.<br /><br />3. Copy and paste the instawallet&#039;s address and plug it into address text field. Make sure you double check and make sure the address is correct because if you mess up here your money will be gone entirely. Put the amount of money you want to send in the next box (self explanatory). Now, if you haven&#039;t already, I would make yourself a Tormail.org e-mail. It&#039;s really simple to sign up and its over the onion network, so you can feel safe &amp; secure. Their address is (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/). Just click the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button and make your account. Remember your domain name is &quot;@tormail.org&quot;.<br /><br />4. It should take you to a page that has a green button that says &quot;Go&quot; on it. Click it. It should open up a page from &quot;TrustCash Holdings&quot; or just &quot;TrustCash&quot;. You will need to type in your local zip code and select a location you are comfortable with. Selecting a location close is ideal, unless you feel safer driving across town, it is up to you. Just print the invoice and take it into the bank specified, and do the deal.<br /><br />If you are using Liberte, it may be a pain to print the invoice. What I did was, press print to file, then put the file onto a jump drive which I then printed from a computer that had printer drivers on it.<br /><br />Identification is not required. Just go in there, and do what the invoice says. And yes, the invoice is the piece of paper that has a picture of the street where the bank is, and all other information. Just hand them the invoice, they may ask you a few questions (nothing personal, just like how much you are depositing, etc). Then hand over money, get the receipt, and head home. Job well done!<br /><br />I checked my instawallet account after about an hour and a half, but it was there. From here, you can directly transfer the coins into your SR wallet, or run them through a tumbler like bitcoin fog. With bitcoin fog, you will get your coins sporadically over 6 hours (minimum). I just swooped them over to my SR wallet, though. I read that SR has an internal tumbler, but for some this is just too sketchy.<br /><br />I say, if you are confident, and are only ordering a couple personal amounts of drugs, sending straight to SR is fine. But once you start doing orders $100+ I would most definitely bitcoin fog it.<br /><br />Good luck man and enjoy the road!<br /><br />P.S.<br />Look into the Liberte man! You will not be sorry. There is nothing like being 100% secure and always being on the tor network. All you need is a 1gb+ USB stick and a computer. Check it out. (http://dee.su/liberte) The file will be downloaded from sourceforge, so nothing sketchy here! Plus, the home page for the Tor internet browser has a link to the hidden wiki on it, which has a link to tons of things that are located on the deepnet (including SR). All installation consists of is putting a folder on a jump drive, running a .bat file, then booting from the jump drive and inserting your passwords, etc. It has PGP all pre-configured on it. You just put the jump drive in, load it up, and your on Tor! Not to mention it looks cool also.<br /><br />And, you should also visit the link in my signature to learn about PGP. By the looks of it, you will be making orders here on the road. You will NEED to learn PGP/GPG to make orders safely. Were you just planning on sending your name &amp; address unprotected?! Anyways, you can encrypt it so that ONLY the vendor will be able to decrypt it and read your message!<br /><br />You can message Pine and you will master PGP in no longer than&nbsp; 30 minutes (At least how long it took me on gpa).
