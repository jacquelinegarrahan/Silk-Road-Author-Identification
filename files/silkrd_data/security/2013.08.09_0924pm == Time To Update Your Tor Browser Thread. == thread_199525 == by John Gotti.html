				Everyone should update as soon as they see the update available message when loading up the TBB,&nbsp; it has been quite amazing to read how many people were using long outdated versions when all this mess hit re FH.

				I&#039;m one of the dumbasses that hasn&#039;t upgraded in a while. Don&#039;t worry, I didn&#039;t visit Tormail or anything. I haven&#039;t updated because I don&#039;t know how. I&#039;ve tried downloading and replacing my current bundle but that didn&#039;t work for me. The Tor Project website is not helpful in this department. Can somebody make a tutorial on this? Or point me to one?

				With Tails 0.19, I would enter &quot; sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &quot; in the terminal every time on start up to download recent updates.<br />&nbsp;<br />Just upgraded to Tails 0.20. In the future, should I enter the same command to download any updates&nbsp; issued since 0.20 was released?

But, the browser has java turned on by default. I just have to remember to turn it off.

				Okay fuck this. I tried for a little over an hour last night to update my TBB. I logged on today and it told me &quot;this version [something about HTTPS]&quot;. That made me think I updated it. Then it still had that orange writing that says &quot;there&#039;s a security update&quot;. Now, I can&#039;t load anything because it says firefox is blocking a proxy or something. I thought proxy was only if &quot;.to&quot; was used after a URL. My TBB a virtual paper weight at the moment. Can anybody help?

				The simplest what you can do is backup your bookmarks then delete the whole TBB folder.<br /><br />After this just simply download the new TBB bundle, extract it to wherever you wish, start tor and restore your bookmarks.<br /><br />Let me know if it worked.

Fucking thank you, Vatican. I thought this was too simple to work but it&#039;s running great! You know that feeling when something just works how its supposed to? Yeah, it&#039;s great. I feel more secure already. I forgot what it was like to not see that orange writing saying the TBB is out of date.
