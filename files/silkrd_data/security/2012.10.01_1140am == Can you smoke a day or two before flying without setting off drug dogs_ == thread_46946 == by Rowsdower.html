They most certainly can smell it, no problem. The fact is, at-least in the US, the vast majority of dogs in Airports are sniffing for explosives, not drugs. <br /><br />Funny you should bring this up, I was having a conversation about my travels through airports and being flagged. Dozens upon dozens of times I&#039;ve smoked a big fatty in the car on the way to catch my flight. Sometimes I&#039;ve forgotten about extra &quot;emergency&quot; joint&#039;s I stayed in my bag and made it no problem. Never in those situations has a dog ever alerted to me, even as it passes within inches of me and my bags.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did however get singled out once coming into the US international, at a very hot airport as far as smuggling is concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly certain the protocol was the run the dogs past all bags as they came through customs. The prior week, in a private villa type deal we smoked at least 6oz, all right next to our luggage, etc. Those border patrol pricks waited for us to touch our luggage, asked us to follow them and proceeded to rip through every single stitch of our belongings.<br /><br />Bottom line, yes, given the right set of circumstances (clothes, what you&#039;ve touched, etc), yes they could hit. But, its my experience that while traveling US domestic, most dogs are looking for bomb making material these days. Christ, if the dogs hit on everyone that&nbsp; smoked a joint prior to flight we&#039;d never get through security. ;-)

				also consider the fact that several states have medical marijuana programs/laws which means that some people who walk into the airport will have been smoking pot legally, prior to getting there ... so if the dogs were primarily there for this purpose, then they&#039;d be going crazy!
