				Hi,<br /><br />apparently, HackBB has been hacked, immediately change your PW on all sites you used the same PW for, IF you did use the same PW!<br /><br />I won&#039;t post a link here, if you don&#039;t know what I am speaking of, you don&#039;t have a problem (well, you HAVE anyway, if you are using same passwords for different sites, but not because of this particular incident).<br /><br />

				This has been verified a number of times to my own satisfaction, as well.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly with OP.&nbsp; I use KeePass religiously, but whatever you do, don&#039;t use the same password for all your sites.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a HBB user, and your pw and username match anything else, go change it, time now.&nbsp; +1 to the OP.

				It is pretty depressing. Just directed a guy on here to it an hour or so ago. when he told me it had been hacked I could not believe it...really curious as to how it happened, but I cannot find much about it.

				The kid who hacked it is an idiot. I don&#039;t think he did anything more than gain access o a mod or admins account but who knows at this point.<br /><br />lol Trying to sell passwords to a forum that he deleted all the content from. <br /><br />He should of kept the hack a secret, probably could of profited more

				I tried to earlier, but it said there had been too many unsuccessful attempts on my login, and I had to enter a code - which never appeared.&nbsp; If the person who did this&#039; identity is ever discovered, his life will be made into virtual hell.&nbsp; Of that, there can be no doubt.

				Yeah, the actual attack is over and I talked to OC about it yesterday.&nbsp; They&#039;re in rebuild mode.&nbsp; The hacker has been exploiting people&#039;s PMs, and using whatever info he gleaned from them to try to extort money.&nbsp; If anything, it&#039;s a lesson in deleting your PMs on the regular.
