				1th of all: you&#039;d have to trust me: a complete anonymous stranger. If you don&#039;t, then stop reading here.<br /><br />Since there are many people not knowing how to get BTC&#039;s, I&#039;m willing to offer to do it for you. I will not scam you. All I ask is a 4% commission fee. Which could come down to a few cents, or if it&#039;s about 100 dollars it comes down to 4 dollars, which is still nothing. <br />It will take up to a few days, to maximally 2 weeks before you get your BTC&#039;s on SR.<br />If there is a chance that it might take longer, I&#039;ll give you my btc&#039;s just in case and keep the stuff you gave me. Which could actually have me losing money.<br /><br />This is at your own risk, and also mine.<br />I&#039;m not on here to scam, since I hate scamming in whatever forms.<br /><br />If you are interested an willing to take a risk, send a PM.<br />Though it would probably be cheaper for you to just buy BTC&#039;s yourself without me. I&#039;&#039;m just adding a layer of protection for those who don&#039;t know how to securely get BTC&#039;s.<br />Worst case scenario for me is that the BTC&#039;s get traced back to me. So also I am taking a risk here. <br /><br /><br />

				ps: I will also give advice about PGP encryption for windows. Since asking about that is not very tolerated on here anymore.<br />Anything else I can and will not do. You could have me order something for you, but I do not want to know your address, or take the risks that stuff don&#039;t get delivered.<br /><br />Please check out the fees (if any) for bank wire transfers. <br />Paypal might be possible as well, but I&#039;d have to read into this (like if there are fees to transfer paypal money back to a bank account).<br /><br />

				ps2:<br />If this is going to work, I will have to do cash deposits to get BTCs. This might include an additional fee, but I&#039;m not sure yet. I think that there are no administration costs at the bank, yet.

				ps3:<br /><br />If somebody thinks this might affect my own anonymity, which I think it does not since it&#039;s only btc buying which is legal (and ofcourse I don&#039;t do illegal stuff), or in any other way stupid, let me know.<br /><br /><br />Also, it&#039;s also possible to have btc&#039;s within 1-3 days. But that way it&#039;s easier to track the btc&#039;s so I wouldn&#039;t recommend that.<br />But if that&#039;s what you want then it&#039;s ok though.

				Alright, this could seem like a scam. But don&#039;t forget that I&#039;m also taking a risk here. Since how would I explain money coming from different locations?<br />Therefore paypal to paypal would seem most riskfree to me, but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />For me bank wire transfers within EU are free, so I would recommend this. <br />1% fee for me is almost nothing. But I&#039;m trying to build up an easy and relatively fast way to buy BTC;s. While fast depends on how quick your bank acts and how fast it can be to anonymize the BTC;s.<br />My guess would be a working week + 1 day. Maximum of 2 weeks.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to transfer big amounts, you can also send small amounts.<br />Be sure that your bank doesn&#039;t add transfer fees, which they shouldn&#039;t when it&#039;s EU-EU.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to anyone to decide to do this or not. There is always a risk of me being a scammer.<br />But I am pro drugs. pro SR and pro anonymous. So I personally don&#039;t see the reason to scam.<br />Even though most trials MIGHT lead to me. So perhaps a 1% fee would be too little for myself. The other 1-3% is for anonymizing it for 100%.<br />Maybe my fee would go up a bit. Depending on how big the transfers are and how many customers I get.<br /><br />Decide for yourself. If you don&#039;t want to do it, that&#039;s fine. If you do want to do it, I can give free support on PGP as well (currently only for windows though).<br /><br />

				Ok, I guess there is no way of proving I&#039;m legit.<br />Which is making this a bit hard.<br /><br />Once again, I don&#039;t believe scamming is good in any way. Actually it only decreased reputation as a customer, or as a vendor.<br /><br />The only way to know for sure would be, I guess, to buy small amounts first. (BE SURE TO CHECK AT YOUR BANK IF IT COSTS ANYTHING TO USE A EU WIRE TRANSFER!!! Otherwise you will lose some money).<br /><br />People buying BTC&#039;s have the risk to not get BTC&#039;s, which I am principally against. While I have the risk of getting questions about all these transfers, which I would have to deny in some way.<br />Plus I do all the work, just for 1%.<br /><br />Okay maybe this is an insane post by me since I take way more risk. <br />Just thought of helping out new people, and decreasing the same questions over and over again on this forum.<br /><br />Last thing I can say is: I&#039;m pro BTC, pro ANONIMITY and very much PRO SR.<br /><br />Believe it or not, your choice.<br />Oh, and scammers usually created several (usually transperent) accounts to back this up. I will not.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you. You can check it with as little as .. lets say, $5. <br />Yes ofcourse I could steal that. But 1% fee for 10.000 transactions will be better than just stealing $25, or something.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like this. Have a happy experience with SR either way&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				So let me get this straight.<br /><br />1) You are new or hiding behind an alias.<br />2) You want to do transactions off the record. No escrow and no proof of anything.<br />3) You&#039;re targeting newbies, those that are unfamiliar with the system and its risks.<br />4) Your service takes up to a couple weeks for coins to clear.<br />5) You repeatedly say &quot;I hate scammers,&quot; and &quot;I take all the risks&quot; (except, of course, for the risk of SENDING AN ANONYMOUS STRANGER YOUR MONEY) in practically every post.<br />6) You&#039;re unsure of your own anonymity risks and such. You&#039;re asking us to PM you if we notice something you fucked up.<br /><br />Kindly delete your thread.

				First off there a couple reason why commuinty as really stop helping the get started newbies. 1. First reason is all the information is in the forum, Countless times over and over, there is a search function on SR. 2. Secondly, it severs as a filter, so that less retarded people get to make purchases. God its not that hard to learn something new, yea its a hassle but once you get used to it, its that bad. And to be honest, this idea that you have, is not that great. You would probably have better luck making a btc vendor account on here. Because thats basically what your doing. Also BTC and Paypal dont work too good together alot of people have lost alot of money doing it.

				I haven;t read everything since it&#039;s just bashing me.<br /><br />I&#039;m just offering a solution to people who are either unaware of how yo buy BTC&#039;s or how to erase trails leading back to them.<br /><br />The -2 karma on me makes no sense. I would have no reason to be a scammer. Like I said I take 1% of a fee for doing this, and since people get to see my actual bank details I&#039;m putting myself at risk as well.<br /><br />I do understand there is a huge amount of scammers everywhere on the net, but why would I scam for 1%, or even take all the money? I am pro SR, pro anonimity, anti feds and all of that.<br />There is no need to give bad karma, at all. You can either trust me, or you don&#039;t. But giving bad karma without knowing shit is really ignorant.<br /><br />1% fee is nothing compared to the work I have to do to keep the clients BTC secure. And like I said, I MIGHT use other sites, which take 1-3% of a fee. If you get 1 btc, then what the hell would 1,2,3,4% fee matter?<br /><br />There is a bigger risk for me, than for any customers. And I think the comments on here are pretty dumb.<br /><br />My post had a positive intention, and yes I could be a scammer. But there are a lot smarter ways to scam. So please fuck off with bad karma while knowing nothing. It seems legit to me to give me bad karma after you purchaced, lets say, 0.05BTC.<br /><br /><br />I hope you have some intelligence and see what I&#039;m doing here. Which is putting myself more at risk than potential buyers.<br />Such a shame for the bad feedback. Then again, who cares, I can always make a new account.<br /><br />Either trust me or you don&#039;t. There is no need for me to scam since I hate scammers and have enough funds myself.<br /><br />Believe this or not, your choice. Give bad karma, also your choice. The advantage of tor is that everybody is anonymous, which means I can just create a new account. But I won&#039;t do that.<br /><br />Giving bad karma without knowing shit and basing things on assumptions makes you quite moronic. I hope you can understand this.<br />Also, read my other posts. Did they seem like scamming? No. So why the negative karma?<br /><br />If this doesn&#039;t work, I will just go to a site who keeps records of people. But I don&#039;t see why, since also they can scam you, and it might even be less anonymous.<br /><br />Think again before posting bullshit about me. This is a service and you can use it or not.<br />And I never said anything about 6 weeks. I said 1-2 weeks, because that&#039;s how long bitfog takes, but I try to avoid bitfog for faster transactions.<br /><br />

				I;m trying to help out new people and am considered a fraud, troll, whatever.<br />Still I spend lots of time to reply to messages while in the meantime I could have made more money.<br />Its such a shame though. New people get send to &quot;search&quot; which doesnt always help out as people want to.<br /><br />Too bad good people get flamed. Even if I was a scammer, it would fill up this thread.<br /><br />I even offer the opportunity to send it anonymously to SR within 1-2 weeks, or within a few days. Ofcourse I could disregard trust, but why would I? I would take myself into a lot of shit, since being legit seems more comfortable and will generate more money. (even though 1% of 1 btc is almost nothing). I&#039;m happy to help out. Also with pgp encryption (for windows). Instead of complaining that it was already asked some days ago and hidden in the search function.<br /><br />Here is my reply to the comments:<br />First off there a couple reason why commuinty as really stop helping the get started newbies. 1.

Up to you to believe that or not.<br />And how would I make a huge profit from 1-2% profit. On 1 btc that would be nearly nothing. On 100btc that would be 1 btc. What is your problem?<br /><br />So let me get this straight.<br /><br />1) You are new or hiding behind an alias.<br />2) You want to do transactions off the record.

And I&#039;m new to SR.<br />2: yes, no escrow, that sucks, if I found out of another way to program that, I would. That&#039;s why I recommend small amounts of BTC&#039;s. Besides: people get to see a real name. Which is is bigger risk than losing 0.001BTC, right?<br />3. Ofcourse I&#039;m targeting newbies, since most of them dont understand the bitcoins system, or how to be anonymous. Ive already given lots of advice to it to friends and also gave them the btc;s they asked for. <br />4. Can be a couple of weeks, but also just 2 days. Depending on how white-washed people things want to be.<br />5. I dont know how to answer that. I just hate scammers and I wish SR to become a good site for selling/buying dope. Being scammed sucks. And by the way, people can be scammed IRL way easier, which I also dont approve of.<br />6. I dont understand that. What I said was that it seems a bit weird that I get money from random people and I&#039;ll have to (or not) explain that. But I;&#039;m sure that wont be a problem. Although it might. If it would be a problem, Id still send the btc&#039;s and it will be my loss.<br /><br />I will not kindly remove this thread, since I&#039;m very sincere about offering help to those who have difficulties figuring stuff out themselves. And I don&#039;t see any problem with this. Actually it saved irritation from people who keep repeating themselves: use the search function. While the results do not always show what people search for.<br /><br />First off there a couple reason why commuinty as really stop helping the get started newbies. 1.

Also BTC and Paypal dont work too good together alot of people have lost alot of money doing it.&quot;<br /><br />I am aware of paypal-btc. But I can easily transfer paypal cash to bank, then convert it into btc. Although Im not sure of fees and thats why I&#039;m currently declining to do it this way.<br /><br />Being a vendor would make me more money, but since I don&#039;t have a steady supply and could only sell a limited amount of oldskool stuff, it doesn&#039;t seem like something Id like to do. Otherwise I would ofcourse.<br /><br />&quot;troll.&quot;<br /><br />Based on what evidence? None? Congrats to you for making a bullshit assumption. I am no troll. A troll would evoke emotions, I don&#039;t. Google troll and then come back to make any sense.<br /><br /><br />PS: do not forget that if things go wrong, you can always give me bad credits on this forum. And I recommend sending small offers, and I also try to transfer the euro&#039;s dollars to the lowest BTC price available (unless you&#039;re on a hurry).<br /><br />----<br />First off there a couple reason why commuinty as really stop helping the get started newbies. 1.

Besides: people get to see a real name. Which is is bigger risk than losing 0.001BTC, right?<br />3. Ofcourse I&#039;m targeting newbies, since most of them dont understand the bitcoins system, or how to be anonymous. Ive already given lots of advice to it to friends and also gave them the btc;s they asked for. <br />4. Can be a couple of weeks, but also just 2 days. Depending on how white-washed people things want to be.<br />5. I dont know how to answer that. I just hate scammers and I wish SR to become a good site for selling/buying dope. Being scammed sucks. And by the way, people can be scammed IRL way easier, which I also dont approve of.<br />6. I dont understand that. What I said was that it seems a bit weird that I get money from random people and I&#039;ll have to (or not) explain that. But I;&#039;m sure that wont be a problem. Although it might. If it would be a problem, Id still send the btc&#039;s and it will be my loss.<br /><br />I will not kindly remove this thread, since I&#039;m very sincere about offering help to those who have difficulties figuring stuff out themselves. And I don&#039;t see any problem with this. Actually it saved irritation from people who keep repeating themselves: use the search function. While the results do not always show what people search for.<br /><br />First off there a couple reason why commuinty as really stop helping the get started newbies. 1. First reason is all the information is in the forum, Countless times over and over, there is a search function on SR. 2. Secondly, it severs as a filter, so that less retarded people get to make purchases. God its not that hard to learn something new, yea its a hassle but once you get used to it, its that bad. And to be honest, this idea that you have, is not that great. You would probably have better luck making a btc vendor account on here. Because thats basically what your doing. Also BTC and Paypal dont work too good together alot of people have lost alot of money doing it.&quot;<br /><br />I am aware of paypal-btc. But I can easily transfer paypal cash to bank, then convert it into btc. Although Im not sure of fees and thats why I&#039;m currently declining to do it this way.<br /><br />Being a vendor would make me more money, but since I don&#039;t have a steady supply and could only sell a limited amount of oldskool stuff, it doesn&#039;t seem like something Id like to do. Otherwise I would ofcourse.<br /><br />&quot;troll.&quot;<br /><br />Based on what evidence? None? Congrats to you for making a bullshit assumption. I am no troll. A troll would evoke emotions, I don&#039;t. Google troll and then come back to make any sense.<br /><br /><br />-----<br />

I can give my word that I wont scam ever. I&#039;d be happy to get 1 dollar for 10btc;s. Which makes me seem like a bum actually, which I;m not.<br /><br />Try, or dont. Take a risk, or don&#039;t. <br />I can only say I wont disappoint you.<br /><br />Hopefully the amount of time Ive put into writing this might help a bit.<br /><br />If not, I can still help with PGP related stuff. Ofcourse you can find it on here, but the search function might be confusing.

				Sigh.. too bad people see everything as sketchy and give bad comments/karma.<br /><br />I was just willing to help out people who have difficulty understanding the BTC and PGP principles.<br /><br />Then again, on SR you can never be paranoid enough...<br /><br />For me it&#039;s just easy to make btc;s anonymous. Perhaps as a policy I shouldn&#039;t take in more than 1 btc per time, to prove myself.<br /><br />I actually believe in karma, and if I steal then it will get back to me, either by wrong dope, or whatever.<br /><br />1-4% (depending on how anonymous is has to be, doesnt seem any siginificant to me). Wow I got 1 dollar, now I&#039;m rich.. or 10 cents.. Come on guys.<br /><br />The biggest risk here is that my bank starts asking questions. Unfortunately this issue is totally ignored.<br />Thanks a lot you paranoid freaks...<br /><br />I anybody knows of any way how I can prove I&#039;m legit, let me know. Cuz this is just depressing me...<br />Who the fuck needs many BTC&#039;s while having shitloads already? Just makes NO sense.<br /><br />

				Know what? Keep on bashing people who don;t use the search function(know how to use them correctly) while giving them no answers whatsoever and even bad karma.<br /><br />A shame that people who want to help out for ONE FUCKING percent are bashed upon.<br />Even worse considering that there are many vendors selling legit stuff, until people bulk order.<br /><br />Nobody even cares to test. Yeah its easier to bash/flame.<br /><br />I could sell btc&#039;s on sites, but they include bigger fees. So I just thought this would be better.

				Thx for the tip, but actually I need BTC&#039;s myself. It would be more appropriate to put an amount in at a site and sell them to a specific user. But current prices are pretty much gone immediately.<br /><br />Does bitcoin otc include a fee? Some other site I used did which pretty much sucked.<br /><br />If they don;t then I might try that out. Then again, why not use bitstamp...<br /><br />Really too bad.

				Ok, as a layer of protection:<br />If the BTC thing does not work, I would just transfer back the money.<br />If people want other ways to buy BTC;s then they can ask me, same for using PGP encryption.<br /><br />Besides that, people will get to see a real name of my account which could compromise me in the sense that they could physically detect me.<br />Unless paypal is used, but I heard about a fee for that, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend that.<br /><br />Vendors can also not ship at all, and assuming reship while they don&#039;t.<br /><br />So I can not see this as a scam in any form. Yes I could start scamming with larger amounts. But that&#039;s why I advice them to start with small amounts. <br />And ofcourse it will take longer if I try to get the BTC&#039;s for a low price, which might take days and that depends on how the BTC market goes.<br />Faster transfer will then mean getting 1 BTC for 11.5 to 12 dollars each.<br />Completely white washing will take a week as far as I know. So then people need to be patient.<br />I can also get the BTC;s on SR within 2 days. Depending on where they are from and how fast their bank operated. Might be 1 day, might be 2.<br /><br />I think it would be scamming if I;d keep a 100%, or ask a 10+% fee. 1% is nothing.<br /><br />An escrow kind of system would be nice, but there isn;t any. So this is a matter of trust. And I can honestly say that I can not live with myself by scamming people.<br />Believe me or not, that&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />Perhaps it would be wise to scan this forum for scammers and how they communicate. (usually with CAPS on, or just 1 or 2 sentences)<br /><br />Once again, I understand the paranoia and I know there is no way of proofing myself.<br /><br />As a reply to me using a fake account or whatever: this is my first account and I think it&#039;s a shame that I get minusses for being nice. Which is also silly according to that logic, since I could always make a new account. But I don&#039;t want to, as explained before.<br /><br />To protect myself I will only take on a small amount of orders from the same person, while explaining how to do it themselves. It saves people getting irritated for newbies not using the search function.<br /><br />I don;&#039;t think I can elaborate on this any further. Take the offer, or don&#039;t.<br />Please save the negative karma for if I would ever scam, which I will never do.<br /><br />Best of luck to all of you, also to the ones who gave neg feedback. Maybe it could be rolled back. Otherwise Id just have to live with it I suppose...<br /><br />

				True. @ caprainmal<br /><br />I can only say I&#039;d purchase BTC&#039;s for as low as possible with the amount of money that gets on my account. If that is without fees or whatever, then that&#039;s what they get in BTC&#039;s.<br />It depends on how long they want to wait (with washing, going for the lowest prices atm). If they are in a hurry than it will take 1 day, unless it takes more days for bank-bank transfer.<br /><br />I do agree on people having to be paranoid. I&#039;m just saying they don&#039;t have to be with me.<br />But I can understand if they still are. And since 1% is almost nothing, I don&#039;t really care either unless people make 1000 dollar transfers, which will get me 10 dollars, which basically still is nothing.<br /><br />So I leave it up to the readers. If I might scam, they will know my full name and perhaps bank details. So I wouldn&#039;t even dare to scam.<br /><br />I will say nothing more. If people from UK or US cant get BTC;s anymore and dont trust random people like me who take hours of time to reply to everything, then that&#039;s their problem, not mine.<br /><br />Selling bitcoins can be against the rules, but if it happens through pm then rules can be broken. <br /><br />Trust me, or don&#039;t. I don&#039;t care anymore. This topic is utter shit and I got negative feedback by people assuming that I&quot;m a scammer. Which tells me more about then than that their feedback tells about me.<br /><br />Lesson learned: dont try to help people with anything, btc, pgp, vendors, security. People are too paranoid to analyze posts and recognize the bad from the good.<br />I can still do whatever on SR so whatever.

				Oh yeah, like it would be so bad if you transferred $11.5 into my account and got 1btc for it.<br />That would be really shitty helping somebody out who doesn&#039;t seem to be able to get btc from their country.<br /><br />Everything can be discussed through pm so you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a scammer and whatever feelings you have will not change a fucking thing about it.<br /><br />I wasnt aware that helping people is a crime nowadays, thanks for the info.

				Ah yeah I could pay you 0.08btc, but for what? 1 btc? I don;t think so. Might be nothing at all.<br />Feedback: very funny.<br /><br />Go you for being an honest vendor. You totally suck and once I can give you bad feedback I definitely will. Dipshit.<br /><br />You also dont understand the concept of transferring money and getting it back from bank to bank. I could not possible rip people off.<br /><br />And whether or not I offer help to people is my business and my business alone. So keep your crap to yourself. Perhaps adding sites at which people could buy BTC&#039;s would make more sense. To me you&#039;re just a low selling scumbag fraud.

				Ok, you make a good point. But how do people buy btc without btc&#039;s? You seem to be asking btcs for btcs?<br /><br />Either way I can sell them on any legit site, with real cash. Either here or somewhere else.<br /><br />My only goal was to support people who don&#039;t know how to get btc&#039;s and use them securely.<br />If they are paranoid, ofcourse they shouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />Too bad paranoia is excessive on here. All I can say is that I want to help people out.<br />And I don&#039;t think a vendor account would be needed, since fees apply.<br /><br />Once again: people would get my real info, so it&#039;s a risk that goes both ways. If people don&#039;t like that, then they shouldn&#039;t believe me. Otherwise I think I&#039;m able to make nice deals without making a significant profit. What is 1% to 1 btc? 12 cents? Wow that would make me rich instantly -.-<br /><br />You have a vendor account and can still say that the transfer went wrong while actually you did not transfer anything.<br />It all comes down to trust. With you, with me, and with whatever vendor.<br />The downside is that on here a vendor can put you on a blacklist, even though he&#039;s lying.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t see a problem in helping people out this way. They get info about pgp, tor, everything.<br />There are more profitable ways to make a profit, for example, going rogue as a vendor.<br /><br />If people are too paranoid, I don;t care, 1% is nothing. It would also bring negative attention to me through this forum.<br /><br />SO they&#039;ll just have to decide for themselves.<br /><br />I;m outta here. Helping people gets you punished. If anyone is interested, pm me. I can give current rates and the stuff I mentioned before.<br />

				Ok, I wasnt aware of the Vendor thing to buy BTC;s. I looked at the other account and saw 0.08BTC, which seems strange to me because: how do you buy btc&#039;s when the problem is you don&#039;t know how to get BTC&#039;s?<br /><br />The thing: send me 5 btcs and I&#039;ll give you money doesn&#039;t make any sense, since I want to deliver BTC&#039;s instead of getting them.<br /><br />So ok, this does not work through the forum. And I totally understand that it can be considered as not trustworthy. Since yeah, I could always decline getting money (though your bank and my bank can prove it but that is to either one of us, since they do not share information with people that do not own the account).<br /><br /><br />Perhaps somebody could explain to me how this works through a vendor account. I thought you needed BTC&#039;s for everything but I guess I was wrong. I&#039;m also unaware that you could place dollars into an account. So that IS possible? If so, is it also possible to buy with dollars instead of BTC&#039;s?<br /><br />The minimum of 2 days would be because of bank-&gt;bank. The 1% would be for me doing the work getting the btc&#039;s to you, which I could do withing approximately 12 hours or less. But if you&#039;d want them to be really clean (or I would since they then are tracable to me), then it will take up to 1-2 weeks and 1-3% would go off the amount. See bitfogs policy about that.<br />Though I don&#039;t think bitfog is the only way, and therefore I think it would just be 1%. More % depending on the method you&#039;d want to use.<br /><br />Obviously this is not going to work through the forum. I also don&#039;t know every rule of the SR forum.<br />For this I apologize. This was not meant to be a scam.<br />Too bad I got bad karma for this, since I didn&#039;t actually harm or scam people. But just for trying to help out the people who do not understand how to get BTC&#039;s at all, or get them here safely.<br /><br />Either way, I will not do this then, since it seems to annoy people more than actually helping them.<br />Since I do not understand how I can sell BTC to people who do not have BTC in their account, perhaps somebody could explain to me how that works, or give a link to a place on this forum on how this works. <br /><br />&quot;if you continue to try to advertise these offers without a vendor acct (whether it be selling anything, coins - even advice) they may be considered spam and removed since you have been told multiple times it is against SR guidelines and you blatantly state you dont care and will circumvent the rules by conducting business through PMs&quot;<br /><br />I said that it would be impossible to check what happens in PM&#039;s since they should be private and I think SR should respect that.<br />I won&#039;t go against their rules now I know about it. Selling products other than BTC would seem stupid to me anyway, because SR is for that (even though it costs more, there is a lot more security if things go wrong (escrow system, SR resolving issues).<br /><br />So, my apologies for causing this mess out here. I am a happy SR user and I hope it stays that way. I hate scammers and it sucks I&#039;m considered being one now. <br /><br />Happy SR&#039;ing, and I&#039;d better post in threads where people do not understand things, instead of trying to do the work for them. Thanks for pointing this out.<br /><br />

				I apologize for being insulting here and this in this thread. It seems I was overconfident that people would see that I;m not a scammer. But how would anybody know that for sure? (they can&#039;t).<br /><br />I will go by the rules, do no &quot;transactions&quot; through pm&#039;s and if I understand enough about btc trading through being a vendor I will do that.<br /><br /><br />Any help on how to do this as a vendor would be appreciated. But with all the crap in this thread I will expect nothing anymore.<br /><br />Happy SR&#039;ing. And what microRNA said is true: &quot;new members - please do not trust any non-vendors making offers on the forum as you are likely to be scammed. please report this member if he tries to do business through the forum or PMs any more&quot;<br /><br />Scamming is so easy that its best not to trust easily on SR. Even legit vendors can go rogue :(<br />Me thinking I could ask for being seen as legit was very naive of me. Even though I would never steal. I&#039;m more of a donating guy. But all of that shouldn&#039;t matter to anyone.<br /><br />Peace out and happy SR&#039;ing!

				on thing is if you have a vendor acct then people can leave feedback on their transactions so their is a record of your business<br /><br />you will only be able to scam a few people on SR rather than on the forums through PM where there is no method to keep track of what is occurring and whether you are actually paying out for the money you receive
