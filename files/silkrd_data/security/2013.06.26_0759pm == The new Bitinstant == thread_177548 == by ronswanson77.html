				Is the new Bitinstant safe to use?&nbsp; This has probably been discussed elsewhere but I couldn&#039;t find it anywhere with the searches I made.<br /><br />Any coins I buy I always transfer through a couple anonymous tor-accessed only accounts and then I also transfer them through Bitcoin fog.&nbsp; Is this enough to make the coins &#039;clean&#039; when I use them on SR?&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the idea of giving anyone my information but it&#039;s getting harder and harder to get BTC without doing so.&nbsp; Localbitcoins.com is not an option for me as where I live there are not local BTC vendors.&nbsp; I used to use Dwolla but they are now requiring validated accounts for transfers to Bitinstant or Mtgox.&nbsp; I could buy coins from a vendor on SR but I don&#039;t like to unless it&#039;s a last resort.<br /><br />Again; sorry if this has already been discussed somewhere else.

				I think what you describe is fine, provided you don&#039;t actually give BitInstant your real identification and access it via Tor somehow.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;d think it can be tied to you if they try really, really hard -- but I&#039;ve never actually tried to do that, so I could be wrong here...<br /><br />I think it comes down to &quot;how paranoid are you,&quot; in the end.&nbsp; It sounds fine to me, but if you&#039;re a bigshot vendor -- well actually, if you&#039;re a bigshot vendor, you wouldn&#039;t need to buy coins, would you...

				Bitinstants &#039;redesign&#039; had nothing to do with improving the aesthetics of their site. It had everything to do with complying with regulations or being shut down by the Feds. How is it if I put fake info in their website that it has a database that can check that? What kind of database would you need that holds every US and even Canadians person info(I had canadian friends try it to).&nbsp; Charlie Shrem is MIA and has been unable to comment. You would think if someone rolled out a new and improved version of there site with new features and it looks nicer you would hear a little self promotion but instead nothing. I might be a pretty paranoid person but I think it&#039;s served me well over the years and having a background in web development I tell you having a database that Bitinstant has is no small feat and not something I think they themselves could have built and redesigned in that short time frame that the site was down. I&#039;ll let you come to your own conclusions but for me IF I was to use Bitinstant it would be someone elses(real) persons info and that&#039;s a big IF. The government is basically saying we have no problem with Bitcoins but their actions prove they&#039;re waging an all out assualt to stop it by applying the same regulations to it as currency when in fact it&#039;s a commodity. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I have not bought coins in over a month. I was using Bitinstant then upping to mtgox then cleaning through several different cleaners.<br /><br />Today I went to check out bitinstant and it is totally different. It&#039;s the only real way I can get coins that I know of. And, now I cannot. I never get more than 2 btc. Now I am worried that I&#039;ll never be able to get coins or my medical marijuana again. =( <br /><br />I am not near a bank of America..I have no clue on how to get them any other means. I have checked different methods but, always get confused in the end. <br /><br />Any &quot;helpful&quot; information would be great.

				localbitcoins = too much of a chance of dealing with LEO.&nbsp; SR has been a nightmare to them because of jurisdiction and anonymity, don&#039;t give them the chance to unmask you.&nbsp; Also don&#039;t think they don&#039;t know about localbitcoins.&nbsp; Today&#039;s LEO is really well organized and has a lot of continuous training.

				You can register with fake info, it just has to be real fake info now. They will then ask you 3 questions to &quot;verify&quot; that you are who you say you are. You can find some of the answers if you don&#039;t mind running background checks and doing your research. It took me a decent amount of effort to answer the questions correctly, but it is possible. After you get verified it works the same way as it used to. I&#039;m sure there are better ways to get your bitcoins now, but for how long? I doubt the government runs the site now, even if they do you shouldn&#039;t be transferring bitcoins straight to SR anyways.

Like if it said Date of Birth incorrect then you&#039;d know. But what I was saying most sites when it comes to form validation follow a certain pattern of error checking. Like for example I had one persons info but they had two last names so something like Bobby Jones. Now I entered that in and got rejected however that info was pulled from there bank records so I was like hmmm..so I went ahead and just put in Jones and it worked. I think they have some sort of safeguard that&#039;s trying to prevent fraud. Like if someone comes to the site that safeguard will watch for a certain pattern and if it notices it then you get an error. I&#039;m probably spending too much time thinking about it but it&#039;s my field so w/e lol.... in terms of buying bitcoins buying local is always a good choice even though I&#039;m not afraid to use Bitinstant cause I&#039;m not a big buyer/seller.

				Bitinstant now allows you to pay through your bank account with an iphone app. It&#039;s basically like coinbase now except its instant. So if you are cool with coinbase, i don&#039;t see whats the difference in trusting bitinstant in this regard.

				For the 50th million time, bitcoins are not illegal, Bitcoins are not used only for SR. Bitcoins have a different purpose, people need to realize this. If you want to remain more anonymous yes buying threw a local btc trader is the way to go, pay cash. Sr has a tumbler bulit in. The only advantage, that local BTC has is different rates and more anonymous. Hell sometimes you can get them without fees. BUT that besides the point. IF they ever do become illegal, just move your btc to a different wallet put that on a flash drive.&nbsp;

Learn everything about you. Where you go, what you do... sure keep the house clean but the drugs have to be somewhere right? Listen I&#039;m not trying to start an argument all I&#039;m saying is once your on the radar it&#039;s impossible to get off. Idk if you&#039;re trading Bitcoins a lot the ideal option is to have a front for it. A seemingly legitimate way that makes Bitcoins for you but acutally doesn&#039;t. Your right though Bitcoins are not illegal but I think we can say most of the ppl here are using them to do something illegal so of course we&#039;re going to be cautious.

				The whole point of bitinstant was that you used it to avoid long verification and funding delays on exchanges and instead you could buy a small amount of coins right away or move funds quickly into the exchanges. Lol now that site is pretty useless since you now have to verify and wait.. and then wait again for them to process your order in the backlog they always have. <br /><br />Localbitcoins. Bitcointalk or IRC p2p trade is the solution. Stop supporting banks, corporations and middlemen just trade off each other. <br />

				I just used bitinstant for a smallish transaction. It was all quick as it used to be. You just have to have someone&#039;s legit info and pass the quiz. It&#039;s not that hard. I had 3 confirmations within like 20 minutes of leaving the moneygram place

However those with the pov &quot;why worry? Btc is not illegal&quot; are naive at best - anarchy cat could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and shit a better argument.&nbsp; At a presentation all had to attend at an educational institution for which i am an independent contractor , LE rep said Bitcoin is used for illegal purposes (child porn and drugs) and that was it, period. (Also-&quot; Line-X&nbsp; is used by hackers&quot; with stern look and emphasis on haackers! was one of his gems as well. The facts do not matter to &quot;them&quot; as we know trueth and other...dont get me started.&nbsp; That if there is btc software on a machine they want to know who, period. LEO went so far as to say that they could be grounds for being fired. Also TOR True Crypt, PGP. He even said &quot;write these down&quot; and proceeded with (to me , laughable explanations of what these programs are and do and there was No legitimate uses even mentioned) They are engaged in controlling dialogue and the meaning of words (as they have with hacker, feminist, etc. and have upped the game) and not even just scare the normies but make them feel they are helping make the world better by reporting these child predators and depraved drug addicts. The old &quot;if you arent doing anything wrong...&quot;&nbsp; was the underlying philosophy and questioning it made one suspect. The reality is &quot;they&quot;do not play by rules such as &quot;legal&quot; or not. I think we need to make sure as mny ppl as we can get to install and hopelulzy use these programs do so. Then its a war of #s More of us than them&quot; and it will be harder to isolate individuals in a larger movement. Cryptoparties indeed.&nbsp; I look forward to work arounds soon, its been challenging and so far not enough Time to be successful.

				My fellow SR users to clear the mass confusion I&#039;d just like to say that for your average SR user who spends $300-$500 buying Bitcoins I don&#039;t think you need to be really too worried even if you use your real info. However common sense rules still apply. Keeping a clean house. Keeping a low key profile in real life. Not looking like a crackhead. These things set of more alarms. <br /><br />Ok so let&#039;s say that I&#039;m LE cause my theory is always to devise a plan of defense you have to think what would your enemy be doing to try to get you. So here I am a LE agent looking through the transactions from Bitinstant(let&#039;s assume LE has a backdoor with the Bitinstant database)... ok so they see your name that you bought 3 Bitcoins. For some reason they look into further by following those Bitcoins through the network which isn&#039;t hard but it&#039;s not something your average LE agent can do. So this means it needs to be brought higher up, which means more manpower which means more money spent from there budget. <br /><br />Now let&#039;s assume that this LE agent deems that in your case it is worthwhile to proceed. So they do the trace and they somehow manage to see that it got to a SR address(even though SR has a built in tumbler). I find it very unlikely they would be able to trace to the SR address but say they do they still can&#039;t prove anything however now they&#039;re small chubby has turned into a raging hard on. <br /><br />What they would try to do is monitor the network and try to catch your exit relay which also means more department budget money being spent hoping to catch some unencrypted address info or any real info that can tie you to the that Bitinstant order. But really it&#039;s one hell of a goose chase for LE for a result your unsure of. <br /><br />If someone is stupid enough not to use PGP when sending vendors their address info then that&#039;s one thing but the other thing to consider assuming all of this happened and you were caught is how exactly would the courts prove that you used Tor to access Silk Road to order that specific package when all information over Silk Road is encrypted? They could prove you used Tor. You can use bridge to avoid that. VPN&#039;s. <br /><br />I encourage everyone to be cautious and paranoid but let&#039;s add to that also a bit of reasoning and common sense. Security measures are meant to be broken. There are so many ways to keep safe doing what we do. That being said I still don&#039;t like Local Bitcoins. Something about that just screams SKETCH to me but that&#039;s my own personal opinion. <br /><br />I would think using Local Bitcoins would be more of a risk than Bitinstant cause here I&#039;ve meet a person in R/L who could have a third person watching over the meet area, looking to see what car I leave in, get my plate #, run it through the DMV database and bingo. You see. Now you tell me hypothetically with all that being said which seems more risky. Ya I know the guys on Local Bitcoins are stand up dudes. LE would never pose as Local bitcoin seller...what are you crazy? <br /><br />**edit**The last scenario only applies to someone that&#039;s buying large amounts of BTC for small buyers I doubt that would happen.<br />
