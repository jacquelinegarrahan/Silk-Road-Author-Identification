				Since the site is being attacked would there be any worry about funds not making it to your SR account if they were sent recently? Any input from those who have an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects and cryptography would be great. Thanks.

				As far as I know, adding funds to your bitcoin SR wallet/account still gets processed by whatever Bitcoin provider agent you deal with, so it&#039;s quite safe, except obviously from any volatility of the BTC value.<br /><br />I&#039;m posing a similar question, maybe more out of the control of SR: <br /><br />When the site is getting royally wrecked in the rectum from whatever fuckwit is DDoS&#039;ing it, the transactions in Escrow still go through as per the escrow clock, right? So, if we had many purchases going through escrow with 2-3 days left on the auto-finalize clock, do we come back to the site a few days later to find our auto-finalize rate and therefore buyer stats are fucked? Will vendors take this into account when the site is back up?<br /><br />I know on the scale of things, this might seem miniscule, but it&#039;s concerning for a MASSIVE number of silk-road buyers. It effects everybody and has massive implications on all sides of the cube with a problem like this.<br /><br />Are a lot of our buyer stats going to get raped from this? Or lose money from Auto-finalizing outside of our control for, perhaps, packages that never arrive? I&#039;d say the losses this DoS attack are going to be fucking huge, especially with how much clientele and commission make up the infrastructure of this global business

No Auto Finalization. Right now though I would not be sending funds to my SR wallet, in all honesty, it may be a while before we see SR up and running right.
