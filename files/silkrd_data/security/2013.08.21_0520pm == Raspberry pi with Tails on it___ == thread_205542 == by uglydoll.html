				Hi<br /><br />So yesterday i got myself a RASPBERRY PI for xmbc and streaming music and movies ect ect. nothing important.<br /><br />so today i was thinking is it possible to just insert a usb stick with tails on it and use that as PC. its only 35 bucks and its a size of an cellphone. hang it somewhere and you can see SR on your wide screen TV. <br /><br />it was only a thought and going to try it maybe this weekend if i got the time. anyone did it ??<br /><br />if yes it would be much safer then a laptop or something like that cause no harddrive only the usb stick , and if cops come they wont even notice its a computer right? <br /><br />let me hear you thoughts about it <br /><br />Regards

				You could install Raspbian on it, which is basically Debian Linux. That you could turn into a Tor workstation, like the Xubuntu virtual machine in my tutorial. The desktop on it would be quite slow though. So you&#039;d be better off using it as a Tor router without desktop, and connecting another computer to it to use it as a gateway. E.g. some cheap Mini-ITX computer.<br /><br />

				Someone sells these, they are called Onion Pi and they&#039;re made by adafruit.<br />Here&#039;s a link:<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/onion-pi-turns-raspberry-pi-into-tor-proxy-and-wireless-access-point/

Here is a link to adafruit&#039;s website where you can order his Onion Pi pre-made for $89.95:<br /><br />[CLEARNET] http://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview<br /><br />He also sells parts individually to make one from scratch. This is a really good idea.
