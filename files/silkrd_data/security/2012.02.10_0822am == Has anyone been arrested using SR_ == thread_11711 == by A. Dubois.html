				This thought just struck me- if someone had been pinched when either buying or selling from SR, wouldn&#039;t they have been kind enough to get back on (when possible) and let everyone know what happened? Has anyone ever heard of anyone taking a fall from SR?

				I know of one vendor (the guy who turned me on to SR) who was recently arrested under mysterious circumstances.&nbsp; But he is in jail and we haven&#039;t spoke so he may have been arrested for something in the real world. Hard to say, really.

				If somebody was we likely wouldn&#039;t know as the authorities don&#039;t often disclose how they obtained intelligence. In past online busts I&#039;m aware of where intel was disclosed, the entire forum/site/what have you was taken down.

				Was wondering the very same thing just the other day. However, I&#039;m pretty damn convinced that they wouldn&#039;t go for a single vendor or buyer, but rather keep working on picking up a whole bunch of people in one big sweep.<br /><br />SR has become a point of contention with the politicians, TV coverage n all, so LE will prolly want to produce some spectacular WE BUSTED THEM ALL show rather than picking up a vendor here and there.<br /><br />Mark my words, when we go down here we&#039;ll all go, and prolly with a big media-friendly bang...

				Enelysion never got anything sent to his house. He had an international kilo of methylone intercepted and it got him put under surveillance. They seem to have staked out his fake ID box for days waiting for him to come, although they did leave a love letter in the box. I heard from someone else who talked frequently with him, that he had at least one other love letter prior to that one, but that he was almost positive he had just been scammed and a fake love letter sent. I remember somewhat him talking about this as well, but I didn&#039;t pay much attention to it and it has been so many months now that I honestly am not entirely clear on my last conversations with him. <br /><br />From the legal documents I have seen so far he may very well have been scammed with the first love letter, because it seems the methylone is what led to him being identified, I saw no mention of a prior interception. I am not sure if he kept using the box after the interception. He did have other packages already in route to it though, and they were intercepted when they got to the box. He told me he didn&#039;t think anyone was following him from the box and that he took a long route home after getting that love letter. If they got him under surveillance during the last confirmed time he went to his box when he got that last love letter, apparently they were quite sneaky about it. <br /><br />He was paranoid that people were following him taking pictures of him, but if this was shortly before or after he got the love letter I can not remember. He told me this fairly shortly before he was raided. He thought they may be private investigators hired by someone he had beef with, I kind of discounted it because the dude was always unrealistically paranoid during periods (okay okay so am I lol), but I did let him know they were more likely feds than PIs. At this point I actually told him to clean house and take his shit somewhere else for shipping, and to just handle orders and let someone else ship.<br /><br />I am still not clear if he had the drugs and press at his house or at a storage center he obtained with a fake ID. Court documents make notice of a garage in particular, it doesn&#039;t specify if it was a garage on a house or a rented garage. I think he may have kept shit at a rented storage center with fake IDs but I am not sure. I can confirm this after talking with some of his IRL friends I know online, but everyone in his circle has been laying low as fuck since this happened and I have myself not been online very much the past few months so we have all had minimal contact.<br /><br />The feds illegally placed GPS trackers on his vehicle. They followed him to some unknown degree (manned surveillance the entire time? Just GPS surveillance? Who knows) for some period of time that I can&#039;t remember even though it is in the court documents, I think it was at least a few weeks though. I will check on this again too, sorry I just can not remember how long he was being watched for. After a while they started checking some of his outgoing mail they observed him dropping in random mail boxes, and drug dogs magically hit on I think it was four outgoing packs that had nothing in them they were trained to smell. I don&#039;t know if those customers got visits by the feds or not. I do know he sent out a lot of packages in this time period though and that apparently only four of the packs were intercepted. It is worth noting that I heard a very believable rumor that he sent $50,000 CIM to a vendor in this time frame, and that vendor has been having a lot of interceptions lately. I probably should let them know, I don&#039;t think they knew him as enelysion or know that he was arrested or under surveillance, although they did apparently just pocket the money since he was arrested before they got his shipping address (keep in mind this is all hearsay...). <br /><br />The drugs they found him mailing out were apparently used to get a warrant to raid him (although honestly I don&#039;t see why they couldn&#039;t get a warrant based on mail fraud or fraud for a storage garage, he did apparently commit at least one of those crimes). I believe when they raided him he was not home but was on vacation actually, I don&#039;t know if they raided only his house or also his storage center. From what I have heard he was arrested by various federal and local agencies as he pulled into his drive way after his vacation. His computers were all encrypted although also all seized, last info I got indicates that he did not cooperate in giving them decryption keys. He is worried they might have covertly put keyloggers on them although there is no evidence to substantiate his fears (although they did covertly GPS his vehicle, and they did know he was Enelysion so maybe they did, who knows. I have good reason to believe that they did not, but I am by no means certain.). <br /><br />His girl of course essentially snitched on him, but I don&#039;t hold it against her as he was always quite clear to me that if she was facing prison time it was what he wanted her to do to save herself. He did sort of corrupt her, I guess. Anyway, it was what he wanted, although who knows if he still wants it now that it actually came to pass. She is about to have his baby and he wanted someone to be there to take care of it.<br /><br />The agents did know he was Enelysion on OVDB and they also told him in a taunting way that they were doing a name flooding attack since it was open registration. Then again they also told him that they pwnt Tor to find him and all evidence makes it seem like this is total bullshit. The investigation was started by the department of homeland security, it seems like they were actually investigating enelysion for several months but only managed to locate him when they intercepted the methylone. My guess is they were doing intensive screening of mail to box stores in that area in an attempt to find him, although maybe not since he did get a lot of packs through prior to that one being seized. Then again they had trouble finding bombs mailed by terrorists even when human intelligence indicated that there were some and the source country was known. He was stupid to be shipping out of the area he lived in and also getting international packs to the area he lived in.<br /><br />Last I I heard they were offering him 15 years if he pled guilty, although previously I had heard 30 years. I guess we will know when he is sentenced, he doesn&#039;t have a trial date yet and is still being held at a mental hospital for a psych evaluation, he had a psychotic break down shortly after he was arrested. <br /><br />Sorry if there is any incorrect information in this post, it is accurate to the best of my knowledge at this time but I do need to confirm a few things. I also get a bit of conflicting information from different sources, and my own memory is not perfect. I wish I paid better attention to him some of the times we talked, especially towards the end. <br /><br />I have really just not been very involved with online scene since this shit happened, and was very busy IRL also. These days I am happy to just help people out with security and study security and computers for my own personal benefit and projects, and my involvement with the scene outside of SR and my close circle of internet friends from years and years ago is essentially zero these days. It is actually a very relieving feeling. I wish that Enelysion made the same choice before they pwnt him. <br /><br />The lead agent on his case calls himself a leading expert in regards to the online drug trade, but he obviously doesn&#039;t know shit about it because he claimed that in his expert opinion the blue tablets they found were MDMA but anyone in the scene knows the bee tabs are 2c-b. Guess that right there shows they don&#039;t have people on any of the serious private forums since everyone knows that lol.

				Thx for the info, kmf. I would like to point out tho, that the 9th curcuit court of appeals here in the USA recently ruled that placing a GPS tracking device on a car WITHOUT a warrant is perfectly legal. They ruled this way based on the fact that if it is legal to follow him in public using regular LE, then placing the tracker was just an electronic way of doing that. The case has been appealed and is headed to the Supreme Court. So it&#039;s a great idea to change cars often if you are making deliveries. and check the ones you do use often, if changing is not possible. There have been several cases of people finding the GPS units during oil changes etc. Under the Patriot Act, there is a new (and very scary) type of warrant called the sneak and peak. They can actually go into your house when you are not there and search and add tracking software to your computer. So extremely well hidden home video surveillance is a great idea, although the alphabet boys prob have bug detectors and would find the cameras. It would be great to throw a wrench in their works tho, and make them have to deal with the video system as well as the search. It is so sad that all these new powers that have been added were done so under the auspice of terrorism, but now are being mainly used to catch drug dealers who are only engaged in voluntary exchange. I read that out of almost 1000 sneak and peak type warrants, only a handful were used to try and catch &quot;terrorists&quot; (whoever they are) and the rest were used for drug cases. I call BULLSHIT on that.
