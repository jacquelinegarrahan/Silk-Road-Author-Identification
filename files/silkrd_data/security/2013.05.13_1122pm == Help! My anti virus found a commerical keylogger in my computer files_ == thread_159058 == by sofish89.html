				Ok so long story short, I got the new Ad-Aware anti virus program and ran it on my computer to see if maybe spyware/adware/virus (or other) was the cause of my computer running so slow.<br />After the scan the results came back that it had flagged 2 things, one was low level adware threats (i belive they came from accuweather or some other weather website) and the other threat was &quot;highly flagged&quot; and was called a &quot;commercial keylogger&quot; threat. i pressed the &quot;Fix&quot; button and that was it but had a couple questions..<br /><br />1..How concerned should I be about this?<br />2.Where did this keylogger come from?<br />3.Did ad-aware get rid of it or is there more I should do?<br /><br />Is a &quot;commercial keylogger&quot; as bad as it sounds?<br /><br />

				Did you look at the location of the infected files or anything?&nbsp; There isn&#039;t really another way to tell where you got it.&nbsp; Everything you&#039;ve been typing could be compromised...&nbsp; For who knows how long you had it on there....

				Do you have any software like Radmin or PCAnywhere, Logmein or another remote control software package installed?<br /><br />Commercial key-logger usually means you have installed a retail purchased support software.<br /><br />You really should have looked closer and found out the name of the file it was pointing to, it would make it easier to trace.

				The ones you find are much less worry some than the ones you can not.&nbsp; When in doubt scrap it and start over. Either new lap top or new hard drive, gots to be safe...&nbsp; ;)

				Yes you should be more than concerned. A &quot;commercial keylogger&quot; is the type any non-technical asshole can find on the interweb and set up on your computer with a few minutes of access. Found one of these on an ex-gf&#039;s computer I was fixing one time. Turned out it was the faggot she was fucking around on me with that wanted to stalk her. Check the keylogger&#039;s config file for the ip address or email address that it reports to and then proceed to beat the shit out of him.<br /><br />at least, that was my strategy...
