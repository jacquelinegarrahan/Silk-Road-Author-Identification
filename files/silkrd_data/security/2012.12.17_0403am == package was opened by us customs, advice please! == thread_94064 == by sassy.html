				I ordered 100g of methylone from china and i received the package and it had been opened by customs. and resealed with a customs sticker. i reopened it and took the fat bag of methylone out and it had a &quot;inspected by us customs and border patrol&quot; sticker on it . should i be worried even though they didnt confiscate it? can i still use this address?

				Good question. What was the import labeled as?<br /><br />For example I got nbome pills from the UK labeled as vitamins.

				If they didn&#039;t raid your house within a few minutes of delivering the package, you&#039;re fine. They won&#039;t give you a chance to get away with it. I&#039;m also pretty sure if they planned a raid, they wouldn&#039;t put a big sticker on the package warning you about it. Perhaps methylone doesn&#039;t come as anything on field tests. They didn&#039;t know what it is, but they knew it wasn&#039;t a (known) controlled substance, so they let it go.

				I know many vendors send chemicals listed as other, inert chemicals, so maybe customs inspected it, looked at it, and gave it the all clear.<br /><br />ALSO<br /><br />I know that on the rare occasion certain chinese vendors will sometimes throw the customs shit on the package THEMSELVES to make it look more legitimate. Those packages go through lots of different people. I&#039;d put my money that the vendor themself ( or the distributer ) put that shit on themselves.

Although I have seen similar subterfuge in packaging before; ie, packages coming to me that look like they have been checked by customs already as a method of subterfuge. I don&#039;t know if that specific thing would be used, but I could see it happening.

				Don&#039;t overthink it.&nbsp; They opened the package, checked it against a list of know banned chemicals, didn&#039;t find a match and sent it on.&nbsp; If at any point they thought it was a banned substance they would have either removed the item and included a letter saying it had been seized and do you want to come down and claim it, or they would have kept the entire thing and sent you a love letter.
