				Have you looked at the exchanges (other than Gox)? They might slow the process down a bit but it seems like the one I looked at had fees that were kinda low to transfer to a bank account. I think it was this one I was looking at?: <br />https://www.campbx.com/<br /><br />Here is a big list of possibilities:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade

I read the post earlier and forgot about it, lost the tab and then never saw it again in unread posts. =/<br /><br />So, as for my paypal account, I don&#039;t know. I stopped fighting it when it became apparent that they didn&#039;t really care much, and while it wasn&#039;t chump change, it wasn&#039;t enough for more than a small claims billet. That being said, there have been many stories about PayPal freezing accounts and funds based upon their own determinations. There is no semblance of an idea as to what constitutes a true violation. They&#039;ve frozen charities!<br /><br />[Clearnet Warning]http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/paypal-freezes-regretsys-account-for-needy-children/<br /><br />This is a pretty good article outlining some of the past transgressions, it is particularly referencing a 2011 one, but the history extends to the present and as far back as paypal&#039;s inception.<br /><br />And that, is just what they&#039;ve done to charities.<br /><br />Honestly, there is a really large Aussie crowd here. I see that you specifically mention its not for illegal purposes - don&#039;t assume the advice given by people who use something for illegal means, is illegal in itself. Receiving money is not a crime, receiving money FOR illegal services is. If the service was legal, and the money received is legal, you&#039;ve nothing to worry about. Consider a new post of that kind of topic directed at Australians - how do you withdrawal into AUS?<br /><br />I wish I had that answer for you though... I don&#039;t withdrawal, for a few reasons, but mostly because its an avenue I feel adds another layer of risk.

				paypal $ucks a$$ so hard... don&#039;t do it. especially since you know about SR and might want to order something here one day.<br /><br />if&nbsp; E V E R&nbsp; a package addressed to you gets seized... <br /><br />&quot;we have an package addressed to you that contains controlled substances.&quot;<br />&quot;YOU MEAN LIKE D R U G S ?!?!? i didn&#039;t order that!!!!&quot;<br />&quot;well, okay, we can not proof that, but we have proof that you were selling / buying BTCs online. Therefore we have gotten a search warrant since you might be a vendor.&quot;<br /><br />Perfect mate. And this is just one example.<br /><br />BTC to CC is suppose to work fairly well. that way you can avoid taxes too if you want to.<br /><br />Or keep them... not sure what better investment you want to make.<br /><br />PP &lt;-&gt; BTCs&nbsp; &nbsp;Big no no no no no no
