				I don&#039;t fully understand the blockchain but I gather it&#039;s a publicly available list of BC transactions. So if I want to send BC from a seller account to a buyer account or vice versa is it necessary to do it via a third party or can I go straight ahead? Would the law know that certain BC addresses are flagged to Silk Road or do they just show up as any other number in the vast blockchain stream?<br /><br />If it&#039;s OK to do this and large sums of money are at stake I gather it&#039;s better to do small amounts at a time, yes?

				If you&#039;re sending coins to a username on SR instead of a bitcoin address, then your transaction will never hit the blockchain.<br />It will be in SR&#039;s database though until it gets removed.<br />Also unless SR is ever compromised, nobody should be able to link an address to SR.<br />They&#039;re just like any other address, however that doesn&#039;t mean that you shouldn&#039;t try to obfuscate the link between your exchange and SR.<br />Lastly there&#039;s no distinction between small or large amounts as long as you send it to the correct user. ;)

				Thanks, Duffman. Thant&#039;s a great explanation. If I could give you Karma points&nbsp; I would give you one (and some karma :)).<br /><br />Does anyone know how long internal transfer details are kept on Silk Road&#039;s servers? Is it maybe a month or two? Just long enough in case there is a dispute between users and then the details are deleted in case of a server bust by LE?<br /><br />I guess only someone from Silk Road admin would know this.
