				I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; I mean, I know why you think that, geographically it&#039;s possible...but opi never asked me to go out of escrow, none of that, always delivered...good egg, actually.&nbsp; Good dope, too...

				Tony76 has probably overdosed or been in a fatal car wreck by now. Karma is instant on that level trust me.<br /><br />Just because opi is hooked into the same canadian bikie supply line means only that.<br /><br />But I wont complain about guys having stupid theories if it means theres more acid for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Back when OPI first started selling molly he sent me a sample. It wasn&#039;t molly, it was some weird orange stuff and I didn&#039;t roll on it at all. I was frankly quite upset and OPI offered me a full refund and apologized profusely. I appreciated his efforts to fix up the mess. Thought I&#039;d throw that in there.

				i highly highly doubt opi is tony or one of his minions, even though i dont like the guy (both of them) i will give him thag<br /><br />i do lile phub, great asset to forums especially H thread and thanks for your response about FE. obviously you are free to do what you want, but might i suggest you keep your friendly FE to yourself (and the vendor) so that newer people dont get the wrong idea, or it becomes more and more commonplace.<br /><br />lastly, like i said above i do lile you and appreciate you here, so dont take this the wrong way.... but you are obsessed with tony and the huge scam. like you keep revisiting it to analyze and make sure it never happens again but its giving you PTSD or something. just forget it, forgive it if you can, the buddha way. and learn the lesson. preaching the lesson is fine but saying you do FE was a bit of a headscratcher. now you say you were one of first to see tony was gonna do a rip off scam? come on man no one saw that coming. he had been complaining and requiring FE for months and always for the sales that worked out fine. he played us all like a fiddle and you cant claim you knew it was gonna happen then at 4/20 sale.<br /><br />anyway, live and learn. never fucking FE anybody!!!! and escrow can protect you<br /><br />i recently got back 50% refund caus my vendor blatantly lied about express shipping times and wanted me to FE. well i won
