				Hi folks. Wanted to say that I love Silk Road but there&#039;s more to it then meets the eye. For one thing, You should be smart while using this site. The authorities are all over it so be really careful about what you say in the forums. <br /><br />Also, it is wise to not be on here just hanging out for hours and hours. The best thing is to take care of business and log out and then delete the tor browser and every bit of evidence from your computer although the authorities can get the info from your hard drive anyway but if they hack into your system from another computer then they wont see it. If you got usernames and passwords saved then send them to one of your email addresses and save it there. Maybe it sounds like a lot of trouble.<br /><br />FBI, DEA, and all sorts of other authorities are making up new accounts every day and monitoring the forums. Sure you are using Tor, a program that gives you a proxy ip address. Everything can be cracked or hacked in a matter of time and that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to use pgp or gpg or any kind of encryption. <br /><br />It&#039;s all about the money. The authorities in America want their hands in everything. They want to control people. <br /><br />It&#039;s smarter and more safe to buy your bit coin from a reputable vendor here on silk road. Those companies that sell it are subject to the government coming in and demanding to see who they&#039;ve sold to and they will give it up. What will you say you spent your bit coins on? Have you got tangible evidence? <br /><br />Those people who sell bit coin. They are getting them from somewhere and if they are buying from a public company then they would be wise not to be buying drugs through the mail because once it is known that they have been selling bit coin on SR, then they will be subject to their mail being watched and investigated. Well I know that you may say to use a separate seller&#039;s account to sell bit coin. It really don&#039;t matter because if the authorities knew you were selling bit coin in the SR market place then they would still probably investigate your mail. <br /><br />Anyway, happy shopping! Can&#039;t wait to make my first buy.&nbsp; Remember to use pm&#039;s for everything and get on then get off.

				Take off your tinfoil hat and relax, mate. Paranoia is useful, but too much of it will drive you crazy. 8)<br /><br />Most of us assume that everything we do here is being logged by someone we&#039;d rather didn&#039;t log it. Hence tor and encryption and bootable usb keys and free public wifi (I loves me some free public wifi). The ones who don&#039;t make that assumption will soon learn the hard way that they should have.<br /><br />But we don&#039;t need to be moody about it. Just chill. :)
