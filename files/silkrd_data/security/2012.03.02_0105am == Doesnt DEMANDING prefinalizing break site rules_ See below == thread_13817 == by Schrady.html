				Sinc ehis listings are all over $100, everyone must prefinalize. I thought that was against site rules. <br /><br />Seller:<br />VsforU<br /><br />Price:<br />à¸¿104.89<br /><br />Ships from: United States of America<br />Ships to: USA and Canada<br /><br />Description:<br />Here&#039;s the real deal folks! 100 Watson brand 853&#039;s Vicodins. Straight from my pharmacy to your home.<br /><br />Until I learn who to trust EVERYBODY making a purchase over $100 prefinalizes. Don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy it. I will work hard to gain a stellar reputation, but don&#039;t plan to get ripped off in the meantime.<br /><br />Feel free to message me a privnote if you need or want some extra security. I&#039;ll do the same if requested.<br /><br />Happy trails!

				I believe it is, but as is probably obvious, the fact that he or she is upfront about it and says if you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy it, may preclude the need for the rule to be enforced.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a pretty terrible thing personally and hate to see vendors going this direction, but- full disclosure- i also have had very successful deals with vendors on this premise of limited trust.<br /><br />If it were to be enforced perhaps some vendors wouldn&#039;t want to take the risk of being scammed and just decide not to sell. It&#039;s a very grey issue.

				I think it&#039;s pretty fucked up in general, but if you look at each category of drug there are plenty of people who don&#039;t make you so... I messaged one because I only had 3 transactions and he asked for 4 on his page to not prefinalize, he was totally chill about it and my lsd should be here tomorrow, I am so excited, lysander is the man, I believe his shit is probably really good too.&nbsp; It said 150 ug and out of everybody on the road I believe him.<br /><br />It would totally suck to buy a larger amount though and as a buyer have a possibility of getting scammed.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp;

				Silk Road should do something about this. The guy is just a scammer witing to happen. <br /><br />Big money listings, no feedback = trouble

				Early finalize is not against SR rules, direct payment is. DPR and whole community strongly suggest that you do not do it and that if you do, risk is all on your side and DPR can not protect you.<br />Especially for new vendors. But vendors still can request it and refuse service.<br /><br />Button line, early finalize is buyers choice and whole risk is on him.<br />Direct payment, total bypass of sr purchase cart is against sr rules.

				Well finalizing early isn&#039;t banned, going outside the escrow (and therefore denying SR&#039;s admin his vig) is. On another note what does this have to do with security lol?
