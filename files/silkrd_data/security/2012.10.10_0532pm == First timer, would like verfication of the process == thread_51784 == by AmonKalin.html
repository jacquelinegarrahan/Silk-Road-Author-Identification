				Okay so i&#039;m a first time buyer on SR, so you can understand my confusion and want to verify the whole process. So i&#039;m thinking of doing this:<br /><br />Bitinstant bank deposit to anonymous wallet to SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m aware that this may not be the safest method, yet i dont want to spend so much time with washing the coins. Is it safe enough though? The sites will all be accessed through tor(liberte) or a public computer. Would it be better to do a deposit to a tor email, then to the wallet, then to SR? Also what are the average wait times inbetween these steps? And also, finally, what would the total fee&#039;s be through this way?<br /><br />Also, how exactly ddo i use PGP? Do i encrypt every full message i send to a seller?

Anything with any personal info, address, anything sensitive should be encrypted, always. <br /><br />Checkout the sticky in the security subform, that has a good list of tutorial threads if you&#039;re actually having trouble getting PGP running.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Have to agree with Errl. As a vendor, it&#039;s actually kind of annoying to get encrypted messages for simple questions. I mean, we&#039;d never turn someone away because of it - we understand the value of security.. but it just isn&#039;t necessary IMO unless, as Errl mentioned, your message contains personal info of some kind.<br /><br />As far as obtaining bitcoins - Bitinstant bank deposit straight to SR is plenty safe enough. Some people are more paranoid and believe you should wash your coins first, but as soon as you send them to SR the trail back to you is gone anyway. To each their own.<br /><br />Also, as has been suggested in other threads, just use fake information when setting up your bitinstant transaction. You&#039;ll never need to verify it so... yea. Just use a Mailinator.com email address for the process.<br /><br />All said and done you could have bitcoins inside of an hour... or it could take up to 6 hours. The system really is pretty flawless so sometimes you just have to be patient. Your coins will come! :D<br />.Hades.

				Thanks for the replies guys, i&#039;m of course a little worried about this and the possibility of getting caught. But also, does anyone know what my fee&#039;s might be?

				Getting caught buying bitcoins? It&#039;s 100% legal.. and there are a bunch of legit vendors out there who take them for products/services... so not really a big deal. Going the &#039;extra mile&#039; and using false information is just a security buffer.<br /><br />As far as fees - Bitinstant&#039;s fee is typically 3.99% + $1 I believe. Then TrustCash (the company you actually make the deposit too) has a fee of like $1.90 or something. You can go setup the transaction without actually confirming anything so you can see exactly how much money you&#039;ll get in bitcoin and what it will cost you.<br />.Hades.
