			<dd class="postbody">
				I have a few bitcoin questions. I have read a bit on the forums and offer many apologies if these questions have been covered.<br /><br />I am using Liberte to connect to SR. Does the bitcoin wallet I&#039;m going to use for SR need to be set up and accessed exclusively within Liberte?<br /><br />I can meet a person soon to buy btc for cash face to face. If I understand what I&#039;ve read correct I&#039;m then &quot;good to go&quot; right? I live in an area with heavy bitcoin use so I believe I should be able to buy btc regularly.

				bbuyer76 is correct, no you do not need to use your bitcoin wallet exclusively within Liberte for SR. To make it a bit clearer for you:<br /><br />1. Someone deposits ฿ to your wallet (long sequence of letters and numbers)<br />2. After you receive the ฿, you deposit those ฿ to your SR wallet (found on your SR account page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account)<br />3. Viola - your SR account balance has increased<br /><br />It is very important that you create a copy of the wallet.dat file for your wallet and keep it in a safe location, the reason is that if you lose your wallet.dat file, you will lose all of your ฿ in that wallet.<br /><br />HTH

My version of BTC corrupted the wallet when the system crashed. I made a backup on my encrypted pen drive by chance and was luckily that I could recover it otherwise I would have been out 50 BTC.

				Thank you very much for advice. Especially the wallet.dat tip. That should be incorporated into the &quot;beginner&#039;s anonymous SR guide.&quot;<br /><br />Got a 9am appointment to buy some coin.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

Its probably the most important thing to backup yet no turtorials on here mention it.
