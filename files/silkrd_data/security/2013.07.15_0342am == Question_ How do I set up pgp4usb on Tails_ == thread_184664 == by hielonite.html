				Appreciate it Nightcrawler.<br /><br />I mean I&#039;d use the gpg that comes with Tails just don&#039;t know how to really. About as far as I got was setting up my private key. I got someone&#039;s public key off the forum and tried encrypting their message, but with no luck&nbsp; :-\

				You can export your public and private keys to a text file, then import that into the key manager in the openpgp applet...

Here&#039;s what you do. For the purposes of this explanation, I&#039;m going to assume that you have GPG4USB installed on a usb stick, in a folder labelled GPG4USB. <br /><br />Fire up Tails as normal. <br /><br />From the Tails Desktop, double-click on the icon labelled &quot;computer&quot;. <br /><br />A new window will open-up; you will see in the left-hand pane entries like: Amnesia, Desktop, File system, etc. <br /><br />Press F3 to split the right-hand pane into two.&nbsp; Click Control+h to show the hidden files. <br /><br />At this point you will see that both of them read &quot;computer&quot; <br /><br />Plug-in your stick (containing GPG4USB) into the computer, and wait a few seconds.&nbsp; A new entry will appear in the left-hand pane, representing the stick you just plugged-in. <br /><br />If it&#039;s an 8GB stick, it might read something like: &quot;8.0GB Filesystem&quot; <br /><br />Click on Desktop in the left-hand pane; the middle pane will now read, Amnesia, Desktop. <br /><br />Click on the right-most pane, to select it. <br /><br />Now click on the entry for your stick. The right-most pane will now show the contents of your usb stick.&nbsp; <br /><br />What you want to do is to drag the folder containing gpg4usb from the right-most pane to the middle pane, essentially copying it. <br /><br />You can now close out the file manager, and you should see your GPG4USB folder on your desktop. Double-click on it to open it. Double-click on start-linux to launch GPG4USB. <br /><br />NOTE CAREFULLY: <br /><br />Tails is not called Amnesic for nothing. Each time Tails is started, it essentially is a blank slate. Every time you launch Tails, you must go through the procedure outlined above to copy GPG4USB to your Tails installation.&nbsp; Similarly, if you make any changes to your GPG keyring (e.g. adding keys) you MUST copy the GPG4USB folder from where you copied it onto Tails&nbsp; back to a usb stick, or you will lose whatever keys or other information you may have added. <br /><br />Hopefully, this should be enough to get you started. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to solve this matter...<br /><br />I think with your previous post in a different thread you were able to resolve my issues with how to use the PGP system that is with Tails.<br /><br />I sent you a PM to test it out ;)

				Ya know, gpg confused the shit outta me too when I first started up.&nbsp; All the different mods/brands work the same for the most part, maybe some versions have slightly different consoles, but if you know 1 of em, then you can figure out any differentiations as to the others.&nbsp; And from my experience they are all pretty much compatible with each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read a couple of the tutorials on here, and got it downloaded, but the way I figured it out - go look up pgp or gpg on Vimeo, or Youtube.&nbsp; Shows you exactly how to do it - ya can&#039;t go wrong.

				Nightcrawler&nbsp; - appreciate the response, but someone had already responded in another thread with slightly different instructions, showing how to install on the persistent volume, and that seems to be working fine including not having to reload keys etc<br /><br />if i come across those instructions, i&#039;ll post the link here<br /><br />found it - Astor had posted these directions - i had gone online using iceweasel &amp; downloaded gpg4usb direct to my persistent volume <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.msg1342587#msg1342587<br /><br />&quot;But if you really want to use GPG4USB, you need to double click the file start_linux, not start_windows.exe.<br /><br />First it has to be made executable by right-clicking on it and Properties -&gt; Permissions and checking &quot;Allow executing file as program.&quot;
