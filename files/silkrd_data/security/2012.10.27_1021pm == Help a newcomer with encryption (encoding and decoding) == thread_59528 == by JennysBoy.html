				Good evening.<br /><br />I don&#039;t wish to waste your time, but if it&#039;s a simple explanation, or just a link to layman&#039;s terms instructions - I could also use some help with the PGP. I downloaded a package from a link on SR, expecting a simple .exe. that would encrypt a simple message (such as &quot;Name...Address...City&quot;) and spit out the code for me to pass on in the address field for purchase, but instead ended up with a &quot;Kleopatra&quot; program that has no obvious &quot;input&gt;encrpt&quot; options. Maybe I&#039;m assuming this would be easier. Can anyone tell me what the vendor codes mean? I mean, if I can put it in my cart, and send my address, what exactly are the encryption wall-of-texts at the bottom of vendors pages used for? <br /><br />Anyhow, maybe I&#039;m naive, but if I can&#039;t figure this out I&#039;m just going to roll the dice on a small, &quot;personal&quot; size order with someone and input my name and address, unencrypted, into the address field. I didn&#039;t realize how smart you had to be to get a couple hours relief with a single pill of Adderall. <br /><br />Also, if anyone&#039;s looking to be extra helpful and earn some extra-credit, I might benefit from a link explaining how to run this show from a USB drive as I have heard referenced.<br /><br />And PSS: Since bitcoins are not illegal, are there any websites I can simply just purchase the coins from electronically? I have spent all day going to bitcoin websites. Not only is it hard to know if any of it is legit, but even when I experiment with buying it, it seems I need to have the brain of a stock market trader. I just want to get this going. I&#039;ve spent nearly 2 nights of research, getting as far as getting the Tor browser, a Tor e-mail, and downloaded the PGP package, but only see the &quot;Kleopatra&quot; window which isn&#039;t really obvious what to do from there. <br /><br />Whether or not you help me out: cheers to you all.

				Sorry for the laziness and impatience, after 100% of my time working on this since last night, I have nothing left. Maybe I&#039;ll revisit this later.

				i already took the time to direct you where to get an easier program<br /><br />plus i explained pgp briefly and where there was a tutorial<br /><br />i tell you to READ the forums and you just go post another thread asking for someone to spoon feed you again??<br /><br />no one should help you any further, you have already been directed to the appropriate resources but you want someone to hold your hand <br /><br />everyone here figured it out, either do some work on your own and understand how to stay safe or you can order and risk your safety

				Sorry dudes, apologies all around. Just exhausted from all the tech savvy from 0 to 60. The thing I downloaded was &quot;Gpg4win&quot; - perhaps it didn&#039;t come from SR - I don&#039;t know anything anymore.<br /><br />I&#039;ll revisit this later after I get recharged and take a break for a few days-weeks. <br /><br />Again, sorry guys.

				hey Jennysboy...<br />there&#039;s a SUPER easy program you should try...it&#039;s called gpg4usb.&nbsp; it can run off a usb flash drive, and it&#039;s by far the simplest pgp program i&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; Give that one a shot, and feel free to shoot me a pm if you need some help.
