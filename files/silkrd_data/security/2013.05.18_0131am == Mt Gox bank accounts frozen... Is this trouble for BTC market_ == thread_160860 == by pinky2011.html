				Hey all. So i was reading some news on google and saw that DHS froze all/some strategic accounts on MtGox. Not 100% sure what the deal is yet or the implications and how far they reach. I want to make a deposit and I usually use Bitinstant to email option. I&#039;m a little wigged out with this freeze because idk if that will affect zipzap&#039;s ability to pay me my coin. <br /><br />Have ya&#039;ll been doing successful btc-email deposits over the past 24 hours with bitinstant?<br /><br />Please put my mind at ease!!!<br /><br />Thanks much and peace,<br /><br />Pinks

				This has nothing to do with Bitinstant .... the account(s) were seized because they weren&#039;t registered with Fincen as a MSB and didn&#039;t notify Wells Fargo about their MSB activity either.

				Well so long as peeps have been getting their bitinstant deposits I&#039;m cool. I was thinking perhaps zipzap acquired their coin through MtGox and perhaps they were affected by the seizures. That was my #1 worry. Just because MtGox handles so much traffic and I don&#039;t really know where ipzap gets the coin when they send to the customer.<br /><br />Thanks for the info, though.<br /><br />Cheers

				I don&#039;t know why people continue to use Mt. Gox, which has already frozen a bunch of accounts of SR buyers and sellers because they had the nerve to access the exchange using Tor. I recommend using cash and carry to meet people locally to exchange for BTC. But if you must, use Bitinstant or someone else to convert dollars to BTC- and then deposit the BTC directly into a secure Blockchain wallet, or a wallet on your own (secure) computer. If they&#039;re sitting right there on your computer then there&#039;s no way for anyone to freeze your funds, even if Bitcoin is completely banned.
