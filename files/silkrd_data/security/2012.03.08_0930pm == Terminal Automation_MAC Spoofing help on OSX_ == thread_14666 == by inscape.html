				so for whatever reason it&#039;s been years since i&#039;ve been able to get MacDaddy or ChangMac to work on multiple macbooks/os&#039;s. and they are the only to programs i know for OSX that claim to spoof your MAC addy. the next best option i know is to type in terminal:<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether<br /><br />(to get your current MAC addy)<br /><br />sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z<br /><br />(where you must type in your admin password)<br /><br />sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:11:62:73:24:59<br /><br />(to select/change your MAC addy)<br /><br />ifconfig en1 | grep ether<br /><br />(to verify your new addy)<br /><br />-----<br /><br />only problem is you gotta type each command separately, manually change your mac addy,&nbsp; along with your admin pass each time you log in. i&#039;ve looked into automating terminal, ect. and it&#039;s doable, but it seems it would take a decent amount of time to learn. although im not above learning it myself, i just thought perhaps someone already in the know about these things could perhaps recommend some easy way to perhaps tie these commands together so i could maybe copy/paste one single block of code each time when i log in? which would of course leave me the option to manually change may MAC addy at will before pasting.<br /><br />would it be very difficult to perhaps even throw these few commands together with a basic gui? there seems to be a void for a simple easy to use MAC spoofer for mac users atm. would be nice to be able to just set it as a login-item, like i used to do with macdaddy, ect....<br /><br />any thoughtz?<br /><br />thanks..

				Why not edit your sudoers file so that the ifconfig and airport commands can be executed by your normal user (as root) without entering a password and just creating a bash script?<br /><br />
