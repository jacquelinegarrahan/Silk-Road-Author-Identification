				Title: <strong>Question About F/E</strong><br />

				Hello!<br /><br />I am new to the silk road, and I was interested in purchasing an item from an international vendor, who requires F/E from non-domestic buyers. This is a reputable vendor with many positive reviews, but I was wondering- does finalizing early truly prevent all courses of action for the buyer if the package does not arrive, or is it possible to escalate and for SR to get coins back?<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

				No. If you fe &#039;SR Support&#039; cannot help you as you&#039;ve done the deal outside of their escrow system. Stay in fe stay safe, outside of fe it&#039;s your risk.<br />

				Many people will tell you NOT to FE. I&#039;ll be one of those people. As princess said, if you FE, it&#039;s at your own risk. You won&#039;t be getting any money back if you get scammed.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are some legit vendors out there who do FE, but there&#039;s also other legit Vendors who work within the escrow system. I, and almost every other buyer, will recommend finding a vendor working in escrow because in the long run, it&#039;s not worth it to FE.

				I just know (as I&#039;ve never made any purchases before) that it will be hard to find a vendor who will accept escrow at this time (especially for the prices I want). Also, the guy I&#039;m looking at has a 100 feedback rating, and a lot of positive feedback on SR and these forums. If this is true, I&#039;m probably fine, right? I wouldn&#039;t F/E for any vendor who didn&#039;t have consistent feedback. Thanks for the responses by the way guys! I appreciate you helping a newbie out!

I&#039;m still going to tell you not to FE, but if you must, then make sure the vendor is established too because vendors sometimes fake ratings by buying their own product. <br /><br />Just make sure you&#039;re comfortable with releasing the money I guess.

				Alright, thanks for the advice! I&#039;ll definitely look around a little more and try to find an escrow option before I go through with this.
