				For whatever reason one might have for becoming anonymous whether it is debt, legal reasons or just wanting to start all over, it seems as though with Tor, SR and BTC it isn&#039;t all that hard to do. If you can make a substantial income from SilkRoad, you can exchange your bitcoins to basically anything e.g/ cash in the mail, supermarket giftcards, clothing giftcards and even prescription medication that you&#039;d usually need healthcare for. <br /><br />Of course you would have to give up some luxuries e.g driving, welfare support and a stable job. But if you&#039;re in a big city public transport is everywhere and it&#039;s pretty easy these days to get cash in hand jobs. There&#039;s also plenty of landlords that will happily rent to you as long as you can provide some sort of fake ID and a decent bond and cash advance.<br /><br />It is something I am considering doing in the very near future and I&#039;d like to hear some other opinions on this. Do you think it can be done? Can I leave my old life behind and create a new identity?<br /><br />

				Sounds interesting, but once you log onto a computer I think you&#039;re fucked. There&#039;s so much surveillance and cameras everywhere.&nbsp; Sounds like a fun idea though.&nbsp;

				I actually offer one way to be absolutely anonymous in the real life:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6c5dd40676<br /><br />In the guide I also offer a way to be anonymous digitally, especially with online monetary transactions, where you can be anyone, anywhere, regarding to the billing address checkups.<br /><br />I also offer in the guide&#039;s annex how to get a 4 years college degree in only 1, and some extra information to build up a new profile to your new identity.<br /><br />To keep anonymity in the internet, you must use TOR. To counter any inherent TOR vulnerability, you can simply use VPN+TOR.<br />Also, NEVER enable JAVA, FLASH, not even JAVASCRIPT. Flush Cookies in every session.

				I think it&#039;s definitely possible, change your hair style/color, use eye contacts to change your eye color, if you have pale skin go to a solarium, if your thin, put on weight vice versa. Live in a big city, live in a share house, where they&#039;ve already set up an internet connection under their name.<br /><br />Peach, I had a look at your item and I&#039;m tempted to buy but I live in Australia will the information be relevant?<br /><br />

				- think twice the next time you fill out a form for any library, government, local council/city hall as its data being inputted somewhere.<br /><br />- run everything on pay-as-you-go, where possible...if not....then its hardly anonymous is it....<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br />

				i dont think it would be hard but it would take discipline to do that for the rest of your life <br /><br />peach i dont want to rain on your goods but all that information can be found through here and a good amount of time spent browsing the rest of the darkweb with a little smarts and ingenuity <br /><br />the only thing I would see going wrong is what if SR were to be taken down? What would you do, obviously the site going down will have a big effect on bitcoins economy so even if you had a bunch saved up im sure with SR gone it would be way less than what it was<br /><br />ive read about many other online sites enabling illegal activity all usually with a shelf life of 2 years SR has been around for 1 and change, seems like there would be to much banking on the longevity of SR but if it does last obviously it can be done and I wouldnt doubt that there are people out there doing it now

				I agree completely with what was said previously. Being completely anonymous on the internet is pretty damn near impossible as with the US patriot act they have the ability to monitor any communications with or without a warrant.<br /><br />The good news is the government doesn&#039;t have the monetary capabilities as well as jurisdiction to build cases based solely on communications done over tor or any propiertary network. Rest assured these communications are safe from reprocussions however the caveat is if you communicate regarding your activities outside of the tor network you open the door for legal rammifications.<br /><br />If you are selling drugs then make sure your associates are clear of any involvement or informing to law enforcement. <br /><br />

				Unfortunately the guide has been tailored to the US bureaucracy.<br />But anyone who is physically present in the US could pull it off, have a vacation here and go back with a US passport in hand... currently the USA is a great country to do some identity shopping without stealing! lol<br />Every country has different laws and regulations, every country is a different creature.<br /><br />@Mistersketch I&#039;ve spent years researching it, and so far I&#039;ve been laughing at anyone who claimed to be able to get new genuine identities... especially when they are just fantasies of kids who never in their lives seem to have left their mom&#039;s basements. Being able to tell apart the bullshit from the real shit is what people seem to be lacking, and while two different methods might seem effective at first glance, being able to tell from shortsighted plans from the well-rounded ones comes only through deep knowledge of the inner workings of the system and through experience.<br /><br />As I said, what I ultimately offer is peace of mind: shit that works, period. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been receiving many requests from Aussies, I&#039;ll see if I can research anything but it is extremely time consuming, it costs time and money, and I&#039;ll need at least a year to analyze another country&#039;s loopholes... and I must test it myself personally to confirm that it works.<br />If anyone is interested to fund the costs of this research venture I&#039;ll be more than happy to help you guys.

				If SR gets shut down I have no doubt it will be back up in no time or a similar site will take off. SR has a monopoly, and the owner is making millions. If it closes it&#039;s door, there&#039;s gonna be a lot of motherfuckers wanting to fill that void.

				hahah peach dont take it so offensively, I have said nothing about me knowing how to attain a genuine passport ive had a few ideas and im sure they would work that id be willing to share but if people are lazy enough to pay 100 dollars for something they can find for free searching the deepweb more power to you maybe your raise in price to something retarded in the near future will bring in more people...&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been really curious for the last few hours about this guide peach. Going to wait and see for a few more reviews before I purchase it. But it sounds like the best read of my life. Something that potentially ANYONE could need to use one day. Any mention in there about being in AFIS already?

				@Mistersketch<br />Let me know in private your ideas and I will tell you if it will work or if it will fail.<br />I know exactly how the passport office works in the US, and how and what states are directly connected with the SSA in real time, and which states are processing validations in batches.<br /><br />The question is not having &quot;an idea&quot;, but actually KNOWING what happens if you apply that idea.<br />Here, in writing, it may feel to be insignificant detail, but in real life it&#039;s all the difference what will keep you out of jail.<br /><br />You must learn the difference between speculating and knowing.<br />That&#039;s the tiny difference that differentiates an amateur from a professional.<br />A true professional doesn&#039;t offer goods or services anymore. <br />The true professional offers peace of mind through assurance, because he KNOWS.<br /><br />Adolescents are too proudly focused on the power of deduction, and they simply can&#039;t comprehend the essential value of experience, simply because they have none.<br />That&#039;s how I detect teenagers, they can&#039;t comprehend the sterility of ideas without empiricism.<br />Cheers
