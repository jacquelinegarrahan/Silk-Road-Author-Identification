				As many of you know, anonymous cash deposits through banks just became impossible. So I&#039;m wondering, if you use a fake name and cell number and everything at these Moneygram locations, do they actually check? Or can you use a fake name every time and be good to go?

				I only have experience with MoneyGram at CVS. Sometimes they ask, sometimes they don&#039;t. When they do ask, it&#039;s usually from an employee who hasn&#039;t seen me yet, and ID is only to verify that you&#039;re paying for the right transaction. On their screen they just see a list of MoneyGram transactions going on at their specific location and want to make sure you&#039;re not paying for another person&#039;s shit. If they ask for ID, just make up some excuse and tell them the full name of the fake name you used. Depending on how the day is going for that employee, they&#039;ll either cut you slack or be a douche bag. In the case of them being douche bags, just tell them you&#039;re not interested and leave. Go back when someone else is working or go to a different location.<br /><br />If it becomes an issue for you, just order some fake ID on the SR to use.

				No they do not, unless your making a payment of over 900$ I believe, then they start asking you for ss# and a bunch of other info. Just put down a fake name, address, and phone number and you&#039;ll be fine. If in the event that they do ask you (even though they most likely won&#039;t), then just make up some backstory about why you don&#039;t have an i.d.&nbsp; But in all honesty, your fine, most of the people who work at walmart could probably care less about some person paying for a moneygram, they have multiple customers everyday doing&nbsp; the same thing you are.

				Walmart does ask for a phone #, simply for their own tracking.&nbsp; Supposedly, they use that info to track their customers repeat business so I be sure to use a different # each time.&nbsp; They ask if I&#039;ve used the service before (no) and give a live residential address in the area verified by many web sites that provide address verification.&nbsp; Then I just make up a phone number with the proper local exchange.&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s possible you could give them a fake phone # which was previously used by someone else, but just say &quot;must been one of the kids&quot;.&nbsp; They have never asked for ID.&nbsp; My experience with CVS is either they don&#039;t know how to do it, or they ask for ID, or both.&nbsp; Of course, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I just used Bitinstant to Moneygram/Walmart (clearnet), take cash to Walmart, to MtGox (also clearnet), to Instawallet (darknet, anonymous), to SR.&nbsp; Took maybe a few hours start to finish.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even pay the BTC .0005 to MtGox for &quot;expedited&quot; service and they sent it within 20 mins.

				I&#039;ve used moneygram via Walmart once, about a month ago.&nbsp; I filled out the blue form with bullshit info, and handed it to the lady behind the counter.&nbsp; She took a minute to input it all or whatever, and then asked for the cash.&nbsp; It took about 3 minutes, and never needed ID.<br /><br />Although, I&#039;ve had the same experience in the past with a check cashing place, but they have just recently been asking for ID.&nbsp; Things are definitely getting tighter.

				I have heard several different experiences with Wal-mart that indicate that no ID is REQUIRED. While they may ASK if you have an ID, if you indicate that you don&#039;t have it with you, then they will not actually require it. Simply give them a bogus address and phone number, and you are good to go!

				In my experience they don&#039;t seem to care at all. Nothing out of the ordinary, don&#039;t sweat it. Use all the fake names you want.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t give them a Po box address as they wont accept.

				I&#039;ve used them a couple of times and they&#039;ve never asked for ID.<br /><br />However make sure to use a different phone number each time because if you use the same one with multiple transactions they will see you&#039;re using different names. Explain that shit away.
