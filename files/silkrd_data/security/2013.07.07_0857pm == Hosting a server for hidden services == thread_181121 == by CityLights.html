				I&#039;ve been studying Tor for some time now and am considering building my own hidden service and eventually hosting hidden services for others. Does anybody have any experience with this?

				There is a free service that already offers this and it&#039;s called Freedom Hosting.&nbsp; You will end up with CP on your server you&#039;re hosting for others.

Besides server misconfiguration and hacking / rooting the server, if you are running PHP or other scripting languages, malicious scripts could connect over clearnet to an attacker&#039;s server to reveal your IP. The safest configuration is this:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=100998.0<br /><br />But that&#039;s too expensive for the vast majority of hidden services. A better alternative is to use VMs or jails to isolate the web server and the Tor client, and route everything from the web server VM through the Tor VM, for example, so even if the server is pwned, the attacker won&#039;t find your IP (at least not easily).<br /><br />Another option is to rent the server anonymously and make frequent backups. This is the &quot;disposable server&quot; option, where you simply drop the server and redeploy elsewhere if it is pwned. :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was planning on going with Apache running on linux for the server unless anyone can recommend a better alternative.

				Some other points.<br /><br />If you&#039;re really worried about the hidden service being identified, you should NOT run it on a VPS. Get a dedicated server. You can find low end dedis for under $50 a month these days, which should be enough to get started. Make sure you remove any backdoors, like ssh keys that the provider puts in root&#039;s authorized_keys file.<br /><br />Use full disk encryption. You will have to request this feature if the provider doesn&#039;t have a way for you to load installation images and install the OS yourself.<br /><br />Never connect to the hidden service directly. Create a separate hidden service for ssh and enable the HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient option in stealth mode.<br /><br />Rent the server anonymously, whether or not it&#039;s disposable. The vast majority of providers don&#039;t take bitcoins, so you&#039;ll have to anonymize fiat currency. I haven&#039;t done that for years and the most popular method back then, Liberty Reserve, is gone, so you&#039;ll have to find other ways of bouncing your money through exchanges. Other people are more knowledgeable than me about that and can probably consult you in private.<br /><br />And if all this is too much, then like Jack said, just get an FH invite. :)

If you do that it prevents all IP leaks and DNS leaks, and it also makes it a lot harder for hackers to obtain your real IP address even if they manage to root the VM with the web server in it. I consider this technique to be absolutely indispensable, especially for hidden services. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Generally, the simpler the application, in this case the web server software, the smaller the attack surface.

You can still use exchangers to cash out Bitcoin to bank wires and such probably, although it has been a while since I bought a server anonymously, and since LR is gone and a lot of exchangers have been busted it might be harder these days. It was already a pain in the ass even before they busted LR, since people renting dedicated servers generally have various anti fraud systems in place that are hard to get around while maintaining your anonymity. I am sure you can still get dedicated servers anonymously, it is just a bit of work and probably even more so now than it ever has been before. <br /><br />There are a lot of other things to take into consideration as well. I mean, for the absolute ultimately secured hidden service I could write a book on the subject, but pretty much nobody goes to all of the trouble and expense required to make a hidden service as secure as humanly possible. Some steps are totally indispensable though, like running the web server isolated in a VM that doesn&#039;t know your external IP address. Check the securing hidden services thread that Astor linked to as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Also it is worthwhile to mention that Jack N Hoff is correct. Your server will end up consisting of 95% child pornography sites, and it will quite likely be a high priority target of federal police and Interpol. If you don&#039;t want to host child porn you should think of a different idea for your hidden service. On the other hand, if you truly support freedom of speech, then it isn&#039;t the worst idea in the world. Just realize that you will really seriously be putting yourself at risk of going to prison for child porn distribution, just like the admin of Freedom Hosting is at risk. Freedom Hosting originally used a strategy of pretending to be completely oblivious to any of the content they host, but even that defense mechanism is probably worthless since everybody knows they are used extensively by CP sites. I think they have had like 50 different CP sites hosted by them, single ones of which have been considered some of the largest in the world.

				I&#039;d rather host everything from home, at least in the early stages while I&#039;m still learning. If I could keep everything at home long term, that would be nice, but I wouldn&#039;t mind paying for space in a datacenter if my service took off. Is my ISP likely to notice anything? I&#039;d be starting off with completely legitimate content but I want to perfect the setup as much as practically possible so that I could graduate on to other things- not child pornography, for the record. I could get another machine to act as a gateway if that would be more secure, but what makes two separate computers better than one computer with two virtual machines? I&#039;ll run Nginx and hardened Gentoo and route through Tor twice like the Securing Hidden Services thread discussed. I&#039;m hoping to learn how to do this myself instead of relying on Freedom Hosting. Thank you all for the responses.
