				<br />Time to move away from MtGox. Their terms are getting scarier by the day.<br /><br />I see consistently low priced bitcoins at btc-e.com<br />Also, no limits, no ID, and near 0 commissions.<br /><br />any other suggestion for a good site that doesnt ever ask for ID etc and has plenty liquidity?<br /><br />1g of the best mdma free to the one who can most convincingly point to a better site.<br />will give it in a week, by popular vote ;)<br />

				I love bitcoin-otc.com its basically just an irc chat with people that want to trade coins. You throw out a public message that you want to buy coins then you go into a private chat with whoever wants to o the exchange with you. There&#039;s a &quot;web of trust&quot; system where you can check a persons transaction history with positive/negative feedback and how long they&#039;ve been a member. I&#039;ve used it to exchange MP before, but I bet there&#039;s someone on there that will take whatever payment form you want. It wasn&#039;t the ABSOLUTE cheapest for me(a complete noob with no transaction history and needing instructions on how things worked), but the prices were more than reasonable ($5.00 when the mtgox price was $4.87) and the only info I gave was a random username that I won&#039;t use again and an instawallet address. Its totally anonymous because if you don&#039;t have an actual account there&#039;s no transaction logging(just be careful with who you deal with for obvious reasons) and no way to associate you with the coins you receive. There&#039;s even a tor only chat channel that I didn&#039;t mess with.

				I heard somewhere on these forums today that intersango is supporting the anti-SR movement, so if they suspect your using them to buy here I wouldn&#039;t expect them to keep you anonymous.

				depends on where you are based. i recently used bitcoin.de, they&#039;ll only let you buy 5 bitcoins until you got a positive status (which you get if the first transaction didn&#039;t have any problems). you can pay with LR, MB and bank transfer (depending on where you live you can pay the transfer cash and stay anonymous).

				Hey SKKY - I really really really want that 1g :) :) :)<br />https://bitnz.com/ is a very easy to use, A flat 0.5% commission on trades. with what I would described as either under-supplied or oversupplied at times, meaning if buying or selling at the right time, you would get good prices. <br /><br />This is a market that more people need to exploit! Would be great for a trader to SELL btc as prices are higher than the average mtgox price. For over a month, i&#039;ve paid an average price of US$5.65! And I only buy when prices are low-ish.<br /><br />Not sure if one can deposit from international bank account, but think you could.<br />Withdrawls are charged 0.005btc.

				IMHO, get-bitcoin.com works best. Guaranteed 24 hour turn around time for BTC in your account or their transaction fee (3-5%) is FREE. Easy, anonymous, and you make your max price per BTC. <br /><br />I have used market trends/mtgox trading rates to choose my own price and have never been let down. <br /><br />I highly recommend this site. Also, amazing customer service. I receive responses whenever there is an issue. <br /><br />Cheers, SKYY!&nbsp; 8)

				Another one for Get-Bitcoin. Quickest and most hassle free of getting your BTC same day, and you get the most BTC for your money. Might be a bit harder to bounce around the BTC with what happened to instawallet, but it&#039;s still worth it.<br /><br />Thanks SKYY, would love to try some of your MDMA soon.&nbsp; :)
