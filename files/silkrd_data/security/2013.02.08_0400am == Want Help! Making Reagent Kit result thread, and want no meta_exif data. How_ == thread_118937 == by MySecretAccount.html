				So, just to give context - I&#039;m a retired road warrior, but - I have a large amount of photos of reagent kit results (Marquis, LSD NIK-D), and I was talking with another person about starting a reagent-test only thread. I&#039;m planning on passing on my photos, but - I&#039;ve read of several ways to upload them without metadata, and I don&#039;t want to do so until I&#039;m 100% sure that the pictures contain nothing in them attaching me to anything. I know everybody has a different method, so my planned route is the following:<br /><br />1. On a shitty laptop that has no Wifi, take picture form SD Card, open it/resize it in paint (some are on a mega-camera in Macro mode, so zooming/cropping will be needed), then, when it&#039;s properly within view, hit Print Screen. <br /><br />2. Paste the screenshot in to a new image program, and then cut out the portion needed. close that document, do not save. <br /><br />3. Make new image, paste the cut portion in, and save that file as the image to be used. <br /><br />4. Go online (or preferably use an offline program that is absolutely solid at stripping metadata/exif info) and strip the photo of all meta/exif data reminaing. <br /><br />5. Put picture on an unused SD card, and then go to a public computer. Upload to any free imagehost under a brainwallet/cipher system so it can be found if the link isn&#039;t saved.<br /><br />6. Give that link to other person, or upload the file and tell them how to search for it. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sure this is overly paranoid, but - while I&#039;m not in the game of being a customer anymore, I&#039;m a harm reduction advocate, and really don&#039;t want some metadata from a picture to link me to the site. The reagent reports are definitely valuable, and if everyone contributed, we could have a thread similar to the LSD Avengers or other quality threads, but simply just keep it to &quot;Reagent Test of substance MDMA/LSD/whatever, specific product X, bought in Y month, from Vendor Z&quot; and then the picture. <br /><br />Not that I hate chatting, but - it&#039;s the most effective way to search for it. That way, people can easily navigate to marked pictures that show actual reagent results (the photo will have to contain some evidence of what it&#039;s claiming to be), and chat about stuff in other threads. <br /><br />EXAMPLE POST<br /><br />****************************<br /><br />Reagent Kit Test using Ehrlicht NIK-D LSD, Camel Blotters advertised at X dose, purchased in December, from Vendor MySecretAccount&quot; <br /><br />(picture)<br /><br />****************************<br /><br />So....vendors/security people....how do you strip the data to the point of being confident that it&#039;s not traceable to you? Also, any suggestions for either picture requirements? I already think Product visible, a typed or handwritten note saying &quot;MSA Camel Blotter posted 2.7.13&quot; in the picture is a must. But - when it comes to metadata, I&#039;m pretty much totally new. How would the best of you go about what I&#039;m aiming for? Is there a trustworthy method of cleaning out the data and uploading? I&#039;ve seen both a few programs, along with a website that claims to do it for you, but on the clearnet. Proxy upload of the picture would be a must too I&#039;d think. <br /><br />The possibility of also showing certain examples of not entire packages, but potential flaws or close-ups of poorly stealthified items too (vendor would be left out, maybe PGP PM to poster for details if needed. Example...a package I got once had been hole punched, which I assume was in an effort to sniff it before passing it through. A picture of that (and knowing that if you get it, your pack shouldn&#039;t be opened for a bit) is good info everybody here should <br /><br />Thoughts? Recommendations? Ideas? Suggestions for thread content? I&#039;m all ears (eyes technically)......I had my fun here, and now am just trying to make sure that people stay safe and make sure they know what they&#039;re ingesting. One RC or bunk product might be the difference between a great time and a horrible trip.

				You have got it all figured there as far as I know. In fact that may be overkill, but i absolutely understand your worries. <br /><br />Im totally on board with this thread, and when it comes about I will load up on tests to contribute. Im an avid L buyer, and take harm reduction on the Road very seriously as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				you can just hit the print screen button, take a screenshot of the open image, then cut out the part you want and paste it into a new image and then save the new image.

				That&#039;s completely OTT, it doesn&#039;t make you any safer, it just wastes time. It&#039;s not even FUD inspired, there&#039;s no given reason for doing almost any of that.<br /><br />Take photo, copy to computer, edit, strip exif data with tool x/y/z, upload via Tor. Done.
