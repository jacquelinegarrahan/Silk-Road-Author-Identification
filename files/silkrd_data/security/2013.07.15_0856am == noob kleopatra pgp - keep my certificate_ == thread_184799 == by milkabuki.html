				There&#039;s no reason you should not keep your PGP key.&nbsp; Especially if you post it in the forum and you do much encrypted communicating with various people.&nbsp; Anyone you communicate with who uses your public key will have imported it to their virtual keyring and if you keep changing it, the people you communicate with will get pretty tired of that.&nbsp; As well as it would be a nuisance for you too.<br /><br />I get what you&#039;re saying about not wanting to leave obvious traces on your computer of having been to SR, but I&#039;ve not read the particular tutorial you mention, but the sample email address they gave, was just to point out that you want to use a fake email address.&nbsp; ANY fake email address.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually a good idea to use your username just so that the person who sees your certificate sees the same user name that they associate with you... but as for the rest, you can use something as simple as say,&nbsp; &nbsp;username@fakemail.tor......&nbsp; &nbsp; or&nbsp; &nbsp; username@anonmail.biz....&nbsp; &nbsp;or&nbsp; anything you happen to think of that is in the format of a real email address, but that does not really exist.<br /><br />Another thing to remember....&nbsp; NEVER upload your certificates to any directory as you will find to be an &quot;option&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an option here.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want it uploaded to the clearnet period.&nbsp; It will totally compromise your anonyminity.<br /><br />Hope that was of some help anyway.....

				I think I understand. Since I only made my first transaction I think it&#039;d be alright to make a new certificate with a more inconspicuous fake email and stick with that.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice as well as the last tip, really appreciate it man.
