				I&#039;m trying to turn $2800 into bitcoin. Bitinstant has always been my way of getting bitcoin, but there&#039;s a limit of $500 per transaction, and the 3.99% exchange fee will mean I loose $120 just to get my bitcoin.<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way for me to do this? I want to convert the money all at once at a decent exchange rate. Doing it anonymously is preferable, but not super important.

				I feel like bitfloor is recommended a lot here, as are bitcopia and blue sky traders.&nbsp; Do realize, however, that almost every exchange is going to charge you a fee.

				You might have to drive a little bit, but have you tried looking up local sellers? That could be an easy cash transaction with no fees.

				if you use bitfloor you will lose money when sending to SR due to having to buy each coin at a few dollars higher than the average silk road uses, whereas if you use bitinstant it buys the coins at the weighted average and so your SR account goes up by the 500-fees. bitfloor is only good if the price of the coins there is at most a dollar over the mtgox weighted average

				Use Bitfloor, then send the coins to BitCoin Fog, and have them deposit to SR incrementally over the course of 72 hours, from different addresses.&nbsp; Just sayin&#039;..

				No it doesn&#039;t, sleepyeyes2k2.&nbsp; Bitcoin has such a large transaction volume that such a feature is not necessary.&nbsp; On a much smaller site, like Bitcoin Fog, it is necessary.&nbsp; You could manually break up your transactions if you&#039;re paranoid.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

You send coins to an address, blockchain.info subtracts 0.5%, and 5-30 minutes later, two deposits are made to another address. Technically there is no taint between them, but if an attacker was trying to find the source of funding and worked his way back to an address that had two deposits made to it, usually something like 3.213261 and 6.73674, which adds up to a rounder number, in this case 9.95, then he could look for transactions preceding this within a certain time frame in the block chain, and if he sees a number that&#039;s exactly 0.5% more, in this case 10.0 BTC, well there it is.<br /><br />Bitcoin Fog&#039;s implementation seems safer, because the fee is randomized, and you can specify a variable number of addresses to withdraw to and the amount of time to do it in. You can wait 7 days and withdraw to 5 addresses over 24 hours, for example. It&#039;s much harder to track that down, as long as you don&#039;t consolidate the coins again.<br />

				Yes that&#039;s certainly possible.&nbsp; It would be a bitch but it&#039;s possible.&nbsp; That&#039;s solved by leaving a few coins in for one transaction, then sending those along with 100% of new coins for your second transaction (days later).<br /><br />Certainly Bitcoin Fog is a more comprehensive and thorough mixing service.&nbsp; I feel, however, that Shared Send is good enough, and I don&#039;t lose as much.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				i&#039;ve put about 11k through bluesky.. If they tell you they can fill your order.. rest assured that it will happen.<br /><br />take your chances with a smaller amount of your still concerned. <br /><br />you can remain anon with wu as long as you make the transactions below 1k. however finding multiple wu places is usually not an issue. The fee&#039;s do get you with large amounts tho..<br /><br />im noticing staying anonymous an getting charged anythings less then 5% does not seem possible with what is offered around here.
