				What is the cheapest way to get bitcoins? im in California. get-bitcoins.com website isnt working, I heard you could just drop money into a Chase bank account. Is there any similar methods like this where I can walk into a bank, deposit cash and then receive bitcoins in my account to use here?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				There&#039;s a vendor on SR that takes Chase cash deposits with no fees. I forgot the name but he&#039;s an exchanger, you&#039;ll probably find him if you search SR.

				You can find lots of info here in the forums. There are quite a few threads with steps listed, one of which is from me. Before I did anything at all I read the forums for a couple hours every day and found that there are lots of different methods, different security techniques, different websites to use.. all have their own advantages and disadvantages.. So I think its best to do alot of reading before you start.... Don&#039;t just jump in and go for the 1st method you read about. It&#039;s important to make an INFORMED decision that will be the safest for you and your situation. Don&#039;t get impatient and make a mistake that might come back to bite you.. or put you in jail. Be smart and be safe!

				I agree with what Wonderland said. Take your time, do your research and then choose which method works best for you. Another option for direct bank deposits is bitinstant.com.&nbsp; They charge a 4.5 percent to 5% fee. You can deposit at Chase Bank, but the coins don&#039;t go to your SR wallet. They send you a redeemable code for use on MtGox (BTC exchange) , but you can use other exchanges as well. Just another option for deposits. I still would recommend reading up on options and choosing which one is best for you. <br /><br />As a sidenote, nothing against the BTC vendors, but you will definitely pay more through them than you would just taking the time to get the coins for yourself. Then again, I guess you are paying for the convienience of doing nothing?

There are some regular vendors who exchange without a fee as it&#039;s the cheapest way for them to liquidate. Or do you think they shouldn&#039;t be trusted? I&#039;m trying to make an exchange deal with a vendor (not an exchanger) who doesn&#039;t charge a fee, but reading this has given me second thoughts.

				Buying from a vendor who is trying to liquidate their BTC is different. They may or may not charge any fees and they will probably give you a fair price. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much. Make sure it is a reputable vendor tho. <br /><br />As for the exchangers who don&#039;t charge fees. From what I&#039;ve noticed, if they don&#039;t charge fees, then their price per BTC is a bit higher than market value. Keep in mind they wouldn&#039;t be providing this service if they didn&#039;t stand to make some kind of profit. I still think that, while it might take a bit longer, and be more of a process, its cheaper to just get your BTC yourself through an exchange or even get-bitcoin as some people have said. I was going to use a BTC vendor, explained to him what I wanted and he actually was nice enough to tell me that it would be cheaper for me to use the exchange and get my own coins. I thought that was awesome. So that&#039;s exactly what I did.
