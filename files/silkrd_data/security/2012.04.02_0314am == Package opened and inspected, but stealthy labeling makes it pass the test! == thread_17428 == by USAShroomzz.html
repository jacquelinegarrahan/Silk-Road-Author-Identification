				I recently sold a whole chocolate bar to a client in NY.&nbsp; The bar is well foil wrapped and have a stealthy county-themed label.&nbsp; Here is what they said:<br /><br />&quot;I checked out the package today and it seems that it was opened and examined. The foil was really rough, almost as though it had been wrapped/unwrapped/wrapped by an inspector. The package had been placed into another envelope because they had sliced the side of the envelope down the side. It is a testament the candy bar disguise that even though it seems to have been examined, it still made it through... even though I am freaking out and looking over my shoulder constantly.&quot;<br /><br />SO, vendors beware that they are inspecting a package here and there.&nbsp; There was nothing on the outside of the package that I can think of that would have made it a target.&nbsp; It had a printed, professional looking shipping label and DCN.&nbsp; My thoughts are that because it was in NY the package was inspected since NY is the most paranoid state in the nation.<br /><br />-usashroomz<br />

				New York DOES check a lot of packages but the thing about NY is that they are very by-the-book so as long as you make the effort (like in this case) you can get the benefit of the doubt and pull it off. Chicago give less of a fuck about the rules and if they don&#039;t like the look of it, it&#039;s not going anywhere. This seems to be because Chicago gives less discretion to it&#039;s Customs officers than NY. I would always prefer a package to go through NY than Chicago or any of the other major ports of entry in the U.S.

				MY 2cents<br /><br />If you make your package look like its coming from a relative its much better. Use the recievers last name as a return address or order those little address labels you can order in the cheap magazines use express mail use the postage systems packaging i never had a package opened domestic or international using this method and i ship <br /><br />heroin<br />coke <br />meth<br />&nbsp;weed by the lb<br />pills ect<br /><br />dont over think shit and dont take the post office word on what they look for thats not too smart any way this is what works for me might not for you. shipping in the usa is the easiest shit you can do&nbsp; <br />

				Jersey is pretty bad. They are one of those states that love all their rules and laws. Also, if it is a domestic chain then it should be illegal for anyone to open it. What if they are legal papers from a law office containing confidential information on a case that NO ONE should be reading. Not even a post office official, which is just a $10/hour employee I think. Strange.<br />

				there is no such thing as domestic customs. Of course they check some domestic packages, that is the entire job of the united states postal inspector, to check domestic mail for drugs and other illegal shit and to carry out investigations against people who use the mail to violate federal law. Customs deals with international packages and anything else entering the country. International stuff has to get past customs and past USPI, domestic stuff never gets seen by customs.

				Obviously a drug dog hit on the package/envelope. Either the product wasn&#039;t vac sealed and throughly cleaned or maybe there was residue on the outside of the envelope.. like from leaving it around waiting to get mailed while you blast a bong, or your shipping supplies are not stored in a safe clean room :) idk<br />

Priority mail stamps can be purchased, with cash, at mom-and-pop stores WITHOUT cameras. Stamps are a dime a dozen, and can also easily be purchased off camera. There are sites that list where blue box&#039;s are within your area. There is no reason to ever step foot inside a post office to send a package. Printed labels, on a printer purchased with cash (let&#039;s say at a yard sale), to avoid the printer&#039;s fingerprints (small dots in a unique discernible pattern) being traced back to you. Wearing gloves, you can then drop the package in a blue box. <br /><br />As to the OP: If it wasn&#039;t vacuum sealed, which would look really weird for a candy bar, maybe they had a K9 that detected the smell? Otherwise, I do not see how it would be legal for the package to have been opened.

				Just to be clear - it was mushrooms in that chocolate bar - not pot - ya know, an edible?<br /><br />so why would it get opened if the first place?<br /><br />once USPS guy say it was a candy bar, he still undid the foil? why...<br /><br /><br />could only be that some other residue - say you were smoking a killer joint while packaging the candy bar - and that may have been what set off the K-9 or sniffer machine?<br /><br /><br />the crazy shit I get from around the world freaks me out - but if US-to-US Domestic is getting fucked with for apparently no reason, that makes the game a bit more interesting...

You would need socks5 proxies, virtual credit cards you buy with bitcoins, and a printer. Just print and tape it on the box with your other shipping labels. Bonus if you go make up custom boxes 10 a time each with a phony company logo on them.
