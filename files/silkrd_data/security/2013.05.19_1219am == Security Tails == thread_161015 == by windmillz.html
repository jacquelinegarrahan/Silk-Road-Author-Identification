				Today I upgraded my usb stick to the current version Tails .18 After my install/update Iceweasel started giving me this message about being in an unencryped area/site. I am connected to Tor so I am not sure what this means. If anyone can enlighten me I would greatly appreciate it. It happens when I try to connect to SR onion and forums. <br /><br />This is one message:<br /><br />The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.<br /><br />Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?<br /><br />-windmillz

				Run a packet sniffer (i.e. wireshark) between the computer and router and check to see if it is unencrypted.

				I found out that the wireless router was on a WEP 128bit encryption, I reset it and configured a WPA 2 Personal, major change... I still get the message that I am unencrytped pages and third party somethings could potentialy see etc.<br /><br />Also is there a way to install wireshark onto Linux, or a different way to find this information out, besides a sniffer? or is that the most accurate?<br /><br />Thanks for all the help just want to be secure!!

				Is this the message:<br /><br />You are about to leave an encrypted page. Information you send or receive from now on could easily be read by a third party.<br /><br />[Check Box] Alert me whenever I leave an encrypted page for one that isn&#039;t encrypted.<br /><br />Yeah, don&#039;t worry about that. Just uncheck the box to get rid of the warning. It&#039;s just reminding dumb people not to enter username/password over an HTTP connection. You should only do that over an HTTPS (encrypted) connection, except that&#039;s irrelevant on hidden services, because the connection is fully encrypt from the Tor client on your computer to the Tor client on the hidden service server.<br /><br />You *should* use only HTTPS to enter sensitive info on clearnet sites though.

				So 110% don&#039;t worry about it especially if im on a service through tor like the SR??<br /><br />This is the message I get when I try to log into the forums:<br /><br />The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.<br /><br />Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?<br /><br />with the text box saying to remind me or not....<br /><br />If you say its to be ignored Ill trust ya

				Your WiFi encryption has nothing to do with that; I&#039;m not familiar with Tails, but if astor&#039;s right (which he very nearly always is), then yes.&nbsp; Totally ignore it AS LONG AS you are on a .onion site.<br /><br />You MUST NOT ignore it if you aren&#039;t though.&nbsp; If you&#039;re on a non-&quot;.onion&quot; site, the warning fully applies.&nbsp; That&#039;s very important, hence the caps, heh :)&nbsp; I take it you only get that message when you try to log in?&nbsp; Because otherwise something is very fishy, as you aren&#039;t actually transmitting anything except the request for a page when you just surf to the forums.&nbsp; I mean you shouldn&#039;t be, anyway, which is why it&#039;d be fishy...

				Yeah, I booted the latest tails in a VM. When TorBrowser / Iceweasel starts, it takes you to https://tails.boum.org, some page on that site., which is using SSL. Immediately I entered my favorite web IP checking site, wtfismyip.com, and got that pop up message. It&#039;s just warning you you&#039;re going from an encrypted to an unencrypted connection.<br /><br />The part that Firefox / Iceweasel / TorBrowser / the Tails devs haven&#039;t fixed is if you enter an onion address, it IS encrypted the whole way. It&#039;s equivalent to an https connection, even though it says http. That&#039;s why I said don&#039;t worry about it, just disable it and keep in mind that when visiting clearnet sites, the exit node can potentially read anything you send over http, so don&#039;t send username/password.

				Thanks for the clearification there!! I just am very paraniod in general I just don&#039;t want to get caught for something silly that I could have prevented.&nbsp; So Im safe on ONION sites, even login pages but not through clearnet (I rarley uses it ever anyways, only for joining/connecting (accepting the agreement for connection) a network like at barns and noble for the free WIFI)<br /><br />Yes, SelfSovereignty It happens every time I log on and its tripping me out man!!! haha<br /><br />Thanks astor for the advice! As well as every one else feel alot better about the situation!<br /><br />-windmillz<br /><br />

				Yep, for onion sites, http is safe.<br /><br />For clearnet sites, you must use https for entering sensitive info.<br /><br />Now that you know that, disable the warning and don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;s a dumb a warning that doesn&#039;t understand the complexities of Tor.<br />
