				Ok so I&#039;m sure this question will have been asked on here loads but with the bitcoin market forever changing i thought i would ask again so i can get a more up to date answer! I&#039;m in need of bitcoins and a method to get them at a reasonable price. I did use blockchain (and pingit) before now although it was expensive it was quick and easy. Then that stopped so i heard about ukash and cashu so went of and got some ukash only to find out they no longer dealt with cashu and in the end managed to buy some bitcoins but with a 20% fee!! Finally i found BTC4CASH on here and was going to go and place an order today only to see that he has canceled his service!! <br /><br />Please someone help me!!! does anyone know a method i can get bitcoins that:<br /><br />A) Is reasonably fast<br />B) Has minimal fee&#039;s<br />C) Is safe<br /><br />any advice would be much appreciated or if your from the UK just let me know how you get yours!

				Do you need to be anon? <br /><br />If so your options are pretty limited.<br /><br />If not you could use Bitbargin/Localbitcoins via UKBT - go on at peak times to get the best prices, you can usually get BTC at about a £2-5 mark up fee.<br /><br />or SEPA transfer from your own bank into BitStamp, that takes approx 1-3 days.

				OKPay is the best I&#039;ve found and now converts directly to bitcoin with only a £4 fee for UK bank transfers.<br /><br />You can also do a transfer from OKPay to Mt. Gox for a small fee (?1%) if you want an actual marketplace.<br /><br />Also check out the bitcointalk forums for people willing to sell but watch out for scams.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Personally I dont like the idea of cash in person etc, the deal my go OK i.e. you get your BTC or whatever; but there&#039;s every chance some people dont have any BTC to sell and will knowlingly lie in wait to rob your cash.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just paranoid&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Can&#039;t you do online bank transfer, it&#039;s immediate with faster payments these days.

				I just used bitbargain.co.uk&nbsp; ..about ten minutes ago.<br /><br />฿0.2 cost me £17.50 ...no fees, no drama. <br /><br />They have various payment options, including pingit. <br /><br />All I had to do was register a mobile phone number. Bosh.<br /><br />Coins are now in my SR wallet.<br />From registering to having the coins at SR took about ten minutes.<br /><br />DEFINITELY worth a look if you wanna buy ฿itcoins in the uk. <br />

				Localbitcoins for me. Vendors with good feedback that take bank transfer.<br /><br />Piece of piss and not stupidly marked up if you choose your vendor.<br /><br />Bought 4 the other day when price was down, delivered to wallet within 5 mins. They do escrow too.<br /><br />

				Bank transfer - Transferwise<br />Transferwise - Bitcoin Central/MtGox<br />Bitcoin Central/MtGox - Wallet<br />Wallet - Tumbler<br />Tumbler - SR.<br /><br />Bitcoin Central is down atm, but thats the method i use in the UK, and i pay about 1.5% tops for the whole thing. <br /><br />Takes about 24hrs, but Transferwise offer you an option to speed it up for a fee.<br />

Honestly, every single stage of getting gear is becoming difficult now. Instawallet gone, Bitcoin Central fucking up all the time, Transferwise now not dealing with BTC Exchanges and SR only seems to run about as fast as an asthmatic ant with a heavy bag of shopping half the time.....ffs, it&#039;s a pain in the arse.<br /><br />Anyway, glad i got my BTC sorted a week ago...although they are currently stuck on Bitcoin Central so i can&#039;t actually use them!

				The BitcoinUK reddit page is always useful to check if you want to see how people are getting their BTC in the UK. I&#039;m not a reddit user, but this page has always been quite helpful for me. <br /><br />Currently the options seem to be:<br /><br />LocalBitcoins DOT COM<br />BitBargain DOT CO DOT UK<br />SpeedyBitcoin DOT CO DOT UK<br />BitcoinFridge DOT CO DOT UK<br /><br />Hope this helped.

				SpeedyBitcoin DOT CO DOT UK is the place to be i think at the moment<br /><br />You have to email them to get and invite code but i cant fault the service, theres a few little things like u cant see the price u are buying for but small price to pay as u can UKBT and i get them to send the coins straight to my Mt.Gox account really fast service aswell... just hope this place dont go down like blockchain did<br /><br />-Z<br /><br />( I hope a pray to charlie sheen that sr is back up soon...

				Don&#039;t buy from www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org<br /><br />Looks like a scam to me.<br /><br />Try OKpay. You need to verify yourself but you could always use some fake documents. Costs about the same as using localbitcoins since they charge a premium.<br /><br />I also always forget about VirWox. It is good. Convert from GBP to Linden dollers and then to BTC. You can use paypal or credit card. A bit of a delay while they confirm your payment but works well. You don&#039;t get as many BTC per GBP as you should but if you&#039;re struggling for somewhere to buy it is good.
