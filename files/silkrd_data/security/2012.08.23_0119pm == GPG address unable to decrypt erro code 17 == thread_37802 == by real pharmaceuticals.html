Could they have created a new one? One reason could be they forgot their passphrase, deleted their existing keys and created a new public and private key.&nbsp; Have you for what ever reason created a new public key or have you always used the same one.? Could also be a corrupt file in the installed application. Un-installing, re-booting your system and then re-installing the software might solve the issue.

				They can&#039;t have encrypted the message to your PGP public key. Tell them to resend it the message actually encrypted with your public key. It&#039;s a common mistake, but a recoverable one.<br /><br />@Wadozo, it&#039;s not possible for the sender&#039;s PGP key to be the issue if the recipient is unable to decrypt a message, since the sender&#039;s PGP key was never involved in encrypting any data unless they mistakenly encrypted the message to their own public key. To PGP Club! Investigate the Russian Postal System analogy I posted in the thread to see why. It would be like locking a box and sending it to your friend with no key attached. Then your friend gets it and thinks: &quot;WTF, I have no key for this!&quot;.<br /><br />While we&#039;re here, why are you using keyservers? That is not really a good idea for us here. You shouldn&#039;t upload anything to a server from your GPG software unless it&#039;s torified (downloading non-SRian information is fine). It&#039;s a hypothetical, but it could be used as an exploit to deanonymize you. Better safe than sorry!
