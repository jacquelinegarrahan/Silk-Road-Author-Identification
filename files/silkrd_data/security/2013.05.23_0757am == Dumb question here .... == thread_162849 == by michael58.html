				I made a Bitcoin deposit today and before making the deposit I changed my passphrase and pin ( Beefed them both up). The new passphrase worked fine as I had no problems logging onto SR. The PIN was a different story. I tried using the new pin to log onto the forums and got nowhere ..... just for the hell of it I tried the old pin and low and behold here I am with no issues. Shouldn&#039;t the account settings page have given me an error message if the pin change was not completed properly? It seems kind of odd that there were no error messages and it was only by chance that I decided to try the old pin number.to log onto the forums and post. I still want to change that pin but I am going to be making a transaction with a vendor tomorrow and I don&#039;t want to fuck things up to the point where I am locked out of doing any transactions.

				The SR pin has nothing to do with the forum. The only time you use it is when moving money out of your account, through a purchase or withdrawal. Try doing one of those things and entering your new pin there.<br />

				If you were asked for your PIN on SR forum, chances are you could have provided it to a phishing site. The best thing you can do is change everything again.
