				So I set up an order for BTC (using GBP) on Intersango and it has taken more than two days to do the exchange (still not done). Seems odd because when I used Mt Gox a few months ago it exchanged in a matter of hours. Is this amount of time for an exchange normal?

				What price did you put your bid in at?<br /><br />There are over 400BTC listed ready to go at Â£1.60 or higher.<br /><br />When you are signed in, go to this page https://www.intersango.com/orderbook.php<br /><br />It will show you the bids/asks that are currently available in your currency.<br /><br />I sell BTC there all the time, and either I put it in at a price I think it will hit in the next day or so, or if I&#039;m in a hurry, I put in a bid matching a current ask, and the deal is done in micro-seconds.

				I&#039;m impressed with Intersango when it comes to GBP/BTC transactions - Mt. Gox had 4 transactions in GBP yesterday, which means you don&#039;t / can&#039;t get near market value when buying or selling, the market isn&#039;t deep enough. <br /><br />Intersango does take a few days to get around to processing bank transfer withdrawals, but they don&#039;t charge for them, so that does balance out. Deposits they seem to process real quick like ;)<br /><br />Just remember how fucking quickly things move in this arena, and don&#039;t store any value you can&#039;t afford to lose with any of the online btc trading houses.

				Hey Roger, glad it worked out for you.<br /><br />Their fee structure is pretty damn good right now, I&#039;m just hoping once they get all successful and shit they don&#039;t start raping us with charges.<br /><br />Meanwhile, those fuckers outta give me a commission for all the recommendations I&#039;ve given them ::)
