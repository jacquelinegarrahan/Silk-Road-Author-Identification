				1. If it is not open source don&#039;t touch it<br /><br />2. Compile it yourself, if they provide binaries only don&#039;t touch them<br /><br />3. Wait for people who know the language it is in to go over the code and verify it. Multiple people. Preferably people with high post counts or good reputations.<br /><br />4. If their code requires that you use external programs or libraries, only use them if you independently download them, not if they are bundled together<br /><br />5. Download any potentially required additional software anonymously through Tor , from the official source only<br /><br />6. Make sure that any required additional software is open source and well known, not some shit thrown together by the person offering the original program but presented as separate <br /><br />7. The code must be posted publicly and available to everyone for auditing purposes. Sorry, no selling closed source programs here, it isn&#039;t secure. Sorry, no restricted access to code here, everyone needs to be able to see it to help the community determine if it is safe. <br /><br />8. Avoid buying preconfigured USB devices or electronics here. There are legitimate open source options like Liberte and Tails. Use those, they are free ! <br /><br />In general you should avoid using programs created by people on silk road. There could be some valid exceptions! If you don&#039;t violate any of the stated rules here, and someone offers something really nice and useful, you should be pretty safe. If any of the above rules are violated, don&#039;t touch that shit.

				People posting code here:<br /><br />1. Post all of your code in your original post (posts if it is too big) announcing your program. Sign and timestamp the code. Don&#039;t edit your posts in the future, they should not have an edited mark on them. <br /><br />2. Don&#039;t try to bundle other software with yours. If other libraries or programs are required, specify this. People can go and find them and download them themselves.<br /><br />people auditing code here:<br /><br />1. Post the sha512 hash of the signed timestamped code you audited. <br /><br />2. Describe how thoroughly you audited the code and your level of expertise in auditing code <br /><br />people using programs from here:<br /><br />1. Make sure you compile from the source, as I said before<br /><br />2. After seeing enough people have audited the code to feel safe, sha-512 sum the available code to make sure that it is the same thing that has been audited. <br /><br />potential updates to the program should be posted and signed and audited as well, preferably released as patches to the current code base.
