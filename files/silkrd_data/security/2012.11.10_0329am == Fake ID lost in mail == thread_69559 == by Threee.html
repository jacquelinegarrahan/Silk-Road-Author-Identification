				Title: <strong>Fake ID lost in mail</strong><br />

				What&#039;s up people - I have a question for the community.<br /><br />I have recently ordered a fake ID on SR from a trusted seller. Order placed, ID made and shipped, however, no sign of it in the mail. I am pretty sure the order was actually shipped, but it went missing on its way to me. I have had a few dozen packages delivered to the same address without any issues, this one was never delivered.<br /><br />Now, what worries me is that the ID obviously has my picture on it. Since I am not sure if it just got lost or might have gotten in the wrong hands, I want to make sure that I understand the following.<br /><br />1) What is the worst that can happen? How serious can the situation get?<br />2) How to prepare for an unwanted knock on the door? What to say?<br />3) Should I assume that my mail is now monitored?<br /><br />Given that it&#039;s not just a regular package, but a falsified state ID with my face on it, I can&#039;t just deny that it&#039;s mine, and say that someone sent it to me by accident. I am also a good few years over 21, so can&#039;t say I needed it to do underage stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to take this seriously, hit me with scenarios and solutions, better freak out and then prepare for the worst than not to count with possible outcomes.<br /><br />Thank you.
