				Consider the following:<br />A person sends Bitcoins from his local wallet directly to SR. All the generated addresses in your SR account are associated with your account for ever.<br />When SR gets raided, LEO could see all the BTC addresses for each user and search the global BTC transaction history where ALL IPs are stored. Your local IP as well.<br /><br />Is this true? I think so. But why does nobody warn us?

				good question, i&#039;ve asked before why SR doesnt expire addresses and permantly &#039;wipe&#039; them.. making the trail harder to follow..

				just send your coins to an online wallet. shortly after, go to library or other free wifi location that suits you, access your coins and send them from there, and so on (you see where this is headed). <br />if you are worried about data on your machine, then, encrypt it etc..<br />

You should bear in mind that as coins must be sent from the same address at which they&#039;re received in the first instance, it is theoretically possible to trace transactions across the block chain over 2, 20 or even 200 wallets. You can help yourself by spreading the amounts over different wallets and most importantly by using a mixing service.<br /><br />At the risk of self aggrandisement, if you buy your with BTC with cash rather than use a bank account then a BTC address cannot be linked to you nearly as easily.<br /><br />I have always been of two minds about using a public WIfi spot to access sites like SR. If your connection is Torified it will be encrypted making is near impossible to monitor which specific sites you&#039;ve visited though any fool will be able to see that your connection is encrypted. I would be concerned about people peering over my shoulder - of course if you have 3G tablet or phone it&#039;s possible to access the internet anonymously by using a Pay as you Go SIM chip to surf but do make sure you encrypt the device as 46&amp;2 says.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
