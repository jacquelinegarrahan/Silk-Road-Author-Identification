				So although I have a new vendor account I have been vending on SR for about a year now, and this is the first time something this stupid has ever happened and I just feel the need to share it because in my experience there are actually quite a few idiots on this site (no offense, but if you disagree you are probably part of the group of idiots) <br /><br />I received this message from &quot;xxxfactor&quot; <br /><br />&quot; Hello,i am a big fan of your products..i am very please with your services on SR, i was introduced to SR by a client of mine and coming across your profile, i am happy to do business with you... I am looking for a vendor..i am new to SR....so if you can be my supplier for these products, i will be very happy...i have clients but i loss contact with my old supplier..So get back to me for business. &quot;<br /><br />I respond<br /><br />&quot;Hey<br /><br />If you are located internationally and are new to SR you will have to purchase a tracked shipping option such as DCN or Express. Otherwise if you are located in Canada any domestic shipping option is fine. Cheers!<br /><br />WS&quot;<br /><br />NOW THIS is where it gets funny, sad, or just plain stupid depending on why she/he said this in response...<br /><br />&quot;Thanks for getting back to me and i am confident with your services, that is what made me to contact you..Like i said earlier i am looking for a reliable supplier, i buy this stuff to sell but i lost my old vendor and i am in the search for another...I was introduced to SR by one of my client. I do not know how SR functions especially with the bitcoin stuffs so i will prefer to deal with you via wu if you dont mind... Is there any instant means we can both be communicating like skype or something for you? Just get back to me and lets work out the deal..I deal only within Canada.Thanks and waiting.&quot;<br /><br /><br />My initial reaction - Is LE actually so misinformed they believe that a vendor such as myself would be stupid enough the deal with WU and to communicate with skype?<br /><br />Then I realize this is probably just a newbie who really does not understand anything and is probably going to be in arrested and in a juvenile detention facility by 2014. But then I remember how many idiots have shown there total lack of the simplest of security measures (not only of their privacy, but security of finances, accounts, etc) and another thought dawns on me...<br /><br />What if there are actually idiot vendors replying to this... What if some newbie vendors are dumb enough to reply. Well if you are one of those idiots hopefully reading this accomplished preventing you from fulfilling your idiotic destiny! =) <br /><br />Oh yea and I guess if any mods are reading this you might want to just delete that guys account or something? Not sure what the policy is about buyers asking vendors to deal in WU and chat on Skype. <br /><br />Hope everyone had a great weekend =) <br />

				I think that, if a person like that can reach this site, he must discover how to clean his fingerprints, how to not end in jail. <br /><br />There are a lot of idiots around, reddit is full of them, and there is a lot of forums that explain how to reach sr. If you have a little brain you have to know that what you&#039;re doing here is illegal. But, wtf, I know a hacker that can break in a lot of high security systems but doesn&#039;t know about bitcoin and he is still using wu and others payments methods for sell info and stuff... It&#039;s like you are giving all the info that the police need to make a good case. <br /><br />I can&#039;t understand how stupid is the people sometimes. <br /><br />That&#039;s why you have to read and read a lot, information is power, information is freedom, information is money, information is everything. If you are well informed about everything, you can be rich, you can be a criminal, you can do whatever you want and without chains in your hands.

				WS: tell the guy to ONLY use secure forms of communication and to brush up on his online skills. And tell him to read this section of the forums and to wake the fuck up!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169106.msg1208190<br />The US government is accessing private online information<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It boasts of what it calls &quot;strong growth&quot; in its use of the PRISM program to obtain communications.
