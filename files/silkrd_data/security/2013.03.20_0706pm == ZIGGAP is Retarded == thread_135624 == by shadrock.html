				So BitShitstain (my term of non endearment for the half-wit slackers known as Bitinstant) is not working again, no surprise there.<br /><br />BlueSky has no coins today, so I figured I might try ZIGGAP. Their website says they now take Moneygram and ZipZap payments, awesome.<br /><br />Here is the kicker, when you click to buy bitcoins this message comes up :<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We apologize about the inconvenience, but we&#039;ve temporarily stopped accepting orders. The market price is increasing so much we&#039;re taking a loss by selling Bitcoin. Once the market stabilizes we&#039;ll resume selling.<br /><br />Thanks for your understanding, and go buy some Bitcoin now before the price gets too high</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WHAT. THE. FUCK?<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t make any sense. Don&#039;t they purchase coins on demand in real time? If so just charge a service fee, that is what we&#039;re expecting, a nominal premium. Bitcoins are at an all time high. They could have bought a bunch a few days ago and then sold them for massive profits now. That is risky if the price goes down, so I assume they would be buying on demand.<br /><br />I guess they bought more expensive bitcoins in the future and that is why they can sell them for profit now? How else could the claim to be losing money?<br /><br />They end with a nice big fuck you. Go buy them before the price increases? That is what I went to you for god damn it!

				The reason they are losing money is because they provide you with a quote at the time of your order, and then by the time the processing of your order occurs, the exchange rate has increased to the point where their fee still doesn&#039;t cover the increase, so they honor their quote and lose money by doing so.
