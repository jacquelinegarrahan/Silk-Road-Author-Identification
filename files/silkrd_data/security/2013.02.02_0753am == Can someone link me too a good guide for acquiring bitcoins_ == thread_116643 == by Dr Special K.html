				Look up BlueSkyTraders with the forums search function.<br /><br />There are also reputable sellers who trade bitcoins for moneypak&#039;s or western union transfers.<br /><br /><br />You could also sign up for a mtgox account, link up your bank account, and get bitcoins through that service.<br />

				If u buy an mp for say 200 I can get u 200 worth in btcs no lie, vendors are cashing out there btcs an I&#039;ve done favors for some. My only request is a small fee for the trouble not 30+ % ect and youll have your coins in 10 mins. My fee would be 10% so a 200 dollar mp, you would get 180.00. If interested lemme know, pm me. Later
