				Only have coins in your SR wallet when you&#039;re about to buy something. To the best of my knowledge, the safest way to store them is to use the official Bitcoin application or an offline wallet for long term storage.

				I keep a couple coins on SR, just enough to make a small purchase or two, and not enough to represent a substantial loss of money for me. Most of my coins are stored on my Client on my desktop, multiple backups, encryption, etc.<br /><br />I like to have a few ready in case I see a product that is limited and I want to buy it without having to wait 6+ hours for all the confirms necessary.

				For now blockchain but after i get my coins out of it never again. They have a minimum amount that you have in order to send your coins. I put a small amount in my account to buy something for my first time didn&#039;t want to place a huge order so after the money clears i tried to transfer to sr and i get a minimum balance error and have to have like 95 dollars worth of bc in order to transfer. I wish their was a way around that stupid stupid method..

				I keep mine at the exchange and frequently move them to my wallet called MULTIBIT.<br /><br />My half-baked theory is that moving the coins back and forth from the exchange you bought them at and your wallet addresses, makes it look like your coins are actively moving around and you are an &#039;investor&#039;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not just buying coins and sending to one address and then into a&nbsp; tumbler.&nbsp; (Silk Road)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m quite sure people looking at the blockchain can tell it was a tumbler address it went to and get the idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;They can&#039;t prove shit, but they can suspect things that get you on a watched list perhaps.&nbsp; Maybe someday even on a np-fly list as s suspect launderer.<br /><br />Bitcoin-QT is the better wallet apparently.&nbsp; But yes, backup the godamn file for the wallet onto a stick or optical media. . hard drives go kaput all the time. . <br /><br />

				On multiple addresses in my Electrum bitcoin wallet that I&#039;ve got configured using a guide to work through tor. I love the fact that Electrum doesn&#039;t have to download the whole blockchain so you can do some transfers. I&#039;ve waited days for bitcoin-qt to finish up. Granted it&#039;s only the first run that you have to do this, but still. If you leave your client off for a while, it might take some time for bitcoin-qt to catch up again. I&#039;d rather just not deal with that and just use Electrum.

				I only buy and immediately spend them on SR. I&#039;m entertained by their investment potential, but the profit margin from turning them over as drugs is higher - with the exception of the $260 spike, and volatility like that is one of the reasons I&#039;m shy of really &quot;investing&quot; in them.<br /><br />So they&#039;re a drug tool. Occasionally the spare change left in my wallet inflates in value to buy me an extra treat, but that&#039;s as much as I mess with them.
