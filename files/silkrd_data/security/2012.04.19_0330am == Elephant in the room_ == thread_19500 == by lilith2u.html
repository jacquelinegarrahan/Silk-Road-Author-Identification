				Is it just me or is anyone concerned that were headed into a major sale, just days after a semi well known drug&nbsp; site goes down, with as its turning out! Ties to the road. thecloser29 for one. Personally this has had a major effect on me:( And lets not forget just two weeks ago thecloser29 and pay the piper and michael.murphy scams, just to name the ones i remember. Also there has been a hack of a seller released&nbsp; on the road, just in the last couple of weeks<br />Who thinks Pharvilles coming back? I have one trusted domestic seller i would buy from:(<br />On my end. major house cleaning......new computer too ( the other one needed replaced but fuck!) thecloser29 knows me:( Never bought or received from him. But we&#039;ve had lots of conversations and bullshit trying to get BTC he owed me......I&#039;m not alone here!<br />Please disregard the posts I&#039;ve made of wearing a foil hat.....it was sarcasm!&nbsp; I&#039;m not a paranoid person......I&#039;m a paranoid person now!......I say approach with caution!<br />I&#039;m just going to roll a fat one have a bottle of wine maybe a blue and hope all goes well........peace and be safe

				Oh Christ! It was up this weekend and must have been took down pretty quick. someone blackmailed a seller by hacking his account and posted all his info on SL everything......photo, Facebook account Mtgox acct # home and phone # girlfriends name. I didn&#039;t want to post because i didn&#039;t want it to happen to me......yikes. Cant find the post but haven&#039;t looked......not making it up, the person the &quot;hacker&quot;&nbsp; wanted 1000 BTC or he would post it. he didn&#039;t get it soooo&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s a side issue I was more worried with the cross over effect of The Farmers Market going down and the 420 sale that&#039;s all.

				The Farmers Market situation is unfortunate but really poses no threat to us at SR.<br /><br />Major sales are always dangerous as far as scams go. Just don&#039;t be an idiot and you&#039;ll be fine. Only buy from trusted sellers...<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t heard about the hacked vendor incident but I don&#039;t see what that has to do with this sale either?<br /><br />And Pharmville was just taking some time off to get his shit together so he could better serve his customers I thought?<br /><br />I have no idea what you&#039;re freaking out about haha.

I&#039;ve also noticed how the post as of lately have been getting meaner and meaner.......people calling people retards for thoughtful OP. I guess its just the new amount of new people joining? I don&#039;t know? I love the SR but won&#039;t be using any longer. And yes maybe Pharmville is coming back but i seriously think they were seeing the writing on the wall to same as paythepiper<br />Were losing the good reliable sellers to the not so sure of ones? Anyway if my house gets raided I&#039;ll be sure to keep it to myself. Don&#039;t want to freak anyone out or anything.........I&#039;m sure its all going to be fine........~sigh~<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You deserve a strong hug - here it is ...&nbsp; :-*<br />and i thought this is the karma thing for, if people rant about an OP, isn&#039;t it?<br />anyway, thank you for sharing your concerns, some people will find it valuable!

				i feel for ya lilith. i know some people lately on here have just been menacing jerks. im a bit worried too consider i had an order that got cancelled by him recently. im not in the same country though so im hoping i would be ok combined with the fact that my dropspot addy was encrypted and i never even received anything and my btc was refunded. dont feel discouraged to post. i sincerly hope you wouldnt get raided, but i doubt u would. if u were unfortunate enough i hope u share your story as soon as possible so other people could know about it.<br /><br />dont let others get u upset. you are right about there being an elephant in the room. .btw whoever did the post from the elephant, and actually took time to add the elephant pic as the avatar is freakin hilarious! i LOL&#039;d pretty hard at that!!<br /><br />MBMC

				Dear PETA I really didn&#039;t think anyone would actually believe I would sale or transport! an Elephant. I don&#039;t really work at a zoo! unless you consider life itself a zoo? and then yes i do. Maybe you just didt&#039;t follow the whole thread. In any case I&#039;m glad PETA exist and&nbsp; would even donate if I didn&#039;t think i was being put on a terrorist watch list:( I&#039;m a vegetarian , not yet vegan and the biggest animal lover I know!
