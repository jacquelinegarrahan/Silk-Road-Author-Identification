				Dude....&quot;pressured to make excuses for what you&#039;re doing?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Excuses to who...the bank tellers accepting your deposit???&nbsp; &nbsp;Just relax and don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED FOR AN ID.&nbsp; If you are going to BoA you need to ask for an out of state deposit slip instead of the ones right at the counter.&nbsp; It&#039;s no big deal...ask for a few extra so next time you can have the slip all filled out before you go in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Chase is even easier because its all the same slip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.

				It is perfectly legal to buy Bitcoins. Don&#039;t feel or act suspicious about it and you&#039;re fine. Make sure you tumble well.

				Great responses.<br /><br />I was curious about excuses mainly because the tellers like to be extremely chatty around here. Also, I have known bankers (... well, credit unioners) who feel it is their responsibility to personally identify every transaction.

				My experience with the cash deposit option is similar to everyone else: you walk into the bank, tell the teller the account to deposit it, give her money, take receipt and leave the bank, no id required...a few hours later you will have bitcoins. I&#039;ve used this option with get-bitcoins a few times and every experience has been smooth and hassle free, no need to be nervous.

				there are tons of places online to spend bitcoins, every one of them legal.&nbsp; look it up!<br />BOA is so easy if you are in a city.&nbsp; I can understand if you are in a small place where the tellers are chatty...they are very inquisitive.

				Banks tend to just want your money. I&#039;ve never been asked for ID regardless of the account, bitcoin related or not.

				I&#039;ve never heard of this, can someone post a step by step.&nbsp; I go to a BoA fill out a (foreign?) deposit slip and give them cash.&nbsp; What account am I depositing the money into and how does it get converted to Bitcoins?&nbsp; I know I can link any bank account with dwolla and transfer funds to dwolla and on to Mt Gox to buy the Bitcoins but the 5 day lag is a bummer.&nbsp; Is there a way to use BoA to get the coins quickly?&nbsp; How?

				The website supplies you with an account number and name for the account - Get Bitcoin LLC. Put those on the deposit slip, fill in the amount of cash to deposit and take it to the teller. Mine took the deposit no questions asked and gave me a receipt. Save the receipt and scan it or take a picture, then e-mail it to Get Bitcoin with your order number. I had bitcoins in my wallet within 11 hours of the deposit.

				1. go to www.getbitcoin.com<br />2. order bitcoin choosing BOA deposit method<br />3.&nbsp; Get email from get bitcoin LLC with deposit info (bank account number and name of company, I chose checking account on deposit slip) I&#039;m not 100% sure if its an email or if it appears on the screen after I place the order...lol<br />4.&nbsp; Take cash (exact change) and go to bank.&nbsp; get deposit ticket, it will ask for all kinds of information you don&#039;t have.&nbsp; ignore that.&nbsp; just fill in the name and account number and amount.&nbsp; <br />5. take cash to counter and say I&#039;d like to make a deposit, and smile nicely.<br />6.&nbsp; take receipt, I take a picture of it (not at the bank, at home) and attach it to the email I send back to them with order number <br />7. wait 24 hours max
