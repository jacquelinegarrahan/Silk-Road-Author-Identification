				So the BTC was at nearly £6 the other day and now it&#039;s gone down to £5.50. Where the 50p gone in the last 24 or whatever hours? <br /><br />Up please, not down.

So aye if someone is using bit coins for buying and the prices are &quot;hedged&quot; is that the rite word? Then it makes no difference to us, the prices will fluctuate in line with the USD/BTC rate. <br /><br />Man i have no bit coins just now but I have some funds i can use but it all seems a bit too crazy just now. Would it be a good idea to to buy some while the price has dropped a bit and sell them back for GBP when it goes up? I can see some fun in this =)

In future I&#039;ll suggest he cashes out gradually. :-D<br /><br />V.

				To be honest, you should advise him to do that for his own selfish needs as well as mine lol. Flooding the exchanges means the price goes down because there are more available (obviously, that&#039;s the law of supply and demand lol) selling a that many over a series of days then it&#039;ll keep the value nice and high so we all get more for our work. ;)<br /><br />

				Nice maybe some of us should hash some sort of investment scheme with this. The way I see it is there are lots of ways to shave off $$$ with BTC inflation &amp; economics. ;D
