				Ever since i tried buying some btc on ebay, paypal has limited my account and they want faxed i.d.&#039;s, bank statements, etc, etc. Ive got $61 in paypal and they wont let me withdraw it to my bank, but they will let me send it to someone or spend it on ebay/etc. Anyone know of any options on how to get the money out of paypal and trade it for dwolla, btc, or moneybookers. I was already on #bitcoin-otc and i already registered and got authenticated, but now i cant figure out how to get &quot;voiced&quot; after i already registered.

				stay away from paypal.&nbsp; they can hold your money for up to 180 days (which is what they will do now) with no reason, as per their ToS.<br /><br />Move along, come back at christmas time and get your money out then send them a support ticket that says &quot;go fuck yourselves&quot;.&nbsp; Dont&#039; touch paypal with a ten foot pole - they are in bed pretty deep with the state.

				The issue of buying bitcoins with Paypal has come up in a few other forums.&nbsp; Since you&#039;ve said Paypal will still let you send money to another person, you have a way to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; Sites like Bitmarket.eu let people buy &amp; sell bitcoins; many sellers accept Paypal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works: you buy your Bitcoins on Bitmarket.eu and pay for them by quietly sending the seller payment through Paypal.&nbsp; You use the &quot;Send Money&quot; option on Paypal, and NOWHERE do you indicate that the payment is for bitcoins.&nbsp; Under the &quot;Send Money&quot; tab you check the box for &quot;personal payment&quot; (I think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called).<br /><br />Your transaction record will look something like this: &quot;Personal payment of $60.00 made to SomeGuy@gmail.com&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t like Paypal&#039;s restrictions either, but since you have money tied up there you may as well use it.

				Sorry I misread that you could still send it to someone else.&nbsp; I thought you were saying your money was locked up there (I had paypal lock up 8k on me for 180 days - the bastards were making free interests on money market deposits and I had no recourse.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used them since).&nbsp; <br /><br />
