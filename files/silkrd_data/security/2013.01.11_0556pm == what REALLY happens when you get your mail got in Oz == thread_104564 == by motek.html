				AFOAF was in Brisbane and he had some x sent to a PO Box of an associate, and made the mistake of telling said associate the contents of said parcel....unfortunately said associate got mucho paranoid and actually took the fuckin delivered parcel to the police telling them he knew there was &quot;something&quot; in it, and also who it was &#039;for&#039;<br /><br />Now, here&#039;s where old mate was smart&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; at least he had had the parcel sent to a fictitious name, SO, when the cops came and arrested him that night, at his home, he denied ANY knowledge of the contents of the package, fuck he denied the package itself..there weren&#039;t any reasons to try and &#039;save&#039; the relationship with the &#039;associate&#039;, so lie goddamit, and lie well!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So apparently he refused to give the police any more than his name rank and serial # while they kept at him for a few hours saying shit&nbsp; like &quot;admit you know what&#039;s in the package, ffs we know you do, and you&#039;ll get bail and be out tonight BUT, if you don&#039;t tell us, weeelll it&#039;s a Federal offence aaannnd it will probably take at least a year to get to trial, and we&#039;ll make sure you don&#039;t get bail&quot;&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&nbsp; Well, old mate knew the deal, kept his mouth shut, and they kept their word and no bail was given, and he was remanded.<br /><br />The cops knew that plain ole email had been used to arrange said package BUT they never checked the accounts.<br />They could have taken his ph&nbsp; BUT they didn&#039;t<br />They didn&#039;t find his computa, and never asked about one!<br /><br />It seemed that these two detectives who extolled the level of their education (university apparently! :-\) were happy to be able just to charge old mate with importing, even if it was only a tiny amount and they had no admissions or real proof.<br /><br />Old mate said his GF arranged a great lawyer for him however it was clear the crown was going to continue to oppose bail, and as old mate wasn&#039;t in his &quot;home state&quot; they regarded him as a &#039;flight risk&#039; and kept him remanded.&nbsp; &nbsp; The point being, IF he had been in his home town, bail would have been certain ;)&nbsp; Joe Average doesn&#039;t go to prison for personal amounts of any drug these days, even in QLD :o<br /><br />After 2 court appearances, (14days total) where it seemed the cops &quot;premonition&quot; about the case taking a year to get to trial was looking somewhat accurate, he accepted to take a &#039;plea&#039; admitting (while in court and ONLY with his lawyers assistance) to the package containing MDxx, and having been a party to its importation, and got a $2,000 bond and a 1 year suspended sentence, and released from the courthouse shortly afterwards......btw he had quite an extensive record for cannabis possession, had he been a &quot;cleanskin&quot; it most likelywould have just been a bond.<br /><br />Points being:&nbsp; &nbsp;the mail gets through MOST of the time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - loose lips get you busted, DONT TELL ANYONE!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - plausible deniability is your friend....make sure you have it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - even IF you DO get caught the penalties are mild ..... Oz aint the USSA! :P thank fuck! 8)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				Being a fellow Australia this story scares me in that it shows the lengths police will go to just to get convictions.<br /><br />Sadly he could have just waited in prison until his court date and then would probably have got released without any conviction or sentence, but that would mean spending a year in jail. I bet the police knew this too and purposely pushed back his trial date to make him crack.

				Why did he have it sent to the &#039;mates&#039; PO box? Was the intention for the &#039;mate&#039; to take the fall if it went wrong?

				haha, actually having a bit of a bad day motek. good call ;D<br /><br />im just finding it hard to believe. anyone can have anything sent to anyone. <br /><br />lets say, i order some pills, to myself, and when i get them, goto the police, tell them a friend of mine (moksha) ordered them to my pobox, and im now worried. are the cops going to go and arrest him all because i said he ordered them to my PO BOX. is it me or does this all seem a bit far fetched?<br /><br />you said they didnt check his phone, they didnt check his computer / find his computer, yet they knew a plain email account was used? how did they know if your mate said nothing?<br />or was did he run through the entire thing with the person he got the gear sent to?<br /><br />you said he refused to give any info except his name, rank and serial number........ is this army and MP business? i dont get it.......<br /><br />there is something called sufficient evidence, and i dont see enough cause to hold him. granted he has a record, but you cant go off the word of someone who has a thai mailorder bride...<br /><br />this just all seems so&nbsp; damned strange and stinks of bullshit...<br />however, humor us.... im keen to hear more ;D

				humor you&nbsp; :P&nbsp; na I&#039;ve read a few of your posts shiz and i was suprised at the attack, you normally seem so, so....reasonable&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Not army, just slang for name and DOB... you have to remember this IS in Brisbane Queensland&nbsp; AND the guy had a healthy prior record.<br /><br />I was told that the PO box owner, who knew there were drugz in the package, took it to the cops and told them&nbsp; :o&nbsp; and they opened it and found &quot;something&quot; so they went and arrested this guy, coz he was fingered by his &quot;colleague&quot; (they worked together)<br /><br />The crazy part is, the mail was sent to a pseudonym, and as such was completely &#039;deniable&#039; by&nbsp; anyone who had the unopened package and made no admissions...but by the time the cops arrested this guy, they HAD something, which considering this guy had had something sent....and when the cops said &#039;how&#039; they got it,&nbsp; stood completely to reason.<br /><br />not a &#039;mailorder&#039; bride but a chick he had mey who was currently in Oz whom he wanted to marry, and was worried about something like this affecting this somehow! <br /><br />IMO&nbsp; What&#039;s really amazing is this fuckwit PO box dude just gave old mate up when NO ONE had been &quot;caught&quot;&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp;Go figure?&nbsp; That&#039;s what I call paranoid!<br /><br />The email aspect was again info he had shared with his colleague, but I dont think they knew &#039;who&#039; had sent it....apparently they wanted old mates email address ... old mate had said he used public computers, and I dont think they had any reason to think other wise

				jesus, didn&#039;t you know that truth IS stranger than fiction?&nbsp; &nbsp;far stranger&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just can&#039;t understand why someone would knowingly agree to have something sent, then when it arrives take it to the Police, unless he deliberately wanted to set the guy up. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Apparently a few months between agreeing to accept his mail and the package actually coming, situations changed, shit happened, and this guys girl came on the scene and he decided to go all goody two shoes ::)<br /><br />yeah the whole thing was fucked up, that&#039;s why I wrote about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t get ME wrong, I&#039;ve personally never had ANY &#039;problems&#039; with the mail...ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;And Boy! have I had some experiences with the mail, both domestic and international...No Problema!&nbsp; But this IS an example of how things can go wrong if you involve &#039;others&#039; in your business,&nbsp; tis best learned early that the safest way to travel on the Silk Road, is alone. :-X<br />
