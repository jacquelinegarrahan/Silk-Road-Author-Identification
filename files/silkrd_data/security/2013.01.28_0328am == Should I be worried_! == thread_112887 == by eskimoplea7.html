				A vendor for MDMA offered a reship and wrote the city I live in with an unencrypted message<br /><br />and im kinda feeling sketchy about why he would do that in the first place<br /><br />this is me really being parinoid but does anyone think that vendors would snitch you out if things went sour?<br /><br />I mean they do have your address and could just call the police and have them show up at your door if the vendor wanted to fuck you over.<br /><br />any advice on the first problem I stated would be great<br /><br />-thanks

				First are you ordering domestically or overseas?<br />Next are you buying bulk or only personal usage amounts?<br />3rd is it a reputable vendor? I assume not since he still has your address.....<br />

				the vendor is OA and he ships from the Netherlands<br />and the rehip was for a bulk amount <br /><br />i would have been fine if he asked me for my public key. i didnt think he would reveal my info like that.<br /><br />he is kinda sour about the whole ordeal leading up to that point so thats why i ask if anyone thinks a vendor would snitch someone out

				I think he is just mad over the deal.<br /><br />Like u said, he has all ur info regardless,&nbsp; so him putting it out unencrypted would maybe make me pause as well, but i don&#039;t think it means much.<br /><br /><br />

				thanks for your opinions on the matter<br /><br />im just worried that if any thing did happen with LE it could be traced back to me <br /><br />because of his carelessness, who knows i guess im just paranoid

				Sounds to me like he is just confirming your address. He should have used encryption and perhaps he just holds onto your address until he knows&nbsp; you got your package. <br /><br />If there is a dispute with a buyer I assume he would have to submit some kind of proof to the resolution center that he did mail it. Wouldn&#039;t he need your address for that.<br /><br />He should have used encryption thoug<br /><br />You might want to ask him about it. Let him know it made you uncomfortable. See what he has to say about it. Try not to be confrontational at first. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />
