				Doing a bank transfer is not a good way of buying btc as it is not anonymous.<br /><br />A generally accepted way of buying btc anonymously in the UK right now is:<br /><br />Register for MTGox with an anonymous email address (tormail.org). Don&#039;t use Tor to connect to MT Gox, they don&#039;t allow that. They may freeze your account and it adds unnecessary attention. Goto Starbucks and do it over a normal internet connection.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to &quot;verify&quot; your MT Gox account when it asks. Make your default currency GBP when signing up.<br /><br />Within MT Gox account, goto &quot;Funding Options&quot; and copy down the details for a UK bank deposit (account holders name, sort code, account number and your accounts reference code).<br /><br />Put on a hat and goto your nearest Barclays and pick up a pay-in envelope and the little slip that goes inside it. Fill it out with the MTGox details, stick the cash in, put the envelope into the quick pay in box. You can take the envelope and slip away and fill it out elsewhere if you wish. The slips asks for the name of the person who paid it in. Either leave this blank or put a fake name. It&#039;s not required.<br /><br />Shortly you will have cash in your MT Gox account anonymously. Go to a free wifi place again - Costa this time (randomness is good), log in to MT Gox and buy bitcoins with the cash.<br /><br />Then it&#039;s mixing time.<br /><br />Good luck

				Santander has it down for the cautious but still practical method (not the completely safe/paranoid ones(. Don&#039;t follow it myself though.<br /><br />Since you were doing bank transfer before do the same to Mt. Gox - just don&#039;t use Tor.

				A few guys I know and ladies, used intersango and done a simple bank transfer, either in person or online.<br /><br />Bitcoins are legal. <br /><br />Its like money in that you can buy illegal things with it.<br /><br />So buyers, who bought a few hundred BTC have nothing to fear whatsoever. Vendors who maybe put thousands through their accounts and have no proof of earning might be in trouble as banks cooperate with police and customs and so on.<br /><br />I was stuck for BTC but got a buddy who will stick some coins on a USB stick. He is looking to trade now that the UK is kind of devoid of any big sellers.<br /><br />I wish I would have bought a few thousand BTC at £2 also.<br /><br />But, knowing my luck at gambling the bitcoin would be worth 50p, which matters little to anyone apart from those who invest in bitcoins.<br /><br />Thing is, after legal advice, nobody knows anything about trade of bitcoins and legality. It is legal but paying taxes is difficult but registering the business is simple. Hard part is paying a top coder because if you got a site with bitcoins you got hackers looking to break in and steal them. That &#039;is&#039; possible, its been done before, but a good security system and your pretty safe.<br /><br />Would be cool to have a buddy trade in BTC, I could sell the things here, legally. I would have to say that I do not condone any illegal activity, but its just words to protect me. I know some might use coin to buy heroin but my boss pays me in currency which is more accepted by drug dealers, cold hard cash in hand, no fucking bank transfer for the Red, cash, in hand, taxes paid of course, and I have a bank account for paying bills because its a pain paying in person. <br /><br />All I buy here is ebooks. And am looking at a bargain laptop also - plus other computer parts sold here along with clothes, sunglasses, writing services, car parts, software, security shit, Linux usb sticks, would not buy Windows as that would be stealing off Mr Gates. The guy deserves his billions. I am paying £400 for Windows 8 and think Gates is better than the Apple guy who died which was bad marketing, made me wonder if Apple was jinxed and if I bought an Apple I&#039;d die of cancer.<br /><br />So, not sure how you sell coin here, don&#039;t fancy being a coke vendor for example, admire some of them but I am a pussy when it comes to serving more than 8 years, Also fear the USA kidnapping me if I sold an 8 ball to some Yank cop with a hard on for banging up people who use drugs we won&#039;t let people use because we are not clever enough to use them or we would suck dick for crack if we bought a gram of weed (gateway). Drugs, all that stuff, its illegal because this is 2012 not 2512 when drugs will be legal and therefore all high grade. We will have invented new drugs but cocaine, weed, hash, LSD, heroin, all those drugs will be here in 500 years time still. New drugs will be better. We will have drugs designed on some DNA template, drugs for every occasion, drugs to take away the lows after the highs. Drugs that help the human beings develop brains that are faster and more powerful. Drugs played a part in evolution. The search for different experiences has made us pretty good. Had humanity stayed sober we would still be grunting, living in caves and we would not even build an abacus never mind some laptops. Life would suck. Not just because there are not drugs but because we would not evolve because we&#039;d be like animals, basically not thinking a lot, not able to process things and become lazy and predictable.<br /><br />So, a bit of an aside there but just passing time and getting paid to write this is touching really. Makes me realise that my job is a good one really. Most of the people I work with use drugs. We smoke hash/weed in work sometimes. Depends on the job. Some jobs its sober as a judge because one mistake and someone is going to be getting scraped off certain machinery. Tonight, we could take LSD, but with just guys, and all of in work clothes and at work, one of us would have a bad trip. Point it, we work hard, play hard, and every job we do is passed by the authorities concerned, rubber stamped as &#039;safe&#039; and at that point. We can do 60 hours work in 20 hours or less. that leaves us 40 hours to get on with life. Some of the guys sneak home and read the children a bedtime story, I suspect they also have some passion with the wife or GF or with one of the guys, his boyfriend who cooked us all some curry and got us all high with hash cake. I said marry him! Wish I was gay myself, I&#039;d get a decent present on Christmas, not just socks, aftershave and boring stuff like slippers, another jumper (I don&#039;t wear jumpers ever, but they buy all the same) Gay men, usually give classic male presents. Ipods, gadgets, maybe top headphones and the things a women would never think to give a guy.<br /><br />So, if you got some anti gay thing in your head, give me bad neg, because I&#039;d give you a slap if you hurt my hash cake guy. Then again he is 6 foot 2 and works out 7 days a week. He used to use steroids but now its all natural, just a smoke after the 2 hr workout Mon-Fri (7-8am, 6-7pm) and weekend he uses his own gym he built. Red tried it out impressed all with my abs and biceps. Don&#039;t want to boast but I think the gay guys were flirting with me. For a slice of that hash cake (an oz of bud stripped of resin with CO2) I&#039;d flirt again and will as we got the invite for a dinner and got to say, food is top class, plus we could rail some coke if we don&#039;t do some E or shrooms.<br /><br />Anyone picked a shroom yet?<br /><br />How many UK will be vending the shrooms very soon?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Sure, pick a few bin bags, only its illegal, so don&#039;t do that! You can eat them fresh and its legal. Dry them its illegal. So, I plan to dig up the ground and sell the fresh shrooms via post. Shrooms at 1 BTC per 25 grams. P&amp;P will be 34 BTC second class. Guess its all the soil and grass. But worth it as you can plant the shroom turf in the garden and get some shrooms next year and in 5 years have a garden full of mushrooms. Enough to get you into the local psych unit no problems. For real! Be careful with the shrooms.<br /><br />And, no, not done any tonight. I&#039;m just hyped up because we got such a fucking easy week and I came in tonight after being told that it was not worth using uop holidays or fake illness days when we were basically just sitting around, doing things on our computers, some guy watching YouTube drunk Russians!<br /><br />Those Russians! Worked with them of course. Worked with a lot of foreign guys but Russians, maybe the hardest of the lot when it comes to partying. Mostly drink but they smoked hash because getting other workers high ensures we have no rats in the pack. <br /><br />Laters.<br /><br />And that news, the guy who killed those cops was the sort of scum that making drugs illegal has created. A bully who saw opportunity to earn cash being a dealer or some muscle for dealers. Real hero killing two women. Fuck him and all the gangsta shitheads who would hopefully all OD on drugs if drugs were legal. I&#039;d encourage them to snort 7 grams of cocaine HCL in a night. Even better, inject 7 grams of pure washed Afghan off the boat top grade The best shit on the planet (heroin) for your first ever hit of heroin (and last)<br /><br />Making drugs legal would save a lot of cops and civilians saved from the threat of some armed lunatic who is empowered by the illegality of drugs.<br /><br />I moved from an area which had gangs openly showing weapons on the street. In the /USA this is normal but in the UK, its usually bad news for the community which has gangs who use violence to protect territory. Stray bullets, bomb fragments, even the theft by junkies is all down to the illegality of drugs. Hit and runs, even the poor addicts who die aged early 30s, its down to drugs being illegal. Having pure drugs would kill off a few fools and obviously a kid or two would find daddies stash just like they find the meds and booze. But if you buy a safe and then put your stash in the garden down a plastic pipe, in s sealed baggie with your stash bags inside that bag, its safe from the under 12s and most 13 - 16. If drugs were legal, kids would not be so keen on using them to rebel against parents or society. Now in UK its seen as &#039;cool&#039; to smoke a joint when aged 14 upwards. Peer pressure is made easy because drugs are illegal and kids get pressure to do illegal things. <br /><br />Drugs should be for adults not children. Using drugs before your brain is fully grown is an issue. Using weed too young is wrong because your brain needs to stay sober due to the fact it is working at its best when young. Aged 12 to 16 is VERY important. What happens them shapes your future. Study hard, you maybe have a good future secured. But study is not for everyone and Red just worked because the guys in Uni could barely afford to smoke hash everyday! I was earning enough to take them out but they remember that would always help the Red out if he asked. <br /><br />I admit, I see a friends home as a free B&amp;B for a night or two. <br /><br />Never overstay a welcome! My home is the same. People stay. I give people the keys when I go away. I&#039;ve swapped homes with a guy in Portugal I worked with. I&#039;ll sleep in the car if needs be. Many a night I done that and claimed for a Hotel as we lied about off the road B&amp;Bs we found, expensive ones with salmon served at breakfast. Those days have gone. Now its all digital and the boss pays for the hotel. We tried to bribe the staff to just hire out the room to someone else - but no initiative was shown. Staff could have earned £80 in less than a minute. We could have won some more funds for our causes. Tax man loses but who cares about that?<br /><br />If I was working for a chain hotel, some Holiday Inn style place, I&#039;d hire rooms by the hour, say £5 an hour, then sell Viagra so the guys were there for maybe 5 hours which means the girls earn more and the bar would be open all night with maybe some discreet lines, joints outside on the veranda, some D&amp;B and some MDMA sales on the sly. It could be an earner. It would be a place many members here would stay&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Don&#039;t think I don&#039;t know you like to get high.<br /><br />How did I guess!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Laters for now.<br /><br /><br />

The question is why do the simple bank transfer and not the anonymous way for a tiny bit extra effort.<br /><br />Regardless, the weak link in the process will always be the vendor that has your address.
