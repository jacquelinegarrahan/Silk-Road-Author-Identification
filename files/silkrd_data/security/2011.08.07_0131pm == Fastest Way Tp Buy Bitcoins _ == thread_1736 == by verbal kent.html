				Yeah I wouldn&#039;t mind a response to this either, especially now that I learned it takes 5-10 days to complete a single transfer of money. <br /><br />And the fact that Dwolla requires photo ID verification.<br /><br />I need a Dwolla alternative, preferably something quicker/safer. I don&#039;t mind if the fees are a little higher.

				I have used nanaimogold.com (WU), wm-center.com (WU) and bitcoinbux.com (GDMP) successfully a few times to fund a few different kinds of e-currencies, including Bitcoin and Pecunix. Every single transaction has gone through the very same day, usually in under 12 hours. Is this fast enough for you?

				use libertyreserve.com<br /><br />protip: you cant access your liberty reserve account over tor, so use public wifi.<br /><br />you can fund your account thru one of the exchangers with western union. <br /><br />takes about 24 hours from cash to btc.

				Fastest way I have come across is to buy btc from bitcoinexchange.cc or bitcoinbux.com using greendot moneypack. It does cost a fee but is well worth it if you need a fast anonymous transaction. You could also get mtgox USD codes and buy btc when the market favors it. Lots of options.

				Bitcoinbux no longer takes moneypak or netspend cards. I just go to the bank and deposit into their account. During business hours, it takes a couple hours before the btc shows up in your account.<br /><br />But then again, i really don&#039;t care if i&#039;m on camera at the bank or anything. I&#039;m also not out buying kiddie porn, dirty weapons, nukes, or pounds of any illicit substance.<br /><br />So i guess i just don&#039;t care &gt;:)<br /><br />

				sending western union to a foreign liberty reserve exchanger is probably the safest and fastest way to do it. there are fees, but the security of it makes it worth it in my opinion. even if they did try to trace the btc, it would be a very long time before they made it all the way back to the western union shop that you used, possibly enough time for the security tapes to be overwritten.<br /><br />this works both ways. if you have the foreign liberty reserve exchanger sending you cash with western union, a security question and answer will allow you to pick it up with no ID.&nbsp; there are limits on the amount you can pick up without ID, so find out what they are before you do this with large amounts.

				virwox really rapes you on the fees, and there can be a big gap between rates of linden and BTC.<br /><br /><br />You can also only get whole amounts of BTC.

				I feel like I have answered this question three times in the last week.<br /><br />Fastest/Cheapest method for US citizens: <br /><br />exchangebitcoins.com cash deposit at Chase/WU branches.<br /><br />If you are buying bitcoins, you have much much less to worry about than if you are selling bitcoins.&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s going to care if you are buying a shitload of bitcoins every week.&nbsp; However, if you are withdrawing a shitload of cash every week.&nbsp; someone is going to take notice.

				just made my first deposit with exchangebitcoins -- made a reservation on saturday, went into a bank, deposited cash as per directions from their site and had money in the account within 1 hour.&nbsp; it&#039;s certainly not perfect, but it&#039;s a lot safer than dwolla and all that noise.

They will know who you are via Moneybookers and whomever sells you the coins might not be a guy like us here and freely hand over your details to LE if pinched.
