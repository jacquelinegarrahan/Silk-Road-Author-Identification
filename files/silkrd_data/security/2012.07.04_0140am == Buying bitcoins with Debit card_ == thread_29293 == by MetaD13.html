				Suggestions? Currently have $50 debit card, will be making purchase soon if I can convert.<br /><br /><br />Also should I buy these coins while on Tor or regular internet browser? I know some exchanges don&#039;t allow proxies but I&#039;m a bit concerned about security(if you couldn&#039;t tell by now I&#039;m new to SR).<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance!&nbsp; :)

				Personally I use Virwox, it&#039;s a digital currency exchange. <br /><br />Don&#039;t use Tor for the actual purchase, if you&#039;re really paranoid about security you can send your bitcoins to bitcoinfog first and then on to here which will disguise them for you and give you protection.<br /><br />If you use a proxy your card may not work and could get blocked, the IP has to match the cards registered location.<br /><br />You can also purchase moneypaks and trade them on here with a vendor for coins, but I personally don&#039;t trust this method as you can get scammed, although there are a lot of &#039;reputable&#039; vendors.

				Dont get ripped off by a MP vendor!<br />Just use bitinstant, and coinapult to your email or tormail, you will have your coins 1 hour after your deposit and in your sr wallet in 5 hours total or less. Deposits are made at the bank closest to you, very many to choose from and deposits are anonymous and not associated with bitcoin, just &quot;trustcash llc&quot; a separate llc from bitinstant

				I wouldn&#039;t use a debit card to buy btc, but that&#039;s just me. I&#039;d cash out the card and then deposit the cash via bitinstant or use the cash to buy a moneypak. Using cash is always safer than cards because they leave an electronic &quot;paper trail.&quot; Dwolla-&gt;MTG is the least expensive way to obtain btc but it just takes so long for Dwolla to clear the transactions if you don&#039;t consent to a credit check for instant approval and they have your bank and other information. I&#039;d rather pay the extra 5% for same-day btc purchases, but again that is just me. Cash deposits are nominally more anonymous than Dwolla-&gt;MTG for the reasons stated above, but there is still a risk with cameras etc. Depending on how many btc you plan on using, there are a number of reputable vendors on the SR that will help you, and are the safest option for laundering or buying suspicious amounts of btc. Limitless is one that comes to mind, and there are others.

Btc fluctuate by the minute but I believe more and more people are using btc so the fiat price reflects the demand. Personally, I think this is a good thing because it shows that people are confident in the value of btc.

Also, there is no doubt that LE follows large btc transactions to the furthest extent. If it is possible, they will do it.

After the first 30 days, you can transfer as much as you like at any time to any Dwolla account. Supposedly this is a security measure, but I can&#039;t see how this would make anything more secure. As others have said, I would personally advise against using Dwolla to purchase bitcoins. I personally do not like the idea of giving anyone my bank info if I can help it. A cash deposit via bitinstant is faster and safer, but costs 5% of your purchase. Seems worth it to me if you want to be safer and have bitcoins in your SR account the same day.

If I weren&#039;t so cautious, I&#039;d use Dwolla all day long because fuck all these fees! But I&#039;m not willing to take the risk, even if it is slight.

				A Jury would not be swayed by the bitcoins = drugs argument.<br /><br />The price of bitcoins has rocketed so investing is actually a job for some lucky bastards.<br /><br />Also, bitcoins are mined (created on computers with powerful and expensive graphic cards)<br /><br />There are a ton of legal goods on sale here. Anything from a iphone to a handbag.<br /><br />And BTC gambling. <br /><br />BTC charity.<br /><br />BTC is just money. Money is used to buy drugs but no jury would convict on the strength of money being found.<br /><br />Anyone buying hundreds of bitcoins via bank transfers, avoids the tax vendors charge whilst if everyone bought BTC openly then we would see it widen so that we end up with a BTC ebay or BTC pay per view watching me suck my own manhood.<br /><br />Me love you long long time. 4 BTC for 30 mins of long love time.<br /><br />Send BTC to whatever - redalloverthelandguy<br /><br />Long time love!<br /><br />So good!<br /><br />(things a man has to do!)<br /><br />

Last time I did it, I quietly walked up to the Walmart customer service desk, took one of the moneygram forms from the holder, filled it out, handed it to the girl along with my cash. She said maybe 5 words to me. And I had my coins by the time I got back home..so convenient. I mean, you do leave the house to get groceries and whatnot occasionally I assume. Just do this the next time youre planning to hot walmart.<br /><br />Yes the dwolla-&gt;MtGox-&gt;wallet method is cheaper, but the whole process takes several business days and of course there&#039;s the whole issue of dwolla having your identity, and the rumors of the Man watching MtGox closely, if you care about that stuff.
