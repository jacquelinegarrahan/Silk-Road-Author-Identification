				Hi,<br /><br />I have a question regarding bit coins. Normally to get them into my account, I use BitInstant (since it&#039;s fast) to deposit it into my Mt. Gox account which is then transferred to SR. The only issue is that Bit Instant takes out a certain percentage of your money and I was wondering if there&#039;s a better way to put money into my account without them taking anything out. I have to order by the end of this week, so any help at all would be nice!<br /><br />Thanks!!!

				If you&#039;re in the States, you can try bitfloor.&nbsp; You can take cash and deposit in their bank account at either Wells Fargo or Chase.&nbsp; There is no charge to deposit money this way and you can purchase coins from them.&nbsp; (Essentially a 0% way to get BTC.)<br /><br />They will have a high-def video of you making the deposit at the bank but as long as you aren&#039;t a serious vendor (in which case you&#039;d be more worried about how to move money the other way anyway) you are fine.&nbsp; (Wear a flower shirt and real big sunglasses like I do.&nbsp; Sure, it doesn&#039;t stop anyone from recogonizing you, but it is an excellent reason to talk to the cute girls behind the counter.)<br /><br />My advice, purchase coins this way and pay the %1.5 - %3.0 for BTC laundry right after.&nbsp; (e.g., TORWallet or blockchain.info.&nbsp; To be clear, I don&#039;t trust either of those two but I have moved a few hundred through them with no problem at all.)<br />

Once the money is in my Bitfloor account, how do I withdraw it? Do I put my SR address for it to be transferred to or do I put in my Mt.Gox account number?

				any other opinions/experience on bitfloor?&nbsp; I kkow they got hacked but right now there are limited options for getting bitcoins from cash and I would transfer the coin out as soon as possible.&nbsp; I like the idea of paying a low commission, although the website isn&#039;t very clear to me on what that fee is.&nbsp; this is what it says right now:<br /><br />Placing orders is free. You are only charged when a trade happens. The amount you are charged is a fixed percentage of the trade volume. In some cases there is no fee and instead you are rebated.<br /><br />Taker Fee: 0.4%<br />Provider Rebate: 0.1%
