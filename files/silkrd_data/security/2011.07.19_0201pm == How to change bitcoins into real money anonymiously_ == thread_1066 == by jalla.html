				Use liberty reserve - it&#039;s the easiest.&nbsp; First run your coins through a tumbler, then mtgox or use another exchange to transfer out to liberty reserve (USD) or Pecunix (gold-backed).&nbsp; Both are anonymous.&nbsp; You can get international Visa, MasterCard, Maestro cards that can be transferred to from pecunix and LR, and just pull the cash out of a debit machine or use the money for whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />This way the tax parasites don&#039;t know it even exists unless they walk into your house and say &#039;hey............. where&#039;d you get ______&#039;.&nbsp; But of course everything else about you is upstanding and squeaky clean so you wouldn&#039;t have a tax parasite in your house, right?

				message some of the vendors on here who are selling $ or £ for bitcoin. Obviously do this from a buyer account and not the one <br />you sell on! If you have a lot to exchange, set up some kind of deal, a certain amount per week, in maybe a few envelopes, you <br />should get it alot cheaper then paying BTC - LR - Debit card (looking at 10% from btc to lr, then another 10% to debit card, and <br />the card costs around 50$, and a 3-10$ fee for cash withdrawal)<br /><br />It depends how much you are wanting to exchange and how you interpret the anonymity of each service

				http://bitlaundry.appspot.com/<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instructions exactly, and write down the number of BTC required BEFORE you click confirm (for whatever reason this doesn&#039;t show up on the final page).&nbsp; If you don&#039;t follow them to the letter your BTC are gone in the wind.<br /><br />But other than that this one is the best as far as volume of transactions and options are concerned.

				Many other threads with this same info and more. Just fyi.<br /><br />Use 20-30 mybitcoin wallets (create new ones regularly) and make daily payments to yourself in random amounts at random times. After 4-5 transactions it is safe to use those coins. I then do the following...<br /><br />Exchange -&gt; LR -&gt; Visa<br />OR<br />Btc2CC<br />OR<br />Exchange for Buy.com giftcard and buy a Visa Gift Card there

				I&#039;ve heard people using the bitcoin wallet (web based) have been ripped off. Thats the main problem with doing it that way... Now, if you have 3 or 4 computers and put tor on each of them and use the computer wallet, that is the way i would go...

				I&#039;ve never lost any funds through MyBitcoin.com (xqzfakpeuvrobvpj.onion) not speaking for others but I have trusted them and they have instant account to account transfers so you are never waiting and hoping.<br />any EU based eWallets out there that are trustworthy? would love to find an alternative

Gox).&nbsp; I think it&#039;s very important that people understand they need to use UNIQUE PASSWORDS at every site, like: SR, SR Forums, OVDB, Mt Gox, TradeHill, any bitcoin pools, safe-mail.net, Hushmail, lavabit, etc. and even at Gmail or Yahoo where you might be using your same board name.&nbsp; <br /><br />Which makes making a strong password worth mentioning: a good brute force hack can take out a password of &quot;sallysmashmike&quot; pretty easily.&nbsp; If you add two *blank spaces* the article I saw (sorry, I didn&#039;t keep the link) said it would take the fastest supercomputer 8 YEARS to break it, as in: sally smash mike.&nbsp; &nbsp;Something very valuable to know!&nbsp; Even places like Gmail let you use blank spaces in passwords nowadays. :D
