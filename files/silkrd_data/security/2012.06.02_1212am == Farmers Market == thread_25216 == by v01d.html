				I just came back from a long absence from SR. Hearing news about FM going down, and just wondering if anyone can elaborate on the specifics? I did a forum search and looks like they were using hushmail and paypal for transactions? Did they use GPG or bitcoins? Was any of the arrests because of a weakness of their servers, or was it all human error? <br />Also, remember GPG, GPG, GPG, and then more GPG.

				Gist of it ...<br /><br />The investigation began about 8 years ago and most vendors were only using Hushmail. Hushmail gave backdoor access which allowed their emails to be viewed.<br /><br />Payments were made via cash, paypal and western union ... all of which was being noted by the feds because they had the emails.<br /><br />No PGP was used until recently which you notice because the evidence pertaining to coded language messages tapers off around the summer of 2011 ( meaning up til then all the messages were being tracked ). <br /><br />Because of Hushmail cooperation it is basically like having a window into a room where a drug deal is going on ... you know who is involved, whats being sold, how much and of what. <br /><br />-AC

So it sounds like SR is still safe as long as you follow protocol.
