				Just wondering, if bitcoins could be counterfeited. I know the math says no but like anything its possible new technology might be able to somehow make a replicated coin and that would crash the market until the issue was sorted.<br /><br />Any tech heads here who can say this is 100% safe?<br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />I have no skills but if I did, would I &#039;forge&#039; bitcoins?<br /><br />Kilos of coke for free?<br /><br />I guess I admit I would if I could. If the coins were undetected and I made a million the BTC market would see a change.<br /><br />The honest side of me says counterfeiting bitcoins would be wrong.<br /><br />But what would you do IF you somehow forged a million BTC.<br /><br />Good weekend that would be.

				nope. not possible. its all based on cryptography and mathematical calculations so not possible to forge.

				I mean btc mining with racks of cards will go through hashes fast. It`ll take a while to recover the initial costs though, I`ve heard many who`ve said its worth it.

				No bitcoins cannot be counterfeit, however stealing them from another s wallet is pretty easy...hence why I never use wallet programs, instawallet ftw ^-^

				Yeah I got that, but how good is it in terms of cost-performance? Like when I build a rig, which one will pay itself off faster? Also how would I go about building a rig with those?
