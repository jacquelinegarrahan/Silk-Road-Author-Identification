				Let me start off by saying I&quot;m sorry if this has been posted numerous times.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure people are sick of helping new users with questions.&nbsp; But I downloaded GPG Keychain Access for Mac and I&#039;m a little lost when it comes to using it/how to encrypt files.&nbsp; I created my own key, imported a seller&#039;s key, but I guess now I&#039;m just wondering how to encrypt messages when I need to send my address information to a seller?

				I had the same issue as you at first. After you copy the public key to your clipboard, go to Edit&gt; paste.

				GPG for Mac makes this pretty easy. Type out your email, then when you get to the part you want to encrypt:<br /><br />- open up a new text file<br />- type in the text you want to encrypt<br />- highlight the text you want to encrypt<br />- Right-click on mouse, go to Services, and then select OpenPGP: Encrypt<br />- A new window will appear. Select the recipient and then select your secret key<br />- Once it&#039;s encrypted, highight the entire encrypted text (including the BEGIN and END lines), copy it to your clipboard, and paste it in the email.<br /><br />

				Make sure you&#039;ve downloaded and installed the GPGTools Installer. (http://www.gpgtools.org/). That will install all of the MacGPG tools. If that&#039;s what you installed you may need to re-install the GPG Services application (I had to install it separately to get it working). It can be found here. (http://www.gpgtools.org/gpgservices/index.html)

				One other important thing:<br /><br />To do the right click functions, such as encrypt / decry you have to go to the &quot;services&quot; menu in system tools or any applications, such as text edit, and select &quot;services&quot;, then you will see many text boxes for varios services that can appear in an application&#039;s right click menu. Scroll through the service slisttill you see the GPG tools functions, and check the boxes next to all the functions.&nbsp; No matter what application you are in, it will enable these services for all applications. Check the boces for encrypt decrypt, import key, verify, and insert my key.<br /><br />Its easy once you get that done. Lesson: You must enable the services under one of the application menus or in system tools. You can get to the services mnu under system tools, keyboard, then hit the top button for keyboard shortcuts. You will see the services icon on the left, and then if you scroll down on the right you will see the GPG functions - just check the boxes. Also in&nbsp; system tools is a GPG mac applet for fixing the installation. It cant hurt, try it after any OSX updates if GPG acts funny.
