				I read safe-mail had some secret code going on a vendor outside of SR. When you hit reply to the emails, if you scroll down in the email address spot for the reply it was also going to the admin of safe-mail along with the person that was suppose to get it.

				So it&#039;s sounding like the consensus is that tormail, while not perfect, is the least of evils? Of course always using PGP is a no brainer, but always bears repeating for those new to the sight that are unaware. More thoughts anyone???
