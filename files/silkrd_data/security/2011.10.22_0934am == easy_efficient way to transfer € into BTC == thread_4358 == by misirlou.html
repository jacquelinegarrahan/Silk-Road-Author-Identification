				Is it possible to deposit funds on a Paxum account or OK PAY account through a creditcard?<br />Or do you know a similar thing that would make that possible?<br />Then I can directly buy BTC on tradehill and transfer them to SR.<br /><br />If that works, that would smoothen things out a bit and cancel the minimum 3day waiting period for a SEPA transfer to complete.

				Ah damn, thats bad news!&nbsp; As you already said...it was already a pain in the ass to deposit funds with euros. It took/takes days! And since at least a week Tradehill is more down than working.<br />&nbsp;I dont have found an alternative either, but deposit funds on a paxum or OK PAY account through a credit card sounds like worth trying. It just sucks for ppl who dont have a creditcard.<br />I&#039;m curious if someone has an trustful alternative too!<br />&nbsp;<br />btw..I didnt get that email from tradehill and was still able to use SEPA wire just a week ago. When did you get that email?

				Got it yesterday.<br />You can check it on their site,if you want to transfer €, the option you&#039;ll get is through paxum and OK PAY.<br />This sucks monkeyballs cause with another party involved more fees is getting stuck on their fingers.<br /><br />This is the mail I got.<br /><br />info (info@tradehill.com) <br /><br />Thanks for using TradeHill!&nbsp; <br />Please take some time to read the following announcements regarding our EUR/BTC deposit and withdraw updates:<br />SEPA account changes<br />We are currently in the process of changing SEPA accounts, as our current EUR partner has decided to refocus his business. We would like to thank our partner for the invaluable help he has given to TradeHill to establish our EUR/BTC market and wish him success in his next venture.<br />We expect this transition to our new SEPA account to take several weeks to complete. In the mean time, EUR deposit and withdrawal will be available via Paxum account or OK PAY account. Please do not send SEPA deposits to the former account, as it will be rejected by the account.<br />We will keep you updated on the blog with any updates about this status.<br /><br />If you currently having a pending SEPA deposit and have not sent this, please do not submit this transfer. You can choose to fund your account using one of the methods mentioned above, or wait until we have made full migration to the other account!<br />OK PAY<br />We are accepting OK PAY for USD and EUR deposits and withdrawals.

				Ever tried MtGox? They also exchange Euro and its possible to do a international wire.<br />I havent tried it before, always used tradehill for deposit and withdraw funds, but its not possible to get a OKPAY account yet and when you sign up for a PAXUM acount, PAXUM asks you for a lot of personal information and to comfirm your ID and adress by sending them a copy of your bank account, etc. It doesnt feel safe anymore.<br /><br />Anyway...ever tried MtGox for €?<br />:)
