				Let&#039;s assume that mining is out of the question. What steps to take to purchase bitcoins at the highest level of anonymity? <br /><br />My first idea is to withdraw cash from my ATM, drive to the other side of the large city I live in and purchase a pre-paid debit card with the cash. Using Tor, I will open a fake email account which I will then use to open a fake account at a bitcoin exchange. I will load USD on the exchange with my pre-paid debit card, buy bitcoins and send them to my wallet. <br /><br />Will this work, at all? How can I improve my method?

				I don&#039;t know of any exchanges that take credit or debit cards. You may be able to find someone on the bitcoin forums willing to exchange green dot money packs for btc. I know there is a guy that sells prepaid cards for btc maybe he would do it the other way around. He also does LR so if you have a liberty reserve account maybe he will deal with you as well.

				The best way to do this is to find a dealer on Localbitcoins.com like this one I have used<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/22396/purchase-bitcoin-cash-deposit-chase-bank-united-states<br /><br />this one for examples, you can, during Chase business hours, go to your nearest branch and follow his instructions...you make an anonymous cash deposit...no dealing with anyone, never using your ID at any time if you do not want to.&nbsp; The money stays in escrow until the deed is done, the whole process takes 10-15 minutes, depending on how close your nearest Chase is.&nbsp; There are also ones for B of A and other banks.<br /><br />cheers!

				I would say localbitcoins with a cash meetup is better.&nbsp; You can create an account using tor and only communicate using tor.&nbsp; Some sellers block tor and require certain verifications like phone, but I doubt most do.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d rather have some random guy see my face once a week than a bank camera.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though outside of densely populated areas you probably won&#039;t find anyone selling locally so the bank may the only option.<br /><br />But in that case, maybe it&#039;d make just as much sense to open an account with an exchange and buy bitcoins there and send them through bitcoinfog to anonymize them a bit.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably end up paying less of a premium that way too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess it depends on whether you want to hide the fact that you&#039;re buying bitcoins, or simply hide where they end up.<br /><br />

				I was wondering why the fuck OP even bothered acting like mining was a realistic option for anyone to get BTC.<br /><br />2011. GOT IT. <br /><br />Why the fuck was this dug up?
