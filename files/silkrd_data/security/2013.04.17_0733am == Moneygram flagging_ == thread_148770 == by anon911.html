				I have a friend who just got a job at a gas station and in one of the training videos he said that employees are supposed to write down the information of people using Moneygram who look suspicious or are sending more than $500 for law enforcement. He also said that they told him that the company ZipZap (what Bitinstant uses) was flagged there as well and was told to write down the information of people sending money to them for law enforcement. What do you think about this?

				Interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read all of money grams procedures including their profiling and money laundering procedures.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about what you speak of but I could find the pdf detailing all their procedures and what forms they must fill out and when.&nbsp; They don&#039;t just &quot;write down names&quot;.&nbsp; The procedure includes filing out forms and saving the surveillance footage.

				Eh they&#039;re probably looking for fraud. Moneygram had to pay 100M in some suit involving fraud a while back if I recall. ZipZap is an even larger international company too so I wouldn&#039;t jump to any conclusions just yet.

				This practice is most likely location-specific to areas with high risk of fraud. At my local place it is an absolute pain in the ass to get bitinstant transactions done because nobody has heard of ZipZap or even Moneygram bill pay before and they are relieved to finish up and get me out the door.
