				i was just curious as to if this has happened to any other SR members, and what exactly I should do about it. i ordered a little over $1000 through a cash deposit at a bank in 2 separate but equal deposits in order to comply with bitinstant&#039;s limits. both deposits were at the same bank, and at both deposits I made sure my change was exact and the account number correct. after a few hours of waiting, I received a few BTC, but it was ~$20 less than what I should be receiving from only one deposit after fees. (i have not received any of the BTC for the second deposit yet) The rest of the BTC have yet to be seen. <br /><br />I have tracked the QuoteIDs, and both of the deposits say that the funds have been received, and both of them are sending the BTC to the correct address. I emailed support, but they have yet to respond yet.<br /><br />Am I going to get my BTC by tomorrow morning, if at all? And if so, do you guys think I can get my fees waived because of the length of time the delivery took?

				As far as if you can get your fees waived because of the delay, not sure. But I&#039;m pretty sure I read on here about Bitinstant transactions lasting that long. I&#039;m sure you will end up getting your coins. If they are not there by tomorrow morning, I would definitely be e-mailing them or contacting them somehow! They never responded to my e-mail to their support. Good luck man!

				It may just take a while sue to the high number of deposited money. Depending where you are receiving it could just be mixing them around to try and anonymize them more. Since its a higher volume. Im assuming higher wait time.
