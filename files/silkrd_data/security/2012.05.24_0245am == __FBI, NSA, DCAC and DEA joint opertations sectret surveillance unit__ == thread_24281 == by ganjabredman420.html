				I am not surprised to see no mention of NSA. Although certainly unfortunate news it is to be expected. Law enforcement are currently operating largely in the past, modern technological advancements are fucking their ability to carry out surveillance. This unit will likely be focusing on developing zero day exploits to by pass proxies and encryption. Remember, you can have unbreakable encryption and be behind a billion mixes and it doesn&#039;t mean shit if the FBI roots you. This is the type of technique they are going to be forced to use if they want to be able to intercept any data once the point comes that essentially all communications are encrypted. <br /><br />You can perfectly counter their ability to perform a remote intercept of communications by using airgaps. The best airgap is simple, you download encrypted messages on a machine connected to the internet, then you type the ciphertext over by hand to a machine that is not connected to the internet. You could also burn the ciphertexts to a one time use CD to transfer them to the machine not connected to the internet, but you will need to type messages you encrypt into the machine that is connected to the internet or else the airgap will be broken. ECC will be nicer than RSA, the following key has the security parameters of a 15,000+ bit RSA key but is obviously much smaller<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----<br />MIGbMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBSuBBAAjA4GGAAQBmnrL42AZNRYiEfspsY0KUaYqD5CS<br />B92lMtm5J/XkqCaOuTihy1qhIf0vMNTW0XAFybJQ6N0RYzNoXQonPmeCnNIBV2ox<br />XmELJk3ZCphttb4yl+1n9swIplnFAIzt5aJQ/wP8ZVm0aUPC70Yl9ql5+su2N6oS<br />e8bNTcoYoRq4T58heVg=<br />-----END PUBLIC KEY-----<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>it produces ciphertexts that are much smaller also (it is also much faster), so easier to type things across with airgaps. Using airgaps prevents 100% of pure hacking based intercept technology, and that is the sort of shit the FBI is probably developing with this unit.<br /><br />ciphertext of the above sentence with 256 bit symmetric and (what is equal to) 16k bit RSA security:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MIGbMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBSuBBAAjA4GGAAQAa/hNYXvgZjpra1WKiJ6b/RuCjKDk<br />0HfaMXyzZmrp7RpB8fvkL2juNRjpAeaypxtwS36Q+QpT90lB37L5ZwlQgt0BY06j<br />mClDoTgqunJ1kGJNL5zzQ7tOrh4VQB3SsX4WVb0pYQIXsT0BgOY8dggKtZvSKJUh<br />Cqe1CZjD3IeOmVdtQTQ=6DtmhEdsf91yIhrS9ylNVX9Q42WkNOoIJejKc+/drdrY93<br />mULRJOSDZYo6Y9fsnkftBbtXJMyXgFBfguJl0V9P7tVpuxdQPMOWvi56SWKY<br />O8RHNz9j7DeHtG0CFZJcKCepT0EEe/UtGwUMC2/mqVo/P8DHn4l+pRaJOrkSfbX25<br />PsiBJMiHQeycXMn0mWpqhC/L8i6kaFj4cSPuyLgTzQQ1w8C3tL8azcEo1ZwPN<br />lBjqG0gmU2U9Nq91pyWz9QiCigKdg2UHaMkAYQtG8lqt4K8pNbfpxLnLspWPV<br />2PAmM5EBWYDWQQ2lokLcyxUHtjN9FtofzLuS77/h5RB4meBgvJrLv4OkCtpexYUF7IE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />here it is with GPG default equal security parameters<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />ME4wEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFZysBBAwDOgAEb/149f4sGZWr01HDDOpG0y0aJPz8i7RC<br />3Nx5bJe0BgpzEGEU7AZXxaz8XxzORW0EQB6pdjFJE+I=WLjxfdXZjFT9n7xfGPcNL<br />XhcJHOeiwggfOTesT9RZ/8JxKhOdUrF+DtNWcrP4ZtU/mxDsDqSO4ASCSG/<br />Mc4+VHuMOOPzIgqm5M6FsRd1o3nXHLIqGHjc47F5M/+U6eAs366JErdf3ac3oOXbs<br />AG8i8cniMoCQw2q6c7MB4GImNNK579GPHGIuGqcGtdgdtZJoZnbSBzCBNbw5<br />N4rd8nNyRioPS7+du05DVTqq16VJgFhGC7VqfDTUA20YwBj84yZzoCQjqfnR1Bwg<br />PFJ59eXMfFRJ2nYUchp3HnL4EIF7yyRW4pHBEQDJli0gTYQGPOt3e0lZ<br />4v3eu5x2mmQNTroaFhgWkJO+ieM24jAdHHk<br /><br />and 2,048 bit RSA key strength equivalent public key<br /><br />-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----<br />ME4wEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFZysBBAwDOgAEb/149f4sGZWr01HDDOpG0y0aJPz8i7RC<br />3Nx5bJe0BgpzEGEU7AZXxaz8XxzORW0EQB6pdjFJE+I=<br />-----END PUBLIC KEY-----<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The other thing to worry about is them hacking you and discovering your IP address. Then they can get your plaintexts also, potentially with local TEMPEST or other fancy &#039;keylogging&#039; technology. The best bet against FBI being able to deanonymize you by hacking is to use hardware based isolation techniques, run Tor on one machine (it can be cheap as hell) with a connection to the internet. This machine should be a very minimalist installation of a very secure OS, I would suggest OpenBSD. You then connect to the Tor machine with the machine that you use for browsing the web, and it forwards all the traffic it gets on to Tor and returns the reply. Now if your browser machine is rooted the attacker can still be prevented from getting your real IP address unless they can also pwn Tor running on a minimalist OpenBSD box, of course with full ASLR. I believe you can even isolate Tor with software techniques and make it so even if Tor is compromised the attacker can not get your real IP address unless they break the isolation (I have heard others talk of this technique but never implemented it myself), although they will always be able to trace you to your entry guards in this case. You will also need to use firewall rules to prevent them from just switching to entry guards they own to get your real IP address. Not the best to be traced to your entry guards, but essentially the same security as provided by a hidden service so maybe not so bad. <br /><br />Airgaps + hardware isolation with security oriented operating systems will give the FBI a run for their money, NSA would still cut through it though.

				Ashame every honest vender and buyer here at SR&nbsp; could not possess the knowledge of kevin mitnick. The feds were after him and he hacked into the feds computer and started fucking with them. One agent who was after him&nbsp; bad kevin hacked the electric company and had the fbi agents electricity shut off haha. Then sent him a nice little note laughing at him. If anyone has not watched the kevin mitnick story go to youtube and watch it. amazing guy. Funny when he got out of prison the united states government hired them as their security guy lol. <br /><br />I try and not worry much about getting busted cause all I get is very small orders and nothing really heavy and i no nobdy who is a big time buyer/seller in real life. I am just a loser who lives at home plays video games plays guitar and watches&nbsp; star wars a lot lol.If i was a LEO i would be embarrassed to make a bust on someone small and actually present the case to a DA and go before a judge. The judge would likely get pissed. I had a friend who actually fights the cops for every little thing. He has taken the police department to court 3 times and won each time&nbsp; and each time his attorney said he needs to accept the deal being offered. I think many times attorneys are in with the cops and or the lawyer wants to make his quick thousand knowing that if it keeps going on and on he is going to have to ACTUALLY WORK so the lawyer recommends what is best for him to just get paid and get it over with. He has it to where the local cops&nbsp; act like they are scared to even pull him over cause they know if they don&#039;t go exactly by the book he will go to professional standards and file a complaint lol.&nbsp; I make it a point to know my rights too. i have had friends who were cops with high connections and they always told me know your rights and the laws in the jurisdiction that way&nbsp; if a cop ever tries to fuck with you&nbsp; you can turn the tables and if you have a camera on your phone make sure when a cop approaches you&nbsp; you turn it on and let him know you are recording that&nbsp; engagement. I was physically threatened one night by this thug&nbsp; chic. I was like 23 and she was 16 she was at work and I tried to ignore it but when she said when her bf gets their they are doing this and doing that I said ok let&#039;s do this the LAW way. A cop was standing against the wall this was a theater and I told him that I wanted her arrested for assault. Most people think assault means you have to actually touch someone. Not the case. you can just draw your fist back at someone and that by the LAW in my state anyways and many others is considered assault when someone actually touches you/hits you that is battery. AKA. assault and battery. So the cop did not even know the laws as well as I did or he was too lazy to do anything at that time cause believe it or not some cops have a I dont give a fuck attitude and I dont want to be bothered with paper work and going downtown booking someone. thats why u should always kiss ass cause being a jerk will make them get pleasure driving your ass to jail&nbsp; but he said what she did was not assault so I went on to tell him I go to the library every day to study the statues and yes indeed it is if you do not believe me call a supervisor on the scene haha he changed his tone then. an officer hates it if you request a supervisor be called to the scene which you can request to be done cause if they fucked uop and did not follow procedure the supervisor will log it cause at that point its the officers ass&nbsp; getting a bad mark or the supervisor for hiding it.&nbsp; So after I had this girl sweating bullets thinking she was going to be taken to juvi jail for the night I told the officer look. let her go home but since she is underage I cant get her to release her info to me so file a complaint downtown and take this to court...going through my spills of hey cop I know my shit.so I said have her release her information to you and then you release it to Me and I will go through proper channels. she called her parents and thy came and talked to the cops and the cop was like this guy is going overboard and taking this too far. I didnt give a shit about the girl or her threats I was just trying to show her hey you dont go around threatening people with violence&nbsp; this is the real world not new jack city. Anyways her parents took her home and end of the night. go to your library folks and find out your rights and laws of your town as they differ from place to place. I m always nice and respectful to policemen all I want is them to be the same to me if they suspect I use drugs or not. Just treat me like you want to be treated. True though especially early on fri or sat nights in clubs where cops are hanging out in uniform and want to stay and talk to girls. i was drunk as shit one night even fell flat on my ass&nbsp; trying to unlock my car door with my keys. the cop helps me up Im like fuck im going to jail he walks me out front to a cab and says come get your car tomorrow. there was more hot women around than you can shake a stick at. you know whats up with that. Another time I got pulled over supper drunk. Something i regret cause I hate drunk driving and have not done so in years. Just started yanking at my heart seeing young pretty teenage girls killed by drunk drivers and their parents grieving so I said I would never put my self in that position but he pulled me over at 4 am on a sat no one was around. he approaches and ask if i been drinking and guys if they ever ask you that even if u are shit faced drunk like I was always say NO. cuase if you even say yeah I had one beer 5 hrs ago by law they have got to test you and can get ya&nbsp; if you say No Sir haven&#039;t had a drop in 2 weeks it is their discretion if they want to take this any further or just say go home. Well he asked if I had car insurance which i did but expired the day before i was so drunk when i opened the glove compartment&nbsp; i spill everything in it and Im slurring really bad. Im like here&nbsp; Im sorry my car is such a mess its embarrassing haha. anything to maybe change the thought of the moment from should i arrest and test this guy to maybe make him laugh and say what an idiot just get out of here.&nbsp; he wrote me a citation for expired insurance and sent me on my way. he knew I was drunk as fuck and probably at the end of his shift or he knew all the bars just closed and wanted to hit the hang outs near their for hotties. anyways. learn the laws friendd be nice to cops they are not idiots. many iof not most are ass holes but not all. many are just good people like me or you who just want to do what they think is the right thing. others are just sadist who enjoys fucking with people. the hiring regulations need to be higher. More brains and less brawn needed. cops dont need the high school football players mentality they need peter parker/reed richerds mentalities.
