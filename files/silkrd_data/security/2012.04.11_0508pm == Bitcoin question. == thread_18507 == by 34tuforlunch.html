What&#039;s to stop them from inviting you to a secluded area and just mugging you of your money? CL is well known for this. No reason they can&#039;t meet you at starbucks and xfer with their phone and/or laptop while you&#039;re right in front of them holding the cash.<br /><br />You can send right to the site if it&#039;s a small amount and you are just buying.<br />Better if your wallet first, then here

When you showed up to the apartment they had broken into three guy&#039;s rearranged your face with a tire iron and made off with all the cash you brought to buy the items. Probably is just a 16yr old kid but never underestimate the motivation of petty scammers and crackheads :)<br /><br />Also wouldn&#039;t directly xfer here, site is down.
