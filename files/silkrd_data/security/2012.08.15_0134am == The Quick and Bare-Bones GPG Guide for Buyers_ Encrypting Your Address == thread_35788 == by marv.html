				This guide will show you how to encrypt your address when making a purchase. Most casual buyers will not require an understanding of GPG encryption beyond the need to encrypt your address when making a purchase. <br /><br />After following this tutorial, you will be able to quickly encrypt your address and enjoy greater peace of mind. You won&#039;t believe how easy this will be. <br /><br />Follow these steps slowly and with peace in your heart. This is very easy to do and everyone reading this can do it. Take as much time as you need. <br /><br />FIRST, go here and hit the big, green download button: http://www.gpg4win.org/<br /><br />Install it and remember the folder where it was installed.<br /><br />Go to the folder where it was installed and double-click &#039;gpa&#039;.<br /><br />NOW you&#039;re in business. <br /><br />NEXT, go to your vendor&#039;s page and find his PUBLIC KEY; copy his PUBLIC KEY. <br /><br />OPEN notepad on your computer.<br /><br />PASTE the vendor&#039;s PUBLIC KEY in the notepad. Save it as &quot;HOTSTUFF&quot;; save this on your desktop.<br /><br />GO BACK to gpa. Click IMPORT. <br /><br />SELECT the HOTSTUFF.txt file from your desktop.<br /><br />Click on CLIPBOARD.<br /><br />A clipboard will open up. <br /><br />TYPE your address. <br /><br />CLICK ENCRYPT. <br /><br />A menu will come up and you will see the PUBLIC KEY you just imported. Select this PUBLIC KEY. <br /><br />Click OK.<br /><br />Now your CLIPBOARD will be filled with funny letters. <br /><br />COPY ALL THE FUNNY LETTERS AND SYMBOLS. <br /><br />THIS IS YOUR ADDRESS, ENCRYPTED.<br /><br />PASTE THE ENCRYPTED ADDRESS INTO THE ADDRESS FIELD WHEN YOU ARE MAKING THE PURCHASE WITH THAT VENDOR.<br /><br />NOW YOU CAN SLEEP JUST A LITTLE EASIER. BUT I RECOMMEND YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS. <br /><br />THIS IS A GREAT START.<br /><br />marv<br /><br />note: if anyone will suggest modifications to this guide to make the process even smoother and more accurate, please let us know.

				First of all my apologies for the complete noob question..<br /><br />I am on a mac trying to use GPG Tools to encrypt my info. I can follow the steps listed up until where I need to open the clipboard, there is no clipboard in GPG Tools. I&#039;ve played around with it for a while and even watched the tutorial, yet I still cant figure it out. <br /><br />Can anyone help me out?

				I might be wrong... But I think Text Edit is all you need. Give it a try! I&#039;m just figuring it out as well! I just can&#039;t Find my public key. I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m going to export my private key. Anybody got the answer? My thread on the bottom of the page has all the deets (short) about what my keys are labeled as- None of them are Pub.
