				I just sent them a raging email demanding that they unlock my account and how ridiculous this was....In the mean time, is there any other way to buy BTC....or do they have a fucking monopoly on the BTC transactions?<br /><br />This is pissing me off so bad....there is no way in hell I am sending them a scanned picture of my ID......isn&#039;t the fact that they made deposits into my bank account enough I MEAN WTF&gt;

				I used exchangebitcoins.com this week and went from cash to BTC in a matter of hours.<br /><br />Basically goes like this:<br />1. Sign up and make a deposit reservation for the amount to be spent<br />2. Walk in a local bank and deposit cash w/ deposit slip (Website explains what to write on slip)<br />3. Send picture of receipt<br />4. Couple hours later you are ready to purchase bitcoins<br /><br />I did this all on my mobile phone and my cash was available on the website in under 2 hours.

I think Western Union is like $.50 or something which is twice the price of Dwolla however I have also heard it is faster process to convert to BTC. I haven&#039;t used it though but there&#039;s no way I am giving Dwolla an ID. I think as a company they aren&#039;t totally trustworthy.

				First off, i definitely wouldnt send a photo id to them of course. if for some reason it DOES become the best option for you, rest at ease knowing that all the other information u have already supplied to them is just as likely to hold up in court for THEM as a photo id. it is CLEARLY legally your account already. of course this doesnt matter because presumably you are already killing the paper trail via a coin lauderer or wutever, but i would say the risk is almost exactly the same with or without the photo. still think its weird that they specifically asked for one. would u mind telling us why they mightve made an exception with you?&nbsp; ~smod

				Dwolla has your bank account. What more do they need if they come at you via Dwolla? DNA?<br /><br />Probably just a scam email. Or worse, LE sending it out and watching how many people check in to see if it&#039;s true.
