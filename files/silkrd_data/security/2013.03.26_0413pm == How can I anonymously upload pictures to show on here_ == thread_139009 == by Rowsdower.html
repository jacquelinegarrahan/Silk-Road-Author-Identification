				Onion image uploader seems to have been hacked as it no longer works and is just full of images saying it&#039;s been closed by Dutch police because of child porn.&nbsp; If it was used for child porn, then I suppose it&#039;s good it was shut down, but now I have no idea how to anonymously upload weed pictures on here for example?&nbsp; Which site or service would you recommend for posting drugs pictures through TOR?

				Haha looks like some angry pedophile gave me -1 karma for making this thread!&nbsp; This place cracks me up sometimes... but seriously if anyone knows an alternative similar to onion image uploader for uploading photos of drugs for review purposes, etc. then please post here and let me know!&nbsp; I will give you +1 karma.&nbsp; Apparently child molesters like to give neg karma, you learn something every day eh?

				No need to be embarrassed. It&#039;s not really that hard, all you need is the right program.&nbsp; There&#039;s a program called Stripper that works but every time I use it it seems to downgrade the image. Not sure if I have the settings wrong or what. I also found another one called Batch Purifier. It&#039;s not a total freebie like Stripper but the free version only works on jpgs, great! I haven&#039;t really used it to say for sure it works but I plan on checking it out. I&#039;m sure there are other ways but those are two right quick to get you started. Hope this helps.

				1. For photos I see no real reason why you need to upload them to a hidden service. So long as you upload through the Tor network it shouldn&#039;t matter (so long as you don&#039;t need them up for months and months, which most people do not). Unless of course the filternet site you&#039;re using requires Java or JavaScript to upload, but most don&#039;t or have a basic upload option. I would recommend turning off JavaScript as a matter of principal. Ok, you got some extra shiny features as a trade off in return for another attack vector. Seems like a simple decision to make.<br /><br />2. Meta data in your images, as the others have said. EXIF strippers are everywhere online, just use them and then analyze the output images with a metadata editor/viewer to verify results.<br /><br />3. Never, ever use a mobile &#039;smart&#039; phone camera. Those things can embed your GPS location into the image. With smartphones the creepy factor starts high and gets worse the more you find out about them.<br /><br />4. You should buy, with cash, a Darknet camera, i.e. just a regular digital camera that you exclusively use for SR. The FBI has a program which can identity images and link them to a camera even without metadata. Each camera has a unique fingerprint due to slight imperfections in the camera lens build and dozens of other technical camera factors. The net result is that if you take photos of yourself for Facebook and also for your weed grow-op to upload to SR, you can potentially be identified this way.<br /><br />I would bet my burrow that if not now, that in the very near future all digital photographs uploaded to social networking sites and popular image upload facilities like Flickr, shall be IDed by their unique fingerprints, these unique fingerprints linked to credit card transactions and so to RL identities. Even if they don&#039;t do that, 99 times out of a hundred once you have the camera people use for their Facebook accounts, it&#039;s all over.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Philosophical pine:<br /><br />This may sound paranoid to you, but in the future services may exist like facebook alias accounts, whereby a bot acts and talks like you on Facebook while the real you is elsewhere. I mean, you have to wonder why some services exist online that demand you enter a capcha for routine activities when the threshold for creating an account in the first place includes things like validating a mobile phone or bank account, things which a bot couldn&#039;t do in the first place. I think in terms of the impact of paranoia on society, the future will make the Cold War look like a picnic.<br /><br />In the future where privacy is non-existent, Anonymity = Power.<br /><br />Because what is power when you get right down to it? It&#039;s just having more options than *other people*. The great irony is that the instinctive anti-crime impetus that encourages surveillance technology ultimately leads to two small groups in society that have the ability to kill almost anybody without any repercussions whatsoever. You got the people who control the surveillance systems, they have the ability to delete and reform history in real time, often in a subtle way by merely being selective e.g. Take note of how intelligence services in France have no qualms handing over American corporate trade secrets to their French competitors. Power flows directly to the information aggregators and those best skilled as understanding and disseminating it, it always has done, only now it is very very obvious. <br /><br />Then you got the people who long understood this and evolved due to their environment or predilection, the hackers, the drug vendors, the pedophiles, conspiracy theorists, terrorists, spies and intelligence agents. And I would argue, in a basic sort of way, your children too. Because this is the new world they&#039;re growing up in and they&#039;ve adapted, they expect to be under surveillance. Daddy monitors their web surfing, and Mommy monitors their location via some tablet app to assuage late night curfew anxiety. The result is similar instincts to the innate paranoia of the drug smuggler or hacker, as moronic as that sounds at first. Indeed, the methods of those black market entrepreneurs become objects of admiration, creating a ready market for tradecraft education.<br /><br />In the future, underground wars will be fought and almost nobody in the system outside of the Darknet intelligentsia shall understand what the fuck is going on. I do not applaud this, fascinating in a macabre way though the subject is, because it creates a world of unusual cruelty, where warfare is both arbitrary and permanent due to a low burn rate between participants. There are parallels between Permawar and the vendetta lifestyle.<br /><br />Today&#039;s soldiers, in their uniforms and their units, are as ridiculous a sight as Prussian cavalry charging into battle against the machine gun.<br />What is the point of &quot;winning over the locals&quot; when just 1 spotter with sympathies to Darknet Faction #8 informs that faction&#039;s drone commander to plot a bomb&#039;s course straight into your unit? A flying bomb that incidentally could also have been manufactured within that region within an hour of the unit&#039;s arrival using sophisticated 3D printing techniques and common household materials. What is the point of suppressing that region, when that will only accumulate more adherents to Faction #8? Either you kill everybody, or you move on, toothless. Since ultimately any number of information technology devices in the vicinity could have alerted Faction #8, the ultimate conclusion you have to come to, is that modern armies are not fucking modern. They are fucking archaic. There is more intelligence in the IED than the Leopard 2 tank. At the end of the day when fighting a conventional foe, a $20 IED delivers a better ROI than the illusion of strength in the tank. Spainish Galleons impress me too. But I wouldn&#039;t go to war with one.<br /><br />The result is that Mao&#039;s &quot;People&#039;s War&quot; applies more to today&#039;s world, the nexus of geography, cypherspace and ideological inclination than ever before. Any centralization becomes a weakness. That is why there is absolutely nothing crazy about the ambitions of the cypherpunks and market anarchists. &quot;Parliamentary Democracy&quot; was a fresh, weird idea in 1900, with only a handful of adherents among the world&#039;s countries. As then so today. The only weird idea is that we&#039;ll still have our current system of governance in 2100. That is truly crazy. The current suppression* of legitimate political discourse outside of tightly defined &#039;channels&#039; actually opens up huge ideological arbitrage opportunities for us. For example, SR and Bitcoin are inherently right wing or pro-capitalist institutions but due to their sphere of influence they can massively impact a much larger base of young to middle aged people with mildly left wing sympathies. Thus there is plenty of space for a Compact, an ideological alliance to an end. I don&#039;t know the future but this is what I&#039;m seeing.<br /><br />* &quot;Suppression&quot; may sound over the top, but it is really a matter of relativity**. Even a serf is free in comparison to a slave. You see, once upon a time our current two party system was the height of liberalism, astronomically superior to the rule of kings. But the channels for information transfer and influence have dramatically changed e.g. the emergence of corporations in the previous century, creating power blocks with no national identities, or the emergence of media through the world wide web without the &#039;brakes&#039; that exist for newspapers and television broadcasts. In short, due to technology and economics there exists far more room for collective feedback mechanisms than existed before. When you think on it, the idea of voting in people every couple of years is a structure that has become more cage-like over time, constraining and arbitrary rather than liberating. Why every four or five years do we switch power? Why not 3.5 years? Or six? Term limits existed to prevent imbalances of power but now seem to practically cultivate a stale Party Line when the population has long since changed their minds on the subject in question e.g. Drug War, War on Terror. There is an immense well of potential energy building up underneath the conventional system of democracy and republicanism. Like it or not, the Darknet is at the bleeding edge of politics. Who has a better impact on reforming drug policy in America? I&#039;m sure Obama has more classical leverage, but in the long term it has to be the darknet free markets.<br /><br />** In the future pine will have shorter footnotes, albeit this may be one of my more utopian visions.

The current suppression* of legitimate political discourse outside of tightly defined &#039;channels&#039; actually opens up huge ideological arbitrage opportunities for us. For example, SR and Bitcoin are inherently right wing or pro-capitalist institutions but due to their sphere of influence they can massively impact a much larger base of young to middle aged people with mildly left wing sympathies. Thus there is plenty of space for a Compact, an ideological alliance to an end. I don&#039;t know the future but this is what I&#039;m seeing.<br /><br />* &quot;Suppression&quot; may sound over the top, but it is really a matter of relativity**. Even a serf is free in comparison to a slave. You see, once upon a time our current two party system was the height of liberalism, astronomically superior to the rule of kings. But the channels for information transfer and influence have dramatically changed e.g. the emergence of corporations in the previous century, creating power blocks with no national identities, or the emergence of media through the world wide web without the &#039;brakes&#039; that exist for newspapers and television broadcasts. In short, due to technology and economics there exists far more room for collective feedback mechanisms than existed before. When you think on it, the idea of voting in people every couple of years is a structure that has become more cage-like over time, constraining and arbitrary rather than liberating. Why every four or five years do we switch power? Why not 3.5 years? Or six? Term limits existed to prevent imbalances of power but now seem to practically cultivate a stale Party Line when the population has long since changed their minds on the subject in question e.g. Drug War, War on Terror. There is an immense well of potential energy building up underneath the conventional system of democracy and republicanism. Like it or not, the Darknet is at the bleeding edge of politics. Who has a better impact on reforming drug policy in America? I&#039;m sure Obama has more classical leverage, but in the long term it has to be the darknet free markets.<br /><br />** In the future pine will have shorter footnotes, albeit this may be one of my more utopian visions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I second this.

For photos I see no real reason why you need to upload them to a hidden service. So long as you upload through the Tor network it shouldn&#039;t matter (so long as you don&#039;t need them up for months and months, which most people do not). Unless of course the filternet site you&#039;re using requires Java or JavaScript to upload, but most don&#039;t or have a basic upload option. I would recommend turning off JavaScript as a matter of principal. Ok, you got some extra shiny features as a trade off in return for another attack vector. Seems like a simple decision to make.<br /><br />2. Meta data in your images, as the others have said. EXIF strippers are everywhere online, just use them and then analyze the output images with a metadata editor/viewer to verify results.<br /><br />3. Never, ever use a mobile &#039;smart&#039; phone camera. Those things can embed your GPS location into the image. With smartphones the creepy factor starts high and gets worse the more you find out about them.<br /><br />4. You should buy, with cash, a Darknet camera, i.e. just a regular digital camera that you exclusively use for SR. The FBI has a program which can identity images and link them to a camera even without metadata. Each camera has a unique fingerprint due to slight imperfections in the camera lens build and dozens of other technical camera factors. The net result is that if you take photos of yourself for Facebook and also for your weed grow-op to upload to SR, you can potentially be identified this way.<br /><br />I would bet my burrow that if not now, that in the very near future all digital photographs uploaded to social networking sites and popular image upload facilities like Flickr, shall be IDed by their unique fingerprints, these unique fingerprints linked to credit card transactions and so to RL identities. Even if they don&#039;t do that, 99 times out of a hundred once you have the camera people use for their Facebook accounts, it&#039;s all over.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Philosophical pine:<br /><br />This may sound paranoid to you, but in the future services may exist like facebook alias accounts, whereby a bot acts and talks like you on Facebook while the real you is elsewhere. I mean, you have to wonder why some services exist online that demand you enter a capcha for routine activities when the threshold for creating an account in the first place includes things like validating a mobile phone or bank account, things which a bot couldn&#039;t do in the first place. I think in terms of the impact of paranoia on society, the future will make the Cold War look like a picnic.<br /><br />In the future where privacy is non-existent, Anonymity = Power.<br /><br />Because what is power when you get right down to it? It&#039;s just having more options than *other people*. The great irony is that the instinctive anti-crime impetus that encourages surveillance technology ultimately leads to two small groups in society that have the ability to kill almost anybody without any repercussions whatsoever. You got the people who control the surveillance systems, they have the ability to delete and reform history in real time, often in a subtle way by merely being selective e.g. Take note of how intelligence services in France have no qualms handing over American corporate trade secrets to their French competitors. Power flows directly to the information aggregators and those best skilled as understanding and disseminating it, it always has done, only now it is very very obvious. <br /><br />Then you got the people who long understood this and evolved due to their environment or predilection, the hackers, the drug vendors, the pedophiles, conspiracy theorists, terrorists, spies and intelligence agents. And I would argue, in a basic sort of way, your children too. Because this is the new world they&#039;re growing up in and they&#039;ve adapted, they expect to be under surveillance. Daddy monitors their web surfing, and Mommy monitors their location via some tablet app to assuage late night curfew anxiety. The result is similar instincts to the innate paranoia of the drug smuggler or hacker, as moronic as that sounds at first. Indeed, the methods of those black market entrepreneurs become objects of admiration, creating a ready market for tradecraft education.<br /><br />In the future, underground wars will be fought and almost nobody in the system outside of the Darknet intelligentsia shall understand what the fuck is going on. I do not applaud this, fascinating in a macabre way though the subject is, because it creates a world of unusual cruelty, where warfare is both arbitrary and permanent due to a low burn rate between participants. There are parallels between Permawar and the vendetta lifestyle.<br /><br />Today&#039;s soldiers, in their uniforms and their units, are as ridiculous a sight as Prussian cavalry charging into battle against the machine gun.<br />What is the point of &quot;winning over the locals&quot; when just 1 spotter with sympathies to Darknet Faction #8 informs that faction&#039;s drone commander to plot a bomb&#039;s course straight into your unit? A flying bomb that incidentally could also have been manufactured within that region within an hour of the unit&#039;s arrival using sophisticated 3D printing techniques and common household materials. What is the point of suppressing that region, when that will only accumulate more adherents to Faction #8? Either you kill everybody, or you move on, toothless. Since ultimately any number of information technology devices in the vicinity could have alerted Faction #8, the ultimate conclusion you have to come to, is that modern armies are not fucking modern. They are fucking archaic. There is more intelligence in the IED than the Leopard 2 tank. At the end of the day when fighting a conventional foe, a $20 IED delivers a better ROI than the illusion of strength in the tank. Spainish Galleons impress me too. But I wouldn&#039;t go to war with one.<br /><br />The result is that Mao&#039;s &quot;People&#039;s War&quot; applies more to today&#039;s world, the nexus of geography, cypherspace and ideological inclination than ever before. Any centralization becomes a weakness. That is why there is absolutely nothing crazy about the ambitions of the cypherpunks and market anarchists. &quot;Parliamentary Democracy&quot; was a fresh, weird idea in 1900, with only a handful of adherents among the world&#039;s countries.
