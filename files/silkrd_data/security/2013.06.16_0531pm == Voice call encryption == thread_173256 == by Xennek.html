				Anyone use VoIP or cell phone encryption? Please share your links to apps that enable secure calls. I know Silent Circle (created by the PGP founder) offers a service for iOS and android but it is $10-20 a month. Free is better.

				i wonder if those android app based voice encryption jobs are built with back doors? i contacted cellcrypt,silent circle,etc.and they claim that each phone creates its own key pair so they would have nothing to give if a adversary came knocking. what I want is a simple PHONE TO PHONE encryption that would work on a standard &#039;&#039;non smart phone&#039;&#039; eg nokia etc

				It&#039;s worth noting that a vulnerability was recently-ish found in GNU&#039;s ZRTPCPP library.&nbsp; That&#039;s the library that handles the encryption for Silent Circle&#039;s app... I don&#039;t think Open Whisper&#039;s RedPhone uses it, but frankly I never really bothered looking at what it uses...<br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;re using old versions of a voice encryption application, you probably want to update if there&#039;s something newer available -- that or make sure your app of choice isn&#039;t using a version of ZRTPCPP that&#039;s vulnerable.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t the encryption that&#039;s the problem, BTW.&nbsp; Apparently it&#039;s possible for unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

				Obviously you would never trust silent circle. The CEO is ex military, they will bend over for the first law enforcement that comes along and feed you a MITM attack session handshake that records your key for easy LE decrypting later. <br /><br />Redphone is free, buy a Nexus 4, go on XDA forums and search for &quot;SECDROID&quot;. Flash it or just flash Cyanogenmod. <br />If you&#039;re using your phone for business, do not use it for browsing unless you only use Orbot + their browser. <br /><br />If you&#039;re worried about Google Play feeding you suspicious apps they won&#039;t without giving you a new TOS to agree to first. This was all covered on hacker news site when that guy was wanted by the NSA and noticed suddenly he was being fed new TOS and buried inside it &#039;you authorize us to hand over your info to law enforcement&#039;. Google is more resistant than we give them credit for.<br /><br />You can always download redphone source and build the .apk yourself in Eclipse, avoiding google. Full instructions on their git <br />

				Zimmerman and the ex military guy &quot;swear up and down&quot; they will never backdoor users, but of course they are talking about legitimate users and not people the FBI or DEA want for trafficking, which is everybody here.

				It&#039;s probably better to use the regular Redphone app though and not your own server and private app to connect to it.<br /><br />The TURN servers are just relaying encrypted RTP packets from one device to another, and the more you get lost in a bunch of other Redphone traffic the better so they can&#039;t prove you talked to somebody. Guilt by association is a real possibility with the clownshoes (in)justice system most of us enjoy though with a private setup, you could double encrypt all traffic end to end inside a vpn and basically have James Bond strength communications. Just hope it&#039;s never seized or remotely analyzed to follow traffic which would reveal the entire crew since it&#039;s a private network and not the regular Redphone servers handling thousands of calls.

				Tor I&#039;m pretty sure is too slow/laggy for voice. I don&#039;t even think Jondonym mixmaster would work with RTP packets fast enough to not just hear echoing static. <br /><br />I guess I can always transparently tunnel all traffic through Tor on my phone right now and call somebody with it as a test. I&#039;m expecting it to not to work though. I wouldn&#039;t root your phone either, if in the future it might be seized. You can bypass encryption, unlock screens and a whole bunch of evil with a rooted phone. Check out secdroid on XDA developers it&#039;s a pretty good replacement for standard carrier installs

You aren&#039;t using a carrier o/s install so no backdoors. All your comms are encrypted end to end so FBI stingray fake cell tower won&#039;t affect you (especially if you have a vpn to tunnel normal browser traffic). <br /><br />When not using this phone and having a meeting with your suppliers about biz stick it in a fridge so it can&#039;t record sound or something else soundproof. If you want to carry it around and not have cell towers always know your every movement get a $15 faraday phone bag off the internet. <br /><br />You&#039;re still vuln to:<br />- plenty of android exploits because you don&#039;t have Pdroid or SEandroid<br />- plenty of linux kernel exploits because android uses outdated kernels<br />- side channels galore because accelerometer is still installed, and other shit like bugmailer and screecap<br />- malware being able to activate camera or bluetooth without you knowing because you didn&#039;t rip it out<br />- future forensic methods because you have fastboot recovery mod and not sabotaged or removed<br />- proprietary exploits like Samsung s4 exploits over the web that can send secret SMS or the Samsung s4 bootloader exploit so they can unlock it without deleting everything and flash forensic mod. <br />

				I see that comsec has posted a lot of info there and while it all makes sense in many ways, I&#039;ve currently got a Samsung Android based phone and maybe I&#039;m super-paranoid or not understanding the info entirely, but I have now and always have had an underlying skepticism about the true safety/privacy that can be achieved on any modern phone by any method, including using any of the growing number of apps that claim anonymity, the various DIY methods of encrypting your phone, also when there are settings right on the phone itself offering encryption of the whole phone and if you want, the SD card too...&nbsp; <br /><br />This is because I don&#039;t see how no matter how strong your password is for instance, since it must be entered at least once directly onto the phone, as well as any apps you download and the login information you type in for many apps, and any other programs you run, etc....&nbsp; It seems as if none of these would work if at least 1 or more of at least 3 different entities are not able to access at the very least your login info and if password protected, one or more of these three it seems to me would have to be able to access that as well:&nbsp; <br /><br />1) The phone manufacturer<br /><br />2) The service provider <br /><br />3) Google (in the case of phones using the Android OS)<br /><br />(not to mention the apps themselves - if using any sort of app for encryption/anonyminity/privacy - just about all of them claim to &quot;need&quot; permissions in order to work that usually include the ability to see, change, delete, add, modify, etc...&nbsp; just about anything at all on your phone)<br /><br />And afaik, all of the above are subject to complying with LE if asked for your info.... if they aren&#039;t already voluntarily supplying it to the various national and international cyberspy agencies....<br /><br />Am I wrong on this?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks.....
