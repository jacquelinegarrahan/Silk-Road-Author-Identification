				So in a scenario where you&#039;re worried about being deanonymized by something exploiting the machine that you&#039;re browsing via Tor with.. and setting aside the obvious &quot;minimize attack surface by { disabling Javascript | running super-kinda-secure-OS | etc }&quot;, and &quot;use physical isolation to hide your real IP from the workstation&quot;:<br /><br />How do you have unidentifiable hardware?&nbsp; Obviously, buying a laptop somewhere not traceable (face to face w/ stranger, paying cash from a location w/o surveillance, etc) is Option A.&nbsp; But has anyone put any effort into scrubbing existing hardware?&nbsp; i.e. you can find Manufacturer Internal utilities to scrub serial numbers,etc from eeproms.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on-board ethernet is a problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;With some vendors (Broadcom, etc) you can find utilities to upload new code to them to reset the stored MAC address, etc, but that&#039;s usually going to require a manufacturer boot image for the card.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wifi cards are often removable or replaceable.<br /><br />Is anybody aware of any decent recipes or research in this area?<br /><br />Pick a Linux box (your booted Tails instance is a good starting point), and, as root, start playing with running &quot;dmidecode&quot; and &quot;lspci -v&quot; and looking at the output.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see what I mean.&nbsp; <br /><br />Virtualizing the OS is an obvious partial solution (Whonix, Qubes OS, etc), but it doesn&#039;t address the core issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;When something pierces your OS, and your hypervisor, you&#039;re right where you started.&nbsp; &nbsp; And with a licensed copy of VMWare, I&#039;m pretty sure the guest OS can see the serial number.<br /><br />Are there other data points that I&#039;m missing from a hardware perspective that are accessible at an (exploited, root) software layer?&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody headed down this path yet?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				First off, I would go virtual box over VMWare. If you do some googling, you should find ways to add extra protection of your Vlan that can&#039;t be added on a traditional Lan port. <br /><br />That said, you could certainly spoof your MAC address. While this isn&#039;t anything spectacular, it&#039;s a deterrent for sure. My experience with LE is that they are easily satisfied. &quot;I see that it&#039;s this, good enough.&quot; - though it&#039;s definitely not a fail-safe. <br /><br />I know they used to have DECAF which was built to contain a bunch of safe guards against the use of COFEE, a computer forensics program. Though I&#039;m not sure what options you have for hardware. There&#039;s a book about hardware solutions for computer security. I understand that it&#039;s relatively thorough, though I have not investigated it.
