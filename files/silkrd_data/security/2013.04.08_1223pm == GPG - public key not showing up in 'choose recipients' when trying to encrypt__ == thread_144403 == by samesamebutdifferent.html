				I am having an issue with GPG, when I highlight the text in text editor ready to encrypt the public key of the person I want to send the message too is not showing in &#039;choose recipients&#039; however when I open GPG keychain access the key is there just fine.<br /><br />Before some smart arse flames for for using a mac I&#039;ve heard it all before so save it&nbsp; ;) but seriously if anyone has any ideas why this is happening I would really appreciate some assistance. <br /><br />I have had this issue before and eventually gave up trying to encrypt for the intended recipient but that&#039;s not an option on this occasion so any help will be much appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers.

				hey same, first off i appreciate the work you do here in the forums. secondly i have a mac and i encounered the same problem. I dont know why it happens but i got it to work by trying these methods in any order one at a time or whatever you want<br /><br />1. try turning off your wirless and resetting your internet closing gpg and re opening it<br />2. open a text edit and see if you can encrypt from there and transfer it to the message<br />3.if you have gpg set up through apple mail trying&nbsp; using that to encrypt and moving it to the message.<br />4. go to system preferences&nbsp; open gpgservices and try changing the key server then go to the gpg key chain access and click update to key server.<br />5. reset the computer and open text edit type your message and try to encrypt<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;i did all these things multiple times and sometimes it just pops back up. Its a pain in the ass and i dont understand it myself but I read a post on the gpg website that someone else had this problem and they suggested them to download the nightly build. i think its a bug.,, but restarting the internet or the computer and immediately trying works sometimes for me. <br />

				SSBD, Here is a tutorial by Guru which helps with a lot of problems for those using a Mac. <br /><br />You would be a lot better off using Gpg4usb, which works on Windows, Mac and Linux OS.<br /><br />Download link&nbsp; - http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html<br /><br />Tutorial by astor - http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />It&#039;s a great piece of software, simple yet robust.<br /><br /><br />This is a tutorial written by former member Guru that should help you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />This is a known issue with the standard build. What you want to do is install the latest nightly build, per the following instructions (originally written by Guru)<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X<br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5)<br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using<br />the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of<br />keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />============================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the<br />recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste<br />it into Text Edit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be<br />found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the<br />Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It<br />will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to highlight the entire document. Then<br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a Text Edit document. Again use<br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the Text Edit document, replacing<br />the encrypted message that was there previously.

				Woah i just did something cool. I dont know if you knew this but i started thinking why some keys where there and some where not when i open gpg keychain acess. so i copied a public key from a vendor and i pasted it in text edit. i saved it under their name. then i opened up gpg key chain access and clicked import and searched for the text edit file. and it imported the key info! and now it seem to be permanently&nbsp; on the list of imported keys! i guess it still doesnt explain why sometimes even if you want to sign with your key nothing comes up. but anyway hope it helps. i think it ha to do with the connection to the server but who knows
