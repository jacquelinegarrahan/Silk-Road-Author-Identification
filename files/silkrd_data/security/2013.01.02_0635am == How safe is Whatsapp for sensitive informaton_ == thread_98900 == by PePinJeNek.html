				I wish everyone a mindblowing 2013!!<br /><br />Just wanted to get some opinions about the usage of whatsapp for sensitive information.<br />I have an android smartphone and use whatsapp to sometimes send text messages <br />that if intercepted by LE could be harmfull for my safety.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a noob but just wanted to find out if anyone can confirm that this service is safe to <br />use and really encrypted all their traffic.<br /><br />I know that previous versions had safety issues and that people could hack your wifi and <br />read all your messages, but apparently this issue is solved plus I never use wifi.<br /><br />For the people who don&#039;t know what it is, it is a messenger service for your mobile that uses mobile data<br />or wifi connection and it claims that their latest version fully encrypted all your messages.<br /><br />&nbsp;Any info or suggestions are welcome.<br /><br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				as safe as a normal text message would be.... not safe at all.<br /><br />If you must use your mobile device for sensitive things, have a look at wickr (might be iphone only) or RedPhone (for encrypted calls) TextSecure (for encrypted messages).<br /><br />If you&#039;re using an android device, make sure you disable the developer mode, and encrypt the device using the inbuilt encryption (Ice-Cream Sandwich or higher version) and use a strong password.<br /><br />

				always use keywords other than actual drug names. try to develop your own rather than use existing slang.<br /><br />the more bulk smalltalk you add, the more shit there is for any spies to sift through. so ask about how people are, what youve been doing etc, casually adding in more sensitive details in shorthand slang.<br />they&#039;ll pass through information without realising it

				Gibberbot - use this !<br /><br />But be advised that somebody else could see that you are using it ! even if the adversary cannot read what ur sending and it isnt logged..<br /><br /><br />In the End Jakob Appelbaum probably would tell you to never ever use a fucking phone.. 8)<br /><br /><br />Cheers!
