				Hey Guys,<br /><br />Have been browsing SR for awhile now and have finally decided to get going. I currently live in Aus and have a limited experience with TOR etc. In terms of obtaining Bit Coins my plan is as follows;<br /><br />1. Purchase a Pre-Paid visa debit card (cash transaction - no trace of ID besides store cameras).<br />2. Use free wire-less internet from a nearby store/unlocked router to purchase bit coins using the debit card.<br />3. Use Bit Coin Fog if people suggest to?<br /><br />After obtaining my Bit Coins would you advise that I download any further programs to ensure anonymity/security? or is it safe to order straight off TOR?<br /><br />Before ordering, I will re-visit an area of free wireless to make the purchase on SR. The postal address will be that of an abandoned house, however the house receives mail regularly (just no-one collects it), I have personally sent a letter to the premises to ensure mail isn&#039;t being diverted. No-one has been living in the house for more than 6 months, it is completely empty.<br /><br />This all seems like a lot of effort, but I prefer clarity of mind, rather than hastily making decisions. <br /><br />Any info/help will be much appreciated,<br /><br />Cheers.

				Piggybacking on a wireless is a good idea as long as they are not smart enough to catch you.&nbsp; I would also run TOR using Linux from an encrypted flash drive.&nbsp; Preferably a flash drive with a Hardware Pin function.&nbsp; If you can purchase Bitcoins using a pre-paid credit card then your pretty much anonymous.&nbsp; However, I would still run my bitcoins through bitcoinfog just prior to entering SR.&nbsp; But keep in mind, I&#039;m rather paranoid. <br /><br />How&#039;s your Pgp knowledge?&nbsp; http://gnupg.org/

				Thanks for the info! Haha don&#039;t worry, i&#039;m just as paranoid as you are if not more. I did have a read of GnuPG website - seems a little complicated for now, will have to get through more of the manual.<br /><br />The only real sensitive information I&#039;m releasing is the postal address. One of the more trusted vendors (Chemical Brothers) supply a link; https://privnote.com whereby you create a message, copy the link, and the message self destructs as soon as it is read. If I&#039;m on TOR, hijacking free wireless and I send the priv note, I think my anonymity will be retained. Will probably use the PGP encryption but the usb flashdrive scenario seems a little overwhelming for me right now.<br />&nbsp;

				Yes, these folks love installing new OSes...&nbsp; but its SO unnecessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />if you are using mac/linux just create a new ENCRYPTED user account.&nbsp; Use a password made up of more than one word (eg passphrase like:&nbsp; mydogrover&nbsp; or onefishtwofish&nbsp; or lemonsmakelemonade)&nbsp; these are really easy to remember and practically impossible to break.&nbsp; &nbsp; then create folders on the desktop with all your silk road passwords and the like.&nbsp; dont&#039; worry the files and folder names all get encrypted.&nbsp; ONLY do SR thru the user account.&nbsp; don&#039;t do ANYTHING personally identifying with the account (login to email/facebook, or google your social security number, etc)<br /><br />If you are using windows 7 you can do it with that too.&nbsp; but i just hate microsoft&#039;s terrible security record, and almost all the LE tools/skill sets is based on cracking windows.&nbsp;

				Is a new OS needed or not?<br /><br />I just figured that a prepaid visa debit card could be used to purchase bit coins because they are used frequently online, or is this not the case?
