				Hi, I use a Macbook with Mac GPG. I am able to import keys into GPG Keychain Access with no problem. However, when I try to encrypt a message, only certain keys are displayed on the list of keys to choose from.<br /><br />I have found that the keys that work have a subkey. When listed in GPG Keychain Access the keys that work have a &quot;pub&quot;, &quot;uid&quot; and &quot;sub&quot; entry, while the ones that don&#039;t work only have &quot;pub&quot; and &quot;uid&quot;. If I check the details on a certificate, the ones that work have an entry on the &quot;Subkeys&quot; tab.<br /><br />Does anyone else have this problem? Is there a work-around on my end? <br /><br />Thanks<br />

				Yes, thanks for the info. After doing a better search I found this thread - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26216.0 with the info about installing the nightly build.<br /><br />I would suggest to vendors that you update your keys to ones with subkeys as you may be losing customers without even knowing it cause they can&#039;t encrypt their message to you so they just pick someone else.<br />

				I&#039;m sure this has been posted in a more comprehensive thread. However, here are the steps for encrypting on the command line (which works without using the nightly build).<br /><br />1. Create a text file with the info to encrypt (in Text Edit) and save it (in this example, to &quot;addr.txt&quot;)<br />2. Open Terminal,<br />3. Find the user you want to encrypt to (their email address) by running &quot;gpg --list-keys&quot;<br />3. Encrypt with &quot;gpg --recipient user@domain.com --armor --encrypt addr.txt&quot;<br />4. Show the encrypted file with &quot;cat addr.txt.asc&quot;<br /><br />

Adding an encryption sub-key can be done in 30 seconds -- the instructions on how to do this were even posted by Guru some time ago. Now that DPR has stated that using&nbsp; PGP is optional, there will be even less incentive to use it than before. As I&#039;m beginning to learn, the sad fact of the matter is that people are far more interested in convenience than safety. <br />
