				There was ___ (forget his name) that was selling tons of drugs for years on OVDB, and he was caught by the police a while back.<br /><br />Does anyone know how he got caught?<br /><br />I know there are controlled deliveries, but lets say the cops don&#039;t want to do a controlled delivery and instead would rather watch the address looking for people selling via the postal system?<br /><br />I mean, he wasn&#039;t caught via a controlled delivery, right? So what happened? Do the cops ever wait for multiple deliveries to the same address?<br /><br /><br />I know I&#039;m rambling, but I think it is important subject to discuss.

				Don&#039;t forget a lot of sellers on OVDB/SR are also sellers in IRL (where there&#039;s a much greater risk of getting caught) so it could be something unrelated to his online dealings.<br /><br />just my 2 cents.

				From my understanding thats how the BIG LSD and MDMA vendor over on OVDB got caught. Something completely unrelated to online stuff. Then they started watching him for months and built a big case on him =(

I never ordered from this vendor because I felt (rightlly so) that he was a bit too above board and I felt the OVDB was sort of reckless from the start (it was actually an experiment by the admin anyway). <br /><br />It turns out this vendor was doing a six figure business IRL with his significant other (exposing another person to risk as well as exposing himself to betrayal) . The presence of his business online was NOT what alerted him to law enforcement, rather, it was sloppy security measures IRL. IMHO typical LE does not have the tech to really track what is going on behind TOR, nor to they have the focus/smarts like we are paranoid about. We are not dealing with the NSA here. <br /><br />However, they are not stupid and they have a fairly obvious customs system. This vendor ordered bulk RCs from overseas from a suspicious country and it was flagged with a love letter. As we are aware the USPS is lacking in funds and instead of kicking in your door they just seize your goods and flag your address. When this happened, the vendor DID NOT change his delivery box and continued to have bulk sent to his box which eventually resulted in a controlled delivery from his po box to his HOUSE. Amazingly, after the first love letter this guy continued to over bulk from overseas!<br /><br />LESSON #1: Having a box doesn&#039;t protect you esp in terms of stupidity. Even with a fake ID, PO Box does not guarantee of temporary anonymity, only a buffer.<br /><br />Eventually after a search warrant executed on his house they found ALL OF HIS ONLINE BUSINESS after raiding, including labels and product etc.to customers and his significant other was now involved.<br /><br />LESSON #2: Keep your house/vending &amp; packing area/shipping &amp; receiving separate. Keep online business separate from IRL business, or preferably don&#039;t do business IRL at all. Don&#039;t involve other people who don&#039;t follow security measures.<br /><br />With your real life separate from your virtual life there is no risk of these two worlds colliding and if one area is compromised, it will be a dead end and you can recover.<br /><br />BTW another even dumber vendor who was busted was also a flashy IRL vendor who also was arrested IRL, prob by a snitch or someone wanting to take down his business. <br /><br />So I personally will not do business with someone who I sense is vending IRL because it exposes me as a buyer to risk. <br /><br />Just something to think about whether you buy or sell. <br />&nbsp;

				That is understandable. I&#039;m way to paranoid to get anything shipped to my home address, let alone sell anything face to face.<br /><br />I&#039;m just jealous he had such awesome wholesale connections.

				Selling drugs in real life is super risky........so many snitches and they are snitchen for so many different reasons that its hard to figure out who is snitchen. It sounds to me like this sellers down fall was greed. I mean honestly how much money do you need to make to be happy? Plus you cannot be flashy you gotta keep your shit on the down low and stash the money in case something happens. I dont sell drugs but to me it only makes sense that online sales when dont properly are safer and can be just as profitable. I advise everyone to avoid selling in real life.........to many snitches and if you know about SR its like wtf are you doing selling in real life for anyways...........Greed is the down fall of many people.
