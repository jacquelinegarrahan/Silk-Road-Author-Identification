				Update from sr support:<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re working on a small issue with archived addresses at the moment; to avoid this in future, please always use a new address for each deposit.<br /><br />Apologies for the delay - it&#039;ll be fixed as soon as possible!<br /><br />~Vendor Support&quot;<br /><br />never had this issue using an old address before, but i will certainly use a new one every time now.

				as per DPR&#039;s recent post:<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ve corrected the problem with delayed deposits, but it is likely that&nbsp; a few were never credited.&nbsp; If you are still waiting on a deposit,&nbsp; please contact support with the deposit address and amount so they can&nbsp; manually review your case and credit you.&nbsp; Sorry to those that were&nbsp; affected by this.&quot;
