				Apparently I came in at the wrong time, with exchb closing. But as a first timer, you can imagine I&#039;m nervous with my first exchange on silk road. I&#039;d like a bit of advice or critique on my plan I&#039;ve drafted up.<br />1. Purchase Moneypak at walmart with cash.<br />2. Put moneypak through get-bitcoin (They currently have it disabled, but it says they should be accepting moneypak again within a week)<br />3. get-bitcoin sends BTC to my personal wallet (Is it safe to use the client on my computer, or should i just stick to eWallets?) And tumble through 2-3 wallets online.<br />4. Send off the BTC to my SR account, and away we go!<br />I know this probably isn&#039;t worth making a topic over, but I hope you guys understand. First time seems a bit frightening, but it&#039;s also pretty exciting.<br />I&#039;ve got a real life friend with a fairly large amount of BTC, if I can talk him into selling me some I assume that&#039;d be much safer than buying them online.<br />Thanks for your help, everyone.<br />Edit: So far I&#039;ve only been using silk road messaging to talk to people. Am I going to need to set up PGP or GPG or whatever it is to send my address, or does it just go encrypted through silk road? I&#039;m assuming I&#039;ll need one of those encryption methods, and if so could someone point me to a guide to getting those setup? And also, thanks a lot for all of the quick and helpful responses!

				Although I have never used MoneyPak and know nothing about the system, this sounds like a pretty safe bet that you&#039;ll be completely anonymous.&nbsp; If not over kill.&nbsp; All I do is transfer the money from my bank account to the online bitcoins exchange then transfer it to my wallet then a online tor bitcoins wallet and into my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I ever get caught it&#039;s not going to be because they tracked down my bitcoin address.&nbsp; It&#039;s going to be because they found drugs.<br /><br />Sun

				Was wondering if it was safe to buy a mtgox gift card for like 30 BTC, then straight up transfer them to the wallet in the BITCOIN app.<br /><br />Is that safe? <br /><br />Any other percautions for not getting cought with the BTC wallet?

				Honestly you&#039;re going through a lot of extra work for no real gain, do it if it makes you feel safe but otherwise it doesn&#039;t really do anything. So you&#039;ve hidden the fact you sent bitcoins to SR? This in itself is not illegal and I doubt a cop even if they managed to find your exact transactions could use this to get a warrant or the like. <br /><br />The actual danger comes in the thing you get sent to you, if it gets stopped on way and they set you up so that once you&#039;ve got it and opened it they bust in. That said the chance of them doing that is low anyway as they want dealers not users, that and if you pick the right sellers you won&#039;t have this problem anyway.
