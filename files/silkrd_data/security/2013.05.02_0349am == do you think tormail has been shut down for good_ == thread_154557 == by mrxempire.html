				I am desperately trying to gain access to my tormail account, because I have my login information for bitstamp stored there. I remember my bitstamp password, but&nbsp; have forgotten my user I.D number. From what I have been reading, tormail has been down for some time now. What worries me is that there is no information about what is happening being released by the tormail admins. If tormail becomes shut down for good, then it looks like I will never be able to access the bitcoins I have stored on bitstamp(1500 U.S dollars worth), since I made an account using my tormail address, and the I.D/password recovery info would be sent there. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? I&#039;m starting to get a little nervous here.

				I would contact Bitstamp.&nbsp; They are able to get this for you if you have the original email that you used to set-up the account.<br /><br />Having said that, I got in to Tormail 2 days ago and it has been down again since.&nbsp; I will NEVER trust them again after this.

				Tormail as done such things in the past.<br /><br />Turn off the whole clearnet URL.<br /><br />But I&#039;m sure they will be back.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, who is ready to launch (with knowledge :) ) a new tor email service.<br /><br />Should not be hard to do.<br /><br /><br />That would be great :)
