				I have the same question.&nbsp; Most methods promoted on SR are US only options. <br />I&#039;m getting a &#039;don&#039;t trust this website&#039; message trying to get to BitNZ<br />And the &#039;successful orders to NZ&#039; thread is getting me: &quot;The topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you.&quot;<br /><br />help!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

I have had several customers from New Zealand now and it has worked like a charm for them too. If you&#039;re interested feel free to visit my listing below and follow the steps there:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/57b32a1924<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				In light of Vlad&#039;s &#039;departure&#039; from the Road....<br /><br />We have just listed a NZD/AUD for BTC service, via cash in the mail to Australia.<br /><br />We charge a flat fee of AUD$25, regardless of transaction size.<br /><br />Customers will have to pay AUD to BTC fees, but the day we receive the cash, is the day you will receive your Bitcoins.<br /><br />Happy to answer any questions you guys have.<br /><br />Listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/5f8554516c<br /><br />**Since we are a new vendor, we will offer the first FIVE buyers a $5 discount on the product. Just mention this in checkout**<br /><br />We are also thinking of a BTC to NZD listing, if there is any demand. This listing will include one of our anonymous VISA cards, loaded with your Bitcoins.<br /><br />El Lobo Negro
