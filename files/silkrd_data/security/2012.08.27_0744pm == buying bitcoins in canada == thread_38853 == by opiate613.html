				https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/VirtEx<br /><br />That is info about a bitcoin exchange that accepts CAD. Yes, you can send your coins directly to SR.<br /><br /><br />If you have a SR account and you don&#039;t know your pin number, you need to get it reset. There&#039;s a 7 day waiting period after you request the reset until it actually gets reset. If you haven&#039;t created a SR account yet, don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll create a Pin when you make your account. Don&#039;t lose it. You use the Pin when you make purchases. Just like a Pin on a debit card. You need the card and the Pin to make a purchase. If someone steals your card, they can&#039;t use it because they don&#039;t have the Pin. You need your SR password and your Pin to make a purchase. If someone steals your password, they won&#039;t be able to buy anything because they need the Pin. It&#039;s a security feature.

				Hi Opiate, someone asked this question last week, here&#039;s what I posted for them:<br /><br />Yesterday I had the same question you have, today I have bitcoins. Here&#039;s what I did:<br /><br />Part 1 - Create Wallet<br />1) I opened up Firefox and went to https://blockchain.info/<br />2) Along the top menu I clicked on &#039;wallet&#039;<br />3) I clicked on &#039;create my free wallet&#039;<br />4) I entered a 10 digit password twice (remember this!) -&nbsp; and hit enter<br />5) My wallet was created, It&#039;s some crazy long dashed hexadecimal number - copy and paste this into a text file somewhere so you can reference it later when you need to re-login if auto-fill doesn&#039;t do it&#039;s job.<br />6) I went back to https://blockchain.info/ , clicked on &#039;wallet&#039; and then &quot;login now&quot;<br />7) The crazy hexadecimal number appeared as my identifier and I used my super secret 10 digit password THAT I DIDN&#039;T FORGET from step 4<br />8) I was now logged into my wallet and saw 0.00 BTC $ 0.00 which means no funds BUT at least I was ready to stock it up<br />9) I copied my crazy hexadecimal identifier number like I was going to paste it somewhere else ...<br /><br />Part 2 - Buy Bitcoins, Fund Wallet<br />1) I opened another browser tab and went to https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/<br />2) Where it says &quot;I will be paying with:I selected &quot;TD Bank Payee / Cash at Branch&quot;<br />3) Where it says &quot;I want buy &lt;drop down box&gt; worth of bitcoins&quot; I selected $100<br />4) I entered a valid email address<br />5) Where it says &quot;My wallet address to deposit the bicoins in is&quot; - I pasted my crazy hexadecimal identifier number from Part 1 and selected &#039;validate&#039;<br />6) My wallet number was validated, I know this cause the box went all green and I got a message saying so.<br />7) I went to my valid email account and saw a new email from &quot;Canadian Bitcoins&quot;<br />8) The email told me to go to a TD bank branch (any branch will do) and deposit a specific dollar and cent amount into a given account number<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (very important to be precise to the penny cause that&#039;s how they know it&#039;s you making the cash deposit) into a bank account # - you can ignore the stuff about adding a personal payee<br />9) I wrote down the account number (as well as the specific branch and account holder info) and took it with me to my local TD bank along with the exact dollar and cent amount to be deposited<br />10) I talked to a teller and deposited the cash. It was like she did this everyday - no ID needed, completely anonymous.<br />11) I went home, brought up my blockchain wallet by re-logging into https://blockchain.info/ and saw ... nothing, no deposit amount<br />12) I kind of freaked cause I&#039;d never done this before and thought I&#039;d just lost $100. Oh well.<br />13) went to bed, woke up, logged into https://blockchain.info/ and saw ... my bitcoin deposit amount<br /><br />That is all. Hope it helps

I&#039;m not saying he needs a DoD spec password, but a 10 character mix of letters and numbers is significantly stronger.<br /><br /><br />Good writeup otherwise. If I see any more Canadian users, I&#039;ll point them to this.
