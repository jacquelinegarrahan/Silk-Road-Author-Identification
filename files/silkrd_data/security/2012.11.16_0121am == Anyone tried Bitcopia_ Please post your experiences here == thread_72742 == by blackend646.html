				Well we all know Bitinstant is no longer convenient and asks way too many questions, and drugs are expensive enough without paying 10% fees on bitcoin. <br /><br />So has anyone here taken the plunge and tried Bitcopia yet? How long did the entire process take? Was it as simple as making a deposit at BoA or Chase used to be? <br /><br />There isn&#039;t a whole lot of literature on this service yet, so any information would be extremely valuable. I&#039;ll likely try it out myself and update this post in a week or two provided I don&#039;t hear anything off-putting.

				yeah i tried em out last friday ; the whole process took about 3 hrs from deposit; yeah the same bank thing except the only info bitcopia tells you is account name no # or anything but they can just look acct name up so no id no bullshit like bitinstant yeah bitcopia may charge a little more per coin so that is the fee i got 26.00 coins for $294 and some change 11.34/coin

				I had a smooth transaction with bitcopia, bought 12 coins for 137.64, 11.47 per coin.&nbsp; I made the deposit within the two hour window and I had bitcoins 12 hours later.&nbsp; It would have been sooner, but I was a new customer so they couldn&#039;t send bitcoins until the deposit cleared their account.&nbsp; Give them a try, Id oubt they&#039;ll disappoint

				I&#039;m having a dreadful first experience. First if you deposit before 2pm EST they make you wait a day. The next day the Bitcopia guy takes off so no bitcoins. The next day is Sunday so also no bitcoins. So looks like 72 hours after the deposit I HOPE to have bitcoins. Stick with bitinstant and CVS if you need bitcoins quickly.

				i put in a fairly big order through bank deposit. talked to the customer service rep or whatever, he seems really nice and gave me all information that i could want or need. because its my first order i have to wait for it to go through or whatever. they told me tomorrow morning i should have all my btc. seems legit, kinda like the old getbitcoin site. we&#039;ll see in about 12 hours or so.

				just to update everyone. went to bed without the coins and woke up to them! :)<br /><br />looks like i wound up paying around $20-$25 for a $600 deposit. seems like there are a few more options now that bitinstant has become a bit of a hassle. i suggest bitcopia without reservations. there are others too but i wont mention them on this thread.

				I ended up going with Bitme.com instead, for no real fault of Bitcopia other than that they were not accepting orders for a few days. Was a great experience overall, not entirely sure if it was a fluke but the process was just as quick as Bitinstant.<br /><br />You can read my full endorsement here<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=87660.msg628235#msg628235

				Few Questions about Bitcopia from You guys:<br /><br />1. Only deposits can be made at Wells fargo?<br /><br />2. Was any ID needed at the bank?<br /><br />3. For new customers they want to wait for the funds to clear I understand, but wouldn&#039;t every transaction appear as a new transaction since all the info we would use is fake?

Also I think returning customers are identified by their bitcoin address but you can e-mail and ask but obviously they have a way to tell.

				Hey guys, since bitcopia came back online today I figured I&#039;d try a small order out with it ($40). Just deposited it 20 or so minutes ago and everything went smoothly. The lady at the desk was a little confused and thought I was depositing into my own account so asked me my name (gave her a fake one obv.) and called her manager over. Manager asked if account was mine, told her that it wasn&#039;t and I was just paying a bill and she sent it through. If everything goes good with this one I&#039;ll be doing a larger one in a few weeks. I&#039;ll let you guys know how long it takes for the coins to arrive in my strongcoin address.

Also they allow cash deposits in a bank , bitinstant does not at this time. I just don&#039;t feel comfortable walking into CVS or wallmart with hundreds of dollars in cash. In a bank this is a more normal thing to do. <br /><br />bitinstant is a bigger operation , you don&#039;t have to worry about them taking the week off , they give you your coins faster and you can give them a fake name if you want. Ive used them in the past and they work fine.

				I have used them 2 times now. VERY nice quick and easy. AND QUICK i mean QUICK. by the time i have walked back from the bank the funds are there. <br /><br />The site is easy to use and well it works and its fast and the fee i dont even look at really. Its better then online vendors and its very very easy. SO i will pay the higher fees if they are.. Cause its good to support those making it easy. U have one hour to complete the deposit from creation so set that time to get to the bank location of your choice. <br /><br />I will use them X-CLUSIVLY!. I found them when bitinstant was down and the guy on the forums seemed like good people. <br /><br />

				He told me there is a flag on the account for the teller to reject any check deposit. I guess this is so when a deposit is made he doesn&#039;t have to worry about it being a bad check. Being the paranoid btc user that i am, i was kinda freaked out the first time too. But just email him. I email him all the time. Super nice dude, always willing to help out. Bitcopia is AWESOME.
