Bank deposits and cash in mail are best options. Some people charge 0% for cash in mail. <br />Most of the good bud plugs on SR are stealth / invisible, but you can find decent prices from the standard vendors.<br />For xanax, you might want to look into powder, it&#039;s very cheap, and if you press them, I think you can make good $.<br /><br /><br />
