				They only got the owner of Freedom Hosting, not the creators of the pedo websites.<br />Meanwhile they also silently got Tormail, which is never mentioned, so it is now in the hands of the NSA. That&#039;s only a total coincidence of course, the NSA has totally nothing to do with it.<br /><br />The malware didn&#039;t infect anyone with anything. The only residue is a cookie in the browser.

Pedophilia does not mean that you molest children. It can mean that, but it generally means you get off on watching kiddie porn (God I&#039;m embarrassed to explain this and feel the need to also include an obligatory &#039;I&#039;m not a pedophile&#039; disclaimer too), which wasn&#039;t illegal in the US until the 1980s (not illegal to possess I should say).<br /><br />Anywho, all they did was take down Freedom Hosting&#039;s servers. When they say it affected TBB users, they meant that other non-porn sites (like fucking tormail for example) were taken down because they were hosted by those servers. As far as I know, none of that was done using malware targeted at individual TBB users, but I wouldn&#039;t take my word for it.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t download PDFs or Word files or anything like that from unknown sources. And give Linux a go. It&#039;s not 100% secure, but most malware is written for Windows. There is a tiny bit for Mac and even less for Linux.<br /><br />Oh, and regarding Java, you should have Java disabled in all of your browsers unless you specifically need to run a Java applet (which almost no one needs to do now). If you need to use it, keep a separate browser for Java related tasks<br /><br />PS I&#039;m NOT talking about java script if that&#039;s what you meant.<br /><br /><br />

This shit was news two months ago. And I am glad he included the mandatory disclaimer or else everybody would think he is a pedophile. Sometimes I even spontaneously say &quot;I am not a pedophile&quot; just to let people know. If you don&#039;t say it every so often people start to wonder.

				Regardless of the fucktard who started the thread, there&#039;s a valid unanswered question here I think.<br /><br />How did they find FH?

To the best of my understanding what happened was that the FBI planted a malicious application on certain servers (hosted by Freedom Hosting), at least some of which were believed to contain child pornography. The net effect of this application was to &#039;phone home&#039; as it were, outside of Tor, and report on certain properties of the user&#039;s computer, including the computer name and IP address.&nbsp; In order for this to happen 4 things needed to occur: <br /><br />1) The ostensible victim had to be running a Windows computer. Given that the payload was designed to affect Windows machines, people running other OSes were unaffected. <br /><br />2) The victim had to be running a vulnerable version of the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) or otherwise be running a vulnerable version ot both Tor and Firefox. <br /><br />3) The victim had to fail to disable Java/Javascript. <br /><br />4) The victim had to be trying to access one of the systems booby-trapped by the FBI during the period when the exploits were running. <br /><br />What you appear to be thinking of is a &#039;traditional&#039; malware infection, where a site leaves something nasty on your system. This is not the case here. There is nothing to clean up, as the malicious app would only have run on a vulnerable system during the time when you tried to access a booby-trapped system. <br /><br />Finally, as much as you may despise the pedos, I wouldn&#039;t be rooting for the FBI, if I were you. Remember, the same methods that can be used against THEM can also be used against US. <br />It is a trusim that: either EVERYONE is safe or NO ONE is safe. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br />
