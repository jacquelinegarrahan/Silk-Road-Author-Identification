				Have been trying to get on bitinstant but am getting the Untrusted / Security Certificate prompts and am a little skeptical on this script.. Have never had this happen before and am worried about doing anything until I find out if anyone else is running into this. Showing, any transactions if the certificates don&#039;t match and the connection is unsecure......<br /><br />Feedback anyone??

I hope...<br /><br />and yes, this is my only way of getting btc as well which is obviously weighing heavy on me right now especially with needing to get some things going that I&#039;ve put on the back burner for the past week now (which I should have just done before but hey, the past is the past). So I&#039;m wondering if anyone else has had this occur and if they proceeded anyways and what their outcome was, etc. All that good stuff.<br /><br />Appreciate your response guys! The forum fam has some truly great people around and of course the no-good as well but overall, anytime I&#039;ve ever had to reach out for help or feedback, I am guaranteed to get some great advice so thank you! Hoping someone has some good answers here today for me...

				Long time lurker, very seldom poster. Use different handle on buying side, but used BitInstant approx 24 hours ago with no problem. Already spent. I just checked and not getting any cert. warning.

				Well well, wouldn&#039;t you know ;)&nbsp; Tried it again a second ago and everything seems to be back to norm and good to go! Woot! I don&#039;t know what it is, but whenever I run into any problems with anything and pop on to the forums, I must get good luck from you guys somehow haha so whatever you guys always do, THANK YOU! :)&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, how does everyone stay anonymous on bitinstant since you cant use Tor anymore? Or are you just using your &quot;normal&quot; browser? I searched but really haven&#039;t found too much on this. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to keep an eye on things just in case anyone in the near future runs into any problems like this. Hopefully we are good to go from this point forward! But again, thank you so much for the replies and help, really appreciate it everyone!<br />&nbsp;
