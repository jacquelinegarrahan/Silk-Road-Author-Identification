				Please everyone beware that Bear Paw is a scammer! Just stole $155 from me claiming to sell bitcoins. Also this user has multiple accounts one including the name &quot;those coins&quot; that he uses to boost his reputation. If you would like proof please pm me and I will send you snap shots of our discussion. CLAIMS TO BE A DEA AGENT!

				Hey all so I am purchasing myself a vendor account (hopefully today) to sell my hacked paypal accounts with $1k-$2k pre-loaded on them. As a new vendor I will be selling samples extremely cheap until I prove myself then I will slowly start raising the price. You will be making more then $700 profit on each one. Not trying to sell them here but just wondering how many people would be interested in this sort of thing on SR. I have already been selling them for a little while offline until my discovery of SR and realizing this is the perfect place to offer this. <br /><br />redsta1ns first post.<br /><br />whos a scammer? you are you nigger thief.....what did i steal your stolen cash? boohoo cry nigger CRY!!!!!!!!<br /><br />and those coins is a real person i sold coins too 3 people. your just a nigger thief. your money will<br />get made in to bitcoins and given to mods and dpr.<br />how does it feel NIGGER i dont care if i get banned for this.

				I notice he goes after newbies. I guess its a lesson learned. But I find it laughable that he is still messaging me trying to convince me he is a DEA agent and that somehow he can track a MP card that was purchased with cash.

Claiming to be DEA!<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure who the bigger cunt is?&nbsp; :o

That is just a cover up of his own ass. I was not the only person he tried to scam and he goes for newbies. If he were a true robin hood he would go for the people that have done something wrong. He did not even know that i sold accounts until after he stole my money. This is a forum to sell illegal drugs, weapons, tools for criminals, my service is not any worse then anyone elses (possibly minus the weed dealers as that should be legal anyways)
