				I was starting this thread with the subject &quot;We&#039;re soon to hit $180&quot; but by the time TORs fat ass took its sweet time we just hit $180. It&#039;s not even 4am in New York yet. NYT print article on btc will hit Wall Street today. Boom. When investors start pressuring big money fund managers to get into this, and they&#039;re forced to for fear of losing their jobs.. then.. the party REALLY starts. 8)

				But the prices of drugs here are pegged to the dollar though. So your $100 dollars worth of drugs will still cost you $100 dollars worth of drugs (but you will have less BTC). You see what I mean?

				i bought 10g of molly for 8btc about 3 or 4 weeks ago.&nbsp; now that i&#039;ve collected the cash from selling it, i&#039;ve broken even to what 8 btc are worth now. BTC is turning into a commodity rather than a currency.&nbsp; i was going to buy an ounce, but at this point i think i might make more money by just holding on to my coin.<br /><br />we need to get Litecoin accepted here on SR as soon as freaking possible.&nbsp; don&#039;t get me wrong, I am very happy about the growth of BTC, but for our little SR economy here we really need a slightly more stable (at least for now) currency.

I stopped looking at my SR buyer stats ages ago to avoid getting depressed. Thousands of dollars vanished with nothing to show for it except some awesome highs. Look on the bright side, we never have problems buying from vendors as they&#039;ll take one look at our stats and give the VIP treatment, throw in freebies, faster shipping times, better communications then someone with<br />7 months on the road/2 purchases/$37 dollars spent/50% Auto Finalize rate/50% refund rate. LOL. <br />But yeah, a friend of mine used to big on hitting the casinos. He made a fuckton, he lost a fuckton etc. I went to Vegas with him once and obviously they were giving him the high roller treatment with a massive suite and all kinds of comped goodies. His casino host was in the room partying with us and I casually asked the host in a semi serious way, &quot;Out of curiosity, what are my buddies stats?&quot; and he goes &quot;I can pull them right now, you really wanna know?&quot; (looking towards my buddy), he immediately was like &quot;NO! DO NOT tell me, it will fuck my mood up for the entire weekend&quot;. <br />

				Its been said else where that MtGox is under a dDos attack and people are panicking and selling so is that why the trading engine is lagging?<br /><br />Mtgox trading engine lag: 4588.90s<br /><br />Time to buy I think

				Ugh. Of course I ran out and bought $400 worth of coins at lunch time today when they were ~$230/coin and now theyve dropped back to 180. I see many people attributing the drop to MtGox getting DDOS&#039;d.<br />I pretty much know jack shit about money markets and investing and all the economic and political things that effect exchange rates... could someone explain to me why mtgox being slow translates to the value of the btc lowering? I should start learning these things I suppose. I realize they are the biggest mover of btc, but I still dont understand the connection between their issues and the value of the coin. Enlighten me please, educated ones,
