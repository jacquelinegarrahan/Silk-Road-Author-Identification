				•••• READ &quot;I would like to apologize for this vague thread but my head is such a mess, full of questions, constantly looking for things to improve making it difficult to fully express myself&quot;••••<br /><br />My dear anonymous friends,<br /><br />I&#039;m a starting vendor which has been a longtime OVDB member and has been a member of SR since 2011. I have made an fresh account for an obvious reason &quot;security&quot;&nbsp; and i would like ask to ask the community kindly to help me with the same reason.<br /><br />I want to maximize the security from any angle possible as my conscience doesn&#039;t allow me to vend before the safety of the customer is safe and of course my own security.<br /><br />I did not want to work on a system that possibly could have flaws so i purchased a brand new notebook, i also was in possession of a bootable usb with ubuntu installed on it.<br /><br />So here i am with a clean laptop, label printer, usb, software*, among with other items<br />* Tor, truecrypt, vmware workstation etc (suggestions greatly appreciated)<br /><br /><br />My first idea was to install Truecrypt on my notebook with a hidden volume (3 passwords, 2 dummy passwords and one for the secret volume) <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">however even after i did some research i wasn&#039;t able to find answers to my questions and i didn&#039;t want to (excuse me) fuck shit up and mess up my notebook so i&#039;ve let this idea rest until i&#039;d found someone that could guide me through the process.<br /></code><br />On the hidden volume i would install VMware Workstation and run Tor from there (could purchase a offshore VPN with no logs as an extra security layer).<br /><br />Second idea:<br />Then i tried to crypt my usb so i at least had one way that i could condone business (i tried to crypt from my notebook and on my usb itself) both didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />So basically i wasted some time as i can&#039;t install the label printer on the USB thus making it useless, so i&#039;d still have to crypt my whole laptop.<br /><br />All suggestions, tips are welcome!<br /><br /><br />Q:<br />// When encrypting your whole Hard disk (Hidden)<br />1: Will you lose all your data? Can you screw up in such a way that your main OS corrupts?<br />2: Will you need to have the &#039;dummy&#039; OS burned on a CD / have the file on a USB or can you simply have it on your computer?<br /><br />I&#039;d also would like to know what the dangers are of Truecrypt, what common mistakes are that might cause vulnerability&#039;s and other info that might come in handy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to bother you guys with these questions but i tried, and i saw SR as the best place to find skilled people, and if you want a small fee for your help that&#039;s fine too :)<br /><br />Thanks guys! And let&#039;s make this a informative thread for the whole board.<br /><br />- Safety First.

				OK so first technically it is possible to mess up the encryption, but the worst that can happen is you have to reinstall everything, you won&#039;t permanently damage any hardware.<br /><br />You should just encrypt the entire laptop hard drive and put the &quot;naughty&quot; operating system as a hidden operating system. (Assuming you want to use Windows):<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-operating-system<br /><br />You then get two passwords, one you tell the police which takes them to a clean dummy Windows, and another you keep for yourself and never divulge. They can&#039;t prove the naughty operating system exists due to plausible denyability because it just looks like empty or unused space on the hard drive so you&#039;re safe.<br /><br />Even better is to use a specialist Linux operating system such as Tails which can run off a memory stick and leaves no traces on your laptop. There&#039;s thousands of guides how to get it up and running. It&#039;s a better option for you because all the dodgy stuff is on a memory stick which is encrypted and you don&#039;t have to worry about doing anything. It also deals with all your Tor etc for you.<br /><br />Your printer will work fine with Tails on memory stick, it&#039;s just a case of finding the correct Linux drivers, just like you would have to find and install drivers for Windows. Also a VPN is good idea, but use it with Tails.&nbsp; :)

				I recommend total fingerprint awareness when packaging your packages. Wear gloves, and don&#039;t use tape or touch anything which could retain a partial or full fingerprint without them.
