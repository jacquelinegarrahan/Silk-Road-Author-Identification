				Ok, so I&#039;ve been using Liberte Linux for well over a year. I love it for the most part. It did everything I needed it to do with ease.<br /><br />Recently I lost power to my computer and it wiped out alot of my persistant volume, presumably corrupting it. Although it&#039;s heartbreaking that I&#039;ll never retireve the hours of work and valuable information contained therein, I&#039;ve moved on. I&#039;ve moved on and started from ground zero.<br /><br />Here is the part that is DRIVING ME BONKERS. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get a persistant volume to work again! Time after time I&#039;ve tried to reinstall liberte only to get stuck with the &quot;read only&quot; version. Sure, it get&#039;s the job done, but I MISS my persisant volume dearly!<br /><br />So recently I gave tails a shot. HOLY SHIT I LOVE TAILS. Actally, they both have their pros and cons I&#039;m finding. But even with Tails, I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to make a persistant volume!<br /><br />Please forgive my ignorance of linux. By no means am I fluent and most instructions are completely lost on me.<br /><br />LONG ago, a very generous member wrote a step by step guide on how to properly install Liberte on USB (this inclded a persistant volume). I followed this individuals instructions during serveral subsequent upgrades without fail. FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I cannot find these instructions. <br /><br />When I extract liberte<br /><br />If anyone out there is knowledgeable and capable of explaining how to creat a persistant volume on EITHER liberte or Tails (preferably), you have my gratitude friend.<br /><br />I have a hunch that it&#039;s just a lack of technical knowledge when it comes to linux that is getting in the way. <br /><br />To be clean, I&#039;m trying to run either program as a LiveUSB distro WITH persistant volume.<br /><br />Anyone kind enough to share this knowledge with me, please explain it as if I&#039;m 5. Or 10. I&#039;m not a complete idiot when it comes to this but alot of linux jargon is difficult for me to grasp without background.<br /><br />I&#039;m really really digging tails btw. SOOOO much faster. I&#039;m missing the gpa that Liberte has, but I managed to get whatever version Tails has to work, but it took a minute for me to become accustomed to it. <br /><br />THANK YOU kindly in advance :)<br /><br /><br /><br />For some context with my Liberte problem, here is what happens:<br />2. Install Liberte to USB<br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as<br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.<br /><br /><br />3. Boot from USB<br /><br />Now shut down your computer. To be able to boot from a USB flashdrive, you will have to change some settings in the BIOS. To access the BIOS, power-on<br />your computer and press whichever key is specified on your screen (usually something like &quot;Press F12 to access Boot menu...&quot;). Using the arrow keys,<br />scroll over to the &quot;Boot&quot; tab. Scroll down to the option &quot;USB HDD: YOUR USB&#039;s NAME HERE&quot; and move it to the top of the list. Save changes and exit.<br /><br /><br />4. Using Liberte<br /><br />The first time you boot Liberte will be really slow because it has to create an encrypted key for you. The loading bar will stop at about 3/4ths of the way,<br /><br />****HERE IS THE PROBLEM FOR ME******* It says something about 18xx MB 1/4 yada yadda (forgive me I don&#039;t recall excatly what it says)...but it just FREEZES UP, forever! I don&#039;t recall ever having this issue in the past. <br />If someone could shed some lite on the problem that would be a huge help.<br /><br /><br />Ideally, however, I&#039;d like to make a full swith to the new Tails and leave Liberte in the dust...IF ONLY I could figure out how to creat a persistant volume.<br /><br />Again, thanks in advance awesome people who are smarter than I.

				If you have not sorted this out by now, and I expect you have seeing as it is so long ago, the first and probably only thing you are doing wrong is in using the BIOS to reorder the Boot sequence.<br />There is no need to do that, there should be another key that allows you to setup the the device to boot from. Can&#039;t remember what it is called, but it is something like &quot;Boot Menu&quot;, select using number or cursor key and you have about 5 to 10 seconds to do it. Select the &quot;Boot from USB&quot; option and then it should proceed normally.<br />Liberte creates its own LUKS persistent volume once you have entered a strong password, 12 characters or similar.<br />Hope this helps.
