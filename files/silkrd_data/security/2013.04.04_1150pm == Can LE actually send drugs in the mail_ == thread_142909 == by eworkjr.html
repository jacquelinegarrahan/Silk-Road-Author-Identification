				Im currently talking to an associate over tormail about sending me something and it got me thinking.. Can LE pose as a vendor and actually send you a package you order from them and subsequently bust you? Or would they just watch that address closely from the point they get your address and on?<br /><br />Also, bonus question. Is LE able to offer a front of bud or samples to get addresses?

				For bulk amounts maybe, so they can catch out a dealer, but I would say there&#039;s no way they would besending out small amounts for personal use to catch out users, especially if they ship overseas.

				Of course they can. LEO/NARCOS can sit down with you on your couch light up a j and smoke it with you. LEO/NARCOs have very little restraints.<br /><br />You can for sure lose a lot of sleep thinking about all of the hypothetical situations but if you do your due diligence you can make purchases with little to no risk. There is always a risk... SR just tries to mitigate most of them but there is still a risk.<br /><br />

				Yes LE can break any law they want to in order to make a drug bust. A friend of mine spent years in federal prison after his partner who shot up heroin with him and worked together smuggling in millions of ecstacy pills into the US, stealing tractor trailers together to use them to transport drugs TURNED OUT TO BE AN LE UNDERCOVER AGENT!! They did everything together! they were working together for a year and half and in one day it was over just like that. <br />So when ppl say that LE cant break any laws in order to bust someone, I would take that with a grain of salt. Cops dont listen to rules, and if they break a cpl laws here and there, the DA wont prosecute the DEA agent who helped bring down this &quot;kingpin&quot;

				They can for a short period of time. But they would have to make a bust immediately after the receiver got the product. They couldn&#039;t just start vending here long term in some bigger play to hit SR. Not happening. They can&#039;t just start introducing narcotics into circulation long term. Iran contra and the Afghan/Soviet war dope debacles were a different story. That was intelligence agencies and international military backed covert operations. The CIA is not going to start vending coke and molly and pot on SR. If the DEA/FBI/local le does it, it will be VERY controlled. <br />Imagine if they started introducing kilos of heroin and coke and meth into the streets and somebody blew the whistle. Would make the Fast &amp; Furious gunrunning look like a walk in the park.

				I agree that LE does whatever the hell it wants to do - then lies about it later if they need to. The question to ask, though, is WOULD they send you drugs in the mail. I say there is almost zero possibility of that happening. <br /><br />Why would they do it? LE sending drugs to someone would not be a low-level cop&#039;s random individual decision. Setting up a vendor account and sending drugs out would be some sort of high level committee approval deal with all kinds of people signing off on it. I could see that sort of activity if it was geared toward taking down a major dealer or SR as a whole, but sending 1/2 oz of nugs to you would not advance that cause much. They already know that SR is a criminal enterprise, so there&#039;s nothing to prove there, and busting individual users for small deals is about as inefficient as it gets since there would be no practical way to connect the busted user back up the chain to the big suppliers. <br /><br />Our exposure is in the possibility of a mailed package being identified and intercepted. It happens, but that&#039;s way less risk than all of us would take out on the streets dealing and using. One of the things I respect most about SR is the volume of communication between and among users and vendors regarding packaging and shipping. This is some much larger of a community than is ever possible in face-to-face life, and the ability to learn and to share best practices is a huge benefit. We have a significant chance of staying ahead of LE because of it.<br /><br />I hope...

				yea ok its nice to speculate about you think what they may or may not do but the facts are that the government gave the mexican cartels a shitload of assault rifles and weapons in order to trace the distribution of them or watever and then &quot;lost track&quot; of them somehow and they fell into the hands of cartels who used them to kill american border officers.<br />and this was a long term project that was supposed to track the weapons.<br />My point is, what makes you so confident they wouldnt try the same on SR?<br />Thats why I personally wont buy any amounts worth over 1000 or 2000 USD on SR, they can only catch the big dealers on here, they dont have the resources to bust everyone.<br />but maybe i&#039;m just being paranoid..

Makes perfect sense to stay within your comfort level. Some people are willing to risk more, some people are not.

[and I would like to note that F&amp;F, a plan which was vetted by the highest levels of LE, was totally fucked up, so that&#039;s a consideration when you&#039;re thinking about how much skill LE has at carrying out complicated operations]&nbsp; As I stated, I don&#039;t put an operation to take down SR as whole beyond the possibility of what LE might do. The point I was trying to make was that mailing drugs to us as individuals wouldn&#039;t accomplish that goal, so I see no possibility that LE will do that. I have no clue what they might do if they decide to take down SR as a whole, but it wouldn&#039;t be that, and I am personally not worried that LE is shipping drugs to me.<br /><br />More likely in my view, is that they will attack by somehow screwing up the bitcoin system. If they outlawed cryptocurrency, we&#039;d have an exponentially harder time getting our money in and out (and it&#039;s already a pain in the ass now).&nbsp; The other logical targets are the big vendors, and who knows what LE might come up with. The vendors have to trust the anonymity of the darknet and SR, and they have to be paranoid about stealth and shipping methods. All respect to them for bearing this risk, although for a vendor, the SR risk seems far less that the risk of dealing on the street.
