				I&#039;m sure many of you know about the NSA and their plans to intercept every byte of data that is broadcast through the world-wide web. My question is, will this affect the safety of using Silk Road?<br /><br />What precautions should I take once September rolls around?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				As various analysts have pointed out, too much data is as useless as too little data. If they are planning to intercept every byte (which I haven&#039;t heard, but let&#039;s say it&#039;s true), they will most likely have to filter 99% to find the signal in the porn.<br />

				Well every things is apparently all recorded NOW. This would mean that you shouldn&#039;t use a browser that can show your ISP your IP address accurately. And you need to use a computer that you periodically overwrite to destroy incidences of &#039;law breaking&#039;, or maybe a diskless computer, like a Live copy of some security editions of linux, Tails and others. You should disconnect your buys here from each other so if you&#039;re busted for one, that they don&#039;t have all of your buy info. You should use PGP in communications that are sensitive (all by themselves, like names and addresses) to dealers on the SR. You need to be aware that your phone (even &#039;dumb&#039; phones are constantly &#039;triangle aided&#039; to get a rough idea of where you are at all times when the battery is in your phone) You should keep interested in things like RFID&#039;s which are evolving. And in other similar &#039;distruptive&#039; technologies. <br />Hell, I don&#039;t know where you start to stop!<br />Although there are a lot of &#039;us&#039; users, and individually we&#039;re not important, in future who knows? Might be a law where they allow you to pay some money for each felony you can be proved to commit-&#039; Let&#039;s make a deal&#039;.

				You should probably even make periodic changes in &#039;identities&#039; HERE, so info accidentally recorded (like mentioning a state or part of the world that you live in-for example) can&#039;t be used with other mistakes you make making you LESS anonymous<br />I&#039;d love to hear some other opinions that are not of my paranoid ramblings, it&#039;s a time to think and not make changes until you KNOW what your doing &#039;wrong&#039; in your security. . <br />And of course I&#039;m sure SR has it&#039;s own section in the NSA (or who ever&#039;s) database nothing written on here will ever be &#039;lost&#039;.
