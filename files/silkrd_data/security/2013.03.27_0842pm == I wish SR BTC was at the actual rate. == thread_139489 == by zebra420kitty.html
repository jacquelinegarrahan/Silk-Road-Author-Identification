				I noticed yesterday that when btc is on&nbsp; a rise sr lags behind and also just in general. BTC are currently worth 84.02 USD. Well on Blockchain.info they are at 88.2 BTC. I want to make a few hundred dollar purchase but that would be retarded because i can wait how ever long it takes to get to where it actually is and i will make around $30. But its not actually making $30 Its money that i should already have, but because sr lags behing the actual rate.

				SR matches the weighted average of https://mtgox.com/ . Prevents big fluctuations in price like last week(?) where btc moved $10 +- throughout the day.

				The only reason you wish this is because Bitcoins are rising in value compared to dollars pretty much constantly.<br /><br />If Bitcoins were consistently losing value compared to dollars--say, dropping $1 per day--you would be saying &quot;I wish SR would take longer to catch up to the actual rate&quot; so that your Bitcoins would be worth their current value for longer, instead of losing value right away.<br /><br />If you want to buy drugs, then buy drugs.&nbsp; If you want to get returns on your Bitcoins, then you have to hold on to them for longer while their value is rising.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was getting set up to make a big purchase here on SR--bought the coins, but decided to hold off (this was a few weeks ago).&nbsp; Now, with what my coins are worth after the recent run-up, I can make that huge purchase, cash out the rest of my coins, and have more money than I put in.&nbsp; The way things are going now, patience really does pay.

				I, too, wish that the SR rate followed the actual market rate when it was going up, and lagged far behind when it was going down.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things don&#039;t go like this-<br />It&#039;s fair both ways, you can either make a huge profit, or a huge loss.<br />(Usually, though you end up with a profit. As a vendor, anyways.)<br />
