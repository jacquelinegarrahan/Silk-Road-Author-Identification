				Hey I&#039;m to SR and using Bitcoins,<br /><br />I plan to make my first order, which will be 1g of weed from a trusted seller,<br />I plan to do the following to acquire my bitcoins,<br />Please note that I am residing in Europe (FR) thus moneypak is out of the question,<br /><br />1) Create Paxum account (they will want my ID and proof of residence)<br />2) Fund with my own credit card<br />3) Fund money from Paxum to MtGox account<br />4) Trade money for bitcoins with MtGox account<br />5) &quot;Wash&quot; it by sending the bitcoins to instawallet<br />6) Instawallet to SR account<br />7) Place order<br /><br />I realized that Paxum will have my identity and MtGox will have my email but wouldn&#039;t the instawallet part make it secure?<br />Also I read that SR shuffles the bitcoins after transactions.<br />Am I putting a big risk on myself? Is there a better way to do it/<br /><br />P.S. I will be only purchasing amounts in 1g for extra safety.

REALLY BAD IDEA BRO! dont use anything that ties you to the bit coin. i HIGHLY recommend using get-bitcoin.com an pay in CASH. you can make an order on get-bitcoin.com an go into the bank an pay in cash. if you cant use get-bitcoin to pay in cash, then i would use another bit coin site that you can pay in cash. i HIGHLY recommend against using anything that ties you to the bit coin AT ALL bro. hope i helped bro.

If you&#039;re gonna be worried about using it, you may as well just post cash to the vendor? <br /><br />

				Vandalay<br />For sure you have published more then needed info on public forum.&nbsp; ::)<br />That is not good to do! Gather info from here and decide on your own.<br />Just see how much info you have presented here, cc, weed, amounts, country, exact course of action....<br /><br />If you doubt your methods and need confirmation from strangers then you better off the SR.<br />Be smart enough to know what to do and how to do without everybody knowing what and how.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Is it so hard to find 1g weed in Fr from dealer?
