				Hi,<br /><br />Was wondering what people think about using vendors with no PGP?<br /><br />I personally do not think I would send my details without PGP but it looks like loads of people don&#039;t use it as there is a lot of business done with vendors who don&#039;t have a PGP key listed.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t use a vendor without PGP but what do you all think about it - do people not bother as SR is meant to encrypt all information anyway?<br /><br />REM

				Ran into that situation earlier, MrEvergreen or an international vendor Reich for mxe. Went with Reich due to the fact MrEvergreen didn&#039;t have pgp. With all the pgp software out there, and even online applets, I don&#039;t think there is an excuse to not use it.

				I would be extremely uncomfortable ordering from anyone that didn&#039;t use PGP, and like CrunchyFrog said, who knows what else they might be lax about if they don&#039;t use encryption.

				For a while, I was using Privnote and TorMail to conduct business. So glad that I took the minimal effort to learn PGP. It&#039;s so easy, I&#039;m embarrassed that I agonized over learning it. <br /><br />But to the question of vendors who do not use PGP, everyone has a point in saying that they may also be deficient in other matters of security. Though, some vendors are old school and are used to old school methods of security that have stood the test of time. So I don&#039;t know if I wouldn&#039;t use a vendor who doesn&#039;t have a public PGP key. All depends on the vibe I get from reading their profile page. If I get a sense that they are professional, discreet, and take self preservation seriously, I&#039;d be inclined to transact.

				It happened twice that I added something to cart, went to copy the seller&#039;s public key, but found nothing. No sale.<br /><br />BUT: I took the time to educate them, one of them has already installed the necessary stuff with my help and I placed the order.<br />
