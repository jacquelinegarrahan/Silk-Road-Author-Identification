				I don&#039;t know about you guys, but this is something I have spent thousands of hours pouring thought into...Whether you buy on SR and sell in real life, or buy on sr and resell on sr for profit...surely it is never a wise thing to have large quantities of drugs in your house when packages are being delivered. <br /><br />What do you do? Some of the things I&#039;ve thought of to stash large quantities of drugs , that aren&#039;t full proof really, are:<br />*Store in white-van with fake-business label on side. Could store drugs, and/or SR shipping equipment inside.<br />Problem: Long term storage without being toed? Leaving unattended - get broken into? Transport...don&#039;t get pulled over *yikes*.<br /><br />*Rent 2 houses, 1 for storage/packaging, another for receiving packages.<br />Problem: The only thing I am unsure of is whether or not your name goes in a searchable database for feds to look up when you sign a lease, of course if this is the case you could always have another person sign the lease.... but then you have the issue of someone else in your business. Perhaps you could pay the rent on someones house, and in exchange they receive packages and agree to keep silent.<br /><br />*Storage Unit...far too many issues with this:<br />Problem: Random/occasional drug dog sweeps, frequent/daily visits.<br /><br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?

				Could you elaborate? I am open to any ideas. Anything that might potentially work, or rather be safe, secure, and functional.

				People aren&#039;t likely to reveal great ideas and systems that work on a forum thats swarming in LE.<br /><br />Best bet might be just to ask people to PM you, its up to them if they then do that.<br /><br />Cheers

				Tellemetree has a point.... but even something as simple as a place to stash your shit when you&#039;re awaiting on the arrival of an SR order would be nice...I&#039;ve had a few ideas in the past but I hate doing them.

				If you use good practices you should be ok. dont ship to that address etc..<br />but really there is no fool proof way. cause if they are coming after you im sure they <br />will watch for a couple of days,weeks at least{if you are a worthwhile collar for them}<br />so they will prob know your habits already. i would say at a friends house or in magnetic box in <br />a really good spot.

				since this is an international forum, LE reading my tip is not that much of a concern to me. what they gonna do? check all the xxxx mentioned worldwide? and even if... keeping them this busy would already be worth it.. haha.<br /><br />it depends a lot on the area you are in (duh)<br /><br />EG: go to the next hardware shop and buy one of the 3 or 4 square keys. i mean, one where you have 10 or so different keys on there builders use. they are like 20 bucks. you can get 2 different ones. suddenly you have many many options. like a electricity box or a street lamp. some can be opened very easily. in there, you can hide them in a way, that they won&#039;t be found, even if the technician does some work (just look were the potentially could be doing some work). place them into a piece of trash, so if some guy finds them, they are likely to just throw it away. additionally you can prep the lamp from the outside, so you know when it has been opened. so even in worst case scenario (some guy finds it, calls police, they sit there and wait for you) you will see that is has been opened and can just walk by. <br /><br />ive heard of some dealer where you went home to him, said what you wanted and paid. he then showed you pictures of a place in the area you would pick up what you need. never said a word about it. not really working if you are selling $20ies all day, but for the half ounce amounts in a rural area... why not? <br /><br />i guess we are talking about an urban area....? if you share some info, guess I can come up with more ideas.<br />

				I am also interested in this. What are some good stash spots in an apartment. Say for example I put a stash in mylar so that it is harder for a canine to find and somewhere up high. Also is it a good to take a ziploc bag of MJ and wait for the smell to start permeating and rub that all over the apartment so that it they bring in dogs the dogs will false alert all over the place and they will not be able use the dog to search?

There is of course more to it but I dont want to get into more detail on here.&nbsp; Think about it, if you are smart enough to be running operation big enough to afford to do this, then you are smart enough to make it work :)

				you obviously need to pick one, that is not potentially visible to apartment windows or people walking by.<br /><br />and the ones you can open with that kind of tool... you won&#039;t get killed that easily. those are protected much better... unless you are living in russia or something...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />there is much more options than some electro box... get a tool like that and possibilities will open up! might not be the perfect solution for everybody though.
