No idea if you can just use a throw away facebook account or if there&#039;s some sort of bullshit 30-day requirement for that as well. I&#039;d say don&#039;t use it anymore. Start doing cash deposits (anonymous) or just trade with people on the Bitcointalk forums in the Currency Exchange base if you still want to use Dwolla.

				It means if you want to send any dwolla funds to a currency exchange, you have to have had a deposit sitting in your account for 30 days.&nbsp; Just a one time deal i&#039;m sure, but nonetheless.<br /><br />I just purchased bitcoins on get-bitcoin.com.&nbsp; It is not an exchange, but sells at a fixed rate.&nbsp; my dwolla funds were successfully transferred to their account, and they will send the btc&#039;s straight to my SR wallet.&nbsp; wait time is &#039;up too&#039; 24 hours, which is better than waiting on dwolla if time is important.

				any account you send to that has had a previous fraud problem you have to fill this shit out. if you find somebody trading dwolla for bitcoins on a forum somewhere or IRC you won&#039;t have this problem until eventually somebody scams them too and dwolla flags their account for this weird social networking shit.
