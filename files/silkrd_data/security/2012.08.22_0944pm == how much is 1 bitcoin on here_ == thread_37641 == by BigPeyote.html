				$ElevendySevendyTwo.<br /><br />for real man. Log on to SR and check.<br /><br />right NOW 1BTC = $9.86USD. This changes more then a couple times during the day. Plan to deposit/transfer some extra $ and the worse thing that could happen is you end up with some extra coins. Do not try to plan anything to the penny and come up short and then start a begger thread!<br /><br />PS - as of RIGHT NOW $550 = 55.7809331 BTC.<br />

				Where do you find that number? I made my first bitcoin purchase with bitinstant today, and the btc I actually got came to a ratio of 10.51$/btc. They charge plenty of separate &quot;upfront&quot; fees, so I hope they don&#039;t screw you on the $/btc ratio too?

(the +1 probably accounts for the other .01$/btc)
