				^^ lol..<br /><br />Well in all seriousness I would suggest that if you are using a vendor like mrouid then he says he ships it express in different shipments but they require signature, I could be wrong on how he does it tho as ive never purchased that quantity online <br /><br />Best advice i would give is Not to use a PO box, that would be extremely sketchy in many ways unless it is a business PO box which has packages regularly delivered to it. My suggestion would be to send the packages to different locations maybe between friends and as long as it is packaged well I dont see a problem <br /><br />packages get delivered its their job to do so ive heard of people sending 10 packs at a time and it making it through so it all is really just if your willing to risk it, and also since it is a brand new thing obviously your going to be thinking the worst, gets better with time<br /><br />Good luck and hope it works out some of the prices on SR are to hard to say no to!!<br />

				A: You don&#039;t. The 10g rule I have is there for a reason. Obviously that sucks for weed vendors, but that&#039;s not my problem.<br />B: If you&#039;re going ahead anyway then ship to several virtual office addresses with the smallest quantity per package you can. (they&#039;ll sign for packages)<br />C: Buy from an intelligent vendor. Look at the forums.

				without saying how, i know that someone ordered a large consignment of weed and got a card in&nbsp; their letter box, when they got there a leo was wating at the post office.<br /><br />seriously though, for weed, why risk it, there are soooooo many irl weed dealers, its not that hard

				Buy some grow lights, order some seeds, it&#039;s a heck of a lot safer.

				I have had a couple of bulk orders picked up (1lb +) over the past year.&nbsp; It happens, it&#039;s higher risk when you are dealing with parcels because they are more rigorously searched, and the volume is lower than smaller item classes.<br /><br />That being said, it can be done - you just have to be pretty fucking creative.<br /><br />I do recommend splitting stuff up when possible.&nbsp; Every QP I ship is split up into 4 packages and sent over 7-10 days.&nbsp; Every one makes it, every time.&nbsp; Even if one were to get lost, it&#039;s only 25% of the order as opposed to 100%, so it&#039;s a more recoverable situation.&nbsp; I try to ship in 1oz-or-lighter packages when I can.<br /><br />

				Pretty much, don&#039;t. A lot of vendors have trouble getting ounces through, let alone lb&#039;s because weed is just so bulky and smelly.

				I&#039;m hearing interesting things about glass ampoules with vacuum packing in triplicate (&lt;50g) If I were a weed seller, that&#039;s how I&#039;d transport. But OP is a buyer and is unlikely to get to dictate those kinds of terms.
