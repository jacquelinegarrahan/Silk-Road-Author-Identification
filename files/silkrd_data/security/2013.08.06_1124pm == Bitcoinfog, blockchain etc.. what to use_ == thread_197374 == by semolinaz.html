				Looking to make cash deposit&#039;s through localbitcoins &amp; then to SR, what should i use in between? Bitcoinfog looks good but looks as though it takes a long time for things to process properly, how long i dont know for sure though as ive never done it? It also confuses me a bit with all the options when withdrawing &amp; just throws up more questions as to whether i am doing things right or not!<br /><br />&amp;...<br /><br />Blockchain requires java - not good, right?<br /><br />thanks

				I have personally used bitcoinfog before - they do take a while to come through, but always have. <br /><br />I -believe- SR actually has tumbling running behind the scenes (can anyone confirm this?) to obsfucate transactions. The only catch with all these things is that they take time. Unless you explicitly specify, as the network confirms transactions, people running rigs will normally take a small fee off the top (it&#039;s in there as an incentive for people to allocate processing power to doing this). <br /><br />Without people putting processing power towards it, you&#039;d never get those coins turning up post payment! (or it would take a -very- long time)

				I just thought of an idea that could skip Bitcoinfog (and thus skip the wait and potential 3% fee).&nbsp; &nbsp;Create a localbitcoins account, &quot;sell them&quot; to a few fake buyers (you) created from tor (1% fee), move the coins to an anonymous online wallet (again from Tor), then move them to SR?&nbsp; &nbsp;This would at least give you a story.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to explain what happens to my bitcoins when they go to bitcoinfog.&nbsp; Maybe I don&#039;t need to... but I&#039;m not sure?

				ok then, the fog it is.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies<br /><br />oh, also is it really needed to split the withdraw up into lots of different smaller payments? &lt; considering as well that my initial purchase of the coins will be a bank cash deposit?

				so let me get this right... I send the washed coins to 2 or more different addresses in my SR account &lt; so i assume it&#039;s possible to have multiple addresses in my SR account at one time ?<br /><br />thanks &amp; I appreciate the help.

				Thanks for that NickNack although I worded my question wrong! I meant to ask I didn&#039;t understand how the multiple withdrawls work, not deposits.&nbsp; ie.. sending money from bitcoinfog to SR in multiple smaller amounts. If you can do this, ie split your withdrawl up into smaller multiple amounts over to SR, then you need multple wallet addresses in SR to receive them in SR right ? <br /><br />Or, is it the case that you send all of the split up withrawls to only one wallet address at SR and wait for the total to tot up once they gradually arrive ?<br /><br />Also, yeah alot of advice has been that tumbling after making a cash deposit is not needed, but then i read in a few other places that it&#039;s still good to tumble even if you&#039;ve done it like this initially with a cash deposit. So much conflicting info I thought id just take the safest option!<br /><br />Thanks for all the advice

				so yeah, put a bit more clearly:<br /><br />When making a withdrawal from bitcoinfog to SR the option is to split the withdrawal up into smaller multiple payments, you then have to enter all the addresses that you want these smaller payments to go to. In SR it appears you can only have one address at a time to send bitcoins to. This confuses me. Please help!
