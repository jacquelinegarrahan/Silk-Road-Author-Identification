				This is probably just me being stupid, but when I try to transfer coins from my wallet in strongcoin to silkroad, they don&#039;t seem to get sent...<br /><br />Strongcoin gives me two options: &quot;Send Payment&quot; and &quot;Transfer Funds&quot;, but by the looks of it, &quot;transfer funds&quot; only sends money between different accounts within the same wallet, and therefore presumably I have to use &quot;Send Payment&quot;... which is what I did... several days ago... but the money is still in my wallet, and not in my SR account. So I went ahead and got a new SR address to send to, and repeated the payment, and it still hasn&#039;t sent; I now have two listed outgoing payments, both for just under the amount I have in my wallet. Can somebody explain to me whats going on?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Wotsits

				Its been having issues for about two weeks. I talked to the site owner and he said that it a problem with the blockchain he is using. He did not say when a fix would be available so heres what I did.<br />I exported a paper copy of my wallet and transfered all of the funds using the Armory wallet. It was fairly straight forward even for a noob. Hope that helps!<br /><br />FIsh
