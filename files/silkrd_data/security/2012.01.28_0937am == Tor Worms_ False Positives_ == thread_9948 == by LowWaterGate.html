				I just installed Prevx v3.0.5.220 and its initial malware scan ID&#039;d a dozen worms, all in the 2 address folders named:&nbsp; &quot;tor browser v.2.2.35-4&quot; &amp; &quot;tor browser v.2.2.35-3&quot; .<br /><br />They were executables as follows:<br /><br />testopen.exe<br />testserve.exe<br />testfile.exe<br />testpipe.exe<br />certutil.exe<br />readntim.exe<br /><br />The 6 were duplicated in each folder for a total of twelve.&nbsp; I&#039;m 99% certain that they are false positives.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to hear from a tor mod/expert re any wormesque problems they&#039;ve seen attributable to the aforementioned files.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />LowWater<br />

				If you have downloaded it from the Tor website you&#039;re probably good.<br /><br />Double check:<br />http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=268723

				randomOVDB#2,<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to think about my dilemma.&nbsp; I read your Wilder&#039;s thread and sent my Prevx log off to report@prevxresearch.com (just in case).&nbsp; Having downloaded the browser from https://www.torproject.org/ I&#039;m not too worried but I&#039;m a security freak.&nbsp; Anyway . . .<br /><br />Take Care,<br />LowWater

I would also recommend that you start verifying the GnuPG signature of the TBB that you download from the Tor Project website, just to make sure that you&#039;re getting the real version of the software.

Don&#039;t trust anyone on SR to do it for you.

Make sure you also download the signature file (the one with a filename ending in .asc). You can then use both files (the executable plus the signature) to verify that no one has tampered with the package you just downloaded.<br /><br />Once that&#039;s done, go ahead and extract the archive and run Tor as normal. If Privex is still bitching about malware, turn it off or simply uninstall and install something better.

				Supersecretsquirrel, thanks.<br /><br />You gave me the same advice as Tor&#039;s tech support.&nbsp; To make a long story short they were false positives and I whitelisted them so that Prevx doesn&#039;t bitch every fifteen minutes.&nbsp; Considering I run Eset NOD32 and Malwarebytes and have been for years, I was a bit surprised that only Prevx was sensitive enough to find a simple worm.<br /><br />Again, thanks for all your help.&nbsp; From my still uninfected computer - <br /><br />Take Care,<br />LowWater
