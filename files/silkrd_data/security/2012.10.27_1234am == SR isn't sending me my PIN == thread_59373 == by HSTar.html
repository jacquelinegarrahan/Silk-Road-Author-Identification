				So I have an important purchase to make that I really wanna get by Halloween (some 2C-B), but SR isn&#039;t sending me the message to et me create a new PIN, it&#039;s been almost 5 days, and I&#039;ve sent numerous replies to their message (particularly since the 3 day mark that the FAQ mentions). WHat the fuck? This is really starting to piss me off!

				Thanks I guess. I guess I was confused because the FAQ said after three days, and a message they sent me said four, and now this thread says seven. It might help to pick a consistent time, stick with it, and make sure you tell people that. As frustrating as this is it only gets more frustrating when trying to make a purchase by a certain time, and repititively logging in to check for a message that I guess isn&#039;t coming for another two days or something.

				So since you don&#039;t have a pin I suggest taking the time to read posts like<br />&quot;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try to be patient you guys. We had some issues beyond our control and now we are working around the clock to get caught up. I am putting my life on hold until I can get back to each and every one of you. But the more messages that come piling in the longer its going to take me to answer them all. I know its frustrating to not be able to use your account but I can assure you this kind of back-up won&#039;t happen again and we will respond to you as soon as possible. Just take a deep breath and find a way to keep your mind off of it until we get to you. Better yet, join us in DPR&#039;s book club and get caught up with what we are currently reading. That should keep you occupied AND mentally stimulated&quot;<br />\<br />Take the time to read the forums and if you are having technical difficulties try posting in that section in the future even better read the sticky about pins. sending multiple messages about the ssame problem just backlogs supports effort to help out even more..&nbsp; &nbsp;It sucks not to have a pin but this is an ongoing topic on the forums if you have been part of this community you would be aware of what is happening in it.<br />
