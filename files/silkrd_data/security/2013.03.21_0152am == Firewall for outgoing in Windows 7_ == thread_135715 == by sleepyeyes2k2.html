				This is where I&#039;m jealous of Mac users, because they can use a program called &quot;Little Snitch&quot; (I think) that allows them to set profiles and block outgoing internet traffic based on the profile settings.&nbsp; there&#039;s a few dozen such proggies that do that for Windows, and I&#039;ve gone through a few that I hate, mostly because I can&#039;t set up obvious profiles (like &quot;Allow All&quot;, &quot;Tor/Proxied Only&quot;).&nbsp; I must confess that the reason I want this is not purely because I am super-anal about security (well, maybe that&#039;s part of it).&nbsp; It&#039;s because I love music, and I want to play iTunes while doing whatever, but you can&#039;t put iTunes in an offline mode, so I can&#039;t use it while I&#039;m running Tor, not safely.&nbsp; And, I want my tunes, man.<br /><br />So, is anyone using such a program that you actually like?&nbsp; Please share, if so.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to know!<br /><br />

				I may be wrong, but &quot;Windows Firewall with Advanced Security&quot; may be what you are looking for, just go to the Win7 Start Menu and type in the search box &#039;firewall&#039;, it will come up in the results.<br /><br />In this Management Console, you can set up a plethora of Inbound and Outbound firewall rules for whatever programs you want.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

A common Windows 7 installation itself got so many leakages...<br />If you want to walk the tinfoil way, buy a cheap old second hand notebook and use it for Tor related things only.

				You could check the Windows firewall with the in Win 7 integrated resource monitor (network tab) or better - wireshark!<br />http://www.wireshark.org/<br />(I would have more sorrows about the 9000 services, that are running by default)<br /><br />Again: Old cheap notebook + tails = less worries/stress.<br />

				Wireshark is great, but it&#039;s not a firewall, just packet capture.&nbsp; It&#039;s the thing that tells me I need a firewall.&nbsp; It&#039;s also the thing that tells me Windows 7 isn&#039;t giving me away to the world when I use Tor or when I proxy.&nbsp; Packet Capture is another great diagnostic tool.&nbsp; But, that&#039;s all they do.&nbsp; Diagnose.<br /><br />
