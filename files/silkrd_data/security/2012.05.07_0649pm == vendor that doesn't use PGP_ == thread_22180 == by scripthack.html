				I was thinking of purchasing 5 pills of dmtdoodeelsd&#039;s Molly, but the vendor has said &#039;we don&#039;t have a PGP, don&#039;t ask..&#039;. Their reviews seem to be all positive, but I&#039;ve never ordered without using PGP before. Is it safe to order without it? Or should I just leave it..

				dmtdoodeelsd used to use PGP a month or so ago. I see they provide a link to privnote.com. Why not create a note with your address in and send them the link in the address field when ordering? The note self destructs as soon as they have finished reading it and privnote say they don&#039;t keep a log of the IPs used to create the notes. Seems quite secure considering you will be accessing it through TOR anyway and privnote wont know what the note is for&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If you are still unsure about using privnote, then read their privacy policy here: https://privnote.com/privacy/<br /><br />Hopefully that should put your mind at ease.

				Ahh thats a shame. I was hoping privnote would be an acceptable alternative to PGP. Mainly because I like the look of dmtdoodeelsds Aphet and it would be domestic. It seems more lurking is required as opposed to taking &quot;privacy&quot; websites on face value.

				Well excuse us...&nbsp; we do apologise for the fact we are not computer savvy - we tried to get to grips with PGP a while ago, but it seems like much ado about nothing tbh... <br /><br />i think the only reason people should use PGP is to send addresses as apparently it is a balls-ache just to open a message which is encrypted... and not just that, the only way anyone who sends their address in the normal way is EVER gonna get caught, is if the whole of silk Roads servers get hacked and the whole website goes down - and if that happens do you think the LEO are gonna be fussed with a few individual consumers psotal addresses..!?!?!?<br /><br />they want to bring down the administrators of the site, maybe some unlucky vendors, but really, guys, you think you are that important to get followed or tracked or get observation put on you for ordering a few pills or whatever from an underground website , which you have to use TOR for anyway..?!?!!? <br /><br />it seems to me we will get more customers when i eventually get time to get my head round it all - but until that time, we are not offering PGP atm... but that is not effecting the contstant stream of happy customers we have all round Europe... feel free to order in the original, conventional way, you have notihng to fear except the truth people ... ;-)<br /><br />increase da peace xx

				@dmtdoodeelsd<br />Speaking only for myself, I will always pass up a vendor who isn&#039;t willing/able to use PGP. Although I agree with you that it doesn&#039;t increase my risk a whole lot. The reason it sketches me out is far more about what it says about the vendor. It says, &quot;I can&#039;t take the time to figure out a fairly simple computer problem&quot;, or, &quot;I&quot;m too lazy to take two (at most) extra minutes to make your transaction a little more secure&quot;.<br /><br />Either way, it makes me question how careful you are about the rest of your (&quot;you&quot; being any vendor that doesn&#039;t/won&#039;t use PGP) operation. Considering the nature of what we&#039;re buying and selling here, just a little doubt is enough for me to look for someone else, even if it means I&#039;d have to pay a little bit more. And I don&#039;t see the argument of, &quot;Well, I have tons of happy customers&quot; as being especially valid. Just because nothing bad has happened yet, don&#039;t mean you&#039;re not running a really sloppy operation. It just means you have a bunch of customers who care more about getting drugs than being safe.<br /><br />I&#039;m not one to criticize without offering a solution, so if you&#039;d like, feel free to PM me, and I&#039;ll try and help you get set up with PGP.

				Really?&nbsp; Man, it&#039;s not that hard.&nbsp; Hell, if you don&#039;t want to learn how to use it, download portable pgp.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t be any easier (although, for a vendor, I wouldn&#039;t recommend the program, but for a buyer, it&#039;s good enough).&nbsp; At least people would feel some level of security dealing w/ ya.&nbsp;

				Limetless, you cannot possibly be as digitally spasticated as us i mean you offer Money Laundering/Specialist Electronics/Lab Equipment etc... we only provide good old fashioned, high grade intoxicants, no mistaking ....<br /><br /><br />i tried to download a pgp thing asnd get my head round it, most of them seemed to be free then tried to charge me, i eventally got summat installed for free and generated a key ( i think) and then was blinded by all this technology and put it on the back burner so to speak...<br /><br />it is something i will try and get my head around again when i get bk but as i explain in previous post, is not somethig integrally necessary within the operation of SR... yes i concede we will get more customers when it is active, but it took so much of my time and seemed like it takes longer to encrypt and decrypt every message (i think - i never got that far!)<br /><br />it takes us long enough to operate on SR + RW which is the main thing for us...<br /><br />any ideas or advice from anyone is gratefully received /appreciated...<br /><br />basically i need some one who has got it running successfully to sit down with me and talk me through it (not literally obviously!) hahah <br /><br />&nbsp;:-[ :-[ :-[ xxx

				thank you Chuck and Limetless for the detailed idiots proof guide, i will have a go at this as soon as i have worked out any difference procedure for a mac (haha yes mac user = c*nt!).?<br /><br />like i say i did manage to install GPG Keychain access, i have jus generated my secret key, not sure what to do with it now..? how do i generate public key? which one do i post on my profile..? (public i am assuming) in your walk through guise the public key is the 1st one generated..?<br /><br />but when i generated it it said &#039;generate key pair&#039; - so i am assuming it is a public and private keys, then how do i separate them..??<br /><br />hang on , after trying to generate each key it asks me to enter passphrase (which i do , obv something different to other passwords - in case anyone is judging my &#039;sloppy operation&#039; @banjo!!)<br /><br />it then comes up with error box says:-<br /><br />&#039;Send keys failed!<br />Code = 0&#039;<br /><br />but then the key is listed in the list as a secret key...??<br /><br />oh dear.. struggling..?&nbsp; :( :( :(<br />

				I use SR, TrueCrypt, and some other sophisticated security stuff and also think PGP is a ball-ache to use. I have no doubt i could learn to use it but it has always seemed completely redundant on SR to me. To be frank the whole PGP thing is a clumsy, poorly designed and user unfriendly piece of kit. If they have your address from the order form then that is the least of your worries. seeing as how the end result of this security is the address being physically printed in plain English on a piece of paper.

Mac is for the simplest of people so I&#039;m sure you would guess they provide many programs that allow you to do EXACTLY what you want them to do.<br /><br />My suggestion if you are still struggling is to get a buddy round who knows his way around a computer and get him to install parallels for you. All the stuff you need is readily available on torrents (ubuntu, parallels) etc...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dank

				if i recall this &quot;bosshogg&quot; vendor doesn&#039;t use pgp either. i sure as hell don&#039;t trust any vendor that doesn&#039;t use it, I spent hours myself trying to figure it out (and posted several threads lol), and i&#039;m just an occassional user. for a vendor to not use pgp, he or she would have to be out of their mind IMO.

As stated in his profile, he hates it. That, and the fact that he&#039;s constantly joking and took something like 18 pages in his own thread to even mention what products he offers makes me unwilling to touch him with a 10 foot pole.<br /><br />If a vendor doesn&#039;t want to use PGP, that&#039;s up to them. But I know I speak for more than myself when I say they&#039;re losing business because of it.

				I don&#039;t think you should be able to sell on this site without having a public key<br />with that said BossHogg1 is a reliable vendor (i have done business with him before)<br /><br />The problem exists when servers and/or sellers computers get compromised by LEO <br />and massive lists of purchase information is gathered<br /><br /><br />and remember folks.. as soon as LEO has your private key === GAME OVER

You could also post it to each product listing page for more visibility. And people who don&#039;t want / care to use PGP... well, you can&#039;t make them. It&#039;s your choice to reject their orders, though - it potentially exposes you since there&#039;s buyers&#039; unencrypted addresses floating around. Who knows who can see them?
