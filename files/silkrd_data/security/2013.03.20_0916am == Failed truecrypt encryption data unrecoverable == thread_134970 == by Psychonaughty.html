				Hi,<br /><br />I have one big drive with 100% bitlocker encryption and decided to also truecrypt encrypt it. This was a stupid idea because it took way too long.<br />Now at 95% it sais it can not encrypt any further and when I check for automatic continuation of encryption it sais that there is nothing to encrypt.<br /><br />I can not find any ways of stopping encryption, or decrypting...<br /><br />So probably all my files will be lost now? FBI and CIA can do many things to recover data, but I can not. Last time I checked I could not even get data back that was on a stick and quick formatted. Just some random -not- working files.<br />So what is good software for recovery?? Easuspro doesn&#039;t do anything<br /><br />Any ideas on how to solve this issue? ::)

				Come on guys. 100% bitlock encrypted, now unencrypted.<br />99.5% truecrypt encrypted without format stuff (only the first 4% or so).<br /><br />How to recover data from a disk?? Especially this one!?

				I just saw a video of this software called &#039;spin rite&#039;. It sounds like it might work for you. It costs $90, but there seem to be a lot of testimonials to how good it is. https://www.grc.com/intro.htm Another place you could check out are the TrueCrypt forums. I never could get much response there, but I&#039;m kind of impatient. I lost some data through TrueCrypt too. I had a hidden partition and a regular partition and I got rid of the encryption (I think) of the hidden partition (there is only one way to do it, but I forget which is which) by &#039;permanently decrypting&#039; the disk. It took about 12 hours, and then I was done and I couldn&#039;t find anything! It was like the partition disappeared. Anyway, if I do TrueCrypt again, I&#039;ll make sure to have a backup plan. It&#039;s also important to have a backup disk, a couple of times I had problems starting the computer and had to use the back up disk to fix it.
