				Hey,<br />Based in EU, i used to get my bitcoins via mtgox, SEPA bank transfer.<br />I&#039;d like now to change my habit. <br />What would be the best way to get bitcoins within europe - not in UK ?<br /><br />Western Union, Moneygram?<br />I don&#039;t know how it works, i can&#039;t find any info about it here.<br /><br />I would appreciate any advice.<br />Also, which vendor (if i need one) is reliable?<br /><br />Thanks !

				Yeah if you can use moneygram then bitinstant is pretty easy.&nbsp; There are a ton of posts on how to use it or if you search an engine like startpage for &quot;How to use bitinstnt&quot; there are youtube videos detailing the procedure as well as text guides.

				I too have been looking for other ways to getting BTC, away from bitinstant. I always feel like they&#039;re ripping me off and I&#039;m not getting my money&#039;s worth... If you live outside the US it&#039;s gets easier to get coins I would imagine as the US have all these laws which keeps the exchanges overseas from dealing with the US base customers.<br /><br />Best way I think if you live overseas is to setup an account with perfect money, webmoney, OKKASH, etc and have money wired, some even accept WU or MG, some even have cash deposit stations to fund those accounts. You then use those accounts to fund whichever exchange you plan on using. You just have to really sit down and research all the possibilities.

				i also live in the EU (not UK), i am buying my coins with localbitcoins.com and SEPA bank transfer, after i have them in my localbitcoins.com wallet i send them to my offline wallet and then i send them to SR. this takes me one day to get my coins to SR. <br /><br />I dont know anything about Moneygram / Western Union and the like, but after you bought them you could send them to a bitcoin laundering service (like bitcoinfog, access it through tor), after that you should be good, but i dont think that this is even necessary!

				yeah i know, may also depend on where you live, i have heard that in Austria for example you can buy prepaid mastercards (up to 150 euro) without any id. You could send them afterwards to virwox, there you should get linden dollars with your mastercard and then you could change them to bitcoins, but i think there are a lot of fees and it is not the fastest way.... and i dont know if you could spend your prepaid mastercard anywhere else to make it easier <br /><br />or you could try your luck with localbitoins.com via cash transfer (face2face)

				Why don&#039;t you use LocalBitcoins and simply meet with the vendor or send someone?
