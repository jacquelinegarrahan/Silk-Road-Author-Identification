				Question for SR Vets<br /><br />How secure and what precautions should I deal with when it comes to using/purchasing/redeeming Money Packs?<br /><br />I have used them in the past through a visa debit system and it worked fine<br /><br />however i would like more detailed info on handling them<br /><br />I&#039;ve read mixed reviews-some great to very bad<br /><br />would really appreciate some real-time feedback<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				i am no sr vet but have some insight as i tend to spend a lot of time thinking about what ifs. if you are able to go out of your way to take precautions then here it is.<br />moneypaks all have their own unique code: it can more than likely be tracked to a specific store<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this store can more than likely find the time of the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transaction. and more than likely can access the cam<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the specific register at the specific time. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suggestion: some sort of disguise ie: regular clothes so you blend in but long <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sleve and pants. if you dont wear a watch, wear one that day. drive to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nearest town not your own and park away from walmarts parking lot. ect<br />redeeming is hard to cover up unless it ends in cash without going through any roads with your<br />name painted above a 16 digit card number. lol thought about it... and unless u are good and dont have ur hands in the cookie jar no 100% safe way i can think of. now selling coins and what not... wtfe... ud get in about as much trouble as selling car wash tokens. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; buying and using easy... recieving for substance purchase idk... <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lol now i feel stupid for asking sellers to take moneypak... <br />hope any or my ramblings made sense

				if there is a prepaid visa that can be loaded with em i would recommend that the same precautions as buying moneypaks be taken but at say a gas station. when doing atm withdraw use atm at night and walk to it as they have cameras too. this would just be like carrying a giant broom around tho. i figure those trying to be inconspicuous will just stand out. personally on here i will go by the rep and thats it... lol not safe but neither is cooking meth in your back yard. lol i probably was never caught cause i was sitting in the middle of my driveway had i been hiding out in the country somewhere in an old trap house disguised as a tool shed. some one would wonder what in the hell i was doing in that tool shed for so long and why i&nbsp; alwayse smelt like cat piss lol. long story short thats why im here cause its crazy either way. let someone else make it and buy it here. :) be careful just not conspicuously careful
