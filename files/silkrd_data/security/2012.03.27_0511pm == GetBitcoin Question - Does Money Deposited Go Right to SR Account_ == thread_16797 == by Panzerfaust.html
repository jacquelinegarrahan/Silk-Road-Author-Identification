				Sorry if this is stupid question but I just wanted to confirm something, this GetBitcoin company, they accept deposits at Bank of America which is very convienent for me.&nbsp; I just wanted to make sure that once I make a deposit the funds are then put into my SR account directly... in other words I don&#039;t need a 3rd party company like Dwolla to &quot;receive&quot; the money, then finally &quot;send&quot; to my SR account??<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any responses. =)&nbsp; &nbsp;:) :) :)

				Forgive me if I&#039;ve read this wrong, but you might wish to familiarize yourself with bitcoin and how it works before sending anyone any money.<br /><br />When you send funds to get-bitcoin, you also give them bitcoin address in which to deposit your coins. This can be any address that you control. For instance:<br />&nbsp;- An address in your Bitcoin software on your machine<br />&nbsp;- An e-wallet, like Instawallet<br />&nbsp;- A receiving address from your SR account<br />&nbsp;- A receiving address from your Dwolla or MtGox account (I&#039;m not that familiar with services like that, but I assume they work like any other service, providing you with a bitcoin receiving address)<br /><br />You CAN give them the receiving address from your SR account and the coins will go right there, but that&#039;s not recommended. You will want to have them sent somewhere else first and then do some mixing to enhance anonymity.

				Exactly always mix your bitcoins and also send them around to different wallets before going to your target address

				I&#039;d recommend you be cautious about using get-bitcoin. Personally I&#039;ve gone through them twice and they came through both times, but there is a lot of talk lately of people using their services and not getting their coin, and having their emails ignored. It&#039;s unclear whether they have just been having trouble lately or are a selective scam.

I can assure you though, they are all stand up individuals who are just making a days pay. Regardless of how long it takes, THEY WILL ALWAYS COME THROUGH. I mean, I see plenty of people here complaining about taking more than 24 hours to get their coin. On a side note, it is 24 hours after confirmation of payment, which can take 24hours to do. So 48 hours is a more realistic waiting time for bank deposits) I like how Paperchasing put it &quot;This isn&#039;t a McDrug drive through&quot; people these days are just too used to the instant gratification of adding a debit card to an account and getting whatever they want shipped the next day. That obviously isn&#039;t the case here.

				I&#039;d just like to add: I used getbitcoin twice within the past two days. the first time took about 17 hours from bank deposit to coins. the second time, today, took under 3 hours from when I walked into the bank to when I had coins in my pocket. I wouldn&#039;t have any doubts about them.
