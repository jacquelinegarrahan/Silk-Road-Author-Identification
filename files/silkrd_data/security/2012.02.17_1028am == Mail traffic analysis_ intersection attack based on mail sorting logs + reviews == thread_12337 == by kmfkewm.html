				So it has come to my attention that at least some countries use automated mail sorters that are capable of deciphering human written addresses. More importantly, some countries are starting to store databases of all mail routing information. I was told this by a very trusted source, although I am digging around for technical specs of mail sorters right now (love open source intelligence!). This is scary.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say Alice buys a pack from Bob. Bob is known to ship from netherlands. Alice gets the pack with no interception. WOOT. Then Alice leaves feedback on Bob saying that she got her package. Next Alice orders from Carol. Carol ships from New York. Alice gets her package with no interception, and then leaves feedback on Carol. <br /><br />The DEA is not happy. They want Alice to fuck off. So they query mail sorting records and look for everyone who got a package from Netherlands in X time frame around when Alice left a review for Bob, in addition to everyone who got a package from New York around the time frame that Alice left a review on Carol. Lots of people are probably in both of these crowds. Now they intersect these two crowds, and out pops Alices shipping address. <br /><br />My source tells me that he is absolutely certain and knows for a fact that some nations have sorters that log this information. He is not sure about other countries. <br /><br />edit: The person who told me this says it is unlikely that police agencies can (legally) gain access to this information, but that intelligence agencies certainly have access to it. <br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_reader<br />http://www.toshiba.co.jp/sis/en/scd/postal/lsm.htm<br /><br />edit II: hmm maybe police can legally gain access to this information....<br /><br />https://ssd.eff.org/book/export/html/16<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Postal mail.

				Makes sense, reminds me of when I took algebra. <br /><br />Though, the mail service has no way off knowing the person who left the review on NetherlandVendor and the person who left the review on NewYorkVendor are the same person. Last time I checked atleast, buyers names are not put on vendor reviews. <br /><br />This means to find intersecting addresses, they would have to somehow find a way to identify the same buyer on multiple vendors from different countries, else they would have to run some sorting to identify millions of reviews, which is impracticable and is unlikely to even work. <br /><br />Not to mention, most vendors in the states, don&#039;t have written on their profile the state they&#039;re shipping from. <br /><br />There&#039;s to many anonymous variables for them to try to intersect and find buyers effectively.<br /><br /><br />With no way to pinpoint which buyer left which review, they&#039;re stuck trying to cross references sets of 2 reviews(out of millions of reviews), out of millions/billions of people. For all they know the reviews they may be trying to cross references may have been left by people outside of their country.&nbsp; It just is rather impossible for them to accurately pinpoint buyers, unless the buyers name are revealed. Without it they may be stuck trying to cross references two different buyer reviews out of billions of people, which would take hours to come back with results.<br /><br />A metaphore to explain what I&#039;m saying:<br />Think of it as picking 2 matching marbles, out of a bag with over 1 million pairs(2 million marbles) in it, 1 million different pairs. What are the chances of you picking out 2 matching marbles. With that, what are the chances, that after you find 2 matching marbles(which you cant see), are those matching marbles are going to match a marble that someone in your database has. This would take way to long to try to identify if someone else in your area of jurisdiction has these 2 marbles, and even if they do, it would be rather hard to pinpoint if this person is indeed who you are looking for. Maybe you did find a match but the system overlooked it, due to the inaccuracy of the time logs kept on vendor reviews.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m very confident their intersect thing wouldn&#039;t work because SR doesn&#039;t give out enough information about who left what review. To make these even more impossible to work, SR could dilute the recorded time left on vendor reviews. Say only the vendor could see the day that the review was left. After a week, a buyer looking at a vendors profile, could only see the general area of the month a review was left. This would make it nearly impossible to identify the time frame of reviews, let alone match them to other reviews.

				here is current USA federal law regarding mail covers. It doesn&#039;t say anything about not using mail covers for exploratory purposes, so this is clearly just a USPI guideline and not actually enforced by law. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Title 39: Postal Service<br /><br />CHAPTER I: UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE<br /><br />SUBCHAPTER D: ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION<br /><br />PART 233: INSPECTION SERVICE AUTHORITY<br /><br />233.3 - Mail covers.<br /><br />(a) Policy.

				Even if those data points don&#039;t leak when reviews are left they could still do fingerprinting attacks and automatically flag mail to boxes that get mail to them that fits a profile consistent with drug trafficking...for example if an address frequently gets mail from multiple drug source states. There are probably very accurate algorithms that can take mail routing databases and use them to automatically come to a probability that the box is involved with drug trafficking. <br /><br />Best way around this is using multiple fake ID boxes.

				Honestly, I have a hard time believing that LEO would commit the types of resources and creativity you&#039;re describing here for the purposes of identifying purchases. <br /><br />That&#039;s obviously an attitude that flies in the face of &quot;security before all else&quot;, but for personal amounts I&#039;m willing to risk exposure to advanced attacks such as what you describe. <br /><br />But yeah, I&#039;ve had this exact train of thought (mail sorting database that contains comprehensive records of who mailed who when), and for me the easier attack vector is something as simple as &quot;Before 2011, this person never received any USPS packages from California, or from overseas. Since then, they have received dozens. Let&#039;s put intense scrutiny on their packages.&quot; But then I remember that the USPS can barely stay solvent and get the mail delivered on time, and I remember how many other priorities LEO and the USPS have, and I go back to watching TV.

				The resources required for this attack are.....a laptop computer from Wal Mart for doing database queries (approx 200 billion entries per year for USPS) , an algorithm that needs to be made one time, and some input (which is apparently gathered in the normal course of mail sorting anyway, and trivial to store for future analysis, and apparently IS being stored for analysis by various countries).

That is why they use intelligence to narrow in on the areas in which they should focus. According to your (completely retarded) theory, law enforcement wont do these &quot;advanced&quot; attacks because they require &quot;too many resources&quot; (a laptop computer, information that is already being logged and stored for analysis), and instead will do, I assume, more basic attacks (like randomly profile mail?). However, a non retarded person will quickly realize that if law enforcement waste their resources primarily focusing on things with low return (like random mail profiling) they will have less arrests than if they use intelligence to know where to focus their resources (automatically flagging boxes that fit a profile of drug trafficking, determining boxes that fit this profile based off of mail traffic analysis, for example). Now they can focus on packages to these boxes and lo and behold their interception rates are going to significantly rise! Wow, they spent resources in a smart way and got a big return, instead of spending resources in a retarded way (your way) and getting a shit return.

				Ok, now that I know what I&#039;m dealing with, and understand that to you, winning the argument is more important than being in line with reality, I realize that debating with you is pointless. So I&#039;ll offer a few more words, but I really don&#039;t want to get into a TLDR back and forth with you.<br /><br />We&#039;re talking right past each other. You&#039;re describing theories, I&#039;m describing reality. You work with computers all day.

And given how much case law you seem to research, it blows my mind that you haven&#039;t noticed how unsophisticated the &quot;attacks&quot; were in uncovering people who have been busted receiving narcotics in the mail (and how few of them involved USPS compared to private delivery, etc). You also haven&#039;t demonstrated that the postal service will do anything other than confiscate and destroy small amounts, and in fact the opposite seems to be the case (that the policy for small amounts is confiscation and destruction). <br /><br />You can never have perfect security. You should however have an appropriate amount of security for the risk you&#039;re exposed to. <br /><br />And that&#039;s where people like yourself fall into the deep end. The concept of &quot;appropriate amount&quot; is too nebulous for you. So you take things to logical extremes. <br /><br />What would happen when the New York Post finds out the USPS and the FBI are working together to profile every piece of mail being sent in this country, for the purposes of prosecuting misdemeanors? <br /><br />Clearly you don&#039;t understand how the system works. Us powerful white people like to have our drugs. However, we have to pander to the powerful white people who don&#039;t like drugs, so we arrest minorities who do stupid shit and get busted. Whenever a powerful white person gets busted for drugs, it&#039;s because he screwed with the wrong person, not because the postal service is doing intersection attacks. If we find out somebody is starting to go after affluent white people who discretely get their drugs and commit no other crimes, you can be damn sure that effort will mysteriously go away.

				I actually said that if you subtract the (positive) difference between my IQ and average from an average IQ that the resulting IQ would be mentally retarded, and pointed out that you obviously are not (any helpful sort of...) autistic since you couldn&#039;t even keep in your memory something that you had just previously said (the attack being advanced), but I decided that it was kind of mean (and entirely pointless) so I deleted it. <br /><br />Anyway sorry for trying to be helpful, hope that your cognitive dissonance keeps you feeling safe, hopefully people who are not retarded can understand this attack and how simple it is to implement, an take the proper counter measures.

Actually, since it is always a federal crime I think it is always a felony. Hm, seems a felony is anything punishable by one year or more in prison. Hm the least scheduled drugs are punishable by up to one year in prison for getting them in the mail, so it is even a felony to get them via mail. Of course if they decide to prosecute or not is entirely up to them, and you are probably going to get a love letter for Xanax (although on the books you can get up to five years in prison for getting a single xanax tab shipped to you). Still you are retarded if you think getting drugs via mail is a misdemeanor offence. And my guess is if that does happen, people will cheer the law enforcement community and say if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about, that seems to be the general theme. <br /><br />There are local police agencies in USA using lisence plate scanners that keep real time positioning logs of all vehicles in certain cities for traffic analysis. Local police use logs from these to locate burglary suspects (via crowd intersection attacks!!!), find stolen cars, etc. I don&#039;t see people throwing fits about this, or even being aware about it in general, despite the fact that it has been reported on to a limited extent.

I&#039;m not sure how far along your project is, so this may or may not make sense. I don&#039;t mean giving the project to somebody else, I mean giving a small piece of the project to develop to some software house or members of the open source community. Then collecting all the little pieces and integrating it into something nice i.e. you&#039;d be less programmer and more project lead. Division of labour etc. And you could specify the requirements to be as detailed as you like.<br /><br />See, no matter how talented a programmer one might be, there are serious time/financial constraints on an individual that don&#039;t exist for the DEA. So it seems to me, that if you want to get &#039;to the next level&#039;, you&#039;ve got to start organizing capital, financial and human to achieve more complex objectives. Being able to develop such systems would put us permanently ahead of LEO, it&#039;d be a real game changer in this arms race.<br /><br />As for where the capital might come from, I think it would be relatively easy for a group of sellers including myself to create rounds of funding for each piece of the project, in small blocks of say 10k. There could be different types of funding structures, so that the basic skeleton of the system is mandatory to fund, whereas features that the sellers would want could be more of an optional thing, and this way you&#039;ve some customer feedback on the constraints of the system. <br /><br />It&#039;s a rather large idea I frankly don&#039;t right now the time or money to pursue since I&#039;ve so many other projects on, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re in a similar situation, but I think we&#039;ll be talking about this again in the future, it&#039;s the kind of issue that has a recurring tendency to pop up. It always amazes me how financial capital has the potential to turn ideas into realities, and it always impressed me how Linus built his kernel by coordinating the activities of dozens of other programmers he&#039;d never even met.<br /><br />Anyway, food for thought. I&#039;d prefer to fully commit to some R&amp;D program like this and start talking dates, times and dollars but realistically I think I&#039;d only be ready for something like this next year (one must also eat after all!).<br /><br /><br />

				kmfkewm<br /><br />What you are describing, the type of systems and algorithms, may sound simple in theory, but will require a massive amount of computing power. Not to mention, they couldn&#039;t be completely accurate. They can&#039;t just go off of, who recieves packages from drug states.... Every state in the country more than likely recieves thousands of packages from every other state in the country every day. There is so much mail in the system. They can&#039;t profile just on state-state.<br /><br />And as far as profiling packages on how they look.... that&#039;s pretty hard for a vendor who knows what they&#039;re doing. Anyone vendor who knows what they&#039;re doing will package it like the millions of other legit mail parcels in the mail system.<br /><br />As far as tracking this stuff based on when the feedback was left, there are way too many probability and chance of false results coming up. They may narrow the results to a few thousand or few hundred packages... but understand this. There are so many packages in the mail system. They do not have the time, resources, or man power, or will for that matter, to &#039;redflag&#039; all of these possible suspects, because that would mean checkings hundreds or possibly thousands of packages all over the country.<br /><br />Not to mention, checking a single package isn&#039;t the quickest thing. For a dog to pinpoint a package, it can take up to a minute. They don&#039;t have the time to have a dog check and recheck multiple packages over and over again that they suspect. This would put a MAJOR slow down in the mail system, and would cost way way to much to hire the additional man power to do it.<br /><br />The only thing they can reliably go off of, is hoping stupid criminals package their drugs in stupid ways so they can profile the exterior.<br /><br />You must realize the steps required, the time required, the man power, and cost required, to effectively utilize a system as you describe. Even if they do use this algorithm, to pin point people POSSIBLY recieving drugs, based on the states they recieve from(still an incredibly inaccurate way to track it as packages are recieved everywhere from everywhere everyday)... they would need 10-100 dogs, and trained handlers for those dogs are each mail hub in the country, since it takes so long for a dog to pinpoint a drug package from a legit one.. this is because they have to lay multiple legit packages next to suspect ones and allow the dogs to sniff it over and over again before they can get a warrant.<br /><br />It&#039;s completely unrealistic for them to go to this length as it would cost WAY WAY too much funding. The only reliable and affordable method they have presently to stop drug traffickers in the mail are by teaching mail sorters to spot suspicious packages from idiotic criminals. <br /><br />Dogs are NOT masterful. Nearly every dollar in the US has cocaine residue on it. Meaning so do a lot of peoples hands, and so do a lot of peoples packages. They can&#039;t just sniff each and every package, as it goes down the line, not only is the dog not a supercomputer speed worker, but the dog would go off on 90% of the packages in the system. The way they use a dog to pinpoint drug packages is in comparison to other legit packages, trying to pinpoint the one with the strongest odor. <br /><br /><br />Your idea would be an effective solution to the drugs in mail problem, only if the united states put forth massive amounts of employees, trained dogs, trained handlers, at every hub in the country. It takes a lot time to effectively train a drug dog. This being said, this task would require way too much effort and way too much funding and would massively slow down the mailing system. A slowed down mailing system would adversely effect the economy and this is something we can&#039;t afford now. <br /><br />It&#039;s incredibly unlikely they would ever implement something like this. It&#039;s a simple solution. But remember there are a lot of simple solutions the government could do, but they all have cost.... money, time, effort, manpower, invasion of privacy, etc. If the government jumped on every solution they had to every problem and ignored all of those above concerns, the US would be the worst country on the planet, highly regulated, with very little freedom.

				The truth likely lies between these two points of view on Security. On one hand I agree with Tommyhawk that LEO is likely to be ultimately compromised by A: the Numbers and B: their own Politics, but I also agree with kmfkewm in thinking that governments have also been known to take extreme measures without relationship to economy. Putting tracking dots on practically every single sheet of printed A4 is seriously, seriously over the top, yet it has already been done, and as far back as 2001 too. Because the Silk Road appears like such an anomaly, it will be the focus of much political capital and subject to disproportionate attack vectors that would probably impinge more on the freedoms of civilians than ourselves. <br /><br />We are effectively waiting for LEO to make the next move, fairly soon I would imagine our conjectures will become realized. It would not surprise me if secret Congress hearings are being held last year or this year. Wiser heads have probably told the senator to shut the fuck up, since more media attention will make the Silk Road mushroom in size (haha! Mushroom... I&#039;m so funny). Surprisingly, I don&#039;t think the same has occurred in the UK since it is clear that a D notice has not yet been issued on the Silk Road if the BBC can explicitly mention it in their Five Live interviews. Possibly the British are either playing a different game, they are taking a lazare faire approach (as a devil&#039;s advocate I would argue this is the best policy for a nation state, i.e. containment rather than control, there is actually a place where LEO and the Silk Road&#039;s objectives meet in some ways e.g. the reduction of violence on the streets since less enforcers are required).

				If it were not for trying to outsource it multiple times in the first place, it would probably be done by now and it would also have cost a lot less money. The people who have offered to do it for pay so far all entirely lack the skill required. Best bet to do it right is to do it myself imo, and stop wasting money on people who don&#039;t know how to do what is requested.

He said that an entry level laptop computer could return the list of addresses that fit this pattern in less than a day, a powerful network cluster could return results like this without even justification of a coffee break. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not to mention, they couldn&#039;t be completely accurate. They can&#039;t just go off of, who recieves packages from drug states.... Every state in the country more than likely recieves thousands of packages from every other state in the country every day. There is so much mail in the system. They can&#039;t profile just on state-state.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sure but I am also certain that there are fingerprints that stick out as worthy of further investigation. Assholeoutlaw pointed out one I had not thought of, profiling for addresses that only started getting a lot of mail / international packs after SR launched. There are probably a lot of interesting patterns that can be searched for, and to search a total of 200 billion entries for such patterns would require a trivial amount of computing power. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And as far as profiling packages on how they look.... that&#039;s pretty hard for a vendor who knows what they&#039;re doing. Anyone vendor who knows what they&#039;re doing will package it like the millions of other legit mail parcels in the mail system.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well they do profile mail based on how it looks all the time,but yeah smart vendors use good packaging that doesn&#039;t stick out. This thread is more about traffic analysis though, it is interested in patterns in routing data nothing else. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As far as tracking this stuff based on when the feedback was left, there are way too many probability and chance of false results coming up. They may narrow the results to a few thousand or few hundred packages... but understand this. There are so many packages in the mail system. They do not have the time, resources, or man power, or will for that matter, to &#039;redflag&#039; all of these possible suspects, because that would mean checkings hundreds or possibly thousands of packages all over the country.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The point I made in the original post is that all of this address routing information is potentially being stored already. In some countries *every single routing address: return address, to address, date sent* is recorded by the machine that sorts the mail. It is entirely possible for this to happen in USA as well and probably already is happening since the technology to do it is integrated into a lot of mail sorting technology and it isn&#039;t illegal for the feds to access such databases of routing information. USPS sends 200 billion packages a year about, searching a database of 200 billion entries for patterns is not computationally expensive. There is no man power involved, it is all computing power. <br /><br />Also you are not understanding how an intersection attack works. At any given time there are probably tens or hundreds of thousands of packages in route from location X. At any given time there are probably tens or hundreds of thousands of packages in route from location Z. But during those two time frames, there is probably not much cross contamination. If you know someone has a pack from location X coming to them in a certain time frame, and know this same person then has a pack from location Y coming to them in a different time frame, you can query the database for everyone who had packs from location X in this time frame and from location Z in this time frame. Then you intersect the crowds and remove addresses that are not in both of them. The resulting crowd is not likely going to be very large, and every single additional query that you add is going to likely reduce it by a lot. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not to mention, checking a single package isn&#039;t the quickest thing. For a dog to pinpoint a package, it can take up to a minute. They don&#039;t have the time to have a dog check and recheck multiple packages over and over again that they suspect. This would put a MAJOR slow down in the mail system, and would cost way way to much to hire the additional man power to do it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are not understanding the attack. The attack identifies a pseudonyms real identity, at which point that persons mail can be more closely screened. The attack is not &quot;Okay we know this person ordered a package from roughly X location, let&#039;s scan all packs from X location looking for drugs!&quot;. It is &quot;We know this pseudonym ordered from X location in this time frame and Y location in this time frame, according to mail logs only this shipping address falls into this pattern, so this pseudonym is tied to this shipping address&quot;. That is how the intersection attack works anyway, the fingerprinting attack works more like &quot;This address gets a lot of packages from netherlands and california, lets automatically flag it&quot;. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only thing they can reliably go off of, is hoping stupid criminals package their drugs in stupid ways so they can profile the exterior.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think traffic analysis will be pretty effective personally. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You must realize the steps required, the time required, the man power, and cost required, to effectively utilize a system as you describe. Even if they do use this algorithm, to pin point people POSSIBLY recieving drugs, based on the states they recieve from(still an incredibly inaccurate way to track it as packages are recieved everywhere from everywhere everyday)... they would need 10-100 dogs, and trained handlers for those dogs are each mail hub in the country, since it takes so long for a dog to pinpoint a drug package from a legit one.. this is because they have to lay multiple legit packages next to suspect ones and allow the dogs to sniff it over and over again before they can get a warrant.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well we should assume the USA already is storing all routing information of all mail that passes through it, since it is technically possible to do with mail sorting equipment that is already on the market and since other countries are known to be doing this. We can also assume that such an algorithm exists, I mean it is really just a basic intersection attack it exists to be targeted at E-mail and other internet communications, &quot;porting&quot; that to work against real mail would be trivial. Also they would be identifying the shipping address that is likely tied to drug trafficking, so they could just have the dog smell packages when they make it to the post office that delivers it to the target. That would make it pretty simple. You also need to keep in mind that if they do this they will probably start intercepting a lot more packs than if they just have drug dogs randomly smell mail. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s completely unrealistic for them to go to this length as it would cost WAY WAY too much funding. The only reliable and affordable method they have presently to stop drug traffickers in the mail are by teaching mail sorters to spot suspicious packages from idiotic criminals. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They apparently already have most of what is required to be doing this. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your idea would be an effective solution to the drugs in mail problem, only if the united states put forth massive amounts of employees, trained dogs, trained handlers, at every hub in the country. It takes a lot time to effectively train a drug dog. This being said, this task would require way too much effort and way too much funding and would massively slow down the mailing system. A slowed down mailing system would adversely effect the economy and this is something we can&#039;t afford now. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You have kind of lost me at this point but it seems you entirely misunderstood how this attack works :(. The information needed to perform these attacks is ALREADY probably being recorded and stored in USA, it is in use in other countries. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s incredibly unlikely they would ever implement something like this. It&#039;s a simple solution. But remember there are a lot of simple solutions the government could do, but they all have cost.... money, time, effort, manpower, invasion of privacy, etc. If the government jumped on every solution they had to every problem and ignored all of those above concerns, the US would be the worst country on the planet, highly regulated, with very little freedom.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The USA is a shitty highly regulated country with very little freedom....we are using the same technology that Chinese and Iranian dissidents use, so that we can avoid being thrown into re-education camps and prisons....sorry if you were brainwashed into thinking you are free.&nbsp; You are free to do what the state tells you you can do. The only reason average Americans think that people in China are not free is because the Chinese State says that Chinese citizens can&#039;t do things that the American State doesn&#039;t say American Citizens can&#039;t do.

				This research seems to confirm my growing belief that the most effective way to participate in this sort of system is if you&#039;re living a nomadic lifestyle. This would especially be true of vendors. Consider if you had a trusted partner, bulk access to drugs, an RV, a small plane, and no geographically concentrated obligations. Never stay in a single location you&#039;re operating from for more than a couple weeks. Live in the RV and rent an office for a couple weeks in whatever new city you&#039;re in to do order prep. Fly the drugs from place to place to minimize the risk of random traffic stops (general aviation is surprisingly unregulated). Set up shop, use random wifi on a disposable device, ship heaps of orders, destroy the wifi device and then bounce. Take a couple week vaca before the next round :) .

				Thought of a way to do an attack with out pseudonym data, just with reviews, mail routing information, and general knowledge of where the vendor ships from (let&#039;s assume that the vendor probably ships from within a 240 mile radius). This one might actually be infeasible though :P. <br /><br />If the attacker assumes that the customer leaves a review within a week of when they get an order from a vendor who ships from a known general location (~240 mile radius), they can do this:<br /><br />Who all was sent and received a package sent from within this ~240 mile radius within a week prior to when a review was left? Add all of these addresses to a &quot;potential suspect - low certainty&quot; crowd. Do this for every single review that is left. Take all resulting &quot;potential suspect - low certainty&quot; crowds, and look for addresses that appear multiple times. The more times an address appears in a &quot;potential suspect - low certainty&quot; crowd, the more likely that person is getting drugs from SR. <br /><br />Without having access to the database of mail routing information it is impossible to see how much noise there would actually be. If a vendor is shipping from the middle of fucking no where there probably isn&#039;t that much outgoing mail though (meaning that the potential suspect crowd related to that order could be pretty low number). Not sure how many non drug users would appear in a significant number of potential suspect crowds though...probably a lot though (a lot of people probably get mail from New York City in the week prior to you leaving a review on the vendor who just sent you a pack from NYC). I guess it would probably actually be better to assign a &quot;suspect potential&quot; score based on the total crowd size. For example, if you are one out of five thousand people who got a package from the middle of fucking no where in a week prior to leaving your review, you could get 10 potential suspect points for that, where as if you are one of the five million people who got a package from New York City in the one week time span prior to you leaving a review, you only get .05 suspect points.<br /><br />Over time, shipping addresses with higher amount of suspect points would be more likely to be tied to people leaving reviews on SR.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this attack variant is largely mental masturbation on my part, I am not quite sure it is infeasible but it is certainly a lot less likely to be useful than the other mentioned attacks ;). <br /><br /><br />Of course if the attacker can also get a list of all Tor client IP addresses (by monitoring directory authority servers....easy if you do not have a bridge) and corresponding customer registration addresses (from ISPs)....they could intersect the list of &quot;potential suspect&quot; shipping addresses with the list of Tor user addresses and probably deanonymize everyone who leaves a single review. (Alice is the only Tor user in this crowd of 10 million shipping addresses that potentially got an order from this vendor).<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope only intelligence agencies have access to both databases. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if LE have access to both, but I am not sure if they can translate every Tor client IP address into a customer address in a dragnet fashion (of course they can ask an ISP for the customer address of X tor IP address...but if they can ask for all Tor client IP addresses corresponding customer registration address and keep a big database, is another question).

				kmfkewm, your devil&#039;s advocate attack seems to target buyers more than sellers.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it just be easier to attack by the barcode?<br /><br />Each package of size &gt; envelope has a barcode. Barcodes are intended to be scanned by the millions. So, if you adopt a unique barcode per box of packages, then you have a lead on the majority of sellers.<br /><br />All you need to do is:<br /><br />Ensure the major suppliers of packaging pass on their barcode IDs to you. e.g. for each box, and then acquire packages from all the vendors on the Silk Road. Then you can make more specific requests of the suppliers for the shop where the box was purchased or the IP address of the buyer.&nbsp; Sooner or later, you&#039;ll have the financial details of each seller unless they used prepaid cards/cash for the boxes, and even then you have their geographical location + potential CCTV stills or an IP addresss if they bought them online.<br /><br />I mean, I don&#039;t think this is that likely,&nbsp; but it&#039;s possible.<br /><br />Also; Re the RV situation, I&#039;d say wandering about in a densely populated city is far safer on many levels.<br />
