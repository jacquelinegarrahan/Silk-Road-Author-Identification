You may piss off a vendor who is posting under their secondary, non-vendor forum account. If you were to later attempt to buy something from that vendor without realizing that you had pissed him off under a different name, then you may have issues.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah if you don&#039;t get along well with someone on the forum like you say, that could be a problem. I&#039;m also thinking that if you say something on the forum that could in any way be linked to you as a person that could help authorities. I don&#039;t mean your address but maybe things that could help them identify you otherwise. Like if you say you live in the countryside or you say you have long hair or whatever. If you have a different username on the forum you might not have to be as paranoid and cautious.

				I file this under &quot;who the hell cares?&quot;<br /><br />On your PGP key, should you use your tormail address, or a throwaway address, or no address at all?<br /><br />On your BTC address, should you use the same one for two transactions, or three, or five before you switch it?<br /><br />If you browse the forum on your android device, is it okay to burn the sim card, or is flushing it down the toilet okay?<br /><br />The tin-foil hat behavior must have limits.&nbsp; It must.&nbsp; Please tell me, someone, that it has limits.

				I would definitely advise having different names unless you are vending. No reason not to take every possible precaution
