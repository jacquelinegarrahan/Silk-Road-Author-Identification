It usually always takes an hour minimum for coins to show in my wallet, for example.

				Moneygram is the same as Western Union? Do you mean they are similar or competing services?<br /><br />You can&#039;t choose to deposit into Ziggap via Western Union and then fill out a Moneygram deposit slip, can you? I am wondering how people are able to do Moneygram deposits with Ziggap.
