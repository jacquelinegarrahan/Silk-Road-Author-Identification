				A Tails developer responds in the next message on the link you posted.<br /><br />Pretty much, if someone roots your copy of Tails, they can disable the firewall anyway, by either shutting down iptables or flushing the rules.<br /><br />Even worse, they can copy all your super secret files like your PGP private keys.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen the script, but I accept the explanation that it makes certain firewall operations easier for someone who wants muck around with Tails as root. However, an adversary with root privileges can fuck you way harder than that script can.<br />

				I can&#039;t believe they even posted that nonsense on Cryptome. Urgent!!! Someone who roots you can disable your firewall!!! Someone who roots you can force Tor to use their entry guard and get your IP address that way. Tails really isn&#039;t designed to strongly protect you from hackers getting your real IP address if they hack you, especially not if they root you. Pretty much the only way to protect your IP address from someone who roots you, is to have Tor running on a separate machine (or the host, if you are using a virtual machine) and forcing all of your traffic through that machines Tor (or Tor on the host), and only having an internal IP address assigned to the non-Tor machine.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Dafuq?? That&#039;s like saying an admin account disabling the Windows firewall from control panel is an exploit. At first I thought it was a local privilege escalation thing, which is kind of moot anyway unless you&#039;re a business or need multiple user accounts for some reason.

				It appears the general concensus is that you are safe. If you want to be on the more cautious side you could delete that file (in the OP) each time you start Tails.<br />While it is true you need root access to run that file the real question is why have it there at all. Do the Tails developers use it so frequently that it necessitates being included in the release? Maybe so, but it seems like a tool that could also be exploited.
