				Ok, So I met up with a local bitcoin vendor, and bought a few coins.&nbsp; They were transfered from his wallet to my Blockchain wallet without incident. He went his way, I set the coins to transfer from my blockchain to my SR wallet.&nbsp; 1HR later and we are at 6 Confirmations for the transfer INTO my Blockchain, and ZERO CONFIRMATIONS(!?!?!?!) for the transfer into my SR wallet.&nbsp; I&#039;m freaking out bc the balance on both my Blockchain and SR are under 50 cents, and still no confirmations on the SR transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;WTF is going on?&nbsp; Usually I set them to transfer as soon as I get the text and they show up in my blockchain.&nbsp; The Confirmation Count for BlockChain to SR has always kept on pace with the confirmations for Vendor to my BlockChain.&nbsp; I&#039;m worried.&nbsp; Does anyone know what is happening?&nbsp; I dont know a lot about BTC or how it works, but I do know that this is NOT what has happened on the 17+ other transactions I&#039;ve done this way.&nbsp; Who do I talk to about this?&nbsp; Any help is GREATLY appreciated.

				OK, so as soon as I posted this topic, I look and the first transaction is at 7confirmations, and I finally got the 1st confirm on the SR transfer.&nbsp; Why so slow tonight?&nbsp; Is this going to be the way it goes all night? 1 confirmation/1 hr instead of 10min?

				Did you pay a transaction fee? If you don&#039;t, the confirmations will be slowed down, because miners will give the transaction a low priority.
