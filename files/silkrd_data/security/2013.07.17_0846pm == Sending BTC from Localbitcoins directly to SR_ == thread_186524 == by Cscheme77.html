				&nbsp; If you&#039;re paying the contact in cash, either face to face or bank over the counter, then you could send it straight to SR I suppose :-\ Definitely not if you&#039;re paying by online transfer or anything linking back to you.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Seriously, though, why take the risk of being connected to bitcoins going to Silkroad. Cops find drugs in your mail you can deny any knowledge. They find evidence you&#039;ve used Tor recently, even evidence of visiting SR, you can say you were curious about all the media fuss. They find drugs, tor/SR and can connect you with bitcoins being sent to an SR wallet it&#039;s looking like a more solid case.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Transactions are recorded in the blockchain forever, tor wallets are easily identified as such. Just use and dispose of new online wallets every time. The fees are miniscule; 0.0005 of the total amount as standard. If you were transferring $40000 worth of btc you&#039;d pay a $20 fee... Small price for completely closing down that avenue of investigation by law enforcement.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Best wishes, AB.

In case the btc you&#039;re buying is part of a leo operation, or whatever, in which they will monitor and track btc transactions from the wallet they sent the btc to, you instead have it sent to your bitcoin fog wallet, follow their directions, and you will be able to withdraw those coins to another wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp; Recommend anonymous online throwaway wallet different every time, then onto your SR wallet. Or you could withdraw it directly to SR. Either way bitcoin fog would need to be compromised for your transactions to be trackable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Clearnet link *** http://www.bitcoinfog.com/ *** They, of course, have a hidden service, but I can&#039;t remember the url off top of head. Check this site out for tutorial, AB.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, SR tumbles, but if you buy btc off leo who transfer the btc to a wallet address you give them, which you then use to transfer coin to SR, or worse you just give leo your sr wallet address, the SR tumbling service won&#039;t help, AB.
