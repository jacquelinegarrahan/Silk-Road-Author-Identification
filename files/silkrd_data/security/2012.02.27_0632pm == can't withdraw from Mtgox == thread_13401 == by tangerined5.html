				In the past I&#039;ve sent Bitcoins directly from Mtgox to Silk Road, but today when I tried to do that, I found that the &quot;withdraw&quot; option on Mtgox&#039;s website has disappeared. There now appears to be no way to send my Bitcoins from Mtgox over here. Has anyone else encountered this or know what&#039;s up?<br /><br />And if this won&#039;t work any more, what&#039;s the best way to get my Bitcoins from Mtgox into my SR account?

				Alright. <br /><br />Im as new as a newbie can be. Ive read a few ppl saying Mtgox is not to good for getting bitcoins. Intersango was my best bet with cash deposits at loyds but that isnt working anymore, for now anyway. <br /><br />Whats the quickest and safest way to get bit coins into my wallet. I cant be bothered to wait for days for transfers and stuff. Im looking through stuff now, if I read anything good I&#039;l post it.

I say evening, but since Mt Gox are in Japan (GMT +9), it&#039;s normally around 3 in the morning (midday Japanese time)<br />Once the cash is in my Mt Gox account, buying the BTC is instantaneous, and the transfer from Mt Gox to Silk Road takes about 1 to 2 hours.

				BTW the MtGox buggers are witholding my money, telling me one reply a day whether I have set my settings correctly, in fact I already set it correctly even before they ask me &#039;whether it is set correctly&#039;. It&#039;s like more than 4 days. Those mofo want me to wait another 24hrs to read my reply. <br /><br />Grrrgh!<br /><br />Anyone else using wire transfer as well and encounter this shit? As in they won&#039;t sent you MtGox $ until you contact them?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				That&#039;s it, this is the last time I would use MtGox, think crypto is much better.<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe MtGox attempt to steal money from customers!

				MtGox is nothing but trouble.&nbsp; They&#039;re working hand-in-hand with the DEA.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t readily identify you then they&#039;re liable to freeze your account until you provide government-issued ID.&nbsp; <br /><br />Leech -- by wallet we mean https://www.instawallet.org/&nbsp; You can get a Bitcoin deposit address &amp; a link, or URL,&nbsp; that points to the wallet.&nbsp; You can then use this wallet as a step to getting Bitcoins to SR.&nbsp; Send your coins from wherever you bought them to the wallet, &amp; then from the wallet to perhaps another wallet, &amp; then on to SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />** Just be sure to bookmark the Instawallet URL.&nbsp; You must have that URL to get back to the same wallet.&nbsp; It&#039;s not enough to just have the Bitcoin address for receiving payments.&nbsp; **

				Me old.<br />Intersango was my best bet with cash deposits at loyds but that isnt working anymore, for now anyway.<br /><br />ukbenjy.<br />Intersango&#039;s website doesn&#039;t mention cash deposits being down, and I paid in money on Friday 24th and had it in my account Sat 25th. <br /><br />Me new.<br />Thanx ukbenjy. Ive heard and read a few grumblings about mtgox being slow and different things, it can already take a while from deciding to buy, ordering and receiving (for obvious reasons) so I dont think I&#039;l end up using them. The thing with intersango was the other week they had some issue with the bank they used to receive cash payments (Loyds). They said they were having to change banks so put all their orders on hold and ppl wernt getting their money come through in the same time. I dont know if they have a new bank or managed to sort it out with Loyds but there seemed to be some problem. I think ppl got the money eventually, that was last week, dont know whats happening now.<br />
