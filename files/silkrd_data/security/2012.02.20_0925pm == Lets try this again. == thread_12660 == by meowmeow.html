				Also, just FYI, I originally posted this in the Security section with the title, &quot;Site compromised?&nbsp; Please read.&quot;&nbsp; When I reloaded, it was there.&nbsp; When I reloaded again, it had been removed.&nbsp; At that point I reposted it here with the current title.&nbsp; That&#039;s why the title of this thread is, &quot;Lets try this again.&quot;<br /><br />Not sure what to make of all of it.

				I don&#039;t see why any attacker would make the captcha be the name of your router. What would they gain by doing that? Sounds like paranoia.

				I just tried to post a reply just now and had been kicked.&nbsp; Something isn&#039;t right here.<br /><br />As far as my router being unique, yeah.. it&#039;s unique.&nbsp; I never leave things as &quot;Linksys&quot; or whatever.&nbsp; Anyway, a random code gen spitting out &quot;Linksys&quot; is just as scary.

				Is your router called as8s73 or something like apple123? <br /><br />Though to be honest I swear the pool of words in the &#039;captcha&#039; system are pre-chosen to freak people out :p

				The second one.. a word followed by a number.&nbsp; Not only did it get the word right, but also the 3 digit number I chose to follow it.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t aware there was a word pool.&nbsp; I guess that would make the odds less than 1 in 2 trillion, but still very unlikely.

				Yeah the SR captcha is formatted like a license plate lol. <br /><br />First few characters are letters--or random words to be precise--and the 2nd set are numbers.
