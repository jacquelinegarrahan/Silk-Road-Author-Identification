				So I was trying to get some questions answered by a vendor called &quot;La Fuente&quot; about whether or not I could use a p.o. box with his service. He responded with a simple, &quot;send me your pgp key, thanks.&quot; I didn&#039;t really think anything of it, so I gave him my personal key, along with my encrypted shipping address. Now looking back on things, the whole thing seems kind of sketchy. Why would he want my pgp key before I even ordered anything from him? Could this be some sort of trap to attempt to incriminate me as soon as I order? I&#039;m worried.

				exchanging PGP information is common practice, he needs it in order to send you any encrypted messages. maybe he didn&#039;t want to communicate in plaintext? whatever it is, your situation has nothing to do with TOR or SR being compromised, you have nothing to worry about.

				If the vendor simply asked for your PGP Key, no big deal. Another person needs your PGP Key in order to send you an encrypted message. This is how you would be able to have an encrypted conversation.<br /><br />No why on earth would you have sent the vendor your shipping address before you placed an order and if the vendor didn&#039;t ask for it? That seems like a mistake.

				As others have said, your public PGP key is not a secret, hence the name. It is needed so that people can send you encrypted messages which only you can decrypt, using your secret, private key.<br /><br />No offense intended here, but you should know these things. Don&#039;t be a noob - educate yourself before diving head first into things which can get you in trouble.

				Bunch of things, especially as a new buyer, you can do to be safe. You are already doing more than many people that shop on the road. Using encryption and the forums; check!<br /><br />Stick with established venders that have a great rating. Find someone that will work with a new person and not require FE. If you can&#039;t then&nbsp; buy a very small amount to start with. Venders with a &gt;99% rating are not going to get a bit review to rob you of 5 bitcoins. Practice safe TOR web use and money transfer methods.

				Yes, start with small orders. There&#039;s a psychological benefit to that too. A lot of new buyers freak out about getting busted on their first few orders. It takes time and successful deliveries to build confidence that the system works, remarkably well actually. Remember, you know you have a package of contraband coming, but the postal employees don&#039;t. All they see is an ocean of packages. Small orders are less likely to be detected and less likely to be followed up with controlled deliveries or letters.

Without question PGP is more secure. This is because you and you alone generate/store a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages. You don&#039;t have to transfer your private key over data lines, and you never have to reveal it to another party (unless compelled by force). Your public key, also generated and distributed by you, allows another person to encrypt messages to you but not decrypt them. Simple and elegent - you are in charge of your secret code. <br /><br />TorChat, on the other hand, generates their own key pairs (I assume, I&#039;m not a programmer) much like hushmail and privnote. You do not retain a private key and thus cannot know with certainty whether it has been or is compromised. More than this, you don&#039;t know for certain who developed it, and for what true purpose.. Yes yes, I realize the website states that it was torproject, however these are but words on a page which could be published with little or no effort by anyone.. Without first hand knowlege, and/or sophisticated knowledge of the program, I cannot prove that TorChat is nothing more that a means to gather unencrypted intelligence from persons using the deep web. As you can see, it is TorChat which is the false security. The same goes for PrivNote, and I&#039;m sure everyone is aware that Hushmail handed over emails that were believed to be sent by some other market. It was easy - they had the key pair - the agencies need but ask. <br /><br />You mentioned using a boot drive (which is a good idea) for Tor, etc.. But I&#039;m not following. So TorChat is just as safe or better than PGP because it wipes all the traces and you can use a bootable drive? Use a bootable linux. There&#039;s a bunch of them and linux stuff is free. It also has PGP preinstalled. Don&#039;t buy one, ever - I would strongly suggest building your own. I would also suggest a second drive for your encryption tools and conviguered without web access. This precaution is so internal survailence apps - like keyloggers, etc. - can&#039;t relay info through an open line. <br /><br />There&#039;s other stuff (removing your hard drive before booting to your virtual system, for instance) but the main point stands. PGP is safe because you generated and retain the private key. But it is only secure if you are secure. Other programs like TorChat...whose to say. Not a risk I&#039;d take if it was a serious matter. <br /><br />Saludos,<br /><br />LF&nbsp;

As you can see, it is TorChat which is the false security. The same goes for PrivNote, and I&#039;m sure everyone is aware that Hushmail handed over emails that were believed to be sent by some other market. It was easy - they had the key pair - the agencies need but ask. <br /><br />You mentioned using a boot drive (which is a good idea) for Tor, etc.. But I&#039;m not following. So TorChat is just as safe or better than PGP because it wipes all the traces and you can use a bootable drive? Use a bootable linux. There&#039;s a bunch of them and linux stuff is free. It also has PGP preinstalled. Don&#039;t buy one, ever - I would strongly suggest building your own. I would also suggest a second drive for your encryption tools and conviguered without web access. This precaution is so internal survailence apps - like keyloggers, etc. - can&#039;t relay info through an open line. <br /><br />There&#039;s other stuff (removing your hard drive before booting to your virtual system, for instance) but the main point stands. PGP is safe because you generated and retain the private key. But it is only secure if you are secure. Other programs like TorChat...whose to say. Not a risk I&#039;d take if it was a serious matter. <br /><br />Saludos,<br /><br />LF&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />you need to read more about tor chat first this it has been around for 4 years been tested by anyone who is anyone in that field pasted with flying colors with torchat you CAN NOT BE FORCED TO RELEASE YOUR KEY FOR THERE IS NO KEY

				Everyone who uses Torchat runs as a hidden service. Essentially it is like Alice is a hidden service and Bob is a hidden service. When Alice communicates with Bob she sends her messages to his .onion address, and when Bob sends messages to Alice he sends them to her .onion address. This sort of hides the encryption being used from the user, because unlike GPG where you need to manage your keys and ciphertexts and such, you are just piggy backing on the encryption already provided by Tor. Torchat is sort of neat in that by having everyone run as a hidden service, there is no fixed middle point server that your communications go through (as compared to IRC for example). <br /><br />I have two primary issues with Torchat. The first issue I have with it is that I saw one of the Tor developers comment that the code is buggy. I have not audited the code myself so have no comment, but I am inclined to believe them. Torchat is not part of the Tor project. My biggest issue with Torchat is that everyone runs as a hidden service. Hidden services do not have as strong of anonymity as normal clients do. Everyone running as a hidden service is a Bad Idea, and this design choice is enough to make me suggest strongly against using Torchat.<br /><br />Additionally, it is not technically correct to say that Torchat has no key. It is just that the keys are managed by Tor, since Torchat provides encryption by piggy backing on Tor as I already mentioned. The real difference you guys are talking about is not so much between GPG and Torchat but rather between the general way that RSA is used and the general way that ECDH is used. <br /><br />The use model for RSA is generally that Alice and Bob each have a long term public/private keypair. When Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message, she encrypts her plaintext with a symmetric algorithm, something like AES-256. The randomly generated key used to symmetrically encrypt the message to Bob is then asymmetrically encrypted with Bobs public key. Upon receiving the ciphertext, Bob enters his password to decrypt his symmetrically encrypted private key. He then uses his private key to decrypt the encrypted session key, and then uses the decrypted session key to decrypt the symmetrically encrypted ciphertext back into the plaintext.&nbsp; <br /><br />(EC)DH is generally used a bit differently. It is a secret sharing algorithm. Imagine Alice and Bob both have long term ECDSA keypairs. These are used for signing messages. Alice and Bob exchange public ECDSA keypairs so they can verify plaintexts from each other in the future. When Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message, she generates an ephemeral ECDH keypair and sends the public key to Bob. Now Bob generates an ephemeral public keypair and sends his public key to Alice. Alice uses her ephemeral private key and Bobs public key to derive a shared secret, at which point she can securely overwrite her private and even public ephemeral keys. Now she uses her ECDSA private key to sign her plaintext. She then uses the shared secret to symmetrically encrypt the signed plaintext and then she sends it to Bob. Bob uses his ephemeral private key and Alice&#039;s ephemeral public key to derive a shared secret as well, and due to the properties of (EC)DH his secret will be the same as Alice&#039;s (it is a SHARED secret after all). Now Bob uses this secret to symmetrically decrypt the ciphertext, and then uses Alice&#039;s public ECDSA key to verify that Alice actually sent the message. He can then securely erase his public and private ephemeral ECDH key. New ephemeral ECDH keys are generated on a message by message basis. This is a cryptosystem that uses ECDH to achieve forward secrecy, which is a pretty common way of using ECDH, although the same thing can also be done with RSA and ECDH can also be used with long term non-ephemeral keypairs. <br /><br />So it isn&#039;t that there is no key, it is just that the key is deleted as soon as you are done with it. It isn&#039;t even really a fundamental difference between RSA and DH , it is just the way the systems that use these ciphers are generally constructed. OTR is one example of a system that uses DH in such a way. Tor is another.

				The primary thing to note is that with long term keys (the way RSA is generally used, ie: with GPG the way it is usually used) if Alice has her private key compromised, all intercepted ciphertexts ever sent to her that were encrypted with that private keys corresponding public key can be decrypted. The way that (DH / ECDH) is usually used (ie: Tor, OTR), intercepted ciphertexts become impossible to decrypt with traditional (non-quantum) computing power as soon as the private keys are erased, which happens every time a new message is sent.

PGP has no such requirement, being originally designed to deal with email, which by definition is stored and/or forwarded. If one desires maximum anonymity, one can resort to nymservers and anonymous remailers, e.g. Mixmaster. <br /><br />Forward secrecy would be a great addition to PGP,&nbsp; although I&#039;m given to understand that it is non-trivial to implement. <br /><br />In the meantime, one can periodically delete/replace the private halves of one&#039;s PGP encryption sub-keys, which will have the same effect, except that there will be a longer period of time and more traffic potentially exposed to key compromise during that period. If the replacement period is relatively short, e.g. 10 days or so, any traffic compromise would be minimal. Naturally, this would work best when two parties are communicating, as they can pass updated keys to each other. <br /><br />It would still be workable even for a vendor; a vendor could place an updated key on his page, and instruct his client to update the key PRIOR to sending him any messages. <br />(Whether buyers would possess the necessary discipline to follow these instructions is another matter, however.) <br /><br />NC<br /><br /><br />

				I never argued in favor of Torchat I am actually quite against it :P.

The same exact thing can be done with RSA, you just exchange a brand new keypair with every person you communicate with, and you delete it after each message, and with each message you send a new public key for the next message to be encrypted to.

Of course an end user actually juggling so many keys is pretty much impossible, systems like this need to be built right into the software like with OTR. Right now there is a system being developed that is similar to Mixminion but more secure from long term intersection attacks, fully internal without any reliance on E-mail addresses, with encryption like OTR built into it and supporting group communications.

				Generating random session keys for each message isn&#039;t the problem, the problem is how to transfer them between Alice and Bob without an attacker in the middle being able to determine them, and without an attacker in the middle being able to stockpile ciphertexts that they can later demand the key for. Managing it yourself with something like GPG is pretty much out of the question due to the fact that it wasn&#039;t really designed for that sort of communication, you would need some specialized software program.

With OTR, a new ephemeral public key is generated for each message and after Alice sends the message (and for Bob after he decrypts it) the ephemeral keys are securely overwritten. This means that an attacker who stockpiles a thousand ciphertexts will never be able to get the keys to decrypt them because the keys are destroyed immediately after they are used. Furthermore, unless Alice or Bob are malicious and running malicious clients, even they will never see the ephemeral public keys used or know the session keys, because OTR handles all of that for you.
