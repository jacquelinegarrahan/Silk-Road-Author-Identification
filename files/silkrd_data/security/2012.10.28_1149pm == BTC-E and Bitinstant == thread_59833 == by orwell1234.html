				I don&#039;t know what happened with bitinstant and why they removed the ability to cash deposit into a Bitcoin account but It is absolutely fucking bull shit FUCK them for that. That being said now that everyone is frantically trying to find another safe secure way to get coins to the road I have my own questions. I&#039;m leaning towards using BTC-E because you can access it through tor and still maintain most of your anonymity. I&#039;m wondering is it safe to go through bitinstant to BTC-E then to SR bit coin wallet?

I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll run into any issues for regular cash deposits, just don&#039;t try logging in with TOR or public proxies.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had one experience with them, which was on Friday, and everything went fine. I did have to wait 24 hours before withdrawing the btc because I changed my password, but that&#039;s my own fault.

				UPDATE!!!!<br /><br />I went with BTC-E for the simple fact you can log in through TOR. I&#039;ve made the bitinstant payment and received the Email confirming but I&#039;ve yet to receive anything on BTC-E &#039;s end. Usually with Bitinstant with a bitcoin address it was almost instant. Its been apx 2 hrs and I haven&#039;t recieved anything in my BTC-E account. Crossing my fingers and hoping I&#039;m not fucked will update when things change.

				I&#039;ve also been affected by the BitInstant developments. I changed my MO to from BitInstant to wallet to BitInstant to Mtgox and it was ridiculously quick. The money was in my account before I got home from depositing the money via MoneyGram a 5 min walk away from my apartment. This was Friday night.

I started a transaction with BitInstant (cash deposit at local store --&gt; BTC-E account --&gt; wallet tumbling --&gt; SR) last night around midnight and completed it this morning on the way to work, and the cash was in my BTC-E account and ready to exchange for BTC in less than twenty minutes. Perhaps it really was an error that had to do with the hurricane or whatnot. Keep contacting them.

				BTC-E does work but I think it&#039;s on the BitInstant side, not the BTC-E side. I had this same issue and sent several emails to bitinstant including Charlie@bitinstant.com. I called there phone and btw only use the email support@bitinstant.<br /><br />To get things resolved quicker, I saw Charlie was pretty active on the BTCtalk forum so I made an account and wrote a ranty message about how fucked up it all was. He sent me a PM and an email within three minutes. Within 10 minutes all of my funds were in my account. Try that and it should work. <br /><br />Nothing a little public scolding shouldn&#039;t sort out.

				I&#039;ve never used BTC-E but i have used Bitinstant with MtGox and was always really happy. Then they removed the bank deposit option which really sucks because it was really convenient. I tried using the local deposit option (7-11, walmart, etc. with MoneyGram) but found that the ZipZap fee of $4 and the MoneyGram fee of $5 plus fees from getting my coin tumbled around was not worth it for the amount of coin I needed. I also kept getting asked for ID everywhere I went so decided to ditch that option. So i found localbitcoins.com and found a bitcoin seller near me. We met up at a coffee shop, traded cash for coin and that was that! Quick and painless. Heres a statement released by Bitinstant about their issues from this past weekend http://goo.gl/mXSqt

				Egg on face. It was on bitisntant side. Here is a tip for dealing with this site and why I made my mistakes. Its russian so use google translate to send the message translated in to Russian and vice versa to understand them. It took 4 days to see funds but at least I finally got them so I wanted to clear this up.

				I used bitinstant to deposit to btc-e.&nbsp; The funds were in my btc-e account when I got home.&nbsp; The funds go in as dollars.&nbsp; I traded the dollars for bitcoins.&nbsp; The going rate on bitcoins was cheaper than mt gox.&nbsp; The commission at btc-e is only 0.2% and then there is a small 0.01 bitcoin fee to withdraw the money out of btc-e and into my wallet.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty happy with the process.&nbsp; The only thing I don&#039;t like is paying bitinstant the ridiculous 4% fee.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m going to try using bitfloor for a deposit at 0.6% instead of paying bitinstant 3.99%+$3.95.

				I&#039;m fairly satisfied that BTC-E is legit, but no one has yet answered if the site can be used while running TOR. <br /><br />I can browse the Mt.Gox site while I&#039;m running TOR, but I don&#039;t want to log-in that way for obvious reasons. <br /><br />I have browsed BTC-E while running TOR as well, but I haven&#039;t yet tried to log-in or open an account there yet. I was hoping to get an answer from someone who has used it successfully with TOR before I did it myself.

				Guys im sure you have herd this before and know this but Purchasing bitcoins is in no way Illegal. So even if you do get ID or whatever its not really a big deal. The main thing is you make you fog or tumble the coins somewhere or whatever and last time i checked even SR when sending them here has a tumbler in place and helps to a certain degree. I just decided to use Bitinstant yesterday for the first time since 1st of last month and to my surprise my normal option is gone! I really enjoyed how easy it was to print the amount the go to my place i send the money and then come home and watch on blockchain as the money comes through, I thought about using Mt.gox and even went and set up a account but i was only gonna add like 80bucks so i just decided to say the hell with it, find some stuff my way. From what i read though bitinstant will have our old options back in a couple weeks..

				I&#039;m pretty fucking pissed Bitinstant removed the bank deposit option and the send to wallet option...both of those were highly used and I know a lot of bitcoin users chose those options....so it&#039;s funny when Bitinstant just tells everyone &quot;oh it&#039;s for the better! we were trying to move away from bank deposits anyways!&quot; Everyone that has commented on their blog update even told them that they used their service because of the bank deposit option.<br /><br />*Sigh* I hope they figure something out or work out some kind of new deal to bring in some better bitcoin buying options.

SR has a decent coin tumbler that anonymizes your coin once it&#039;s in your SR account and you technically you haven&#039;t done anything out of bounds for just sending coin to an SR address. You could be a coin changer for all they know. Even though they could be logging every transfer that goes direct to a SR bitcoin wallet, I think it&#039;s highly unlikely because what could they realistically do with that info anyway when the fogger stops the trail cold? It&#039;s not like they&#039;d bother targeting small time buyers in such a sweep. It wouldn&#039;t be worthwhile unless they were targeting vendors and the site operators, in which case they&#039;d more likely to try and track the coin coming OUT of SR. Not going in.<br /><br />In the future you might want to consider running it through a fogger for the extra layer of security and to put your mind more at ease.&nbsp; But I wouldn&#039;t get too hung up on a direct transfer from Mt.Gox right now. What&#039;s done is done.

				BitInstant is broken for me right now, I can&#039;t get a payment processed and I&#039;m a little upset.<br /><br />Anyone else unable to reach the site right now?<br /><br />EDIT: I called their office, they said it was a DDoS issue and they should be back up in a couple hours.
