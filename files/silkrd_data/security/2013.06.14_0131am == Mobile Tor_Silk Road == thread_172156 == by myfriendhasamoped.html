				how can you access silkroad on an iphone? Theres no way to download TOR that i know of. <br /><br />I think its possible with an android phone, that lets you download google play, but as far as i know it wont work with an iphone. <br /><br />Please share if there is a safe way to do it. Thanks!<br />

As far as Silkroad goes well thats another story. Correct me if im wrong, but I am under the assumption that all internet service providers can currently tell if you are using tor anyway. So what does it matter if its either A)- Your ISP who knows you are using it, or B)- Your phone company. As long as no one can tell what sites you access using tor and using tor itself stays legal, I for one would really like to have SR on my iPhone.

ISP&#039;s may have to start reporting all of the info they have to the government in some far away future (ha). Any information on you is bad information. I just wear a tinfoil hat and constantly freak out, though.

				Why would you visit silkroad from &quot;surveillance apparatus number 1&quot; aka smart phones?<br />I strongly recommend you to not use your phone to visit silkroad!
