				Just found this thread and noticed the tutorial was yours so i thought i would post this here as well:<br /><br />I have ran the GPG4WIN lite like was mentioned, check the right boxes, unchecked the others. Made it to the create key, no problems...as soon as the notepad screen was supposed to come up with the key I received the following error:<br /><br />&nbsp;GPGME library has experienced an error&nbsp; END OF FILE with a big red circle and a line in it. Click the repair button. but it just keeps coming back with the same error. I can see my username down in the address bar of the notepad but do not see a user key in the field it is supposed to be in?<br /><br />I have uninstalled and reinstalled this thing 5 times with fresh reboot every time...Now when I reinstall, it will not allow me to make a new key, just skips over to the above screen and error? Went into control panel, C: / Doc settings and deleted all traces of GPG but must be missing something that will not remove itself at uninstall???<br /><br />Tried doing a search before coming in here with no avail, any help would save me from throwing this box thru the window! Thanks for Any input into this!!!

				Thanks for the direction, and I also read Vlads tutorial as well. My mistake for not going with the first link. <br />GPG4WIN is a bitch to scrub, that software leaves much to be desired...guess it works for some.<br />&nbsp;I have read a lot of your post and will heed your advise. Thanks again for the help you offer up here!
