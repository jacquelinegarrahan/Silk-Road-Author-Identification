				i hear to never use clearnet and darknet at the same time on a pc but does this apply when you have multiple computers on a home network? eg. one using liberte or tails and one clearnet pc with windows?<br /><br />and if anybody has the knowledge can they explain how it weakens personal security to use clearnet and darknet at the same time if one is at different websites using different browsers? <br /><br />also is it unsafe (isp detection wize) to have tor sitting there and running for hours at a time - should you be on and off dark netas soon as possible?

				The only security risk from the two computers at the same time is if one such as the clearnet one isn&#039;t properly secured, say using Windows XP SP1 with no updates and antivirus, and was compromised. It could be used as a beach-head to attack all the the other computers on the network, although this is fairly unlikely.<br /><br />Your ISP can tell you are using Tor, I don&#039;t see how using it for more or less time makes a difference. They monitor the traffic anyway, so if its sat their idle not doing anything then they won&#039;t see much traffic . You can hide the fact you are using Tor by using unlisted bridges and obstuficating your traffic. More can be found out about that on the forum / tor website / Google.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s only going to be a problem for high risk users under surveillance. Consider this: LE watches you come home and visit your personal facebook, then tor fires up followed by your SR account logging in. A reliable pattern of this kind of activity can be probable cause for a search warrant depending on where you are and how the judge is feeling that day. The average buyer likely won&#039;t be under direct surveillance by the feds, and as oscar said, simple steps like using bridges will keep tor activity out of your ISP&#039;s logs in case of warrants for your past internet use. Yeah, I know, DPI can now detect tor regardless of what IP you are connecting to, but I don&#039;t think most US ISPs deployed it at this level yet. That will likely change, so let&#039;s hope tor either strengthens their protocol or builds obfusproxy into the browser bundle.<br /><br />Another potential issue is wifi. The feds may be able to tell which computer you use to access SR even if they don&#039;t have your key. All they have to do is correlate data from your network card&#039;s MAC address to your activity on SR and a clearnet site linked to your identity. If you change the MAC address every time and don&#039;t use the clearnet, it will frustrate their efforts to link SR to you personally.
