				Suppose this scenario takes place. You&#039;ve been a regular around for sometime with orders coming through normally. Then one day out of the blue 2 orders come that require a sig. The first one comes from a newbie vendor and you tell yourself wtf. Then a following order comes requiring a sig. You now know something&#039;s amiss. So now you stop any further orders.<br /><br />Suppose too that maybe there&#039;s a LE sting is going on by one of the vendor themselves&nbsp; or the vendor&#039;s mailings are being monitored? There&#039;s no way you can report this w/o proof (you don&#039;t have any) w/o groundlessly accusing a legit vendor. LE&#039;s perfect setup. I see only one way to put a stop to this kind of setup or fishing by le.<br /><br /><br />There no clean way to identify something like this, but I believe there is one thing we can all do and would require participation by&nbsp; everyone--everyone who has been ordering product. This would be to start a thread titled maybe (this just is an example from the top of my head) &quot;List of vendors that sent pkgs with an unanticipated sig requirement.) It&#039;d be simple and perhaps show a trend. This wouldn&#039;t impinge upon legit vendors--they would want to know as well. This list would no way indict the vendors, if they are legit and did not require a sig, then both we and he would know something was up. Same with the LE stings.<br /><br />This happened to me btw after I explicitly asked that they do not use a dcn or tracking of any kind even after telling them I would fe early. I stated that if I didn&#039;t receive the pkg,&nbsp; I would eat the lost as a cost of doing business. And I would do this with long time vendors only. I never made &quot;big&quot; orders either (as in trafficking amounts.) I think my mistake was using a relatively new vendor who to my dismay used no stealth packaging as well.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t going to be an issue anymore for me as I can no longer use sr because of this--I&#039;m not going to take any chances. Now it will be purely street purchases, but I advise anyone who begins to get pkg&#039;s that require a sig to be highly suspicious particularly if it&#039;s one of the more LE sought after schedule one drugs. (btw, the 2 pkgs that I received contained pretty innocuous drugs, but I can assure you that previous pkgs would have been very problematic. Now the house is clean. I can sleep better now, but w/o DOC&#039;s, life could better) .

				You obviously don&#039;t understand how a controlled delivery works.&nbsp; They don&#039;t just have you sign then continue to let you live your life or make more orders.&nbsp; They bust in your residence THAT SAME DAY!

				Is there any possibility of you finding a reliable, discreet, mail forwarding business, <br />perhaps one outside of your home country ?&nbsp; That way, you could avoid exposing<br />your own address to vendors.<br /><br />Finding a reliable, discreet, mail forwarding business.. <br />however... might be very problematic.&nbsp; I have no experience in this area.<br />Perhaps others reading this know better... or have experiences to share ?<br /><br />Are there any reliable, discreet mail forwarding business out there.. ??<br />perhaps inconveniently located in Thailand, or Singapore.. <br />.. or somewhere else far from the reach of Officer Dibble&#039;s truncheon.<br />

I recently had 2 CD&#039;s (i.e., requiring my sigs) delivered. I wasn&#039;t too concerned for the first--it was a cIII and just thought the vendor was fukked up. The 2nd one occurred when I ordered some mj seeds. My wife signed for them (she&#039;s clueless).&nbsp; I knew then at this point that I was being targeted (as I contacted one vendor who denied reg&#039;ing a sig.) So now I&#039;m fukked. What&#039;s worse is that I currently have a couple of pending orders with some serious shit. I&#039;ve pm&#039;d them to cancel, but it&#039;s the end of the road for me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been around here for over a year and never had an issue until now. It&#039;s been good while it lasted. I have no idea how they pin pointed me either. I guess I&#039;m lucky they didn&#039;t have a warrant when the 2nd one was delivered. Now I&#039;m prepared. This is so fukked up....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and you implied it by talking about LE watching vendors shipments and then shipments coming with a signature.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t how it works.<br /><br />If an order comes with a signature when it wasn&#039;t supposed to and you don&#039;t get busted by police that same day, it is due to the postal service or a vendor error.

You do not mention it here but you did post the other thread about the situation where many knowledgeable people responded to you and explained that this is more than likely the error of the vendor and quit possibly the post offices new policy where by requiring different checked/unchecked boxes for signature refusal and request.<br /><br />You obviously have not bothered to read the posts and taken the time to digest what these experienced people have told you. Now if only a couple of people gave you some advice and there were many different opinions on that subject then I could understand you not believing them. Clearly there were many that had the same reasons and logic that this has happened.<br /><br />Now, let&#039;s pay attention to what people are going to offer as good advice. This idea is full of holes. You want vendors to come on here and make a list of the orders that have been made that either do or do not require a signature? Are you kidding? You say you are and have been a long experienced member here. With this idea I find it hard to believe you have been here for any length of time, and if you have you are certainly not experienced with how this place operates. There is no vendor that will be taking the time to come to the forums to post how many packages have been shipped and have or have not required signatures. No fucking way.&nbsp; I am going to stop now before I become more irritated with the stupidity of this. <br /><br />Pay attention to what these real experienced people have to say, and stop spreading fear and unfounded rumors fueled by your own paranoia.&nbsp; :)

				ok, I guess with all the comments by the majority telling me I&#039;m off base, I have to believe them. <br /><br />By being here a long time, I looked at my stats, and without being too specific they are: purchases: 50+, btc spent btc1000+, member: 1 year.&nbsp; Another thing, I&#039;m been using everything under the sun since woodstock and never been busted, so I can&#039;t speak from experience about being involved with le.

Please don&#039;t miss understand me when it comes to erring on the side of caution. I am and have been the same way and would recommend this to any and everyone that feels &#039;something is not right&#039; you can hardly go wrong with being cautious. I hope in time you will find another way to enjoy the offerings of the SILKROAD..&nbsp; Be well&nbsp; :)
