				&nbsp;I noticed several threads recently that were talking about some problems with intersango, in the UK. I read through a thread or 2 but I couldn&#039;t conclusively decide that it&#039;s safe to buy BTC via intersango for someone in the US, or if the problems are only in the UK. If someone who has maybe bought/tried to buy BTC from intersango then send them to SR in the past day or two, that would be nice if they could post with their experience.<br /><br />Sorry if this is a duplicate thread. I checked the first 7 pages of the security sub-forum and didn&#039;t see any other than the ones I read, but I&#039;m tired so I may have missed one or 2.

				hello there. i am from the UK and have used Intersango many times in the past and have had no complaints. they have a very efficient customer service support. I just deposited money on Friday and am waiting for it to appear in my account before I transfer it to SR. I will update you when this happens :)

				well, I stand corrected. Even though I only deposited a small ammount into my account this time, I have had no joy in having my account credited with it. Their customer service has let me down for the first time and I am not sure why. Annoying because I alwyas gave them great reviews &gt;:(
