				For the sake of everyone here and the overall Bitcoin movement, I like to believe those who say SR is just a very small slice of the BTC economy. <br /><br />However, when the ups and downs of the BTC value very closely mirrors the availability of our particular market, I can&#039;t shake the feeling that it&#039;s more than just a coincidence. <br /><br />Too bad I&#039;m too broke to be a speculator ... actually maybe it&#039;s a good thing.

				same here, SR is the only reason i use BTCs, if i could use them for other stuff i would happily do so, but since discovering BTCs i have yet to find a use for it outside of here.<br />i live in hope that someday it&#039;ll be a valid currency in most online shops

				i believe that bitcoin value is influenced by SR.&nbsp; there&#039;s virtually nothing else you can use it for. and even those merchants who do take it&nbsp; provide little incentive for customers to use it over their own currency. we probably we won&#039;t see bitcoin used much outside of the blackmarket any time soon, which sucks because we need a wider market to avoid these giant fluctuations

				I can&#039;t get rid of the feeling you guys have no clue what you&#039;re talking about.<br />There is a huge fucking much of speculation going on.<br />then the illicit stuff market is much bigger than silkroad.<br />And then Bitcoin as commodity is big as well.<br />Also, for example, I just came via bitcoins to the silkroad though I was around at such places, but not with bitcoins.<br />Thinking that Bitcoin is not more than silkroad is pretty ignorant and as well showing that you didn&#039;t come here before silkroad was so fucking popular.<br />Greets, M

				I don&#039;t believe that bitcoin price and silk road are very much related. If you head on over to bitcoin-otc you&#039;ll quickly realize the price changes are little more than coincidence. Unfortunately, people are going to believe what they believe and there&#039;s little you can do to change their mind.

				The value has been slowly receding with mtgox being unavailable.&nbsp; The use of BTC as a currency to buy products has not diminished though.&nbsp; If anything, having a major exchange down for an extended period of time should have increased the value but it hasn&#039;t so that would indicate that people are using other currencies to complete transactions instead of BTC.

It&#039;s as others in this thread said: It&#039;s not going to be used for anything else but investments, and black market dealings for quite some time. There is no reason for the average, government-friendly citizen to use bitcoins. It carries huge risks with it, but you can also make a huge amount of money. For most people, the risks are too great to be serious about investing in bitcoins.<br /><br />Open up a bitcoincharts.com, set the time frame to 1 year (hopefully you are using Mt Gox USD)<br /><br />Firstly, we notice that the chart is going downwards, this started around mid-2011. We see that it hits a reaction-low... It typically reaches a figure that is not yet stable with current market trends, but because of it&#039;s low price, everyone tries to invest at once... (Mid-October 2011 - Spikes up by about 33%) because of the demand, price spikes up, no one wants it... it hits a record low. NOTE: This is just reading it off the charts. All my values are approximate.<br /><br />IMO, the main reason why bitcoins picked up after Mid-November 2011 is because of the huge volume that Mt Gox bought (like, 390k?). They did this just as it dropped by something like 15%. Right after that? Bitcoin prices become more expensive. Now, I don&#039;t know how much of an effect Mt Gox has on bitcoins right now, but when it was losing it&#039;s value... Mt Gox pretty much took over the market and had quite a degree of influence on the prices. To be honest, Mt Gox seems a bit fishy to me simply because of this. They&#039;ve had market dominance since July 2011. The market crashed in August 2011. Kind of a perfect timing, y&#039;know. But I don&#039;t know the specifics of this so I&#039;ll stay away from it.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t on SR during the 420 sales... I was at home. Broke as fuck. Texting a mate who was getting high for a vicarious experience LOL.<br /><br />420 sales? Oh yes, lets look at the impact of the 420 sales on the bitcoin economy: BZZZZZT derp. Either everyone already had money for the sales before it was announced, or silkroad is only a small dent in the bitcoin economy... And it is true. Silkroad is only a small dent in the bitcoin economy (and the admins were still able to somehow fund a free cruize, iphones and what not).<br /><br /><br />All of this information... could have been easily predicted (except the 420 sales.. lol) with the use of charts.<br /><br />It has been breaking resistance over and over again. If you would like, change the Time Period to All data. The economy looks to be heading for another moderate drop before the year is through (I don&#039;t know if we&#039;ll ever see a drop like the one that started in August 2011... Simply because no one will let the prices get that low...) <br /><br />Oh, and yes as BigScrote mentioned, it is indeed just speculation, however nothing is to say you shouldn&#039;t try speculating... who knows, you might just find yourself to be good at that :P<br /><br />

I doubt we`ve reached that amount yet. Whats happening with the Euro is different, it lost value because it was exposed. Meaning that they were basically moving around money/funds/stocks that weren`t there. The greek government is at fault, the union should have checked their records instead of being enthusiastic to invite another country.

				Isn&#039;t it a lot smaller.. like 8M mined, 20M total or something. Not sure.. I&#039;ll look it up later.<br /><br />In any case, the cost to mine now exceeds the value of the coin itself so I assume it will be left to the botnets or future advances in computing to uncover the rest :) <br /><br />
