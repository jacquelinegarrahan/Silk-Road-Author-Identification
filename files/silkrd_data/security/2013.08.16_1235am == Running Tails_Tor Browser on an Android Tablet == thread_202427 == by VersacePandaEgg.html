				Has anyone successfully been able to run Tails on an Android tablet? I recently obtained one and have been trying to figure out how to browse securely on it.

				First root your tablet so you have real access to the network stack. Now install Orbot and grant it root access. The Tor browser is shit so grab a copy of Firefox and turn the secuirty settings up to 11 (always start in private browsing mode, don&#039;t remember anything etc etc). Set Firefox home page to check.torproject.org. In Orbot settings choose applications and select Firefox for transparent proxying. Reboot tablet, start Orbot, start Firefox.

My tablet is rooted etc but I haven&#039;t really played around with transparent proxying.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Orweb and orbot are both part of the guardian project to build a secure ROM for android devices. Last I heard the dev was making it UNrooted for security reasons (I&#039;m thinking more exploits might be available on a rooted device)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Using a modification called Multirom, (only available for a couple of devices) you can have a multi boot android device that can be booted into several different ROMs. You can also install some Linux distros, and boot from USB. I have Bodhi Linux alongside some android ROMs; can&#039;t get it to do much, I don&#039;t know if this is because the installation doesn&#039;t work properly with multirom, or more probably, because I know nearly fuck all about Linux. Got command line gpg working but that&#039;s about it. It doesn&#039;t seem to be able to &#039;see&#039; any of the other files on my storage. When I had a dual boot Linux/windows xp box, you could browse the windows files from the Linux side. Anyway.....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What I&#039;m saying is it seems like in theory someone with the skills (not me) could get tails or liberte working on android devices. Its worth keeping an eye on the guardian project and multirom, to see if anything more useful develops

Then you encrypt the phone normally, then you download EncPassChanger from the play store. Then give it root priviledge and change your encryption password to something more complex. Only use up to a 16 digit passcode for your encryption or it will fuck up big time and you&#039;ll have to factory reset(another design flaw). The EncPassChanger doesn&#039;t even try and stop you from using a passphrase larger than 16 characters either.
