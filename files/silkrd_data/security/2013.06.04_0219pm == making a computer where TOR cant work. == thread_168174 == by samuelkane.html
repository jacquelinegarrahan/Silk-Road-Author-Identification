				I left rehab cause i was missing home and freedom to much this week.<br />I had big plans for staying clean and whatever other bullshit my mind tricked me with.<br />I lasted 3 days before ordering online again.<br />I&#039;ll be rejoining rehab soon but one of the things that needs to be done and remove my computer from my room. And make it so i cant access TOR.<br />I&#039;m pretty good at googling and finding alternatives, it needs to pretty damn foolproof. My brother in law works in IT, i&#039;ll let him do it.<br />But i havent got a clue how to this and my B.I.L has never heard of TOR.<br /><br />Any refererals, tips and help are very welkom.<br /><br />The first thing they try in rehab is make you break with your old lifestyle, usually friends and locations.<br />Ive learned now the biggest evil of SR is that its right in the privacy of your home and you can escape it....<br /><br /><br />Many thanks for all willing to help!<br /><br /><br />sam

I bet porn addiction has gotten worse for some people for the same reason. You used to have to suffer the indignity of walking into a seedy porn shop to get porn and it was expensive. Now it&#039;s piped into your home, and there there&#039;s more free porn on the internet than you can watch in a lifetime.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, to answer your question, I would tell you to give your brother in law administrative control of your computer or router and download a blocklist that includes the Tor entry guards, but Tor offers circumvention techniques that make blocking all access to the network difficult.<br /><br />Even if torproject.org is blocked, you can get the browser bundle emailed to a Gmail or Yahoo account. You can use bridges that aren&#039;t on a block list. If you are determined enough, you can get around the barriers that someone else puts up.<br /><br />Maybe give him all your money so you can&#039;t buy bitcoins? Then he can give you a daily allowance for food and stuff.<br />

				it&#039;s not really possible to block tor. You can always boot your computer from bootable usb or cd and as long as you have internet connection and can browse web pages you can use tor.

I work in IT myself and know all about blocking people from doing things! There is stuff you can do to stop you being able to access tor from windows but you would still be able to boot into a live CD or USB which would overrule windows! Also with a quick google search you could soon discover how to get passed windows security and remove passwords from the admin account!<br /><br />Maybe if you removed the disk drive and usb ports it would make it a bit better!<br /><br />depends what other things you want to use you computer for but you could just scrap the computer and get a tablet (not ipad tho as this has an .oinion browser)

				You can set a BIOS password, many BIOSes can be configured to block booting from removable media... <br /><br />But I think the solution you need is more like removing the pc from your room for a while... Even then, you&#039;ll always have the chance to get connected, be it at home or in public computers... <br /><br />I&#039;d say get away from your computer for some weeks and see how you feel... you&#039;ll eventually have to learn to live with your computer there, and just don&#039;t order stuff you don&#039;t want to.

				Pretty much anything you try to do can be circumvented. The Chinese government cannot consistently block Tor, I don&#039;t think you will have much luck blocking yourself from Tor in a more free country.

I though you meant a boot password for some reason! Yes your right this would work but again with a quick google search you could work out that by removing all power from the computer and taking out the bios batter for a while this can reset the bios thus removing the password!
