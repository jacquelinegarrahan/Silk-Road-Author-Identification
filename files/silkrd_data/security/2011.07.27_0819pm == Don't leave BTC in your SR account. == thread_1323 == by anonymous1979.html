				Nope. I only use this username and (now changed) password combo for this forum, SR main site &amp; MtGox. But I&#039;d forgotten I even had a MtGox account once the canadian site opened up. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s the only place that it might&#039;ve been snagged from, but who knows how the hell it happened there.

They left .23BTC behind, as what, a pity remainder? I dunno. But checking blockexplorer today shows that the address they were sent to hasn&#039;t redeemed them and they seem to have just up and vanished. So how does that happen?

				from my personal experience, never leave any funds whether it be BTC OR USD in any account.&nbsp; &nbsp;transfer funds to your wallet as soon as you can.&nbsp; just leaving funds out there in cyberspace is asking for trouble....
