				Hi Silkroad Forum Members,<br /><br />I made this topic because a lott of my customers ask my if i accept other currency payments and that takes for my a huge time to exchange it.<br /><br />Create a account at neteller (u can use fake phone and address).<br />Create an account at virwox (need secondlife account).<br />Create an account at second life.<br /><br />Netteler accept huge different kind of currency and other payment vouchers so u can deposit there your money and then transfer to virwox and exchange to lindendollars and then to bitcoins.<br /><br />This process can take up to 1 a 4 hours to get your bitcoins here in your silkroad account.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />With process and exchange currency u lose minimal 7 a 15% of your deposit money.<br /><br />Greets DutchShop,<br />

				Hi dutchshop,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using the exact same method you are describing. You don&#039;t need a Second Life account though! I just add funds NETELLER -&gt; VirWoX, then exchange EUR/SLL, then SLL/BTC. I don&#039;t have a Second Life avatar and it works for me!<br /><br />Just yesterday i found a new service though. It&#039;s from a SR vendor. The website is<br /><br />#http://realgg.nl/index.php/exchange-service/164-ukash-to-bitcoin<br /><br /><br />As you said, you lose 15 to 20 percent. With Real G&amp;G it&#039;s always exactly 15 percent fee. First I thought he is a scammer, but I successfully transfered a 20 eur voucher ukash to 4.6 BTC. That is okay and it took just a couple of hours.<br />With VirWoX you have to wait 48 HOURS! Until now it has pretty much been the full 48 hours.<br /><br />Feedback would be appreciated! Don&#039;t know if I can fully trust this website. It worked well once, but the whole site doesn&#039;t look too serious.<br /><br />greets

				I&#039;m a bit lost... How anonymous is this: <br /><br />Buy Ukash voucher -&gt; change into BTC via (for instance) Real G$G&#039;s. (assume you have a bitcoin adress made via tor at an exchance). In this case it isn&#039;t necessary to change it through Virwox? <br />&nbsp;<br />Or: buy BTC for cash in person (f2f or mail) -&gt; let it send to a bitcoin adress made via tor. In this case it&#039;s also not necessary to tumble it trough the virwox process? <br /><br />How about buying BTC at an exchange with your own bankaccount, than via Virwox do the linden dollar to btc thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				What do you mean bitcoin address made via tor? Do you use online btc wallets?<br /><br />Real G&amp;G exchanges your ukash directly to btc with a 15% fee. No virwox needed. working good so far and anonymous. they say they might ask u for personal information, but they wont.<br /><br />btw virwox deleted my account (and kept some of my money). anyone else??<br />i think i might just use btcmarket24 or mtgox in the future. less fees, less anonymity.

				I&#039;m sorry that I have to bump this old topic but I feel kinda assraped :/<br /><br />I&#039;ve previously got Bitcoins with a paysafecard for a relatively good rate. The first time at 3.80€ and the 2nd time at 4.20€. <br /><br />Last week I&#039;ve purchased another paysafecard for 50€. But I&#039;m unable to exchange it now. It&#039;s from Germany, Neteller doesn&#039;t accept paysafecards from Germany anymore. My previous trader&#039;s account got locked and the only vendor that I&#039;ve found on SilkRoad, AmsterdamShop who offered exchange at a rate of 4.20€, has been offline since 7 days. <br /><br />When I go to VirWox to exchange it I&#039;ll have a fee of 20% and I&#039;ll end up with 9.57 BTC... for 50 Euro :( I need at least 11 BTC. <br /><br />I now have this paysafecard and I have no idea what to do with it. Everyone I&#039;ve asked either doesn&#039;t accept Paysafecard anymore, is unable to or ran off. Since I&#039;m still a student with no job currently this is a lot of money for me, about 20% of my total capital. I&#039;d be happy if someone could help me out. Otherwise I&#039;ll try to sell it offline for 45€...<br /><br />Sincerely
