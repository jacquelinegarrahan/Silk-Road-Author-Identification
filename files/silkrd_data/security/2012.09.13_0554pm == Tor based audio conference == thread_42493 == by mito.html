				Jesus, it&#039;d sound exactly like a Stephen Hawking convention.<br /><br />I mean, everybody would be obfuscating their voice.<br /><br />More importantly, there are anonymity problems with this concept due to timing attacks and/or intersection attacks, see my post here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44183.msg476928#msg476928<br /><br />I actually do think it is a cool idea mito, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s impractical for us. In fact I don&#039;t know why I haven&#039;t heard of this occurring before, audio forums or something, where everybody in a thread can talk to each other, some kinds of sophisticated&nbsp; limitations so there isn&#039;t too much confusion, aided with software, some kind of &#039;pass the talking pillow&#039; system. It&#039;s an interesting software idea although there are obviously lots of caveats, I wonder if there&#039;s any implementations out there on clearnet. Hmmmmm...

They can see the data arrive at the other end. If you can see a packet transmitted through Tor at any point on its path, you can use a timing attack to identify that packet at any other point you can see it at. So the attacker in your proposed scenario can simultaneously monitor traffic and immediately determine if a packet they see being routed through one of their nodes is the same packet they see arriving with the voice data at the end of the circuit.

				Yeah, that seems to be on the level of the tempest attack and monitoring the fluctuations of electrical current in your home as a form of keylogger, at least the level those kinds of attacks were on back in the day.

But still...<br /><br />Anyway, the defenses are trivially easy to implement against such things, even places like banks or embassies do it (not that it helps if all the bars and restaurants in a certain&nbsp; radius are bugged, ha!).<br /><br />1. Obtain a cheap Chinese NIC with cash or rip one out of a second hand computer from a garage sale.<br />2. Turn a room into, or easier still, put a protective Faraday cage over your hardware. For people who were asleep in physics, replace Faraday cage with &quot;metal box&quot;. e.g. Trash can.<br /><br />Ta da!
