				I made the stupid mistake of exchaning text messages with some friends concerning some product. my friend went so far as sending me a pic showing an item, pulled from a drug discussion clear net site, asking if this is what i had. should i request a new phone number? i know this questions sounds stupid, but i&#039;ve been very good with remaing anonymous with all my bitcoin transactions; and have made the move to tails; and adopted all other safety measures. but my cell phone is making me worried.

				Was it a prepaid phone bought with cash and activated from public wi-fi or something similar?<br /><br />If it&#039;s a contract phone that you get a bill for or they know your contact info, getting a new number is not going to change the fact that those texts and pics are linked to your personally identifiable info. One possibility in that case could be to claim the phone was lost/stolen if there is an issue? Not sure how well that would work though, especially if you had it in your possession or used it since then.

				While that was most definitely stupid and getting a new phone/reporting your old one stolen would be smart, I highly doubt you will get in trouble for that picture, or the messages. The stuff can likely be tracked, but probably wont. I know people who have texted explicitly about drugs and been dealing large quantities for years and not been caught, or even suspected, Yes it is very chancy, but LE is not on top of all the latest technological opportunities that they could be, yet. Many LE departments are severely limited by funding which can prevent them from utilizing various resources. <br /><br />On another note, what are they going to do with that text? They can&#039;t get a warrant to search your house based on a single text. It likely won&#039;t spark a full blown investigation. And it&#039;s very likely it won&#039;t be considered a major piece of evidence in any case unless of course they were already investigating you, which would mean they already have more pertinent evidence. <br /><br />Just my analysis. Even if you get a new phone, your old records will still exist, even if you switch phone services.<br /><br />I had a friend get busted for Heroin/Methamphetamine trafficking in multi-LB quantities and all they did was raid his house and charge him for the shit they found. They didn&#039;t touch his computers, or his phone records, though they did confiscate his phone initially to look at the stored data on it. They still never knew he got it all from SR, despite confiscating over half a million dollars in cash and drugs. Not even that seems to warrant a full blown phone-record search. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not a terrorist, I wouldn&#039;t worry too too much about your phone records... but it doesn&#039;t hurt to be safe/paranoid.

				Still I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much you can do. Once you leave a digital footprint, especially with an ISP or a phone company, it&#039;s permanent. If you change phones/providers, there will be records of it, etc, and they won&#039;t likely miss that if they ever decide to investigate you. I personally wouldn&#039;t sweat it. The damage is done, just try not to make mistakes like that in the past. The most you can do is clear most of the data on your phone like text/photo history and what not.

It&#039;s actually people like you with your editorializing about percceived references that are not there, that makes this forum feel less about information exchange and education. Put down the pipe, brush your teeth, and get some sleep. I don&#039;t even know why i am bothering responding to you, since anyone who read my post would see that it was a simple question that you chose to reframe as an indication of me trying to be self important. I asked in the spirit of trying to be as proactive about my SAFETY, and that is all. Your responses are filled with nothing but stupid stories and dumb narratives. But that&#039;s on you. People like you-- so aggressive and unhelpful in their responses, are what makes community forums suck. piss off

				WTF?&nbsp; Since when does it hurt to be paranoid?&nbsp; &nbsp;And since when do people on here flame someone for being careful?&nbsp; Whats wrong with asking if he should get a new phone for texting about drugs?&nbsp; Be glad that he cares!&nbsp; Do you know how many idiots go down over being careless on the phone?&nbsp; The police number 2 weapon (after a snitch) is the cell phone!&nbsp; Ok so you are probably small time and it will not hurt to text about drugs because most likely no one is watching you, but still it doesnt hurt to be careful.&nbsp; Do not do it again.&nbsp; Its already done, it will make no difference if you change your number. Especially if it was not a prepaid phone.&nbsp; If it is a prepaid phone you can just throw it out and get a brand new one with brand new number.&nbsp; If it was registered to your namme then nothing you can do.&nbsp; <br />Ok so good that you realize it was stupid thing to do.&nbsp; Just dont do it again.&nbsp; Its always a good idea to use good phone security.&nbsp; Dont talk and dont text about drugs on the phone.&nbsp; Also keep in mind.&nbsp; That the cops may not be watching you.&nbsp; But if they are watching someone you talk to, for example a large drug dealer that you know, then they will stumble across your number that way and when&nbsp; it comes time for the indictment they will sweep you up too.&nbsp; <br />

				It&#039;s a bit late for this, but in future use an &quot;off the record&quot; (OTR) client to communicate with your friends and clients. Gibberbot on a modern smart-phone, Pidgin with the pidgin-encryption package for the desktop.<br /><br />Rather than just people who do drugs or other criminal activity, encourage everyone to use it. People ought to be able to have a way to communicate privately in a free society, give everyone you know this gift.

				Strange rants aside, the answer is quite simple.<br /><br />You both delete the exchange on either phone and it&#039;s final.&nbsp; I suppose police could go dig into records but they clearly would only do that if it was necessary as supporting evidence.<br /><br />It all depends who you get busted by.&nbsp; I know of some whose computers were confiscated as well as phones etc.&nbsp; I doubt they bothered to contact the phone company because they obviously had enough even without searching computer and phone.&nbsp; However they will try and link your phone activity to something that can be perceived as an illegal activity.<br /><br />Anyway, i&#039;m not trying to say you&#039;re being &quot;self-centered&quot; (although the posts accusing you of such are in fact rather amusing - cheer up guys), but if you&#039;re nothing big then chances are they won&#039;t dig too deep.&nbsp; If it becomes obvious they might be facing something more complex than they thought, then who knows what will happen.<br /><br /><br />You&#039;re still being investigated by humans.&nbsp; They&#039;re part of a system, a machine, that defines most of what they do but they remain human.&nbsp; Thus they are unpredictable.<br /><br />In any case, delete the convo on both sides, stay safe with your happy activities and you won&#039;t have any problems.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a big deal.<br /><br /><br />But sir, I didn&#039;t think it was such a big deal...<br /><br />NOT A BIG DEAL?!?!&nbsp; I&#039;ve got something here to show you!
