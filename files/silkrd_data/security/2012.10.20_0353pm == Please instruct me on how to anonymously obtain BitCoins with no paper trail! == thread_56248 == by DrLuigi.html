				Hi guys, I need to obtain BitCoins to wire through to SR but it&#039;s very important to me that I leave no paper trail. How can I go about buying BitCoins without linking to any of my real information? And then how can I safely transfer the coins from a site such as BitInstant to SR without any link?<br /><br />Security is imperative as I am likely to be buying bulk orders semi-regularly...<br /><br />Thank you, appreciate your help.

				This information is everywhere, and 10 minutes with the search engine would have provided you with the answer. If you&#039;re concerned about not being personally linked to your SR activity, then I&#039;d advise that you spend some time on the forums learning, else you&#039;re probably going to make a mistake in your security setup.<br /><br />That said, if you don&#039;t want a &#039;paper trail&#039; from you to the coins, do the following:<br /><br />(It is assumed that you will be connecting to the internet via TOR for all internetting (.onion and clearnet), and that you will be on a public WiFi network, and not your own, home network.)<br /><br />1. Set up an anonymous email account through TORmail. <br />2. Go to bitinstant.com and select &#039;Cash deposit at Bank Branch&#039; &gt; bitcoin to email<br />3. Enter your TORmail address on the bitinstant site, and complete the transaction.<br />4. Follow the instructions on the TrustCash website, and select the bank branch you want to deposit in.<br />5. Ask a friend to make the deposit for you. Tell them it&#039;s for a bill. Or tell them it&#039;s for drugs.<br />6. Get a few instawallet addresses.<br />7. Claim your coins at your TORmail address.<br />8. Bounce them from one instawallet to the next (in varying amounts)<br />9. Send them through bitcoinfog (because you&#039;re paranoid).<br />10. Send them to your SR account.<br />11. ???<br />12. Profit!<br /><br />(Alternately, you can make the bank deposit yourself, but then there&#039;s your face on the bank camera.)<br /><br />Seriously, though. If you&#039;re concerned about your security, read the forums for a while before you order. It will help prevent you from making mistakes that might cost you your freedom or reputation.

				This link helped me to get the BTC&#039;s with no paper trail:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.0<br /><br />p.s. the bank teller never asks for I.D. or what the deposit was for, use cash btw.&nbsp; ;)<br />
