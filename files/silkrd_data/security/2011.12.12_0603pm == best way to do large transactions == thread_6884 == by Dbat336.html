				lets say someone has a source for wholesale amounts of a substance like say heroin... and he found someone that wanted to do ounce and heavier weight transactions, how is the safest way to do that? Is it safer to do it in person or to attempt to do that with escrow and send that amount in the mail? Ive only ever sent up to 3 grams at once in a package, never done kilos or ounces even. And if its done in person, how can you make sure the person is legit? <br /><br />Anyways im just wondering about this, i only do small amounts at this time, but in case i was to get into bigger amounts i wanna do it as safe as possible.

				Look at his ratings.<br /><br />The best way to do it, in my opinion, is to go halfies. Half before you send the package, and half on receipt. I would advise against a 1:1 meeting especially if you&#039;ve contacted this person over the internet.<br /><br />This is a very public site. Anything you post here is open to everyone&#039;s eyes.

				I would say never meet anyone in person. If you wanted to do something locally, it seems like you&#039;d want to do some sort of pickup. Receive half (if trusted) or all (if not trusted) the BTC, go plant the package somewhere, leave detailed instructions PGP after you&#039;re clear, and have them pickup and pay remainder, if any. If you&#039;re doing bulk by mail, then separate the shipment into smaller packages and spread them out over time. <br /><br />
