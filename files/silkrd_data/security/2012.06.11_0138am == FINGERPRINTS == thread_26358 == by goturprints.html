				For those that have problems with gloves.

				I got fingerprinted once by the cops after I was brought in for a Failure to Appear on a court matter and they fingerprinted my whole hand not the the fingertips, they even did the sides of my hands so I recommend some kind of gloves to cover everything to the wrist. Just my 2 cents on the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I know what your talking about but it is my understanding that a palm print on its own is not often reliable enough for identification. But that they added the palm print recently to aid in the strengthening of fingerprint identification.

				Fuckin sucks but yeah....go to a Wal-Mart with cash and buy a 50 or 100&nbsp; box of disposable latex gloves....<br /><br />First use 1 pair to pack the item.....(i recommend using 2 gloves on each hand)<br /><br />2)Go to home depot and buy some light light light sandpaper.....<br /><br />3)2 pairs of gloves again to place item in envelope or box <br /><br />3)gloves advised.....use that sandpaper to lightly &quot;wash the envelope)...The 5/0 can have fun trying to&nbsp; pull prints from a nicely but NOT OVERDONE (with the sandpaper)&nbsp; envelope if you do it this way....<br />If you do it right the envelope will look normal....and the prints you probably left on the enveloped when you picked up a stack of them at a&nbsp; USPS (i hope not wearing gloves but if you had the balls to do it then all the power to you haha )&nbsp; <br /><br />This winter take advantage of the glove factor and stash like a bear getting ready to hibernate....<br /><br />Mix your DCNS too...in another thread I made an asinine suggestion to get a bunch of them delivered to a friends friends address....that was retarded....Get DCNS from at least 4-5 different USPSes and mix them randomly....(Thanks Foxy :)<br /><br />4)Put Labels on BEFORE you stamp and seal (again 2 pairs of gloves)<br /><br />5)&nbsp; 2 pairs of gloves to stamp and seal , wipe the stamps and labels over firmly with a cloth or similar, ideally paper towels for those of us with tinfoil hats that worry a cloth thread could get stuck somewhere and trace back :0<br /><br />Its a bitch and makes me want to punch the wall by the time I&#039;m done, but worth it if you don&#039;t want to get fucked hard by a silly mistake...<br />Last of all I use a plastic &quot;courier bag&quot; with all my envelopes....when I drop them i just empty them into the box...no prints and it looks professional with one of the clear see through zip up bags....Always put your finished packed items in an enclosed bag that&#039;s been wiped out with some anti-bacterial wet wipes after every use....this way no dust from your home/apartment or worst yet, hair/pet hair&nbsp; remains inside and gets stuck to an envelope...still unlikely it would stay but still....the bag method ensures no hair or carpet fibers or similarly &quot;linkable&quot; items wind up on the package before you go to drop it :)<br /><br />Another IMPORTANT THING here folks....When you put your labels and stamps on....please please please....use 2 sets of gloves and make sure the aforementioned are flat against the box.envelope!&nbsp; if a corner is peeled up even the slightest bit it could catch some hair or skin or similar...<br /><br />Also BE CAREFUL using tape to seal any items.&nbsp; the outside ring of tape can easily get tobacco, hair, threads from carpets etc. stuck to it.....just look at a roll of white duct tape if you have some lying around, or some scotch tape better yet and you&#039;&#039;ll see what I mean!&nbsp; &nbsp;I keep all my tape in ziplock bags with the little plastic thing on top so I can open them easily and seal them knowing my prints arent all over the bag just in case :)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Nitrile gloves are much, much stronger than Latex gloves. You&#039;ll go thru 10 pairs of Latex for every one pair of Nitrile. They are blue, easier to work with, and cost roughly the same. You can find them right next to the Latex gloves at any Home Depot.<br /><br />Wear a pair of cheap cloth gloves underneath for additional protection, as well as to avoid getting your prints on the outside of the Nitrile&#039;s while grabbing them/putting them on. <br /><br />And plan for the future. As mentioned above, these days fingerprints, as well as palm-prints, are both stored digitally upon arrest in a state/nation-wide database. Additionally, with the limited number of vendors on SR, it would not surprise me either if their were a (specific) global SR-vendor database. You may not have been arrested yet, however considering you are an autonomous misfit breaking all sorts of laws and whatnot, you WILL most likely be sometime in the future, if only for a minor infraction. Then guess what?<br /><br />EVERY vendor should just assume Alphabet-soup from your country of origin has ordered (at least) one package from you. With the relatively small number of vendors on SR, in a Tor/GPG protected world, it&#039;s one of the very few options available to them. Simple, cheap, hand-delivered evidence. With the added bonus of being able to profile vendors, individual packaging/shipping methods, return addresses, shipping regions, ect. And just yet one more reason not to shit where you eat.<br /><br />Later...<br /><br />☀ℇɣểἠ℉℧ℜƮℍƺ℞☀<br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Always wear gloves when buying postage and packing materials <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Most postal workers will happily put your stamps in a bag for you if you ask kindly, especially if you ask while you are &#039;fumbling&#039; around trying to get your cash worked out. You can grab/buy packaging materials without gloves as well. Just be sure to dispose of the top and bottom boxes or whatever it is you may have touched.<br /><br />I would also take extra precautions for any buyer requesting a DCN. Not because it means they are feds necessarily, but if a letter/package gets dropped in random blue box&#039;s (at different times of day/night), the DCN will most likely not get scanned until it&#039;s reaches the nearest processing center. However, if you walk into a Post Office, a DCN get&#039;s scanned on the spot. I&#039;m certain there may be a few vendors here actually doing such things (especially if sending odd or over-weight packages, ect.). And that&#039;s a great way for them to snatch your picture, and possibly your freedom as well. Unless of course you use &#039;out of the way&#039;&nbsp; PO&#039;s without camera&#039;s (they do exist). <br /><br />Either way, I would use a unique return address for any buyer requesting one for the sake of mail-traffic analysis alone. Hell, I wouldn&#039;t re-use the same return address EVER for the same reason. USPS uses technology that captures both a digital image of each letter, as well as infared scanners to track addresses. Whether or not they feed this information into supercomputers (like they do using the very same technology to track license plates) is anyone&#039;s guess,. I wouldn&#039;t guess. I have friends with friends pretty high up at USPS, and they seem to think the possibility is there, but not being used. However, I&#039;d imagine if they were using it, it only be the VERY higher-up&#039;s at the Postal Inspectors office that would even know about it. <br /><br />All thee more reason to rotate (if not &#039;never&#039; reuse) the same one again. Mix things up. Yes, printed envelopes provide a level of protection against handwriting analysis, but if you only send printed envelopes, using the same return address, ect, you are also making their job much easier. Especially if you are using a printer that can be identified. There&#039;s a link/list somewhere of printers that leave no trace. <br /><br />Perhaps pay a friend or hungry hippy/homeless person $20 to (&#039;intentionally&#039; attempt to NOT use their actual handwriting) to hand-address some boxes/envelopes as well from time to time? Wearing nitrile&#039;s. ect of course. Perhaps even pay others to buy your stamps/supplies for you as well? That way your face is never exposed to a post office camera? Or don&#039;t.<br /><br />Later...<br /><br />☀ℇɣểἠ℉℧ℜƮℍƺ℞☀<br />
