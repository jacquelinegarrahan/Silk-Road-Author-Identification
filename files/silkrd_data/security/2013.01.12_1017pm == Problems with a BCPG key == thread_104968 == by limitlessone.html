				Came across a vendor using the BCPG implementation for his public key.&nbsp; I&#039;m having issues encrypting with it.&nbsp; From decidedly brief research I understand its outdated and not secure.<br /><br />Is it possible to still use?&nbsp; Its a fairly large vendor so I&#039;m surprised no one else has brought it up.&nbsp; Are that many people not sending secure messages?

Many of these BCPG keys feature encryption sub-keys that are only 512-bits in length -- this is laughably insecure -- 512-bit keys were being broken 20 years ago by individuals using spare hardware they had laying about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do yourself a big favour, and choose a vendor who takes the security of his customers seriously. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />

				Thanks, a search for &quot;BCPG&quot; hadn&#039;t given me many results.&nbsp; Good to know about that though.<br /><br />I&#039;m still surprised, this vendor has been on for 2 months, over 300 transactions and a key that doesn&#039;t work...how are people sending them their info?&nbsp; And if they can&#039;t are they sending it insecurely?!!

				Hey, I&#039;m a n00by as well, and I spent literally HOURS trying to figure this out. I think I may have gotten it, but take my advice with a grain of salt.<br /><br />&nbsp;Assuming you use GPA, <br />---your vendor should have a public key attached to his profile,<br />--- copy and paste that into microsoft word or note pad and save it to your desktop<br />---In GPA, you should see an IMPORT option at the top.<br />--- Select the word document and it should get that key and save it to your list of public keys.<br />--- Now if that vendor messages you, only you can decrypt his messages.<br /><br />Now if you want to send him messages, you have to personally send him your public key (much in the same fashion you did his).

				If I got anything wrong, please tell me. I&#039;m learning too.<br /><br />It&#039;s much better to learn as a group and help each other. <br /><br />Security is much too important, especially sensitive information (address names etc.), for prying eyes to see.

				Thanks g01d3n.&nbsp; I hope I&#039;m not misunderstanding you.&nbsp; I certainly could learn more about PGP.&nbsp; In this instance I&#039;m not having any problems actually importing the key in question.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently on a mac using PGPTools and while it imports it, it won&#039;t allow me to encrypt messages with the BCPG key.<br /><br />Now even if I could, from the little of what I understand and what Nightcrawler seems to be suggesting, the BCPG key implementation isn&#039;t particularly secure.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t used GPA or heard about it until now but it appears to be a windows application, right?<br /><br />
