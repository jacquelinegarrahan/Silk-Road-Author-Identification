				A casual glance at the hidden wiki phishing sites list (if the phishers haven&#039;t deleted it recently) will give you an indication of exactly how badly things have gotten over there.&nbsp; Please make sure everyone is going directly to http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/ and not relying on the links in the hidden wiki.<br /><br />Also, for those technically minded you can watch the history and undo any modifications that replace the valid Silk Road address(es) with phishing sites.&nbsp; If you have a feed reader you can subscribe to the atom link on the history page and get updates and a summary/diff of changes.&nbsp; <br /><br />We can discourage these attacks by being aware, verifying the links before typing our passwords in, and with the help of a few people watching the edits to that page and undoing any malicious edits as quickly as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you hit &quot;undo&quot; before another edit goes in it is very easy to undo things.&nbsp; If you leave it for a while the phishers start fighting and mangle the history so bad you have to undo multiple edits (hint: use the radio buttons, select the range you want to undo, click &quot;compare&quot; button, then on the top right there is an &quot;undo&quot; link above the right diff, which will undo all changes in that range).<br /><br />I like SR and don&#039;t want to have all the new people scared off by getting hacked right off the bat.&nbsp; It seems like myself and a few others are already watching the page, and you can see that it is consistently being restored, I mostly just want to ensure that everyone is being careful and is aware of the issue.&nbsp; Anyone can edit the wiki, it is probably not the best place to rely on for accuracy.&nbsp;
