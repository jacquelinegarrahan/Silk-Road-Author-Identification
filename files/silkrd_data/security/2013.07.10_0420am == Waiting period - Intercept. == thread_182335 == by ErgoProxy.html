				Hey guys, long time no type. <br /><br /><br />My apologies if this has been asked over and over again, and I couldnt find, after searching, any real specifics on this. Maybe it is unknown. I just thought perhaps there was still someone hanging around who used to work for the couriers. <br /><br /><br />I havent ordered in months, wont say how long exactly. Lets just say someone waited a few months. And let us also say that there was a single interception. Could someone possibly shed some light on this? Again, I apologize, I too cant stand duplicate threads. I just couldnt find the answers I needed. <br /><br />Much appreciated.

				i&#039;m not exactly sure what you are asking but i guess its if you can use an address that has been flagged again after a certain period of time (?)<br /><br />i would say it depends on what amount and kind of drug was intercepted in which country. but in general your best bet is to not use it again.<br /><br />cheers

				Im not too worried about it, so Ill just say its US. Pills. Not very many , either. It was kind of a blessing, though. It was getting out of hand with the amount I was on. I did not buy really that often, I made sure to space it out as to not get into any sort of routine which could be figured out, etc. Maybe if I was to get a different method for shipping, who knows. <br /><br />I appreciate the response.
