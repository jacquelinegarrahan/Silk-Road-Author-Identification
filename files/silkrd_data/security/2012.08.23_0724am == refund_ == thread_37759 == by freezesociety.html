				Title: <strong>refund?</strong><br />

				So I tried to order something from this one vendor, and it was 26.65 bitcoins for the purchase.&nbsp; But, since I used privnote, the vendor decided not to sell to me, which is COMPLETELY understandable and fine with me! So she cancelled the order, and I only received 25.60 bitcoins back.&nbsp; So I spent allllllll day learning how to encrypt, so I could send them a legitimate message with my address.&nbsp; Eventually, I tried to add the same order onto my cart, because I thought maybe the only reason they weren&#039;t going to sell to me was that I couldn&#039;t encrypt!&nbsp; So, I showed them that I could encrypt by placing the same order but sending an encrypted message the second time.&nbsp; In return, I got another order cancellation message that was another 1.06 off, with a very blunt message afterwards.&nbsp; I still dont understand why I was treated like this :/ I was just trying to be nice the whole time....&nbsp; But, I was wondering if there was any way for me to retrieve the whole refund instead of the lower amount that I got back....Thanks ahead of time!!!!

				It is probably because of the SR fees.&nbsp; Even with refunds, SR fees still apply I believe.

				The money lost is because the vendor was hedging their escrow. Read up on it in the Buyer&#039;s Guide.<br /><br />I am guessing you made that first vendor nervous due to the privnote. They are probably a long standing vendor with a strong customer base and the wiggle room to trust their gut. Did they require new buyers to FE in the fine print on their vendor page? Don&#039;t take it personal. I am sure you made some other vendor happy tonight.

				Okay, thanks for the information! I was never too worried about 2 bitcoins, it was actually more out of curiosity. :)&nbsp; I actually just felt bad enough for making them mad and stressed out!&nbsp; And I&#039;m hoping I DID make another vendor happy instead! I Guess we&#039;ll see! haha you people are so awesome and fast at responding, I love it
