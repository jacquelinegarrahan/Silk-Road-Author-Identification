				I have one trustworthy guy on localbitcoins.com, but I&#039;d be interested in a more reliable place as well. Any suggestions?

				I&#039;d say try Coinbase. You&#039;ll have to be verified up the ass, but worth it in my opinion cuz they have really low fees compared to other services.<br />The downside with them is that your first 2 transactions you gotta wait a week for them to go through. But after that it&#039;s supposedly instant, but I wouldn&#039;t know because they fucked me over both times. Maybe you&#039;&#039;ll have better luck lol.<br /><br />An alternative is Virwox. I&#039;ve used Virwox everytime so far. It&#039;s pretty simple to use, but they have some kinda steep fees. Not THAT bad, but definately higher than coinbase. <br /><br />Out of the 2 I would reccomend Virwox, if you have a little extra money to compensate for fees.

				This service works awesome: https://www.bitquick.co/&nbsp; (clearnet warning)<br />It&#039;s kind of a cross between bitinstant and localbitcoins. It matches bitcoin buyers up with sellers who will sell bitcoin for bank deposits. I&#039;ve used it and found it much easier than bitinstant moneygrams. <br /><br />mm

There&#039;s an escrow that if used should keep you from getting scammed. It stuns me that more ppl from SR don&#039;t use it to get their coins.

I buy and sell there. It&#039;s the only place I know where you can do transactions and remain relatively anonymous. Cash deposit or reload cards etc. Plus there is escrow.

				I&#039;ve had a few positive transactions with moneyhoney (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/609fdf0b36) <br />BTC deposited between 30min-2h every time except for today but it seems like a rough day for getting anything done quickly on SR

				I&#039;m a vendor and can get you coins if you need for little more than gox price. Kills most localbitcoins price and I offer the option of depositing funds yourself to BBT or Chase. Hit me up if interested. I&#039;m growing my portfolio, so I&#039;m offering great prices.
