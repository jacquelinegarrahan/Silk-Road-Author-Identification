				Yeah they&#039;re way too valuable for my liking at the moment, I don&#039;t like the volatility of bitcoins.&nbsp; If I buy 100 bitcoins now they could lose 40% of their value within a few weeks who knows.&nbsp; Of course I wish I&#039;d stocked up on bitcoins early last year when they were&nbsp; like 1/8th of the price, a buddy of mine did just that and is now reaping the rewards and pretty much getting free drugs, lucky bastard!<br /><br />edited : I meant to say last year not this year

				The relatively fast price increase is fueling demand to hold bitcoins, because bitcoins holders are speculating that their bitcoin holdings will be worth more tomorrow. If there were a sudden drop, the reverse could happen - bitcoin holders running for the exits.

				Yup. For those saying &quot;well I could have made money if I bought it low&quot;, well you still can. Because when it doubles in value and hits $30 tomorrow you&#039;ll be saying the same thing.<br /><br />The bitcoin value is integrally tied to the success of SR. The more traffic and popularity of SR, the higher the value of bitcoins goes. With SR having opened up to a host a new languages recently the sky seems the limit. There are many countries that don&#039;t yet appear to have caught onto SR. Perhaps their mail service is too unreliable or open to compromise (Russia) but I see huge growth potential in the emerging economically mobile countries like Brazil and China. And if home grown alternatives spring up in say Portuguese or Mandarin that provides direct competition to SR, well guess what? The bitcoin value skyrockets even more.

It&#039;s not like the market for bitcoins is exhausted. Probably only about 500,000 people use them. A year from now it could be 2 million, and 3 years from now it could be 5 million.<br /><br />IF the price went to $30 in the next month then I&#039;d say it&#039;s a bubble and you should sell, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if bitcoins were stable at $30 a year from now. In short, the price is still low and it&#039;s a good time to buy. :)

Yes, it went through a huge boom and bust in June 2011 after the first round of major media reports about it, when the baseline market was small and tons of people tested out bitcoins and then abandoned them. It went through another small boom and bust in August of last year, probably because of the pirateat40 scare.<br /><br />All time: https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?timespan=all<br /><br />Last year: https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?timespan=1year<br /><br />It could be going through another small boom and bust now, we&#039;ll see. However, if you follow the 3 year trend, on average it continues to increase, and at a relatively fast rate. As the market grow, it becomes more stable.<br /><br />Also, <br /><br />https://blockchain.info/charts<br /><br />http://bitcoincharts.com

But it stabilized at $5 and was at between $5-$6 as recently as 6-7 months ago.<br /><br />IMO, it&#039;s a fantastic long term investment. Think about it, it&#039;s the ONLY legit virtual currency. So it&#039;s got a monopoly on the online underworld. Many attempts have been made to take the open source bitcoin code, alter it a bit, and introduce an alternate competing currency. All have failed miserably. It&#039;s said that only the ingenious pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, has the kind of pull and rep to introduce a new currency. But first of all, he disappeared without a trace when the code was pretty much complete 3 years ago. Second of all, why would he? BTC is his baby.

				Here is the way I see it.&nbsp; &nbsp;From a broke perspective.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Say I bought $500 worth or heck even went crazy and got 1k.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now if it doubles in a year that is 2k,&nbsp; def nothing to retire on.&nbsp; &nbsp; What if it triples in a year?&nbsp; &nbsp;okay 3k.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is awesome but still I&#039;m not going to get rich off of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So for the normal joe,&nbsp; buy your bitcoins,&nbsp; use them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If your rich, then sure,&nbsp; buy 100k worth, because then and only around then would it be worth having the money tied up.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />My main concern, and I think the same is true for the majority of anyone on this forum, is how it effects SR,&nbsp; &nbsp; and luckily,&nbsp; no matter how high the prices rise,&nbsp; your drug of choice will always say right at, slightly overpriced lol.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Just my 2btc&#039;s*

				In the 6, 7 months I&#039;ve been paying attention they&#039;ve gone from 5 to what, 16 now? I&#039;d say it&#039;s a stable investment, or better yet good for a literally quick flip if you can find a way to buy, hold for a week, and sell for a good exchange. <br /><br />The popular BTC vendors are probably making a fortune. If I&#039;d plunked down $50k on BTC when I first got in to it, I&#039;d have a 200% return on it in under a year. Slightly risky, but only because cashing them out is difficult. <br /><br />
