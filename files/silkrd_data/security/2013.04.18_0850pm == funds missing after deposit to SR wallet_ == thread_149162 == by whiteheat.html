				So the past few times i&#039;ve deposited, i&#039;ve been out about $10-15.&nbsp; Not that big a deal but, i was under the impression that the btc price that SR uses is a little lower than the exchange that I bought them from.&nbsp; Either that or they straight up taking some from me.&nbsp; Could someone tell me how that works?&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure its the former, but even then, thats kinda shitty.

				Where are you exchanging your coins? Some sites use the daily average and not the actual price for the minute. In addition, there is usually an exchange fee so if you deposit $100 cash, you may only get $90 worth of BTC after the fees. <br /><br />If you attempt to purchase something on SR, it will tell you BTC rate currently held for the site. The rate fluctuates so much so it will most likely shift throughout the day.

				I&#039;ve seen several reports of this happening -- some discrepancy between the rates used.&nbsp; SR uses the Mt Gox Average whereas the places you are buying your coins from may be using something else.

				I know the feels bro, I bought $3000 worth of bitcoins during the week, only got $2100 in my SR account/wallet.<br /><br />Ruined my plans for a big purchase, made me start asking locally for a connect to what I am buying on here for the reason of losing money. <br /><br />SR is great and I love it don&#039;t get me wrong but if I keep losing this much money over and over it kinda defeats the purpose for me to be on here &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />the value of the market seems to be rising again so my money jumped a few hundred up already so it&#039;s closing in slowly.
