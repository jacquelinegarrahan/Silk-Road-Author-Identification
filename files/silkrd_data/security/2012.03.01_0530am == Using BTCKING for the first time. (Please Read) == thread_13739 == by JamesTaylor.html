				Hey everyone. I think I am ready to try my first purchase from SR. I been searching the forums and cant really find out much about this guy. Only a few thread, with not much information. So I have a few questions. Thanks for the help in advance <br /><br />1. First and most importantly is this guy legit? Hes reviews are good but i read somehwhere to be careful. However most ppl have said hes alright.<br /><br />2. Is this the easiest/ safest way to purchase BTC. He said all you need to do is make a deposit. <br /><br />3. Can someone who has done this before explain the depositing process. For example, steps you do inside the bank. Do they ask for ID??? And if they do Should i be worried???? I will be using BOA most likely. <br /><br />4. Lastly any helpful advice will be nice. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for taking your time and helping me out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keeponsmiling

				I&#039;ve used his service a couple times for just under a grand, overall its been decent. He has been very quick getting me my coins and communicating with me, and he uses multiple banks not just chase. Like cuba said, no name, signature, or ID required, at least when I&#039;ve deposited. Overall it has been very quick and easy each time. The downside is that his total fee has been higher than expected. There&#039;s the 10% fee, the $6 fee, and then his exchange rate has been high in his favor. Overall the fee has ended up being around 15%. Still not terrible but you should know this beforehand while making your decision.

				This guy is legit and straightforward.&nbsp; A great way to go if you are going to buy coins over SR.&nbsp; Like everyone else he charges an arm and a leg for his service, but his service is also airtight anonymous and fucking fast.&nbsp; Worth it if you are in a hurry.

Guess im going to give me a try tomorow. Kinda sucks that he charges so much. But I guess this is pretty much my only option. Not really great with computers and dont really understand the other ways of getting coins. Hope this works!

				Hes def not the absolute cheapest option but in my opinion by far the best.&nbsp; At first I followed SR&#039;s instructions and setup dwolla, mt gox, etc accounts and WOW what a hassle plus it takes forever, and I also tried to find instant service when BTCKING took a weekend off and literally could not find a single seller. After a day one vendor did re: to my pm saying they&#039;d prob be same/next day if i ordered early enough but no guarantees so I just ended up waiting for btcking where its a sure thing.&nbsp; Just like anything else you pay for quality.

BTCKing is definitely the pricier option of the sellers on SR, but the convenience of just depositing funds into his bank account and having your BTC 25 min later is unmatched. Makes things much easier than spending all that time waiting for DWolla &gt; MtGox or whatever else. I think most people on SR would agree to pay a little extra and get it instantly, vs paying less and waiting a while.

				@jmoney&nbsp; I really like his service to be honest. Communication was awesome all the way through. so ppl might complain about his fees but honestly I think its worth it. No hassle at all and you get your coins pretty instantly.It took about 45mins from when I made the deposit to receive my BTC.&nbsp; I payed about a buck forty and got 125 worth of BTC. All you do is just go to the bank and make a deposit. pretty anonymous imo. You dont need a ID or anything.&nbsp; I am most certainly going back to him <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keeponsmiling
