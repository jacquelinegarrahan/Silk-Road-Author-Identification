				Has anyone purchased the product from Enter the Matrix used to speed up your Tor Experience??&nbsp; Does it actually work and more importantly does it speed up your SR experience, that is when SR is working??&nbsp; I would really appreciate to hear from anyone that has installed it and had good and noticeable difference with their speed on TOR?&nbsp; Also is it safe, meaning by changing the settings it tells you to do it doesn&#039;t do anything to expose your identity or have any other security risks associated with it?&nbsp; I am trying to self educate myself by going through these forums on SR to learn more about security and what not but I know as a community I always try to help someone when they have a question because ultimately protecting one person might protect a lot more people than we realize.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any and all responses I truly appreciate it!! ;)

				I&#039;ve seen one suggestion posted on several forums, which is to increase the number of entry nodes. Don&#039;t do that. It will decrease your safety.
