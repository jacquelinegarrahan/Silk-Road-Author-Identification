				Cut three fingers off a latex glove. Triple wrap your shit. You know where to stick it.<br /><br />Just kidding. In my experience, security personnel at music festivals aren&#039;t looking for drugs, just guns and knives. You can hide your stash in many places, your luggage, your socks, etc., since they don&#039;t search very thoroughly, but that may depend on the festival.<br /><br />Now, if you get pulled over by a cop on your way there, that may be a different story. Pro tip: don&#039;t go to a festival in a hippie van or look like an obvious druggie. Cops may be sitting along the road right before the festival site.<br />

				I was definitely worried about police on the highways on the way to the fest. I&#039;ve been stopped before on my way to fests for stupid reasons, and my car isn&#039;t even close to being &quot;hippy&quot; or suspicious in any way really. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also seen the actual LEO officers at one particular fest do some really intense checks. Talking about pulling EVERYTHING out of your car, mirrors checking underneath, the whole 9 yards. <br /><br />Has anyone had success with stash cans? Or using shampoo bottles or something like that? I&#039;m probably being over paranoid, but the last thing I want to happen is to get arrested right before I was supposed to have an awesome weekend.

				Damn what kind of music festivals do you go to?<br /><br />Music festivals are so full of drugs it would be retarded for the cops to search as all the people attending would probably go to jail.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every music festival I&#039;ve gone too, they just check you at the front gate with a metal detector and your good to go.&nbsp; I can seriously just have like 50 x pills in each pocket and walk through, not that I would do that but you get my point.&nbsp; And I have never seen drug dogs there either, that must really suck.

				At Insomniac festivals every single person gets frisked and searched when entering. I&#039;ve even been asked to take my shoes and socks off, it&#039;s pretty hardcore. These festivals are anywhere from 45,000-135,000(EDC) people per day, so it&#039;s a huge operation. They even have drug dogs on site, but I&#039;ve never seen anyone get caught by the dogs.<br /><br />What I do is use packing tape and tape it on my balls and some more below my belt line. You would need to shave obviously, so if you&#039;re an overly manly dude that&#039;s afraid of shaving his junk, try taping it to your inner leg the highest you can go without losing losing the integrity of the tape on hair.

				I&#039;ve gotten away with wearing polymer-toe boots and hiding things deep in there thus far. You&#039;re up **** creek if they go hardcore and bring dogs though. We used to pay a &quot;decoy&quot; who just sifted through some weed to take the heat while we got in but it&#039;s been 4 years since I&#039;ve gone to a fest.

				Dude, shove it in your pants with your johnson. Me and all of my friends have been doing so for years, and not a single person has gotten caught. Honestly, I would be way more scared trying to get drugs at the festival like you have been doing. You put yourself in serious risk of getting incredibly bunk or dangerous substances, and getting arrested by an undo. Just shove it in your pants, security is never as tight as its advertised to be.

				Do you wear Nike shoes to events?&nbsp; The ones that have Nike+?&nbsp; If so, take your left shoe and remove the insole.&nbsp; Underneath it is where the Nike+ sensor goes.&nbsp; Remove the foam piece (or sensor if you actually use it) and place your stash there.

				Dude what kind of shows are you going to? That sounds like some real over-the-top security haha. But I could believe it I guess. I&#039;ve had great success with these: (cleanet) http://www.emazinglights.com/gray-stash-boxers-6583.html<br />The pocket really goes all the way down the front, along the penis, under the balls, and almost to the butthole. Lol. Here are some other options: (cleanet) http://www.emazinglights.com/stash-boxers<br /><br />DON&#039;T for a second think there aren&#039;t undercover police at shows.

				Thanks for all the replies. I really like the shoe idea. I have a pair of running shoes that have the removable notch in them, so I may try that. I wanted to avoid having anything on my person though, I&#039;ve always been way more worried about LEO finding something on my person as opposed to something hidden in my vehicle or whatever.<br /><br />Like I said there is like a 1 in 30 chance of getting picked for the &quot;thorough&quot; search involving the cops and dogs. The other 29 out of 30 are just searched by volunteers who don&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />But like another poster here mentioned I think the risk is honestly about the same as what I&#039;ve been doing (ingesting substances from whoever, not knowing how clean it is).

				Well, if you don&#039;t want anything on your person, there&#039;s a cool trick I read in another thread that might help. Get a pack of cigarettes, empty the tobacco out of one, place pills (or anything else that would fit) where the tobacco would go leaving at least half an each at the end to fill up with tobacco again. Do this with as many cigarettes as necessary and put them back in the pack as if they were normal. <br />Note that if it were me, I&#039;d put tobacco in between every single pill as well as both ends so they didn&#039;t rattle. Also, I&#039;d rather have the extra weight spread evenly throughout the cigarettes. Don&#039;t forget to identify which cigarettes have pills in them if you didn&#039;t use them all.

Get a pack of cigarettes, empty the tobacco out of one, place pills (or anything else that would fit) where the tobacco would go leaving at least half an each at the end to fill up with tobacco again. Do this with as many cigarettes as necessary and put them back in the pack as if they were normal. <br />Note that if it were me, I&#039;d put tobacco in between every single pill as well as both ends so they didn&#039;t rattle. Also, I&#039;d rather have the extra weight spread evenly throughout the cigarettes. Don&#039;t forget to identify which cigarettes have pills in them if you didn&#039;t use them all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />some events dont let in open cig packs for this reason :\

				I don&#039;t have specific advice on stashing, but please remember not to handle or be around smelly drugs in the run-up. I got pulled up at a random dog search at a central city subway station just because I was wearing a jacket that had been hanging in my room where I had smoked some weed 3 DAYS beforehand! Smell was a-clinging....<br /><br />SOME European fests pretty laid back, once on site most police are concerned with crowd concerns and peace and quiet, get it over and everyone home safe.<br /><br />At the daddy of them all, Glastonbury, a couple of years ago, a happy reveller offered a drink of his cider to a police officer walking past next to us. The officer declined with the nice response &quot;Not right now mate, I&#039;m off to have a spliff under that tree over there.&quot; !&nbsp; :D

				Resealing the packet of cigarettes would be the best option, me thinks. It would have to be done right though. You could carefully remove it on the top of the box instead of the seal-tearing bit. Then you could heat it to reseal.<br /><br />I think you should read the rules of your particular festival instead of arguing here because they are all different. Some don&#039;t even allow your own alcohol for instance and some are fine about it. Rules are clearly indicated on the website or on your ticket confirmation email.

I was watching others do the same. Some other people started getting too close and suddenly surrounded us. Turns out those people were undercovers. I was grabbed and taken off to the side. They searched my stuff and found something worthy of a felony. I was completely mistreated throughout the process. I wasn&#039;t sure if I was getting fucking being robbed at first. The prick handcuffed me before he searched me and even before he told me I was under arrest. I definitely had my rights violated but there was nothing I could/can do. If it happened again, I might be able to get them for it. Also, I talked a little bit and almost didn&#039;t get on the program I&#039;m on now (the program is preferable) because of the DA. Don&#039;t talk to them no matter how sad, scared, contused, startled, etc. you are!
