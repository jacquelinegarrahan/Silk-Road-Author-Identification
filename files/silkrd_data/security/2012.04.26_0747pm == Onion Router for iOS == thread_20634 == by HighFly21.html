				There&#039;s already another app called &quot;Covert Browser&quot; that also accesses TOR. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, after you try to sign in it takes you back to the original screen.

				The problem with covert browser is that it does not accept cookies, and thus, signing in to sites is impossible. I would recommend jail-breaking your IPhone, there are a lot of benefits such as being able to use it as a hotspot without incurring a monthly charge, and the ability to install TOR on it. TOR itself does not appear in the Cydia store, but there are tutorials on the web as to how to download TOR on an iOs device that has been jailbroken.

But Tor on Android on a data plan in your name is too risky IMO.

				Paranoid about the &quot;Onion Browser&quot; software?<br /><br />I created a step-by-step guide on how to install Mobile Tor and configure everything in iOS. You must have a jailbroken iOS device for this to work. This allows you to route traffic for all applications over the Tor network. This can allow you to use other applications such as IRC client etc over Tor and not just a web browser like you are limited to with the Onion Browser application.<br /><br />http://x35jfacrznhhtrfr.onion/tutorials/tor-ios/
