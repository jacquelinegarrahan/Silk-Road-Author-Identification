				Hey<br />Im looking to make my first purchase on the road and am wondering how you guys and gals are going about purchasing Bitcoins, im only looking to buy a few grams of greenery to get me started and have the possibility of using a debit card or cash.<br /><br />Im really just looking for the safest and fastest way to get bitcoins into my SR account, as its only a small amount of green im hoping to get up and running by monday if possible.<br /><br />A point in the right direction would be great.<br /><br />Cheers!

				There should be some good threads in the security section on bitcoins.<br />Spendbitcoins and bitpiggy I have had success with.&nbsp; Head on over to the security section, do a search and see what threads come up.&nbsp; Good luck!

				spendbitcoins is real easy my friend for first time, simple cash bank deposit and you&#039;re set.<br />but make sure you was your bitcoins through a few ewallets before you send to your SR account.

				It can be very very simple, or it can be a little more complicated.<br />Direct deposit from your bank account is obviously the simplest method....but considering SR, media attention, LE possibly targeting bank accounts from which the funds to buy bitcoins came, it&#039;s probably safest to go with cash deposit, ie spendbitcoins.<br />I never bother putting them through any other wallets. Bitcoin address can be changed every time. Nobody would know it&#039;s a SR bitcoin address.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure lots of people disagree on the matter. You&#039;re a first time buyer though, focus on keeping under the trafficable amounts in your area, making sure you get the right postage type, researching your vendors.&nbsp; Bitcoins are fairly straightforward.

				Oh, and I might add. From the two services i&#039;ve used, spendbitcoins are the fastest.&nbsp; Some banks are actually open for a few hours on the weekend. Deposit on saturday, bitcoins will be in your account that day, or before lunch the next day usually.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be set up in no time dude.&nbsp; Plus you feel like a spy. Just don&#039;t get too paranoid standing in the bank line.&nbsp; Have the relevant account numbers open on your phone and just quote them to the teller.&nbsp; <br /><br />All will be good!

				Let us know how it goes dude.&nbsp; There&#039;s really nothing like the feeling of seeing your SR account with bitcoins in it for the first time!<br /><br />Well, except for seeing the best drugs in the world in your letterbox for the first time.<br />Best of luck!

				Hey<br />I deposited the cash and it took 1 hour and 40 mins before it was in my SR account, very happy with the speed and will be using the spendbitcoins service for all my purchases.<br /><br />And yes it was&nbsp; very exciting seeing the coins&nbsp; in my SR account and cannot wait to make a few trial orders to test the waters. I will only be using reputable vendors and buying smaller quantities at first.<br /><br />Thanks for all the help man.<br /><br />Cheers

				https://bitpiggy.herokuapp.com/ is an online option to buy bitcoins in aus. They&#039;re slightly cheaper than spendbitcoins, only catch is that the first 3 or 4 transactions you make are limited to $50, they shut down the site because of receiving stolen funds.
