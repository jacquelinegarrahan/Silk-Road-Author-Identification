				I&#039;m on order 7 after a little more than a month on the road, and I&#039;m starting to wonder if I&#039;m pushing my luck? How many packages have you received? Anyone doing close to 10 purchases a month like I&#039;ve been?

				I have done ten in a week, so only having seven letters in a month is fine.&nbsp; What if those letters or packages were from family or friends would you be concerned?&nbsp; If it is packaged correctly then no one has any idea of whats in them except for you.&nbsp; You might be over thinking the situation since your the only one that knows.&nbsp; But, in the end just do what you feel comfortable with.

				If no package has been seized and you have yet to receive a &quot;love letter&quot; then you are in the clear. You could be ordering off ebay or anywhere else for that matter, it&#039;s not suspicious at all. With christmas right around the corner, most people receive a lot of packages this time of the year as well. You&#039;re in the clear my friend, order as much as you want and be safe.

Hat&#039;s off to you sir. But yeah, there is not really such thing as &quot;too much&quot; as long as your vendors are doing their job well and you aren&#039;t ordering in heavy quantities that will get you more than a love letter.

I guess things are a bit different in Aus. I&#039;m US, I have a lot of close/good friends and family I grew up with.

They can speculate, but being that so many people are out of work, sitting around home wondering why they even bothered going to college, no one seems to mind playing it cool and simply taking money, and pleading the 5th.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good set up if you know how to manage people, and be efficient and assertive with your scheduling. :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Props to you man, that&#039;s amazing and I&#039;m glad it works well for you.

				It would be out of the ordinary if you go from barely getting packages/letters to receiving tons over-night. Idk about other people but ive done absolutely all of my shopping online since 2005(clothing, building equipment, books, nonsense from amazon) on AVERAGE i receive 7 letters/packages a day split between my at home business and my personal self. Keeping a routine is key. Also, creating a front business is a good idea or just getting your post office to think you are an ebay seller and have all your mail sent to you as your ebay name which is alot more common than anyone would think.

				Or if your worried about having to create a believable obvious ebay name then do what 10&#039;s of thousands(probably wayyy more) of people do daily and have the package addressed to an email address(obviously a throw away not connected to you, not tormail or hushmail ect and one that has something to do with ebay or sales@abcompany.com) This is safely acceptable AFTER you have ordered a few legal products and had them sent to this email name OR have just moved into a new location.

				But if an order gets sent to the post office, they want to see a piece of ID with a matching name as the one on the package/letter.
