				well basicallly im new to buying Bitcoins,<br /><br />however Ive&nbsp; played Online Poker&nbsp; for years, and place like Pokerstars (Worth billions of Dollars) allows&nbsp; you to transfer money between players., (The reason they do this is stop people folding money across the poker tables) <br /><br />the sender under no circumstances cannot&nbsp; get there&nbsp; money back once&nbsp; its sent. You can cashout very easily on Stars and you have many many deposit methods all instantly. Cashout usually takes 3 days.<br /><br />It only requires you to trust the BITCOIN seller to send the bitcoins and your not doing anything illegal anyway...<br /><br />Online poker is banned in the USA,&nbsp; and so this option is only for everyone else<br /><br />Thoughts? Pokerstars has over 250,000 players on it sometimes. Often sponser TV programs. You could trust them with $100,000.

				Yea, way too much registration for most people&#039;s comfort levels I would think. I suppose someone purely selling BTC and doing no other vending might do something like that, but I&#039;d doubt it. It is already easy enough with localbitcoins and bit-instant, at least in most Western countries and near larger cities.

				This won&#039;t work. Why mess with a working system? Also, Pokerstars is not worth BILLIONS. No way.

				Why&nbsp; would&nbsp; people use it?...Point is its easy Easy to cashout on Pokerstars, without raising a eyebrow,<br />&nbsp;its not as easy to cashout with Bitcoins it would appear.<br /><br />Pokerstars are &quot;defintily&quot; worth billions, gambling is a bad addiction &quot;they Rake money on 20,000+ tables every second&quot;....<br />They just purchased there Competitor Full Tilt and are paying full tilts debts off for $754 million.<br /><br />
