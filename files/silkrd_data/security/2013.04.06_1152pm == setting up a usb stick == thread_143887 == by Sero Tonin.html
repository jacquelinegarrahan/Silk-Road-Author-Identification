				i just bought an 8gb flashdrive<br />how can i go about setting it up with encryption and everything nice<br />so i can use TOR/PGP through the usb. and not have anything on my computer.<br />i already have truecrypt but am at a loss with it.<br />i searched and couldnt find it on the search engine here.<br />but if there is already a thread about it please link me!<br />thanks

				I like &quot;Tails&quot; found on the Tor.org site. Don&#039;t know much about encrypting the USB also, though. Tails to DVD (burn) then install to flashdrive.

				Haven&#039;t tried tails i use liberte its based on hardened gentoo linux&nbsp; http://dee.su/liberte (clearnet). Very easy to use and set-up extract to your usb and set your computer to boot from usb. On first run it generates an encryption key for you and you set a password, there is an encrypted persistent volume set up for you to save files to.<br /><br />It comes with everything you need(pgp, browser, chat, basic office tools) and all network traffic with the exception of the unsecured browser for accessing public wifi if needed is routed through tor. Make sure you read the short docs http://dee.su/liberte-documentation&nbsp; as there are still some ways you can accidentally compromise security

				Huh?&nbsp; You can&#039;t use full-disk encryption on a Linux installation?&nbsp; Are you absolutely positive about that, because... I don&#039;t believe that everyone I&#039;ve seen say is using full-disk encryption was booting Windows?<br /><br />AES is fine -- any variant above AES-128 probably is too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go trusting your life to that information or anything though; AES is really a family of algorithms, and to my knowledge none are totally broken.&nbsp; AES-128 is getting pretty close to broken though I think.<br /><br />Sero: I mean no offense, I truly don&#039;t, but if you&#039;re having difficulty finding the iso you downloaded... I really don&#039;t recommend trying to use Linux as a primary OS even just for SR.&nbsp; We all have to learn sometime, there&#039;s nothing wrong with that, but if you&#039;re at the stage where finding the iso you downloaded is a problem, you&#039;re going to lose your mind wrestling with Linux.&nbsp; It sounds to me like you downloaded a tarball or something and not the iso, for what it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; &nbsp;An iso is a disc image file, I&#039;m not sure why they&#039;d distribute it along with the Linux equivalent of a zip file -- it wastes bandwidth when people only need one or the other, not both.

				Practically speaking, the strength of your passwords is orders of magnitude more important to protect against people who want to charge you with a crime before you die...<br /><br />Whether you use AES-Twofish-Serpant or Serpant-Twofish-AES, it&#039;s irrelevant if your passwords are password1, password2, and password3. :)<br /><br />The magic numbers are 39 and 44. A 39 character password composed of all printable characters, or a 44 character password composed of numbers and letters, has ~256 bits of entropy. Stronger passwords are unnecessary with these ciphers, because if the attacker knows they are stronger, he will try to brute force the encryption key directly, rather than the password on the key.<br />

				Oh, I didn&#039;t mean those three specific ciphers -- I meant just in general, it actually can make the difference between a secure algorithm and a broken one if you apply them in different orders.&nbsp; That&#039;s all.<br /><br />I&#039;m just a nut who tries to file away in my head every reliable piece of info I come across, and since you&#039;re generally the authority on this stuff I was just making sure anybody like me doesn&#039;t end up thinking it never matters what order you apply such things in.&nbsp; That&#039;s all :)
