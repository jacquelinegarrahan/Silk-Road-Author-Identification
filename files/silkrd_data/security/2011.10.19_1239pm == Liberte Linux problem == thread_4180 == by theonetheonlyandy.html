				Hello all, ive been trying to make my tor usage more anonymous and was looking on the forums and online and found liberte linux. now i d/l the .zip and follow all the instructions for a windows usb. Fat32, the unzipping, put in root, and setup.bat. but when i boot my computer (and yes i set my bios to boot usb) i get a boot error. it literally says BOOT ERROR on the screen. i dont know what to make of it.

				I had the same thing, but got it working o.k....somewhere I read there&#039;s a generic password, if you&#039;re talking about the same thing...maybe it was &#039;liberte&#039; but I don&#039;t remember, but got that one to work, put my own in...next I had problems with the &#039;keyring&#039; password, it was more an irritant than anything else... but I got into keyrings and just deleted it, and then next time, it asked me if I wanted to set up a keyring pswd, and I set my own....<br /><br />It takes some getting used to: I like the persistence, so if I save bookmarks and stuff, it&#039;s all left in the encrypted folder, which is nice, and easy to get to, on the flash drive.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t like the browser, too convoluted for me, but I also was using it on a little netbook, and once I got it on a bigger screened laptop, it seemed to be a lot easier to use, also just on top of a lot more ram and stuff....<br /><br />It&#039;s always between Tails and Privatix and Liberte Linux, and I like&#039;em all for different reasons.&nbsp; Most of my troubles are just a sort of built--in laziness/forgetfulness or something, where I&#039;ll just start using my pc, for pga or keepass, which sort of defeats the purpose...one of the reasons I like Tails is it keeps me honest, I know it&#039;ll all disappear, so I keep an html file stashed in a cloud storage space, like SwissDisk or Wuala, that I can get as soon as I boot....with Liberte or Privatix, I don&#039;t need this...just need to be careful, if I want to keep it to the flash drive I could get rid of in a heartbeat if I needed...
