				My account got flagged by Mt Gox, with 600 USD in it. I kind of want my money backâ€” should I send them fake or real documents to satisfy their &quot;verification procedure?&quot;

				MtGox has done the same thing to you as it has to most other customers ~~ they&#039;re pretending they need to &quot;verify&quot; you because there&#039;s some kind of problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you send them fake ID and they realize it&#039;s fake they may just lock down your account forever.&nbsp; They can do that, they&#039;re in Japan, so you&#039;re probably never going to see them face to face.&nbsp; At this point, just give them what they want ~~ your real ID and whatever other documents they ask for.&nbsp; Eventually you&#039;ll be verified, but they&#039;ll know exactly who you are.&nbsp; So, since your anonymity has been blown just sell your Bitcoins (hopefully at a profit) and use another exchange.&nbsp; Or, very carefully, send your Bitcoins to a few intermediate stops, and maybe use a tumbler, on the way to SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re in a tough spot, but you&#039;ve got too much money invested to just give up.&nbsp;

				I would send real info unless you can buy extremely good fakes.<br />Protip: Get you fakes with a valid address somewhere close that isn&#039;t you, so just in case they have to physically mail you a code on a postcard or something for address verification you can get it. Pick an abandoned house, or PO box with a street name. Typically a private business where you can receive under company and other names, not a PO BOX #&#039;er <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about it. If anybody asks, you&#039;re a bitcoin trader there&#039;s nothing illegal about it. <br />That&#039;s the best part about bitcoin.. almost impossible to determine where they came from. Not like you are using a centralized service like C-Gold or something where they can be contacted and give up account information to see where the funds came from.
