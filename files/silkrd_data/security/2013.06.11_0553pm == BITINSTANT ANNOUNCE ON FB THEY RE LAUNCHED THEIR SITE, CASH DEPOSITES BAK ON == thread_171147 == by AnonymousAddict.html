				I wonder if they block Tor browser from using the website. Also, they may even flag instances where transaction are used through Tor. It says they are licensed money transmitters, so, that means they are in the same category as mtgox. They have to cooperate with the gov&#039;ts requests. Hopefully they stay lax on that.

				Has anyone had a successful transaction through the new bitinstant site? I saw on their twitter that some people were having issues with the site and/or receiving BTC.<br /><br />The site seems to be working fine on my end (using Tor). I was able to setup my buy, but I wanted to make sure people are getting their deposits in a reasonable time before going to Moneygram with cash.

At the location where you paid Moneygram, have they asked for ID in the past? I&#039;m wondering if this is part of a new policy... <br /><br />In my experience, CVS has been hit and miss with asking for ID for a while. It seems to depend on the employee. Some other retail chains have never asked for ID. <br /><br />Has anyone else been able to buy today without ID?

				So I&#039;ve made a cash deposit and received my confirmation email.&nbsp; It&#039;s been over an hour with nothing showing up on blockchain.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at their FAQ&#039;s and it appears a number of people are experiencing the same.&nbsp; However, it seems that the BitInstant team has been plugging away answering questions and reassuring people that the funds will show.<br /><br />I wish I had taken a closer look before I deposited funds as one person in particular is claiming to have deposited a total of $750 four hours ago without it showing on blockchain.&nbsp; This is frustrating and I can understand part of it, but if your &#039;reserves&#039; on different exchanges are empty and you don&#039;t have the btc to send to people, WHY ON EARTH are you taking more orders?!&nbsp; That seems a foolhardy practice and one that vendors here on the market get LIT UP for.&nbsp; Selling more than they currently have, that is.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update the forums when I receive my confirmations.

				I never used Mtgox with bitinstant. I just sent cash straight to my SR wallet (which always changes). I haven&#039;t used them since this weekend, though. I used a different service this weekend. It took an hour or two to get through the blockchain. If bitinstant is all back like before, I bet that would still be quite viable.

				I&#039;ve NEVER used MtGox, thank you very much. ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming that he meant made a cash deposit through zipzap to bitinstant so that bitinstant would send btc to his sr wallet.

				a btc wallet won&#039;t hold cash...<br /><br />You initiate a transaction with BitInstant.&nbsp; Then you deposit cash at a location that places that cash into the account of a company called zipzap.&nbsp; That company then verifies that you deposited the money, then notifies bitinstant.&nbsp; Bitinstant has a lot of bitcoins.&nbsp; Bitinstant sends you the bitcoins that are equivalent to the amount of money you deposited(minus fees).&nbsp; The Bitinstant waits for the funds from zipzap to arrive so they can purchase more btc and start over.<br /><br />It says all of that on the bitinstant page.&nbsp; Try to not be so lazy.

				I&#039;m experiencing a delay also. I used the cash to wallet option, this is only the second time I have used it. The first time I didn&#039;t get what I thought I should have after fees so I stuck to cash to bitstamp for a while but today that option wasn&#039;t there. This is it for me, I have to find a better alternative.

				I&#039;ve heard,&nbsp; With all the current US based exchanges needing to verify identification by sending a bunch of info, they&#039;re actually doing it in a way I&#039;ve never seen or heard of before. After filling out a short registration form, instead of sending them copies of your info they ask 3 multiple choice questions on 3&nbsp; different family members information (Birthdate, age, something of that matter) that&#039;s attached to your name answer all 3 correctly and you&#039;ve been verified. That actually freaked me out a bit as they just goby name, address, and birth date. I&#039;m starting to feel warning signs dealing with them in the future.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would be careful when dealing with bitinstant...Then again, buying coins isn&#039;t illegal. The website seems incomplete and buggy as hell. I would wait or just stop using them all together.<br />

Plenty of sites are excepting bitcoin even on clearnet, so dont trip..<br /><br />I love bitinstant an wont go anywhere else, as long as they dont ever start wanting me to upload my photo ID, which then, a good fake or some one elses is gonna have to due..<br /><br />For those that are new and asked ,NO BITINSTANT DOES not themselves sell the coins, ZIPZAP sends them to your wallet on the BTC to address option.. I cant speak for the rest cause i see no need to jump through hoopes like sending it to MT.GOX THEN TO SR OR ANOTHER WALLET THEN SR.. Just send the money to your SR wallet.. TUMBLES THEN SHOWS!

So, when hundreds or even thousands of more transactions suddenly take place at a given time, the reserves of BTCs they have already traded for run out, so when people go to get &quot;instant&quot; BTCs through say, a moneygram payment, there are quite literally no coins left for Bitinstant to give until they get the ones they are trading for with people&#039;s money from a few days ago.<br /><br /><br />if this is accurate, it sounds to me like why people aren&#039;t getting their coins right away today is because:<br />a) BTC prices are lower than they were a week ago so more people are putting in transactions<br />b) being down for the weekend is probably creating a flood of people trying to buy BTCs<br />c) allowing an increase in transaction limits is wiping reserves<br />d) Bitinstant did a very, very poor job realizing points a)-c) and planning for this. ::)

				I keep getting the error &quot;Amount requested exceeds your per-transaction cash limit!&quot;<br />I&#039;m trying to buy 250 USD worth of BTC. They said that their limit is 500, not sure what&#039;s going on here.<br /><br />Thinking about trying out blue sky traders if bitinstant doesn&#039;t get their shit together by tomorrow.

That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to not reveal personal information when purchasing bitcoins as they can then trace the bitcoins you purchased directly to SR removing plausible deniability. <br /><br />There&#039;s a common misconception that BTC are some magical untraceable currency... this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.
