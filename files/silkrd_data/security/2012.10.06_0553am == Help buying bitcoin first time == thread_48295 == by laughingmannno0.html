				Hi,<br />I am a newbie. Want to try lsd for the first time. Just signed up yesterday. Unfortunately, I live in a third world coutnry but have a US debit card and the only way to buy bit coins seems to be: <br />-by depositing cash at walmart or other places which is not available in my country<br />-by using monegram or western union which is not available in my country<br /><br />I have not found a single method where you can simply buy using the debit card. Also, most places seem to require a phone number where they can call. So, need some advice from the pros here. <br />Thanks<br />

				Western Union has multiple locations in your country, and i believe they even do Western union by phone in Bangladesh but requires your bank accept transactions in USD, if you would like to buy some bitcoins I can sell them to you via Western Union. <br />

				Unfortunately, western union only allows incoming transactions. They dont allow sending money out of the country as far as I know. Only inbound transactions are allowed.&nbsp; My best bet is buying online using debit card where they don&#039;t call any US number for verification. <br />THanks

				Wanted to add, by western union you can only receive money in bangladesh but &quot;not send&quot;. It may be different in other countries because they allow both receiving and sending.<br />Thanks

				nah, your best bet is prolly mailing cash. because no where is going to take your debit card, debit card transactions are processed by visa or mastercard which are subject to charge backs. you buy the bitcoins say your card was stolen, then guess what, your clean and clear with free bitcoins.
