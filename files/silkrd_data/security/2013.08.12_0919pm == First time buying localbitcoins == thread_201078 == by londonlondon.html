				Hi guys,<br />I&#039;ve been scouting around localbitcoins looking at prices fluctuate for a while, but never actually bought any coins.<br />I&#039;m thinking of buying some soon and I was wondering if someone could be so kind to enlighten me on the &#039;typical&#039; procedure when going about purchasing. I will either be doing face to face cash, cash in mail, or bank deposit.<br />Some questions that come to mind:<br />1. Once credited, the coins go into my localbitcoins account? If so, do I then proceed to transfer them from localbitcoins to SilkRoad?<br />2. Is there anything I should try to watch out for? (I&#039;m going with someone with 100+ reviews)<br />3. Anything I should keep in mind?<br />4. If doing it by cash face to face, do I need to bring any &#039;number&#039; with me to give to him/her?<br /><br />Thanks so much to anyone taking your time to read this.<br /><br />May you all be blessed with positive energy and good vibrations =)

				I&#039;ve never done face to face, but here&#039;s a guide i wrote for doing cash deposit at US banks via localbitcoins:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=183277.msg1331285#msg1331285<br /><br />I guess the part about tormail doesn&#039;t apply anymore due to recent events...

				I was just about to post that! :)<br /><br />Stick to cash bank deposit. Whenever btc is on the rise, there are plenty of vendors on LBC that offer this payment method at a reasonable rate. You just enter the amount you want, drive to the bank, fill out the deposit slip with the information provided, pay the teller, then go on LBC and click the button indicating you&#039;ve sent payment. Most of their vendors will release your coins within minutes. Then you navigate to your LBC wallet, enter your destination btc address, and wait for the coins!<br /><br />As long as there are vendors on there offering bank deposit, it&#039;s the easiest and quickest way to get coins outside of reload card --&gt; btc methods (which are all pretty much dead, or will be soon).

From there you should transfer out to your own wallet. And then again to SR. Transferring from LBC directly to SR is kinda lazy and stupid. I would never do it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2. Is there anything I should try to watch out for? (I&#039;m going with someone with 100+ reviews)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No need to go for someone with that much feedback. +5 or more is good enough. Also to state the obvious go for the best price lol. Choose someone you can deal with in person who will take cash off of you. That&#039;s the safest. Build personal relationships. Don&#039;t go through a financial institution or any kind of retail outlet if you can help it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. Anything I should keep in mind?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah. Escrow is only needed if you&#039;re accepting a non-face to face transfer of funds. Otherwise just use the LBC system of funding and releasing transactions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. If doing it by cash face to face, do I need to bring any &#039;number&#039; with me to give to him/her?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope. Just make sure the transaction is already funded before you meetup. That way the release can be done instantly so you don&#039;t have to wait for the 3-6 confirmations needed to transfer to BTC. You&#039;ll receive a text message when the transfer is complete (with a confirmation code you would have received beforehand which you should copy down for your own sake). Or if you&#039;re paranoid about listing your cell in your LBC account you can just look at your account balance after the other guy says the funds have been released. Meet somewhere where there&#039;s Wifi and login to your LBC account directly. Use Tor off of a spoofed hardware address if you&#039;re paranoid about using something other than your own Wifi that way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks so much to anyone taking your time to read this.<br /><br />May you all be blessed with positive energy and good vibrations =)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;:)
