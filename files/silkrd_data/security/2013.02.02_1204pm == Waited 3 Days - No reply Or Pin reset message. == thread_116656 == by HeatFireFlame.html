				Ok so im one of the idiots who forgot their pin, please dont start trolling on it i realise it was a stupid fucking thing to do.<br /><br />waited 3 days for the SR support message after i had 5 incorrect tries and i replied over 9 hours ago and the PIN reset email or whatever never arrived. <br />However at the side where it says freshness it is still marked as unread. Does this mean that Sr support hasn&#039;t had a chance to read it yet?<br />Thanks. Please advise i dont want to send them another message and be a pain in the ass if they just havn&#039;t had a chance to read it. <br /><br />Hff<br />

				That&#039;ll teach you lol - but on the other hand it can be easily done!<br />Did you give the correct email, might be worth checking but strange the reset email never arrived? Otherwise just be patient I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll get back to you - you&#039;re right if it&#039;s unread then that&#039;s what it is.<br />You could always try the new support forums as well you might have some luck there.<br /><br />Very frustrating for you but good luck!

				Still not arrived, Im going to check out the support forums now, But i get the feeling they are way too busy too handle my problem. <br /><br />I received the email to my SR account, But have checked my tormail as well. Nothing. <br /><br />the message that says<br />DO NOT DELETE THIS MESSAGE : PIN RESET<br />when i click read the reply that i sent to SR support to say thats my 3 days up, is saying unread next to it. <br />i also sent them a follow up querie to see what was happening and that is saying unread as well next to it. <br />Does this mean SR support haven&#039;t read the message yet? The process seems simple, It&#039;s just getting it all working that seems impossible
