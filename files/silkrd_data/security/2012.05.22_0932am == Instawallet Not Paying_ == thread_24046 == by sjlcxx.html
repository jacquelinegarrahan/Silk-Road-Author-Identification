				Has anyone else had problems with instawallet lately?<br />I have recently transferred them 19 bitcoins (2 weeks ago) and they still havent put it in my wallet?<br />blockchain.info clearly shows the transaction going into the instawallet account.<br />They have not replied to my several emails in over a week..<br />Any ideas from anyone, help or suggestions?<br />Thanks.

				Timer changed from 20 min to 10 min. I guess it was just clogged or something like you mentioned. That makes me feel better. Thanks :)<br />PS - Sorry for thread jacking. I felt like my problem was very similar.

				Sorry to hear you still have not got your coins sjlcxx, 3 weeks is a long time.<br /><br />Can I ask that if you do ever hear from them and get this resolved you come back and up date this thread so that other users know and can decide whether to use them or not.

				I&#039;ve never had a problem with them.&nbsp; I wonder if thru some incredible fluke, the OP put in another active btc account number, rather than the instawallet one?&nbsp; But not if you&#039;ve traced the blockchain, so I guess that didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Weirdest thing, and I&quot;m sorry it happened.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just keep an eye on any posts saying others have problems with instawallet.&nbsp; I&quot;ve never had to contact them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any time I have bitcoin problems of any kind, I go to https://bitcointalk.org/&nbsp; When I was new on here, I found them invaluable.&nbsp; I learned all I wanted to know about bitcoins, and when I&#039;d have the troubles with TradeHill, and bitinstant, and every other bitcoin tool, they always had people who know what to do about it.&nbsp; So, even tho it does seem hopeless, if you haven&#039;t already, I&quot;d sign on there and see if one of the experts can&#039;t help you a bit...

It just means the 6 confirmations are taking much longer than normal.<br /><br />I have flipped couple hundred coins in the past cuple days without any problems. Sometimes the 6 confirmations have taken 2 hours that just means not many people are doing tranactions so the blocks are taking longer to be created..<br /><br />nothing to worry abotu </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thx for the info im goin to check out https://bitcointalk.org now.<br />Still wont reply to my countless emails.<br />Still no money.<br />However other users are all having no problems so i cant make up my mind about whether or not Instawallet is Trustworthy.<br />On the other hand. They could at least reply to my emails...<br />I&#039;ll report back to let you know if my situation changes.

				Finally Paid :D<br />someone finally replied to my email and apologized for the extremely extended delay.<br />Saying it was an error with the processing somewhere but not sure.<br />Well it proves to me that they are trustworthy but not really the mos relable.<br />I think ill stick with MyBitCoin for now.
