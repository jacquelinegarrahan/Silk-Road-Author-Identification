				So...any suggestions about the best place to buy BTC from in the UK? I can do bank transfers, or I could go into somewhere and exchange cash if needed. I&#039;m aware of the main big ones, was gonna just use Mt Gox but now I hear something about them requiring ID to deposit cash into the account and I dunno...also there may be one I don&#039;t know about with better rates etc?<br />I&#039;m not too concerned with getting them instantly if that helps, can wait a couple days or however long.

				OK I got this super helpful reply in my thread in the newbie playpen, think this may be the way to go&nbsp; :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165892.msg1180707#msg1180707">Quote from: sk0rt on May 30, 2013, 11:04 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Don&#039;t use MtGox - it&#039;s already too big. You should use (if you&#039;re in the UK) a SEPA transfer to your IBAN / SWIFT code. It&#039;s a pan-European no-fees fast transfer method. Oh and I suggest Bitstamp or Intersango.<br /><br />My account was verified within one day, I cashed out bitcoins at $130 each and then did a SEPA transfer to my own bank.<br /><br />Perfect, no fees, goes in as GBP into my account.<br /><br />There&#039;s also Intersango (I think used to be Britcoin?) but they kinda suck. They have little activity so it&#039;s really hard to buy/sell at anything near the current rates and it takes way longer for them to authorize a withdrawal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				intersango doesn&#039;t take GBP anymore, since at least 6 month.<br /><br />Use localbitcoins, find a legit seller, and follow the instructions.<br /><br />Or try to contact btcxuk@tormail.org<br /><br />He is great and 100% legit.<br /><br />I know there are some place to buy some, like private exchange platform, but you&#039;ll need to verify your ID, and it&#039;s def not an open way for anonymous trade ...<br />Most of these place are not reachable with tor or makes you look like a fraud, always using different IP address. <br /><br />Localbitcoins is just fine if you need to buy bitcoin with your bank account.

				I see, well I checked out localbitcoins and there&#039;s a seller on there with 100% positive feedback from 750 transactions...seems pretty legit! He takes normal regular bank transfer, I think there&#039;s some sort of escrow thing too. This may be the way to go when I get the requisite funds...&nbsp; 8)

				What would be ideal, is to find a UK bitcoin seller that accepts<br />UKash 18+ vouchers (available in the UK only).<br /><br />Why is that ideal ?&nbsp; <br />Because you can buy these vouchers anonymously at newsagents.&nbsp; <br />Note: They must be &quot;18+&quot; UKash vouchers.<br /><br />Actually ?&nbsp; Is there such a beast ?&nbsp; <br />An established bitcoin vender that accepts UKash 18+ vouchers ?<br />Please let me know via PM or in this thread. :-)<br />

				Yeah, UKash would be cool I kind of forgot that existed but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve seen adverts for it. I think localbitcoins is the place to start initially, hell my first purchase is gonna be pretty small anyway so I&#039;m not messing with huge amounts and can test out one of the vendors.

				I use localbitcoins.com mostly, wish there was something more official and more trustworthy and not so p2p, but it works, but you do end up paying a bit more than the current BTC price unfortunately.
