				24 hours ago I used BitInstant to send BTC directly to my SR wallet. Less than an hour after I used BitInstant, I received an email from them verifying they had been sent to my SR wallet. I check SR, no money. I wait 6 hours, still no money. I went ahead and checked blockchain and it also says that the BTC have been successfully sent to my SR wallet. Can somebody please tell me WHAT THE FUCK I&#039;m doing wrong? So frustrated. Thank you in advance.<br /><br />JB

				I figured it out I think. My wallet address is a couple months old and apparently I have to have for SR support to get around to it. Ugh, this sucks ass.

				I just had a problem where my email somehow got munged between bitinstant, TrustCash and coinapault. I got all of my verifications right up to Coinapault. I emailed TrustCash and verified that everything was cool there. Then I checked in with Bitinstant, and they showed me the info they had. Once we identified that something had happened to the email address, they contacted Coinapault tech support for me, and the coins were available within an hour or so. Normally The entire transaction from depositing cash and having coins in my SR account is under 2 hours.<br /><br />I have never refreshed my wallet address here, and never had a problem so far. You might want to start with Bitinstant and just follow up the chain to SR.
