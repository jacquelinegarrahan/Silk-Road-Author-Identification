				˙ello. I am new here to the forums, and was looking to buy about a fourth of cannabis online from a West coast seller with 100+ feedback. Before I do so I need to address a few things.<br /><br />I am on the East coast, the product is on the west coast. Is it bad practice to order something from the other end of the United States given all the processing it might go through? <br /><br />I recently moved out of my apartment, and it is now vacant, am I better off sending the package there?<br /><br />What are the advantages of having a postal box to ship to, and if I do not sign for a package and they have no proof of me opening it can they still bust me, or would they have to get a warrent to search?<br /><br />What are the penalties of getting under an ounce shipped to a home, and being busted?<br /><br />Thanks, <br />Monster

				People routinely order internationally here. As long as the address isn&#039;t suspicious, and your vendor is professional with the packaging and sealing, you should be in the clear.<br /><br />Shipping to a vacant apartment is a tipoff to the postal service, as detailed in posts about secure shipping... read the stickied posts in the Shipping forum:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18904.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19010.0<br /><br />In the US at least, you can&#039;t get arrested for somebody else shipping drugs to your house, if you don&#039;t touch them yourself. So wait a while before opening the package, and do so in a different location from the one where it arrived.<br /><br />(Edited to fix the links)
