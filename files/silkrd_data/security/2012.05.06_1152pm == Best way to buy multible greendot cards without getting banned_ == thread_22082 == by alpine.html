				I am looking to buy multiple greendot pre paid debt cards to load moneypaks. I know that they don&#039;t allow mutlible cards and will ban you if found, so I am wondering what&#039;s the best way to do it? I know online they want a SSN so that most Likely would not work unless I had more than one. <br /><br />Thanks a ton, alpine

				Greendot issues prepaid debit cards for different people who provide prepaid debit cards. <br />Dont just go through greendot<br />you can reload <br />turboxtax card<br />walmart card<br />accountnow card <br />go through the people who issue greendot cards and they will be loadable wit mp.<br />Do the research on the company&#039;s im sure you will be fine to launder that money. <br />Hope this helps!

				Look up serve.com, it&#039;s American Expresses take on paypal, they will mail you a debit card thing and you can hook it up to your bank account, then you can load greendot moneypaks straight onto it and transfer it to your bank if you wish. Kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get used to it it&#039;s better than paypal.

				Thanks for the help I looked at the different cards and serve, so does serve have limits to how many moneypaks I can add? Basically I just want to add the moneypak then cash it out at a ATM. Also I looked at The turbotax card and it says it has a $2500 dollar daily limit, so does that mean I can use unlimited moneypak a day as long as it does not go over $2500? Thanks, alpine

				I am really trying to figure this whole thing out its confusing as hell. So I need a way to accept a lot of moneypaks daily And serve and everything else seems to have limits on how many paks I can cash. Basically I just want to take the moneypak put it onto a debit card and cash it out at the ATM. From what I gather would the only way to expand my limits be to buy multible cards from different companies? So have a few turbo cards a few Walmart cards? Any help would be great I know there&#039;s people out there that accept a shit load of moneypaks so there must be a way to get past the limits. Anyone have experence with this?
