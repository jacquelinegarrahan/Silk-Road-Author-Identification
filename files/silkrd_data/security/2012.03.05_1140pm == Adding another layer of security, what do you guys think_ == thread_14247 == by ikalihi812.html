				How about if we use LogMeIN software or an alternative to use another person&#039;s PC in conjunction with TOR to access SR?<br /><br />Even if the IP address used with SR is tracked via some unknown means, it won&#039;t lead directly to your own PC.<br /><br /><br />TeamViewer is a great free option

				I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s the case, but there are dozens of threads in here that all say the same thing, don&#039;t use a VPN in conjuction with TOR for SR purposes. Haven&#039;t seen a single thread supporting the idea so maybe just search around in here and you&#039;ll arrive at the same conclusion.

As you point out the remailer<br />networks are pretty much dead.<br /><br />You can sign up to Tor Mail and FastMail via Tor, and then access both<br />either through a web interface or via IMAP (Claws Mail works well as a<br />lightweight IMAP client, and seems to play nicely with Tor). FastMail<br />requires a pre-existing email address for its free account, but 10<br />Minute Mail (or Tor Mail) can help you there.<br /><br />http://tormail.net/ , http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br />https://fastmail.fm/<br />http://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html<br /><br />Search the archives for some discussions about Tor Mail ... not<br />everyone is happy with it.

But<br />&gt; again, you have no way, as a user, to really know how anonymous you are.<br /><br />So, in essence VPNs in this context, are just another form of proxy server (or<br />another way to access one).&nbsp; I agree, there is no way to even know if you are<br />anonymous - after all, I am sure that some VPNs are run by governments (not<br />that they&#039;d tell you that).<br /><br />&gt; As a user, for both Tor and VPNs, it comes down to trust. Tor is arguably<br />&gt; more likely to be more anonymous. Accessing Tor through VPNs can&#039;t hurt.<br />&gt; Routing VPNs through Tor may be appropriate under some circumstances. But<br />&gt; doing that will create shared history for each VPN that you use in that way.<br />&gt; You obviously don&#039;t want to use the same VPN service on both sides of Tor.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t everything come down to trust, in the end?&nbsp; Everything going through<br />the Internet is logged, and unless encrypted, world-readable.&nbsp; Often, it is<br />logged, even then in unencrypted form, on the other side.<br /><br />What I get from this discussion is that, with anything that makes you<br />anonymous, you can&#039;t be sure of the level (I couldn&#039;t even if I did go through<br />the Tor source code, since I have no way of knowing if every Tor node my<br />traffic passes through is using *that* source code).&nbsp; It is a matter of trust,<br />best practices, and the integrity of the system you&#039;re using.<br /><br />&gt; If you&#039;re interested in learning more, there are many informative threads on<br />&gt; Wilders Security Forums. <br /><br />I will probably check them out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If anyone SUGGESTS a specific VPN to you, they are probably a fed. If anyone suggests you should use a VPN instead of Tor they are probably a fed.
