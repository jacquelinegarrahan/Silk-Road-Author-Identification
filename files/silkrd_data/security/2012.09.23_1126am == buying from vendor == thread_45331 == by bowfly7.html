				If you are all read and ready to make a purchase&nbsp; then thru the transaction/purchase there will be a communication box to allow you to insert a message &amp; your encrypted address. If you already have the vendor key imported just have it it encrypt what you want to send. hope this helps

You&#039;ll need to remember your PIN, but other than that looks good.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be able to see the status of your shipment on the orders section.

I suggest you also read up on purchasing and check out your selected vendor on the forums before your first purchase. Unfortunately there are some scams out there so it pays to do your homework thoroughly and read the vendor feedback on your vendors profile. <br />READ READ READ.....its all in the forums but here you go!<br /><br />Assuming you already have a bitcoin wallet on your computer, all you need to do is go to bitinstant.com&nbsp; You can buy bitcoins directly from them and they will transfer the coins to the address you specify (your bitcoin wallet).<br />You will be given information to pay via moneygram. You then will be able to choose from a list of locations near you such as walmart as well as many other locations. <br />Go to the location you choose, fill out the moneygram slip with the provided information pay the clerk and you will have the bitcoins very quickly. I am 5 miles from a location I used recently. By the time I got home (15 minutes tops) my coins were in my wallet. Very simple step by step process once you are in the bitinstant website. <br />It makes life easier if you have your wallet open and that it is at the current block. You will see that on the bottom of your wallet&nbsp; is updating blocks. If it has been a week or so since you last opened your wallet this may take several hours to update. If it is the first time you open your wallet after loading the software this process takes many hours. Once the blocks are current your coins will appear in your wallet. Now you can transfer your BTC to SR. The transfer to SR may take a couple hours. This is due to the encryption utilized by Tor and Silk Road. The price you pay for safety and anonymity.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;d never dream of purchasing BTC on SR but thats just my sentiments for what its worth.<br />If there is any of this you don&#039;t understand I suggest once again READ READ READ....all of the pertinent information is in the forums!! I suggest you read up regardless.<br />Hope that helps and Good Luck!!
