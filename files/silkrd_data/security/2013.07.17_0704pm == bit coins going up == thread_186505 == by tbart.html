				got a feeling stories like this one are going to push bitcoins more mainstream and push prices up<br />should i be hocking the farm and investing everything in BTC and hope the feds don&#039;t crack down on it and destroy it&#039;s attraction?<br /><br /><br />http://cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/craig-bannister/govt-bureau-creating-google-earth-every-financial-transaction-senator<br /><br />Gov&#039;t Bureau &#039;Creating a Google Earth on Every Financial Transaction,&#039; Senator Warns<br />July 16, 2013 - 4:18 PM <br />________________________________________&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking to create a &quot;Google Earth&quot; of every financial transaction of every American, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY) warned today in a Senate speech opposing confirmation of Richard Cordray as CFPB director.<br />&quot;This bill (creating the CFPB) was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street. Instead, it&#039;s creating a Google Earth on every financial transaction. That&#039;s right: the government will be able to see every detail of your finances. Your permission - not needed,&quot; Sen. Enzi said.<br />&quot;They can look right down to the tiny details of the time and place where you pulled cash out of an ATM,&quot; Enzi warned.<br />And, there&#039;s nothing you can do about, since Americans don&#039;t have the ability to &quot;opt out&quot; or prohibit the government from collecting their personal financial data, Enzi said:<br />&quot;You can&#039;t tell &#039;em to stay out of your records. It&#039;s not possible. If your data is being collected, you do not have the option to opt out. Nor, does the CFPD need any kind of permission from you to gather your personal information.&quot;<br />Enzi called for greater congressional oversight authority to ensure the CFPB does not abuse its power, but Republican still dropped plans to filibuster the nomination, caving to threats by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to change the filibuster rules.<br /><br /><br />

				Your guess is as good as mine.&nbsp; If I had to speculate I&#039;d say we&#039;re going to see a short term decline in bitcoin before we see a rebound taking us to $120 and $150 and beyond.&nbsp; This past week bitcoin really has had trouble surpassing the $100 wall.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to a great forum (clear net link below) where all guys do is speculate on where they think bitcoin is headed:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0<br /><br />There are just as many people who think it&#039;ll go down and crash and burn as there are people who think it&#039;ll skyrocket into the thousands of dollars.&nbsp; These are long term speculations.&nbsp; You can just about bet in the the short term bitcoin will rise and fall.&nbsp; It&#039;s the nature of bitcoin.&nbsp; It goes up and it goes down.&nbsp; It&#039;s just tough to predict if it&#039;s going to go up next or go down next.&nbsp; It&#039;s gambling really.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the stock market.&nbsp; There are major whales with millions of dollars invested in bitcoin that trade thousands of coins at a time and they can manipulate the market so to speak.&nbsp; Pump and dump strategy if you will.&nbsp; They make thousands and the little guy loses their ass.&nbsp; But yeah check out that site.&nbsp; A lot of guys use terms that I don&#039;t understand yet.&nbsp; I used one above in my speculation: a wall.&nbsp; A lot of technical jargon and graphs to analyze.&nbsp;

				well, i&#039;m just talking about pressure on bitcoins growing from mainstream consumers that don&#039;t like having their every movement &quot;mapped&quot;. There&#039;s another story in the news about license plate scanners recording cars as they pass and taking pictures and storing that info indefinitely - one guy in san diego filed a FOIA request for any license scan info on him, and in 11 months he&#039;d been photographed 37 times, including one time in his driveway with his two daughters getting out of his car (cops have the scanners mounted on their cars now)<br /><br />

				forgot which, but think it was the kippinger newsletter, there was an article about &quot;fiat&quot; currency, and this next part i&#039;ve had a helluva time wrapping my brain around, but one thing that gives fiat money value is the fact the gov&#039;t TAKES SOME BACK BY TAXING IT!!<br /><br />but suspect you&#039;re right about digital currency, would save a lot of printing (whether credit cards, paper currency etc) - don&#039;t know about the sheeple accepting implants but probably on their smartphones&nbsp; - but if/when digitcal currency becomes the standardd, bitcoins and anyone possessed will be criminalized -

				I disagree that the reason the feds would limit access to BTC is because it can be used to buy illegal things. $ bills are used to buy many, many more illegal things than BTC are. Like you said about all regular currency becoming electronic. I just think the reasons for both are pure control, not to keep us safe from people buying illegal things. They want to have their hand/eyes in/on EVERY little piece of your life.

				agree with both positions / perspectives but the feds will be trying to stamp btc out for another reason: their lack of ability to control it&#039;s movement. Years ago, the firearms company i worked with did some business with the Jordanians - they wanted to pay us in swiss francs or wanted us to open an acct at their bank (the one they owned) in switzerland so they could pay us thru that acct. When we asked why, their response was that US State Dept requires (and had obtained agreement on this by international treaty) every transaction in excess of $10,000 has to be reported to US State. They felt it was none of State&#039;s business - unfortunately, the export license for the product was going to have to be approved by State Dept, so they&#039;d know, no matter what currency the transaction was in, or what bank it was conducted thru.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about control

				If they mixed their data on IP addresses to data stored publically on the blockchain they could easily find most end-users.<br /><br />Bitcoin is hardly an anonymous currency, why do people treat it like it is?
