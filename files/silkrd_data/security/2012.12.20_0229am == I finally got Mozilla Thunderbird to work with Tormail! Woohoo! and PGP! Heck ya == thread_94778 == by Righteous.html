				as a new seller, i was told that i should be using PGP. i thought that i was going to need to set it up with a client-side e-mal application (but later was informed that that&#039;s not required) so i spent hours trying to get Mozilla Thunderbird working with Tormail, but the dern thing just wouldn&#039;t work. i was pissed. so i search the SR forums and found thread where a couple of folks had the same problem and there was no responses, and as i was trying to post my story of frustration i got the bright idea to just go into the Tor Browser network settings and see what they are set to, and there was the solution to my problem. long story short, the Help section on Tormail&#039;s page is outdated, so here&#039;s a new tutorial that works for me with Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-1 and Mozilla Firefox 17.0. Comments, corrections, and criticism is welcome.<br /><br />Configure Thunderbird to work through Tor<br /><br />You can use Tor Mail with Mozilla Thunderbird by following these instructions.<br />You must do this or it will not work with Tor Mail. <br /><br />1. Download and Install Thunderbird.<br />2. Open Thunderbird.<br />3. Goto Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced Icon -&gt; General Tab<br />4. Click Config Editor button.<br />5. In the config editor filter type in network.proxy.socks_remote_dns<br />6. Double click on it to change the value to true. (See Image #1 below)<br />7. Close the Config Editor and click Network &amp; Disk Space tab.<br />8. Click Settings Button.<br />9. Select Manual Proxy Configuration and fill in the following. (See Image #2 below)<br />Socks Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 9050<br />10. Select SOCKS 5.<br />11. Press OK.<br />12. Press OK again on the options window to close it.<br /><br />Image #1<br />Config Editor<br />(http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/8ec4f9fd85018b238f8c0d622d18c676.png)<br /><br />Image #2<br />Proxy Config<br />(http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/dfb9e3d8ce78a8aeca999d54fa5d3e85.jpg)<br /><br />Adding your Tor Mail account to Thunderbird<br /><br />1. Open Thunderbird.<br />2. Goto Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Add Mail Account.<br />3. Enter your name (whatever you want to be displayed, its not your username), email address and password.<br />Thunderbird does not download any autoconfig file, so click the Manual Config button and use the following:<br />IMAP server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 143 SSL: None Authentication: Normal Password<br />SMTP server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 25 SSL: None Authentication: Normal Password<br />POP3 server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 110 SSL: None Authentication: Normal Password<br /><br />IMAP stores your mail on the server similar to webmail.<br />POP3 downloads the messages to your PC (and usually deletes them from the server after download).<br />If you want to access your mail from multiple PC&#039;s then IMAP is the best choice.<br />POP3 may be problematic with Tor because of long delay connecting and Thunderbird only tries every hour, meaning it may actually never make a successful connection.<br /><br />Image #3<br />Add Mail Account <br />(http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/eff0ca6a51b050fbbb0545c59305bb31.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Then you can go to http://www.gpg4win.org/ and download Gpg4win.<br />Follow the instructions to set up your PGP stuff.<br />Add the Enigmail plug-in to Thunderbird and you&#039;re all set!<br />&nbsp;<br />Now when folks give you their PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK just copy it to the clipboard, right-click on the red Kleopatra icon that&#039;s now in your system tray, go to Clipboard -- Certificate Import and now you&#039;ll be able to send encrypted messages to that recipient.<br /><br />To send and recieve PGP encrypted messages in the Silk Road messaging just make use of Kloepatra&#039;s tray icon to Encrypt or Decrypt the clipboard contents.<br /><br />Image #4<br />Kleopatra Tray Icon<br />(http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/8e8034de0f5ba46beccf53d7fed13d58.jpg)<br /><br />If this helped you the please post a comment!

				FYI, there&#039;s an extension called Torbirdy that secures Thunderbird in the same way that Torbutton secures Firefox.<br /><br />https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/

				Followed the updated instructions and everything worked perfect for me. Initially I was having problems with my outgoing server, but realized I needed to change the port to 25 (which is stated in the directions above), and that solved the problem. Thanks for posting, very much appreciated.

				In order to be truly anonymous, using a Tormail account is a definite must. Congratulations for getting it working my friend.
