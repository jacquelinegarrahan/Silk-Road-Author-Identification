				I&#039;m wondering if the anonymous PO Box/private mailbox is an option for non-illicit mail. Mail that, if it was on a USPS/UPS database having you as the receiver, could be used to justify an investigation or further an active one. Obviously your mail is a great way for the federal government to figure out your habits, hobbies, interests, etc. Simply check the database under your first or last name, or your address, and see what we can find! It&#039;s easy, and I know they do it, especially if nothing else seems to be going well. It&#039;s probably as simple as a google search on their end, so why not add an extra layer of security? Why should they be able to keep a log of the sending and receiving party of every piece of mail that&#039;s ever come? And yes, you&#039;re right, this doesn&#039;t go for stamped mail, but what reputable company nowadays does not use tracking? This is my point - everything you&#039;ve legally sent and received with tracking (no matter what the carrier) is readily available to &quot;them&quot; at a moment&#039;s notice. Just by the company name (on the return address on the database), they can usually deduce the genre of what you bought, and then they just go to the company and request the info (which they will get, one way or another, and it&#039;s not like most companies are difficult when it comes to LE requesting info). I want to delete this aspect of dealing with reputable mail order companies. It&#039;s really hard to believe that there is no way of receiving things anonymously just for people who don&#039;t want to be spied on. But I&#039;m wondering if false identification at a POB/PM is an option. Usually, when addressing false ID to open one of these, people go right to the &quot;seized package&quot; argument. &quot;Well, if you get a package seized and they start looking into you...&quot; etc. That is not a factor here, which is why I&#039;m asking the question. Everything sent to the box would be perfectly legal; nothing would ever be seized. The only illegal portion of this would be the false identification, which is still a very serious crime (mail fraud). I am just wondering, though, if it is doable to open a box with false identification, additionally, whether or not it is possible that, after the box was successfully opened, something could go wrong (given that everything being ordered is perfectly legal).<br /><br />Please, no answers from individuals who are inexperienced in this matter. I preferably would like answers from those who have actually opened a box themselves with false info or who can testify accurately on behalf of someone who has. Thank you for your consideration.
