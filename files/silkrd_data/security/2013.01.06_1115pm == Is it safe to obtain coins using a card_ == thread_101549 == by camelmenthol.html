				Many people suggest using an anonymous cash deposit to obtain bitcoins, however this is becoming a more and more problematic option to me. For my path on the silkroad, my only intention is to obtain small amounts items for personal use only, if that means anything. I was considering using http://blockchain.info to send the coins anonymously to a wallet I access behind my vpn and tor, and then through a few more wallets before they finally reach my silkroad wallet. I am not looking for a back patting, nor am I looking for someone to tell me that nothing is 100% safe (not even a cash deposit is 100% safe). I&#039;m looking for someone to tell me realistically if this is okay or not, and if anybody you know (or you!) does this to obtain bitcoins.

				We&#039;re all taking a risk being here and using SR, it all depends on how much of a risk you&#039;re willing to take to obtain your drugs. It&#039;s obviously not &#039;safe&#039; to use a card because from what I&#039;ve heard just shifting your coins through a few wallets won&#039;t shake off a trace back to you. After all if this method worked perfectly well then we&#039;d all be using our bankcards. <br /><br />The question is why is an anonymous deposit problematic? What country do you live in?&nbsp;

				The safety aspects of purchasing bicoins with a credit card is something you will never have to consider. <br /><br />The reason you will never have to consider it is that no one will sell you bitcoins in a credit card transaction. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, but credit card transactions can be reversed. Since no one will sell you bitcoins using your credit card, you don&#039;t have to worry about the safety of that.
