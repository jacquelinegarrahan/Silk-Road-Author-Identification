				Wallet Address<br /><br />You can generate any number of addresses (public keys) for a wallet and any previous address matching a wallet can be used for that wallet. Every time you make a transaction into your SR wallet, a new wallet address will be generated. This is done so that no correlation between your wallet and address can be made. An address is 33 characters long and always starts with a &quot;3&quot; or a &quot;1&quot;. <br /><br />This is from http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Bitcoin<br /><br />I think you will be fine.

				Old addresses can still be used to transfer bitcoins to your SR account.<br /><br />My question is, how long will an old address last?<br /><br />I&#039;ve always changed address prior to transferring bitcions to my account, so there are some old addresses from 2011.&nbsp; <br /><br />If someone transfers to one of those old addresses, will it show up in my SR account?<br />
