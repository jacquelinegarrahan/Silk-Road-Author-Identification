				Blockchain.info has a mixer.<br /><br />It is on the clearnet.<br /><br />Charges 1%<br /><br />used it quite a few times myself without any issues.<br /><br />Quick and they have a taint analysis tool so you can check how anonymous your coins really are.

				I think a problem with the blockchain mixer is that a single transaction goes in, a single transaction goes out - and it happens immediately. Although the coins are different, I&#039;m a bit concerned it&#039;d be possible to correlate the two incoming/outgoing transactions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used bitlaundry, but it&#039;s a bit expensive (5% plus a fee for each outgoing transaction). Allows multiple outgoing transactions at random times. I did a taint analysis on one of the mixes, and it came out fine - it was a small amount though.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think any of these services are trustworthy, and wouldn&#039;t put any more bitcoins into one at once than I&#039;d be happy to lose.

				Blockchain pays out in 2 or 3 unequal chunks, from different addresses, making tracking more difficult.

				Also payouts are delayed, anywjere between 15mins and 90 mins in my experience.

				You might be right, I didn&#039;t investigate deeply - I think the delay is due to there not being enough coins in the mix though. Anyway, I still think the amounts going in/coming out in a short time frame could pose some risk, albeit slight. But, it&#039;s cheap relative to alternative options and they say they guarantee untaited coins (which at least bitlaundry doesn&#039;t) - so it seems well worth including in a cleaning protocol.

				my concern with bitcoinfog is that it is probably used by most SR users so any coins that come out of it have probably been linked to SR fairly recently.
