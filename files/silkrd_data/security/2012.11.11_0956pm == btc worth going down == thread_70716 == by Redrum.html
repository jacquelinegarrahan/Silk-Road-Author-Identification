				I have a lot of coins tied up in sr too but starting threads like this and clogging up the board will accomplish nothing. <br />So, what if dpr did run off with all of our coins, what we going to do about it? Not a damn thing because we can&#039;t.<br />Admins already left a message and stickied it, dpr is supposed to be giving us a update soon, your bitching is doing nothing.<br /><br />

				Average people, which have no real-life experience with the subtleties of the drug game, are coming to SR and treating this place like an Amazon transaction. The forums over the last few days resemble an alleyway of addicts waiting hopelessly outside the door of their dealer, fretting about their next fix.

				I have several sites - none as complex as SR or as large but things do go wrong and have for me many times. I learn to backup sites &amp; change servers when I get grassed.&nbsp; Cars break down, hard drives go bang, things break. You&#039;re shouting at the wind - sh&amp;t happens in life. I also sell via my own sites too - eggs in one basket - never a good thing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp; My business that makes me 1000$ a week(modest estimate)&nbsp; is ceased because of it but you don&#039;t hear me complaining. People really take for granted the service that this place provides. I would never be able to find awesome drugs like mdma without this place and i am eternally grateful. Even if all my money that&#039;s tied up in SR dissapears i would still be extremely grateful. so how about you CHILL. it isnt your right to be here, its a privilege that could be taken away any time! DPR will work this out. just give it time and continue to offer support to our community.

				Anyone bitching about BTC price fluctuations obviously hasn&#039;t been working with them very long. At one point they were worth more than $18 a piece. Then the bottom fell out and they went to around $4 each very very quickly. So bitching about a fluctuation of less than a dollar over the course of a few days is a wasted and fruitless effort.&nbsp; You&#039;ll regain your few pennies you feel butthurt over easily once SR is back up and the exchanges get their usual BTC demand back.
