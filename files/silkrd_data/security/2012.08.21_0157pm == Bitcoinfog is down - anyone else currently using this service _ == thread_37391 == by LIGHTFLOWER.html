				So I have some bitcoin in an account with Bitcoinfog.com . They&#039;ve been down since yesterday. I&#039;ve been waiting... starting to lose my patience though.<br /><br />Does anyone ACTUALLY use this?

				I have a substantial amount of coins sat in a BitcoinFog account, their freeweb page is up and running so hopefully this is a .tor server issue. <br /><br />*Fingers crossed*

				Yup, there was another thread that got started, it appears at least several of us used Bitcoin Fog. I doubt I has as much in there are some other folks, but it wasn&#039;t an insignificant amount.<br /><br />It is too soon to say they&#039;ve vanished for sure, but things don&#039;t look good to me. Their clear-net site claims they&#039;ll post updates and outage info to Twitter, but they haven&#039;t made a comment in any venue about this. If it were a couple of hours I might not expect an update, but to go more than 24 hours and not even acknowledge there is a problem stinks to me. The longer we don&#039;t hear anything, the more likely we never will.<br /><br />Even if they do get things back up, will people want to trust them with funds in the future?

				It&#039;s back up and I&#039;m withdrawing all of my coins right away. These guys will not see any future business from me.

				Bitcoin Fog IS back online however the balance on one of my accounts is&nbsp; 50BTC down from its original balance when i was able to log in 3 days ago. I have messaged their admin and am waiting on a response however I have withdrawn funds from most of my accounts with them and will unlikely be using their service again unless this can be resolved.<br /><br />I will keep you informed!
