				I just wanted to let everyone here know about bitcoin armory. I&#039;ve been beta testing for a while now, helping the main dev alan work out all the bugs.<br /><br /><br />heres some copypasta from his site:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Armory is an open-source, python-based, wallet-managment platform for the Bitcoin network.&nbsp; It was designed from the ground up to provide countless innovative features not available in any other Bitcoin program.&nbsp; No other program can claim to even have half of the functionality available here – Armory is light-years ahead of any other Bitcoin client out there.&nbsp; <br />And most importantly, Armory is open-source so it’s available for free.&nbsp; Armory is licensed under the AGPL version 3, which guarantees that any derivative programs based on Armory source-code must also be open-source.&nbsp; That means users win!<br /><br />You can use Armory for all of your Bitcoin needs.&nbsp; It allows you to maintain multiple wallets, with or without encryption.&nbsp; Maintain offline wallets for 100% security from online attackers.&nbsp; Import addresses created with VanityGen or sweep funds from Casascius physical Bitcoins.&nbsp; Toggle between “Standard” and “Advanced” modes to guarantee an appropriate set of options and information.&nbsp; And all this is available through an intuitive user interface that brings all the most advanced features of Bitcoin to your computer, without needing to be an uber-geek!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although the Bitcoin network is good at securely transferring money, it is the users’ responsibility to protect their own digital wallets, usually stored on their own computer.&nbsp; Never has personal computer security been so important, yet very few applications exist which provide such high levels of security and usability at the same time.<br /><br />Armory enables users store their Bitcoins with the highest degree of security, previously only available to those with programming experience and a technical understanding of Bitcoin.&nbsp; Armory is tailored to both newcomers and advanced users, reducing or expanding the functionality based on the selected user-mode: “Standard,” “Advanced,” or “Developer.”&nbsp; &nbsp;It gives beginners a simple intuitive interface, while optionally providing all the features desired by advanced users and developers.<br /><br />Armory also provides a new level of convenience to companies that wish to adopt Bitcoin in their business.&nbsp; Business owners will be able to handle all aspects of Bitcoin without hiring specialized staff.&nbsp; The developers of Armory believe that business-level adoption of Bitcoin will lead to its overall success.<br /><br />Bitcoin has the potential to change the world, and Armory helps enable Bitcoin to live up to that potential.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />It has many neat features.
