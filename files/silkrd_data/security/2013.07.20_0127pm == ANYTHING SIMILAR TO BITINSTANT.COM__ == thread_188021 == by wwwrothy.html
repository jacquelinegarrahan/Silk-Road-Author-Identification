Right now, they are workingon the site and since bitfloor is down, i need a way to turn my cash to coins. Lots of nice medical strains i need to buy. <br /><br />NOW, anyone, know a way I can do this here? I mean shit....or even a vendor that can send me some free medicinal samples in the meantime :-)<br /><br />Hit me back guys, I need to buy my new shipment!<br /><br />THX<br /><br />Roth

				If you can wait 3-5, I&#039;d suggest doing a wire transfer on bitstamp.net.<br /><br />the exchange rate is several dollars under gox (@ ~86.xx) and even more under SR average. <br /><br />You can literally get more than what you paid by the time you transfer them to SR. <br /><br />Something to look into, otherwise theres a thread on here somewhere about various places to buy bitcoins.

				Coinbase - Only drawback is they seam to fuck people over, you have to go through a verification period but after that you get bitcoins at trading price (plus a little fee) instantly.<br /><br />Virwox - Once again you have to go through a waiting period<br /><br />BTCquick - My personal preference, you go through a verification period but their limits while in the verification are very reasonable.
