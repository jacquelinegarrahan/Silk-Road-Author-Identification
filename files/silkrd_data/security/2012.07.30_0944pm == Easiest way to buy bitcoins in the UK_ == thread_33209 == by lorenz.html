				Hi I&#039;m new here. I want to get some bitcoins into my account (I&#039;m in the UK) so I can make a purchase. But I&#039;m confused as to how to go about it. I had a look at Intersango&#039;s and MtGox&#039;s website and I&#039;m lost, it looks complicted. <br /><br />What&#039;s the easiest and quickest way to buy bitcoins? And how do I get the bicoins at a good exhange rate? I&#039;m willing to trade some anonimity for convenience.<br /><br />Does anyone else here use a different site for UK that they find better or faster than the two mentioned above?

				Intersango are having some problems at the moment. Don&#039;t send them any money, at least not for the time being.<br /><br />A chap called vlad1m1r will be along soon with some advice. Keep checking the thread, he usually doesn&#039;t take long!

				hi all&nbsp; :)<br /><br />i&#039;m in exactly the same boat as the OP - found this place through my current hook-ups in the RC/online pharms scene, but am a bit confused as to how to actually make a purchase!&nbsp; i&#039;ll have a good look round, and figure it out in the end i&#039;m sure, but if someone could point me in the direction of a &quot;best practices&quot; guide or whatever, that would be a big help&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />thanks!<br />

				im new too, I wish someone would have told me what im about to say to you.<br /><br />open a gt.gox account but don&#039;t verify it with ID.&nbsp; you can still do a bank transfer from your UK bank to mt.gox UK bank.<br /><br />it will take 2-3 days for this transfer to happen. <br /><br />Once its done, mt. gox will email you instantly.<br /><br />Then buy bitcoins for GBP, thats fairly straight forward just follow the instructions.&nbsp; trade at whatever it says. its goin up at the moment anyway, you cant go wrong.<br /><br />I found it difficult to work out how to transfer the actual bitcoins out of the account. maybe im a dumb ass but you must....<br />trade tab / funding options / withdraw funds / bitcoins<br /><br />I coundnt get my bitcoins from gt gox to SR account wallet today and I know others are the same.<br /><br />The quickest way to create a personal online bitcoin wallet is with the basic service from instawallet. <br />I succeeded by sending my bitcoins from mt gox to instawallet (20min) and then SR account(3 hours).&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck guys,<br /><br />Also I dont think that PGP encrypted messages are essential because SR will encrypt your address upon order and delete it once the seller has it.<br />But dont hold me to this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone correct me if im wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If you live in the UK use Vlad1m1r<br /><br />He does a cash in post service which is next day, it&#039;s the only method that&#039;s completely anonymous, and definitely the easiest and probably the fastest at the moment. He&#039;s had hundreds of happy customers and is a good guy. Used him myself for financial services.

				Hi guys, <br /><br />placed an order with Vlad, but haven&#039;t had any comms back yet. I lazily didn&#039;t encrypt the message, could that be a problem?<br /><br />Or do i need to just be a bit more patient?<br /><br />Cheers

				yeah ive been using Intersango for about 5 months now and never had any issues but they are locked down at mo so Im going with MtGox, Vlad seems straight up but as I only buy only £300 worth of coins at most, I will roll with MtGox over him only due to the fees of 10%. Still, it is more anonymous using his cash in post service. You should be good with either service....Welcome to the road new guys!! It&#039;s the bollocks!!&nbsp; 8) :)<br /><br />Oh and I&#039;d always use PGP encryption when putting ya order of BTC/address in the box when ordering!!! Standard!!!

				Many thanks to all for your kind words.<br /><br />Rest assured I am burning through all your orders and they will be processed on the same day they&#039;re made (if rather late at night!)&nbsp; - I took this week off work to make sure there aren&#039;t any backlogs, so things are ticking over very nicely at the moment, many thanks to you all for your patience.<br /><br />V.
