				Keep on waiting. It cane take anywhere from 30 seconds to 24+ hours for a withdrawal to &quot;hit the network&quot; and be broadcast to bitcoin nodes.

				It just hit, i finally did something right. Being as it was only a trial i sent it direct from this very new account. Should i use a bunch of tumblers first in the future? If so, are there any free ones that dont take 1-3%? if so, id like to practice to make sure i know what im doing.

				The coins in your SR account don&#039;t exist in the block chain. They are kept in a separate database that SR manages.<br /><br />When you submit a withdrawal, it can take a few hours to process. That&#039;s different from the bitcoin network / block chain, where a transaction shows up across the network within seconds.<br /><br />You submitted a withdrawal and a few hours later the coins showed up, so everything went as planned. :)<br /><br />Well, almost everything. Keep in mind that, although the SR interface allows you to translate bitcoins into American dollars for convenience, you don&#039;t have dollars in your account. You have bitcoins. So when you withdraw X amount, that&#039;s BTC, not USD.<br />

				It just takes time, <br />Before you transfer money from blockchain into SR , transfer them through a few instawallets and easywallets first to launder it slightly, SR has a tumbler but you really dont wanna buy the BTC then from blockchain transfer them directly into SR, bad move. <br />after you&#039;ve used the instawallets and easywallets you can use BitcoinFog but it does cost, on the other hand though if your spending a lot of money, then it might be worth it .
