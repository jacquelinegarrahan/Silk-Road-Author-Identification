				https://www.bittylicious.com/<br /><br />This exchange has only been up and running since 26/06, since very little people will know about it i thought i would start a thread so we could share experiences of their services.<br /><br />Unfortunately I will be on holiday next week (not really unfortunate) so i wont be able to test this until i am back. Once i have purchased i will leave a review here.<br /><br />

				Just to update on this, made a purchase of 0.5, it was cheaper than any seller bitbargain, but a bit more expensive than the cheapest option on local bitcoins, transaction took no more than 15 mins(to my Bitcoin QT). <br /><br />You do NOT need to register.<br /><br />They are still growing so they do still have downtime, but making a first transaction was easier than using localbitcoins or bitbargain very newbie friendly. The amount you are allowed to purchase will be restricted at first but after a few purchases i imagine this will not be an issue.<br /><br />Recommended.

				Worth mentioning that they only accept bank account transfers so bear in mind that this transaction will show up in your bank records and can be made available to law enforcement.
