				Is it more secure to send messages via tor email for example?&nbsp; My concern being if a seller isn&#039;t diligent about deleting messages.&nbsp; If somehow SR was compromised and the encrypted GPG messages were available, would that be a risk?

				No need to worry if they are encrypted, no matter if it is Tormail or SR. If not then you are fucked in both cases- Which fuck is more likely to occur ? No idea, toss a dice.

				Trust no one, always encrypt.&nbsp; <br /><br />No matter what system you use, the message you send will always be sitting on a server temporarily, somewhere.&nbsp; You do not personally know the administration of any of the sites you&#039;re on, so why would you trust that any of them handle your information securely?&nbsp; The only way to ensure that someone isnt spying on your purchase/request/communication is to encrypt the message straight to the individual you&#039;re trying to communicate with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Silk Road provides a good service, but do you trust them with your information?&nbsp; Are you positive that they&#039;re deleting all your information/address?&nbsp; Do you trust that the vendor will delete your address/message immediately?&nbsp; Are you sure the Vendor is going to check their purchases before SR goes down, or gets hacked, or seized?&nbsp; We can assume that this is actually a pretty safe place to do business, and I&#039;m not trying to discourage you from doing business here.&nbsp; Just realize that this is not near a perfect system, and most people here are conducting illegal activities on a site that is internationally recognized as providing illegal resources.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only safe assumption is to assume you&#039;re being watched.&nbsp; So protect yourself.&nbsp; ENCRYPT ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. <br /><br />if you dont know how to setup PGP/GPG encryption, please check the forums here, or use this onion, which is dedicated to helping people setup encryption on their computer:&nbsp; http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/<br /><br />Stay Safe!<br />-wicked420

				Thanks wicked.&nbsp; I&#039;m already doing all the above.&nbsp; I was just thinking out loud that having no direct control over how messages are stored on SR is a weak vector in the scheme of things.&nbsp; It&#039;s unlikely but in theory a vendor is busted, encrypted message are intercepted, and coughed up password is used to decrypt.&nbsp; Again highly unlikely.<br /><br />Although I do believe using public keys that expire would help somewhat?
