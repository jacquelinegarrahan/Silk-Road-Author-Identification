				What&#039;s a safe place to store it so that if the LE comes storming they are not able to find anything? Right now my shit isnt too secure but i think any place that i could think of they would probably find it.<br /><br />I know its best to not have anything on you but i cant give this to anybody else.<br /><br />EDIT - Dont tell me the the specific location but just the general idea :)

				Guys I don&#039;t mean to be a dick but do you really think LE don&#039;t read these forums? This thread may have been started by LE. <br /><br />You&#039;re giving away ideas for a hiding place. While &quot;out the back&quot; or &quot;in the woods&quot; is very nondescript, saying stuff like &quot;ceiling height&quot; is giving officers more ideas of where to look and you&#039;re giving the game away for all of us. <br /><br />I love SR and its forums as it highlights that most drug users are ordinary people who choose different forms of release than the conventional but please remember people, this shit is still illegal and we have to be careful. Giving away hiding place suggestions is kinda like giving the enemy help in reducing your, and other people&#039;s freedom. It just doesn&#039;t make sense.

				Anywhere smart can be good.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying where I have mine hidden, but another friend of mine who carries a fair bit of stock basically built a false backing into a few of his cabinets that is inset into his wall.&nbsp; He can put about 10lbs in there and there is only one way it can be removed.&nbsp; ceiling is good, hell even in the middle of a bag of frozen veggies in your deep freezer.<br /><br />The one thing I do recommend, though, is that if you are carrying anything over personal usage amounts you be sure to vac seal your product.&nbsp; For products like cannabis, this makes it smaller and easier to hide, and gets the dog out of the equation.<br /><br />But yeah, I wouldn&#039;t be posting TOO many specifics on here since the overlord trolls are sure to be about and the more ideas we give them the worse it is for us.

				I think up your butt is the only way to go.&nbsp; People might not like the idea, but the way I look at it, you can stick something up your butt willingly, or you can go to prison and have somebody stick something up your butt unwillingly.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason you rarely hear about somebody getting caught with 5kg of coke up their butt.&nbsp; The dogs can&#039;t smell it over the poop, unless you fart.

				Not at my house that&#039;s for sure... I only have personal use stuff here. I&#039;m thankful to know people I can trust that don&#039;t even do anything that are totally cool letting me use their safe spot wherever they are at. All I have at home can be eaten. If it gets to that point, I will no doubt be tripping balls for fucking days, but its better than getting rolled.<br /><br />If you keep the stuff at home, I suggest you keep that shit very organized so that you can just grab and go if things get bad. I have a feeling that before shit hits the fan, there will be undercovers following you trying to get the evidence they need for a warrant. I personally always run around the block (exercise and scoping out undercovers and such) and ALWAYS make sure I know that no one is following me. Call me paranoid, but it is better than getting rolled.<br /><br />peace

				I never had to stash anything, but I read in the news a clever way to hide a big stash for a longer period of time: find a spot in the house where you could break a few bricks living enough space and reconstruct the wall.
