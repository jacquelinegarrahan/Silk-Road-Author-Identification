				I also have been having the exact same issue. Took me a few days to figure out how to buy 1700$ worth of BTC. The best thing is just to go to the bitcointalk forums and find someone there. There are a few different widely known reputable services there depending on what major banks you are near. Wellsfargo/BofA, BCB is legit. Thats who I just used to do this order, a bit higher than bitinstant though.. He charged 6%.. All I had to do was deposit into wells fargo account though. much easier and safer than bitinstant, so figured the price premium was worth it. If you take your time thought you can find other people lower, Tangible Cryptography was another group I used to buy large coin from for cash bank deposits. They only charged 1.8%.<br /><br />Aside from that, I&#039;m afraid there&#039;s nothing else anymore for cash methods at the moment other than localbitcoins...&nbsp;

				Ask a vendor that you&#039;ve purchased from a few times if you can mail them cash. I imagine that vendors are stressing about how to change BTC into cash, so it kills 2 birds with one stone!

				you could try that proposition, but there&#039;s a reason why bitcoins exist in the first place. a smart vendor wouldn&#039;t want to sell illegal drugs AND expose his personal address to his buyers. it&#039;s a bad idea.

Don&#039;t ask a random vendor, pick someone who&#039;s got their shit together. It&#039;s pretty damn easy to put a few hundred in a birthday card and send it out. I already know what city he&#039;s sending his parcels from after a few orders, it&#039;s not like I gain any further advantage against him by knowing his drop. He&#039;s got mine.

				Localbitcoins.com I Just did this yesterday for 1400USD and it was so simple and easy. I handed the cash over to seller and instantly the BTC was in my e-wallet associated with the site, transferred to other wallet in 40 minutes and then to Sr in under an hour. Look for a vendor with positive feedback reputation. Meet somewhere with wifi to watch on your laptop throughout the whole process or have the conformation sent via sms text to your phone, its literally instant. I love BTS but with them being gone and having issues, not to mention order taking days to accepted for trading LBTC is my new go to for BTC.<br />So far my value of BTC has increased in value 100USD down to 50USD plus, come on baby lets get a big jummp ;D ;D<br />

				is there anyway to buy btc with localbitcoins using moneygram at cvs?&nbsp; bitinstant wants too much info just like everything else out there.&nbsp; only thing i was going to do next was deposit money into wellsfargo and use coinbase.&nbsp; seems like coinbase may be the only non sketchy system to go with
