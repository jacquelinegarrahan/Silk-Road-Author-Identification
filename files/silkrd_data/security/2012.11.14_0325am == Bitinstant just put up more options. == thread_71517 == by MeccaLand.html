				I am thinking of accepting Wells Fargo bank deposits, American Express serve deposits, moneypak, and direct visa and MasterCard payments for Bitcoin however must find a web and application developer to help facilitate in the design and coding of a site to facilitate such transactions. I also am looking into payments via phone and 900 number as well as the standard moneygram western union etc etc options. At this point I already have been approved and setup with multiple merchant accounts to process the credit cards and already have a Wells Fargo account set up.&nbsp; Just not sure about how to get it all going. I have been kicking te idea around for awhile ad pretty much would probably only be able to fund transfers of no more then 500 per person per day. I however am thinking that building the credibility to be successfull from the jump would be the hardest part. If anyone is interested in taking part I have a few ideas how to make it all work the biggest point being avoiding chargebacks fraud and having a surplus of coin at low enough rates that keeps things profitable. My merchant processor will not pass charge backs to me unless they are resulting from fraudulent transactions so obviously a ideal situation would be a system that keeps the end user anonymous but allows us to effectively verify the end users information without having to store any information long term.<br /><br />Another thought I had would be to create a pool that would rely on investors deposits to keep the coins flowing to the buyers...<br /><br />Any ideas would be appreciated ... Bitinstant surely has fallen off as of late ad or the right people at the right place at the right time one could capitalize off there mistakes easily.
