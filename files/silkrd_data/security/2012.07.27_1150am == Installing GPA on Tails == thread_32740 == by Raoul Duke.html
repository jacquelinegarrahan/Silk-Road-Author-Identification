				hey all,<br /><br />i&#039;m trying to completely clear my PC of anything dodgy, so i&#039;ve been looking into Liberte and Tails. Liberte doesn&#039;t seem to play very nicely with my hardware for some reason, which is a shame, but Tails is looking good so far.<br /><br />i&#039;ve hit a bit of a snag - i am a Windows person, i know the system inside out. i know a fair bit about OS X as well, but i&#039;m not an expert, and i know precisely fuck all about linux.<br /><br />i&#039;m doing ok so far with Tails but i&#039;m just a bit stuck with one part of it, it&#039;s the last thing i need to do before i dban my windows machine to clear any remnants of Tor off it - on Windows i use GPA to handle my encryption, i like it as it&#039;s a simple interface and it does everything i want it to, and i know you can get it for Linux because i saw it when i installed Liberte. i would like to install it on Tails but have no idea how to do it. <br /><br />can someone please explain to me, step by step to a Linux virgin (ie instructions as if i was retarded), how to get GPA installed on Tails. pretty please. with cherries :) <br /><br />its a completely vanilla copy of Tails, i have done nothing to it apart from configure a static IP and a Tor bridge<br /><br />muchas gracias amigos :)

				I&#039;m sure a tin-foil hat TAILS extroadinairre will jump in soon.<br /><br />Yeah, sucks balls that most people give up on Liberte due to incompatibility issues. Mine was with my wireless driver. I&#039;d fucking love to run Liberte because it means I don&#039;t have to run a mac-spoofing script every bloody time I start up. Ce la vie.<br /><br />From my understanding, since TAILS is a live USB you cannot install additional programs without compiling yourself or reinstalling upon every startup.<br /><br />Tails comes preinstalled with Seahorse encryption manager which allows you to create, manage, import and export PGP and SSH keys (Preferences&gt;&gt;Password and Encryption Keys). I generally use the Text Editor to write messages and then encrypt (there&#039;s probably a much better way to do this, but after a while you get sick of trolling through forums trying to find fixes that should really be in a sticky somewhere). I save my keys and other incriminating stuff on another USB in a hidden volume encrypted with truecrypt with a whole bunch of homosexual midget porn on the non-encrypted volume. Everytime I start TAILS (after invoking truecrypt at startup) I just decrypt the volume, import all my keys and I&#039;m good to go. Strangely enough, I have never felt the urge to mount the non-hidden volume.<br /><br />Good luck bruv. All these fucking Linux distros and security issues make my head hurt at times

				Ok cheers dudes. So you have to import your keys each time you log on? Even with persistence enabled?
