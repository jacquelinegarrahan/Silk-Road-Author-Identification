				When we buy from a vendor, we import their keys into PGP and write out our address in the clipboard, then encrypt it using their key right?<br /><br />My question is, do we include our own key in the message, and are we meant to click &quot;sign&quot; along with encrypt?<br /><br />Thanks

				If you wish for the vendor to respond to you encrypted then include your public key inside your encrypted message.<br /><br />Do not sign. When you &#039;sign&#039; a message it means that the vendor can only decrypt your message if he has already imported your public key. This is the number one issue I have when decrypting customer messages. Additionally, when you sign you are proving that you did send the message, and this could be used as evidence against you if the vendor&#039;s data was ever compromised. Not signing helps maintain your &#039;plausible deniability&#039;. Nomad Bloodbath has a good post talking about this issue if you care to search it out.

				Good point nightcrawler. However they would need to proof that you -and only you- actually own that private key. Is that a likely risk?<br /><br />Still I agree with you. You have to be careful with the things you append your signature too. Just like in real life really.
