				there is a little search box in the top right of your screen. you should use it. this topic has been covered many times before. but for the sake of it, here goes just one of many methods there are for obtaining btc.<br /><br />you buy your btc from an exchange like mtgox.com or tradehill.com (protip: just two of many. see bitcoincharts.com for a good list)<br />most anonymous way to fund your account is with libertyreserve.com (protip: cant use tor with this site so use public wifi)<br />you can send money with western union to one of the liberty reserve exchangers listed on the site (no id needed for western union payments less than $1000USD ($500 in some areas?) use a fake name) <br /><br />again there are many other ways to get btc. all have pros and cons. some take hours but have high fees, some take days but only cost $0.25USD. some you fund with your bank acount, and some you can use prepaid moneypaks. i believe the one i posted about takes about 24 hours cash to btc&#039;s with a fee of about 5-6% plus western union fees.

				I can sell you some BTC if you want. Im charging $12USD/BTC though, and I only take WesternUnion w/ no I.D. required for pickup &amp; a test question. As soon as I get the cash I&#039;ll send you the BTC. Im a reputable vendor here. Im not looking to rob anyone. Heres my SR profile if you wanna check me out <br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/13061<br /><br />and heres a link to my thread here on the forum for some feedback <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1175.0<br /><br />If you know some other anonymous methods of transferring money I&#039;d be willing to take suggestions. PM me on SR if youre still interested. I&#039;d prefer if you use PGP. Good luck on your journey friend :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				1) Put money in Dwolla (www.dwolla.com) from your bank account.<br />2) Send money from dwolla to mtgox (www.mtgox.com)<br />3) Buy bitcoins.<br />4) Send bitcoins from mtgox to your wallet.<br />5) Send bitcoins from your wallet to SR.<br /><br />Rinse &amp; Repeat

				Thank you guys for all the help. <br /><br />I set up an account with Dwolla, Im waiting for the deposits to appear in my account so I can get verified.&nbsp; Once verified, I will buy coins from mtx and send them to my wallet then to SR. Thanks for all the help.<br /><br />If this doesnt work, I will buy a western union and message you Mr. Crane

				Considering this was posted in security forum I feel this is appropriate, Dwolla and Mtgox are both known as the most amateur run insecure choices available, both from LEO and hackers.

				make sure you read up on anonymity.<br />there are threads to read to help give you an idea of what to do.<br />from what you have written, it looks like you&#039;re going to do this: personal bank account=&gt;mtgox=&gt;sr<br /><br />......careful
