				I&#039;m relatively new to SR and the security measures one must take, that being said I&#039;m pretty concerned that I may have totally compromised my anonymity as far as bitcoin goes. Like some kindof moron, I thought it would be a good idea to use my tormail email adress for my interac email money transfers that had to do with bitcoin, my thinking at the time was that the history of the transfers would be sent to the tormail adress and thus be hidden. Now I&#039;m faced with the obvious problem that the name on my bank account can now be associated with that email adress, which could then be used to trace my activity online? <br /><br />I run tor for everything, and have been running tails as well (although i just learned that liberte linux is better). however I&#039;m worried i may have exposed myself a little... If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Please excuse my obvious n00b-ism...

				I screwed up in a similar way once.&nbsp; I sucked up the fees, cashed out, and moved on.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t done anything with any of the money.<br /><br />Today, I&#039;m $20 poorer and 10 times smarter.&nbsp; All in all, a cheap lesson.

				yeah it&#039;s funny, i thought i was taking every measure to be secure and, meanwhile making the most obvious mistake ever...lol. Oh well, lesson learned I guess.<br /><br />One other thing, the name of the email address is directly correlated with my username on SR, which I&#039;m guessing means I should abandon that username too? Which leads me to ask, is there a way to have your transactions and messages and such moved discretely from one user account to another/ would it be a feasible request to make to SR admin?<br /><br />

				This is a question best directed to the SR admins. Why&nbsp; don&#039;t you send them a message via the storefront?
