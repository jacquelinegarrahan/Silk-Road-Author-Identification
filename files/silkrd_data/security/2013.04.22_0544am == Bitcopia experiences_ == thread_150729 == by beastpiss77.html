				With bitfloor gone, I&#039;ve been going over my options, and there seem to be very few. I really don&#039;t want to go through the bitinstant moneygram bullshit again - the one time I used it, it worked out fine, but it&#039;s kind of a hassle. Now I&#039;m looking at bitcopia, and it&#039;s looking like a much better option. I like the simple cash bank deposit option, much easier than moneygram. I&#039;m just not seeing a whole lot of people talking about it on here, so I was wondering what people&#039;s experiences with bitcopia are. The few mentions I have seen have been positive.

				Bitcopia is showing a current buy price of $142/BTC, but the current Mt.Gox price is $123. Is this just their fee, or is it wrong? Because if I&#039;m trying to buy 1.2 BTC, it comes out to like $170, meaning I&#039;m paying a $50 fee, which is fucking ridiculous and I won&#039;t be doing that.

				Used bitcopia a few times before I discovered bitfloor. It&#039;s legit, just have to pay an inflated rate. I think the owner has a mtgox business account.

				Well atm Bitcopia is having banking issues, so they are trying to set up new bank deposit options.....I been trying to get bitcoins the past few days and it has turned in to a much harder task than what I am used to

				Man, this is getting really fucking frustrating. Bitcopia is down right now, and their fee is ridiculous anyway - almost $20 extra per BTC?! Come on! Blue Sky Traders seems to only take early orders for the next day. Not ideal for those of us who want coins TODAY. Guess I&#039;m stuck with Bitinstant now.
