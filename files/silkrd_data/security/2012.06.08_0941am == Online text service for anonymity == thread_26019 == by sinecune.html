				Suppose, hypothetically, someone were considering setting up a private mailbox under a fake ID. This service offers an alert for when mail is received, which is useful, but obviously a pitfall when one does not have an untrackable, anonymous phone and sim at ones disposal and wishes to avoid being done for a great many wrongs should something go awry. What if one were to provide an overseas, international number which is tied to a website and publicly displays received texts, and then to access its site via TOR? Would this create any significant risks or complications? I am guessing that the provision of a nonstandard contact number when signing up to a service would not be a flag, but what if the company were to attempt voice contact to such a number? Would that potentially trigger suspicion? It certainly wouldn&#039;t give them any reason or authority to inspect received mail, but is it possible or likely LE could become involved? More generally, is this a sound and reasonable plan, when the premises are not suitable for controlled delivery, and the scope and frequency of items inbound would be modest.<br /><br />My thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;
