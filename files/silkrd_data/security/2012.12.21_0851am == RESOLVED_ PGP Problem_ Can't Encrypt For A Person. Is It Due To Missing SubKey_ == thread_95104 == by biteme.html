				I&#039;m using GPGTools on a Mac running OS X 10.7.<br /><br />I imported a person&#039;s PGP Public Key into my GPG Keychain. <br /><br />When I tried to encrypt a block of text for this person, they were not shown in the list of possible recipients. As a result, I could not encrypt anything for this user.<br /><br />Next, I went to my GPG Keychain and checked the list. The user with whom I had this problem is listed in my Keychain, but when I dig deeper, I find that this is the only name in my Keychain that has no SubKey. Every other name I&#039;ve imported has three components to their listing: a Public Key (pub), a User ID (uid) and a SubKey (sub). This one problem name has only two components: a Public Key (pub) and a User ID (uid); they don&#039;t have a SubKey (sub).<br /><br />I brought this issue up with the person and they didn&#039;t seem to be aware of any problems. They did not mention whether or not other people are having the same problem that I&#039;m having with being unable to encrypt text for them. I suggested that they might need to generate a new PGP Key and make sure that it includes a SubKey. I don&#039;t want to be rude to this person but since I can&#039;t encrypt anything for them, I am concerned about our communications being insecure.<br /><br />Does anyone know if this lack of a SubKey could be the reason why I can&#039;t choose them as a recipient for encrypted text? Could there be a way for me to fix this on my end or does the other person need to fix it on their end? I only recently learned how to use PGP and generated my own Key and it included a SubKey, so it doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s rocket science. How did this other user end up without a SubKey?

Try importing his key, and see if that works. (I&#039;ll include his key at the end of this message.) <br /><br />I&#039;m also running Lion, and I can use DPR&#039;s key no problem.&nbsp; What is most likely happening are one of two things: <br /><br />- You may need to be running the latest nightly build of GPGTools. Try installing the latest nightly build of GPGTools: https://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-latest.dmg<br /><br />- The other possibility is that the copy of the PGP key may be malformed or corrupted; it doesn&#039;t often happen, but is is not unheard of for keys to become mangled or corrupted in transit.&nbsp; <br /><br />PM me a copy of the key, and I&#039;ll try it on my box. <br /><br />NC<br />

				I&#039;ve tried to install the latest nightly build of GPGTools but it won&#039;t run correctly for me. Apparently there is a bug that makes it crash if there is some problem with the entries in the keychain. It&#039;s not that there is technically anything wrong with the keychain entries, but it&#039;s a compatibility issue that they are supposed to fix in a future build.<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess I could try to use a different brand of PGP encryption tool but I think for now I&#039;ll just wait for the next build of GPGTools. If that doesn&#039;t fix it, I might need to explore other options.

				RESOLVED!<br /><br />Nightcrawler helped me figure out a solution. I obtained the October 10th nightly build of GPGTools and installed it. Everything seems to be working now and I can even encrypt for users with Keys that don&#039;t have SubKeys.<br /><br />Thanks! This is a great community to be a part of.
