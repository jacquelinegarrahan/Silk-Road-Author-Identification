				Hope away, last year it would drop overnight %40.<br />The only way to slightly protect yourself is too buy BTC just before you pay for the product.<br />While it&#039;s going up, it&#039;s ok, it&#039;s large drops that hurt.<br />If you hear about somebody stealing large amounts of BTC, a crash will come a week or two later as they cash out.<br /><br />Also there are bots running on the exchanges as well.<br />You can test them by running a few bids ;)<br />

				Looking at the past Bitcoin history I think we&#039;re in for a relatively large value drop sometime soon, probably around 30% then rising a bit. <br /><br />Overall however Bitcoins are a fairly safe investment bet, as there is a limited finite amount and so the value can only increase as long as they stay in use, that is of course until they are all mined and the use increases to the point where their value becomes unworkable and the bubble will spectacularly explode, probably around 2017.

The answer is only to order as many Bitcoins as you need and place your order as soon as you have them.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />V.
