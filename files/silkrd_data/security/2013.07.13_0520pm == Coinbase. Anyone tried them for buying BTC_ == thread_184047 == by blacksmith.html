				If you become a level 2 buyer/seller on coinbase you can buy instantaneously now. It does require further verification of your personal info, though.<br /><br />Not like that matters -- they already know who you are through your bank account.<br />

				Been using coinbase for the last few months now. Recently decided the hell with it and became a level 2 buyer, the instant transfers (still takes about an hour minimum to move it to SR) is much better than the 4 business days for level 1 users.

				I have only used coinbase, so far. I found them trustworthy, and communication was fabulous. They are slower than molasses in a midwinter freeze, but they do deliver for a fairly reasonable rate. <br /><br />I am limited in my transportation, as my r foot is broken, and I am stuck in a frankenboot for the next bit. They will do the transactions without me having to leave the domicile. As you all know, a cat&#039;s castle is their kingdom. I am intrigued by this level whatchamachallit for to expedite the fundage. Will investigate further.

				I use them and find them the least painful to deal with atm. Can&#039;t really find anyone through local bitcoins and I hear Blue Sky Traders is backed up. I used bitinstant one last time after the update but said to hell with them. I would bitch about how slow coinbase is but because it&#039;s so slow it motivates me to save more money on my goals instead of spending it on drugs all the time.

				just checked them out - was skeptical about the 1% fee, figured they&#039;d make it up in the exchange rate quote, but the quote really wasn&#039;t bad compared to what mt gox is currently quoting. coinbase was at $92.50 USD for a bitcoin w/1% fee of $1.85 on two coins which is all i wanted. They were a couple $&nbsp; change under Mt Gox&#039;s last quote for the day and about $0.80 under Mt Gox&#039;s lowest quote for the day<br /><br />now the downside for me, they want full verification, ie bank acct and phone number for verification and that is required for purchase - i swear i hate giving that info out<br /><br />i&#039;ll probably go with them - tks for mentioning them
