				So i have always followed basic rules(Use PGP etc) but recently i am starting to stress out a little more over my security.<br /><br />So i would like too:<br /><br />1) Clean my computer<br />2) Start using Tails/VPN/Some other added security<br />3) Find out a little more about being verified at an exchange.<br /><br /><br /><br />1) Apparently, to actually clean your computer you need to erase, fill and then erase again correct?<br />1b)After i clean it, would buying a 200 laptop and using that at a local wifi a better option for browsing TOR/SR<br /><br />2)Tails? VPN?<br /><br />3)I am currently verified at an exchange that allows up to 10k deposit per month in cash. I have the cash right beside me, can i just go deposit it without worry seeing as i am &quot;allowed&quot; to do so?<br />My income would probably not be a reasonable jusitification for that amount into the bank, but would 1 time flag anything?<br /><br />Am in the process of getting about 5 other verified accounts under different names with different incomes. Could i put 2-3k/month under each name even if there incomes are only ~1200/mo? Should i keep it to about 1k per month? Forget it and find another way?<br />

				Not sure if this helps but make sure to keep your transactions below 10 grand...preferably just do a couple of transactions a week for several thousand.&nbsp; Anytime you go past that 10grand mark that usually incurs the eye of the authorities (or at the very least requires you to fill out more paperwork explaining just how that money came to you and how you earned it).&nbsp; Also try not to make habits (for example w/draw a grand a week every week...rather do a grand one week..700 the next..800 the next..500 the next..etc) as those can be flagged as well.&nbsp; <br />Hope this helps somewhat<br /><br />TinyDot

				Hey dude, Idk anything about VPNs really, nothing useful anyway but to clean your HD you will need to uninstall and reinstall your OS.<br /><br />You will need a windows disk (for PC anyway). If you do not have one, you can buy the ISO DL on SR for like 2 bucks. Burn that as an ISO imagine to a dvd. Install. <br /><br />Then i would suggest TAILS OS for total security. Same idea, DL the ISO, burn to disk, install. Then in the accessories tab there is an option to load the OS to a USB stick. You will need 2gigs minimum for this. <br /><br />Best of luck, hope i was helpful.

				Thanks for the responses. <br /><br />As for reinstalling windows i have done it before without any issues but from what i understand the data on your HD can be restored unless you overwrite it, and then erase it again?<br /><br />And as for tails, do i still run windows on my main PC and then just put the Tails OS on a USB? I already have a 4G USB i have TOR/other SR related things on, is this fine?<br /><br />While depositing funds, is there any way to tell when you have been &quot;noticed&quot; or &quot;flagged&quot;?<br /><br />

Burn to disc or USB, reboot and when installing select &#039;Guided install with LUKS/LVM and encryption&#039;. It will erase all data overwriting with random values and encrypt the drive for you, basically killing all forensics.

Let me guess, cavirtex? They probably have to keep all records for 7 years. There&#039;s guy&#039;s who will cash out out or sell you $10k worth of bitcoins on localbitcoins. You would be better to register a small business, get a business bank account, and then verify that business with the exchange for unlimited transfers. Now end of year do taxes and whittle them down to hardly anything because corporations get ridiculous tax breaks. Say your business is selling DDOS protection they will have no idea the $10k worth of coins you cashed out or bought didn&#039;t go to those services instead of you secretly keeping them for laundering or something else. <br />

Tails can be downloaded for free and the instructions above just describe how to create a bootable USB so that your computer itself stays clean. <br /><br />And for the OP: <br /><br />The ideal online security system depends a little on your own skill &amp; background &amp; personal preferences. Some like Tails, some prefer an encrypted VM routed through Whonix, others like Liberte, etc.&nbsp; Some just use their main machine but just boot from a different OS, others have an entirely separate laptop. The system best for you depends on your needs &amp; abilities: if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing its too easy to think you&#039;re safer than you are. :)&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing to consider is starting with basic clearnet/PC security. Do your research &amp; set yourself up with a VPN. You&#039;ll learn a lot &amp; won&#039;t risk much if you make a few mistakes while doing so. Once you have that taken care of you can move to SR browsing &amp; buying.

It uses a virtualized routing table with Tor daemon in it&#039;s own chroot to only show internal ip if breached, and a pf filter to prevent anything trying to phone home outside the Tor network. I don&#039;t even use Xorg anymore after reading about Loic Duflot&#039;s exploits with it. It also uses softraid encryption which is now as of 5.3 supported by boot, so no unencrypted /boot to attack.<br /><br />Best thing is the minimalist install hardly ever requires any updates, because BSD usually doesn&#039;t have any security fixes between releases. If there&#039;s a security issue I patch the source, rebuild and flash but I&#039;ve only had to do that twice and both times were to update Tor. Patch is a few kilobytes as compared to a 2G download every couple of weeks whenever Tails immense complex 3rd party addons require security fixes. Eventually I&#039;ll run a site like Liberte Linux and hand it out for anybody who wants to use it, but it&#039;s total neckbeard without any X friendly apps. If you want to do this yourself buy or pirate Absolute OpenBSD version 2, and the book of pf version 2.

				That&#039;s great for an advanced user, but Tails is the best out-the-box anonymity and security solution for newbies.<br /><br />People here need advice that&#039;s actually doable and useful for them. They are not going to be installing OpenBSD.
