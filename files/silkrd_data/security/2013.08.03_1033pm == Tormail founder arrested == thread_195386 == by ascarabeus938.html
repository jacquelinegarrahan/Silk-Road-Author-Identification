				Yikes I wonder how they traced somebody who used virtual machine isolation plus Tor. It seems that either they broke Tor to trace him or they hacked into his server and busted out of layers of virtual machines. In either case that is fucking scary.

				I always thought it was stupid that Tor Project left javascript on by default in Tor Browser. I really question a lot of choices that they make in the name of making their software more user friendly. Leaving javascript on to &quot;hide your browser fingerprint in a larger crowd&quot; might turn out to be about the same as wrapping a rope around your neck , tying it to a fan, and jumping off a chair, because you don&#039;t want to step on a tack on the floor.

				To everyone freaking out: Most of the people on this board are users, not vendors. If you are a user it is doubtful you have much to worry about. LEO is already overloaded with cases to investigate and they primarily go for sellers, not buyers. Not that they won&#039;t bust a buyer if it lands in their lap but they are not going to spend time investigating someone who bought three hits of acid six months ago (or last week for that matter). Yes you should be very careful, use pgp, etc, but there is entirely too much paranoia among buyers on here in my opinion.<br /><br />mm

				Has anyone read this?&nbsp; Apparently there was a javascript exploit placed on the tormail site by the fbi during the window of when it was seized up until when it became public knowledge that it was seized.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The founder of Freedom Hosting has been arrested in Ireland and is awaiting extradition to USA.<br /><br />In a crackdown that FBI claims to be about hunting down pedophiles, half of the onion sites in the TOR network has been compromised, including the e-mail counterpart of TOR deep web, TORmail.<br /><br />http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/fbi-bids-to-extradite-largest-childporn-dealer-on-planet-29469402.html<br /><br />This is undoubtedly a big blow to the TOR community, Crypto Anarchists, and more generally, to Internet anonymity. All of this happening during DEFCON.<br /><br />If you happen to use and account name and or password combinations that you have re used in the TOR deep web, change them NOW.<br /><br />Eric Eoin Marques who was arrested runs a company called Host Ultra Limited.<br /><br />http://www.solocheck.ie/Irish-Company/Host-Ultra-Limited-399806<br />http://www.hostultra.com/<br /><br />He has an account at WebHosting Talk forums.<br /><br />http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=157698<br /><br />A few days ago there were mass outages of Tor hidden services that predominantly effected Freedom Hosting websites.<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/ltj1j1j6v/<br /><br />“Down for Maintenance<br />Sorry, This server is currently offline for maintenance. Please try again in a few hours.”<br /><br />If you saw this while browsing Tor you went to an onion hosted by Freedom Hosting. The javascript exploit was injected into your browser if you had javascript enabled.<br /><br />What the exploit does:<br /><br />The JavaScript zero-day exploit that creates a unique cookie and sends a request to a random server that basically fingerprints your browser in some way, which is probably then correlated somewhere else since the cookie doesn’t get deleted. Presumably it reports the victim’s IP back to the FBI.<br /><br />An iframe is injected into FH-hosted sites:<br /><br />TOR/FREEDOM HOST COMPORMISED<br />By: a guest on Aug 3rd, 2013<br />http://pastebin.com/pmGEj9bV<br /><br />Which leads to this obfuscated code:<br /><br />Javascript Mozilla Pastebin<br />Posted by Anonymous on Sun 4th Aug 02:52<br />http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2776374<br /><br />FH STILL COMPROMISED<br />By: a guest on Aug 3rd, 2013<br />http://pastebin.com/K61QZpzb<br /><br />FBI Hidden Service in connection with the JavaScript exploit:<br />7ydnpplko5lbgfx5<br /><br />Who’s affected Time scales:<br /><br />Anyone who accessed an FH site in the past two days with JavaScript enabled. Eric Eoin Marques was arrested on Sunday so that’s the earliest possible date.<br /><br />“In this paper we expose flaws both in the design and implementation of Tor’s hidden services that allow an attacker to measure the popularity of arbitrary hidden services, take down hidden services and deanonymize hidden services<br />Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization”<br /><br />http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf<br /><br />The FBI Ran a Child Porn Site for Two Whole Weeks<br />http://gizmodo.com/why-the-fbi-ran-a-child-porn-site-for-two-whole-weeks-510247728<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/o4qaep8pz/<br /><br />On any other day one would say these sick perverts got what they deserved. Unfortunately the Feds are stepping far beyond just pedophiles in this latest issue.<br /><br />The js inserted at Freedom Hosting? Nothing really, just an iframe inject script with a UUID embedded server-side.<br /><br />The iframe then delivers an exploit kit that appears to be a JavaScript 0day leading to…something. It only attempts to exploit Firefox (17 and up) on Windows NT. There’s definitely some heap spraying and some possible shell code. The suspect shell code block contains some strings that look to formulate an HTTP request, but I haven’t been able to collect the final payload yet. The shell code also contains the UUID with which the exploit was delivered. Any UUID will work to get this part of the exploit.<br /><br />I’m still pulling this little bundle of malware apart. So far, I’ve got that the attack is split across three separate files, each loaded into an iframe. Calls are made between the frames to further obfuscate the control flow. The ‘content_2.html’ and ‘content_3.html’ files are only served up if the request “looks like” Firefox and has a correct Referer header. The ‘content_2.html’ is loaded from the main exploit iframe and in turn loads ‘content_3.html’.<br /><br />Short version. Preliminary analysis: This little thing probably CAN reach out without going through Tor. It appears to be exploiting the JavaScript runtime in Firefox to download something.<br /><br />UPDATE: The exploit only affects Firefox 17 and involves several JS heap-sprays. Note that the current Extended Support Release is Firefox 17, so this may also affect some large organizations using Firefox ESR.<br /><br />http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2777139<br /><br />The script will only attempt the exploit on Firefox 17, so I’m no longer worried about it being some new 0day. Enough of the “Critical” MFSAs are for various sorts of memory corruption that I don’t have the time to find out if this is actually a new exploit or something seen before.<br /><br />http://postimg.org/image/mb66vvjsh/<br /><br />Logical outcomes from this?<br /><br />1. FBI/NSA just shut down the #1 biggest hosting site and #1 most wanted person on Tor<br /><br />2. Silkroad is next on their list, being the #2 most wanted (#1 was Child Porn, #2 is drugs)<br /><br />3. Bitcoin and all crypto currenecies set to absolutely CRASH as a result since the feds can not completely control this currency as they please.<br /><br />I don’t always call the Feds agenda transparent, but when i do, I say they can be trying harder.[/quote<br /><br />Anyone know anything about this?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I didn&#039;t mean &quot;has anyone heard about tormail being seized?&quot; obviously, yes, that&#039;s why this thread is here.&nbsp; I was referring more specifically to the concrete evidence of an fbi-placed javascript exploit that may have revealed the IP addresses of a lot of users.&nbsp; That has not been previously mentioned in this thread.

				As of 8:52 PM UTC the tormail .org and .onion domains are back up. The no-javascript email client is 404 but the roundcube client (requires javascript) is accessible. <br /><br />Does this make anyone else suspicious? Their server host gets taken down using a java exploit and now you can only login using the javascript client? It does not seem hard to set up a man-in-the-middle attack to target tormail users&#039; login info if you only have control of the hidden service login page and not the data servers themselves.

				Look, they aren&#039;t interested in some piddly Silk Road user that can&#039;t even give them the name of the person they buy from. From what I read, they arrested this guy and set up an exploit that compromised half the nodes in the Tor network and also set up a fake server maintenance page for this guy&#039;s hosting service. I imagine they then took the CP sites offline hoping the admins of those sites would come along and ask for server maintenance and they could get an IP. From what I read SR is hosted on these same servers and if any admin here went to that page they could be compromised. That being said, this is a CP operation from everything they have said. They are looking for sick fucks that like that kind of stuff and distribute it. I don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about if you are a small time buyer here. The people that need to be worried are any site admins that have had contact with freedom hosting through that page that could have revealed their true IP. Unless you are a pedo frequenting pedo servers or running one I wouldn&#039;t care. If the FBI took an interest in SR during this operation it would be to arrest the admins and take the site offline and seize their bank accounts. Maybe they would go after vendors, but the reality is taking the site offline permanently would be a huge newsworthy win for them and that&#039;s what they care about.

				I simply repeated two things reported in some of the articles. So if that&#039;s not correct fine. They claim SR was hosted there but obviously SR is still up. Maybe it was hosted there in the past, I have no idea. Of course if they are only after CP sites they may not have shut down all the site that FH is hosting.

It also exploited HackBB and other non diddler sites. It now doesn&#039;t look like the attack worked, or was specifically targeted to a certain user(s) they were after. If you used updated Tor Browser Bundle you didn&#039;t get compromised because Noscript is running by default. If you used home made Tor like FireFox w/proxy addon you&#039;re screwed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That goes against other info where I read the javascript was injected through the use of an i frame which is not blocked by no-script or Tor Browser bundle by default.<br />Not trying to break your balls here but just wondering did you consider this?&nbsp; &nbsp;
