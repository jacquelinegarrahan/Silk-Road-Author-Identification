				Ok so here&#039;s my issue, I have a acer all in one flat screeen desktop on my desk, and then my laptop. <br /><br />Now ISSUE..I dont have WIFI, i have a Dongle broadband connection through verizon and i can only have access to whatever comp i have it plugged into the comps USB..<br /><br />Now my question is... Is there anyway i can set something up where both desktop &amp;Laptop can pick up the connection so i dont have to unplug from desktop and plug into my laptop when i get into bed at night and mess around on my laptop..? Or is there no way around it, just access for where ever its plugged,?<br /><br />I was wondering if i had a router /which i do, and plug the router and the ethernet cords to the desktop would it put off the 4G signal when im connected to the net or no?<br /><br />May sound stupid but this is my first time EVER with this dongle crap and i hate it, Im getting my WIFI back ASAP from cricket and just gonna get a Hotbox, I cant even get on Linux with this thing.. So any way possible?

				Set up a small linux system with the dongle. <br /><br />Turn on net.ipv4.ip_forward in the kernel and configure iptables for NAT. Attach all the systems to a wired switch and make the IP of the linux box your default gateway.<br /><br />Easy&nbsp; ;D

				You have a couple of options.&nbsp; Either get a wifi switch/router or get a USB wifi dongle.&nbsp; The dongle will probably be cheaper but you&#039;ll get more general use out of the switch/router. <br /><br />USB wifi dongle route: plug the dongle and the 4g into the desktop and torrent Connectify hotspot.&nbsp; Use it to turn your wifi connection into a hotspot and share your 4g connection.&nbsp; Then your laptop wifi can pick it up and use the connection that way.<br /><br />Switch method: use the 4g on the desktop and send a physical line to the switch&#039;s WAN jack.&nbsp; On the pc, share the internet connection over the lan link.&nbsp; Configure the switch to use that as the source of internet and turn on wifi.

				you could go for ics (internet connection sharing) on the device with the dongle, then...<br /><br />no, cos you would need another wireless device to setup the very inelegant and hacky ad-hoc network scenario<br /><br />sorry - late night spouting

				I&#039;m sure you can &#039;bridge&#039; your connection so that if you have your laptop connected to your PC via an ethernet cable they can both use the connection.<br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help. The last time I did anything like this was back when I used windows and that was a long time ago. If you try googling something around bridging and sharing connection via ethernet then it might help. If not just hold out until wifi!

Or you can just buy a new one for like $5. <br /><br />Anyway, this will enable you to share resources across the two machines and there&#039;s probably some software out there to help you setup a streamlined internet sharing arrangement. YMMV.

				Thnx everyone for helping with my question.. I figured Pine would be the one with the best idea for least amount of $.. Im actually gonna just get a Cricket wifi Hotbox the hot box is 100 and the mnthly is 45 bucks, so a one time fee of 150 plus tax isnt bad. Then 45 a mnth after that, No contract at all..<br /><br />I dont know if everyone has Cricket in there area but they if im not mistaken muerged with a Low country Company called Hargray communications..<br /><br />As for the guy who suggested the Linux issue.. LINUX WILL NOT AT ALL RECONIZE my verizon dongle AT ALL. iV DONE research and found where 3 pages of ppl with the same one i have just does not work with linux and will not pick up. I was wanting very badly to switch my laptop to Linux Ubuntu, and i used the WUBI program from the ubuntu site, and tried everything, it will not at all pick up on my dongle i have. <br /><br />I dont even know why i went with verizon 2 years ago, the prices r rediculas, for my Phone and 10GB i pay like 160 a mnth.. I should have from the start got a Hot box from them, but at the time, my other comps were being held hostage by a crazy X.. <br /><br />So my new WIFI im getting, seems like a great deal, If i order off the net, they ship for free Overnight and soon as i get no instalation BS just turn on punch a few things and im online.. Godd thing is, she said the stores offer diffrnt an sometime better deals at times than the net,&nbsp; Where i go to put my Coins on with bitinstant the same Cricket wireless building is there, <br />&nbsp; So I will be killing 2 birds with one stone eaither 1st of next mnth, or 2 weeks when my LONG AWAITED tax money comes.. <br /><br />Have any of you heard of Cricket wirless? maybe its only on the eastcoast in the south area, dunno

Keeps everything wireless that way. And the WiFi Dongle&#039;s range from $8 to $15.
