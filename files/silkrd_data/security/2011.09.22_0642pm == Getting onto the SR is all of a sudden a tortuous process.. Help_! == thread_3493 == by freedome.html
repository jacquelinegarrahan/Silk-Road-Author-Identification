				Hi guys,<br /><br />ever since about last Saturday / Sunday (17th / 18th Sept) it has become almost impossible for me to get onto the SR site. <br /><br />I use my usual bookmark in my Tor FireFox window that I have always used but the server always times out or I get the &#039;SOCS&#039; message, or a blank page.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to run a business, but quite often I just can&#039;t get in to answer emails or gather orders.<br /><br />I was thinking about purchasing the listing &#039;speed up TOR&#039; when I next get in, but saw a warning about it on the forum. Also the issue is only with the SR site on TOR, everything else is fine.<br /><br />Is this the same for a lot of other people or just me? I&#039;m in the U.K.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried using a new identity, it just doesn&#039;t work. <br /><br />Before last Saturday it has been running like a dream.<br /><br />Any info would be useful.<br /><br />Regards.

				In any case, update the Tor Bundle from https://www.torproject.org/<br />Whenever SR or any other .onion site doesn&#039;t load, restart Tor and it will work.

				The Tor network goes through these periods where all the relays are overloaded with too much traffic. Also, the server that Silk Road is using probably can&#039;t handle me, you &amp; everyone else trying to connect to SR at the same time.<br /><br />Trying a new identity doesn&#039;t do much to help the problem with a slowed down connection.&nbsp; This has worked for me in the past: on the Vidalia control panel click on the green onion to stop Tor. This breaks down your current circuit of connections.&nbsp; Wait a few seconds &amp; then click on the stopped Tor icon (the red &quot;X&quot; over the onion) to restart Tor and it will build a new, hopefully faster circuit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.

				Or you can just go into the network panel and close the slow circuits yourself manually, it then builds new ones. Keep doing that until a faster one has been established that works for you. You can view the speed of each tor node. Close any relay circuits that are operating at kilobyte speeds.
