				Hey guys , dunno if i should even bother asking the question on a forum like this ?<br /><br />But anyway im sure there would be some experts out there that mite want to help me out .<br /><br />I have next to no idea about computers etc , but basically what i am after is a really lightweight portable laptop with the most amount of battery life i can get (need it for extensive traveling)<br /><br />It will be setup with a tails bootable usb stick and only used with that.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t have a clue where to start looking , so any help would be awesome!<br /><br />Thanks.

You could get the cheapest laptop with 1080P resolution and be fine.

				I heard good things about ASUS laptops being durable and well built, but I&#039;m no expert.<br />If I had to buy one I&#039;d get that. My ex-gf has one and it&#039;s clockwork.<br />I&#039;d avoid any HP product as they are just the opposite (personal experience), cheap and built to last just until the warranty goes off.

				Netbooks can be cheap, but every HP product is just like that in my opinion. From printers to laptops.<br />IIRC they said they would abandon Pc manufactoring some months ago, unfortunately they didn&#039;t.

				Go for a second hand HP EliteBook 2530p or a Dell D430 and pay with cash.<br />A 12&quot; Display and a Core2Duo CPU is everything you need and with new batterys, you should get 4-5 hours of mobile computing.<br /><br />
