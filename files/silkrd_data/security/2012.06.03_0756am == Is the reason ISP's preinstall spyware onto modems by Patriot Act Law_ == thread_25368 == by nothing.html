				You know when ISPs don&#039;t allow only one modem to be used and all wireless routers sucks and all wired routers as well as expensive most of the time quality is lacking on purpose in the consumer sector of technology ingenuity.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t really understand your question exactly but most ISP&#039;s don&#039;t install &#039;spyware&#039; onto your modem router as they are you ISP and don&#039;t need to. <br /><br />They know exactly what you are doing on all unencrypted traffic as they provide you with your internet and control all the downstream traffic from your house.<br /><br />If you are paranoid about something going on with your router or modem then take an old PC and use that as your router. All a router is, is a cheap PC with special software installed. You can find plenty of that software yourself, and there are secure Linux operating systems made specifically for this purpose. A router you purchase from Best Buy or your ISP gives you is terrible anyway (that&#039;s why they usually are rubbish if you want to torrent at full speed and play a game at the same time) so I advise everyone to make their own anyway.

				Well what is the purpose of the initial internet installalation.&nbsp; Lets say you move and start a new internet ISP.&nbsp; They will have someone come out and install their service and while hooking up the modem install the registration of the modem with the ISP (FBI,ECT.....)<br /><br />This is obviously some security threat stealth on their part no doubt just curious what others thoughts were and how the variables are from their view.<br /><br />

				Just make certain every frame that travels out of your computer&nbsp; &nbsp;has encryption&nbsp; so&nbsp; while they may see the car traveling down the highway&nbsp; &nbsp;if it&#039;s caught it&#039;s of no use to them and discarded. Take example&nbsp; JFK riding&nbsp; in an open car top. The car is your frame and JFK wife all all are all your information in that frame/packets. He got took out because he was not encrypted (protected) if he had a&nbsp; hooded car&nbsp; the frame is scene driving but the person&nbsp; wanting the information inside of it can not&nbsp; get to it.<br /><br />Sorry if im incorrect in some of that but that is to the best of my knowledge.

				This is one reason why I so encourage war-driving when making orders and&nbsp; signing on to finalize and I do not mean your local mcdonalds or&nbsp; coffee or&nbsp; any other business. Stay away from populated places cause of cameras EVERY where and what most fail to understand is&nbsp; cameras can be used to trace a person or car straight back home&nbsp; NOT ALWAYS&nbsp; but in many cases cause if they see you doing an illegal activity at point A&nbsp; and it&#039;s videos&nbsp; they will check the every camera at others stores&nbsp; to the north south east and west to see where you approached from&nbsp; then&nbsp; just follow that to another camera. hell if you live in a house or apt in a buissness district you could drive or walk 5 miles&nbsp; rob a place&nbsp; and just have your steppes traced right to your door by checking your steps from camera to camera.<br /><br />So always&nbsp; try and go to remote areas&nbsp; with subdivisions&nbsp; and war-drive and find an open network but BE CERTAIN&nbsp; you are secure on your end&nbsp; and clone your mac for sure at all times for anything not just thins. you are in and out of a danger zone made your order and drive on home.&nbsp; If anyone is lucky enough to have the money to rent a cheap apartment. Find some bum on the street and pay him or her to put it&nbsp; their name. keep your&nbsp; &nbsp;good stuff in that apt or house. Just make sure you change the locks cause that bum can get a key if he wants since its in his name.. Especially if I was a vender moving a lot of shit I would for sure look into what I just suggested. the place is not in your name and every time you go&nbsp; have a friend&nbsp; message or email you from a bogus email account&nbsp; pretending to be a mail or female and carry on a conversation for a bit and have him or her ask you to that address to fuck or what ever that way when asked what you are doing here&nbsp; you can say &quot;Im meeting some lady off the internet she said meet her here&quot; and there is one more&nbsp; level of defense in court just make sure you do&nbsp; a fresh conversation IM&nbsp; every time you go to that place cause times can and are checked. <br /><br />400 a month for a rental is a drop in the bucket for the protection insurance it offers you<br /><br />oh and never keep going back to the same open network. always go to a new one.&nbsp; Never know&nbsp; if you have been snagged and being waited on. Besides a&nbsp; creature of habit&nbsp; &nbsp;just aids your enemy
