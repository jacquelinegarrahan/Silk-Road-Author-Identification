				You don&#039;t need to install GPG4USB; just download the software and put the files where you want it. Then hit &#039;start windows&#039; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is just a guess but if you have previously attempted to install GPG4WIN then maybe make sure that is fully uninstalled? Maybe that is confusing it. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would persist with trying to get 4USB to work as it is much easier to use for a beginner.

The same software. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to astor&#039;s tutorial on using gpg4usb - http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />If you intend on using GPA, here&#039;s a basic, little tutorial I wrote to get you started.<br /><br />1. Copy the Public Key of the person you want to send a message to.<br /><br />2. Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the Public Key. Name the file and save it to your desired location on your PC.<br /><br />3. Open GPA (Gpg4win), click IMPORT, locate the file you just saved with the Public Key in it, and double click it. It will then show up in KEY MANAGER where it is stored for future use along with any other Public Keys you wish to keep.<br /><br />4. Then click on CLIPBOARD, the 2nd icon in from the right at the top of the page. Type the message you wish to send to the recipient and then click ENCRYPT. Click on the Public Key of the person your sending the message to (should now be highlighted), then click OK at the bottom.<br /><br />5. Then copy the encrypted message and paste it in a PM to the recipient and send it.<br /><br />6. REMEMBER - Include your Own Public Key in this message if you wish to receive an encrypted response from the recipient. You can find this by RIGHT-CLICKING your key in KEY MANAGER, then copy/pasting it. :)<br /><br />Hope that helps you out. :) :)
