				Did a bunch of research, and it seems that most bitcoin exchangers only accept wire transfers, checks, and ACH. Many people have suggested to use prepaid cards (like visa gift cards), but I can&#039;t find any vendors that accept credit cards.<br /><br />Dwalla does accept credit cards, but you can&#039;t be anonymous with them as they require SSN verification. Other exchangers require some kind of other verification as well that makes anonymity impossible, such as phone number verification.<br /><br />How does everyone here do it? Where does everyone get their bitcoins from? Or do you not bother with anonymity at all? Maybe there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing here...

				Buy them wherever you want. Then move them through multiple instawallet, mtgox, and other exchange/ewallet accounts, using tor. Split the coins into small amounts into each wallet, then send them on to another set of wallets, splitting them again. If you really paranoid, go play on some bitcoin gambling sites that have low risk (so you don&#039;t lose all your coins!), that way your coins get mixed with other users and it doesn&#039;t look like you were trying to mix them. Then send each set of coins to a separate SR address.

				Thank you for replying, everyone.<br /><br />A couple of you mentioned a post/thread with details about exchangebitcoins.com&#039;s cash deposit progress. Did a search for both &quot;exchangebitcoins&quot; and &quot;exchangebitcoins.com&quot; and can&#039;t find this &quot;thread&quot; people are talking about. Can someone care to link me?<br /><br />Also, do I get the deposit slip at the bank and fill it out there with the required info?<br /><br />lucymylove: I&#039;m in the USA and I don&#039;t think they have UKash here. The virtual number thing is interesting, but again, paying for it is usually not anonymous. <br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;ll probably give this cash deposit for exchangebitcoins.com a whirl this weekend. Thanks.

				There are a couple of different threads about exchangebitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp;I just found one on the second page of the security section.<br />Just make sure you do it when the bank is open if you are waiting till this weekend would be some advice I would give.

				no need to buy anonymously. nothing illegal about buying BTC.<br /><br />what you want to do is send them through either a wallet residing on your encrypted volume on your personal machine or send it through InstaWallet accessed over TOR.<br /><br />Basically, break the chain of custody of the coins. Transfer them to a wallet you can deny having control of before you send them to SL.

				USEFUL TIP: &nbsp;I took a completed BOA deposit slip in to fund my exchangebitcoins.com account thinking, wow, this is so easy.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, you have to fill out another type of deposit slip known as an &#039;out of state deposit slip&#039; unless you live in Cali I think.&nbsp; &nbsp;No big deal really but I did request a few more out of state deposit slips for future needs.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The cashier never acted as though my transaction was strange or unusual in any way l if that concerns some of you.

				Can someone tell me what is wrong with my technique?&nbsp; <br /><br />Buy MoneyPak with cash (hoodie and sunglasses optional), send MoneyPak code to a fake account on any exchange that accepts them, and have them transfer new BTC to anonymous Mt.

				That&#039;s the only trail I leave.<br /><br />Even if I use a onlinewallet with Tor to put the money on silkroad, the first step is transfer the money to an exchange, and they can track it very easily, if they get a warrant. But they can&#039;t prove I send the money to bitcoin and can&#039;t prove I ordered something, they just can prove I bought bitcoins, and that&#039;s not illegal anyway.<br /><br />As it&#039;s them who have to prove you ordered, and not you have to prove you don&#039;t order, I believe it&#039;s not a big problem. I even bought with Liberty Reserve out of silkroad (using a fake account with other proxy, sandbox and in private browsing) , they do not accept Tor).<br /><br />In dubio pro reo

				Thanks for all the replies.<br /><br />An update: I went the cash deposit route, and the money was in my account the next morning I checked. Good enough service for me!<br /><br />My next best option I can try next time is the moneypak route via an exchanger here on SR. Seems to be pretty quick and hassle-free as well.<br /><br />Good luck everyone.
