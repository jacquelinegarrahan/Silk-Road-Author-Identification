				I went in to Walmart yesterday to pay a bill and happened to notice that a new sign was posted. Looks like now in order to do your transactions there you need two forms of ID. Guess the gov really wants to know who&#039;s spending money and where&#039;s it going too. ;D

				When did this happen?&nbsp; I read the Moneygram paperwork on the back, and it said that you didn&#039;t need to show any ID as long as your transaction was under $9K (I think that was the magic number - I may be mistaken).&nbsp; Under that amount and they never asked for ID - just made me fill out fake info on the form ;-P

And to think I was going to use them for my next transaction. I guess they really want to be able to trace the money from it&#039;s source? It&#039;s just ridiculous how no matter what it is, somebody somewhere wants to know who you are and what your doing. ;D
