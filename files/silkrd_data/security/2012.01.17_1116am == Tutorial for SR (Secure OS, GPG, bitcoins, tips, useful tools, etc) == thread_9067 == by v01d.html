				Just a tutorial&nbsp; I wrote up after seeing so many people asking the same questions.<br /><br />Download the .doc with the original format:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4.doc<br /><br />For those wary of downloading and running any file here is the pastebin:<br /><br /><br />qPasteBin(no format):<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/paste/show.php?id=fcc21f55e8225274<br /><br />Edit: <br />Also might want to change your desktop address each time you send BTC to an instawallet as well.<br />Visit each instawallet under a new tor identity.<br />

				This may be an inane inquiry, but is it safe to download TrueCrypt?&nbsp; I&#039;m using the Tor Browser Bundle and when I click download it highly recommends I do not use external applications as they can unmask you.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to guess it&#039;s fine because of the source.

				Is there a way to store links and passwords on liberte without using trucrypt?<br />I mean you do need some addresses and links saved to access them from that Linux OS.<br />can you install truecrypt on liberte? <br />how does it work :D<br />also if i&#039;ve already used my PC to use silk road is there a way to erase tracks without formatting?

Or keep it on a USB drive beside your encrypted container (that has a decoy container of course). If I remember correctly you only have something like 4 minutes to use root until it locks out, so USB with Truecrypt debian installer on it best way to go.<br /><br />I know Tails you just press tab when it&#039;s at the language selection screen, and type &quot;truecrypt&quot; then hit enter to boot and it will be available. No idea never used Liberte besides checking it out a few times.
