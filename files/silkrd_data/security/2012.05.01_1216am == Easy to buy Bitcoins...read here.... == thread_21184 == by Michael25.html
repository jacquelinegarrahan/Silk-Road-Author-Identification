				I had a hard time buying bitcoins in the beginning. Since I&#039;ve found BTCKing on here it hasn&#039;t been easier. While there is a fee, it is the EASIEST way to buy coins here. %100 anonymously and never an issue with him. I just wanted to let everyone know if you are having a problem setting up Dwolla and all those crazy accounts, it seems MUCH safer to use BTCKing. All you do is indicate what zip code you are in, tell him how many coins you want and then you go to the bank and make the deposit. By the time I get home the coins are already in my SilkRoad account. I&#039;ve tried a lot of the online buying methods and stuff, and this by far seems to be the most safe and easy for me. I hope everyone enjoys!<br /><br />

				Glad to hear this. It does seem like going through a reputable dealer has to be the best and most discreet way of obtaining coins. Take all these other sites right out of the picture. Haven&#039;t done this yet myself, but I&#039;m looking forward to it.

				I saw that on here he was doing that. I went through my bank transfer. I think I&#039;ll try him from now on.

				Why not buy a money pack and trade it to a vendor for your coins.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I do and it takes the stress out of going into a bank.&nbsp; Yea there&#039;s a small fee but its fucking lighting fast.
