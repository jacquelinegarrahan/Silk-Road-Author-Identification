				well stumbled across this while I was reading about truecrypt http://www.privacylover.com/encryption/analysis-is-there-a-backdoor-in-truecrypt-is-truecrypt-a-cia-honeypot/<br /><br /><br />if tails doesn&#039;t trust it and they don&#039;t public show their code should we trust them with our freedoms?&nbsp; Anyone know a good open source alternitive

				Truecrypt domain registed with a false address<br />Truecrypt developers identity hidden<br />Truecrypt developers working for free<br /><br />All of these points also apply to I2P, most of them also apply to Freenet, and for the most part it all applies to Bitcoin as well. As far as I know nobody knows who actually made I2P other than some pseudonyms, Freenet it is known who made it but he works for donations, Bitcoin nobody knows who made it but a pseudonym and he works for free but probably actually made himself a lot of money in doing so. I don&#039;t know who is maintaining GPG or follow it that closely, but I imagine they are doing it entirely for free. Most of the open source security software is entirely free, hell just look at OpenSSL it is a truly massive cryptographic library that is entirely free. The point is that any one of these points isn&#039;t unique to hardly any security project that is not funded by a corporation, and in the cypherpunk scene projects falling under all three of these criteria are not really out of place at all. You have three distinct groups, the corporate people doing shit for money, the academic people doing shit for knowledge and then the cypherpunks doing shit for ideology and knowledge as well, and the cypherpunk people are generally pretty pseudonymous themselves. <br /><br />Compiling Truecrypt source code increasingly difficult<br /><br />No idea, I am sure because of compiler options it is a bit difficult to get source code to compile exactly to the released binaries, but the thing is if you can do it once then you can validate the source code and the binary. It isn&#039;t like they are releasing a closed source product. <br /><br />Truecrypt license contains distribution restrictions<br /><br />Lots of people have always bitched about Truecrypts license, I think it is fine, I am not a license zealot ready to strap a suicide vest on for GPL like some people are.<br /><br />Truecrypt removed from The Amnesic Incognito Live system <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t mean anything really<br /><br />Truecrypt open source code has never been reviewed<br /><br />This is the biggest concern of all, I certainly have not analyzed Truecrypt and I don&#039;t know if anybody else has but I imagine so considering it is open source and popular.<br /><br />Censorship at Truecrypt forums<br /><br />Is kind of sketchy, Truecrypt forums have a bit of a reputation for being totalitarian shit hole, definitely sketchy<br /><br />Can the FBI crack Truecrypt?<br /><br />Not likely at all from what I have seen<br /><br />Can the NSA crack Truecrypt?<br /><br />Maybe, who knows. I don&#039;t. <br /><br />Conclusion about Truecrypt reliability<br /><br />read the source code let me know how it looks k thnz bye<br />

Only the widespread use of such systems will both provide greater protection for data and protect public safety.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Department&#039;s goal -- and the Administration&#039;s policy -- is to promote the development and use of strong encryption that enhances the privacy of communications and stored data while also preserving law enforcement&#039;s current ability to gain access to evidence as part of a legally authorized search or surveillance.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In this regard, we hope that the availability of highly reliable encryption that provides recovery systems will reduce the demand for other types of encryption, and increase the likelihood that criminals will use recoverable encryption.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />In other words, whether the software is trustworthy is quite independent from whether the devs are sociable people or not. If you you believe the availability of source code is not enough to ensure security, you will have to organize a code audit. There certainly are people outside the TrueCrypt project who look at the source code, so a deliberate backdoor is probably hard to hide, but there might be hidden bugs. This bug in Debian&#039;s OpenSSL package went unnoticed for quite a while.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />All text st 8stolen from a 5 minute search via non logging search engines
