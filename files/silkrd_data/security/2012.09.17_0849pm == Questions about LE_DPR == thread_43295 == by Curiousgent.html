				I&#039;m a UK journalist, working on a story about Silk Road and how governments and law enforcement are responding to Tor hidden services and Bitcoin. I would appreciate if anyone could answer the following questions*: <br /><br />1) How worried are you about law enforcement on Silk Road? <br />2) What worries you more - Tor leaks, your Bitcoins being traced, or inflitration of SR? <br />3) What do you think of Dread Pirate Roberts? <br />4) Do you think buying on SR is preferable to buying them in real life? <br /><br />*If you could tell me if I could quote you, (either anonymously or by handle), that would be appreciated. My aim here is accurate reporting.

				Why are we feeding this guy. He is either a cop or a journo which last time I checked, both had a special circle of hell decked out for them. Whatever the fuck they are let them do their own work, if they want to investigate SR and whatever then let them do some reading and find out what this place is about with actual hard work. Don&#039;t just serve it to them on a plate. If they are so bothered about accuracy like they say they wouldn&#039;t be coming here cap in hand for info, they&#039;d be doing their job themselves and then making an informed opinion based on what they can see which would be interesting to see if it differs from the usual and we could take it from there. <br /><br />Also why so interested in DPR? DPR is a major part of SR but SR and it&#039;s form are more like an ever evolving organism. By just asking about DPR the &quot;reporter&quot; is just doing the same rinse and repeat shit you see all the time. Why don&#039;t they just do their homework like I said and they can make their own informed decision on what we feel and think about DPR and how we perceive him/her. <br /><br />So yeah, in summary, just do your fucking job and find stuff out properly rather than being lazy and just posting a quick thread and getting your job done for ya. <br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m off bed, night all.

We have to be careful.<br />2) A little of all of them.<br />3) Have not met the guy.&nbsp; ;) However I like what he has done with the place.<br />4) Yes, by far! Selling on SR is preferable to selling IRL. IRL I had a guy pull a gun on me over 1/4 lb of Ps. Cubensis mushrooms. You dont have that problem here.<br /><br />I personally believe that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.<br /><br />How I pursue happiness is my business and not the governments. In a free society people are able to make decisions for themselves, to decide how they want to live and to decide what they put in their bodies. For a government to declare that a person is a criminal for the act of taking a substance into there own body is tantamount to the government claiming ownership over that person. I am not owned by my government and do not submit to the believe that the government owns anyone.<br /><br />To quote Thomas Jefferson who was both a British citizen and an American founder &quot;When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.&quot;<br /><br />Ok, Ill put my soap box away.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1) How worried are you about law enforcement on Silk Road?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally I am not that worried at all as I don&#039;t purchase drugs here, having better and more trusted connections through alternative channels with whom I have done business with for several years. From the perspective of a vendor working here, I would not feel exceptionally worried about law enforcement provided that I follow all of the suggested security protocols. It will be extremely difficult for a vendor who does not cut corners in the security department to be busted. Tor is quite decent anonymity and all indications show that the federal police and interpol are incapable of even deanonymizing hidden services, let alone regular clients. GPG offers encryption algorithms that are very widely recognized as unbreakable when proper key sizes are used. Even man in the middle attacks of key exchange are greatly frustrated due to having a publicly viewable anonymously accessible communications channel. I am not aware the specifics of how the server has been secured, however it is a Linux server and DPR at least knows how to run Tor hidden services and write php so it is probably not extremely insecure, at the least. In fact if the server is insecure it only makes a huge difference for people who do not encrypt their addresses, and security is the responsibility of the person who needs to be secure so people should not be relying on a secure silk road server nor do they really need to do so. <br /><br />Additionally it is apparent that we have the knowledge to send packages without leaving forensic trace evidence on them, and with further precautions being taken we can prevent being linked to the packages via technical means (ie: not carrying phones when dropping packs off prevents location based crowd intersection attacks that rely on knowing where multiple packs were shipped from plus having access to cellphone geopositioning data). A lot can change in several decades, but even the Unabomber who was mailing explosives and killing people was not traced through the mail. Additionally several intelligence operatives have shipped package bombs to assassinate targets and I have not heard of any of them being traced. Even the Anthrax shipper, although allegedly identified, was only identified after a multiple year investigation costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, involving not only the mail but also a presumed limited crowd size and much more intelligence than was obtained via investigating the mail. Someday perhaps the feds will be able to use technology to scan large percentages of mail in the system for contraband, however&nbsp; even this is not a threat to vendors. <br /><br />Cashing out Bitcoin anonymously is certainly the most difficult part for a vendor, and even this can be done with proper precautions. Mixing and especially blind mixing of bitcoins can at least cryptographically unlink the identity of a person cashing out bitcoins from a drug deal in which they were sent bitcoins from law enforcement. Immediately this helps in cashing out bitcoins anonymously and obtaining plausible deniability / unlinkability if ever apprehended. I would not rely on mixing alone though, as mixing does not hide that a mix was used and that is valuble intelligence indicating illegal activity in itself, even if it cryptographically unlinks the person who has mixed their bitcoins from any specific illegal transaction. Layering mixing with cashing out via fake ID and money wires or anonymously obtained debit cards will present extreme obstacles to any law enforcement attempts to follow the money to the vendors. Additional cash out techniques exist as well, layering money through multiple forms of electronic currency and exchangers in multiple countries (also through multiple types of traditional money transmission, via exchangers of course) + bitcoin + mixing + fake ID / anonymous ATM debit card cash out will be virtually impossible for law enforcement to untangle. Unfortunately adding so many layers to the cash out procedure can get expensive, but fortunately the drugs sold here are usually marked up enough that it can still be worth it to layer money through so many anonymity increasing hops. Another great technique is simply selling drugs that are cheap in your area at a markup on SR, and then using the bitcoins to buy drugs that are expensive in your area from vendors in areas where they are cheap, and then cashing out by selling the drugs locally. However that does add the risk of doing local face to face dealing. <br /><br />So in summary, and to reiterate, I would not be afraid of law enforcement on SR if I happened to be a vendor here. <br /><br />If I were a customer here I would be moderately more worried. Customers can take advantage of the same security enhancing technologies as vendors, but the major downside is that they can be identified by undercover vendors performing reverse sting operations and also their packages can be intercepted. There are technological solutions to prevent interception leading to arrest (in the form of interception detection technology), however this technology is not currently being utilized by the vendors here. There is no known technique (and probably no possible technique) to prevent an undercover vendor performing reverse stings from identifying customers who order from them, however the use of fake ID private mail boxes, and other techniques that create unlinkability between the customer and the point they pick their product up from, can be utilized to drain significant amounts of law enforcement resources. If we can get to the point that it costs thousands of dollars in surveillance / man hours to identify every customer ordering a ten strip of LSD then we may effectively be able to defeat law enforcements attempts to do reverse sting operations, even if we have not actually fully protected from such attacks. <br /><br />Indeed if you truly want your article to be fair and balanced you should point out that Silk Road and actually the entire online drug scene is/are great examples of how futile the war on drugs is. Law enforcement will never be able to identify or apprehend vendors taking the proper security measures, their best hope will be to bust small time personal use customers, after spending thousands of tax payer dollars on it. So essentially the war on drugs will eventually boil down to a bunch of thugs in the federal government spending thousands of taxpayer dollars (for their own paychecks) to bust mostly educated harmless people who contribute to society, in order to prevent them from privately enjoying in many cases entirely harmless (and in some cases even religiously/spiritually used) drugs. Your article should be about how the DEA is the worst organized crime syndicate in the world, and how its members should be charged with committing crimes against humanity and sentenced to long prison sentences (for which they should feel lucky to get!). The war on drugs is a complete disgrace and the people of the United States need to purge from positions of power all people who have contributed to the ongoing atrocities linked to it, preferably holding them accountable for their actions by severely punishing them. Even though this is unlikely to happen, at least know that we will never be defeated and that if SR is taken down twenty more sites will pop up in its place. Indeed the online drug scene will grow exponentially over the coming years until it becomes the standard channel through which drugs are trafficked. In an ideal scenario from an Agorist point of view, the profits created by this will lead to extremely sophisticated private defense agencies which will hopefully overthrow the police regardless of popular support.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2) What worries you more - Tor leaks, your Bitcoins being traced, or inflitration of SR? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am worried that Tor hidden services are not as anonymous as many think, however I am not as worried about Tor clients. Additionally the police are apparently quite far behind the better security folks on this forum , and recently obtained internal law enforcement documents indicate that they can not trace hidden services. The tracing of the server would not be particularly bad although it could spell disaster for people who do not use GPG to encrypt their messages. It would also complete half of a timing attack against the participants of the server, however half a timing attack is not enough to deanonymize anyone and the attackers abilities to deanonymize users would still be largely frustrated. <br /><br />SR is of course thoroughly infiltrated, it is after all a public market. This is not at all concerned for vendors, the money of the feds is just as good as the money of anyone else after all. For customers it is a concern, however hopefully it is not worth the feds time to attack small personal use customers. it is conceivable that they may do so in an attempt to disrupt the market, however thankfully the charges they could get to stick against these users are likely to be far less than the charges they could get to stick against the actual vendors (although you never really know, it seems that the state has complete control and they can essentially give someone as much time in prison as they like simply by adding more and more charges from a never exhausted supply of laws that must be broken in order to commit any individual crime. Also, the laws of today are severely outdated compared to the crimes of today, they could probably call all of SR one big conspiracy if they wanted to).&nbsp; <br /><br />The anonymity of vendors cashing out is something that concerns me, however there are certainly several&nbsp; ways to securely and anonymously cash out bitcoin. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3) What do you think of Dread Pirate Roberts? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that he is fine :), he has done nothing that I see as bad and additionally we are both Agorists. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4) Do you think buying on SR is preferable to buying them in real life? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hate buying drugs IRL. I much prefer internet sourced drugs. They tend to be higher quality and cheaper. Also the people selling them tend to be much more professional. Historically it has been far less risky to source drugs online than IRL, however with LE starting to focus more attention towards the online scene things could start to change a little here. Law enforcement can also take advantage of the anonymous nature of the internet, thankfully we are way ahead of them. One of the biggest concerns I have is nym flooding attacks, however I believe that we can even mitigate this sort of attack.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*If you could tell me if I could quote you, (either anonymously or by handle), that would be appreciated.

Though I agree that if this person is really a journalist then he should reveal his identity or at least the publication he writes for.<br /><br />As a small volume buyer, I do not worry much, but there is always some creeping paranoia. When it comes to anything other than weed (which I often purchase here as well as in real life), I feel much safer ordering anonymously from the road than trying to find some sketchy hookup at a club. I use PGP/GPG, which means I won&#039;t be in danger even if SR is really run by DEA. One concern is that one of my vendors could be busted while holding a package with my name on it, but proving that I actually purchased something, in a way that could legally stick, would be a difficult challenge. I no longer use my bank account to purchase BTC, instead using cash and false aliases. In fact, the biggest concern I have with respect to security is that word spreads locally that I use the postal system to purchase drugs. Obviously, I am very tight lipped about this, but there are a few close friends who know how I source my party supplies. I usually don&#039;t explain further than &quot;I know somebody,&quot; but you know how information spreads, especially when it concerns something so socially exciting as online, anonymous drug markets and crypto-currencies. If I&#039;m partying with friends and the coppers haul us off for having too much fun, can I trust them not to spill the beans?<br /><br />I would like to say that law enforcement agencies view Silk Road and the online scene as a positive development, moving drug sales out of public view and reducing a lot of harm (less violence, purer products), but the truth is that there is too much momentum behind the status quo for anyone in power to acknowledge this. There&#039;s too much money being made by the major operators and the public officials paid to look the other way. It&#039;s exactly the same case as politicians claiming to help people by shutting down online casinos when the real agenda is to protect the profitability of brick and mortar operations.<br /><br />Feel free to quote, or not. Please give us a heads up when the article is published.

From the perspective of a vendor working here, I would not feel exceptionally worried about law enforcement provided that I follow all of the suggested security protocols. It will be extremely difficult for a vendor who does not cut corners in the security department to be busted. Tor is quite decent anonymity and all indications show that the federal police and interpol are incapable of even deanonymizing hidden services, let alone regular clients. GPG offers encryption algorithms that are very widely recognized as unbreakable when proper key sizes are used. Even man in the middle attacks of key exchange are greatly frustrated due to having a publicly viewable anonymously accessible communications channel. I am not aware the specifics of how the server has been secured, however it is a Linux server and DPR at least knows how to run Tor hidden services and write php so it is probably not extremely insecure, at the least. In fact if the server is insecure it only makes a huge difference for people who do not encrypt their addresses, and security is the responsibility of the person who needs to be secure so people should not be relying on a secure silk road server nor do they really need to do so. <br /><br />Additionally it is apparent that we have the knowledge to send packages without leaving forensic trace evidence on them, and with further precautions being taken we can prevent being linked to the packages via technical means (ie: not carrying phones when dropping packs off prevents location based crowd intersection attacks that rely on knowing where multiple packs were shipped from plus having access to cellphone geopositioning data). A lot can change in several decades, but even the Unabomber who was mailing explosives and killing people was not traced through the mail. Additionally several intelligence operatives have shipped package bombs to assassinate targets and I have not heard of any of them being traced. Even the Anthrax shipper, although allegedly identified, was only identified after a multiple year investigation costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, involving not only the mail but also a presumed limited crowd size and much more intelligence than was obtained via investigating the mail. Someday perhaps the feds will be able to use technology to scan large percentages of mail in the system for contraband, however&nbsp; even this is not a threat to vendors. <br /><br />Cashing out Bitcoin anonymously is certainly the most difficult part for a vendor, and even this can be done with proper precautions. Mixing and especially blind mixing of bitcoins can at least cryptographically unlink the identity of a person cashing out bitcoins from a drug deal in which they were sent bitcoins from law enforcement. Immediately this helps in cashing out bitcoins anonymously and obtaining plausible deniability / unlinkability if ever apprehended. I would not rely on mixing alone though, as mixing does not hide that a mix was used and that is valuble intelligence indicating illegal activity in itself, even if it cryptographically unlinks the person who has mixed their bitcoins from any specific illegal transaction. Layering mixing with cashing out via fake ID and money wires or anonymously obtained debit cards will present extreme obstacles to any law enforcement attempts to follow the money to the vendors. Additional cash out techniques exist as well, layering money through multiple forms of electronic currency and exchangers in multiple countries (also through multiple types of traditional money transmission, via exchangers of course) + bitcoin + mixing + fake ID / anonymous ATM debit card cash out will be virtually impossible for law enforcement to untangle. Unfortunately adding so many layers to the cash out procedure can get expensive, but fortunately the drugs sold here are usually marked up enough that it can still be worth it to layer money through so many anonymity increasing hops. Another great technique is simply selling drugs that are cheap in your area at a markup on SR, and then using the bitcoins to buy drugs that are expensive in your area from vendors in areas where they are cheap, and then cashing out by selling the drugs locally. However that does add the risk of doing local face to face dealing. <br /><br />So in summary, and to reiterate, I would not be afraid of law enforcement on SR if I happened to be a vendor here. <br /><br />If I were a customer here I would be moderately more worried. Customers can take advantage of the same security enhancing technologies as vendors, but the major downside is that they can be identified by undercover vendors performing reverse sting operations and also their packages can be intercepted. There are technological solutions to prevent interception leading to arrest (in the form of interception detection technology), however this technology is not currently being utilized by the vendors here. There is no known technique (and probably no possible technique) to prevent an undercover vendor performing reverse stings from identifying customers who order from them, however the use of fake ID private mail boxes, and other techniques that create unlinkability between the customer and the point they pick their product up from, can be utilized to drain significant amounts of law enforcement resources. If we can get to the point that it costs thousands of dollars in surveillance / man hours to identify every customer ordering a ten strip of LSD then we may effectively be able to defeat law enforcements attempts to do reverse sting operations, even if we have not actually fully protected from such attacks. <br /><br />Indeed if you truly want your article to be fair and balanced you should point out that Silk Road and actually the entire online drug scene is/are great examples of how futile the war on drugs is. Law enforcement will never be able to identify or apprehend vendors taking the proper security measures, their best hope will be to bust small time personal use customers, after spending thousands of tax payer dollars on it. So essentially the war on drugs will eventually boil down to a bunch of thugs in the federal government spending thousands of taxpayer dollars (for their own paychecks) to bust mostly educated harmless people who contribute to society, in order to prevent them from privately enjoying in many cases entirely harmless (and in some cases even religiously/spiritually used) drugs. Your article should be about how the DEA is the worst organized crime syndicate in the world, and how its members should be charged with committing crimes against humanity and sentenced to long prison sentences (for which they should feel lucky to get!). The war on drugs is a complete disgrace and the people of the United States need to purge from positions of power all people who have contributed to the ongoing atrocities linked to it, preferably holding them accountable for their actions by severely punishing them. Even though this is unlikely to happen, at least know that we will never be defeated and that if SR is taken down twenty more sites will pop up in its place. Indeed the online drug scene will grow exponentially over the coming years until it becomes the standard channel through which drugs are trafficked. In an ideal scenario from an Agorist point of view, the profits created by this will lead to extremely sophisticated private defense agencies which will hopefully overthrow the police regardless of popular support.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">2) What worries you more - Tor leaks, your Bitcoins being traced, or inflitration of SR? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am worried that Tor hidden services are not as anonymous as many think, however I am not as worried about Tor clients. Additionally the police are apparently quite far behind the better security folks on this forum , and recently obtained internal law enforcement documents indicate that they can not trace hidden services. The tracing of the server would not be particularly bad although it could spell disaster for people who do not use GPG to encrypt their messages. It would also complete half of a timing attack against the participants of the server, however half a timing attack is not enough to deanonymize anyone and the attackers abilities to deanonymize users would still be largely frustrated. <br /><br />SR is of course thoroughly infiltrated, it is after all a public market. This is not at all concerned for vendors, the money of the feds is just as good as the money of anyone else after all. For customers it is a concern, however hopefully it is not worth the feds time to attack small personal use customers. it is conceivable that they may do so in an attempt to disrupt the market, however thankfully the charges they could get to stick against these users are likely to be far less than the charges they could get to stick against the actual vendors (although you never really know, it seems that the state has complete control and they can essentially give someone as much time in prison as they like simply by adding more and more charges from a never exhausted supply of laws that must be broken in order to commit any individual crime. Also, the laws of today are severely outdated compared to the crimes of today, they could probably call all of SR one big conspiracy if they wanted to).&nbsp; <br /><br />The anonymity of vendors cashing out is something that concerns me, however there are certainly several&nbsp; ways to securely and anonymously cash out bitcoin. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">3) What do you think of Dread Pirate Roberts? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think that he is fine :), he has done nothing that I see as bad and additionally we are both Agorists. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">4) Do you think buying on SR is preferable to buying them in real life? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hate buying drugs IRL. I much prefer internet sourced drugs. They tend to be higher quality and cheaper. Also the people selling them tend to be much more professional. Historically it has been far less risky to source drugs online than IRL, however with LE starting to focus more attention towards the online scene things could start to change a little here. Law enforcement can also take advantage of the anonymous nature of the internet, thankfully we are way ahead of them. One of the biggest concerns I have is nym flooding attacks, however I believe that we can even mitigate this sort of attack.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">*If you could tell me if I could quote you, (either anonymously or by handle), that would be appreciated.

				Answer me this Mr Journalist....<br /><br />How many of your friends use drugs?<br /><br />Would they sooner buy drugs that have reviews and ratings? Safer drugs?<br /><br />Have you ever seen anyone snort coke before noon at work?<br /><br />If you say &#039;never&#039; your not that old are you?<br /><br />In the 90s every major paper had coke users. Some more than others but mostly, journalists have money and like the rest of us like to party. Alcohol is legal, but a few lines of coke might mean you wake up the next day in a better state than if you drank 8 pints or half a bottle of vodka or a bottle of wine. Alcohol is good because its pure. The fact it is illegal is just a coincidence,. If it was illegal, we&#039;d brew it illegally and sell and trade it, illegally. Most people do not care about drugs being illegal. If 100,000 people use some coke next weekend, a few get busted, most get ripped off, but the cops catch a tiny percentage of users. If EVERY user was caught tomorrow, we would have millions of people needing legal help, police station cells, forensics, billions of pounds or a trillion to actually just process everyone. The result would be a million bailed, a million maybe in jail, plus who pays for all this? And who profits?<br /><br />Keeoing drugs illegal is a cash cow. Its easy money and anyone employed to catch drug users and traders actually likes drug dealers. They don&#039;t want people to give up drugs. Many telling us not to use are using themselves! Cops, 10% are using, 20% if you include cl;ass C steroids. Few cops get tested. Their union does not want that. The reason is simple, if we tested every cop and tested them using the latest technology, we would find 10% at least. that means other cops know about drug using cops but say nothing. Grassing up the people you work with for smoking a joint or having 100mg of coke in a relaxed evening in is wrong and we all know it. Even the cops know that. Cops stealing drugs or drug money that is different. Cops working with some of the gangs and syndicates is wrong as that makes honest cops work worthless as gangsters know about any ops against them. Any top gangster in any major town in the UK could find some cop to play with ten years ago. These days, internal police investigations are happening and cops are getting caught. But many cops made top dollar in the day, mainly the cops busting in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. Those cops were buddies as well as work collegues. Some saw £100,000K plus a few kilos of coke. They would take the 100K and leave a kilo and say nothing was found. Dealer is both happy and sad. Sad he lost his stock, happy he never done ten years or more for it! <br /><br />Now, most younger cops would inform if an older cop slipped him a kilo of coke on a raid or to go on some &#039;raid&#039; palin clothes, and sieze money and goods. Cops see a lot of money and temptation. They get paid well but some overreach and end up corrupt.<br /><br />Pay me 20 Bitcoin and I&#039;ll write half your article for you.<br /><br />Your asking us to basically save you reading the site and spending a few days doing that. I have read all the site so I&#039;m not making another man earn by my work if he or she does not give me my rightful share. <br /><br />I promise to spend the 20 BTC on legal drugs. We got some moonshine here. That could kill a child in one. So could the coke your colleagues use if they were reckless parents.<br /><br />And if you say you have never seen coke used, you are not a journalist who has been around that long are you?<br /><br />Soem journalists are good, but if write your article you know that adds risk to this place. Only needs one MP to cry about this and some of us get busted as cops send out for test buys then check out were it comes from or if it has forensics on it. Cops will pose as sellers, to harvest addresses, they could raid a few dozen homes and call it Operation Silk Road, charge a few people for class A small amounts whilst passing the high performance cars owned by &#039;real life&#039; dealers.<br /><br />So, 20 bitcoin or fuck off.<br /><br />Don&#039;t do the work of another person for free! We don&#039;t this person. They want to basically make SR more risky. They know that their article might get some busted but as longs as its not your son, or your wife, or work colleagues or uni mates you still hang with., maybe you do not give a shit about anyone who uses drugs.<br /><br />Most journalists are professional liars. Check out the news in the UK. You guys are about as popular as a dose of the clap.<br /><br />But for 20BTC, I&#039;d work with you.<br /><br />Maybe that is selling myself short because I could write your article, spell-check it, and make it 100% accurate. I&#039;d leave it to the reader to judge the facts.<br /><br />send the bitcoins to redalloverthelandguy on the main site. Don&#039;t quote me unless I&#039;m paid. My words are my intellectual property. I know more about SR than most because I work and its a easy job and I hang out here for fun and obviously to get a little bit high sometimes. I am no addict, no drug abuser, and its rude not to offer people what they want. <br /><br />We are adults now. Not kids in school with no real skillset in judgement or even understanding of the metric system and purity of drugs, recommended doses and so on. <br /><br />SR is just the future happening now. Its what people would do if we had the choice. Many would buy drugs on Amazon if they listed ounces of weed or MDMA made by Roche or Cocaine HCL which would be fantastic but we would be doing 5mg bumps of it up each nostril. That pure coke, once sold in the UK, would be safer than alcohol. Sadly, due to the fact some people are stupid, or naive or have no scales, the morgues would have a few victims. But we got that with weed killer and nobody says shit about about how weed killer tastes sweet. Something that kills kids, should taste like absolute shit. Then they would not drink it. Methadone is the legal offering given to heroin abusers. That kills children but its legal so the people who make it are safe. But someone selling hash here is not safe. <br /><br />People have always used drugs. They always will use drugs. Drugs grow naturally. We have used them for thousands of years. Now we jail people for doing what might be in our very DNA. Maybe we need drugs. The law agrees and gives us a few drugs to use. But we are bored with alcohol and tobacco. They are dangerous things. legal but they kill thousands every years. Maybe thousands per week. Who cares? But if they died on illegal drugs it would be in the papers. Dying of alcohol aged under 50 is acceptable. Dying of heroin, we cannot prosecute the dead but we would see an article because heroin deaths are pretty rare. There would be no heroin deaths or very very few if heroin was legal. We could all get addicted if it was cheap enough and lab grade. Would not even be noticed by work colleagues. Many H addicts with high end jobs can be healthy because they know basic chemistry and spend on chemicals and lab equipment to clean it up. <br /><br />MDMA is safer than peanuts if the user takes a mini dose of 5mg to test if they have a one in ten million or more chance of being allergic to MDMA. Most so called MDMA deaths do not have a coroner test for legal chemicals that might be added to fake E pills. Some kid takes a pill made by gangsters, and MDMA is blamed for the death. Other times people drink too much water or too little, and die. Simple thing but because E is illegal nobody really knows much. We know about alcohol units but not how many mg of E one might take if one wanted to imbibe of that drug. Its why people die or get fucked up because they don&#039;t know about serotonin levels depleted not being replaced. People build up a tolerance for drugs so I just use lots of drugs but seldom. I could take a drug once a month but take another drug once a month till I have 30 drugs I am using, and I&#039;m not addicted to any because if you can wait 30 days for a bit of coke or even H, you are not an addict or abuser. I use LSD once a year maybe, mushrooms a few. They grow in local fields. We pick them. We used to sell at festivals years ago. We earned enough to buyt more drugs, booze and to make a play for some chicks when we were single and free! <br /><br />Fuck me, I&#039;ve written the articles meat, so pay up or don&#039;t quote me.<br /><br />All serious journalists get expenses. I&#039;m not writing for free if its published and earning you a wage. Steal my words and your not a gent, just a hack journo who would sell his own soul for a headline. If so, we will publish your article and name and shame you. I respect your right to do your job but I&#039;m in work now and if I got caught I&#039;d be in trouble. So, I&#039;m not some beggar, I&#039;m a worker who works just like you.<br /><br />So pay up or research for a few days or weeks. Use my words or even twist them cleverly and use flase IDs, even rejoining and quoting me, I&#039;ll spot that. I read a lot. We get every paper in my places office. We got the digital subs also with some workers so we copy that.&nbsp; ;) I do buy papers, but only ones with long words and crosswords Daily Mirror readers are never going to finish in a million years!<br /><br />Thanks to SR, DPR is like 3o guys and a few chicks! He is legion! Actually, its me, I&#039;m DPR, so make that 50 BTC and we can talk via tor mail, type in Tor mail dot org into the Tor search Sign up and keep the user and password safe. I can send encrypted messages and get you an interview with a vendor for an extra 50 BTC, its a fair bit of expenses cash but it will be a great article. <br /><br />I got DPR&#039;s back covered. He will say that if he reads this and appears for us, like the Queen on the balcony to wave to the fans or followers!<br /><br />So, I&#039;m DPR or will tell you what he does but will have to disguise him so I will have to tell white lies. I cannot say how old my buddy SPR is or what his job used to be before he retired from that to do this. <br /><br />He was going to sell me SR but I though he asked too much, I aint got £2,000,000. Or was the 2,0000,000 bitcoins?<br /><br />Anyway, pay me, or take the time off to read SR. It will take weeks. How much time you got for this article?<br /><br />And for those who think I&#039;m wrong for selling the basic truth of SR, face up to it, SR is news, and there is nothing anyone here can do to stop it. However, journalists can be sympathetic to people who break laws. Journalists will buy from SR and not just to send off to a drug testing center to authenticate the article. If SR gets the middle classes and richer young movers and shakers in sympathy with DPR, SR and Red (I&#039;m in here also, the very bread on the table for DPR!!)<br /><br />So my story is my story. Free to all SR members who buy and review drugs! Not free to people who might earn more in year than I do in 5. Its that simple. I&#039;ve done the story, you got editors who can agree expenses. I buy legal drugs and smoke hash in Holland when I work or visit. I am not some addict begging for coin. I have NEVER asked anyone here for credit apart from asking one guy if it was possible to get a small sample. I am a buyer. SR exists due to market demand. <br /><br />Your boss pays you and nobody asks what you spend the coin on. I promise you this, that coin will be spent on computer equipment. I need a fancy new hard drive. I need to buy a Linux security disc and USB set up as I might be selling bitcoins. That is legal. And I don&#039;t ask or care what people spend it on. <br /><br />Thanks DPR for backing the Red to earn coin to put bread on my table in mu house if this guy pays up!<br /><br />Or, pay me yourself, I&#039;ll do you justice and am not some coked up lunatic or using any stimulants at work. <br /><br />Should have been a night off but its so easy I&#039;m writing this in work because none of the guys like to miss out on the easy nights when we sit around and maybe move a few things about to make it look as if we have been busy. Scrape some walls, maybe report broken machinery because busy workers can have breaks. Also, pretend to be tired when the big boss comes in. He mostly plays golf and I know he snorts cocaine, but not that often. He mainly lives elsewhere, and has some Polish women, who is also rich, so at least is is safe there!<br /><br />Wish I\ was rich. <br /><br />Hence the journalists fee.<br /><br />DPR is cool, he earns every last bitcoin or they earn every last bitcoin.<br /><br />Tor, all that, I use it all, Linux, Linux flavors, and want the shit off here but its 10 BTC and I&#039;m not paying that for some software But, I would if some else paid me to buy it and preferred I spent my coin on legal goods to cover them. <br /><br />No pay mo quote. Not one word! Takes hundreds of hours on SR to know what this is all about. I have been here for hundreds of hours and dealt with many vendors. Not lost one package with my 40 plus buys or any of the 4 or so samples I won off new vendors who give samples for free like they do at the supermarket or a new cake shop opening. <br /><br />Pay me or else research or pay one. No fucking way would I let my labour&nbsp; be exploited.<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t been here too long, a couple of months so far, but I have to say that every media article I&#039;ve seen about SR demonizes the site and is somewhat contradictory to what I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; I think Guru summed it up when he said that journalists need to sell their publications. Dishing out what people expect to hear in a brief, fairly misleading article is sure-fire. All media pieces go like this:<br /><br />The setup:<br />&quot; .. can you believe there is a public place where anyone can buy DRUGS on the Interweb !!! .. &quot;<br /><br />The scare:<br />&quot; ... online sales are expanding rapidly .. who knows what is being sold !! ... &lt;a general insinuation that since CHILDREN are capable of going online, this could affect them&gt;&nbsp; <br /><br />The drama<br />&quot; ... law enforcement agencies seem helpless to stop it !!...&nbsp; all transactions use a mysterious currency called BITCOINS .. nobody knows who these vendors are .. could be your neighbor!&quot;<br /><br />The wise journalist ending<br />&quot; .. times have certainly changed let&#039;s hope law enforcement can change with them.&quot;<br /><br />In my humble opinion we should ignore media requests for opinions as what will eventually come out will be sensational, glib, misleading and predictable. Let the curiousguy draw his own conclusions based on what he reads here.

				I don&#039;t know what everybody has against reporters. Investigative journalists doing things that put innocent people are risk? Bad. Propagandists workings by proxy for the state? Bad. Real journalists? Good, and a respectable career at that.

				It&#039;s not that I have a problem with journalists themselves - I read quite a lot of news media and generally I trust what they do (although s a lot of the time you have to read between the lines).<br />It&#039;s the fact that SR is such a juicy &quot;article&quot; for commenting on. I believe that it&#039;s too much for most journalists to simply report on the simplicity of it. What I&#039;ve read about SR is sensational and misleading in a bid to appear &#039;sexy&#039; and sell magazines. The fact is that what happens here is quite humdrum - you place an order, it comes, you go about your day-to-day business and life moves on. The forum here is a community like many others on-line, the only difference is that we talk openly about what is still illegal in most countries. Bringing a lot of sensational attention to the site can&#039;t be very good as ultimately some government somewhere will declare it public enemy #1 and we could see a lot more LE infiltration. <br /><br />Those are my thoughts.

				So my whole point was that as soon as mainstream media start to write about SR, the attention it gets probably does more harm than good for our community and that’s due to the sensationalism that accompanies this new way of doing shady business. It’s my belief that until attitudes in the western world change we will be vilified; indeed some of us will be crucified on the altar of ‘justice’. The more SR is exposed to mom and pop who read the morning paper (or even GQ), the more politicians are going to want to make examples of us ‘evil-doers’.<br /><br />I’m saying that collectively we should probably just keep things quiet and enjoy what is here. Some people may disagree. It may be said that we should fight to change our image to be more positively reflected in the media. That may be right, but I don’t think that that is a winning fight just yet; it’s more of a battle, and to bring it to our doorstep … well, soldiers fall in battle.<br /><br />I appreciate OzFreelancer’s point of view about re-educating and legalization, but I don’t agree with using SR as a media tool in that debate. SR is an open forum for anybody that knows how to get here so anybody can write anything they want about it I suppose. I for one won’t be making the job of reporting it easy for the journalists.<br /><br />Anyway, I certainly didn’t mean to offend you Moksha. I can assure you that I’m not angry at OzFreelancer and I’m not lacking in mental capacity although it was a bit harsh of you to lash out that way.<br />

				OzFreelancer, What was it that you heard me say?&nbsp; I stand by my observation that what I read in most media outlets is simplistic and misleading. Prohibition in the US ended not because of great media debate on the steps of a bootlegger outfit, but because it just wasn&#039;t workable. I think we both agree that the current laws are dated and non-functional, where we disagree is the best method of instigating change. BTW – I can’t believe that it’s only been a month since I registered on SR, seems longer. Anyway to answer your question a friend told me about SR, she mentioned that a relative had used it. Funny though because she needed help setting up and funding a bitcoin wallet. I helped her do that and then got involved myself.<br /><br />Moksha – No offence taken. If I’m up all night I turn into a cranky mess. I know that my parents are completely anti-drug, like weed and heroin is the same thing – we’ll all jump off buildings and shoot nuns dead if we’re ‘high’. Trying to get them to approach recreational drug usage as anything other than pure evil is pretty much not going to happen. They would close down SR and jail everyone on it in a heartbeat. The thing is that they’re not alone, most older people I know of equate drugs with Satan; almost no amount of education or temperament will change their minds. <br />

And as for £3.85 for a half g of H, how the fuck did they work that price out? Wish I was buying my Btc at that price! <br />Reassuring to know that “Royal Mail has a range of measures in place to identify illegal items being sent through the postal system and works closely with the police and other authorities to prevent such activities from happening.” who are they kidding?!

				I also don&#039;t understand the animosity toward reporters.&nbsp; I argue that publicity can do more good than harm, and that we should want the public to see this place.&nbsp; I want the public to start associating places like the Road with calm, professional, sustainable and orderly market actions, instead of violently dangerous street-level market-driven warfare.&nbsp; We can do a lot toward this end by presenting a calm and professional front advocating the strengths of this place instead of its weaknesses.&nbsp; Reporters being able to report that places like these are full of repellant assholes is harming our cause.&nbsp; It&#039;s in our interest for them to see us as approachable, normal people with careers and productive impacts on society when we are done minding our own business in our own homes.<br /><br />I even recommend we start a separate forum specifically for the professional interfacing of our more mature users with reporters--the people who will be carrying our message back across the confusing barriers of tor and into the realm of the non-technical public.

				What kind of stupid questions are those?<br />it all seems directed on how LE and Gov should contrast SR...<br />If a journalist would write something objective about SR and this community he could do it just using his intellect, as long as he has one....<br />&nbsp;Actually i came in contact with SR trough a nice tv program wich is aired every week in Holland, is called Spuiten and Slikken and it talks about drugs and sex and stuff like that but in a very Dutch way!for example they test the different effect of the drugs on themselfs, they do reports about the purity of the drugs around but always in a non prohibitionist way, even if the stuff they use and test and talk about is illegal, they do it with doctors and scientists is really really nice. In the episode about silk road they were getting some DMT, but they were talking about it in the way it should, like a good thing for buyers and vendors, a nice way to get quality substaces but without go too much into particulars if you get what i mean..

				The mirror doesn&#039;t know the difference between the deep web and the dark nets. The deep web consists of all the sites not indexed by search engines like Google. The extremely vast majority of it is not illegal, and boring as fuck. The darknet consists of networks like Tor I2P and Freenet. It is not 100-200 times bigger than the rest of the internet.

I know for a fact they&#039;re here, but I am just a seldom user.<br />2. Bitcoins.<br />3. Nothing.<br />4. Of course it is. No violence, no getting screwed, payment is in escrow. Reviews even which act as a sense of security and quality control. People say &quot;how can you trust someone to send you drugs on the internet!?&quot;, and that confuses me. Maybe because I don&#039;t do hard drugs but I&#039;ve still met my fair share of shady dealers in real life. If you use your head and read reviews and forums it&#039;s hard to imagine anyone getting screwed,&nbsp; more so than in real life, since that is the question. It&#039;s funny isn&#039;t it? How this process lowers the risk, the violence, the death, the shady businesses yet the charges are what is different, the charges are much more severe that just getting caught on the street in real life. I don&#039;t know who is sending me drugs but I can read 100 people that say he is legit, real life dealers are usually met through 1, ONE, mutual friend that probably met him from basically out of no where.<br /><br />The only negative are the charges being more safe about it bring.
