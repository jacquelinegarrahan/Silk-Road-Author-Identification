				I was wondering if anyone else uses a VM for&nbsp; TOR and SR activity? I am using Linux Mint running in a Parallels VM. I have read that you shouldn&#039;t have a non TOR-ified browser open while using TOR, so I probably shouldn&#039;t even have a browser open in another VM or on my Mac?

I am using Linux Mint running in a Parallels VM. I have read that you shouldn&#039;t have a non TOR-ified browser open while using TOR, so I probably shouldn&#039;t even have a browser open in another VM or on my Mac?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well technically you can have a non-TORified browser open while browsing on TOR and still maintain anonymousity on TOR. This gives you the advantage of being able to browse a non-torified browser for your everyday non-sketchy, Internet activities, such as chatting on Facebook, while you simultaneously have a TOR browser open.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t compromise your security UNLESS you accidentally copy and pasted an .onion link onto the non-TOR-ified browser or if you accidentally copied a non-TORified link into your TOR browser...that might reveal your IP address. This, by the way, isn&#039;t a well known security flaw of TOR browser, so I would suspect many TOR users, who run a non-TOR-ified browser on at the same time as their TOR browser , already&nbsp; made this mistake thus compromising their security.&nbsp; You should check this link out for verification of this fact:<br /><br />&nbsp;How to Properly Set Up a Virtual Machine (VM) <br /><br />http://f3ew3p7s6lbftqm5.onion/text/torguide_v1_0_1.txt<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> The second issue is that of human error. Even if you have TOR installed, you may accidentally forget which browser to put in<br />a link. You may also accidentally click on a link from another program, such as a chat program. That program might then load<br />the link you clicked on into a non-TOR browser. When you are using TOR, you must be careful *constantly* that every link<br />goes into the right browser, and that you do not accidentally click the wrong link.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The MORAL OF THE STORY: don&#039;t accidentally copy and paste links from your TOR-browser into a non-TORified browser and vice versa. I hope this was great help to you.

This has been covered in the forum in a thread previously, just ran out of time to look for you. As explained by Pine in her tutorial below, a VM should be used to download files and use them without worrying about some possible Law Enforcement malware concealed within.<br /><br />https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=39320.0<br /><br />As posted by another very knowledgeable member, kmfkewm, he details his thoughts on the issue of opening up an O/S in a virtual environment.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8524.msg84755#msg84755<br /><br />There is lots of info on this forum concerning these topics should you want more.&nbsp; :)<br />
