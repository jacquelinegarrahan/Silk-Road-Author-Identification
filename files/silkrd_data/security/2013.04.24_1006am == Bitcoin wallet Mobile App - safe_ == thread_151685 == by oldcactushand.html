				The demise of instawallet has left me a confused and ignorant mess, desperate to purchase drugs online but too goddamn stupid to work out what the hell i&#039;m meant to do.<br /><br />That might be a slight overstatement. But the wallet/BTC/anonymity bullshit confuses me. I think the main problem is that I don&#039;t really understand the context in which LE would try and trace this stuff. But that&#039;s my problem, and I should do some reading I guess. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen people talk about btc-e. I signed up, but then it was being really glitchy when I was signing in for the 2nd time, so I&#039;m gonna leave that one. I&#039;ve also got a wallet on blockchain, which seems fine, but it&#039;s also glitchy as hell on my phone (which I need to use because of the way in which I buy BTC... I&#039;m in the UK).<br /><br />So there&#039;s these wallet applications for mobile phones. Is it okay to use that, and then send the bitcoin to my SR account using my phone?<br /><br />I&#039;m only buying personal amounts here, so I don&#039;t need to go absolutely ridiculous on anonymity, but I&#039;d also like to know I&#039;m not doing something stupid, or if there are clear downsides to doing things this way. Would it be better to use blockchain (I would still be using it on my phone)? I&#039;ll be buying coins today and probably using the mobile app if I&#039;m not told to do otherwise. The fact that seemingly half of SR uses their bank account to purchase coins does make me feel better about my ignorance, though.<br /><br />Sorry to clog up forum with another one of these threads, but I&#039;m hoping to buy coins in a couple of hours and just want a quick answer. Thanks.<br />
