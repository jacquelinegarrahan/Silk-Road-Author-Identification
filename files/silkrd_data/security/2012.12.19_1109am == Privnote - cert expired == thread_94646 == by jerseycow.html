				I agree with you, Wadozo.&nbsp; If I was a vendor, I would refuse to click every single privnote link I was presented with and give whoever sent it a talking to. I&#039;ve even had to specifically request that vendors refrain from sending me info through privnote, vendors with 100% ratings - wtf privnote isn&#039;t that much easier than gpg is it? <br /><br />I think someone should start a inquisition to fight against the heretics of gpg - we&#039;ll see how popular privnote is when using it will get you burned at the stake! (which it almost could in a worst-case-senerio already)<br />

Javascript can be easily exploited . By using Privnote, the information you send is stored on a 3rd party server, opening up possible scenarios involving your sensitive info falling into the wrong hands, which could all be avoided by using PGP.
