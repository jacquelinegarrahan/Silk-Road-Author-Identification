				Dwolla is just a simple ACH middle man.<br />You ACH to their bank account, they hold it, and then pretend to transfer to another user in their internal system.<br />They keep holding the funds in a centralized account and whenever that other user wants to cash out they ACH the money to him.<br /><br />Any fool can set up their own Dwolla. The guy who invented it is some tool from Iowa who is getting sued galore right now for basically being a complete asshat and ninja editing their Terms of Service after all the fraudsters discovered how easy it is to use. I bet they disappear soon.<br /><br />Because it&#039;s based on banks using methods anybody can fraud you need ID. This is quite normal.<br />Cash deposit using bitinstant probably way to go. Sure it costs an extra 5% but is generally anonymous. Better if you find somebody local on bitcointalk forums and just give them cash in hand to get bitcoins there are enough users now to do this in every major city

				There&#039;s no harm in using your real identification and information on Dwolla or MtGox given you have a legitimate legal reason for buying bitcoins ( buying them for other people and keeping a % profit like all bitcoin suppliers do )

				Yes indeed, I buy Bitcoins on MtGox using my own bank account, and redeem USD codes and transfer them doing the same. There are perfectly legal reasons to use Bitcoin!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18037.msg181593#msg181593">Quote from: Veetano on April 08, 2012, 03:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There&#039;s no harm in using your real identification and information on Dwolla or MtGox given you have a legitimate legal reason for buying bitcoins ( buying them for other people and keeping a % profit like all bitcoin suppliers do )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
