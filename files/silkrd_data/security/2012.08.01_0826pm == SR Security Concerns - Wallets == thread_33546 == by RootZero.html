				This follows on from my discussion here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32788.0<br /><br />My understanding is SR doesn&#039;t do anything to anonymise incoming coins. So it is easy for anyone to trace btc from an exchange to SR.<br /><br />Services like Bitcoinfog have been suggested as a solution.<br /><br />Just think its important that anyone funding their SR wallet be aware it could be potentially traced. Since most exchanges accept bank transfers this is the biggest risk. Even making cash deposits concerns me as I think most exchanges ban or block people using tor so will have a record of your IP, also traceable.<br /><br />Any experts feel free to discuss...

The tumbler sends all payments through a complex, semi-random series of dummy transactions, each with a new, one-use receiving address, making it nearly impossible to link your payment with any coins leaving the site. The quantity, frequency, and number of transactions are all varied chaotically in a way that mimics the transactions of the Bitcoin economy as a whole. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

The rest of the world can only see that funds went from one address to another, but not that it is SR. <br /><br />A mixer for between seller and buyer is nice. Because if the seller gets busted, police might find his BTC address. Then, using the block chain, they can trace the funds back all the way to the MtGox account of the buyer. The BTC mixer makes this impossible.<br /><br />However, a mixer for incoming BTC would do nothing extra. Because nobody knows that the address it&#039;s going to, is SR.

You&#039;ll profit a lot from that.<br /><br />My opinion is that as a buyer, you do not need to use bitcoin fog. Silk Road&#039;s own tumbler provides adequate security, and it is not necessary to launder coins going to an SR wallet.&nbsp; No need to waste 2% of your funds on Bitcoin Fog.

				eJ3k1--Thanks for the reply and your comment.<br /><br />So, I can just transfer my funds str to SR from bitinstant? Is that correct?<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing this should be safe as long as it&#039;s done using a dummy laptop on a public connection and not a home PC to be super clean?

And you can anonymise your connection to clearweb sites with tor. No need for a throwaway laptop or public connection.

				Just curious, think a lot about ways to improve my security and anonymity, I&#039;ve heard so many views on this and getting my head round it as a noob to crypto-currencies.<br /><br />So if you direct transfer to SR from an exchange they can tell its a SR wallet address? <br />But they cant trace the coins to their destination or link any particular purchase to me?<br /><br />Is it possible to route a bitcoin wallet client through tor? Then that wallet would be untraceable? Could imagine that being very slow if even safe?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure mtGox and other UK exchanges say they will ban you if you access the site through tor, so its easy for them to keep records of ip addresses immediately linked to the original coins?

There are some like Bosshogg who do not charge commission. I have never bought coins any other way than through the MP converters.
