				Hey,<br /><br />How safe would it be to browse SilkRoad on an Android device (phone and Nexus 7 tablet) which both contain a sim card as well (I&#039;d be using WiFi but as it&#039;s going through Tor anyway that shouldn&#039;t make a difference)? I mean, obviously I&#039;d be safe from traffic analysis thanks to Tor on Android (Orbot + Orweb) however if there&#039;s anything sitting on my device that collects data, we all know Google like to harvest data about their users (to what extent though?), and many apps require permissions that could allow them to keylog or screencap etc, like a virus.<br /><br />How secure really is Android, and how much data do Google really collect from their users? Enough to be able to profile and confirm a SilkRoad user? Obviously they wouldn&#039;t take any action I&#039;m sure, lol... It&#039;s just the thought of... Unmasking your anonymity when using this site<br /><br />Was just curious on what everyones thoughts are on this matter. Am I thinking too far in to it or is it good to be overly concerned about your privacy when using this site?<br /><br />Would / do you browse SR on an Android / iOS device for that matter?

				Do you mean just look and hang in the forum? I wouldn&#039;t do business on an Android phone or tablet. <br /><br />As far as I know you can&#039;t do pgp encryption on it yet and A lot of devices can&#039;t be completely encrypted. <br /><br />Hopefully someone will give you a better more definitive answer. <br /><br />My best advise is you would be better off getting a cheap laptop than use an Android to shop on the road.<br /><br />My bad. I might be wrong about the inability to do complete pgp encryption on a Droid. Just read a thread where people say is possible. I still think it is safer to use a lap top to transact business here.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yea if you are just browsing you should be ok. You could even post to forums with your phone/tablet using tor orbot or FireFox. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t know if it is a good idea to buy or sell. But sounds like blackfidora has a way. It would be interesting to hear what his method is. I didn&#039;t know there was a way to safely use Droid or Iphones here. <br /><br />Since there probably are people using phones and tablets any way so they should be as safe as possible.
