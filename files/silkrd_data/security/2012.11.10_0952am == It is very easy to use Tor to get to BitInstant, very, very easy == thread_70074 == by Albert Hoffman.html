				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BitInstant, or any other web site for that matter, that appears to be incompatible with Tor, really is not.&nbsp; Access is blocked because he web site blocks a list of known Tor Exit Nodes.&nbsp; So, the problem becomes: How do we use Tor to visit BitInstant, or any other site, without BitInstant, or any other site, knowing that we are using Tor?&nbsp; In other words: How do we use Tor and cloak it at the same time?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, I have no idea.&nbsp; Just kidding, of course.&nbsp; We cloak Tor by exiting Tor through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and then connect to BitInstant, etc.&nbsp; There are hard ways to do this and there are easy ways to do this, we will use the easy way, to wit:<br /><br />1. Get Tor up and running and then connect to BitInstant, note that you are blocked as usual.<br /><br />2. Go to the following web site: https://pierce-traffic.cyberghostvpn.com/go/browse.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zipzapinc.om&amp;b=1<br /><br />3. In the yellow box that comes up, paste the BitInstant URL into the white box in the middle.&nbsp; Ignore any error message that might be above the white box.<br /><br />4. Uncheck the boxes except the cookie box.<br /><br />5. Press GO.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are now exiting Tor into a VPN and then to BitInstant,&nbsp; Bit Instant can no longer see Tor.&nbsp; That&#039;s it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I would like to hear more from a member with more than 1 post :D. Does accessing this VPN compromise anonymity in any way??

				And, while we&#039;re at it- you can avoid all of this by simply going to a public wi-fi hotspot like a Starbuck&#039;s to process your bitinstant ticket.<br /><br />And, since my local processing lcation is still not requiring ID, I can still use an alias and am still anonymous. It&#039;s not a huge deal like everyone thinks. Bitinstant is just covering their own ass.

				Hell Yeah Al. You&#039;re fuckin awesome. If I could give you karma I would. I&#039;m an extremely cautious man and not being able to aquire BTC with total anonymity from start to finish was pissing me off. Until I read your post I was going settle on buying btc&nbsp; through the clearnet then launder it through my torrified wallet and my blockchain wallet, which I&#039;m guessing would take much longer. Thanks again for your post&nbsp; I tried it and your method definitely works, I woulda never found that ghost site on my own. BTW anyone have any thoughts on my btc scheme: Getting a cash deposit slip from Bitinstant through Tor, taking the slip to a bank branch to pay&nbsp; (by send to wallet address option, blockchain wallet, accessed through tor), then bouncing the btc from blockchain to SR. Anyone think it would be worth the extra time to transfer the btc from the blockchain wallet to the torrified and encrypted &quot;vanilla&quot; wallet on my computer then to SR for the extra security? Will the bank ask for ID when I pay? If I have to show ID then I would definitely launder it this way. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated I have yet to make my first purchase and I want to perfect my scheme in regards to security before I do. Also I&#039;ve gotten the hang of PGP and if there&#039;s any other noobs out there who want to practice it, feel free to PM me (include your public key if you want me to reply with&nbsp; an encrypted message, so you can practice decrypting) Here&#039;s my public key:<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFCawRkBCAC286RO/zhl/6CAK5UCsZRU71k4UqRQDl8LwFrTETI/+CKN1j6q<br />dzPE+efHIZEkb5v0npp0AAryw+WUNTxCz/uaGaXIbFnhG+NvAvSECslpUtQov3xU<br />MbbQYeSTn8m6aOhoH8AP5AZr/S02kPMUNFyu6VGuWu3V3U7A6sQ9nqRwhbNHLDqd<br />wcPA2lAccV8b6pmcWbV7Hu3QqhHoiV4uvu8cq0FbMJaxT3+LC6QChwPDLAarJidF<br />7rpMshwQ/bnQNET1N8IEIOpdqIISgIAsvHYfmRBQcvltAcpqtTfD1xGNEfCnSLMB<br />w04HM05FgUmFzhh2+h0qOvYVFgWHYj7l3559ABEBAAG0PkpvaG4gR2FsdHNvbiAo<br />b2ZmaWNpYWwgZm9ydW0gY29yci4ga2V5KSA8b3ZhbHRpbmVAdG9ybWFpbC5vcmc+<br />iQE4BBMBAgAiBQJQmsEZAhsPBgsJCAcDAgYVCAIJCgsEFgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRAN<br />tWgewlrCTYRHB/9zycn+dJjHHxi9Nzw6K8WK78zZYFULGl7YlyW5K5mlovjvjyGV<br />aDl/GNx4FiLEvO9s7irrrpL961tVpZfca4j7Uk/d0nC4mEvo9qJfuI4ODLC5Ssnh<br />1ZC8OPgcuxuiBSGW7m5N08k5/uZ2pGQp9XfdsBmDUcQiJfCgZt17JhgZZMQxzFuY<br />W0ype1iyOHD76JBi+HglSS7pBHlStleYUbxYYPN/RqJjF1XHSqwvbWWnPFJsiZsR<br />C4357zBPMk3TFQfvC1uY4cbXMvxHoJG8zzZ8puMiVzX+6gDlZd/rvQhLI47+Yu5S<br />Qrka+8D38rXBnF43FK1Btt1HwkTTxk6A+R8j<br />=ACTp<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				There&#039;s still some issues with this though. <br /><br />1). Can&#039;t access the cash deposit options<br /><br />2). Even if this fully worked. How would the VPN handle lauching zipzap and cashpayment.com? Wouldn&#039;t they not work?<br /><br />****Making orders of this way doesn&#039;t work. If anyone can get it to work, let us know. <br /><br />

				Yes, none of the Pay from cash deposit options (Moneygram, CVS, Walmart, etc.) are available for some reason.
