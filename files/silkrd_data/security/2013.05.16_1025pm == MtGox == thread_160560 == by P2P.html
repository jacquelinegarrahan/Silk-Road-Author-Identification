				So am I not able to buy/sell btc on MtGox through tor? I am trying and it seems as though nothing is happening, likely because JS is not enabled. I remember being able to buy/sell just recently though, so I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. Can someone steer me in the right direction as far as using my MtGox account through Tor?

				I havent used mtgox myself (there always seems to be easier alternatives for where i live)<br />but as far as i understand they dont allow you to conduct your business through tor to prevent illicit activity&nbsp; ::)<br />don&#039;t quote me on it but i think they have blacklisted people who have tried in the past

				If you access your Mt.Gox account using Tor they will flag you for verification meaning that you won&#039;t be able to withdraw either your money or your Bitcoin until you satisfy their AML / KYC requirements; basically verifying your identity.<br /><br />Libertas

If you don&#039;t like it there are plenty of other businesses you can conduct your business through (the foundations of a free market which i hope we are all striving for).&nbsp; :)

				And now this private company has my money tied up (basically stealing). Oh well. And I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been flagged. I didn&#039;t get any notification as such.

				Sorry for going off topic for a second, but I would like to suggest some protocols for thread naming. MtGox makes it harder to distinguish from the many other threads about MtGox, as, for example, &quot;I can&#039;t seem to access MtGox through Tor,&quot; or MtGox and Tor,&quot; anything to explain the thread better. No offense to the OP, just making what I think would be a helpful suggestion. <br /><br />Cheers
