				I tried Liberte but couldn&#039;t get it to work past the boot screen. I&#039;ve successfully started using Tails.<br /><br />I understand that there is no possible way to save any changes to data in Tails.<br /><br />While this is great for the purpose of plausible deniability, it presents serious functionality issues. <br /><br />I&#039;m considering creating an encrypted volume containing incriminating files, uploading it to Tormail as an attachment, then downloading and decrypting it when necessary. I might also upload small programs as attachments.<br /><br />-What would you do?<br />-So, just to be sure, there is no possible way for LEO to recover incriminating data if that data was created inside Tails before the USB running Tails was removed from the computer?<br />-I need each of the following. It must be small enough to upload to Tormail, meaning less than 5 megabytes each:<br />-----1. A random password generator<br />-----2. PGP (TAILS&#039; DEFAULT PGP APP WILL NOT DO, I can&#039;t get the app to open)<br />-----3. A properly configured browser with bookmarks, login data, and proper proxy settings.<br />-----4. A MAC address changer.<br />-----5. A compression/decompression program.<br />-----6. An app for handling spreadsheets and word processing, preferably compatible with Microsoft Office files.<br />-----7. I also need a program like Truecrypt that works while occupying less than 5 megabytes and without&nbsp; &nbsp;undergoing an installation process.<br /><br />I only use random passwords and never use the same password twice. I can&#039;t imagine myself reinstalling several programs every time I need to do a few simple tasks. <br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				1. https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm<br />2. Use gedit(Applications -&gt; Accessories)...on tails it already has the PGP plugin.<br />3. Don&#039;t need that, can&#039;t get that. Just save links in a text file on an encrypted volume. Hell encrypt it with a passphrase if you want (the default pgp app will do for this!)<br />4. Check Tails documentation, you do this on boot.<br />5. Do you really want to install a program every time you boot? Is the default not enough? I am just not understanding the need...<br />6. Tails has openoffice, Applications -&gt; Office<br />7. Tails has cryptkeeper, Applications -&gt; System Tools

				Truecrypt and Tails<br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index.en.html<br /><br />You can export - import bookmarks in Midori, somewhere in &quot;all bookmarks&quot; (sorry but I don&#039;t have Midori right now)<br /><br />Should come in handy (got PeaZip and other utilities, but Tails really have no tar?):<br />http://portablelinuxapps.org/

				Tails should have come with tar.&nbsp; It&#039;s a compression program.&nbsp; In a terminal window type the following:<br /><br />tar --help
