				hey peoples<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to setup a tor relay using the browser bundle. I think its working as I get the message saying its &quot; connected to the directory blah blah - excellant&quot;<br /><br />Problem is.....I&#039;m not 100% sure on the port forwarding that is required.<br />I&#039;m using port 9001 as the tor relay port, the directory port is&nbsp; 9030 and tor control is localhost:9050. All the tutorials I&#039;ve read say you need to port forward diff ports.. <br /><br />Do I just need to port forward the tor relay, which in my case is 9001 ?<br /><br />Also some docs have the tor relay as 9001 and others as 443, Does it matter what I use ? I&#039;m assuming what ever port I use is updated in the directory so others can reach me.. as long as its port forwarded and has connectivity ?<br /><br />any other useful tips and tricks would be great :)<br /><br />thanks

				You shouldn&#039;t run a relay from home, because<br /><br />1. Residential connections are pretty slow to begin with.<br /><br />2. It destroys one of Tor&#039;s best features, concealing the fact that you use Tor. Your IP address will be in publicly accessible lists like http://torstatus.blutmagie.de<br /><br />3. Many web sites indiscriminately block all Tor relay IP addresses, irrespective of whether they are exit nodes, so you are likely to find your own web browsing to be blocked.<br /><br />However, I will answer your questions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210197.msg1518106#msg1518106">Quote from: jase00 on September 05, 2013, 03:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hey peoples<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to setup a tor relay using the browser bundle.

If you allowed you relay to be a directory server, you should port forward 9030 as well.<br /><br />Check onion icon -&gt; Message Log -&gt; Advanced tab for messages about whether your relay is accessible by others. It does some self-testing.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also some docs have the tor relay as 9001 and others as 443, Does it matter what I use ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />443 is better because it&#039;s the standard HTTPS port so it&#039;s harder for censoring governments to block that port without breaking lots of web sites.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m assuming what ever port I use is updated in the directory so others can reach me.. as long as its port forwarded and has connectivity ?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s correct, although you may not see much traffic for a day or more, while clients are learning about your relay. You also might not see much traffic at all if your bandwidthrate is really low (like below 100 KB).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">any other useful tips and tricks would be great :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Rent a VPS. :)<br />

				thanks for the detailed info :) I wasn&#039;t planning on running it at home&nbsp; (just testing it quickly atm, through my &quot;prepaid&quot; 3G dongle, not my regular service ) but you did give me some extra points I wasn&#039;t aware of that I&#039;ll need to take into consideration.&nbsp; <br />The port 443 vs 9001 makes sense, If I do continue to play around with this I&#039;ll stick to 443. <br /><br />Interesting how it takes a day or so for people to connect.. I was waiting an hour for the directory to update and wondering why I couldn&#039;t see much activity.. guess that solves that :}<br /><br />thanks again !

				Right. If I lived in Big Brother land USA I would think twice before running a Tor relay from home while buying drugs. If you buy small amounts of drugs in most countries police won&#039;t even bother, unless they have no other choice. It&#039;s a lot of paper work and the prosecutor will drop charges. Well unless you live in Bavaria maybe. They&#039;d treat you like a terrorist when you get caught with 0.0001g of weed.
