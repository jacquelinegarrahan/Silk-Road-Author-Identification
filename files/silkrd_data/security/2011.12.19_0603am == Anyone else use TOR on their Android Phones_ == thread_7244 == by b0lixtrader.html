				I use TOR on my android and haven&#039;t had a problem. I share my wi-fi and rather not implicate my housemates if something bad happens, so I use my cell phone instead. A lot of people might feel it&#039;s a bad idea but anything involving the SR is risky.

				Whys that, the system seems pretty damn secure. And I haven&#039;t had any law enforcement walk to my house and I&#039;ve been using it for like a month just to browse and go on the forums.<br /><br />I also made some BTC transactions.

				I have tor on my phone, with a 4g phone, and SR is actually faster on my phone than on the PC (possibly because I route my pc through a proxy first).&nbsp; My phone is under a fake name and address with no contract. Granted it&#039;s not a disposable phone (was a $400 phone), but Sim cards can be disposable. Plus my phone is unlocked so I can just carrier rotate.

				I have an HTC and was running Tor on my phone.&nbsp; I was at work one day and wanted to get an order in so it would ship that day.&nbsp; I was able to do it but I was not able to encrypt using PGP.&nbsp; Is PGP available on Android?<br /><br />I found it very difficult and kind of slow but great in a bind.

				There&#039;s a program called &quot;Android PGP&quot; in the market. It&#039;s free and looks promising. The only thing is it seems it would be inconvenient since it only lets you choose to encrypt a file or encrypt an SMS message. I&#039;ll look into it more. <br /><br />I have used Orbot/Orweb a couple times just for messages when I was out and about without computer access; works great.

				i use AGP Android Privacy Guard for the pgp stuff, and InBrowser for the browser as it clears all data when exited (and of course OrBot). its best to root phone so that OrBot can be configured such that only InBrowser uses Tor and your normal browser/email etc. uses your normal internet.

				There&#039;s a lot of work that has to go into properly securing Tor on a desktop. Downloading and running the Vidalia/Aurora package from Tor is not enough. Any non-tor traffic leaks your IP address, which in turns leaks information about you. <br /><br />Personally, you couldn&#039;t pay me to run Tor on a mobile device. Even on a jailbroken iOS device there aren&#039;t enough security mechanisms in place to secure it to the same level as on a desktop.<br /><br />

				Those of you asking about the iPod/iPad app, I downloaded an app I found to my iPhone 4S, it&#039;s called &quot;Covert Browser&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically the same thing as TOR, but it&#039;s really pretty mediocre. You can access the Silk Road log in page, but you cannot log in or access Silk Road. You can browse the entirety of the Silk Road Forums, but you cannot log into them either, and you can&#039;t search anything. I just used it while I was gone to browse the forum because I was bored, but it&#039;s not really very useful since I can&#039;t log in or do anything.

				I see this people are talking about using an iPhone, I would strongly discourage this as it has been recently in the news that Apple provides backdoors for governments. I&#039;ve not looked into this indetail, just do a search for &quot;apple government backdoor&quot;.<br /><br />In my opinion, the safest way for mobile access is to use a custom firmware (see CynogenMod and similar) on an Android device, then use the software described in previous posts. These firmwares are much less likely to have backdoors in, and for the uber geek they can audit the code&nbsp; compile it themselves.<br /><br />fruity.

				Actually its pretty useful if you make sure only to connect via wi-fi it makes it much easier to use tor from a public wi-fi than to pull out a laptop where its much easier to see the screen. Would not recommend going through a cell network data connection due to possible traffic analysis. Make sure your mobile browser is properly configured to not save cookies, urls etc. <br />&nbsp;<br />I would recommend only doing this on a custom ROM no telling what the providers preload on the phones.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;re really careful/paranoid pop the sim out, use wifi, and re install the rom before putting sim back in, its a pretty fast process when you are used to it. There are also apps to check your phone to make sure spyware like carrieriq is not on the phone.

No method of connection is 100% foolproof or untrackable, just some food for thought on how to best connect via a handheld device. <br />I also forgot to suggest if you just buy a used phone off craigslist or similar for cash and use it wifi only there would be no record of you actually owning the phone in case it is found.
