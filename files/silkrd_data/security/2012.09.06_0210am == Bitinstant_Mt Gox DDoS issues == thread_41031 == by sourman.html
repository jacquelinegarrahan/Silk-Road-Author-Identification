				To those affected by tonight&#039;s bitinstant issues, they were supposedly caused by a DDoS attack which has now been resolved. Coins should start flowing within the next 3 hours or so.<br /><br />I knew there was trouble when gox wouldn&#039;t load earlier this evening :/

				Mt. Gox issued a statement:<br /><br />=====================<br />Outage Report - 2012/9/6<br /><br />Dear Mt.Gox users and the Bitcoin community:<br /><br />Yesterday, Mt.Gox suffered two different outages, preventing our customers to access the Mt.Gox website and making it impossible for people to trade via Mt.Gox user interface.<br /><br />While these outages have been handle swiftly, we would like to reassure our customers and the community that we did not suffer any breach and that no data or funds have been stolen on our server. Also, please find below the details on each outage and what has been done to resolve this matter.<br /><br />1. Prolexic Network Trouble.<br />While we have received all of the details on this matter, Prolexic suffered yesterday night (JST) due to some technical difficulties on its network, making it impossible for some people to access Mt.Gox website.<br /><br />We hope to provide you with more detailed information as soon as they are made available to us.<br /><br />2. SYN flood DOS Attack.<br />This morning around 6am to 7:15am (JST), Mt.Gox suffered another unrelated attack, preventing people to access and use Mt.Gox services. <br /><br />The person or group that targeted Mt.Gox used a SYN flood denial-of-service attack by sending a huge succession of SYN request on our servers in an attempt to consume all of our server resources. <br /><br />While our servers are equipped with adequate countermeasures for such attack, thanks to SYN cookies, our ISP networking infrastructure, including firewalls and routers, were not able to handle the sheer amount of packet (50,000 packets/sec) sent to our infrastructure, resulting in our system unresponsiveness to legitimate users.<br /><br />Once again, we would like to reassure everyone that our server did not suffer any breach and that all our customers&#039; data and funds are safe and accounted for.<br /><br />On Behalf of the entire Mt.Gox team, please accept our apologizes for any inconvenience that these two outages may have caused you.<br />=====================
