				Over the past few weeks, I have been putting various keyloggers onto systems with no protection. It has been fairly unsuccessful, as all I had managed to get was some facebook details and such, but I have just got the Debit card details from a person with no protection at all, and as far as I am aware is fairly old and inable to use a computer well. They put their card details onto Amazon, which doesn&#039;t require a CVC code, which means that I can&#039;t exactly do much with the card. But I am able to use the card on amazon though, so here&#039;s my question;<br />&nbsp; -How am I able to use this card? Is there a way to anonymously buy items through amazon?(Set up with false details on tor), I do not have a PO Box, So would have to get it sent to mine or a friends house.<br />&nbsp; -If not, is there a way I can use this card on another site to get money from it? I haven&#039;t found any websites that don&#039;t require a CVC code, and the keylogger no longer works so I can&#039;t carry on monitoring to get the CVC...<br /><br />Any advice would be great, as far as I am aware she is fairly old, so would not likely to have much knowledge of small payments,<br />Cheers,<br />Locker.

				Don&#039;t steal from people. This isn&#039;t a site for credit card theft.

				That&#039;s not a nice thing to do to your grandmother.<br /><br />Normally I think what people do is sell their details on the carding forums/sites. I think using a friend&#039;s address would be a very bad choice, it&#039;s likely the fraud will be discovered, and I&#039;m guessing they would be looking into where stuff got delivered or tried to be delivered. It might trigger some fraud alert on Amazon too, where a credit card already associated with another person&#039;s account gets used in a different account with a different ship to address, especially if it&#039;s a long way from the existing address and doesn&#039;t match the CC billing address.

				I have no clue who this person is haha, definitely not my grandmother...<br />And I have already been successful&nbsp; at adding it to my amazon account, but I still don&#039;t know what to do with it :/

Why don&#039;t you go over to one of the THIEF sites. They have forums like these i&#039;m sure.
