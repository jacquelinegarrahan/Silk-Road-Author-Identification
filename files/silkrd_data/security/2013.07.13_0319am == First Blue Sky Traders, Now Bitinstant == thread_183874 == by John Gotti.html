				They are. But we have 2 big advantages going for us as we try to get this going. <br />1) we&#039;ve decided to vacation outside of the US and while on vacation we are going to set this up. The down side of course being that this means a little extra mail time for anyone in the US. By a little extra I mean a few days at most. We&#039;re not talking mail to Cambodia or anything like that.<br />2) we are working without banks. Pros and Cons to that as well. As I said no bank transfers, but then again no one shutting you down. Also involves a hell of a lot of start up capital.. and maybe some bumps along the way of running out of btc if there is a sudden buy frenzy. <br /><br />Hard to try to be prepared for some of these possible problems.

				dudes, these trading exchanging sites such as bitisntant mtgox etc, make enormous amounts of money. The fact that in the whole world there are only a few, speaks by itself. <br />I think in the end , it all about monopoly and manipulation of the market. If you can only buy at MTgox, then you will.<br />These sites in my opinions are government &quot;legal&quot; internet gangsters.

				Yep...I&#039;m fucked...I did have a lot of fun, and I certainly won&#039;t buy any marijuana or hash on the street lvl ever again.&nbsp; I was spoiled here. I am just glad I got to be a part of it.

But we have 2 big advantages going for us as we try to get this going. <br />1) we&#039;ve decided to vacation outside of the US and while on vacation we are going to set this up. The down side of course being that this means a little extra mail time for anyone in the US. By a little extra I mean a few days at most. We&#039;re not talking mail to Cambodia or anything like that.<br />2) we are working without banks. Pros and Cons to that as well. As I said no bank transfers, but then again no one shutting you down. Also involves a hell of a lot of start up capital.. and maybe some bumps along the way of running out of btc if there is a sudden buy frenzy. <br /><br />Hard to try to be prepared for some of these possible problems.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) Good thinking. US is on a BTC-related business destruction rampage at the moment. Further from US your business is the better.<br /><br />2) This is interesting. So only cash in mail? Or do you plan on using WU or MG? <br /><br />This is true. It would be to your benefit to become better acquainted with some of the BTC &quot;supernodes&quot; as they call themselves. The original adopters who now sit on hundreds of thousands of BTC can make for great BTC reserve in a pinch.

				I&#039;m glad I bought a bunch at one time a while ago. But sucks that I&#039;ve lost money since the declined value of BTC.<br /><br />Oh well<br /><br />Blue Sky Traders was where I transacted and did business.

				Unfortunately the down side is keeping close to the US. In the geographical sense. At least with a few &quot;branches&quot;&nbsp; Simply required to keep shipping times down, or to allow for day trippers to make face to face exchanges. But by no means does this require a limit to near the US.<br /><br />For the time being the group feels cash is best, however I do see merit in other options and there is an open discussion about it. WU would be the second easiest option, at least I believe that. MM is something that is unfamiliar to myself and is hard for me to argue the merits of.
