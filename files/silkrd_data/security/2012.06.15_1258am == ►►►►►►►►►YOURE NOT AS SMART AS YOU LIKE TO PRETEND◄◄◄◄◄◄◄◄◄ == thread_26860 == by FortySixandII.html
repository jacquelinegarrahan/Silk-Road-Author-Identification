				Silk Road has been a great creation that has improved the lives of people, by allowing them easier access in freedom of exploration of themselves. However as this service grows, inevitably there will be more pressure from the powers that want to control.<br />People are going to get caught, and will have to deal with the clusterfuck of the justice system. <br /><br />I have seen many thread of people trying to justify to themselves and others of reasons to talk to the police, or come in for questioning. <br />If you&#039;re one of those people or someone who hasn&#039;t had to dealing with the justice system, please watch the following video in entirety, and pay attention!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc

				I really disagree with most of the things that were said in that video by the lawyer.

				The police just want a conviction. Everything they say is geared towards that. Cop pull over people and ask &#039;do you know what I hav pulled you over for&#039;. Why do they do that? Simple - the person who thinks being &#039;honest&#039; (most of us) is likely to say &#039;was it for speeding&#039; or whatever.<br /><br />So talking to the cops - sure you can talk to them, but you got to be very careful what you say! <br /><br />If caught with a lot of drugs cops will always ask for informants. <br /><br />In the UK we do not get so many people turning evidence because we do not get 30 years on 3 strikes and out policies which can see a man who lights up a joint in three wrong places end up in prison till he grows old.<br /><br />Its not so much talking to the police that is what matters, it is people in your life who may fold and inform on you. They are far worse than the cop who is just doing a job really. Some are assholes others might pull you up, find a few grams of pot, and tell you to keep away from heroin! Happened to me a few times. Small amounts. At that point it is worth communicating. If I had said &#039;no comment&#039; cop would arrest me. If I am polite to him and admit that it is weed (they are not stupid) a good chance I walk.<br /><br />but if caught with lots and lots/ Say nothing till the lawyers arrives. You may want to say &#039;I take tea with milk and 3 sugars.&#039;<br /><br />But if caught in the street with a small amount of drugs - don&#039;t be stroppy. Be polite. The cop might not fancy the paperwork and let you go. A buddy had one cop make him throw his out of the bag. Only a gram or so and he complied.<br /><br />Noyt talking to cops ever - might get you into more trouble. As for snitching that is just wrong. But if facing 30 years - many would rat you out. In fact many facing just a bit of time would rat you out. Don&#039;t ever deal in drugs IRL. There are so many snitches out there that anyone selling IRL will be marked. In my circles we only buy from people who we have known all our lives. We only dabble in weed so at most its a fine for the small amounts sold by friends to friends who may pass it on to others. <br /><br />SR is the ideal set up. No lines of people at your door!<br /><br />Had a mate who sold drugs IRL many moons ago tell me about a line of 50 people in a &#039;hash drought&#039;.<br /><br />On SR, the average vendors neighbors will not have a clue.<br /><br />A real drug dealer - has to be known to get established! How else will people know you sell? As you grow older you become more sensible and less risk is taken.<br /><br />The viideo I have not got time for but I think I seen it before - or similar - and its well worth a watch! <br /><br />There is an ex USA narc cop who makes a &#039;How not to get busted&#039; video also.<br /><br />Americans have rights on search and seizure. <br /><br />Obvious never get drawn into a conversation which might be used again you in a court of law!<br /><br />But if caught with a bag of weed - say something - because saying nothing will get you nicked when the cop would have let you walk.<br /><br />Good luck out there!<br /><br />And no - none of use are as smart as we pretend to be sometimes. <br /><br />most people don&#039;t pretend to be smart - they are just ignorant of the law. Same thing really.

				There was a case here with multiple kilos of coke. <br />Feds made arrests but miraculously nobody was talking, defying the game theory. So the police put them under custody for almost 2 years (which means prison here), took all their cash and cars, froze their bank accounts, along with their wife and parents bank accounts, closed family businesses, searched their houses and work places numerous times, lengthily interrogations, bad prison conditions, so eventually they started to talk.<br />Police can do a lot of bad things.<br /><br />There&#039;s even drug law that says, in drug cases if you talk, your sentence can be reduced infinitely.

				This should be a no brainer. Don&#039;t say anything except for whatever you are required to tell the police ( In my country this is your name, occupation, address, and your birth date) don&#039;t lie cops are used to seeing through lies. This is easy to do SAY NOTHING and then you are not lying.. And last but not least LAWYER. If you are caught with small amounts i wouldn&#039;t bother though

That&#039;s obvious as shit that you&#039;re trying to hide something.<br /><br />On the other hand if it&#039;s an amount that you could do hard time for, shut up and lawyer up.

It is possible to watch you tube videos through tor you just have to go enable some plug in. All you other paranoid parrots need to realize that tor itself is not safe at all if you&#039;re running it on your personal machine and not a usb bootable os or virtual machine. The government has been investigating this operation for a while and the easiest way for them to figure out who you are is through tor nodes they have set up. <br /><br />By going to a video you&#039;re not gonna set off a red alert at the van parked outside your house, for them to take you down through a raid. Go fucking learn about IT and computers some more before just making shit up.&nbsp; :o
