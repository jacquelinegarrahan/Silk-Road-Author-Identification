I really need a lot of help here. I dont have any idea where to start to turn the encryption on. If you could please help me!

				It isn&#039;t something you turn on, it&#039;s something you download onto your OS... there are plenty of threads floating around on how to do this. What OS are you using?

				This helped me alot.<br />If you have Windows Operating System (I have 2007 XP):<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tim_Starling/Gpg4win_tutorial<br /><br /><br />This was good too for novices (me!):&nbsp; (Do this one first)<br /><br />http://www.gpg4win.org/handbuecher/novices_5.html<br /><br />Good luck.

				To the new people on this thread: well done for coming to forums, and for studying and asking questions.&nbsp; You&#039;ll find that we all had to go thru this, to one degree or another, but you will be surprised at how much more computer savvy you become, just for plowing thru all this.&nbsp; We are friendly and helpful, as long as you are willing to do the work.&nbsp; It can be tedious, but it really is good idea to go back thru at least the Security Forums, as there is so much useful info: I did it recently myself, and it improved matters.<br /><br />PGP4win includes some valuable documentation.&nbsp; Unlike many apps, the documentation was a really good tutorial, and I went thru it, and it taught me how to use pgp: http://www.gpg4win.org/documentation.html<br /><br />Whenever vendors provide a public key, I always use it and encrypt my address.&nbsp; That&#039;s another good way to learn how it all works, by downloading the vendor&#039;s public keys, and by sending them your address, and *your* public key, already encrypted.&nbsp; But as you&#039;ve found, there are people here who will answer you and provide their public key so you can practice.&nbsp; As long as we help the next person along, we can pay back the favor.&nbsp; Several have pmed me with their public key, and I&#039;ve always responded with an encrypted msg, including my pub key...<br /><br />On &#039;finalizing early&#039;: this is a much debated, constant topic on here: I recommend against it,&nbsp; *any* time it is a new vendor.&nbsp; With older vendors, if you have checked the forums and made sure they are reputable, you may be required to &#039;finalize early&#039; before they will sell to you, and it is up to you.&nbsp; Normally, you finalize when you receive product, so that vendors can collect their money.&nbsp; Again, much debate, and here you really should read up in the &#039;security&#039; forums, on this very topic, as you will have to come to your own conclusions...again, *never* finalize early for new vendors.&nbsp; I just them *saying* they are oldtimers on here, doesn&#039;t mean they are.&nbsp; Make sure to research in the &#039;rumor mill&#039; to make sure vendors are legit...some scammers are really good at bullshitting, so be alert on this one...<br /><br />Best wishes!<br /><br /><br /><br />
