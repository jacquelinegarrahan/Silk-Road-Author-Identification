				Hello,<br />say a person that has a seller account, wants to transfer bitcoins to his or her buyer account.<br />(for the sole purpose of trading on sr) but wants to be safe and anonymous.<br />Does one need to tumble between accounts?<br />If so what is a legitimate tumbler to use?<br />Thanks Peeps.

				it isn&#039;t needed however a direct acc to acc transfer will show up on both of those accounts transactions with names. An attacker who compromised one account would know they are linked<br /><br />If you are paranoid like I am, withdraw to an ewallet then pump it back in

				Thats why you have 10 different sr buyer accounts and do random transfers to/from different ones each time. As long as you can have as many different buyers accounts,&nbsp; might as well take advantage. One day, I hope that they make it so one can&#039;t make unlimited&nbsp; number of buyer accounts. Its a huge advantage for a buyer to commit reverse fraud multiple times..<br /><br />Honestly, there is 44k members here.. I bet there is actually less than 7k users that use on a regular basis, maybe less...I know that in the beginning, I had to make 3 or 4 accounts because I forgot either the username that I used or password. now, those 3 or 4 accounts are totally inactive. Also, I know when LE or another member is trying to remain anonymous, I bet I have at least 20 different pms from individuals that have never read the pm that I sent, so that tells me that those accounts are just one timers...
