				If one destroys their hard drive in their laptop and replaces it with another, does that erase every trace of recoverable memory on the the laptop?

				Load up a live CD too and blast the memory, though it should erase itself after an hour or so of no power (disconnect battery). <br />Also did you properly kill the HD.. simply breaking it into pieces is not enough. Truecrypt it with impossible random password, then use http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/SecureErase.shtml to access bad partitions and nuke them.<br />

				Also if you plan on going though HD&#039;s regularly in the future just use live usb to run your os from, destroying a small usb stick is much easier then a big chunk of metal :)

I think DBAN&#039;s Boot and Nuke has been mentioned before here. For ultra reliability use the Gutmann method which passes random data over the old information 35 times - Even our Secret Service here in the UK can&#039;t recover data from a hard drive wiped in this way but obviously your NSA in the USA have considerably more resources so either sell the old hard drive or dispose of it discretely - I dropped mine down a drain last time!<br /><br />V.

				Once cloud computing genuinely comes into it&#039;s own, so much of these discussions will become completely irrelevant. Instead of having to track down 1 encrypted HD, it could be a million HDs with a trace bit of data on it, and so forth. Hypothetically of course.

				If you have an ATA or SSD drive, use this: http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/SecureErase.shtml<br />It destroys everything by using hardware manufacturer secure erase built into every drive. Completely destroys all data, bad blocks and other areas no software can reach. Note to yourself: don&#039;t use SSD drives Truecrypt advises against it.<br /><br />Else: <br />- download any linux live CD .ISO, burn to cd and reboot<br />-encrypt the entire disc using Truecrypt with ridiculous maximum length password made up of totally random characters<br />-open terminal. If your live CD doesn&#039;t have dcfldd then apt-get install dcfldd or aptitude search dcfldd<br />-enter in terminal: &quot;dcfldd pattern=lol of=/dev/sda&quot; (change /dev/sda to wherever your disc is mounted obviously, drop to terminal and type &quot;dmesg | grep sd&quot; your HD is probably sda )<br /><br />entire disc will be overwritten with lololololololol which is a great message for the feds to read when they seize your drive and try to analyze it using Encase forensic software. verify this by typing &quot;dcfldd if=/dev/sda | hexdump -C&quot;
