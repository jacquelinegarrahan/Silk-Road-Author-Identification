				I really miss Bitfloor a lot, already.<br />I used Bitinstant again today, first time in several months. I was very nervous, but it worked out fine. Two confirmations within 30 minutes.

				Used Bitinstant 2 times recently and had nothing but success.&nbsp; First time $ was in account before I even got home.....2nd time had to wait a few more minutes but nothing that made me worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think they were just overwhelmed and have themselves back on track currently.....but I have no information on that other than reading their blog and my own experiences for what it&#039;s worth.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anybody still missing $ from them can you tell us how it&#039;s going getting it back?

				Was pretty shocked when I went to bitfloors site and saw they went under. They had raised their fees anyway so its not a big L. Anyway bitinstant is still all good, all the ways to do it been working lately. Walmart is def the place to go if you want it to be fast, make sure they store your info in the system for speed *-*

				All I see on bitinstant is the coupon option, do I need to purchase a bitstamp coupon etc first, can anyone walk through the process?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen the cash deposit option in months.
