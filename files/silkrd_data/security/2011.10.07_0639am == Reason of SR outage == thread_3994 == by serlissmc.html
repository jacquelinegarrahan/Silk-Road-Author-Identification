				This is concerning the official SR message:<br /><br />&quot;So the server went down unexpectedly today. This was very unnerving because we thought it had somehow been seized or something terrible like that. Fortunately it was just some kind of glitch and we were able to reboot. Everything has been backed up and is totally current, but we are not going to turn the site back on for a couple of days while we work out a way to prevent such problems. We are terribly sorry for this inconvenience, but we want to provide the best service possible, and random outages just aren&#039;t going to cut it. We know it must be terribly frustrating, but we are taking the better-safe-than-sorry approach and we hope you understand.&quot;<br /><br />We Anonymous, were testing our new WebLOIC on several sites including The Silk Road and The Underground Wiki.&nbsp; This is not the hoax #refref.&nbsp; <br /><br />We apologize for the inconvenience of it may have caused to SR users.&nbsp; Take this as a warning to those who host CP on darknets.&nbsp; We will take you down.&nbsp; We have the means.<br /><br />We are Anonymous<br />We are Legion<br />We do not Forgive<br />We do not Forget<br />Expect Us

				This is fucking retarded. First, with DDoS on hidden services you harm the TOR project and your own cause. I am all against own action against CP sites, but wtf has silk road to do with CP. I suspect you just DDoSed SR because you don&#039;t have a real CP target. On another note, DDoS won&#039;t really spell problems for CP boards I guess. If they decide to move to other solutions, you won&#039;t have anything at hand versus them, so rather try more sophisticated hacking.<br />I would be a proud man if anonymous would ever get shit done, but I think they are way too less organized and don&#039;t have any idea of how the world works.<br />What SR and similar people do is way more sophisticated, organized and much less fail inbound.<br />Sorry to tell you.<br />Much love and good luck, please leave us alone, we don&#039;t have CP and if you had a real idea of politics, you would know we are on the right side.<br />M
