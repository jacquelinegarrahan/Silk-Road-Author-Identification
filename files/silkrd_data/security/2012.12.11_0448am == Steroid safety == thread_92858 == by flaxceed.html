				One of my customers told me today that any questions asked of other steroids vendors gets them a few words back, while I tend to be very thorough when asked about side effects and proper diet, rest, exercise, etc.&nbsp; As a result I want to give the community some info about a first testosterone cycle as it relates to safety and optimum health.<br /><br />First, don&#039;t overdo it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t jack up the dosage, don&#039;t blow off my recommendations.&nbsp; Test will raise your bad cholesterol which skews your lipid profile.&nbsp; You need to eat right and do cardio besides lifting weights.&nbsp; You also need plenty of good fats in your diet like almonds and brazil nuts, sardines or mackeral or herring or salmon.&nbsp; Eat egg whites not yolks.&nbsp; Eat fat free yogurt and drink fat free milk.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have joint pain or discomfort, change the exercise!!!&nbsp; Go from straight bar curls to bent-bar.&nbsp; Or from flat bench to incline bench, or from barbell bench press to dumbbell presses.&nbsp; Do exercises that don&#039;t hurt your joints!!!!&nbsp; You have to go heavy to get the most out of the testosterone- on working sets, if you are doing more than 6 reps it&#039;s too light.&nbsp; If you can do 4-5 reps it&#039;s great.&nbsp; This is AFTER the warmup set/s.<br /><br />If you are not sleeping 9 hours per night you are not getting enough out of your program.&nbsp; No need to use testosterone or any other steroids if you are not giving them a chance to work!&nbsp; Nobody ever got huge sleeping 5 hours a night.&nbsp; Sleep, work, sleep.&nbsp; Get a nap on weekends or whenever you are off work.&nbsp; This is in addition to your 9 hours.&nbsp; You don&#039;t grow in the gym, you grow when you sleep.&nbsp; Sleep more and you will add more muscle.<br /><br />Steroids are inherently dangerous.&nbsp; If you are not following these guidelines your chance of getting hurt or hurting someone else are very high.&nbsp; You should always stay away from recreational drugs while on cycle.&nbsp; They increase your risk of mental health issues or violence.&nbsp; If you are naturally depressed or have anger issues or are a bit neurotic or psychotic, steroids will make this worse.&nbsp; How can you be safe?&nbsp; Sleep enough.&nbsp; Do your cardio.&nbsp; Eat right.&nbsp; Take your prescribed medication on time, every time.&nbsp; If you are not prepared to do all of these things, you are not ready for steroids.<br /><br />If your only mental health issue is depression, steroids may make you feel better.&nbsp; This does not mean that testosterone is medicine for depression as it is not.&nbsp; The side effects are serious and there are better ways to treat depression.&nbsp; BUT you will enjoy your time on cycle as a result of getting more and better sleep and having an overall feeling of well-being that you get from the test and a healthy lifestyle as you build your body.<br /><br />Send me a note if you have any questions!<br /><br />flax<br /><br /><br /><br />
