				********************************************* THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SECURITY ADVICE FOR ALL VENDORS&nbsp; *********************************************<br /><br />Hey all you vendors out there on SILK ROAD i thought i would give you some security advice that would hopefully make your success rate for not having packages intercepted by customs when shipping overseas so <br />***PLEASE*** inform the buyer when they make a purchase not leave in the feedback from that they received it or it took how ever many days to make it to Australia or Down Under or anything that would tip off the customs or border security in that country that they have successfully received a package from you no matter what country you are from as it only helps them in work out what country to scan letters and packages from as im sure that they look at Silk Road forums and vendor feedback to see if there is any comments that Australians or people from other country&#039;s&nbsp; have received a product off you. <br />I hope that by you reading this you can now inform some dumb ass buyers how to be ninja like when making a purchase.<br />May all you future sales arrive safe to you and please inform any other vendors to do the same so that we can help out all vendors and buyers in Australia and other country&#039;s that buy off you and hopefully have a 100% success rate so you don&#039;t have to give out refunds and reships.<br /><br /><br />CHEERS ALL :D<br />
