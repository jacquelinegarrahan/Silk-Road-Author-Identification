				Is it ok to use a UPS store as a receiving address?<br /><br />I ask because you have an actual street address but they then out it in a mailbox for you that <br />can be accessed after hours.&nbsp; I could scope the scene before I pickup anything?<br /><br />Does anyone else do this?&nbsp; <br /><br />Just looking for better options than my house or neighbors house.&nbsp; Wonder if I could register<br />with fake info and use that for shipping.&nbsp; Then if things go south for me I just become myself<br />and play dumb...<br /><br />thoughts?

				Would love to hear some thoughts on this as well. I know they are accessible 24 hours a day, so that&#039;s a plus.<br /><br /><br />

				Well I ask because I live in a new area and know very few people.&nbsp; I do not have any way to have an address that isn&#039;t my own.<br /><br />Mailmen aren&#039;t gonna leave mail at an empty house.&nbsp; Maybe but that is a risk to me...<br /><br />I am just trying to think of other ways besides shipping to where I live.

				I should look into the fake ID vendors on here and see if that is a viable option.&nbsp; Use that for a mail box in the next town over.<br /><br />Out of state ID as I just moved here, and need a local address before I set up permanent residence.&nbsp; Something like that.<br /><br />

I wonder how LE would deal with trying to do a controlled delivery to a place like this.
