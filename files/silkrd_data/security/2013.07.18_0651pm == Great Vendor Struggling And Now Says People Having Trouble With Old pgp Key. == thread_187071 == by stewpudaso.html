				A really good vendor has been struggling recently.&nbsp; This vendor recently posted that people are having troubles with his pgp key and they should copy and use his new key..... The old key is twice as long as the new key. Does the amount of characters in the key have anything to do with the amount of incryption? If so why would a vendor replace a key with one that is easier to crack? Maybe I am just paranoid but if LE raided a vendors house couldn&#039;t they set up a reverse sting operation. But they would have to get a new pgp key. This is propably nothing, should I place my order with the old key? I am too paranoid to use new key.

				Do not use the old key if there is a new one supplied. That is why they state to use the new key. If you are that worried I would just choose a new vendor.

				When I save the new key a message states that the file already exist, does that mean that the vendor signed the new key with the old one and deleted the old one?
