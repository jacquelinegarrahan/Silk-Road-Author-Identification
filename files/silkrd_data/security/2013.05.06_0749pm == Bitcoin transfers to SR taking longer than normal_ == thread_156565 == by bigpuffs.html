				with these ongoing attacks are transfers to the road taking longer to confirm?&nbsp; I sent coins into my account 3 hours ago and still nothing, and blockchain shows 15 confirmations for the transaction.&nbsp; Anybody else experiencing longer than normal transfer times?&nbsp; Trying to to worry about this.

				I made a deposit today and the coins were hijacked before ever making it to SR. I can see the accounts that are currently receiving the funds on blockchain.info, but the account history here shows they never made it. This seems to me like SR has somehow been compromised from the inside since how else could some initiate the transfer of them except from the destination account number?

				This happened with my first BTC deposit on SR a few months ago and SR Support addressed it promptly. Granted, now I rarely do deposits anymore as I just buy BTC from Sugar Mama. But before I started doing that I was using BitFloor and depositing into my SR wallet with no problems. Not fun waiting for coins to land, I know, but I&#039;ve learned that it&#039;s best to plan a day ahead. It&#039;s not realistic to always expect coins to come through right away whether you&#039;re buying them thru an SR vendor or doing a deposit from an outside wallet...

The tumbler sends all payments through a complex, semi-random series of dummy transactions, each with a new, one-use receiving address, making it nearly impossible to link your payment with any coins leaving the site. The quantity, frequency, and number of transactions are all varied chaotically in a way that mimics the transactions of the Bitcoin economy as a whole.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Libertas
