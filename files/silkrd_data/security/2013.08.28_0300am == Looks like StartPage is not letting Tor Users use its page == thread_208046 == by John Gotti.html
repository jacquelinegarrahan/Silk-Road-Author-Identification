				Overwhelmed? Or something else? This is what happens when using &quot;StartPage&quot; (Tor&#039;s Default search engine). You get a page that says this.<br /><br />&quot;<br />Welcome Tor Users!<br /><br />We are happy to welcome you to Startpage, the world&#039;s most private search engine. Startpage now serves well over 2 million searches per day, making us the biggest private search service on the Internet.<br /><br />Like Tor, Startpage was private long before privacy was cool. We have a fourteen-year company track record, and we are the only search engine that can back up our privacy promises with third-party certification.<br /><br />Here are just a few of our powerful, privacy-protecting features:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We do not record anything about you — not your IP address, not your search queries, and we never use tracking cookies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We provide 100% Google results — We submit your search anonymously to Google and return their results to you in total privacy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We encrypt all traffic — using HTTPS, so even your ISP can&#039;t snoop on your searches.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We offer a powerful free proxy — that lets you anonymously view third-party websites with every search.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We&#039;re third-party certified and independently audited — by EuroPrise and Certified Secure, so you can take our privacy promises to the bank.<br /><br />We love Tor!<br /><br />We believe in the Tor project and its privacy mission and we applaud your efforts to pursue serious Internet privacy.<br /><br />As you know, Tor recently included Startpage as the default search engine in the new Tor Browser Bundles. Thank you! We&#039;re honored to be associated with all of you like-minded, hard-core privacy fanatics.<br />Just One Small Catch...<br /><br />However, the avalanche of new Tor users has created an issue with the algorithm we use to detect and reject automated screen-scraping programs. When multiple Tor users are searching through the same end node, Startpage may wrongly conclude that the searches are coming from a scraper.<br /><br />The unfortunate result is that Startpage may occasionally not return results with Tor. But don&#039;t panic, we&#039;re committed to fixing it.<br />Here&#039;s a Temporary Solution<br /><br />We are reaching out to the Tor developers to find a permanent solution. In the meantime, here is a workaround for Tor users:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you use the Tor Browser Bundle:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Switching to a new Tor identity is easy and fast. Click the green onion icon next to your address bar, then click &quot;New Identity&quot; and try your search again. In some cases, you may have to switch identities a few times for this to work.<br /><br />We want Tor users to have a great private search experience with Startpage, and we appreciate your patience while we develop a long-term solution. As you use Startpage, we&#039;d love to hear from you and get your impressions.<br /><br />Meanwhile, thanks for supporting the vision of Tor and Startpage and a completely private Internet!<br />

				Seems like a fair way to let everyone know what&#039;s going on, though.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see why a specific exit node looks a lot like a scraping bot to them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lots of simultaneous queries from identical browsers., and I&#039;m guessing most of their anti-scraping methods work based on source IP, request metadata (browser header, etc), and frequency of access.&nbsp; &nbsp;A dozen folks using Tor Browser look something up at the same instant via the same exit, and it looks like a bot.&nbsp; Identical headers, identical source, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;d guess it has as much to do with DoS attack mitigation as it does anti-scraping.&nbsp; &nbsp; Search engines especially have issues with DoS attacks since the act of performing a single search consumes many more resources (CPU, db, etc) than just returning cachable content.<br /><br />I somewhat expect a certain amount of annoying IP-based bans using Tor..&nbsp; Even Tor-friendly sites occasionally have a specific exit-node IP banned.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use a new identity, pick a new exit node, and hopefully it works.

				This title is misleading. They&#039;re not forbidding Tor users from using startpage, they just currently have a technical problem which is *easily and quickly* solved by hitting the new identity button (which I can verify from personal experience). <br /><br />Startpage, as is apparent by the tone of the copy and paste above, strongly supports Tor and its users.

				Not new. I&#039;ve had this happen maybe 8 months ago. It&#039;s a server reliability mechanism.
