				You&#039;re on the right track Sickboy--I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re in the states or not but in the US if you contribute even a nominal amount to either political party or a PAC or other advocacy group, you will basically be on every social agenda group&#039;s mailing list in the country forever.&nbsp; Pay them once an they don&#039;t go away!

				Yes, Sickboy, obviously thinking along same lines...for int. shipments, also good to sign up as new business and put this address out there...make sure you have big box, and also even a couple of magazine subscriptions ensure that your mailing address gets out there...I&#039;m on same path ... naturally we can&#039;t post specifics, but I like seeing others going down these roads...better safe than sorry...

				Silk road sales don&#039;t blend in so well with &#039;junk mail&#039;. What&#039;s far better is to receive a lot of personal correspondence, postcards, tiny packages, bubble mailers, etc. from people all around the country.<br />

				Order a lot of free samples, that way you&#039;re getting actual packages and you&#039;ll also most likely be signed up for junk mail as well.<br /><br />There are plenty of free samples sites, here is one of the better ones:<br /><br />http://www.spoofee.com/forums/freebies-giveaways<br /><br /><br />You can also go to ebay and order some cheap stuff for like 99 cents to blend in with the SR stuff.

				If anyone wants to get flooded with mail to make SR shipments blend in, for just a small fee in bitcoins to cover shipping &amp; handling I can have postcards, letters, bubble mailers, and Priority flat rate envelopes sent from all over the USA. International mail could be arranged&nbsp; as well.<br /><br />PM me on here if you are interested.

It wouldn&#039;t help as disguise.<br /><br />Reasons:<br /><br />1. They get their junk mail in BULK. Seriously, as in whole stacks at a time.<br /><br />2. Junk mail is 100% using bulk rate payment (not stamps). It&#039;s processed differently than stamped mail. If eg a seller sent you a &quot;junk mail&quot; catalog that had non-bulk addressing / labels / stamps, that&#039;d be a huge red flag.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this would work. Anyone have good arguments in favor or for why I&#039;m wrong?
