				Hey, Last week I used torwallet without porblems.<br />Yesterday I transferred about 20 BC onto there. Later when I tried to move them off onto SR, I received the<br />following message:<br /><br />&quot;Hot wallet exhausted. Please wait while we move coins in from our offline wallet.&quot;<br /><br />This has been going on for about a day now. Anyone else have this problem or using torwallet succesfully ATM?<br />Anyone EVER had this problem?<br /><br />Thanks!

My apologies. It just gets frustrating to see constant new threads that there is no need for when 99.99% of the information is already available.<br /><br />I would, however, advise you to search bitcointalk.org to see if others are having problems with TORwallet; the bitcointalk forum houses the most active Bitcoin community on the net, so if you have a problem with TORwallet, others there are most likely going to have experienced the same thing.<br />Indeed a quick search of bitcointalk.org brought up the following recent threads concerning TORwallet, including two (the first two) with a reply from the TORwallet representative at bitcointalk.org:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=109393.0<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=107541.40<br /><br />And their actual thread here, where another TORwallet user seems to be experiencing similar issues:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=87387.msg1095050#msg1095050<br /><br />As far as their hotwallet is concerned, no, it should not take anywhere near this amount of time to replenish it. In fact, it would be nearly instant when they initiate the transfer of funds. I don&#039;t know what is going on with them, and can offer no other advice as I have never used their service.<br /><br />Apologies again for my somewhat snappy initial response. I would recommend posting in each of those topics at bitcointalk, and PMing the TORwallet representative. It should also be noted that TORwallet is not a .org site, it is a .net site, just in case a copycat site pops up.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Graham, I&#039;m glad you realized your reply was totally presumptuous and uncalled for.&nbsp; I am also having this problem.&nbsp; Yeah, I did check those threads before coming here and they still don&#039;t answer a thing, and knowing what a hot wallet is has no bearing on whether or not or when we can get our coins out of TorWallet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like the OP, I have used the service before without issue, and I have never heard anything bad about Torwallet, so I just assumed it was safe to use again as an intermediary.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed them and sent them a PM on Bitcointalk.org and have yet to receive a response.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is there are no solutions anywhere and the one or two people that complained a couple weeks ago or whatever never came back to say whether their issue had been resolved.

				ARGHHHH! This is going on far too long; I had the thought that maybe they are using everyones bitcoins to invest, and then putting them back (Hopefully!) after a few days. <br /><br />Next time I will not be a cheap ass, and I will pay the extra whatever % to use BTC -email...

				The weird thing is the coins are still in the wallet, mine at least, and they are still stuck there.&nbsp; It&#039;s been 5 days already since I put them in there.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad it was only a pretty small amount.&nbsp; Even if it were just 1 bitcoin in there I&#039;d still be pissed off.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;s going to take for bitcointalk.org to label TORwallet as a scam.&nbsp; We&#039;ve heard nothing at all from them.
