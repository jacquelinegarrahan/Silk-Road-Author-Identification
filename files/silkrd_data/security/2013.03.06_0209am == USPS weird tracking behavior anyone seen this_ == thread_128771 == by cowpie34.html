				It said it made it to a sort facility and was processed and then processed again and then left and then 3 days later is back at the same facility and was processed again.&nbsp; So basically this international has been in the same place 11 days or 7 business days..&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that a red flag?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				Not really.....stuff gets rerouted all the time...and mistakes happen all the time....IMO if you can still track it....its still in process.<br /><br />Good luck

				I saw a package go to the East coast sort facility from &quot;Utah&quot; let&#039;s say, and then back to an address one state away. It was First class mail and took over 10 days. Who knows why.

				Only time I had this was when a client used a fake name and it ended up getting returned to sender after the second time passing through the facility and trying to deliver.

				Yea I have seen that before. It&#039;s not anything to worry about. <br /><br />If it were seized or something I don&#039;t think you would still be able to continue tracking it. <br /><br />Jeez that had to have your nerves on edge.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Add to the list of crazy-ass USPS routes--when they screw up, they do it royally.&nbsp; <br /><br />I once ordered something from eBay, it started in New Jersey, then went to Philadelphia, then the next stop was San Francisco, where it stayed for about 2 weeks, until finally it was rescanned at Philly and delivered to a suburb not too far outside of Philly.&nbsp; Like WHOOPS!!

				Yes, I&#039;ve seen this happen when receiving internationally, not for that long though, I would be concerned, but not tripping out.<br /><br />I once had a package that I had shipped from the mid west to the next state over take a detour to California before heading onto the destination.

I hope mine moves soon too. I think I am on the same boat you was. Mine was processed twice in the same place within number of days. I wonder why this happens.
