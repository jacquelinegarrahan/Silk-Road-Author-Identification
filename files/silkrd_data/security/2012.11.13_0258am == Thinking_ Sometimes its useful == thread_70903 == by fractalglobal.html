				I&#039;ve noticed a particularly resistant strain of a disease called &quot;stupidity&quot; going around lately. I figured I&#039;d put up some tips on how to avoid catching it, or if you have it, how to deal with it and hopefully cure yourself of it.<br /><br />Silk Road is a place where candidly anonymous sellers attempt to sell illicit items to candidly anonymous buyers. The site is designed around the concept of plausible deniability and secrecy.&nbsp; It&#039;s near impossible for LE to verify who anyone is here, and they almost certainly have better resources and motivation to do so than you.&nbsp; Therefore, no matter WHAT anyone says, its not guaranteed.&nbsp; As a result, VERIFY information. <br />If a stranger calls you and tells you that the sky just turned purple, you don&#039;t ring up your friends and tell them all the sky just turned purple.&nbsp; You go outside, have a look, see that it&#039;s not purple, then call him an idiot.<br />If a stranger rings up and says &quot;hey, I&#039;m an expert on the color of the sky, its purple today&quot; then you do the same thing as before.<br /><br /><br />If the stranger instead said &quot;hey, I know a lot about (subject), (event) is happening, look at (link to evidence) and (another link to evidence) and you will see I&#039;m right!!!&quot;<br />The best course of action is to go to neither of the links provided, and instead do your own damn search on (subject) and (event).<br /><br />

				I am in complete agreement with fractalglobal&#039;s point of view.<br />&nbsp;Another phenomena that seems to be occurring more and more often is starting a new thread to post a question that has already been posted quite a few times, and not bothering to use the excellent search function. When I first started using the SR forums, (about 7 months ago) I would spend hours every evening researching everything I could, and there was not&nbsp; nearly as much info as there is today.!!!<br />Seems we live in a &quot;I want it and I WANT IT NOW&quot; culture. This is a great shame because every time we give someone a step by step guide on how to do something, we actually deny them he opportunity of learning and&nbsp; understanding for themselves.<br />RANT OVER, just MHO :)

				fractalglobal is a man of reason and we would be wise to heed his advice.<br /><br />The stupidity is getting out of hand - for crying out loud, can we STOP posting those &quot;i orded 100kg of meth 2 my house am i gona get in truble&quot; type threads? If you are worried about LEO the last thing you need to be doing is telling everyone on this PUBLIC forum what was sent to whom, and where they are.
