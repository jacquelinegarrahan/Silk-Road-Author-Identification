				Layout. I run a few websites online, one of them had become rather popular and has been receiving allot of attn.<br />Recently i received two orders about 15 min apart from separate ips but their addresses are 25 mile apart and each is about 15 miles from dea hq. Here&#039;s the fun part. Both orders were for strange combos of product costing about 300 a piece. Both sent payment with their order for $500 each. Overpaying by $200+ ea.<br />This smelled easy to fishy, my pick up guy already took the funds so i just marked the orders as shipped. Now I&#039;m waiting to see if either complains about not receiving.<br />Anyone ever see this happen before? If it were only one order that drastically over paid i wouldn&#039;t be worried and i would&#039;ve just sent a message or credit but two, back to backwith all the red flags just made me uncomfortable

				You should give more details...<br /><br />What are those websites selling? If it is cocaine, you must worry. If i were you actually, i would start to run right now!<br /><br />On the other hand, if it&#039;s car parts, you should worry only about paying taxes...

				If it is the DEA and you do send the stuff. Do they have anyway of finding you? or who sent them? Then if no - fuck it, send em! Carry on camping.

				dox the people who ordered, I do this for some of my customers when I suspect LE. If you want I can dox both people for 1 bitcoin. Basic things you can do are check to see if their address matches up with white pages info, check to see if the address was recently for sale or rent, check the property value. Find them on facebook myspace ect. Find their email check to see if their email has posted adds on websites like craigsist maybe trying to sell shoes or something.

				@skills, anabolics, I wouldn&#039;t try selling cocaine on the web (excluding silk road)<br />@baby, the difference is that both of these orders were for less than 300$ but both sent payments of $500 each. I&#039;ve had people send 10-15 bucks extra before but not a couple hundred. who does that??<br />@key, I would rather not give them anything to sniff at. Hopefully if it is some punk dea agent they&#039;ll just move on when they don&#039;t receive anything. If I do send something theres tons they can look at to narrow it down. Where it was shipped from, where the postage was paid for at and how, finger prints (I wear gloves through every process so I&#039;m not worried here). I would rather not peak anyones interest. Been there, done that. Not a fun ride.<br />&nbsp;@34, dont understand the lingo *dox* I&#039;m getting old I guess. I checked the info as much as possible. One of the addies was a foreclosed home, one of the emails was registered to some arabic dude in DC with a full on arabic layout on his FB. Didn&#039;t look like the juicer type

What a fucking asshole, might as well drop a msg on their fb page &quot;yo, got ur money drugs on are the way&quot;. Serisously fucktards like you should be banned. Just one more reason not to give a real name.

				@red their payment methods were prepaid. Maybe they both got the limits for 500 and used the numbers. Beats me but it&#039;s strange that we got two orders from two separate people paying the same amount, from the same area. Not to mention neither ordered a proper cycle, they both ordered misc bits of everything.<br />@master...were you dropped on your head? Establish how a link would be made and get back to me, thanks bud.

				By googling a name, it stays on google&#039;s servers, your ISP records it. I mean, assume that your ISP records every website you go to and every image or video you download. They do, and it&#039;s easy and cheap to store so there&#039;s no reason to stop.<br />If you or the customer get vanished, it leads to a direct trace to the other side. Ultimate checkmate. The Coup de Grace.<br />You cannot allow the enemy to have such an easy lead.

Searching someones name on FB is like sending them a greeting card with your signature. I&#039;m glad this guy brought this up, if you give the seller your real name then you&#039;ve basically given him the chance to expose you and possibly blackmail you. Its not like pre-social days when everyone was a ghost, now people have a much more official online presence.

				I use tails on a cpu with no HD, wireless mobile broadband that I change each month registered under false info. I reset my identity every 10 or 15 min when I&#039;m doing something important.<br />I try to avoid using google as much as possible. <br />If I&#039;m missing a step in security I&#039;m all ears. I&#039;m ultra paranoid so I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s such thing as being too safe.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t search his name, I searched his email addy on startpage which brought me to his FB. I don&#039;t own a FB so all i could see was his cover page.<br />In my business you can&#039;t do much black mailing. No one really goes out of their way to bust a steroid user. In fact they don&#039;t go too far to bust steroid dealers but occasionally they will get a fire under their ass and come for us like the hounds of hell are on their heels.

				In addition:<br />I go through great lengths to protect both my customers and myself. If either of these guys do contact me I will send them their money back and tell them to find a new source, I&#039;ve shown this order to a few fellow sources and partners and they all agree that it doesn&#039;t seem right.<br />
