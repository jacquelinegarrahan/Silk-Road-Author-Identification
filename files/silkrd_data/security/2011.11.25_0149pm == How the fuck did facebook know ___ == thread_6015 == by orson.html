				Hey Peeps,<br /><br />Just thought I would ask this question as it has been bothering me bit time, and I can&#039;t work out how the fuck they did it.<br /><br />Basically last week while I was on facebook, down the right hand side a few of my pics popped up and facebook asked me was this picture taken at &#039;where ever&#039;, and fuck me it was bang on each time, how the hell does facebook know a picture of a friend &amp; I was taken at this random hotel??<br /><br />All the pictures where taken on a professional cam, so no geotagging etc<br /><br />To be honest it worried me, has this happened to anyone else??

				It happens all the time, don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; FB has some facial recognition features, and that, combined with their &quot;places&quot; feature allows them to put 2 and 2 together pretty slickly (is that a word?).&nbsp;

				Yeah, Facebook is doing all they can to display every ounce of information about every person alive on the world wide web. Think about it, if they had gone through with the Facial Recognition thing that would auto-tag everyone in every photo you ever posted, you could go out and take a photo of ANYONE. An old highschool crush, the cashier at Starbucks, some random girl you&#039;ve never met, and with the simple click of a button you could know everything there is to know about them.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty fucked up.

Its actually kind of creepy that such technology exists, even if not directly being utilized by Facebook at the moment, because that doesn&#039;t mean the people with this technology can&#039;t utilize Facebook&#039;s massive database. :-/
