				I still wouldn&#039;t let my guard down. The cops are probably monitoring Silk Road and its forum 24/7 and anybody who has their real IP address exposed is in serious trouble even if they are just a buyer.

You have to make sure that you aren&#039;t using an one-hop circuit for instance because there are rogue nodes out there that can deanonymous you by forcing you through an one-hop circuit. You need to have three circuits to be anonymous on TOR as well have certain things disabled like JavaScript and Flash.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a good guide on how you can secure yourself on the Internet with Virtual Machines, Truecrypt, Linux, and etc. <br />http://f3ew3p7s6lbftqm5.onion/text/torguide_v1_0_1.txt<br /><br />&nbsp;Ok I might be uber paranoid, but can somebody please tell me if it is safe to have JavaScript or some other scripts enabled while browsing this site? I have all my scripts disabled right now with NoScript so I am wondering if I loosing out on some essential features of this site.

No.&nbsp; If used as intended, will it grant you good anonymitization? Sure.<br /><br />This is not to you can&#039;t mess yourself up with tortunnel or advtor if you really try but the vast majority of users will find the defaults &quot;good enough&quot;.<br /><br />As for your guide, it&#039;s well enough, but I would urge any *nix user to consider whole disk encryption with LUKS.<br /><br />As for the scripts, I&#039;ll never argue against being paranoid.
