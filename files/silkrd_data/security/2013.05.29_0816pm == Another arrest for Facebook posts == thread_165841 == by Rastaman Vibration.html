However, I do support the right of people to keep firearms and use these in self defense. I&#039;ve lived in societies were firearms are more common and others were firearms are strictly prohibited and, imo, the gun-toting places are in many ways much safer. I have lived in the US for a time in a &#039;show cause&#039; state where the gov&#039;t must make the case why someone should not be issued a concealed weapons permits, instead of the citizen having to prove why they should be granted one. Incidence of random crime of opportunity are much lower there, indeed the violent crime rate in London is as high as it is due in large part to criminals knowing they can assume all people are unarmed, and unable to defend themselves (even CS gas is illegal in the UK). And as we saw recently as two Islamists beheaded a soldier on a busy London street with many people watching; when people are doing very bad things, the police are only 20 minutes away (that&#039;s how long these murderers stood in the street dripping in blood waiting for the cops with guns to arrive) For liberty to flourish the state should be a little frightened of its people. Otherwise it will grow and absorb more and more of liberties people once took for granted. The UK is definitely a good example of this.

Islamic terrorism is the least of your worries - While the UK, US and Israel support and finance global terrorism you stupid shitheads in the UK don&#039;t wake the fuck up and realize that the problem is not with Muslims. It has nothing to do with religion but geo political and economic power. Muslim countries are occupied and their oppressive leaders sponsored by the developed world.. to steal and take their resources. When Gaddafi started killing people in Libya.. within months NATO scrambled an army to take him down. How about Syria? Nope.. no Oil. nobody gives a fuck. over 100k dead.<br /><br />If you care about the safety and well being of your motherland you will listen to my words. Israel needs to STOP the apartheid on the Palestinians - the U.S and UK need to withdraw their troops from the middle east - Respect other peoples faiths and ideas... let them worship in peace. I promise you if these are met... global terrorism would be eradicated. You have this false conception that islamic terrorists are blowing shit up because they hate your way of life. Nope, it&#039;s because they feel like the developed world is at war with them.. and their demands are actually pretty damn fair (although the means don&#039;t justify the end).<br /><br /><br />Your government better wake the fuck up and realize.. otherwise the United Kingdom of Islam will be flying it&#039;s flag at bukingham palace m8.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				The UK occupied Iraq.. and was involved in the removal of Gadaffi... and today it&#039;s lifted an arms ban in order to arm and supply rebels in Syria. Libya has Africas LARGEST oil reserve. If your government really gave a shit about people they would have intervened in Myanmar where bhuddists are slaughtering Muslims daily. The case is very simple.. NATO doesnt give a fuck about the well being of people. For them, it&#039;s about keeping the world reserve currency and ensuring the security of their interests in the region. &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; is just a buzzword used.. similar to Alqaeda. It means nothing! It&#039;s to create a boogeyman and take away your civil rights to fight an imaginary enemy.. why? controlling the resources of the world. It&#039;s a fucking proxy war between Russia, China vs USA /EU and Israel. It&#039;s a very well known fact that Chinese presence in the region is growing stronger and as governments in the region ally with the east it creates an enormous problem for the U.S to ensure regional stability to secure the resources. Again, they dont give a fuck about the security of a Muslim country.. as long as the oil fields are secure it&#039;s all that matters. Are you not seeing the revolutions? What are Muslims calling for? Not democracy my friend.. they are calling for an Islamic state. This is why post revolution the elected parties were Islamic. <br />&nbsp;<br />Jihad in other countries? Dude.. theirs no such thing as an Islamic state today! You think Muslims like Saudia Arabia or Iran? They spit on those leaders. Bin Laden lead campaigns against the Saudi regime. Islam is against oppresion.. and the majority of our leaders are dictators that take order directly from NATO. When the Ottomans fell the British and French decided to divide up Muslim lands into their colonies - even as far as implementing the very same regimes they are so against today. Wake up man.. the enemy is NOT Islam. The enemy is our governments in the western world.<br /><br />Finally, you seem to think we live in the 1950&#039;s.. dude we live in a global economy. Yes, Libyan oil is benefitting the EU.. maybe not UK directly but it plays a huge factor in economic stability. Our fractional reserve system is an expand or die institution.. we need to keep invading other countries, taking their resources and inflating their currencies to continue to inflate the bubble we&#039;ve created. You can&#039;t look at these incidents as individual... it&#039;s all part of a global regime change. It&#039;s what the Bush administration stated shortly after 9/11...<br /><br />Heres my prediction my friend. It&#039;s been decades since &quot;Iran&quot; has been a problem in the region.. because it serves as a challenge to the Israeli apartheid. Syria will fall.. Hezbollah will fall.. and the zionists will try to go after Iran. but believe me.... this will not result in global security. It will only amplify the &quot;terrorism&quot; problem. Your government doesnt seem to get that if you drop bombs on civilians... you will create terrorists that no nothing but vengance. Mark my words man. I care about global security as much as you do.<br /><br />Btw, I do not support any organization or state that is terrorizing nations (on both sides). I do condemn the attacks done by &quot;muslims.&quot;

I must confess I can not agree with your logic there, mate. Imagine if coloured people would consider all white people to be either like, or in support of Fritzl and his actions unless they actively protested against them in public? because all white people would then be &quot;guilty witnesses&quot; unless they chose to take actions to prove they weren&#039;t. you would probably think to yourself that this would be absurd, but that&#039;s basically what happens to muslims and people who &quot;look&quot; like muslims i.e. brown people all the time, due to people who share the similar logic as you do. <br /><br />side note: I do support your attitude of keeping things civil, especially when talking about things like this that people are so engaged and passionate about. quite frankly I&#039;m appalled at the way people blatantly call each other idiots, just because they disagree on a matter. but I suppose this comes with the anonymity...&nbsp; <br />

				+1<br /><br />People don&#039;t want to talk about the obvious. Then when someone brings it up, they&#039;re labeled a racist.<br /><br />Fact is that western countries have been importing poverty and exporting wealth over the past 20 years. Islam is a big part of this process. Even worse, Muslims refuse to assimilate and adopt modern democratic values. They&#039;re 200 years behind modern, western society. And even worse than all that, they&#039;re trying to change society and remold it in their image.<br /><br />Try going to an Islamic country, do the same things, act the same way and then see what happens to you. Better yet, have your mother, sister, girlfriend or wife accompany you there. ;D<br /><br />Just to make it clear I&#039;m not talking about terrorists here, but regular folk. Some of them are very proud to admit it too. Their refusal to assimilate and desire to change their host countries at the expense of their hosts. I&#039;ve seen it and heard it myself. It&#039;s the kind of thing I really wish wasn&#039;t happening and was just racist talk and nothing else.<br /><br />A lot of good points have been made here about fractional reserve banking and the invasion and support of other brutal countries for valuable resources, but that doesn&#039;t give any of these people a right to come to a host country and tell EVERYONE ELSE how it should be. Yet, that&#039;s exactly what&#039;s happened all around most of the western countries. StExo wrote about a couple of really disturbing things he saw and was wrongly attacked for it.<br /><br />If history is any guide, this kind of thing will eventually lead to mass killings. A really, really ugly outcome no matter how you slice it.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165841.msg1178988#msg1178988">Quote from: StExo on May 30, 2013, 03:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">An intersection of race? The UK has given these people benefits, given them houses, shelters them from virtually any country in the world. The UK has the most soft power and influence in the world of any country. Don&#039;t believe me, go ask the OECD who collate all that data. We have welcomed many cultures, religions, beliefs and everything else for many years, heck we were one of the first countries where the courts stopped recognising slavery in law, the time of abolishing it there were very few slaves at all since they held the same right as the common man. The communities and minorities who do fall seperate of the main society have done so themselves and to be honest, I&#039;m not surprised, it is human nature to hang around with those most similar to you which is why we don&#039;t have around with birds very often, or rabbits etc. Nothing has stopped the migrating population from integrating successfully but their own attitudes when they disagree with our culture so intentionally segregate themselves.<br /><br />If you actually knew anything about the riots, you&#039;d know it was the idiots of the country running wild for a day or two, it was very few people in comparison with the whole population and if you take a look at the arrest statistics and demographics of those participating in the riots, you&#039;ll find the same pattern of the unemployed black youths or illegal immigrants. The vast majority of the UK does not feel entitled to much, it aggravates us however when we pay high taxes to foreign aid whilst cutting our own services and can fund £50,000 a year in benefits for an illegal immigrant but then decide to cut the welfare payments of the disabled and military veterans who have paid into the system all their life. That is what enrages the British public - not the ignoramus and fallacies you have put forward.<br /><br />As for nobody would have shot them in America - many of your fellow citizens disagree on the forum from those I&#039;ve spoken to and I&#039;ve seen your cops pretty regularly shoot people for simply not putting down a knife, yet alone beheading one of our soldiers who was raising money for charity in his own time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The enemy are the governments, the New World Order who runs them, the bankers who make up part of it, *and* Islam. The Elite find the gun, buy it, load it up with ammo and cock it. Then Islam happily takes the gun and pulls the trigger.<br /><br />But not always. Sometimes the former does all of the above and pulls the trigger, then blames it on the latter. Muslims are an easy target because they make it easy for themselves to be targeted. Then they&#039;re used by the NWO to create a global surveillance police state.<br /><br />A lot of times I think all of this is planned to create so much anger that more and more riots break out worldwide, which eventually leads to to civil war, then genocide. The Muslims don&#039;t see it and won&#039;t adapt to prevent this horrible outcome.

				&quot;People should not be afraid of their government. Governments, should be afraid of their people.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m going to get out the fact that I&#039;m Jewish before I even get into anything.<br /><br />Racism. Politics. Religious fanatics. These are all just stereotypes for the human condition. We are all greedy, and we all have egos. Some of us are better at controlling them, but usually those people don&#039;t sit in power positions, and if they do they&#039;re usually not there long enough to make a difference. It is naive to think that war isn&#039;t influenced by financial AND socioeconomic reasons, but you are also naive if you believe that is the only reason. History has much to tell us here, and while everyone is quick to mention all of the unrest of the last ~20-30 years, the reality is that after Vietnam there was a very big reality check. <br /><br />Yes, the majority of our armed conflicts worldwide since have been driven in part, and many in a majority, by economic reasons. However, the prospect of an economic ally, is not the same as conquering for resource theft. What Saddam did to Kuwait, and what he did to his own people, was quite enough. The Ba&#039;ath Party has had quite a reputation for its &quot;progressive&quot; thinking over the years. Was that conflict founded entirely on the desire to get oil? I don&#039;t think so.<br /><br />We can argue all day long about the second incursion, and the lies about WMDs and etc. Personally I don&#039;t give a shit, Saddam needed to die and thats what happened. Justify it however you want, there is no secret to his cruelty. Nor is there to Gaddafi. That being said, you cannot argue on the socioeconomic reasons for invasion, and then absolutely define the lack of entrance into Syria being due to the lack of any economic reasons to do so. For one, while we might want it to be over, there is already another armed conflict that NATO is participating in. For the US alone to enter into the battle, Congress would have to allow it - and I doubt they would without just cause - and no, I don&#039;t see that as being financially driven. We have allies, one of those allies is posed to be retaliated on if drastic measures are taken. It is our responsibility to protect that ally, which also includes being intelligent on the fights we pick. Iran is not our friend, and it is definitely not Israel&#039;s friend - but it IS the current Syrian government&#039;s friend. To go to war with Syria, is to go to war with Iran. This is not justified with the current climate. Do I feel horrible for saying this? Absolutely. I feel terrible. How do you value one life, over another though? It&#039;s a difficult decision. What would be the cost of life, if we were to go to war with Syria? Surely it wouldn&#039;t be small by any means.<br /><br />We live in a changing world. The old world, is fading away. This is a change that will affect everything dramatically, and those changes will cause uprising and tension everywhere. It can&#039;t be avoided. We face it here in the US as much as our British cousins face it, and that goes for every other country in the world. It will take different forms, and it will change all of the time, until we move into a new age of understanding. It is not the first time it has happened. In the US, we are facing daily injustices towards our very fundamental rights, and they are getting more agressive by the day. Money is thrown at a system that keeps non-violents locked up and violents free, simply because one of them was carrying some MDMA. We have beliefs that stricter gun control will prevent bad things from happening, and ignore the fact that the people who do bad things didn&#039;t go through gun registration to begin with. We have a government that sells WORKING GUNS to cartels in attempting to trace them, and they turn around and use the guns for murder against law enforcement and civilians alike. We give misdemeanors to kids that get behind a wheel drunk, but we make them felons because they had two blotters. We are a screwed up country, and its only going to get worse before it gets better. Our leaders are from a generation that accounts for a greater percentage OF the generations capable of running, than all of the subsequent adult generations following them, and that generation is only doing &quot;what they think is best&quot; when they still use a clamshell cell phone with symbian 4 on it. It sucks, but - that&#039;s the progress of time. <br /><br />The answer is not petty arguments about how Muslims are agressive, or some Zionist movement conspiracy theory. Nor is it arguing about how one war was a waste when other wars would have prevented suffering. War is suffering, and arguing about how ANY religion does wrong only makes the stereotype worse. Americans will never shed the stigma of religious intolerance, if we continue to emphasize that Muslims are the cause. Muslims are NOT the cause of anything, fanatics are the cause - and fanatics have one truth above all else: They have doubt. They doubt their control, they doubt their confidants, they doubt themselves. The more we blame the wrong thing, and the less we confront the right thing, the more fuel they get and the more support they get, because all we do is prove what they say right. There is no RIGHT SIDE to ANY of these arguments - both sides have demands that are well within their rights, and both sides have actions that are just as wrong. The ONLY right side, is the side WITHOUT HATE and WITHOUT BORDERS. The side with NO sides. We are too intolerant of anything, and until we get past that, we are only seeing the BEGINNING of the pain and suffering.

However, I do support the right of people to keep firearms and use these in self defense. I&#039;ve lived in societies were firearms are more common and others were firearms are strictly prohibited and, imo, the gun-toting places are in many ways much safer. I have lived in the US for a time in a &#039;show cause&#039; state where the gov&#039;t must make the case why someone should not be issued a concealed weapons permits, instead of the citizen having to prove why they should be granted one. Incidence of random crime of opportunity are much lower there, indeed the violent crime rate in London is as high as it is due in large part to criminals knowing they can assume all people are unarmed, and unable to defend themselves (even CS gas is illegal in the UK). And as we saw recently as two Islamists beheaded a soldier on a busy London street with many people watching; when people are doing very bad things, the police are only 20 minutes away (that&#039;s how long these murderers stood in the street dripping in blood waiting for the cops with guns to arrive) For liberty to flourish the state should be a little frightened of its people. Otherwise it will grow and absorb more and more of liberties people once took for granted. The UK is definitely a good example of this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That poor soldier might have been saved and the scumbag killer would probably be dead if a few o those citizens were armed. Cops can only be reactive regarding most violent crime . They can clean up the mess after the fact.
