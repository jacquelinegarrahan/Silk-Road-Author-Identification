				I don&#039;t think ide be to worried about being scammed by a Uk coin seller theres to much money to be made legit(I do use that term loosly),and enough coin to go around so I don&#039;t really see it as much risk at all I&#039;de trust any Uk coin merchant on SR just as much as sites like localbitcoin or bitbargin whicj is a total rip off why would anybody buy a coin for £88 when the Gox price is only £66 to me that stinks of money laundering and you&#039;de all do well to stay away from bitbargin,the coin merchants here offer coin at Gox rates sometime below but never £20 over infact I&#039;ve saw bitbargin selling coins for £140 over Gox ask pricestick with SR coin merchant&#039;s.<br />&nbsp;8)

				Most of these types of transactions ends with the person purchasing the coins saying they got ripped off.<br /><br />SR can&#039;t monitor or supervise these transactions, so you won&#039;t get any help from SR admins if it goes wrong. If you go ahead and do it, do it for an amount that you are prepared to lose.

				If you are in UK you could try FromOneToAnother. They’re currently the biggest bitcoin vendor on Silk Road and has the quickest turn around. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e889d89625 <br /><br />
