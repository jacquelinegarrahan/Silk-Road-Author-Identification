				Apparently the DEA just had their first successful raid on a SR vendor and somehow seized his bitcoins. This may be a honeypot trap so everyone be careful who you are ordering from. Only order from reputable vendors who have been around for a while, do your research here on the forums and NEVER FE!

				It&#039;s likely that the OP is referring to a thread under the &quot;Security&quot; section at:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176347.30<br /><br />with reference to an article located at:&nbsp; *clearnet* http://letstalkbitcoin.com/post/53700133097/users-bitcoins-seized-by-dea<br /><br />The article references a real name as well as an AKA &quot;CaseyJones&quot; - who does/did happen to have a SR Vendor Account in Stealth Mode, although the article itself only references the username and doesn&#039;t mention SR specifically.<br /><br />(I just happened to remember having read that thread a couple of days ago... and not liking it much either).&nbsp; Hope this helps....

				Yes this is now the 4th or 5th thread that has been started on this topic.&nbsp; The rest are located in the security forum since they were moved there.&nbsp; I&#039;m too lazy to link anymore.<br /><br />
