				I stumbled across this site (forums) on a regular Internet Explorer browser &amp; even made my account/posted on that browser.<br /><br />As i did some more research i made my marketplace account through TOR and have done everything on that browser that is SR related since then.<br /><br />Should i be worried that LE can trace my IP address or no? I&#039;m not computer geek as you can see and would like to know if im able to safely continue to use SR without having to worry about it being traced back to me or should i use a new computer.

				Do you realize the odds are against LE to ever catch you? First of all there is nothing wrong with registering on the forums, for all they know you might just be learning about drug safety. The LE will likely not even see you registering for the forums unless they were personally monitoring your connection. By the way it doesn&#039;t matter if you change computers, the wi-fi will use the same I.P again, so why even bother?

Some do advise against accessing clearnet sites at the same time you access hidden services because a fairly powerful adversary could look at the correlation in login times/activity on your SR and Facebook accounts (for example) and reasonably conclude that you&#039;re the same person.<br /><br />It&#039;s not beyond the realm of possibility, I suppose, so it might be a good idea to at least disable the feature that allows other users to see when you&#039;re logged into the forum (enabled by default), and/or avoid Facebooking while on SR. You&#039;d hate to get the two windows confused...
