				With all the recent shit going on with tor and security issues i feel its time to upgrade security and start using tails. However the tutorial on SR is for a windows based operating system. How would a mac user use tails? thanks

				Download tails, burn to DVD, restart Mac and hold down &quot;Option&quot; key, select tails as operating system.

				That&#039;s it.&nbsp; With a Tails DVD, you just boot the Mac, hold down C at boot to get it to boot from CD/DVD and presto.<br /><br />You can try making a bootable USB after it boots, but my bet is that your Mac won&#039;t boot that USB that it makes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apple uses a UEFI boot when booting from USB keys, but supports older methods from DVD, which is why Tails works that way.. <br /><br />Somewhere in the past few weeks, I saw a tutorial on making a USB version of Tails for Mac.&nbsp; Maybe from Reddit, not sure.&nbsp; If I come across it again, I&#039;ll post a link.<br />

				I can confirm that most macs (all?) will not boot successfully from a USB drive without convoluted modification. Burning TAILS to DVD is the way to go. It&#039;s how I did it before I bought a PC.

				Agreed.&nbsp; To use a USB drive you need use third-party software like rEFIT on every Mac you wish to use with your USB drive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Booting from a DVD drive is much less drama.&nbsp;

				Yeah, and even with rEFIT installed it depends on which USB drive you use. It&#039;s a huge hassle. Using a DVD has the added security benefit of being impossible to modify.
