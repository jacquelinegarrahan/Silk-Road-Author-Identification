				It happens with them at times; I&#039;ve had it happen about three times total with BitInstant. However, after speaking with support it was easy to speed up the transaction, generally they would do it that moment. <br /><br />Just my experiences though.

				I ran into some issues with one of my transactions earlier this week, but that was one out of about five. I made one today and it went through fine. Just make sure to email them if it isn&#039;t showing any btc has been sent to your address on blockchain within an hour of paying for it.

				I had this problem it took 16 hours or more to recieve my coin, although theyre service says 30-1h. BUT also I had it sent privately, which I didnt realize that checkbox was active and what it meant being sent through a shared wallet so supposedly that is why it took so long to recieve my coin. I thought they sent it to the wrong account after I mailed them but surely enough the next day it was there. I wanted to use SMS to bitcoin on blockchain but that option is nowhere to be found for some reason although they say it is. Either way when you do it on blockchain make sure that box is not checked on the very first window for private send and that might help you next time. I could be wrong tho
