				Get a Blackberry and use Blackberry messenger whenever possible. Source a sim card from a third world country where they don&#039;t check ID and turn on global roaming. It might be expensive but its as anonymous as you can get.

				It was financed by the Israelis (their main office is in Israel) and the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) and the Mossad uses it. I believe that the U.K Armed Forces and MI5/6 uses it. If it defends the Israelis then I reckon it&#039;s going to be ok, they don&#039;t take no shit. <br /><br />Obviously we had it tested by professionals once we had the trial software. They couldn&#039;t crack it and they are specialists in the field. Now all the people I work with use it. Cost $1700 for a permanent license, easy installation and the conversation delay really is fuck all you can moan about (a few seconds at the most), deffo one to get for anyone serious about the phone security because it gives comprehensive encryption -calls, texts, data transfers-. Be aware though, it only works with phones that also have it so make sure your links have it to. We got a discount because we bought it as a company so all of us can communicate without fear.<br /><br />Seriously recommend it, especially for other sellers.

				Haha Prawl my man you don&#039;t think that&#039;s cheap? I think for what it is they may as well be giving it away! The license is permanent and includes software updates for life, on top of that if you get a new blower then you just transfer the software over to it and the software itself is based on triple cascade encryption. Did you read about how Gold-Lock issued a challenge for hackers to crack the software for $250G? 5000 people entered it and nobody could do it and that was way back in 2009/10.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think Gold-Lock is really necessary for buyers it is an ESSENTIAL for sellers and their suppliers. I pushed my suppliers to use it as well and they love it! :)<br /><br />If you want some more basic kit then go and check out this place: http://www.spycatcheronline.co.uk/ I use it for all sorts and they have land line encryption tools and other bits and bobs and some other pretty cool shit.

Usual price is $1700 dollars but we bought the software for 5 phones all in one go so they knocked off 250 a pop. 5 was the minimum, there were only 4 of us that wanted it so we had to buy an extra phone which wasn&#039;t that bigger deal. You can also pay on a monthly basis I believe.<br /><br />If you check around on the reviews online you can see who else uses it. The soft-ware is getting really big in South America where there are kidnappings etc so businessmen and people like that use it so they can&#039;t be monitored.

				You can buy prepaid phones under fake names with cash easily, no ID required. About that GoldLock thing, I don&#039;t trust anything that isn&#039;t open-source. How do you know they&#039;re not just keeping a log of everything you say?

Like if someone were to just grab my handset, could they read messages that have already been sent?

I&#039;m guessing this is why the Israelis are such big fans of it. :P<br /><br />Cheers for the Karma dude! :)

				The only encrypted Android apps I would trust are Textsecure and Redphone by thoughtcrime industries. Redphone he is porting back to the android store since Twitter bought all their applications when they hired Charlie Miller and Moxie.<br /><br />Also remember Carrier IQ is still spying away regardless of Textsecure.<br /><br />I always assume every phone has backdoors, so never use it for anything important. Every trial I can think of to prove criminal conspiracy played back voice recordings of some gangster who thought his phone was encrypted. Police also like to break into your place and install cameras and mics if that doesn&#039;t work. Maybe cover your place in &quot;security dental floss&quot; to see if it&#039;s been broken. I&#039;d say install your own hidden camera but cops check for those, at least they did in a well known case here before planting their devices

				It depends on your level of risk. First of all, you will never know if your phone is tapped. All phone lines are already &quot;tapped&quot;, LE just needs to activate the link and they can listen to everything you do from any internet connected device.<br /><br />No out of the box, closed source encryption solution is secure, especially if it runs on iOS or Android. The former is certainly the more secure choice, but there are plenty of 0-day exploits floating around that basically nullify the security of the entire operating system, let alone any running programs. iOS is target #1 for zero days, and now that the whole &#039;sploits for cash program has finally been exposed to the public, it shouldn&#039;t be hard to figure out how government agencies and their subcontractors find ways into just about any information system with enough of a market share.<br /><br />This is where that level of risk comes in. See, governments aren&#039;t about to use their precious resource of zero day exploits to go after thugs and crack dealers because odds are they can&#039;t use the same exploit twice. If you aren&#039;t a high level coke broker or something, you will probably be safe with that Israeli thing, a prepaid BBM, cryptophone, etc. Just keep it on you at all times and remove the battery when not in use. Personally, I&#039;d still avoid iOS, android, and Windows Phone unless it&#039;s my personal line. Use the old Windows Mobile 6.5 with appropriate apps in place, a BBM, or something really old for your prepaid &quot;other phone&quot;.<br /><br />The guys at the top can&#039;t really trust anything that claims to be secure. LE is usually aware of these guys and keeps them under surveillance at all times looking for hard evidence. If you have a smartphone, they will know about it and will eventually find some way of cracking into it. That&#039;s why the &quot;kingpin&quot; types are advised, usually by their own IT people, to use old ass prepaid phones that can barely run the OS let alone software of any kind. They buy hundreds of phones and prepaid sims, then have people go around and activate them. Once a phone is used once, they usually just destroy it and start over--every, single time. Crazy thing is, LE and especially intelligence agencies still find a way to monitor these seemingly random prepaid cells. That&#039;s why they still rely on PGP encrypted messages for sending confidential information, either through hand couriers or the internet. The computers they use to view these messages are completely isolated from the internet and watched 24/7 to make sure no one sneaks keyloggers onto them. I doubt there are more than a handful of people associated with SR that need this level of paranoia, but it should give you all something to think about.
