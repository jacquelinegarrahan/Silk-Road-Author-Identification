				I was wondering how I should go about moving my BTC to SR after getting them through coinbase. Should I set up a few wallets and tumble them through?

				Yeah SR has a tumbler built in and even though nobody knows the exact specifics except for DPR himself it is supposed to prevent there being a direct link between the buyer and the seller of drugs.&nbsp; Like say I buy drugs for 1 bitcoin.&nbsp; The seller will receive one bitcoin, but it won&#039;t be MY bitcoin.&nbsp; Therefore no proof of what I bought.&nbsp; However some have said that it can be seen by others that you transfered bitcoins to SR just by following the blockchain trail.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how this is done, but there could be a direct link from your bank account on coinbase used to buy the bitcoins directly to a transfer to SR.&nbsp; I think this is pretty much speculation though from what I&#039;ve read.&nbsp; If it was so easy to track down SR buyers and sellers wouldn&#039;t that have been done a long time ago?&nbsp; I have a feeling the SR tumbler and what happens behind the curtain is very secure.&nbsp;

				Anytime I buy BitCoin from CoinBase, it goes:<br /><br />from CoinBase to a new wallet address on Electrum Wallet (on TAILS).<br />from Electrum Wallet to a new address on Silk Road.<br /><br />If you want to follow the BTC confirmation trail, just plug the wallet address into the search box on www.blockchain.info. As I see it, the only way anyone could know that you sent BTC to SR is by knowing your target wallet address AND knowing that the address is associated with Silk Road.<br /><br />Even then, you can see that I don&#039;t send my coins directly from the provider to SR. The powers that be are cleverer than myself and know many things that I do not... so I have at least one wallet inbetween the transaction.

				Use 2 - 3 anonymous, torified wallets between clearnet &amp; Silk Road--EasyWallet, for instance--and don&#039;t forget to get a new SR BTC address before &amp; after deposits, withdrawals, purchases, etc.

				Didn&#039;t someone recently say that SR uses a certain set of BTC addresses and shuffles them?&nbsp; It would be a problem if someone knew those addresses because then all people sending from an identity-linked address to an SR one would immediately become suspicious to SR.<br /><br />Has anyone ever been able to hunt down all BTC addresses that SR uses?

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think SR re-uses wallet addresses. There&#039;s little point as they&#039;re very simple to generate. It is, however, pretty easy to demonstrate that a particular wallet is being hosted on a .onion server, from what I&#039;ve read. Although not directly linkable to SR, it&#039;s another little bit of inferential evidence leo could use to build a case if possible to be linked to you.
