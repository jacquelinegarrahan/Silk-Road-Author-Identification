				Generally it is the easiest way to get scammed.&nbsp; Bitinstant to tormail.org email via coinapult seems to be the easiest method as of late.

				Well that&#039;s what the feedback profiles are for. It would be very hard to believe the seller created dozens or hundreds of fake accounts just to leave him/herself good feedback. And most sellers/traders have a corresponding thread here on the forums where people talk about their experience using that person. If someone was a scammer, the word would get out quick. On top of that, I have used a few BTC traders myself and have not gotten scammed by ones with good feedback profiles.<br /><br />But their steep fees have caused me to move away from them.

				Well, I don&#039;t know about the bitinstant to tormail email via coinapult method, it sounds like too many steps for me.<br /><br />I just completed my second transaction with Coinbox, using a MP I got with cash at a local convenience store, and this time the coins were in my account in only 23 seconds!!! A whopping 7 seconds faster than my FIRST transaction!<br /><br />So, I guess if you want to wait for all those hops, you can, but for speed and convenience, Coinbox is the way to go!<br /><br />Oh, and fees?&nbsp; No fees...yes, I said it...no fees.&nbsp; Exchange rate was spot on with mtgox.<br /><br />Coinbox is the real deal!&nbsp; Check &#039;em out.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />Omega
