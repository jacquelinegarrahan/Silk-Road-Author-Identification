				High,&nbsp; I am s new member and ready to make some purchases.&nbsp; I have been stumped when it comes to purchasing bitcoins.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what the best way is to purchase bitcoins and transfer them into Silk Road.&nbsp; Paypal has been a complete failure.&nbsp; I think its because of the tor IP address changes.<br /><br />Please. Please. Please.

				I agree it is very complicated to fund your SR account with Bitcoins.&nbsp; I am a new member and would appreciate if a veteran would walk me through how to make a purchase and transfer to SR.&nbsp; Also, how do you find the SR 24 average price?&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to see what the benchmark is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry, to ask to be spoonfed.&nbsp; I am sorry but if someone would help with an explanation, I would be grateful.<br /><br />msg891
