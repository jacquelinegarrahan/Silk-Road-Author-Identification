				@crow3397<br /><br />If you did some testing while you were configuring it for him that included IP address info from connections to your ISP then that might be one way it could come back to u.<br /><br />Also know that each storage device has its own unique serial number.&nbsp; You can see this when its plugged in to your computer, for example under Windows navigate to<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">My Computer <br />-&gt; Right Click the USB drive <br />-&gt; Properties <br />-&gt; Harware Tab and select the USB device from the list <br />-&gt; goto Details tab and navigate to &#039;Device Instance Path&#039; property and you see something like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; USBSTOR\DISK&amp;VEN_KINGSTON&amp;PROD_DATATRAVELER_2.0&amp;REV_1.00001E4FB70682C8C185790999[&amp;0</code><br />where near the end of that device patch &#039;001E4FB70682C8C185790999&#039; is the devices unique serial number.<br /><br /><br />Under Linux you can see it under /proc:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">$ cat /proc/scsi/usb-storage/2 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Host scsi2: usb-storage<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vendor: Kingston<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Product: DataTraveler 2.0<br />Serial Number: 001E4FB70682C8C185790999<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Protocol: Transparent SCSI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Transport: Bulk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quirks: SANE_SENSE</code><br />Depending on your operating system, it may keep a history of devices that have been attached, even after they&#039;ve been removed.&nbsp; Windows will log this info in the registry for example (and possibly other places).<br /><br />Linux may log device serial number info via syslog to be saved in /var/log or whatever if it experiences I/O errors when reports the errored device details (make, model, serial number etc).<br /><br />If you dont want his USB device information appearing on your computer, then probably best to do the install at his place, on his equipment...<br />

Why don&#039;t you point him in the direction of the Liberte Linux website which has some very easy instructions about how to get set up on a USB stick of his own?<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
