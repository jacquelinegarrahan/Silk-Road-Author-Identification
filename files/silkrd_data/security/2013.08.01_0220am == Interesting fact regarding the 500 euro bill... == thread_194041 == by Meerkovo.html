				&nbsp; Since im about to eat, I thought I&#039;d contribute some piece of knowledge to fellow EU members, but keep reading it may also apply to many of you with your currencies. I&#039;m guessing many of you don&#039;t know about Dutch authorities and their creativity, inventions, the whole lot, criminals included. The Dutch always seem to find to ways to crack systems, smuggling routes, technology this, that, you know what I mean, but it don&#039;t stop there, they even make other nations aware of their discoveries thus fucking up a good system which was already in place by an organization. So myself and partner tend to travel there, meet friends, hit up a few sex clubs, you know, have a good time, and almost every time I hear of something of new, of how he got caught, how this happened, etc. Moving on...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;From something I was just reading a couple of minutes about cash mail, big dollar bills having RFID...a story sparked in my mind straight that I heard a couple of months ago, in another city close to Dam. Long story short, this guy was almost clean as a whistle, they didn&#039;t find much on him, but he had named by other people he previously did business who may have been busted or what not. LE went to his house to pay him a visit, you know decent town house and what not, and confident he didn&#039;t have any drugs or anything else incriminating, he let them in. Now with a handheld device, they pinpointed a surrounding area where the stash of cash was. He knew he was in shit but too late, they found a very good amount of all 500s E. An amount I&#039;d be happy to call it a day and never look back. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Saying that, any Dutchman over can confirm this? Not sure if it made the news, but shit went down pretty much as I said. Which raises the other question, what is the possibility that these notes actually do have RFID or some sort, I&#039;m not too much a technical guy.<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				RFID tags can be the size/width of a human hair...I have herd of stories about people wrapping wads of cash(USD) with tinfoil while driving on highways because of the potential for scanning devises at tolls or disguised as traffic sensors....

				That&#039;s absolutely incredible.&nbsp; I looked into it, and they were talking about sizes of 0.4 square millimeters, and 60 microns thick.&nbsp; Yet it still performs the function of receiving a signal, which is used to power the transmitter in the note, and respond with data stored in read only memory.&nbsp; To think some of these RFID tags can run java from power pulled from the air is amazing.

				Alex Jones to the rescue, I know some of his opinions are complete batshit...but the guy does have some relevancy...I herd about the RFID tags in USD about 3 years ago. I would personally suggest anyone driving with currency/storing to wrap it in tinfoil.

				Great tip. Any word on RF tags in USD/other currency or paper bank bands? <br />There are probably special zippered envelopes for discreetly carrying &quot;smart&quot; cash that have lead fibers / faraday mesh in them, like secure passport caddies. <br /><br />Also if you keep your &quot;Smart&quot; money in a safe or even refrigerator it should be rendered invisible by hand held scanners. Unless you are in possession of bills that have been some how radiologically marked...
