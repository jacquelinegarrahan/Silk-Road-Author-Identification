				Not completely sure, but I&#039;ve read mention of instawallet?&nbsp; One thing to make note of with instawallet is that they generate you a URL or something.&nbsp; If you lose the URL you lose your bitcoins; there&#039;s no way for them to get it back for you and I saw a post the other day about someone who said they accidentally closed a tab to the instawallet that they thought they had bookmarked.<br /><br />Apparently they had a pretty big amount of bitcoins in it too which just vanished into the ether when they misclicked.<br /><br />I saw someone else talk about bitcoinfog but I didn&#039;t like the idea of them taking 3-5% or whatever it was in order to mix your coins.&nbsp; Not sure if instawallet charges a fee.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had someone send me an instawallet URL so I could send their payment of bitcoins to my own wallet.&nbsp; Never used it myself other than that.

				instawallet isn&#039;t a mixing service. They just generate an online wallet for you.

				I&#039;ve used bitcoin for before - seemed to be quite good. Shame they&#039;re down.<br />Apparently SR has a mixing service built in. There would be a huge amount of coins in there to mix too!<br /><br />Can we get more information/a link to this from the mods?
