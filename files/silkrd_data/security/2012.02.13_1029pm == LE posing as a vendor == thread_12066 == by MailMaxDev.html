				1. Buy from LE vendor :D located in overseas.<br />2. Have delivery address unassociated to you in any way. If you order small amounts most sellers will send the drugs in envelope so the drugs will end up in mailbox.

				I wouldn&#039;t even worry about that unless you&#039;re ordering serious weight or something. It&#039;s not worth the trouble for them to set up a vendor account to prosecute some dude ordering a few grams of weed or RCs through the mail. To be truly safe, never sign for anything or let them hand the package to you directly. Just let them leave it on your steps or in the mailbox, then open it several hours later. If anything, they would try a controlled delivery and not attempt to get a search warrant at a later date. Maybe if the local cops are involved and you live in some small ass town with strict laws and a budget for that kind of shit, but even then I doubt it. If you get caught making small orders, it will probably be through an informant<br /><br />Now if you&#039;re ordering bricks to your house... uh, good luck lol.

But in the U.S.A. entrapment almost never works as a defence. If it<br />did there would never be reverse stings, but in reality there are reverse stings all the<br />time. To prove entrapment you need to show that LE *pressured* you into doing<br />something that you otherwise *wouldn&#039;t do*. Sending the order request to LE<br />shows that they certainly didn&#039;t pressure you into ordering from them, and <br />participating on a site like SR shows that you normally would order drugs online<br />even if not from that particular vendor, especially if you have ever left feed back on other<br />vendors.<br /><br />entrapment: <br /><br />LE: &quot;Are you low on money? Need to make some money to keep your house? Here move these kilos of coke for us and we will give you twenty thousand dollars!&quot;<br /><br />Random Non Drug Dealer: &quot;I dunno, moving coke is illegal.....I probably shouldn&#039;t&quot;<br /><br />LE: &quot;But think about your kids! You are about to lose your house! Come on you wont get caught!&quot;<br /><br />Random Non Drug Dealer: &quot;I really would rather not....I have never transported drugs in anywhere near those amounts before! Just hooked up friends with weed on occasion....&quot;<br /><br />LE: &quot;Come on it is totally safe and you really need the money!&quot;<br /><br />Ranom Non Drug Dealer: &quot;Okay fine I guess I will just this once since I am in really hard times&quot;<br /><br />LE: &quot;PUT YOUR HANDS UP MOTHERFUCKER&quot;<br /><br />that is pretty much what it takes to prove entrapment in USA. LE needs to pressure you into doing something that you have no history of doing and otherwise would not do.

				roxxo said- &quot;Generally though LE&#039;s resources are focused in taking down larger dealers.&quot;<br /><br />This isn&#039;t true AT ALL. The vast majority of people arrested for drugs are arrested with 1. personal amounts and 2. in their cars. Over 90% of drug arrests occur when people are driving their vehicles. Police have special rules that make searches and search incident to arrest much easier when a person is driving. That said, I&#039;m not worried about getting arrested on SR just yet. It seems they have taken enough precautions and are far enough outside the mainstream computing community that they have gone under the radar so far. This could change at any moment tho. My main worry is the US postal inspector. This type of pig is generally very bored and if they become computer savvy could become very dangerous to the SR community. This is why shipping stealth and keeping these methods under wraps is ESSENTIAL.

				They can definitely arrest you and charge you for attempting to purchase a controlled substance.&nbsp; To my knowledge this hasn&#039;t actually happened on SR, and it doesn&#039;t seem very likely, but it is 100% possible.&nbsp; Just one of the many reasons why new buyers and vendors shouldn&#039;t be trusted until they&#039;re vetted.

				I could just be imagining all of this, but LE might not pose as a vendor themselves, but instead find someone to do it for them. That informant could collect addresses, and send actual drugs in the mail with delivery confirmation numbers. The informant could pass that info along to LE. LE could then inform local LE, who could watch the delivery confirmation number. As soon as delivery is confirmed, LE could quickly go to the residence. I&#039;m not sure but I imagine they could get a warrant for a residence if they knew that a certain quantity of drugs was being delivered in the mail to a certain residence (or just a warrant to open the package itself at the residence). Even if they don&#039;t have a warrant, many people are unaware of their rights and may let them in anyway. Or LE would just talk to the people, and LE can and will lie to get people to incriminate themselves.<br /><br />The vendor also doesn&#039;t have to actually send any package. Once the informant has the address he can inform local LE who could then perform a controlled delivery, or have a postal inspector do it. If people at the address suspect a controlled delivery is happening, they might just think that somehow the package was flagged in the mail system, and not necessarily that the vendor is an informant (especially if the vendor&#039;s user page says they will never ask anyone to sign for a package.)<br /><br />LE might want to wait a long time and gather as many addresses as possible before busting people all at once (although then there&#039;s a risk that people may have moved or drugs are no longer there.) Or LE could find informants who create as many new vendors accounts as they can and don&#039;t worry about negative feedback and bust people as they go. Positive feedback for an LE vendor or informant vendor could be entirely from shills.<br /><br />Some people on here like to believe that LE would never bother with people buying personal amounts, but if that was true than nobody would ever end up in jail for personal amounts of controlled substances. Possession is still a crime. And using the USPS for prohibited mailings (such as controlled substances) is a federal offense. If personal amounts are not a big deal then postal inspectors would not seek to intercept them. LE love drug busts. I found this: &quot;The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will pay up to $50,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals who use the U.S. Mail to distribute narcotics.&quot;<br /><br />People also like to say that the address does not prove who ordered the items, but there&#039;s a reason that LE are interested in known associates of criminals. Chances are that a person at the address knows the buyer. And a few threatening questions may be all it takes for someone to give up a name. Even something as simple as &quot;Has anyone asked you recently if they could send a package to your residence?&quot; or &quot;Has anyone ever mentioned the Silk Road to you?&quot; Even if people at the address don&#039;t talk, LE is now aware of an address that may be connected to illegal drug activity, and it&#039;s now on their radar. And they could ask neighbors to note anyone who visits the residence in the near future, and later do a followup.<br /><br />As far LE budgets go, it&#039;s taxpayer money anyway, and people arrested often have to pay fines, and bail, or will have assets confiscated in asset forfeiture (in civil forfeiture the US government sues the item of property and the owner must prove on a preponderance of the evidence that the property is not subject to forfeiture, even if the owner has not be charged with any crime.)<br />http://www.forbes.com/2011/06/08/property-civil-forfeiture_print.html

				It definitely possible, thought it seems highly unlikely that this would occur, in most instances.&nbsp; Think about it, you&#039;re dealing with two separate situations. First, would local LE in a small CA town spend there limited resources so LE in another state could make a small time bust, for which the department conducting the sting gets zero credit?&nbsp; Second, the Feds conduct a sting for which they have jurisdiction throughout the process, but would they use the necessary resources for a few grams of MJ or a couple of pills? Maybe if it was weight of something like H. Plus even if they make the arrest and controlled delivery, they still have a hell of a time following the money and digital footprints.&nbsp; <br /><br />The biggest thing I would worry about is somebody at the Post office getting a bit curious.&nbsp; I think if somebody on SR does get caught it will be completely by chance.

				Most likely depends on the country&#039;s laws. Most LE won&#039;t take the time to post as a vendor so they can caught a simple user.<br /><br />The problem in United States is that cops get &quot;points&quot; for arrest. Yeah, that&#039;s correct. That&#039;s why they like to arrest marijuana users. They&#039;re not violent and easy to persuade to get a conviction.<br /><br />I recommend Never Get Busted by Barry Cooper (an ex-cop). nevergetbusted.com

				Like someone else mentioned, entrapment won&#039;t work as a defense in the US.&nbsp; There were some cases that already set the precedent for this so you can still get busted even if entrapped by the police.<br /><br />Just curious, where did you get your numbers when you claim that it takes tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to do a controlled delivery?

				Also wondering about those cost figures... LE is typically paid on a yearly salary as far as I know, they don&#039;t get paid more on one day than another no matter how much hard &#039;work&#039; they do. The only time it would start costing them a lot of money is when they have to sit on a PO box 24/7 and then pay out a lot of overtime.

				where i am...if LE smells weed coming from your window they can come in right away. otherwise, its necessary for them to build an adequate reasonable suspicion of illegal activity....like an electric bill that is consistently 3 or 4 times your neighbors in similar size houses. Plus unusual amount of visitors...visitors who have someone waiting in their car. You get the idea....then a judge signs off on it. There was a recent indoor grow operation bust. High electric and maybe an infra red fly over of the house to show unusal heat signature. busted.

Prior to 2010, law enforcement had carte blanche authority to search just about anything and anywhere.&nbsp; Eveen the court recognized that the justification was basically intellectual dishonesty.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow, with the recent Supreme Court decision in Arizona v. Gant, search incident to arrest can occur only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of the arrest, and when these justifications are absent, a search of an arrestee’s vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.<br /><br />Essentially, if you&#039;re removed from the vehicle, you no longer pose a risk to the officer, therefore, they cannot search your vehicle for contraband.&nbsp; Further, and this is the important part, law enforcement cannot search incident to arrest &quot;unless&quot; it&#039;s reasonable that evidence for which the arrestee was arrested for may exist, may be concealed, or destroyed. So, if you&#039;re stopped for driving with a head light out, and you have a pound of coke hidden in the backseat, you&#039;re unlikely to get busted for it, hypothetically, of course... too many variable to list, but you get the picture.<br /><br />If law enforcement does search and recover evidence unrelated to the crime for which the arrestee was pulled over for, the evidence will be suppressed.&nbsp; A first year law student could successfully argue the motion to suppress. The Court is more concerned with our right to privacy than catching recreational drug users. <br /><br />Also, to the guy listing the stats, those number are skewed because of the former search incident to arrest rule.&nbsp; <br /><br />Funny thing is... 80% of searches are consensual.&nbsp; For some reason, people think that when a cop asks to search, you&#039;re fucked.&nbsp; Not so....&nbsp; &quot;or at least that what I was told...&quot; ;D<br /><br />If you&#039;re board, look up the case on findlaw.com - AZ v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009).&nbsp; Google 129 S. Ct. 1710, it&#039;s actually an entertaining read.&nbsp; the Court castigates the police officer.

				The only thing I&#039;m certain of is that there&#039;s boundless room for speculation concerning these issues. It&#039;s hard to know the scale of resources they&#039;re devoting to this site. For now the political pressure to bust this place, and the business model in general, is relatively low I think. You don&#039;t see this place getting roasted on CNN, or politicians actively rallying against it. When that happens I&#039;m headed for the sidelines. They will do something, no matter how big or small. It&#039;s not like they don&#039;t have avenues to bust people on here, it&#039;s only a matter of the juice being worth the squeeze. When public and political pressure mounts, any squeeze will be worth the juice. The time can&#039;t be far. Some high profile douchebag&#039;s ignorant kid will buy some heroin and die or something, they&#039;ll figure out he got it off SR, and the mob will erupt. Come then I&#039;ll wait and see what vectors they take to demonstrate a response, and assess the viability of continued involvement from there.

				I wonder if LE considers the fact SR has effectively eliminated the darker side of the drug trade...?<br /><br />Aside from the possibility of inexperienced users wigging out or (FSM forbid) OD&#039;ing, SR is all positive...<br /><br />OK, yeah. You can add the danger of receiving a substance other than advertised but that issue&#039;s IRL too. Scams? IRL too. Hmm... Maybe LE&#039;s taking a step back and weighing the pros and cons of this little Hamsterdam experiment - but that&#039;s definitely bullshit. <br /><br />Or not.... you know, if its a war on drug *cartels* then the easiest way for LE to win is to let SR flourish - letting the small to medium scale businessman take back the industry.

				A) Not all laws are the same in all places. Since you wrote the post in English, I can sort of guess you are likely from the UK or a former UK colony though, and most of those countries would generally not consider that enough for a warrant. Generally. Most of them. In a really broad kind of way. <br /><br />B) Warrants are issued by judges (again assuming you are talking about one of the British/Colonial nations), and judges are human. They sometime forget what is and is not legal, and thus may issue a warrant every now and then in an illegal fashion. Think about what you do (job, school, hobby, whatever) and ask yourself if you could do it full-time for the duration of an entire career without messing up at least a few times. <br /><br />C) Thus, don&#039;t operate in a way that relies on the law to protect you. Operate in a way that relies on the law being unaware of your existence. If all that is stopping cops from arresting/searching you is a warrant, sooner or later they will either find a judge who will sign it.

				The DEA did once bust a marijuana seeds company by intercepting their outgoing mail, photographing it, and sending the buyers a new letter indicating they had to pay with western union or moneygram to complete the order which was all over the news here about 5 years ago.

				Whoooa, hey, this got off track REAL quick. OP was talking about drugs! <br /><br />And while it is a good point that anyone careless gets pinched, the given example (hookers) lend credence to the contrary - it&#039;s relatively easy to catch a hooker with a john, insofar as you (as a cop) walk in the room and bam, there it is. <br /><br />But think about how much track-covering is involved in even the most Retardo of all sales on SR. Just think about YOUR purchases (if you&#039;ve got any). Even if you didn&#039;t encrypt your address when you made your purchase, there is still a certain amount of shadiness involved, and while it may have been relatively easy to create on your part (install tor, create SR account, get BTC, find product, make purchase = not brain surgery..), it would be quite difficult for law enforcement to reverse the process and tie that shit to you. <br /><br />Note: not IMPOSSIBLE. But ... How much time do you think They (you know, the unknown cadre of People Out To Get You, Specifically?) would devote to investigating that? I have training as a PI and a lot of knowledge of technoshit and I can tell you firsthand that most cops and investigators are WAY too lazy to learn how to do that shit FORWARD, much less learn to do it BACKWARD to find out who you are from ... what, exactly? A BTC chain? <br /><br />Remember, even your encrypted address contains enough reasonable doubt that you wouldn&#039;t be automatically hanged, and it takes a GOOD lawyer to do so. I don&#039;t know how many of you have had the pleasure of being charged with a drug crime but here in the US (where we love to lock up our Humans), you almost certainly won&#039;t see a jury if you are charged with drug possession. And you almost certainly won&#039;t see a prosecutor worth his weight in .&nbsp; . . . . What&#039;s the cheapest thing there is? <br /><br />Point : unless you&#039;re Scarface, the odds are in your favor. Sure They may come after you if you buy a kg of blow or something but... Really ... No. <br /><br />Come on. How big is your ego that you think your two grams of pot is a blip on anybody&#039;s radar? Really. <br /><br />Just my opinion. But I think Our Fearless Leader DPR would probably agree that the reward FAR outweighs the risk. . . Else why would SR exist? Seriously! Just think of the absolutely DAMNING effect even just ONE person saying &quot;I GOT ARRESTED CUS OF THIS SHIT&quot; would have. <br /><br />I saw a post here a while ago saying that law enforcement wouldn&#039;t bust small-time buyers because it would blow their cover, and that instead they would build a name and then make BIG deals to bust BIG sellers/buyers/whatever. That seems very logical to me. Again, as I&#039;ve said before, remember that cops aren&#039;t Terminators! They are people just like you and me!<br /><br />Would *you* care if Your Friend Bill bought an eighth of weed off some website?<br /><br />Stretch that out - how much would it take?<br /><br /><br />Keep that in mind. Obviously SR isn&#039;t without risk but . . . Just like with anything else . . .Be smart, be sane, be safe.

It&#039;s not that they don&#039;t care about minor drug crimes, it&#039;s that this medium isn&#039;t worth their effort or time, when the same time could be put to use getting many more drug busts in person. I can see them trying to go after vendors, or large buyers that they suspect are selling, and possibly busting a few small time buyers just to prove a point or scare people, but in general, I just don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to bother actively hunting the typical SR user who is buying small amounts for personal use.

They aren&#039;t out to get you. Nobody really cares about your gram of weed. The cops aren&#039;t your parents or something... Now, if they pull you over for drunk driving and find a gram of weed in your car, you are going to jail but it was because of the drunk driving not the weed (even though you&#039;ll certainly get charged for the weed). Those people you know who got arrested for a gram of weed or whatever didn&#039;t get investigated because of that - they did something else stupid. <br /><br />As I&#039;ve said on here before over and over, cops are just people like us, and they actually spend most of their time dealing with things like domestic disputes and stuff - things you *would* want cops dealing with. There&#039;s no Officer out there looking for those dastardly buyers of one gram of weed. Just because it&#039;s illegal doesn&#039;t mean they are Out To Get You. It&#039;s a vice crime. Nothing more.<br /><br />Now if you are SELLING shit . . . Different story, because then you are involved in a bigger criminal enterprise. Think hooker vs. pimp. That&#039;s sort of what I was dancing around - I think LE would be way more likely to pose as a BUYER to try to catch a VENDOR than vice versa. <br /><br />Anticipating the counter example of sting operations with cops posing as prostitutes, I have three more points to add before I stfu and gtfo :)&nbsp; &nbsp;: <br />1- It costs nearly nothing for the police to run a sting operation like that. Think about even just the man hours involved in doing that kind of hardcore policing on SR, and remember that (like everything else), law enforcement is a business. It&#039;s just not worth it. <br />2- LEOs aren&#039;t going to pose as a vendor then arrest You for buying One Gram Of Pot for Personal Use. Their cover would be blown right away. They&#039;d be out to catch bigger fish. Much bigger fish.<br />3- The Broken Windows theory: the reason that cops do things like sting operations as prostitutes is a law enforcement tactic to fight against this theory, which explains that a shitty rundown environment breeds crime essentially because it looks like nobody cares enough to rally against it. Counterpoint is that if you clean the area up the crime disappears. It sounds dubious but it works: it explains (at least in part) the massive reduction in crime rates in NYC within the past twenty years. Areas of NYC that were cesspools were rebuilt, repainted, remodeled and renamed and now are chic places to live. &quot;Chelsea,&quot; anyone? <br />So, the idea is that if there is a known hotspot for hookers, you start running sting operations and people get caught hiring hookers, word spreads, people stop going there, hookers go away. Now while the same would be true for IRL drug deals (and, in fact, it is), the fact is that We Are Legion. Just look how many members this forum has. Look how many vendors are on SR. In simple economic terms, it&#039;s just not worth the time and resources to go after the demand-end. <br /><br />Again, supply end, different story! <br /><br /><br />So, while you do raise an interesting (and very true) point that people are in jail for minor drug crimes, I stand by what I said :)

Increasing police powers and power of the state are also points. <br /><br />Sending joe blow to court ordered rehab and getting him on probation paying for piss tests is effective at meeting these goals.

But if you consider the fact that people on SR might be part of IRL networks also, then it gives police the same motivation to go after buyers to move up their IRL chains of supply. And even if you don&#039;t take targeted attacks into consideration, because they are less likely to be aimed at buyers, you also need to take dragnet attacks into consideration. I have zero doubt that buyers here could get caught up in dragnet operations and that customs isn&#039;t going to just ignore the fact that you tried to import MDMA even if it was only ten hits. They will probably just forward the case on to your local police department.

				All very sensible points. I think we just have a difference in opinion though, and it really is an opinion: I feel that LEOs would be way more focused on busting sellers than buyers (which is what I was getting at with the Broken Windows thing, btw) and you think that they&#039;d be trying to do both.<br />&nbsp;<br />I think I may have misunderstood originally and thought you were suggesting that they would be focused solely on picking up buyers (at the exclusion of picking up sellers) because they&#039;d be setting up vendor accounts and busting buyers, but that&#039;s a good point that they&#039;d be picking up the 1g guy to get to the 1oz guy to get further up the ladder. <br /><br />I guess as always it&#039;s a matter of being smart and being sane - i.e., don&#039;t do anything stupid or crazy and you should be okay. <br /><br />Also there&#039;s no amount of ghosting that is too much, so the rotating PO Box idea is a good one regardless of whether LEOs even have a clue what&#039;s going on. <br /><br /><br />... BTW didn&#039;t your link to the Wikipedia page earlier include something kind of suggesting interchange between law enforcement agencies would be all but useless? Using 9/11 as an example? There is cooperation but .... Honestly the NYPD cop is going to kick the TX cop in the head if TX cop calls to report an IP address of someone buying one gram of weed. &quot;QUIT CALLIN&#039; ME!!&quot; :)

				Nah federal police agencies would be involved. If real intelligence agencies gave half a shit about SR it would be long gone, and anyone they wanted busted on it would be busted, customer or vendor. They don&#039;t concern themselves with SR level traffickers, and half the times they concern themselves with drug lord sized traffickers it is to carry out mutually beneficial smuggling operations with them. <br /><br />Federal police do intelligence operations but are generally not considered intelligence agencies, other than maybe FBI. Intelligence agency is more like CIA, NSA, etc, federal police are more like ICE, DEA, etc. FBI is kind of a hybrid post 9/11. But even some local police agencies have intelligence units these days. And really traditional police work is essentially the same thing as human intelligence, they just are generally more restricted by the law in regards to what they can do. For example CIA HUMINT it is probably standard procedure for a sexy agent to fuck someone and start a relationship with them to covertly spy on them, but it is generally frowned upon for local police department to do such things in their undercover operations, although it has happened before (undercover police have started families with surveillance targets before....but it isn&#039;t standard procedure). <br /><br />One of the characteristics of Local LE / Federal LE / Intelligence agency post 9/11 is the bluring of lines between these things though. This is generally recognized by libertarian minded people as &#039;not a good thing&#039;. DEA has a massive international signals intelligence arm, but I dunno if it would be correct to consider them a SIGINT agency. I also tend to imagine that they are about as l33t at SIGINT as the FBI apparently is. <br /><br />http://publicintelligence.net/wikileaks-cables-show-dea-has-become-international-spy-network/<br /><br /><br />http://federatedit.com/services/analyticsupport/dea-sigint<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Project Profile – DEA Signals Intelligence Collection and Analysis (DEA SIGINT)<br /><br />Federated provides expert and experienced Analytic services in the realm of collecting, analyzing, and reporting Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) data through the interception of information promulgated via radio and electronic transmissions. In this effort, Federated personnel monitor, translate, and interpret real time bi-lingual exchanges over related communications equipment such as High Frequency direction finding devices. Based on the raw data extrapolated from various transmissions, our team utilizes qualitative applications of this information and details these findings in tactical actionable intelligence reports. These reports are distributed in an interagency effort that includes Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Intelligence Community (IC) partners and Department of Defense (DOD) organizations to advance and promote shared missions.<br /><br />Federated also contributes to the mission through temporary duty deployments to foreign and domestic locations in support of this operation. Throughout these operations, the duties performed include the conduct of communications intercept operations, site assessments, radio frequency evaluations and the testing of advanced technical equipment in mobile and fixed locations. Our Analysts have received 8 Superior Performance Awards, 7 Special Awards for “Life Saving Actions” and 22 Letters of Appreciation for their timely and accurate analysis of intercepted communications that directly led to thwarting transnational threats.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If the DEA actually had really good SIGINT people working for them, it would be safe to say that they can trace hidden services and do some serious damage against Tor. But even if they have the best people working for them, access to signals matters too. NSA can gather signals from IX&#039;s for their analysts, but DEA analysts would not have such access and would need to resort to other signals gathering techniques. So skill isn&#039;t the only thing involved, so is the ability to position yourself to gather signals in the first place.

				Interesting. All the tactics used by these agencies are probably so far ahead of what we as the public know about that they might border on sounding like madness at this point. <br /><br />Also, good point saying if the real intelligence agencies really cared about SR we&#039;d be toast. Also sad point, wahhh :( <br /><br /><br />... This all just makes me think of Bill Hader as Julian Assange : &quot;Remember: no matter how I die . . . IT WAS MURDER!!!!&quot; :)

They are usually not obligated to release you, but they do under those circumstances. In most cases, it&#039;s called &quot;parole,&quot; but not in all cases and not in all states (it varies a lot, and if you get into other countries it gets even more complicated). <br /><br />The short version is that if the prison says &quot;you can leave now as long as you submit to ___ conditions for ____ amount of time,&quot; you can say &quot;no,&quot; and stay in prison. Or you can say &quot;yes,&quot; and waive your rights. Those laws are considered legit in this era, because it&#039;s a civil contract between you and the government rather than a conviction. You theoretically have a choice (not really, but ya know, theoretically). <br /><br />&quot;Ex post facto&quot; means if they you get caught with aspirin tomorrow, which is legal, and then next week they ban it, they can&#039;t arrest you for what you were caught with last week. It was legal then. They would have to catch you with aspirin again for it to result in a conviction. <br /><br />All this applies to the USA only, and more or less has not been accurate since the 1800s, but on paper it&#039;s still the law of the land.
