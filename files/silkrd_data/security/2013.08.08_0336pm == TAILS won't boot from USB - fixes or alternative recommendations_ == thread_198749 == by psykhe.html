				I&#039;ve been trying to get TAILS working and whilst it boots from the DVD drive it will not boot from USB at all. I receive an error message saying &quot;Operation not found.&quot;<br /><br />Having googled it, it seems to be a common fault they&#039;ve known about for over a year, with no fix that I can find. Apparently if you manually install TAILS to USB rather than using the &quot;Clone &amp; Install&quot; option, it will boot, but you cannot use the persistence feature.<br /><br />Does anyone know of any fixes to this?<br /><br />Alternatively, can anyone recommend any other type of secure amnesiac system? I&#039;ve been using Liberte but am not particularly fond of it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />psykhe

				Both the manual install, and the one that&#039;s cloned with option for persistence work perfectly for me,<br /><br />What don&#039;t you like about Liberte? I preferred it to Tails.

I&#039;m a linux newbie, but I believe that part of the manual method on their site involves downloading an installer of some description.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing *wrong* with Liberte, I just prefer the interface of Tails, as well as the fact it seems to run faster and smoother than Liberte, which often seems to cause my laptop to overheat. Tails seems to be far more user-friendly with a nicer UI. But it&#039;s mostly because of the performance issues I have with Liberte.

				i got tails to work with persitense by booting off a dvd, then useing the usb function under applications - tails, once its booting from usb go once again under applications - system tools. i&#039;m sure you did, but i have to ask, did your change your boot order under bios?

Other USBs will boot automatically (such as Liberte), so the boot order is definitely right. I also tried to manually load it from the USB using the boot selector menu.

				I am having the same problem. Works fine if the USB is created with windows, but if it is made from tails (with or without persistance) it will not boot!<br /><br />I have almost given up at this point, but really hope that you find a solution. <br /><br />Have you checked if you get any windows error reports whenever the PC fails to boot the tails USB (I seem to get something about Illegal OPmemory region, or something)?
