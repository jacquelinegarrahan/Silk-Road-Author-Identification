				I should say that Bitinstant isnt actually ripping people off, so much as deposits are going missing then you have to follow support channels for days or weeks to resolve it. But they are in fact making good on it.I went 2 weeks, then after finding the right thread, I had my deposit in a few days.&nbsp;

				Iv never had any issues with Bitinstant. I dont like what iv been hearing , its the only place iv ever used to get my coins, So if i must i will just use Sugar Moma for coins..<br /><br />I dont have certain banks in my small town oher than our local state type banks, now about hour from me there&#039;s BOA and all, but it sucks having your DRivers L suspended, with bitinstant, im 10 min away from buying coins, i always buy 200 at one place make sure that went through then will go to another and do the same, thn soon as i hit sr i buy everything i need, i normally put the amount of money with bout 40 xtra just in case, i never just keep thousands on here for shopping around daily..<br /><br />I just went today and bought 2 100 $ money paks for a btc vendor, And i was waiting to see at least a week if we were gonna be ok and hold up before i threw 400 on here, Glade i did.. seems like issues ATM, lets hope just some upgrading to hardware and software on the teams end.. We will survive, but we will always have major storms here on SR soo understand that..

				If you can get an early order in, Blue Sky Traders works well, and up to $8500 per transaction. Only problem there is that they work Tuesday through Friday, from 11:00am until banks close. They also only work when the market is going up. They have been increasing their business, so catching them when they are open almost never works. You have to send them an email requesting an early order. If you know early enough, I would place the order two days in advance, or in the am the day before.

				So from what I have heard, it sounds like multiple bitcoin exchanges are having all sorts of problems(attacks, deposit issues and being shut down by their banks), SR is under attack, TOR is under attack(just heard, not confirmed yet)......anything else I&#039;m missing?&nbsp; <br /><br />Sounds like the counterculture is doing well.&nbsp; They are paying attention, guys.&nbsp; <br />

The DDOS is (possibly) exploiting a vulnerability of Tor (rather than a vulnerability of Silk Road&#039;s).&nbsp; The implications of this are that it is possible the DDOS cannot be stopped without a patch to Tor hidden services code. In other words there would be nothing DPR or other admins could do. I think we all hope this is not the case.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Saying &quot;Tor is under attack&quot; really doesn&#039;t make sense at all.

				Alright, check it out SR Fam.&nbsp; The acquisition of bitcoins has always been a sickening task in my opinion.&nbsp; Avoiding MP scammers, tedious WU and Moneygram forms, the waiting, the uneasy bank visits, researching SR BC vendors, Ive done it all.&nbsp; We all have right.&nbsp; Bitfloor, Bitcopia, Bitinstant, Bitstamp, Blue sky traders, blah blah blah.&nbsp; Today I jumped out there and tried localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; I found a vendor who didnt overcharge me and was on the up and up.&nbsp; Moving forward I have direct access through Bank Deposit.&nbsp; Dude only charged me 1% and my coins were delivered within a half an hour more or less.&nbsp; I am very pleased and relieved that&nbsp; &nbsp;i found this resource and can only hope that my fellow bitcoin brethren here on SR can find someone similar to the connect I met today.&nbsp; Have a nice day.

I POSTED it in the official spare coin thread<br /><br />I think its CLEARNET WARNING ! www.lendmecoin.com &lt;&lt; not positive but u can find it by me on the spare coins thread.. I got a 300 dollar loan one time and was only charged 1% a day til i paid it back, i think i ended up owing 325 bucks or something i cant remember, the site was still in Beta when i met the guy putting it together but i clciked something for free on his page so he could see my stats. then he asked how much i wanted. Told him and within 5 min i had it.. most iv seen somne get charged is 2%

				Getting coins is a real pain in the but. BitInstant wants my name, age, and phone number. Local BTC are all strangers and Sugar Mama is on vacation. Besides, SR BTC vendors are way too expensive, and BlueSky is always several days out just to get started. How much more business could DPR realize if it wasn&#039;t such a risk and pain in the ass to get coins. I have cash and I spend much more time getting it to SR than I do reading the forum. Surely SR coin vendors could use our SR longevity and purchase stats to adjust their rates more favorably for more senior SR buyers. Blah, blah, blah, ...<br /><br />DPR, please apply your genius to solving this conundrum! <br />

				That would be a pretty big security risk if SR had its own BTC exchange. But it sure would be convenient. <br /><br />Don&#039;t see how it&#039;s possible though. The site is too big of a target. Adding a BTC exchange ran by DPR and co, would be an Achilles heel.

				I haven&#039;t heard collapses name mentioned at all. He is the only one I use for my bitcoin purchases, EVER. I have tried one other guy when collapses wasn&#039;t around and he overcharged me big time, but I needed the coins at that point so what are you gonna do..<br />My point is, COLLAPSES is the way to go. His rates are either great or reasonable, depending on what you&#039;re accustomed to, and you can use Western Union or Moneygram, again depending on preference, aaaand the whole transaction takes literally only a couple of hours.<br />In my opinion, a seriously fantastic vendor for all of your bitcoin needs. Absolutely worth checking out.

				BitInstant has always worked for me. I have seen some stories of people who&#039;s bitcoin orders got messed up for one reason or another. Usually error on the part of the user. (wrong btc address, email address, etc) though a few have been honest to goodness &#039;glitches&#039;<br /><br />Part of me want&#039;s to shy away from threads like this. After all, if it&#039;s working for me, who should I shout and yell about it? Right?<br /><br />It&#039;s like discovering gold, and wanting others to share in your joy, only to find they have a whole other twisted logic as to how the gold should be used.<br /><br />Our biggest enemy is human nature. <br /><br />BitInstant is just fine in America. - (you have many options for locations AA! Can&#039;t remember how long it&#039;s been since I saw BOA on there, maybe 6 months?)

				Pardon my sensible paranoia Mr. Hero member. When I&#039;m asked to give my name, age, and phone number I worry that someone is harvesting bitcoin buyer trends and personal info.

				No.<br />There is Nothing Wrong with buying and using Bitcoins.<br />There are quite a few websites that use Bitcoins as a payment method that sell &quot;Legal&quot; Stock on<br />their WebStores.....Also look at the Gambling websites which take and payout in Bitcoins...<br />They&#039;re not illegal to purchase or own.<br />We all must Formulate a plan in case something goes down where we&#039;re questioned...Before We hit the Silk Road<br />and make orders....We should really Educate Ourselves on PGP and the finer points of Anonymity.<br /><br />As long as we can prove how we use these Bitcoins in a Legal way...i see no harm in using Our Real Names<br />and or DOB&#039;s . <br />Seriously..now this is just my opinion&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br />Plausible Deniability is Always on my mind&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />Hope this has helped someone&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				As far as bitcoin traders on SR, everybody seems to go to Sugar Mama, but I bought from JumboMonkeyBiscuit, who charges a little bit less (15% vs SM&#039;s 20%). He was super helpful and I got my coins in like 5 minutes just when he was about to turn in for the night. And he has 100% positive feedback, so this is definitely a good option, especially since Sugar Mama is on vacation. I really think these BTC vendors charge way too much, but these are desperate times and there are few other options now.

				CampBX<br />If you have Dwolla account and money in there, it takes less than 6 hours to show up in CampBX as cash and costs 25 cents! Then you buy from CampBX exchange and send to whatever wallet you want. Prices are typically comparable to Mtgox +/- 3% (They charge 0.55% transaction fee). Tumble them a few times or move b/w wallets then send to SR for anonymity. I keep $ in my Dwolla and can purchase BTC, wash, and send to SR w/in 1 hour usually.

				Any dwolla linked coin exchange is about to have a hard time getting their money. The U - S&nbsp; Gov is cracking down on the cash flow to and from these exchanges that operate in U - S- D. Just an FYI...... We do charge a fee for our service but we are legit and to be legit it costs us money to operate. <br /><br />
