				Do those who have high dollar volumes leave the money in there SR account or transfer it out of here into another holding account like mt Glox? I ask beacuse if SR ever goes down your money would be gone. <br /><br />On a side note is there a link someone can provide how to cash out BTC into Hard Cash anonymously? i have been reading the how to use SR anonymously thread but have not figured out how to cash out should one need to.

				I would advise having a wallet outside of silk road.&nbsp; This way if it ever goes down you won&#039;t lose out.&nbsp; You can go into account settings and provide silk road with an outside wallet address.&nbsp; This way if the site ever does go down they will have a place to send your coins to you.&nbsp; If you go ahead and create an outside wallet for this purpose then you might as well use it all of the time.&nbsp; I would advise using blockchain.info.&nbsp; If you go to that address via TOR or clearnet the site guides you through the entire process.&nbsp; Pretty simple.&nbsp; I would highly recommend doing this.

				thanks Wet Dog. Anytime somethign&nbsp; comes into my SR account funding wise should I create a new account number so to speak? i know there is a tab inside your account to do something like that.. Thus its not traceable to multiple amounts of $$&nbsp; coming in. Sorry if i used the wrong term there.

				Most people suggest that before you send funds to your SR account, always get a new BTC address.<br /><br />It only takes a second, and does make it more difficult to record a &quot;pattern&quot;.<br /><br />If you are a low traffic customer, it is probably overkill, your real risk is receiving the product.&nbsp; Dealers etc would be more at risk to money trails etc (that is how a lot of the old mafia got busted via taxes and money trails).&nbsp; <br /><br />Yet it is sooo easy to do, you may as well change it every deposit.
