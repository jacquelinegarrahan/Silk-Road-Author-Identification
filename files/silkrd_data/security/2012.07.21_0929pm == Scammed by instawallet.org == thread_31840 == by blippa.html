				Ok, bitinstant seems a bit better. It can deposit directly to a bitcoin address so that&#039;s nice.<br /><br />If one goes through bitcoinfog, is it then safe enough to use your credit card in the first place?<br /><br />Can you elaborate on &quot;flip&quot; please:)

				it can be like a simple rotation of the bit transfer just in case u want to feel that extra reassured, so like for example i open up an address like on SR or wherever and brand new with no transaction history as the receiver of the transfer from you deposit, then you can send from that address to your regular address you normally use or where you really want the coins to be saved on, thus a &quot;flip&quot; from one to another, if you want to get tech savvy, you can use different computers and usb&#039;s with your Tor browser AFTER you completed the transfer , to go shop on whatever u need your coins for.

				So I gave up on my 30 coins through Instawallet –&nbsp;that wallet is still empty. Interesting that.<br /><br />My next try is bitinstant (cash at bank) -&gt; bitcoinfog -&gt; SR<br /><br />Bouncing more before hitting SR seems moot. Do people use two tumblers sometimes? SR tumbles too, so it&#039;s seems pretty well tumbled:)<br /><br />Call me a gambler, but I&#039;m upping the stakes for this round.

				You might be reading blockchain.info wrong. You&#039;ll see numerous transfers out of your existing Instawallet account and this is completely normal. It does NOT mean someone is stealing your BTC&#039;s. All you need to verify is that blockchain is reporting your transfer to your instawallet address AND that there are two confirmations. The BTC won&#039;t show up in your instawallet account until there are two confirmations.<br /><br />If you&#039;re still having issues contact instawallet support and I&#039;m sure they will help you out as long as you definitely sent it to the correct address.

				Should I see transfers out if I never transferred anything out of Instawallet? Would love to know how I&#039;m reading it wrong. Do they withdraw from the receiving address and put into some other internal address? I guess it&#039;s not prudent to post a link to blockchain here.<br /><br />So with my most recent test:<br /><br />bitinstant –&gt; bitcoinfog -&gt; SR<br /><br />I&#039;m seeing something terrible on blockchain again. For every small amount that bitcoinfog puts in, there is a withdrawal for the same amount a few minutes later. This is for the SR wallet. I have only accessed SR through Tor on this computer.<br /><br />Are there trojans and other hacks in circulation that might compromise my computer?<br />

				instawallet always works fine for me (as a wallet, not a mixer)<br /><br />it seems you either sent your coins to the wrong address or else the link has been comprised and someone else has access to your wallet, but it tells you the last time it was visited. not exactly secure.<br /><br />but instawallet is not scamming you as you claim in your title...

				So I have learned now that it is normal for a receiving address to pass on to another address. Every coin I sent to my SR account has shown up properly in SR, even though if I look at blockchain it looks like they were taken out after they were deposited.<br /><br />I&#039;m presuming that SR internally transfers from one wallet to another, and the public-facing key does not actually represent &#039;your&#039; wallet. Rather, it is just a temporary receiver.<br /><br />It still remains though that my instawallet.org balance is not showing up on instawallet, even though blockchain is showing that the funds were taken from the receiver key. If they had support I would ask them.<br /><br />

				i copied and pasted this response to the wallet scam:<br /><br />This glitch executable file steals the wallet.dat file from the victim&#039;s computer and send it to your email as an attachment. When the file is executed there is no indications and no visible activity, but in background the thief sends the file to you.<br />There is an option to hide the thief in another executable file and What is required:<br />a working email account. In order to work, the thief requires email account which supports smtp. The wallet.dat file will be sent on that email account.<br /><br />how they get you: they can send them via email or make a torrent with the thief or they just setup a webpage with download link,whats messed up is that this thing spreads depending on how they use it.<br /><br />And when it all boils down to it, its who knows you and if you trust the people around you
