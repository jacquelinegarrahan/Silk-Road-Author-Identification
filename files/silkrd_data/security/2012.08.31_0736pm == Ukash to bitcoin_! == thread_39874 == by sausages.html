				+1, and I think we speak for many other UK people. Getting hold of BC&#039;s anonymously is a pain now that Vlad has gone. I don&#039;t do bank transfer thanks very much.<br /><br />Is there any way to do cash deposits for BC&#039;s anywhere?

				You can deposit to an Mtgox account with cash at Barclays. It can take up to 3 working days but is normally credited next day. If you&#039;re serious about buying anonymously you want to:<br /><br />- use a self service till as it&#039;s harder to link your deposit to any CCTV footage<br />- don&#039;t write your name on the paying in slip, it&#039;s not mandatory<br />- don&#039;t withdraw your cash from the ATM in the bank foyer and pay it straight in<br />- withdraw your BTC to a tumbling service before transferring to your SR wallet - there is plenty of advice on this in the forum<br />- mtgox must be accessed via clearnet. You&#039;re best doing this from a free wifi zone so your IP cannot be linked<br /><br />Hope this helps, let me know if you need any advice

Very useful. Are they definitely still accepting cash though, as I read on another thread they are stopping.<br /><br />@ sausages....I meant I don&#039;t do bank transfers to any company for bitcoins. I know it&#039;s not illegal and all that, but I don&#039;t like any undue attention.

				Mtgox site isn&#039;t very clear regarding cash deposits at Barclays - one section states not to deposit cash as it may not be credited, another section states they will accept cash but at a 1.5% fee. <br /><br />In my experience they have never lost a cash deposit, nor have they started charging the 1.5% fee. Sometimes a deposit is not credited to your account immediately and that happens when Barclays don&#039;t enter the Mtgox reference in the correct format i.e. capital letters at start and end with no spaces. This is normally sorted by raising a support request at Mtgox.<br /><br />Good luck if you take the Mtgox route<br /><br />Edit to add a caveat - just because I&#039;ve had no problems with cash deposits, they are not foolproof so never deposit more than you can afford to lose. Although MTG are a legit site you&#039;re still paying cash to a company based in Japan for intangible goods so no prospect of recourse if you get burnt. Despite the potential pitfalls, it&#039;s gotta be a better bet than posting cash to some random gobshite on t&#039;internet :)

				Thanks for your advice mrblunt. +1 coming at ya :) <br /><br />Still not sure what to do though. The mtgox site doesn&#039;t seem to explain much at all. Unless it becomes clearer when you have an account. So the search for clean and easy BC&#039;s continues....

I&#039;d guess thats why no one else has posted how to do it,okpay once accepted ukash and no longer do because of that<br /><br />fastonion @ tormail&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;send mail to check if Im online

				gaia,<br /><br />Thanks for the +1 :) Mtgox isn&#039;t too difficult once you have opened an account. If you want to know how to deposit cash at Barclays and w/d BTC I can explain from start to finish - just post up or drop me a PM. Maybe try opening a test account and just depositing a couple of quid until you know how it works. <br /><br />Bearing in mind the recent scam, please be careful when paying an individual upfront for BTC either by Ukash or cash in mail etc. <br /><br />Goldwing - this comment isn&#039;t aimed specifically at you as I&#039;ve no reason to doubt your honesty, please don&#039;t take offence! However in this game you can trust nobody but yourself and you will minimise the risk of loss by purchasing your BTC through am established exchnage rather than an anon person on the internet.<br /><br />mr bump<br /><br />

				26/09/2012<br /><br />***WARNING - MTGOX ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ACCEPTGBP DEPOSITS VIA BARCLAYS BANK. DO NOT DEPOSIT CASH OR BANK TRANSFER TO BARCLAYS TO YOUR MTGOX ACCOUNT***<br /><br />I have left the below info posted as mtgox may be able to resolve their Barclays issue and it still may be relevant if they start accepting deposits again.<br /><br />mrbump<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been asked to post a few more details on how to get cash into Mtgox via Barclays and out to SR as BTC. Here is a quick rundown from start to finish.<br /><br />1) Open account at mtgox.com. You must NEVER USE TOR to access mtgox as it will lead to your account being frozen and ID requested to release any funds. I would advise you always access it via clearnet using a public wifi network, or any network that cannot be linked back to you. <br /><br />If you&#039;re using the account purely for depositing cash and withdrawing BTC you should use a false name and a new email address for registration. Choose a mundane and believable name :)<br /><br />2) Login to your new mtgox account and you should be presented with the main screen with a list of links on the left. Select &quot;Funding Options&quot;<br /><br />On the next page select &quot;Add Funds&quot; and then &quot;GBP Deposit (UK)&quot; from the dropdown box.<br /><br />Scroll down and you should see mtgox bank details. I have removed the&nbsp; section for IBAN / BIC as they aren&#039;t relevant. <br /><br />Account Name: TIBANNE LIMITED<br />Bank Name: BARCLAYS<br />Sort code: XX-XX-XX<br />Account number: XXXXXXXX<br />Message:&nbsp; MXXXXXXXXX<br /><br />3) Take a copy of the above details. You are now ready to deposit cash into your mtgox account. <br /><br />To pay cash into mtgox Barclays account you will need to complete a Barclays paying in slip. Fill out the following sections:<br /><br />Date <br />Amount of cash and denominations<br />Account name - TIBANNE LTD<br />Sort Code - from mtgox <br />Account Number - from mtgox<br />mtgox reference in the format MXXXXXXXXX. It is important you leave no spaces and use capitals for any letters. This reference is used to allocate your deposit to your account so it is crucial it&#039;s entered correctly. <br /><br />There is no need for you to fill in the section for your name.<br /><br />When paying in it&#039;s sensible to take a few precautions and remember you&#039;re always on candid camera! Don&#039;t withdraw your deposit money from the ATM in the bank foyer. Get your paying in slips / deposit envelopes in advance and fill them out at home so you don&#039;t have to spend so long in the branch. If you&#039;re super paranoid get someone else to fill in the slips so you cannot be identified by your handwriting. If you regularly bank at Barclays don&#039;t use your home branch for obvious reasons! Always and use a busy branch with a deposit box so you don&#039;t have to pay in at the counter with a cashier. If you need to deposit a large amount try and use multiple branches and mtgox accounts.<br /><br />Now it&#039;s just a case of waiting for the cash to appear in your Mtgox account. This can take up to 3 working days but normally shows within 1 or 2 for me. If the deposit isn&#039;t showing after three working days raise a mtgox support request with details of the deposit. <br /><br />4) Now you have GBP in your account it is time to buy some BTC. On the screen after logging into mtgox select &quot;Trade&quot;. For simplicity I&#039;m just going to cover buying at market rate so ensure the &quot;Market Order (buy/sell at market price)&quot; tickbox is selected. Enter the amount of GBP you want to convert and hit &quot;Buy Bitcoins&quot;<br /><br />Your order will be executed immediately and the BTC value will update in your mtgox wallet. <br /><br />5) To withdraw your BTC select &quot;Funding Options&quot; from the main menu and then &quot;Withdraw Funds&quot;. The next screen should present a dropdown with &quot;Bitcoins&quot; as the withdraw method. Enter the value in BTC you wish to withdraw and the BTC address to send to. When you&#039;re sure you&#039;ve entered the correct address hit &quot;Confirm&quot;<br /><br />You can withdraw straight to your SR BTC address or anonymise the transaction further by using tumbling services and instawallets etc. There&#039;s already loads of info on this in the forums so I won&#039;t go into it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope this is helpful. In my opinion a lot of it is overkill if all you&#039;re doing is making small / infrequent deposits as I doubt LE would invest the time and money on small time drug purchases, but if you are worried it can never hurt to take too many precautions, if only to set your mind at ease.<br /><br />If I&#039;ve missed anything or anyone has any suggestions or better methods please post up :)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />mrbump

				Gox is probably the most reliable and trustworthy exchange us Brits still have to get BTC, 3 days max and you will guaranteed have your funds but it will leave a paper trail if you use Bank Xfer and even if you direct deposit there are still the camera&#039;s.<br />There are a number or vendors on bitcoin-otc and Bitcointalk forum marketplace that will exchange Ukash vouchers, Prepaid Visa or Cash in the Mail for BTC and they are highly repped and trusted (Always check out the vendors history first!) or maybe even a someone you can do a cash trade with on Local-Bitcoins.<br />Stay away from anon-xchange though, there&#039;s been talk of them selective scamming on different boards.
