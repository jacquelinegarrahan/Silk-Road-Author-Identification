				Without going into details, lets just say I live somewhere in Canada in a freaking igloo. This is the 3rd new account that I have been forced to open this last week: despite not forgetting my username and passwords I am unable to sign in. When I am prompted to enter my e-mail address (which is at Tor mail) for a new password it doesn&#039;t show up there.I am beginning to become a wee bit paranoid: it seems like my accounts are being disabled by the forum or a third party (LE or in Canada the RCMP). I doubt that the Forum is responsible b/c I haven&#039;t done anything to violate the guidelines (note to the administrators: if you have disabled 2 accounts within the last week please contact me). I am beginning to suspect that I am being watched by LE. I am also a member of another web-site called Drugs Forum and my account has been disabled there as well (despite not forgetting sign-in details). Has anyone else had this problem or am I just being paranoid? Any advice on how I might address this issue? Do I need to beef-up my security or encryption? Thanks!&nbsp; :o

				funny you mention the email thingie... i never was able to enable topic reply notifications via email. also noticed the option to change display name is missing from my profile settings.<br /><br />are you by any chance using tor browser package? perhaps you need to enable scripts for some of the functionality of the website to work...

				1. I don&#039;t think SR sends &#039;change your password&#039; emails, they assume any email you give them is bunk, it says as much when you register if I remember rightly.<br /><br />2. Drug Forum. That rings a bell, DZF? Some people were saying it&#039;s a honeypot.<br /><br />3. Did you use a same or similar password/handle at the other forum?

				I&#039;m just curious why you think LE would disable your accounts? And Pine is correct, it does say to enter a bunk email address when you register.

Yeah the bunk e-mail thing for SR makes sense. With re: to Drugs Forum, no I was using a different handle/password. I think your comment re; Drugs Forum being a &#039;honeypot&#039; is an interesting one since that site doesn&#039;t have any form of on-line security (like Tor). They just request that peeps not talk in the &#039;first person&#039; when documenting drug experiences: but nonetheless users are exposing their identities on that site unless they are undertaking their own security measures. Would you happen to have any links re: Drugs Forum as a &#039;honeypot&#039; site? I could see it being a goldmine for LE. Thanks again.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />p.s. my paranoia may be dues to the fact that my &#039;pet monkey&#039; has been doing some quality meth and awesome racemic K lately : a mere 25 mg line sends him into many infinite K holes LOL&nbsp; :o

There&#039;s a few other interesting references too.<br /><br />Don&#039;t trust clearnet drug forums, half the people on them think SWIM is a legal concept or something.
