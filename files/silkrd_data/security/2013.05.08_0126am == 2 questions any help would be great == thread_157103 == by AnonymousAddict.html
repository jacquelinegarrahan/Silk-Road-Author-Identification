				Ok <br />1. Im going to be putting about 1500 to 2 grand of coins on soon. But NO WAY am i sending it all to SR. I have a e wallet address on blockchain but thats not very secure cause of the crash and all. What i plan on doing is adding all the cash to a Off site wallet, then sending money to SR as needed. Which will ne spent in about 2 weeks but i dont trust the site the way its been to put that on here,<br /><br />So can someone tell me a good site or setup so i can put that amount of cash in a wallet? Besides Tails.. Iv got several USB&#039;S so plan is to put it on there then encrypt it..<br /><br />2nd question. Iv always used Bitinstant, 400 is the most as we know we can add, But they have been sketchy is a nice word lately. Im considering BST for sure.. But i cant seem to find their damn website. Iv gone to their vendor page and copy and paste their site into my TOR broswer but it doesnt work. Am i missing something?<br /><br />thnks members

				Ok, I&#039;ll give you my 2bit advice.<br /><br />1. Well, if you are going to put it on a usb then you should just use the regular bitcoin client. As for third party services you could use any number of selfish clients like electrum.<br /><br />2. Bitinstant gets lots of flack because their customer service is sloooow, however they are pretty dependable most of the time.. I myself have never had a problem. Even if you do have a problem their company heads seem pretty active on the bitcoin forums, just complain on there and within hours they will usually notice and help you out it seems. <br />Also with bitinstant you can just make multiple orders under the same name for three slighty different amounts (i.e. 500, 497, 494) at the same time and the orders will process together. Your limit per deposit is 400-500 bucks, but your daily limit with bitinstant is $4000 altogether. So you could actually get your coins in one trip.<br />I just looked up bsk, they are sold out through the middle of this month... the link worked fine for me.<br /><br />Anyway, hope that helps&nbsp; :D<br />
