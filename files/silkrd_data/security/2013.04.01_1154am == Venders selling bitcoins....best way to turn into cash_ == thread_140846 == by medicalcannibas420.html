If sellers are actually giving up 15% just to be able to withdraw their earnings, it&#039;s obvious why everything on SR is so expensive.<br /><br />There&#039;s a tradeoff between anonymity and low fees. You can&#039;t really have both. I would never use WU or MG though.

I am all for cash in the mail but you can also use sites like coinabul to directly buy gold bullion for Bitcoins.<br /><br />If that&#039;s not your cup of tea I suggest you use the locabitcoins website and see if you can contact one of the established traders in your area to sell Bitcoins for cash in hand. This is the method I use, feel free to PM me for details<br /><br />V.

				If you want anonymous cash for the coins,<br />Good folks here:<br />https://cryptocurrent.com/<br /><br />Communicate with them thru email. No need to mention SR or any details of where the coins came from. I believe these trades are legal unless you say the wrong thing or do too much without proper reporting. They are hip to whats up though.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t care if it is anonymous, there are many options as it is not illegal to trade Btc for dollars.

				I had just received an email from crypto pretty recently stating I could get a 2% rate instead of 5% this next run around, and sorry for the delay (I was due for an order today). Could this be highway robbery? :O<br /><br />Doubt it, but who knows. I really do :X

				another vender said that the normal price was 5% and they did a deal and then cryptocurent said it would be 10% in that post that he deleted.. find out before you do anything from Fred to see whats going on i would hate for anyone to loose money even though cryptocurent is a great option for all of us. to many shady cams going on in the last month!

				Crypto&#039;s fees may depend on whether Btc are crashing or soaring when you go to sell some. If noone else is complaining about them, I think they are still trust-able and can provide very low fees when the coins are rising. Good to be careful though.

				The thread was here in normal forums and was removed. I don&#039;t know if the OP removed it or someone else. I would expect Fred to comment here if he had his thread removed against his will? Not sure. Last I read he was trying to work it out with Crypto.. Unless someone is censoring his posts, I&#039;d expect we will hear from him again after that process.
