				I apologize if this is a noob question, but it wasn&#039;t covered in the buyers guide. I am interested in making my first purchase off SR, but when filling in a delivery address to make an order do you need to encrypt it with the sellers pgp key? I don&#039;t see why not but I wanted to clarify that this was common practice.

				Yes normally you will want to encrypt your address at the purchase screen.<br /><br />1st check the sellers home page. If they show you their PGP key, its usually safe that you can do encryption for all communications, including your address and name etc.<br /><br />If I could only encrypt just *1* detail here at SR I would choose it to be name+address.... everything else is secondary to that.<br />

				If you don&#039;t encrypt messages don&#039;t discuss things in too much detail. Write like it&#039;s a public forum. It&#039;s a good idea to use for PGP for sensitive information. I use it whenever I can because every extra layer of protection helps.

You may not get in an accident today or tomorrow, or in the next year, but the day it happens, it may save your life. Wearing a seat belt costs you nothing, so there&#039;s no reason not to do it for that small chance.<br /><br />Encrypting your address is easy and costs you almost nothing (ok, maybe 30 seconds out of your life), so why not encrypt your address in the small chance there&#039;s a big accident, where the SR server is compromised?<br /><br />
