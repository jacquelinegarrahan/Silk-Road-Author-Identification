				like an idiot i sent a vendor my unencrypted information.&nbsp; Im worried now because the order has been processing for a number of days.&nbsp; It has me thinking that that would be an ingenious way for LE to get people&#039;s info so they could tie all of that accounts activity to that address. Am I being overly paranoid or should I start new account?

				Don&#039;t worry too much about this just yet.<br /><br />Depending on what you bought, you&#039;re probably not a priority for LE, even in the event the vendor is compromised.<br /><br />Far and away the most likely explanation is that the vendor is lazy or unable to fill the order right now, and is taking his/her time shipping the product.<br /><br />Not really sure what opening up another account would achieve anyway, unless you plan to move house and change names as well.<br /><br />Relax&nbsp; ;D

				If the vendor is compromised, then PGP encrypting your address doesn&#039;t matter, because LE has the private key and the vendor most likely gave them the password. PGP encryption only protects your private info in the event that the SR server is compromised.

				OP, it isn&#039;t clear from your post whether you know how to encrypt but just sent it unencrypted by mistake or because you hurried, or you never learned encryption to begin with.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the second, I urge you to learn PGP encryption right away, and never send your personal onfo unencrypted, unless you just gotta have something that a vendor has who doesn&#039;t use PGP himself. Be safe. There&#039;s more than one thread in teh security section about this, including one that&#039;s stickied.<br /><br />goblin
