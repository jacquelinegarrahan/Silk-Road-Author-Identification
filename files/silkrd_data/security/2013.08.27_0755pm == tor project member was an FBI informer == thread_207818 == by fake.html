				Read this – http://pastebin.com/qWHDWCre<br />It shows a member of the TOR Project also run 12 Freedom Hosting TOR exit nodes and was a FBI Informant. This is why TOR was suddenly being pushed as “update available” 3 months back. TOR Project members were able to disable noscript and switch on JAVA without the average user noticing.<br />When Freedom Hosting was taken down, the FBI already had full co-operation from TOR Browser Bundle project team. The Tor Browser Bundle was put together with Mr Perry from Tor Project Team as he also run Freedom Hosting.<br />The man from Ireland was running a company called Host Ultra. Don’t confuse them all.
