				I cannot believe this<br /><br /><br />6.2 Potential intervention strategies<br />Given the nature of the goods sold on Silk Road, it is quite clear that various law enforcement agencies<br />may have a strong interest in trying to disrupt Silk Road operations. They appear, so far, to have been<br />unsuccessful since the site is still up and has grown in size since Sen. Schumer called on the U.S. Attorney<br />General and the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to put an end to it.<br />We discuss four possible intervention strategies that could be considered: disrupting the network, disrupting<br />the financial infrastructure, disrupting the delivery model, and laissez-faire.<br />Attacking the network. The first possible intervention policy is to disrupt the Tor network. Indeed, without<br />Tor, Silk Road cannot operate. This strategy is very likely to be difficult to put in place. First, Tor has many<br />uses beneficial to society – Silk Road and other anonymous online marketplaces are far from representing<br />the majority of Tor traffic, even though this work argues that their importance is growing. Tor is routinely<br />used by oppressed individuals to communicate without fear of reprisal. Thus, disrupting the entire Tor<br />network for the purpose of taking down Silk Road would come at a potentially high collateral cost.<br />Furthermore, Tor has shown to be resilient to a large number of attacks, due to its open design and to the<br />large amount of academic research it fosters. In particular, Tor hidden services, like Silk Road, have been<br />the subject of considerable scrutiny [27, 29]. Øverlier and Syverson showed that timing and intersection<br />attacks could be used to reveal the location of hidden services. Most of these concerns have been addressed<br />in recent versions of Tor, e.g., through the use of “entry guards.” Murdoch described how covert channels<br />(specifically, clock skew) could leak information allowing to pinpoint the location of a hidden service.<br />Attacking the financial infrastructure. Another possible disruption strategy is to attack the financial infrastructure<br />supporting Silk Road. Bitcoin has shown, in the past, to be a very volatile currency. The June 2011<br />theft of a large number of Bitcoins from the Mt.Gox exchange [4] actually caused an abrupt collapse of the<br />currency. Certain users have been complaining in forums of the uncertainty on the prices they end up paying<br />due to the instability of Bitcoin and the various commissions they have to pay to purchase Bitcoins, and then<br />to purchase items on Silk Road [6].<br />Disrupting the Bitcoin network appears, compared to attacking the Tor network, to be a more actionable<br />possibility. In fact, in the aforementioned Gawker article [10] one of the Bitcoin developers argued that<br />Bitcoin was not providing the level of security Silk Road and other anonymous marketplace operators would<br />desire. More precisely, recent research [30] has shown that Bitcoin transactions are partially vulnerable to<br />traffic analysis. Indeed, the history of all transactions is publicly available and network analysis can allow<br />to map sets of public keys to individual users and transactions.<br />Since currency exchanges like Mt.Gox where users redeem Bitcoins for cash bind public keys to actual<br />identities, Bitcoin anonymity guarantees are weaker than most Silk Road users seem to assume, even though<br />additional intermediaries (tumblers) are in place. In particular, large Silk Road sellers withdrawing massive<br />amounts of Bitcoins at once may be relatively easily identified.<br />Attacking the delivery model. Another possible angle of action is to attack the delivery model. That is,<br />to reinforce controls at the post office and/or at customs to prevent illicit items from being delivered to<br />their destination. One interesting finding from this work is the apparent lack of worries a large number of<br />sellers have: Most items are marked as shipping internationally, which means that the risk of package loss or<br />20<br />destruction is viewed as minimal by the sellers. This is certainly an area that warrants further investigation.<br />In the United States, coordination between agencies is paramount: Customs (which can inspect mail) need<br />to work in concert with Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and/or Food and Drugs Administration (FDA),<br />depending on the type of item concerned. Yet, very often, packages that are seized are simply destroyed, or<br />returned to the sender.<br />Laissez-faire. Finally, a last possible intervention strategy is actually not to intervene. Politically, this is<br />a questionable proposition, as it may sound as an admission of weakness. There are however studies that<br />show that drug abuse prevention is considerably more cost-efficient than enforcing drug prohibition [9].<br />The relatively rapidly expanding business of online anonymous markets such as Silk Road and the logistic<br />difficulties in shutting down such markets may further tilt the economic balance toward prevention and<br />cure. As a result, laissez-faire, however untenable it might currently appear from a policy standpoint, might<br />become even more attractive in light of budget constraints. Although there is no public statement about it,<br />this could be the strategy currently adopted by law enforcement, seeing that the marketplace has not met any<br />significant disruption to its operations, other than transient technical issues, in the past nine months, while<br />at the same time sales volumes have doubled.<br /><br />http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7139v1.pdf<br />
