				Does anyone have a recommendation for a good, trustworthy VPN provider that accepts Bitcoins and that I can use TOR through? I want to set this up for added security. I know my set up right now is entirely safe, but it is a bit more of a hassle then I&#039;d like (for reasons that I can&#039;t disclose for security purposes).&nbsp; Any help is appreciated!<br /><br />-moxycotton

				I have no experience with this company, but I do know that mullvad.net accepts bitcoins for VPN service.&nbsp; Here is their page that shows their fees in BTC.&nbsp; https://mullvad.net/en/bitcoin.php

				Hadn&#039;t heard of any that excepts BTC as payment but I would think your best bet would be to look into a service that is overseas as it would be harder for anyone to obtain info.

				Thanks. Yeah it seems like most people don&#039;t think a VPN will help with security really. And my setup already matches most of the security recommendations that I&#039;ve seen. I guess I&#039;ll just have to read through all the security threads and see if there is anything else I can do to improve it, or if I have any possible issues. Thanks for the help! :)

				No VPN does help allot. But whatever service you use make sure you find out what they can and cannot do regarding your info. Google for something called JonDonym.

				https://xerobank.com/<br /><br />As far as anon VPNs go, this is the one to go with. A birdie on my shoulder told me that they were originally founded by the cDc.<br /><br />You pay with regular credit card but your unique user ID is randomized and there&#039;s no way of telling what data belongs to which client. <br /><br />Do I trust them? Yes<br /><br />Do I pay for their service? Nope. 30 bux a month is too rich for my blood.<br /><br />as far as VPNs, i&#039;d say they are the best for privacy.

The XeroBank network is accessible via SSH and OpenVPN protocols. xB Browser internally manages a SSH connection to XeroBank, but will recognize and submit to OpenVPN connections.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is it possible that xerobank are working in conjunction with fedz? Yup! absolutely!&nbsp; <br /><br />Do I believe it&#039;s likely? Not at all. They were some of the original pioneers of anonymous browsing techniques, working along side tor developers. <br /><br /><br />Also; you can always pay with a pre-paid gift card/credit card. If some one were to buy me a subscription to xerobank, I&#039;d use it.
