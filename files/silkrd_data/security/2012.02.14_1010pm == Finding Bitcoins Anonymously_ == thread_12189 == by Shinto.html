				I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed, but this topic may seem trivial to those whom already have a plan that effectively works when getting bitcoins to Silk Road anonymously. So, for those of use with minor experience or none at all when it comes to buying said bitcoins, it can be a frightening concept to grasp. (With anonymity that is...)<br /><br />Obviously buying bitcoins is easy and simple for anyone to do if you choose to reveal your identity.<br />However, we (buyers &amp; sellers) don&#039;t want to do so without anonymity.<br /><br />So when it comes down to it, you want to have a sort of split personality. One for the innocent you that only websurfs and and does minor actions on a computer, spending a little money online (legitimately). Then the SR you that seems to be a complete different person that cannot be backtracked or traced.<br />The innocent you does not matter, as long as you stay clear of anything illegal.<br />The SR you needs 110% anonymity to seem like a different person. To do so we use TOR, proxies, passphrases, encryptions, e-wallets, hidden addresses, and much more.<br /><br />Some of us are new to the online game of being anonymous with money. It is completely different than just being anonymous alone. When involving legal tender of a major leading government, it can be a bit intimidating to those who have only run the streets before.<br /><br />Well, to not make this any longer I&#039;ll ask what you do. From point A to eventually point Z.<br />How do you go about being completely anonymous?<br />How do you have your comp setup?<br />What software and/or hardware do you use?<br />What services do you use and if any different than the norm, how?<br />Share your complete plan of anonymity here for all those who are new to this. Lend a helping hand and expand.<br /><br />The future is Silk Road my friends, let&#039;s treat it with care.&nbsp; ;)

				^ its all been done a billion times.. just gotta trawl the forums. (big task i know). someone put up a comprehensive guide just last week, on a paste bin etc.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ma jump in and answer some questions anways cause I lke all this.<br /><br />For me completely anonymous = TOR + encrypted OS + bitcoin washing.<br /><br />TOR is self explanatoryEncrypted.<br /><br />Encrypted OS is Windows + truecrypt (it encrypts the entire windows partition).<br /><br />Bitcoin washing there are a few good sites for this.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I actually picked up a second laptop for dirt cheap because it didn&#039;t have a working hard drive in it. I installed my preferred distro of linux on a USB thumb drive with an encrypted home directory. I use this laptop exclusively for SR and other TOR related activitiy, and usually connect from a place that offers free wifi and doesn&#039;t mind if you stay for long periods of time...like a coffee shop.<br /><br />As far as getting bitcoins anonymously, just use get-bitcoins.com and mail in cash, they are a TOR friendly business ;)

				I know a teenager who has his bank account linked directly to dwolla which he uses to fund bitcoin exchange sites.<br /><br />He makes his money on the side of his school work by bitcoin trading on these exchange sites. Watching the market, doing research, buying low, selling high, etc. He makes a lot of money. He doesn&#039;t event know what the SR is besides seeing it mentioned a few times on bitcoin forums.<br /><br />Everything he does is completely legal.<br /><br />With this being said. There is absolutely nothing illegal about buying bitcoins, or linking your bank account to a bitcoin buying site in which your identity is shown. In fact, this allows you to transfer thousands of dollars without suspicion from the bitcoin exchange you&#039;re using. <br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t get why not everyone does this. I actually know quite a bit of people who make money by simply flipping bitcoins on exchange sites; similar to flipping stocks. <br /><br />As long as your security is tight, hiding all traces to silk road and tor, then you should be full proof. Nothing is illegal about trading bitcoins online or purchasing them.<br /><br />Being associated with bitcoins and having the cops investigate you for perhaps a drug package landing at your house that was intercepted, will not get you injail. Just because you are a bitcoin trader does not mean you ordered those drugs. While they may be related, they can not convict you because of that. Just don&#039;t have drugs in your house.<br />

But imagine SR gets compromised somehow and the feds wind up with a list of transactions that have come through it. Then you&#039;ve got a block chain that goes straight back to the place where you&#039;ve happily linked your every day bank account to your bitcoins. <br /><br />Somebody on here the other day said something to the effect of &quot;don&#039;t hope for the best, assume the worst.&quot; Wise words.
