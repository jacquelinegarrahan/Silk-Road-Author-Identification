				ive figured out mt gox you have to go to trade / funding options /&nbsp; withdraw funds<br />no mention of a transfer!!#<br /><br />anyway, i put my SR wallet address and confirm........its says its withdrawing.... i just starting to feel im getting somewhere and......invalid bitcoin address.<br />it must be because mt gox doesnt like tor sites.<br />So I guess I have to do a transfer to a personal wallet on my own PC first as a stepping stone.<br />The problem is that Im using a pay as you go USB dongle that runs on the 3G mobile/cell network (registered at another address) and this wallet is going to download a 1GB of block history and my little dongle isnt going to ab able to take it!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;god damn it, what do I do now?&nbsp; <br />wait until midnight and download it while the 3G network is quiet and get a massive bill for going over my monthly 2GB limit.<br />Are there any online bitcoin wallets that make payments without trading?<br />any suggestions welcome. <br /><br />updated :&nbsp; Ive found instawallet, it works fine on tor itself, so should work with SR. <br />if anyone has info on instawallet or anything that i might be doing wrong above. im just waiting now for all 6 confirmations then its all systems go&nbsp; ::)<br />nothing is ever easy, im hoping that once all this shizzle is set up, things will be smooth.

				MTGOX should have accepted the SR address just fine. There&#039;s no way MTGOX could know where the address was from, and therefore no way they could have &#039;blocked&#039; it. So I conclude you messed up the copy/paste somehow... <br /><br />but...<br /><br />Lucky you for messing it up! In making your little mistake (whatever it may have been) you have inadvertently employed a much safer method of transferring coins into SR. Basically, the more jumps your coins make between MTGOX (your source, where you&#039;re identifiable) on their way into SR (your illegal activity), the better.<br /><br />Other things to look into to make your money&#039;s route into SR even more secure could be (1) Bitcoinfog, (2) having a Bitcoin wallet stored on an encrypted USB stick, (3) buying BTC for cash

				thanks for your interest Frank, <br />I didnt make a mistake, I tried it twice and then even changed my SR account wallet address and it still didnt work.<br />I then pasted the same copy of my changed SR wallet address into instawallet and it worked fine.<br />My bitcoins took only 20mins to transfer into my instawallet and then I sent them onto SR but they are still in the tumbler I guess 1 hour later.<br />The next part to marathon would be to place the order...&nbsp; I havent got time to figure out PGP but according to the SR wiki, SR system will encrypt and delete your message afterwards. That will have to do for me for now anyway.

				You sound like you&#039;re in a hurry. I would advise you to slow down and learn the things you think you haven&#039;t got time for. But it&#039;s up to you to decide on the level of risk you&#039;re happy with. At least do some research on vendors though.<br /><br />Good luck!
