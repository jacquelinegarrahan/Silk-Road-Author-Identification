				Hello SR family,<br /><br />How are all of you doing?? I was just browsing the net on google chrome yesterday and was shocked by one of SR forums discussion to be popped up directly on the first page of google.. And the worst part, it doesn&#039;t even required a tor browser to open the web address .. It was accessible from google chrome itself. <br /><br />Now I want to know if these discussions are there on google and no need of a tor browser, how come we all are anonymous. I want opinions, suggestions and feedback&#039;s so that our community is safe to browse our own forums, not on any other web browser and results coming up on google, but on tor browser. And what could be done to prevent these kind of issues, and last Should we really worry about all this coming up on google?? There should be a discussion...<br /><br />Thank you all and for your reference this is the web address which is directly accessible from any other browser :<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=45270.0 <br /><br />Save us Lord Jesus !!!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I always thought that if you opted to use that page to see a tor page then you would not be anonymous,you probably shouldnt click on it at all.

				Onion.to is a website that allows normal browsers to connect to the tor network. Google can access hidden services through sites like onion.to.<br />Tor hides your real ip address. Having google link to the SR forums does not compromise this.<br /><br />Using onion.to to access any hidden service will not hide your identity. You are essentially saying:<br />&quot;Hey onion.to! My IP is xxx.xx.xx.xx and I want to connect to xx hidden service&quot;.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this really brings up any &#039;issues&#039; to be concerned about, as long as users access hidden services correctly and not through 3rd parties like onion.to<br /><br />Users are far more likely to deanonymize themselves by inadvertently linking their anonymous persona with their real life identity.<br /><br />For example: you mention time periods, websites, browsers that I assume you were using from a normal browser (not tor).<br />Question: How many people accessed that link with chrome, through google - yesterday? Not too many I believe. Who knows. Maybe you are the only person who fits the above descriptors. In fact I know who knows - Google knows.<br />Also, if you are using your home computer with no proxy your ISP will also have records showing that you were accessing tor at the moment of this post.<br /><br />I have no idea of the lengths LEA&#039;s go to to deanonymize individual users. But there&#039;s no reason to make their job easier.<br /><br /><br />I assume large companies like google and ISP&#039;s&nbsp; would have no problem handing info over to LE.<br />I also assume everything that is written here is saved to an LE hard-drive.<br /><br />The old addage: &#039;Fly with the crows - get shot with the crows&#039; is turned on it&#039;s head with tor.

				Yes your isp records connections you make - Including the connection to the entry node to access tor. So your isp can see that you are connected to tor since the list of entry nodes is public (unless your using a bridge).<br />Tor does nothing to prevent this.<br /><br />Your isp will only be able to tell you have accessed the tor network. Not which sites/services you have connected to.

				^^ All right so it means I am the one who is accessing darknet through Tor and some LE&#039;s may be monitoring my traffic (May be).. For that I need a proxy or know how to use a bridge !! May be I will have to learn this technology as well and become more secure. BTW thanks for the reply and useful information .. :-)<br />

				from what i have come to understand..<br />is that Tor connections mix/match with subsequent regular connections.<br />meaning it all looks the same pretty much..<br />maybe not if you&#039;re on more one than the other...<br />or using both at the same time for a period of time..<br />or if your ISP has been asked to monitor your internet activity. :)<br /><br />not to mention, honestly, you can &quot;change&quot; your IP or MAC address..<br />without even going through Tor or any hidden service. :)<br />not to mention the Government has like 2-3 other &quot;highly classified&quot; internets.<br /><br /><br />WE ARE ALL ANONYMOUS.<br /><br />fuck the fbi and everyone else!<br />you all killed Aaron Schwartz!<br /><br />WE NEED TO WAKE UP.<br /><br />/thumbs

				That&#039;s why you get a &quot;&quot;big warning&quot;&quot; when you use .to or tor2web or the anonymox tor option.<br />Those last two have made it impossible to access silkroad.<br /><br />The warning reads too ,if you want to be anonymous you should not use their site , but tbb or tails etc instead.<br /><br />No surprises there, the warning is clear.<br />You are not anonymous !<br />So don&#039;t use the .to option.<br /><br />Only torbrowser and gpg when you give your real address to your vendor.<br />They will never catch you , if you stick to use those two.

Yes, your IP appears to be someone&#039;s real IP - it&#039;s the IP of the exit node (the last link in the relay chain). But no, they can&#039;t be prosecuted because they just show their ISP (or cops, if it ever went that far) they&#039;re running a Tor exit node. There&#039;s some info about this on the Tor site &quot;abuse FAQ&quot; and they have a standard form people can use to deal with their ISP while running an exit node.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119833.msg817723#msg817723">Quote from: rebatugam on February 12, 2013, 08:21 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is it OK to access Silk Road Forum through the onion.to-address if you don&#039;t log in?<br /><br />I did that a couple of times when I was just going to be browsing the forum without logging in.<br /><br />But I noticed the browsing was faster when I used Torbrowser so I use that every time now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s not a good idea because now your IP address can be positively linked to browsing here (and by extension, SR probably).

				Amazing and knowledgeable replies posted by everyone out here... Thank you for your help...<br /><br />Now, again I have a question... I hope you all don&#039;t mind answering this one as well... So here it goes ...<br /><br />I have configured my vidalia&nbsp; bundle to use tor, as a non exit relay i.e relay all traffic inside the tor network... So when all the traffic is inside the tor network... Is there any chance to reveal my ip address.. Also I use a program ultrasurf... So whenever Vidalia gets started... Ultrasurf is launched at the same time... <br /><br />Is there any one out there to elaborate if I am doing it rite or wrong to become anonymous??? Any help would be appreciated...<br /><br />Stay safe,<br />psytrip

				You all worry too much.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re a big fish -- as in you&#039;re DPR (the guy who started Silk Road, Dread Pirate Roberts) or you only bother measuring weights in kilos or pounds -- they don&#039;t have the resources to bother with you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even if they did... it&#039;s not illegal to use SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s just illegal to buy, possess, or sell the substances for sale on it.&nbsp; You&#039;re doing nothing illegal by using this forum or browsing the site (what you admit to here is another matter entirely, of course).<br /><br />Does this mean it&#039;s a good idea not to hide your identity or that it&#039;s pointless to be careful?&nbsp; Of course not, but it does mean if you&#039;ve screwed up here or there, it&#039;s not a big deal.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t access Silk Road or the forums here through that onion.to proxy site, encrypt your address when making orders, make sure you only order from vendors with highly rated stealth packaging, and unless you&#039;re getting pounds of weed shipped overseas there&#039;s _VERY_ little chance you&#039;ll ever get in trouble from your SR activities (if you sell in person or get caught driving while tripping or some rubbish, obviously that&#039;s different).<br /><br />BTW, these forum posts end up in Google searches because Google crawls the onion.to service.

				Prepaid smartphone bought with cash. Enable Personal Hotspot. Use Tails on Laptop. Encrypt everything sensitive. Never use phone except for connecting to Tor. Make or buy Faraday bag. Always store phone in the bag when not being used.<br /><br />Would this be a gewd setup?

				No, because you&#039;re still going to be identified by the location of the cell phone.&nbsp; If you never even turn the thing on anywhere near any property tied to you, then... yes, I suppose that would work.&nbsp; But the mobile device is the weakest link here: they&#039;re designed to prevent the end user from having administrative privileges.&nbsp; The carriers love to not let you change their precious spyware and monitoring tools.<br /><br />Rooting or jailbreaking a phone is literally exploiting a security hole in the operating system to elevate your account to administrator status, so that you can undo or override what the carriers did before they gave you the phone.&nbsp; It&#039;s hacking your own device -- maybe that puts into perspective how questionable the security of any mobile device really is.<br />
