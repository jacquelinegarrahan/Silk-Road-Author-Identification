				So i&#039;ve been doing bitinstant to mtgox via cash deposit to BoA. This sucks for me because i have trouble making it to the bank before it closes. Now i see that with bitinstant to coinapult you can use 7-11, cvs, ect. My question is how does that work, are there extra fees and what not. Im used to the out of state deposit slip and i think i read somewhere that cvs is moneygram or some shit like that. I just want to not have to wait 3 months between orders. sorry for bad spelling and grammer, really hungover and dont care<br /><br />P.S. The fuck happened to all the domestic Coke. TV, GOA please come back

				Yes all those other options like Walmart, CVS, etc are MoneyGram. After setting up your order at BitInstant, you go and fill out a send money form using a fake name if you want, and include the business name/account number(s) you will get during the order process, deposit whatever the amount is (stay under $900 to avoid them wanting ID), wait while they enter all the info, and you&#039;re done. Coinapult will email whatever email you provided to BitInstant within a matter of minutes, with a link in it that will take you to a page where you can send your coins to any other BTC address. Remember to write down your 4-digit PIN too.

				I tried to do this the other day at CVS.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a red phone you have to use..&nbsp; After meandering about with their automated attendant I finally got a real person.&nbsp; After giving them all the info they said I was good and I just needed to pay the cashier. So I went to the cashier and he found my transaction but there was a problem with the company I was trying to send money to.&nbsp; The company came up as ZipZap and after the manager got on the phone with the moneygram people and I waited about 30 minutes, they said there was a problem with ZipZap&#039;s account and I would be unable to send them any funds.<br /><br />The whole process was a pain in the ass and I got no coins out of it.&nbsp; Has anyone else had the same experience?&nbsp; I tried twice and got the same results twice.

				The CVS/711/Wal-mart methods seem to be a hit or miss. Worth a shot at least though, the worst that&#039;s going to happen is you waste a few minutes of your time.
