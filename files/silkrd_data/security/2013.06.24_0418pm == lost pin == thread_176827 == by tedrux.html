				a phishing site, for example, there will be NO WAY to recover your account. All money deposited to your account and reputation associated with it will be lost!!! <br /><br />hey, is that true? if thats true then you gotta stop it. I cant lose that money . that isn&#039;t even my money man, i was able to gather it through the kindness and generousity of the spare change thread and if its going to be just gone your going to make me cry. I can tell you my pin if i get a few more tries. I think I know it with one more try. i know I was warned but this is an honest case of simple forgetting. please give me some way to straiten it out- i can prove that I am ME and not a scammer. .this was my first order dude, please have a heart. :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;(

				What you need to do is reset your pin. You do this by entering it in again and once you enter it 5 times wrong theres a counter for 72 hours until you can reset it. Once the timer is done the link will be on the home page to reset. You won&#039;t lose your bitcoins. This happened to me on my first transaction too and I freaked. Had a lot of money in my account. :)

Change password immediately.<br />2. Reset pin... you won&#039;t be able to utilize your account for a period of time... I thought was a week, but it might be less. (maybe that&#039;s just resetting your pin)<br />3. Don&#039;t give anyone your pin. Ever. Unless you are done with the acct.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, what was your first order?

				Yea!&nbsp; I am not the only dumbass who did this.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br />I just went through this recently.<br /><br />Your pin will reset in 72 hours and at that time, you will be given an opportunity to reset it to whatever you want.&nbsp; The main page of SR will have a countdown until you can reset so it should be a obvious process to you, once you login.

				Dude, do not expect people to make a transaction for you. You need to read the security section of the forums a bit. You are not being safe if that is what you go ahead and do. Like maybe some gang member or something sees that. Makes a purchase for you and figures out your address and name. Bam you are getting raided tied up and who knows from there. Wait it out. Plus, no one knows if you are a scammer or not.

				Good to hear you made it through the 72 hours!<br /><br />Regarding ordering for others: it is possible to do this securely... after all, the PGP address would secure your identity from the third party placing the order...<br /><br />Anyway, take care.

				I think I&#039;m doing PGP right, if I&#039;m not then I don&#039;t know it but I encrypt and send and it decodes on the other end when some one has my public key. it seems pretty simple really, like clicking &#039;okay&#039; through all the options simple.
