Is it the pop-up to update Java? Does the Tor home page load? I am having no such issues. Have you tried removing the new install of Tor, downloading it again, re-booting your system and then re-installing Tor again? You shouldn&#039;t use a version of Tor where a security flaw has been patched.

				What website were you on?<br /><br />Java script is turned on by default in the Tor browser. (They did this, because they feared that if they turned them off by default, many users would make exceptions for the ones they need, and in that way developing a unique fingerprint of allowed/disallowed scripts, compromising their anonymity.)<br /><br />Anyway, if you configure no script to block all scripts (like I do), and you change to the new update browser bundle, your settings are reset (scripts will be allowed again). You can turn them off by clicking the &quot;s&quot; to the left of the address bar.

				Mate, start from scratch and don&#039;t try to overwrite the previous version. Completely remove Tor from your system. Download a fresh copy and install Tor as per usual. There is no reason at all Tor shouldn&#039;t work if your starting fresh unless you have some underlying problems with your system. Could be your registry, some malware/spyware or even a trojan or a virus could be causing you problems.

If you installed a package, then hopefully your package has a way to uninstall itself. The Windows packages include uninstallers. The proper way to completely remove Tor, Vidalia, Torbutton for Firefox, and Polipo on any version of Windows is as follows: <br /><br />a.In your taskbar, right click on Vidalia (the green onion or the black head) and choose exit.<br /><br />b.Right click on the taskbar to bring up TaskManager. Look for tor.exe in the Process List. If it&#039;s running, right click and choose End Process.<br /><br />c.Click the Start button, go to Programs, go to Vidalia, choose Uninstall. This will remove the Vidalia bundle, which includes Tor and Polipo.<br /><br />d.Start Firefox. Go to the Tools menu, choose Add-ons. Select Torbutton. Click the Uninstall button.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you do not follow these steps (for example by trying to uninstall Vidalia, Tor, and Polipo while they are still running), you will need to reboot and manually remove the directory &quot;Program Files\Vidalia Bundle&quot;.<br />&nbsp;
