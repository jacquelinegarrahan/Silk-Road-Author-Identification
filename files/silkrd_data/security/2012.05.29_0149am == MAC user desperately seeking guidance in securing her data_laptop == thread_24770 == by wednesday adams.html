				Hi,<br /><br />PLEASE HELP, I&#039;m not a IT person, but I&#039;m moderately savvy w/computers........and I can learn quick when motivated! : )<br />I&#039;ve been reading through these posts and I still am not sure exactly what I need to do to make my laptop totally safe.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got OS X (10.6.eight), I downloaded/installed the tor bundle, I loaded it onto the desktop but have since copied it onto a usb drive--..... I also downloaded/installed &quot; portable pgp&quot; ...........I&#039;ve come a long way in 2 days, got pub/priv keys made, learned to crypt messages,&nbsp; .............now, I need to learn how to make my computer as safe as possible.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen different things on here from put everything on a usb port, use liberte (?) on a usb key and/or to create a partitioned HD, I&#039;ve downloaded truecrypt but don&#039;t know how it works.......So, my question is:&nbsp; what should I do to protect my computer in the event LE comes along and takes it (unlikely, perhaps, but why not be as safe as possible, right?).&nbsp; <br />--How do I securely delete files from my laptop (I&#039;ve got a file sitting on desktop w/passwords/software that I don&#039;t want anyone to see)<br />--How do I make it so that I can still use my tor browser, go on to SR, etc but that no one who got a hold of my computer would find anything incriminating on it?<br />--Should I keep my public key copied onto my usb, or is that dumb?<br /><br />Pls any help is greatly, greatly appreciated, I recognize the importance of crypting mssgs and cleaning up after yourself on your computer but I just don&#039;t know where to even begin<br /><br />Thanks, SO SO glad to have found the SR community!!

				Sorry I can&#039;t be more MAC specific as I don&#039;t own one.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how your budget is, but I would recommend getting a cheap laptop at a pawn shop or off ebay. Personally I have a dedicated laptop on which I have installed an Ubuntu variant that encrypts the entire disk. Everything on the laptop is secure as long as you use a good password.<br /><br />Truecrypt is a transparent on-the-fly encryption program. You use it to create an encrypted &quot;container (file)&quot; (recommended for beginners) or an encrypted partition. Once you create your container you use Truecrypt to open it. No one can see what&#039;s inside the container without your password.<br /><br />Your public key is just that - public. You really want to protect the private key. I have no idea where a MAC would store this and it probably depends on the program used to create it. You could find the location of the private key in the programs documentation.<br /><br />Passwords are ALWAYS the weak point when it comes to encryption. Use a phrase and translate it to leet-speak for easy memory. Add some symbols in there. You should avoid repeating letters/symbols back to back. Don&#039;t write it down - ever.<br /><br />An example:<br /><br />!Th15.i5.4n.3x4mpl30fAg00dp455w0rd?<br />&nbsp;

				Hi Wednesday, hope you are well. <br /><br />I just bought a Maccy Pro so I am just getting my head round it. I installed TrueCrypt but I can&#039;t work out how to encrypt the entire drive yet.&nbsp; :-\ Done the hidden container though. :)

				I say this a lot lol....<br /><br />Download Parallels (virtual machine software for Mac). <br />Download Windows XP/Ubuntu <br />Install Windows XP/Ubuntu virtual machine on Parallels.<br />Add XP/Ubuntu VM to truecrypt hidden container (on Mac). &lt;&lt; This step is not so much necessary but useful for hiding the VM)<br />Download all necessary programs for XP/Ubuntu (truecrypt, tor, PGP etc...)<br /><br />If you&#039;re a buyer then all of this is not so much required but it is advisable.

				hello<br /><br />for securing a macbook i suggest using a bootable live operating system.<br />There are operating systems preconfigured for TOR that are really easy to use and come with handy tools like pgp pre-installed. On shut down the system wipes your ram and leaves no trace of activity.<br /><br />The Amnesic Incognito Live System - Tails, is one of those systems that runs fine on a Macbook.<br /><br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Download the current version @ https://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burn the ISO image onto a DVD<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert blank DVD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open &quot;Disk Utility&quot; (OSX feature)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the &quot;File&quot; Menu click on &quot;Open Disk Image...&quot; and choose the Tails ISO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ISO will now appear in the lower part of the left column<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select the image there and click on the atomic &quot;Burn&quot; icon in the top left corner and burn to the DVD with slow speed (2x/4x)<br /><br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you restart your Macbook with the DVD inserted wait for the screen to get white and immediately press and hold the alt button until you reach the bootloader. Navigate to the DVD entry labeled &quot;Windows&quot; and press enter.<br /><br /><br />Voilá! You are now ready to go. Network drivers, Touchpad, etc. all supported by default.<br /><br />You also have the option to insert a Thumbdrive and clone the system to it via&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applications - System Tools - Tails USB Installer<br />This will give you the option to create a persistent Volume (e.g. save files, pgp keys) and will work much faster than a DVD.<br />Although booting from a USB drive is not possible with the default apple bootloader you can download and install rEFIt from you OSX, which will recognize the drive.<br />rEFIt: http://refit.sourceforge.net/<br /><br /><br />hope that helped :)

(Tails USB Installer)<br /><br />if you plan on becoming a seller you might want to clean up nicely.. on the mac settings you can somehow set the method for secure emptying the trash to overwrite multiple times (1/3/5/7) .. but just for deleting the tor browser bundle file you should really not bother to do so. after all thats really not sensitive information and you wont get in trouble... if you have any silk road related files/logs you can however do that. :)<br /><br />peace

				thank you everyone who replied to my post, I&#039;m proud to say I managed to put tails on a usb cd and to &quot;clone ?&quot; the drive, so i now have tails up and running on my usb stick, I also used somthing off other forums Plop bootloader--I think, to get my mac to boot up onto tails.............needless to say, I am very proud of my techno-challanged self!!&nbsp; Thanks

				just a thanks to wednesday and omnium for bringing me this info, v helpful. One question - probably stupid - Omnium, do you have to download rEFit when using tails with the dvd already in, or can you download to your hd first?
