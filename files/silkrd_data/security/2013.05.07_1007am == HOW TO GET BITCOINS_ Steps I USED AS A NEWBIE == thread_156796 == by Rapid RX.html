				Hey all!<br /><br />I posted this in the newbie section but maybe it makes more sense here. Took me a while to write, so might as well share. I did this as a newbie. The good thing was I got BTC and learned a lot.<br /><br />I did take an Ambien, so feel free to point out mistakes. This is a round about method, but it works, and isn&#039;t too pricey.<br /><br />Cut.... and.... PAST:<br /><br />Hey All!<br /><br />Someone emailed me and asked. I emailed back this. I bet there are typos as I popped an Ambien before. Please correct stuff. <br /><br />This is not necessarily the best way. It is simply a way. I tried to make it easy. Like easy to the point that that dumb girl from high school could follow.<br />=========================<br /><br />FROM MY EMAIL (copy + paste):<br /><br />To start, anytime you create an account, write it down or copy it in a file or do something. Losing these things is a bitch.<br /><br />STEP ONE: TOR AND SILK ROAD ACCOUNT<br />1. Do you have a Tor browser? Internet Explorer or Safari or anything else will not work. So, travel to:<br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en<br /><br />2. Once you download it, you have to install it (like anything else). Then open it. You are now connected to the Tor network. It looks like any browser but allows you to surf the web anonymously. Now you can access Silk Road.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ <br /><br />This is SilkRoad. Sign up. Write down everything so you don&#039;t forget.<br /><br />STEP TWO: WTF?!? BITWHO?<br />To buy things on it you must use Bitcoins. There are countless ways of obtaining them. All of them, well, are pretty awful. Here&#039;s one way (and how I started)&nbsp; to do it:<br /><br />1. Go to www.mtgox.com and open an account.<br /><br />2. By looking around or a minute or so you will find a Buy &amp; Sell then &quot;Add Funds.&quot; Keep this open. <br /><br />3. So you direct your browser to https://www.bitinstant.com/. ASIDE: Most people use bitinstant&nbsp; (it can be a scary progress because you can go hours before your funds appear and can&#039;t help but to wonder, &quot;are they gone forever?&quot; ... they&#039;re not... usually. Never to me)<br /><br />4. Here you can see the option cash to Mt. Gox. That&#039;s what you want. By browsing SilkRoad for a bit, you should have an idea of how many BTC (bitcoins) you&#039;ll need. Let&#039;s say $200.<br /><br />5. To fill out the BI (BitInstant) form you&#039;ll need your Mt. Gox account number. (It&#039;s a good idea to keep both pages open simultaneously). At the top of the Mt. Gox page you&#039;ll see your account number. <br /><br />6. Fill out the rest of the BI form, play the game to ensure you are not a computer. Then it will give you a form to print.<br /><br />7. Take the form to a BitInstant store like 7~11 (or whatever you signed up for). There are many. You go to the store, hand them the form, they&#039;ll know what to do. You pay them your $200.<br /><br />8. Now, when you go back, unless something changed you should see $200 minus some fees in your Mt. Gox account (if you want $200, might want to do $215.00 Everyone has fees). <br /><br />9. Once your funds appear in Mt. Gox, you convert your money to BTC. You go to Trade&gt;Buy BTC&gt;And type in however much money you have. Within a few minutes (depending on how Mt. Gox is running)&nbsp; you&#039;ll have some BTC.<br /><br />10. Now the tricky part. It is of my belief that if you are a buyer, you can transfer them straight into SR. But. if you want to be super safe, you can transfer them first to a coin washing site like BitcoinFog: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/?page=deposit. It&#039;s like virtually laundering money. I think...<br />THE STEPS<br />a) In SR, go to your Account page and copy your address into a file (the address to accept BTC). Label it.<br />b) After you sign up for BitcoinFog, Get your address for there. Label it.<br />c) in Mt. Gox, go to funding options&gt;withdraw funds. Enter in the amount and your BITCOINFOG address. <br />d) That amount will in some time (who knows) appear in Bitcoinfog. <br /><br />10. Now, in BitcoinFog, your coins are washed for a 1~2% fee. You want to transfer them to the SILKROAD Address you took down in 9a.<br />a) Enter the SR address in the box.<br />b) I usually extract is the quickest way possibly (you&#039;ll see the options).<br /><br />The reason for BitcoinFog is, that for some bizarre reason you are questioned, all you did was transfer your BTC into a &quot;wallet&quot; you thought was good. Play dumb. And the coins can&#039;t be traced to SR.<br /><br />11. Now, in some time, you will have bitcoins in SR!<br /><br />It looks cumbersome, and it is. You&#039;ll find faster ways. This is actually kind of easy. It get pricey, though.<br />================<br /><br />If anyone sees anything that&#039;s wrong, comment! Fix!<br /><br />I super hope this is clear and helps someone. I&#039;m a computer guy and this place was a bit overwhelming at first. Sometimes it still is!<br /><br />Oh and if you&#039;re new, might as well check out what I have (not much right now) but often cheap oxycodone! Any pot!
