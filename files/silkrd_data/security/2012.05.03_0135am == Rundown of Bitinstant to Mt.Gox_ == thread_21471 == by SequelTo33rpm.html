				So I am tired of waiting for Dwolla taking 3-5 days to give me my money so I can put it into Mt Gox. By the time I get the money, the deals or items I&#039;ve wanted to buy are gone ( boo hoo poor fucking me) I&#039;ve read that Bitinstant is a great way to go as it gives you your money within an hour. I&#039;m just curious if someone can give me a step by step quick tutorial to doing that. I&#039;d hate to deposit 300+ dollars and not have it show up. Thanks guys and gals.

				MtGox &gt; Add Funds &gt; Bitinstant &gt; Scroll down and copy Exchange Account #<br /><br />Then go to: <br /><br />Bitinstant &gt; Pay From: &quot;Cash Deposit&quot; &gt; Pay To: &quot;MtGox&quot; &gt; Enter Destination (Exchange Account) &gt; Enter Amount &gt; Enter Email<br /><br />When you hit &#039;send funds&#039; you must choose a bank location. It will then create an &#039;invoice&#039;. Print it out and take it to the bank. Fill out the deposit slip with the name (trustcash or some shit..), account number and deposit amount.&nbsp; You must deposit the exact amount on the invoice. For example, if you want to deposit $300, then bitinstant will make you deposit $301.23 or something like that. <br /><br />I just did this from memory so there may be something I left out. But you get the idea. On a recent deposit my Mtgox account was credited in 10 minutes. It&#039;s never taken longer than 20 minutes. Good luck and happy trails on SR. Hope this helps.

				Hawk,<br /><br />Thanks a ton. Does it matter if you use your account name or does it have to be your 6 digit Mt.Gox account number?

				Is there a number one has to call after making the deposit. And would it be frowned up to just have the teller fill out the information?

				After making the deposit you&#039;re done. The invoice will have an email addy for customer support if your Mtgox account isn&#039;t credited in a timely fashion, or you encounter a problem.&nbsp; IIRC someone posted that they had a speedy response from customer support. Bitinstant will also send you a confirmation email, I believe. <br /><br />In terms of filling out the form.... IDK, you gotta feel that out for yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;d say just fill it out, since that&#039;s the accepted protocol and you don&#039;t want to be &quot;that guy&quot; and bring attention to yourself. But, hey, I&#039;m new to this as well and there&#039;s no hard &#039;n fast rules - we&#039;re making it all up as we go!

				If you enter $300 then you will be charged $301.23 or something, but only like $285.50 will be deposited into your account. If you must you can go through their policies, and MTgox policies and figure out exactly how much they will be taking out for their services. I always just figure out how much I need for my purchase and add $50 on top of that to make sure all the fees are covered. Then you just have a few extra coins laying around in the end no big deal.
