				Hello all from this cool forum. I&#039;m new to all of this and tried reading and research on how this works, but I&#039;m still confused. Im from Canada and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction where&nbsp; i can get myself some bitcoins. I tried www.bitinstant.com cuz i read its a pretty good place to get them. But they don&#039;t have a Canada selection in the countries given. Basically I&#039;d like to get bitcoins today and purchase something today if its possible. I know i&#039;ve read somewhere it takes a bit of time to get your coins, but i&#039;m impatient. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Oh also i have no clue to what sites are a scam and which sites are legit in purchasing bitcoins. I see that mygix all over the forum but also read its a scam.

				Do you got a link bud? I tried searching for it with no results. And is it Canada friendly? Cuz bitinstant doesnt have a Canadian option. I can do a bank transfer right thru my computer now.

				New here as well and it took me a few days to get some bitcoins set up.&nbsp; I would have to assume a bank transfer or wire would have to work with several of the bitcoin exchanges.&nbsp; They would be quick but not totally anonymous.

				I normally tell people to go search the forums for the information they need (you&#039;ll find any info you&#039;re looking for by doing that!) but canadianbitcoins.com should be able to sort you out.

				I don&#039;t know if they sell Money Pack&#039;s up there in Canada, but I just posted a way to get bitcoins this weekend cheaply and quickly from Coinbox.<br /><br />Buy a Money Pack, contact Coinbox, and for $15 or so, he&#039;ll exchange them into bitcoins...easy.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/d015aa21af

				lol that made me laugh, silly Americans<br /><br />cavirtex.com will allow you to buy BTC by going into any RBC, Scotia, or BMO and making a business deposit into their (cavirtex&#039;s) account.&nbsp; There are other options but this is one of them.
