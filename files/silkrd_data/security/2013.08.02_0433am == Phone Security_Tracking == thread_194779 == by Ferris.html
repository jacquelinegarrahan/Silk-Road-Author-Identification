				I have two phones, one of which is a throwaway. I obviously do not want these phones to be connected. I&#039;m curious to know more about tracking of my personal phone. What is my risk here? Can I put it in &quot;airplane&quot; mode when I am working? Can I use my throwaway at/near home? Should I get a smartphone throwaway encrypt texts/calls?<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if these details are significant or if I should be focusing my attention on other things.<br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations for throwaway brands?

				Never, ever never ever never switch the SIM card between the phones<br />Basic phone with no internet is best<br />Do not keep both phone switch on at the same time/place<br />Do not call between the phone<br />Do not call the same people between the phones. Pick who you call from which phone and do not switch<br />Change SIM or phone number does not provide any benefit. Throw it away get a new SIM card and phone.

				A &quot;dumb&quot; phone can also be pinged to track your location. If you need total privacy, leave phone at home/ safe location and keep shielded if possible.

				I used to connect the battery to the phon e is such a way I could remove the cimchip without disconnecting the power. Now the phone has no sim, but thinks there is one. Now you can put the simchip in an other phone.<br />&nbsp;L.E. Sees now two phones with the same number but different emei. You can send calls trough. A call to phone 1 can be forwarded to an other phone and that phone can do the same again. If the last phonenumber is in several phones L.E, Has a problem.<br />Triangulation is useless, or they have at least several locations where you might have been.<br />Triangulation is no evidence anymore<br />It works only with old phones. If you can remove the simchip without disconnecting the powersupply, there is no possibility to use the same chip in different phones at the same time.<br />Keep the conversations short.<br /><br />In the Netherlands there was a criminal, who was hard to get because he linked through one phone to an other and that phone again to an other and so on.<br /><br />Only old phones have this option.<br />A invention of a friend of mine who wanted to know the reason why you have to remove the battery before you can remove the sim-chip.<br /><br />We wondered what would happen if we made it impossible to disconnect the battery from the phone (still connected with wires) and then remove the sim-chip.<br />It appeared the phone still worked even without a chip.<br />A other phone contained the same chip too, making it difficult for L.E. where I am/was<br /><br />The phone without the chip had the option to take a call automatically, so without pushing buttons.<br />&nbsp;Because you&#039;re phone is taking the call L.E. Thinks you are at the point where the phone made it&#039;s connection. In the Netherlands the option to link a telephone to an other telephone is done by *21<br /><br />Except your simnumber your emei is also tracked, but you can play with them and make it L.E. very difficult to locate you.<br /><br />There are devices for sale that can take any phonenumber you want and shows even the emeinr that you want others to see. You can even tab in on conversations, or make a connection to the microphone without the owner even know it. Even blackberry can be tapped and the new encryption is cracked too. So no need to have a server in the country of your suspect. No need from the telephone company or police.<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the feedback. I am just trying to take all the necessary precautions.<br /><br />How often do you recommend changing phones? Once every month or two? I would be small-time in a big city.<br /><br />If I use call forwarding, should I change out both phones or is the relay phone ok to leave in a safe place and just change the forwarding number/phone?<br /><br />Last thing...for shielding, does anyone have any suggestions for a small box/container?

				Once a month should be good. The more often the better. As far as shielding google faraday bags. They will block all RF signals and the phone cant be tracked while inside the bag. I would keep it in the bag within 10 miles of your house. And while your drop phone is active I would keep your personal phone in the bag so both will never be tracked to the same location. Actually I would keep your drop phone in the bag unless your actively making a call on it. And the call forwarding trick. Don&#039;t do it. The signal interception equipment that exists today is next to impossible to fool, you&#039;d be surprised. In my last job we used to find some pretty bad dudes by tracking their cell phones. They tried all kinds of tricks thinking they were slick. Never worked. And never think you are not on the radar because your a little guy in a big pond, that is the beginnings of complacency and corner cutting. Always assume they are on your ass. Don&#039;t be predictable, don&#039;t set patterns.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Read recent USA spy revelations there is discussion of how throw away phone is tracked and it is how I say when one phone &quot;drop off&quot; the network (user throw it away) and then new phone join the network and begin to call same number.

				In that case. After you ditch one buy 2 more. Set up the second to forward to your target phone.

				If you use a throwaway phone always talk on it using code, but not in code. What that means is you never directly talk about weight, money or anything. You should have some sort of code set up between you and your supplier. &quot;Hey want to meet for beers? How does 4:30 sound?&quot; Codeword Beers means you want to meet in 1hr to exchange drugs and are buying 4.3 pounds or something, or $4,300 worth. <br /><br />Because in court cases they play back all your phone calls to prove you are trafficking. <br /><br />Talking in code, would be &quot;Red Squirrel to Dragon&#039;s Teeth, 1650 acknowledge&quot; which would then be played back in court to prove you&#039;re obfuscating your actions and doing something illegal. Trying to talk your way out of it makes you look like a liar and jury won&#039;t believe anything you say after that. The stupidest, tinniest details really matter in court. Just go over the weev trial docs when he was sentenced for the heinous crime of looking at a public URL. The prosecutor twisted everything he said on IRC and emails into a conviction. <br /><br />Also assume you are always being tracked with the phone and don&#039;t trust airplane mode, there is police malware that makes you believe the phone is off or airplane mode is active when it&#039;s still recording the room with the&nbsp; mic owned and giving away your position. Look up FinSpy/FinFisher spyware. <br /><br />I build custom Android source phones and sell them here locally. Even though I&#039;ve done serious work in ripping out all remote attack avenues, installing mandatory access controls that block updates, dropping in deniable 256 AES encryption and sabotaged everything that can be used for forensics like the recovery rom I still wouldn&#039;t trust the phone 100% and tell people to be aware it&#039;s still a portable spying machine, just off the shelf police malware won&#039;t work on it.

Network sends forwarding number to forwarded phone. Old phones would show &quot;forwarded call&quot; on screen. I know Apple phone does not show this anymore on the screen but the network still knows.
