				I had two very small packages from the netherlands not arrive, its been a month now so im pretty sure there not coming. No customs letter or calls from the police and i had several small domestic packs arrive during that time. My question is, is it safe to order domestically from a reliable vendor to the same address? Does customs flag addresses for usps?

				Well, I would give it another week or two to be sure.. I am pretty sure that were they to find anything that they would flag your address with usps, but packages can often take over a month from europe. <br />Maybe you should order up one of those dummy packages for kicks...

Do you know if its policy to always send a customs letter? Im not even sure if usps ever handled either package. Do flagged addresses get watched for purchasing of bitcoins?
