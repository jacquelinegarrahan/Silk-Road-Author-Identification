			<dd class="postbody">
				Yesterday I received a letter from US Customs &amp; Border Control, telling me that in January they intercepted a small amount of drugs addressed to me.<br /><br />Things that are bizarre about the letter:<br />1) The drug they claimed to have intercepted is one that I have never ordered, and I don&#039;t believe any vendors I&#039;ve used even sell this drug.<br />2) I have received every order that I&#039;ve ever made on SilkRoad. (none have been intercepted)<br />3) Although I have made two orders in February, as of January I had not made any previous orders since last October. But the letter claims they intercepted the envelope in late January.<br /><br />I really have no idea what to make of this letter. Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences to share? The only thing I know for sure is that I&#039;m going to take a break from ordering on here until I figure this out a little more...

				someone else had the same thing happen to them maybe you should compare vendors that you ordered from and see if there is some fuckwad sending poorly packed stuff to his customers trying to get them in shit?

				I&#039;m really puzzled. Why the fuck would one of the few vendors I&#039;ve ordered from (all highly reputable and respected sellers on SR) waste ~$100 worth of drugs trying to get me in trouble? It just doesn&#039;t make any sense.

				Yeah I&#039;m really trying to get to the bottom of this too.&nbsp; This happened to two people on here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to tweak you but your address may be flagged at some point in time, maybe from the vendor side or some sort......&nbsp; this kind of shit doesn&#039;t just happen out of the blue, on the same site.&nbsp; Be paranoid.&nbsp; Get a new drop.<br /><br />You have to be really fucking cautious at this point.&nbsp; I would not want to be on any kind of &#039;list&#039; they operate.

				Well you do know for a fact that none of the drugs you ordered got intercepted? Then don&#039;t worry about anything.....<br /><br />My guess is it&#039;s probably some asshole vendor who you ordered from before, got bored and decided to forge a fake letter and freak you out. <br /><br />It probably means nothing except some dick trying to get a laugh... just be glad they didn&#039;t come knocking on your door. Remember, vendors can provide excellent service, while still secretly doing assholish things. Don&#039;t be fooled by apperances.

				I have an alternate explanation:<br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone is trying to frame or set you up. I truly believe that Customs and DEA are collecting vendors mail streams, then harvesting the &quot;to:addresses&quot;, and then, without opening any packages whatsoever, they just send a letter to the addressees. <br /><br />So they have a prospective overseas vendor, they have grabbed a few packs and verified, confiscated, sent the letter (they opened one of mine and took the shit, and inserted the famous letter, and resealed with&nbsp; green tape. Once their investigation gets some legs under it, they start pushing towards the shipper, not the receivers,&nbsp; because that&#039;s where the money is, and they can&#039;t do much with the myriad small quantity buyers. Keep that in mind: They are pushing their investigations towards the shipper. <br /><br />Then once the shipper is ID&#039;d (even with fake return addresses, they can make educated guesses, identify the source city and postal route, etc.) they start harvesting the recipient&#039;s addresses, but dont actually pull the packs, because there is millions of pieces of mail and its not feasible. <br /><br />So they mark a shipper, look for the recipient&#039;s address via the sorting machine OCR output, and send a letter - since they didn&#039;t open anything and confiscated nada, they had to guess what it was, especially if the vendor sells multiple items. Or, they are not sure what the vendor is selling at all, they just know that certain mail from the originating neighborhood is potentially dirty. <br /><br />The letter, its erroneous conclusion, and lack of evidence means you walk away for now. you might want to get another business mailbox, another drop, and get off the radar with no overseas orders for awhile.....and look around your home and make sure that there is no contraband in plain sight. They will probably take no further action as they didn&#039;t in my case. Don&#039;t call them, don&#039;t write them, even if says so. <br /><br />That is the best guess from here, they are pushing outward to the shipper. They are sending letters to the buyers without even inspection. The shippers should be securely warned, they are in higher jeopardy.

				I think Cgault is on the money here. They might have monitored and analyzed a mail stream and now they are on a fishing expedition. Just probing the waters. I wouldn&#039;t order anything to that address for a while.

				Something, somewhere, somehow went wrong. Consider that letter a burn notice and scrub everything. Don&#039;t use that address or username again, and start over. Very likely, you are going to be OK, very likely the letter is either a scam, a fishing expedition or fallout from some vendor getting sloppy, but it&#039;s worth the effort to get a fresh start just in case.

				Yes.. the DEA is known to photograph the addresses on suspected drug mailouts from vendors they are trying to profile at customs and will send you their own letter as either a threat, or bait to get you to come claim something or to send money or whatever. It has happened to many marijuana seeds vendors.<br /><br />Whoever you ordered from, tell them to change their labels, change their envelope designs/whatever, change their return addresses because they&#039;re getting profiled.<br /><br />**EDIT<br /><br />Don&#039;t ever use your address again, it&#039;s marked for life as a suspected drug importing address. <br />
