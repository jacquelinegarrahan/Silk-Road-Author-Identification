				Hey Guys, <br />There is a new vendor here, but he has 0 feedback bc he is so new.. He made me a custom order and I can be in escrow, my question is are custom orders safe and still be protected by the SR if I am in escrow? Should I be scared to order from a brand new vendor? It is quite a large order, an tips are helpful. I am keeping his name secret too not hurt his rep in any way.

				custom orders are protected under Escrow.<br /><br />HOWEVER, Be careful with stealth orders, because you can not leave public Feedback on them. (an issue i believe should be changed)<br />

				you can leave feedback, it will effect his (99) score.. but it wont show up under his name.<br /><br />If you are worried about that, just tell him to not make it stealth, he can still make custom orders that are not steatlh and therefore will show up under his name.

				Odds are it will be perfectly fine but it never hurts to be cautious. Any reason why you wouldnt want to make a small order first. I&#039;d be very wary about making a large order with a new vendor because quality, speed, packaging etc are all unknowns and I&#039;d hate to have a large amount of money tied up with so many unknowns.

				agreed. i only ever make $100 purchases max with new vendors. just to test them out.<br /><br />I would say close to 50% of new vendors are either scammers/low quality/dimwits who cant get anything right and dont last.<br /><br />40% make it and are ok.<br />10% are excellent vendors.
