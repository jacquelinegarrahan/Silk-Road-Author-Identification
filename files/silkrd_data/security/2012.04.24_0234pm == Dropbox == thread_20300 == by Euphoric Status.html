				Title: <strong>Dropbox</strong><br />

				I use Dropbox for all of my info... my eBooks, all of my deep web shit, my notes (for deep web and various things)... all that good stuff. Dropbox isn&#039;t the safest thing to use, but how much am I putting myself at risk for using it? I&#039;m using Tor to connect to stay anonymous but will Dropbox give myself away?<br /><br />Honestly I wouldn&#039;t mind just using a USB device for now, but my biggest concern is that I use 1Password as a password manager with over 400 entries. I mainly use my laptop, but I use my iPhone A LOT too to login to certain websites. Maybe I can just use Dropbox for my passwords? But still wouldn&#039;t that increase the risk if I have Dropbox constantly open while doing all of my deep web stuff?<br /><br />Ugh. I&#039;m probably over thinking it. Someone calm me down lol.

				Simple answer is to encrypt everything that you are concerned about with Truecrypt, that way if LE do get hold of your Dropbox account you are not in any trouble. Split it up into 750 MB encrypted containers and name them as .iso files of Linux distros or something. Don&#039;t use an iPhone for anything dodgy, they are backdoored to fuck and I cannot imagine a company like Apple making a stand against a court order.

				Hm... but wouldn&#039;t that be useless? Can&#039;t they just log onto my Dropbox account and download the files, therefore keeping it on an encrypted device would be useless? Or do I encrypt all of the info connected to Dropbox, then sync the files to my account? If I do that, what would happen if someone downloaded the encrypted files from another computer?

				Actually, would it be safe to use Dropbox just for 1Password and keep all underground scene stuff on a bootable USB with Liberte?

				Don&#039;t mean to rain on the above posters parade here BUT there is a real way to secure iPhones, HTCs, BlackBerrys etc etc. You just have to know where to go. You are right that without the right extras it is way way too hot however with the right software you can use them all day long. I/the people I work with all have ours done and we are fine to use them now and yes, we had them professionally checked.

				Okay, thanks Guru and everyone else.<br /><br />So... one bootable USB for Liberte or Tails, and another encrypted USB to store my valuable info? Does this sound ok?

				One second... what&#039;s the difference between using a password generator that creates 256-bit passphrases compared to making one manually with Diceware?

				Has anyone here heard of Spideroak? It&#039;s a client-side encrypted cloud storage service. It&#039;s rather similar to Dropbox, but encrypted and more cost effective.<br /><br />https://spideroak.com/<br /><br />-sSh-
