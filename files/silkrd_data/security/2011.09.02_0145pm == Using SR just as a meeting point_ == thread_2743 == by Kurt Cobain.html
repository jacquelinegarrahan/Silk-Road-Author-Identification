				Hi,<br />is there any reason, why one shouldn`t buy from an honest SR-vendor, without using the usual way of payment via SR. I mean, if SR might go down one day and LE is able to crack and use all the transaction-data, somebody might be in trouble. Why not communicate and transfer btc directly without using SR? OK, its true, that if everybody does it this way, no vendor is able to build up reputation, so you can`t find out, who is honest and who is not. Also you don`t have no escrow. But on the other hand, there is less or no incriminating data !?<br /><br />what do you think?

				I&#039;m sure this has happened and will continue to happen. Once mutual trust has been built up between a vendor and a buyer over the course of enough SR transactions (for which SR has received multiple 5% commissions), why not? <br /><br />Caveat emptor though.

				I didn`t know, that SR takes commission for each sale...<br />If it is like this, they are probably not that happy about my suggestion.

				I&#039;m pretty new around here, but i don&#039;t really get the feeling commission is the &quot;driving factor&quot; for SR...<br /><br />I don&#039;t see anything wrong with making contacts. On the other hand though, SR is taking a lot of security considerations off your hands, prolly much better than you&#039;d be able to do on your own, so you might want to reserve these types of contacts for after a good number of successful transactions on here.
