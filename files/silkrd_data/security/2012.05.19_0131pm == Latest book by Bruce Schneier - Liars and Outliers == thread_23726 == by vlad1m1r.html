				I have just started on Security Guru&#039;s Bruce Schneier&#039;s book on the subject of trust - both in social and technical terms, it&#039;s been a very interesting read so far so I thought I&#039;d upload a copy to Torland for anyone who wants it, please find the link below.<br /><br />There are some parts highly relevant to many of the issues we face here on SR to do with transparency and accountability and I&#039;d particularly recommend this to new buyers and sellers on the Road.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We don’t demand a background check on the plumber who shows up to fix the leaky sink. We don’t do a chemical analysis on food we eat.<br /><br />Trust and cooperation are the first problems we had to solve before we could become a social species. In the 21st century, they have become the most important problems we need to solve—again. Our global society has become so large and complex that our traditional trust mechanisms no longer work.<br /><br />Bruce Schneier, world-renowned for his level-headed thinking on security and technology, tackles this complex subject head-on. Society can’t function without trust, and yet must function even when people are untrustworthy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Source : https://www.schneier.com/book-lo.html<br /><br />For anyone interested in computer security, Schneier&#039;s e-magazine Cryptogram which has been around since 1998 will give you all the latest in the world of e-security straight to your inbox. His website is also a great place to learn about the basics of encryption algorithims (which might have something to do with the fact he helped to build a good number of them!)<br /><br />Happy reading!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />Download link to book : http://utovvyhaflle76gh.onion/sTORage/vlad1m1r/books/LiarsandOutliers.epub

				Thanks mate this looks extremely interesting. Including this one I now have over a hundred books on my phone that I really want to read...unfortunately the list is increasing faster than i can read them. Its a sobering thought that even if you read 100 books a year(which at my peak I reckon I acheived; sadly fallen off now to about 50 due to having kids!) you would still be lucky to top 5000 books in your lifetime...so choose carefully! Don&#039;t waste your time on Harry Potter!

				Well said Hungry Ghost!<br /><br />Having said this your reading speed will increase as you read more and more. I bought a Kindle a couple of years ago and am convinced I&#039;ve read less than a tenth of the ones on there!<br /><br />I have been a bit disappointed with the Libraries available in Torland as they seem to focus on methods to kill people or are long treatises on dated conspiracy theories. I am hoping to start a modest collection of books for general interest reading and will post as and when more promising titles become available.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23726.msg248687#msg248687">Quote from: Hungry ghost on May 19, 2012, 02:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks mate this looks extremely interesting.

				It might be worth creating a thread or STORage page where we can post pirate books. There&#039;s a fair selection on pirate bay but you have to trawl through a lot of crap. I&#039;m not sure how exactly to set it up but I envision a place where anyone can upload a good book to. I&#039;ve amassed a fair few science and skeptical type books. Like you say a lot of stuff on TOR seems to be sub anarchists cookbook type rubbish. I used to frequent a site called Bluelight a few years ago and they used to have good book and film threads. The advantage of TOR is we could post links to the actual files.

				Hmm ok so I can just create a folder in sTORage but there&#039;s no way to prevent malicious deletion. It would be good if it were possible to password lock a folder against deletion . Still it might be worth a try and see if it survives.

				Thanks Guru,<br /><br />I was just a little worried about posting torrent links as if someone were to click them inside the Tor browser it might compromise their anonymity, plus I really don&#039;t want to give the impression it&#039;s OK to download torrented files via the Tor network! Ideally there&#039;d be a hosting service for people to have their own onion site but I understand that ship has since sailed unless you&#039;ve an invitation from an existing member!<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23726.msg248911#msg248911">Quote from: Guru on May 19, 2012, 06:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23726.msg248897#msg248897">Quote from: Hungry ghost on May 19, 2012, 06:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">It might be worth creating a thread or STORage page where we can post pirate books.
