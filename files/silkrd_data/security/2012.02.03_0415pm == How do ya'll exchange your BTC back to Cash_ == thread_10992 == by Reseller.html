				If you&#039;re serious about BTC trading check out the <br />#bitcoin-otc (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin-otc) IRC channel. Those people are more into the financial trading aspects of it. Other than I would just find a reputable exchange that cashes out, but there will definitely be some kind of fee.

				Srsly? Just cash it out on an exchange?<br /><br />Fees are the least important thing to worry about. As soon as your BTC hits gox, it&#039;s under AML scrutiny. You have to give your government&#039;s tax agency some excuse as to why that money was earned legitimately, and mtgox will not help you claim it&#039;s trading income. A $7K EFT deposit in your bank account from dwolla.com is gonna look a little suspicious. You can&#039;t just list it on your 1040 without becoming an audit target.<br /><br />This problem will get worse for Deep Web merchants doing their 2012 taxes next year. A year of economic growth is sure to produce some people who earn their entire living on the Deep Web, and a lot of them will live in Fascist countries like the United States. Most of them will be new to money laundering, and are at risk of doing it wrong and getting caught.<br /><br />OTC won&#039;t help you: That channel is full of folks who think that SR tarnishes the image of Bitcoin by its very existence. Their advice will be to turn yourself in.<br /><br />Tumbling your Bitcoins and then cashing them out is not proper laundering of your money. The money ain&#039;t clean until you can declare it to the IRS without becoming an audit target.<br /><br />We need to start coming up with ways to make the cash we get out of our BTCs look legal.<br />

				If you&#039;re planning on declaring it could you not say it was profits from speculation. Some people make big bucks and that&#039;s gonna be hard to disprove. Another way I can think of is say you run a cash bitcoin exchange. A few places sell gold for btc too, although anything you can buy and then sell will work.

				I think the first question to answer is, what do you want to do with the money?&nbsp; If you want to buy groceries, gas, and other small items that are often paid for with cash, I would sell them for MPs on SR.&nbsp; Expect this to be a long process.<br /><br />If you want to buy something like a house or car, you have a little more work cut out for you.&nbsp; If you&#039;re expecting regular income, you need to make it look like you&#039;re running a business when you make deposits.&nbsp; For example, a $1000 deposit the first week of every month (or whatever amount, but be somewhat consistent).&nbsp; If it&#039;s regularly happening, then it could easily be a normal job&#039;s pay, and people wouldn&#039;t look twice.&nbsp; If it&#039;s sporadic, both with numbers and frequency, it&#039;s abnormal.<br /><br />With that amount of money, you&#039;re also coming up against AML&#039;s.&nbsp; For example, you can&#039;t just walk into a bank and deposit $5000+ in cash without filling out a form.&nbsp; In fact, depending on the amount, the form is &quot;optional&quot; (they&#039;ll fill it out for you if you refuse, whether you make the deposit or not).<br /><br />Careful careful careful.....

				So if you just send, say, $500 every two weeks from your SR account to Dwolla and your bank account, should you even report it on your taxes or would that just look more suspicious?&nbsp; If the bank doesn&#039;t report deposits of less than $5000, how would the IRS know?&nbsp; That is, if everything else you did was legal.

				Maybe I&#039;m missing something that should be painfully obvious - but where&#039;s the real downside in using an exchange?&nbsp; BTC isn&#039;t an illegal currency.&nbsp; Converting it to and from some other currency isn&#039;t illegal.&nbsp; Suppose I were to go overseas and exchange a bunch of currency X for currency Y.&nbsp; Maybe I don&#039;t spend it all while I&#039;m over there, and I come back with a lot left over and I need to turn it back into currency X.&nbsp; Then I go to the bank and I redeposit it, because I don&#039;t want to have a ton of cash sitting in my house.&nbsp; Even if the bank has to fill out the CTR (amounts over $10,000) - that doesn&#039;t really mean squat - it doesn&#039;t mean you made some illegal profits - hell, it doesn&#039;t even mean you made *any* profit - it just means that you have a bunch of cash that exceeds the threshold for reporting and they have to fill out a form.&nbsp; It&#039;s when you try to evade that reporting requirement that you run the risk of getting well and truly fucked.<br /><br />For those of you in the US, think about this.&nbsp; If you go to Las Vegas, and you win a slot machine jackpot or a sports book payout of over $1200, they have to give you a W-2G and report that income to the IRS.&nbsp; However, suppose that instead you decide that you&#039;re smarter than that, and instead of playing the slots, you sit down and play blackjack for awhile.&nbsp; A few hours later, you cash out $25,000.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; The casino is not required to report that to the IRS - and they don&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;m not exactly sure on the reason why, but I believe it has to do with the fact that with table games, they really can&#039;t prove how much of what you&#039;re cashing out is actually *income/winnings* and how much of it might have been your original buy-in.&nbsp; With a slot machine jackpot, they can definitively say that your bet of $1 resulted in a win of $2500, and boom, you now have reportable income (which you can then offset by all those times you went to Vegas and lost).<br /><br />One other thought.&nbsp; Suppose you do have enough BTC that you can send $500 in BTC to Dwolla.&nbsp; Start a &quot;real&quot; business.&nbsp; Put up a website for your business and say that you accept BTC.&nbsp; Maybe even do some real work in addition to whatever it is that you did to get your BTC.&nbsp; Or use your BTC to get your business off the ground - and then you can deduct your business expenses.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing illegal about any of this -- except maybe whatever it was you did to get your BTC in the first place, but if you didn&#039;t break any laws there either -- I&#039;m just not sure what you have to worry about.&nbsp; Remember, Al Capone got busted for tax evasion.

				It may not be illegal to go for a walk in 2 in the morning while wearing black, but it is suspicious. If a cop sees you doing it, you&#039;ll get searched, ID&#039;d, checked for warrants, and asked where you&#039;re going and why.<br /><br />The same thing may go for &quot;abnormal&quot; transactions. A CTR isn&#039;t a warrant for your arrest. But the purpose of a CTR and AML algorithms is to put you under police scrutiny, so that if you are doing something illegal, they can find out and bust you for it.<br /><br />Once the police single you out and start asking questions, you&#039;re already fucked, because if they&#039;re asking you questions, that means they&#039;re also watching your house, going through your bank records, tapping your phone and Internet connection, and infiltrating your circle of friends.<br /><br />Our goal is to not even raise the slightest suspicion about what we do, and where we get the money to do it.<br /><br />

				Why don&#039;t you travel to Panama (or another tax haven) and open an account.<br /><br />Transfer your (clean) BTC to a place like MtGox, CryptoXchange, Intersango, etc and make a wire transfer to that Panama account. If you&#039;re not going to move huge amount of money, just have a debit card (or a second from another bank) to withdraw at ATMs.

However, there&#039;s a pretty big problem with your idea about running a BTC-based business: Real BTC businesses tend to also accept USD, which is where they make the majority of their money, because the Bitcoin market is miniscule. If you make $100,000 in Bitcoins but only $100 in USD in a year, it&#039;s going to look suspicious because none of the legitimate players have that income pattern, so you&#039;re going to get caught. <br /><br />In fact, I&#039;d say if the Feds wanted to round up all the SR sellers, all they&#039;d have to do is ask the banks, Dwolla, and Mt. Gox for their records (which they&#039;ll gladly give) and do some traffic analysis. Whoever&#039;s income is more than 60% not-recently-mined Bitcoins (at the time of their deposit to Mt. Gox) is probably a SR seller. <br />

Keep in mind that these 100 cases happened in the 1990s, and since then computing technology has made it much easier for Big Brother to watch us. What took months of investigating back then might be completely automated today, especially in that financial panopticon known as the United States.

				A Corporation (shelf or new), and a vague IT consulting/parts reselling/wholesale importing type cover story would be a good bet for a long term cover solution. Buy a dozen graphics cards and sell them for BTC, Help out a few friends by running virus scans their computers and write up invoices for &quot;6 hours of IT consulting work&quot; (paid in cash, of course). Buy bulk flash drives or cell phone covers or swedish penis pumps bulk from china, and split the packages and resell on ebay (increase in/out mail flow, makes packing materials, frequent shipping seems normal, etc.). Funnel as many Bitcoins as you can to moneypak cards and use those for buying everyday expenses and more bitcoins (if you can prove bank transfers -in- to Mt. Gox, then there&#039;s a great reason as to why you would be withdrawing to cash via bank transfer from there as well.) <br /><br />By cycling money through legitimate BTC trades, creating records for cash from consulting work, and a bunch of random wholesale reselling, you&#039;re just a regular IT geek entrepreneur type.

Cash deposits (no matter the reason given), wire transfers to or from foreign countries, MoneyPaks, and anything that isn&#039;t what a typical person would do will get a SAR filed against your account. <br /><br />Bankers don&#039;t just look for suspicious *types* of transactions. They attempt to fully understand the inner details of your business. If your business is making a lot of money, they will want to see documentation, prepared *properly* by an accountant, that shows where your revenue comes from and what your expenses are. If you don&#039;t have the documentation to prove your money is legit (or you refuse to show it because you think you have 5th Amendment rights), that&#039;s enough to justify surveillance, search warrants, etc.<br /><br />This means that your shell company has to have innards that appear legit. Your company&#039;s income has to be in the form of payment most commonly used by your shell company&#039;s supposed industry. If most legit companies that sell widgets only accept cashier&#039;s checks and you take all your payments in gold bars because that is the easiest thing to buy with your dirty money, the banks will pick up on that like a pack of wolves picks up on the scent of blood.<br /><br />If your shell company is pretending to be in an industry that you know nothing about, you&#039;ll get the internal details wrong and get caught. The banks know how legitimate companies operate, and can tell if you don&#039;t belong.<br /><br />The type of business whose internals are easiest for the uninitiated (ie, us) to guess without actual experience is any type of consumer-facing Internet services company, such as advertising, games, porn, etc, because everything they do is pretty much exposed to the public. These companies typically accept PayPal and credit card payments from customers, and the only business expenses are hosting and labor. I suppose, if you could build such a site, which would be no small undertaking, you could then purchase anonymous pre-paid VISA cards with your Bitcoins, and use the cards to &quot;pay&quot; for memberships on your site. <br /><br />The strengths of this approach are:<br /><br />* No suspiciously BTC-heavy income<br /><br />* No suspicious cash, MoneyPaks, or other inherently suspicious types of transaction.<br /><br />* Your company&#039;s bank records can easily be made absolutely, 100% typical for the industry. <br /><br />* The process can work for small vendors as well as large ones.<br /><br />The weaknesses (and questions):<br /><br />* Your site would have a lot of purchases with cards from the same obscure vendor. Is this a problem?<br /><br />* You need to throttle the apparent growth of your company. A J-curve of revenue growth is suspicious.<br /><br />* The debit cards would have a bunch of purchases from your shell company on them and nothing else. Would banks pick up on this?<br /><br />* LE may be able to estimate what your revenue *should* be by appraising the content. This would be checked against actual revenue.<br /><br />

				Turn on a few trusted friends to SR. Tell them to spread the word. Offer them bitcoins at a cheap rate i.e. 0-5%. They&#039;ll buy your coins, their friends will want to buy coins from them. It&#039;s cheaper and faster than the exchanges for them, and puts cash right in your hand. Win-win. Obviously there are limits to how big you would want this web of coin buyers to get, but if you could keep most of them one link in the chain away from you, and that link was very trusted, you&#039;d probably be fine. For a low volume vendor this would be pretty ideal IMO.&nbsp;

				This topic is growing and might become huge.<br /><br />If you want to cash bitcoins, there&#039;s plenty of options that wont put you in trouble.<br /><br />For money laundering, realize it&#039;s not easy. There&#039;s many methods to do it properly and even more to get caught.<br /><br />My recommendations are:<br />Buy gold coins. They&#039;re liquid, small and the government can&#039;t print it. And if you&#039;re lucky you might make more money if they increase in value. Hide them away from home and in different places.<br />When you have enough money, get an accountant willing to work with you and knows about the sector you want to do business. The business income should be realistic. Most businesses don&#039;t make a dime in the first months (growth should be slow).<br /><br />Again, you can get caught for reasons you can barely imagine. I saw one guy who opened a laundry to wash money. He was making unrealistic profit and the bank snitched on him. The investigators simply checked the water bills and he got busted. He could keep the machines on (wasting water) all day but eventually an investigator could stay a week writing how many customers really entered his business and he&#039;ll eventually get screwed. It&#039;s not easy to launder money and if you get attention and start being investigated, it is even harder to avoid getting busted.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think you can fool people who are paid and trained (for years) to bust you. Like every business, you have to start small. If you want to have a comfortable life, try to maintain a low profile. Buy a decent car (paying for as long as possible, even if its going to cost another car after a few years). Don&#039;t get a mortgage, RENT! Certainly not a mansion but a nice place that won&#039;t get that much attention. Those are the things more difficult to conceal. For the rest, it is much easier. When you buy groceries, pay with a debit card not related to your persona. If you buy stuff online, the same. Authorities can&#039;t go inside your house and check what possessions you have. Go to a restaurant every day and pay with cash or debit card. And NEVER use that card in places that can be linked to you. If you buy plane tickets with that card, that could be a problem in the future.

				Buy one prepaid card and use someone else name/documentation to register. Charge them online with an amount for your daily/weekly or monthly expenses. Never put more money than you&#039;re willing to lose. Check the laws on your country to see how hard it is to get one.<br /><br />It all depends of your profile and how paranoid you are. The safest option would be to create enough for your monthly expenses. Let&#039;s say you have 5 cards and you can withdraw up to a 1000usd/day. Charge them online with a thousand bucks each and go to an ATM with sunglasses and a hat (or anything to cover your face, scars, tattoos, etc). Withdraw 1000usd from each card and leave the area (park far away to be sure you plate is not recorded). If you&#039;re a guy who always wear a suit, put something very casual just the days you do the withdrawals got it? <br /><br />Now you have 5 thousand in CASH and a hard trace to follow. If you do this once or twice a month in different areas (far from home) and in different hours (no patterns), I believe it will be very difficult for a LEO to bust you. Hide the debit cards when you&#039;re not using and/or keep a &quot;clean&quot; one for normal expenses.<br /><br />Ideally you will not start laundering money until you stopped doing illegal business. If you get busted you might lose your laundry/legal business and all the money you cleaned up.<br /><br />I think it is a pretty safe method. Any objections?

Also, prepaid cards can have very strict restrictions about how much you can spend with a single purchase. Since 9/11 the government cracked down on all this stuff a lot. i.e. prepaid, gift cards et al.<br /><br />The devil is in the details.

I don&#039;t think them all are blacklisted.<br /><br />After you register them once, I don&#039;t think you need to do much about it. Keep your stash in YOUR bitcoin wallet. Send bitcoins to different platforms like mtgox, cryptoxchange, bitcoinica, intersango... The more the better since you can dissolve the transfers and get less attention. Go online in each of them and transfer the amount you&#039;re going to withdraw that day to your debit cards.<br /><br />You could use only 2 cards and withdraw once a week (1000 bucks). The amount of debit cards you need depend of your needs (how much money you need and how much you can withdraw at the ATM). If you&#039;re only able to withdraw 500 bucks, go to the ATM twice a month (in my previous example).<br /><br />About the limit, it depends of the card and the country.<br /><br />IMHO the worst case scenario is having the funds blocked. That&#039;s why you should keep the money in YOUR wallet.

Avoiding being flagged is easy it just costs you more in rake, regarding the volume it would make it less believable but definitely not beyond reasonable doubt. You could easily have rich Russian friends you met online that enjoy playing you all the time, that also prefer using anonymous currencies. But yes, an increased site volume would make it less suspicious.

I&#039;m not saying it would be flagged but it COULD. Moving money in/out fast MIGHT be a red flag. That&#039;s why you choose different platforms so in case one bitcoin account or prepaid card gets blocked, you still have more. Don&#039;t mix them.<br /><br />ie. Intersango goes with card 1. mtgox with card 2... For intersango, you&#039;re just a guy who moves a thousand pounds to the same card monthly. That&#039;s not suspicious since it is periodic and does not involve a large sum.

Western union is the first place LE looks for illegal activity. You may be using a fake ID, But keep in mind you have to fill out a form to cash out from WU. Make sure you leave no finger prints on that form.

				There&#039;s an 60 minutes episode showing an ex swiss banker snitching on US clients expecting to be compensated for his &quot;services to the US government&quot;. The IRS pays you around 30% of the amount they can get from a person you snitch on! Funny though he didn&#039;t get the money and got arrested. Probably there was too many corrupt politicians in those accounts.<br /><br />http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6050196n
