				I&#039;ve been trying to wrap my head around the intermediate services and techniques people use to get their fiat into SR. Take an exchanger like bitinstant, you deposit cash into their account at a bank or convenience store. At this point all you&#039;ve done is buy bitcoins, and all anyone knows about you is your image. You can deposit directly into your SR wallet, or run it through a bazillion other services that will all take their cut and add considerably to the complexity and wait. Now your SR wallet doesnt have a big label on it that says &quot;im a SR wallet, im used to buy illegal goods&quot;, its just a wallet like any other, and because SR uses a tumbler for purchases then there&#039;s no way to trace the money in that wallet to the sellers account should he ever get busted. So why then all the extra steps? You&#039;ve never revealed your ip to bitinstant or any other service, theres nothing that connects you to anything thats going on, and unless your seller is a cop...well, it wouldnt matter how many services you ran it through, all they would need to do is show footage of you depositing enough cash at the bank to cover whatever you bought from them. Correct me if in wrong here, but if there&#039;s nothing linking your SR wallet to SR, then theres no reason to obfuscate it.

				I personally don&#039;t worry about it that much. I either have them sent directly to my SR account or into my Bitcoin wallet then I transfer it myself to SR.<br /><br />But having said that I only purchase small quantities of weed for personal use from a reputable domestic vendor. I highly doubt that the police will be pulling surveillance footage from the bank and attempting to trace bitcoin transfers for 7 grams of bud, I&#039;m more likely to get busted by purchasing from local suppliers.

It&#039;s also possible SR is itself run by LE. Assume it is. SR has a record of every BTC in to your account name, assume hackers have gotten it or will have gotten this log. Assume SR has never deleted a message, and that all your history is in a nice long clear text log, unless you&#039;ve used GPG/PGP like many such as Pine suggest.<br /><br />Its up to you who you trust, but at the end of the day you&#039;re better off with no paper trails. Paranoia? Maybe. Reason to not use SR? no.

				This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. It&#039;s equally as naive as saying &quot;Why wipe your arse after taking shit when nobody can tell if you have a dirty arse or not?&quot;. Why do you wipe your arse when you take a shit? So you have a clean arse and don&#039;t mess yourself. What happens if the police smell dirty shit? They investigate and arrest you. Dumbass. <br /><br />Also laundering your BTC is actually relatively inexpensive to do if you are a vendor here that aims for longevity and isn&#039;t just a flash in the pan. With my set up which is the one I teach to my clients apart from the implementation costs there are no massive recurring fees after it&#039;s been all be organised and it simplifies the whole process. People make it more complicated than it needs to be by using silly rechargeable debit cards and kid-shit like that.

Like raven92 said, the only reason to do that as a buyer is if your paranoid that SR is run by LEO, but bigger risk is seller being leo.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />..or as I said the very fact that you&#039;ve bought Bitcoins can be used against you if, for example you&#039;ve signed for a package containing contraband and try to claim you did so in good faith, unaware there was anything illegal inside. Use cash to buy your BTC or sell goods/services to get them and you can obtain them in total anonymity - even I don&#039;t know my clients&#039; real names or identities which is the way it should be in my humble opinion!<br /><br />V.
