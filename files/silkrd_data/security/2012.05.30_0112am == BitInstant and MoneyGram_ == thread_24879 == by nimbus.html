				Has anyone successfully sent money via MoneyGram to BitInstant? I heard from someone that when she tried it there was some kind of weird computer glitch and it wouldn&#039;t take the deposit to that particular account...<br /><br />I have not tried it yet, but this method seems a little more of a hassle than bank deposits due to the form you need to fill out with lots of personal details. I think you would be OK using fake info and as long as you stay under $900 they will not ask for ID. There are way more MG locations than bank branches though, so it could be very convenient for a lot of people.

				I just did this at a very well known retailer and by the time I got home, maybe 10 minutes, they had the money and I had the coins. Was actually a lot easier than the bank and they didn&#039;t ask for I.D. so fake info will work. IMO works a lot better than depositing at a bank because trustcash was really slow for me and took a few hours.

				getting bitcoins is easier everyday as more people put their talents to invest in more efficient uses.&nbsp; The utility of money it can be called, but it is in the truest sense an adaptation to its needed utility.&nbsp; &nbsp;
