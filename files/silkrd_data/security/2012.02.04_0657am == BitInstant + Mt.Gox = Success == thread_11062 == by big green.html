				I&#039;ve been tired of fucking around with these MP to BTC dealers. No one wants to play with me and HEY that&#039;s completely fine with me if there are supply problems or other issues that I don&#039;t know about... but it&#039;s frustrating for me to be in possession of a MoneyPak and I keep getting turned down by the BTC vendors. <br /><br />So today I became proactive and solved the problem. <br /><br />I did a quick research and almost did the Dwolla thing, but I didn&#039;t like the time frames involved. Signed up on MT.GOX and noticed that they have an option for BitInstant... I looked at it, and decided I would make a deposit at the bank and see what happens. BitInstant makes it extremely quick and easy. I chose a bank nearby, deposited the cash, didn&#039;t have to supply any personal info whatsoever, none. By the time I got home to check my mt.gox, I had the MT.GOX confirmation code in my email. I used it to get the money into MT.GOX which I used to purchase BTC. <br /><br />Took me less than 45 minutes. <br /><br />BitInstant. BOOM very amazing service.

				Yep, that&#039;s the way. And from Mt. Gox straight to SR. If you use a nondescript user name there with a tormail address nothing really passes through your fingers. Unfortunately you usually can&#039;t get to Mt. Gox through Tor.
