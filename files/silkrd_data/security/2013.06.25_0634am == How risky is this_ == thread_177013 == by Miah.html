				I came into a contact with a supplier about 4 months ago overseas. I ordered from them once before but the package was intercepted by a family member but from what I was told the product was legit. I guess my question is how risky is it to order from a supplier overseas. The shipping is as stealth as possible, my drop location is secure but I don&#039;t if I&#039;m being too paranoid but I&#039;m always wondering if it&#039;s some sort of sting operation. I know it seems highly unlike but it&#039;s a constant thought. The other thing is that this supplier actual used to supply for a vendor on SR and this vendor has been MIA now for the past month. It could be totally unrelated though but just wanted to get some advice from some experienced ppl that have ordered from overseas. <br /><br />It&#039;s just going to being small personal amounts but maybe after once I feel safe I&#039;ll order bigger amounts but I&#039;m thinking what if that&#039;s what happened to the above mentioned vendor. It was weird he came out with the product pushed it 3 or 4 times in large amounts and then disappeared. Idk,...

				Whatever instigated that vendor&#039;s disappearance (if they were even supplied by the person you want to order from...) at your end is purely speculative; maybe they realized that the SR game was a bit too much work for them, or maybe they got into a situation where they couldn&#039;t keep up with orders and decided to call it quits.<br />That said, nobody will be able to give you a finite &quot;amount&quot; of risk that this order would entail and it&#039;s really up to you to decide how much risk you&#039;re comfortable with--you&#039;re ordering drugs on the internet, internationally.&nbsp; Personally, if the stealth is good and you trust--to a degree--the vendor you&#039;re buying from, I&#039;d be comfortable enough to order.&nbsp; I have a friend who orders decent quantities of K off of the clearnet, internationally, and none of his packages have been seized.&nbsp; However, judging by your language and rationalization, you seem to be pretty paranoid about it, so it might not be the best thing for you to do.

				I doubt we can talk you in to it, as you seem pretty determined to talk yourself out of ordering.

				It&#039;s not a SR Vendor. I&#039;m not scared about that. This is outside of SR.<br />

				It&#039;s tempting being able to buy the products directly from him insteading of paying double for those same items here on SR. So then how do Vendors on SR get their products? I&#039;m sure for pain pills there&#039;s some that buy them off other people with legit scripts or have mules that will go in and get the scripts. But I know for a fact that a lot of them get theirs from countries like India and China just by looking at the brand name they are selling. I&#039;m still 50/50 on this. If it helps I&#039;m ordering less than 100.
