				Hey everyone,<br />So , as the topic states, what do you think is &quot;safer&quot; ?<br /><br />option 1 : Installing lubuntu on disk on key (This is bootable through VMware player using &quot;Plop Boot Manager&quot; ISO. Encryption is only when entering the operating system and home folder encryption.<br /><br />option 2 : Installing lubuntu locally on a virtual machine - full encryption (This requires password on boot and on entering the operating system.)<br /><br />Thanks in advance to any repliers!

				Well, Im new to linux, and saw a good tutorial in these forums about installing lubuntu with full encryption on a vmware.<br /><br />Now im trying to move on to lubuntu on disk onkey - as i will only use it(+vpn) for browsing SR.<br /><br />trying to stay anonymous and safe.

				Are you saying, in other words, that you plan to install a bootable Lubuntu on a usb key?&nbsp; That could be a fair option for you, as far as starting points and generality go. <br /><br />Are you saying that you have thought about accessing the usb key housed Lubuntu from within some virtual machine which is located on a local disk (HDD)? If so, that would be your local machine in operation and then booting a virtual machine (via your vmware example) to then using that virtual machine (OS) to open the OS (Lubuntu) on the usb key.&nbsp; This sounds unnecessary and problematic, and by the green tone of your technical jargon I advise you to reign in the cattle on that plan. <br /><br />So back to option... three?&nbsp; Lubuntu installed on an encrypted, bootable USB key.....&nbsp; Generally speaking, and with a handfull of salt, I say that option #3 could be a worthwhile start.&nbsp; Mind you, your OS is only one piece of the picture.<br /><br />Furthermore, and just really a thought here - but do you really wish to let thousands of people know how you plan to access information, or would you rather remain private about that?&nbsp; Like I said that I said before, I feel that option #3 that I have described sounds potentially fine for a start for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you familiar with the notion of KISS?&nbsp; More advice that I have for you is to stay aware of what your computer software is doing with your instructions, so take some time for yourself and learn as much as you can about Linux, networking protocols, and cryptology.&nbsp; Learn how your privacy can be destroyed and then learn to disallow that.&nbsp; The list goes on, but you must &quot;start&quot; somewhere - so I implore you to make it a safe start.<br /><br />
