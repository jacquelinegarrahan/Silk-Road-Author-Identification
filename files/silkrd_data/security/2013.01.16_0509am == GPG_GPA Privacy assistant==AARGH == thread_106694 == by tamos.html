				Ok, so I&#039;m no computer whiz, but after much research, I&#039;ve been able to encrypt for some time. Now, all of a sudden, I try to import a key--and get the error message &quot;no keys found,:I use the GPG4win &quot;lite&quot; version--without Kleopatra, because THAT was my problem in the beginning--I had no way of copying the file.. So I figured out that the lite version without Kleo--and the GPA assistant was the way to go.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to find much online as far as problem solving on issues with GPG. IF there are posts, it&#039;&#039;s where you have to actually write the code. I&#039;d rather avoid anymore difficulty. I tried downloading it again, So my next step is to uninstalll and start over.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found much complaints about unreliability of GPG--but no remedies.<br /><br />If anyone can help me remedy this, I&#039;d be grateful! I don&#039;t use it with any email program--just to encrypt on SR.<br /><br />Windows OS

				-First things first, you&#039;re going to need a program to encrypt/decrypt text. Go to google (or any search engine) and download the latest version of gpg4win.<br />-When Installing, you will receive a prompt with a bunch of check mark boxes; Make doubly sure that the GPA box is checked (you will be using this program to encrypt/decrypt text.<br />-Now that you have GPA, you are going to have to make yourself a public key (I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed that many (if not all) vendors have a public key.<br />-In GPA, on the top, you will see an option for KEYS; Click it. It will ask you for a name (use a fake name). Then an e-mail address (use a fake one as well). Its your choice whether or not to make a backup.<br />-Now you have to make a pass phrase. I recommend using a 20 character or more passphrase.<br />---------------------------Now you have your Public Key-----------------------------<br />-Now to be able to post and send you public key (you need send this to you vendor if you want him to be able to decrypt your text).<br />-Click your newly created Key, and there should be an option to export your key. Export it to your desktop, and open it via notepad (not microsoft word; NOTEPAD).<br />-This is your public key. Save it for later.<br /><br />*Deep Inhale*<br /><br />-Now remember I said many (if not all) vendor will have a public key? Well, go to your vendor of choice and copy their public key. Paste it in NOTEPAD, and save it to your desktop.<br />-In GPA you will see an import button. Click it and go to desktop, and open the file with your vendors PGP key.<br />-GPA will automatically rip the vendors key and save it.<br /><br />-----------Now you have a key, and you have your vendors key-----------<br /><br />Now for sending messages......<br /><br />-In GPA you will see a clipboard option.<br />(Now, this part is only if you intend to send your name and address to your vendor)<br />-Type in your message and click encrypt; select your vendors name and click OK (Do NOT sign)<br />-You now have an encrypted message.<br /><br />That&#039;s all there is to it. Practice makes perfect.<br /><br />When you make your first order, you will be given an option to send a message.<br /><br />Send your public key along with your (encrypted) message. And you&#039;re done.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I know it&#039;s difficult at first, and if you have anymore question, please don&#039;t hesitate to ask.<br /><br />Silk Road is full of helpful and insightful people, willing to help.<br /><br />I really hope this wasn&#039;t too confusing. :)

				Here is a basic, simple guide I wrote, which should help you out if your using a Windows system (Gpg4win)<br />You could also use gpg4usb. This is a link to astor&#039;s tutorial - http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br />&nbsp;It has a simple interface and is easier to use for beginners.<br /><br />1. Copy the Public Key of the person you want to send a message to.<br />2. Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the Public Key. Name the file and save it to your desired location on your PC.<br />3. Open GPA (Gpg4win), click IMPORT, locate the file you just saved with the Public Key in it, and double click it. It will then show up in KEY MANAGER where it is stored for future use along with any other Public Keys you wish to keep.<br />4. Then click on CLIPBOARD, the 2nd icon in from the right at the top of the page. Type the message you wish to send to the recipient and then click ENCRYPT. Click on the Public Key of the person your sending the message to (should now be highlighted), then click OK at the bottom.<br />5. Then copy the encrypted message and paste it in a PM to the recipient and send it,<br />6. REMEMBER - Include your Own Public Key in this message if you wish to receive an encrypted response from the recipient. You can find this by RIGHT-CLICKING your key in KEY MANAGER, then copy/pasting it. :)
