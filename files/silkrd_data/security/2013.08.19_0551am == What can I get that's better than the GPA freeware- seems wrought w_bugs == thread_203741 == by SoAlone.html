				Sorry, but I&#039;ve had nothing but problems, and I&#039;m not alone. Not in principal, just functionality, bugs, etc. One minute it decrypts, next it doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />Then I go in the next day, and try to decrypt the same message and it does so flawlessly. Should I get Symantec or something or is this open source freeware still the way to go? <br /><br />Please don&#039;t hit me with too much tech jargon. I get the gist of it, and I begrudgingly came to this scene dragging my feet, but I&#039;m here. Go easy on me!!

If someone is making you do something you don&#039;t feel comfortable with, tell an adult you trust, like a teacher. No one has that right.<br /><br /><br />as above GPG4USB is much simpler.

				Thanks both of you. I guess I&#039;ll delete it and redownload it. <br /><br />@HungryGhost - I needed that one. Been a rough few. Not PGP related, just life. <br /><br />Thanks guys.<br /><br />[edit] - My USB ports have been fried along with my sound in/out, spkrs etc. + Cam. - Wouldn&#039;t you know it, 4 months after warranty expires. <br /><br />Checked continuity and power is going to them, but I did jar the laptop one day. OK, I dropped it. Hairline crack in MB? Idk. <br /><br />Been getting by w/o so long until now I haven&#039;t needed those things. - Bluetooth solves my sound problem. <br /><br />Can one get by w/o using a USB stick?? I mean is it so preferable that I should motivate my lazy azz to fix this old laptop? (3 yrs old)<br /><br />I figured I got your attention, I better fess it all up.

				Thank you. A concise answer to a question that read like a novel. Thanks again. <br /><br />PS. I never picked on nerds!. (well maybe a little)
