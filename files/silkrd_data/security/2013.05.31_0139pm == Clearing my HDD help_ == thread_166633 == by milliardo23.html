				Ok so I installed tor on my computer and I want to clear any evidence of me ever having tor installed on my computer. I&#039;m also going to make a Talis drive that&#039;s why I want to clean out my hdd. First of all, I&#039;m not a power buyer and will only buy things like 10x mdma pills etc and never going to spend over 500$ in a year...maybe 250-300 give or take. Am I being too paranoid? <br /><br /><br />Ok so installed tor and pgp, a couple days ago I moved it to a usb drive and it&#039;s no longer in my computer.<br />If I want to fully get rid of the evidence will I have to swap out the hdd and reinstall everything and destroy the old drive? How often do low time buyers get busted? (VERY LOW time lol) The problem is the first time I ever used tor, I didn&#039;t know that another browser or any programs weren&#039;t suppose to be open. Only thing I used was tor and didn&#039;t change any of the settings. Am I at risk?<br /><br />

				To answer your question:<br /><br />If you really want to clear all evidence of your hard drive the best method is to destroy it but there are other methods which mean you can keep the HDD there is software out there that will write to your disk 8 times which will essentially mean that nothing can be recovered from it. I can remember one piece of software is called true delete.<br /><br />Another thing you could do is encrypt your drive using something like TrueCrypt and this will mean even if your drive got seized they wouldn&#039;t be able to access any of the information on it without the password to decrypt it.<br /><br />I do however think you are being over paranoid! Tor is not illegal its just you can do illegal things on it. The tor browser does not save any kind of trace as to what websites you have been on so even if they did find evidence of tor on your computer it would be hard to pin anything on you for it. Also the feds are not interested in small time buyers I would not worry to much about it even with the time you didn&#039;t have it configured correctly you will probably be fine as long as you now use it with the right settings!!

				You can have other browsers open and programs if you are running Tor. Just make sure that your javascript is turned off on your Tor Browser.

				The only secure way to wipe your hard drive is to do a full disk overwrite. This assumes that you have a hard disk drive and not a solid state drive. If you have a solid state drive you can use Secure Erase for full drive wiping, but not all SSDs have properly implemented Secure Erase, and therefor it isn&#039;t safe to rely on it unless you know for a fact that it works on your model. As far as hard drive wiping goes, your best option is to use ATA Secure Erase, there are several tutorials on how to do this online, just google for it. ATA Secure Erase uses firmware included in most modern drives, and it thoroughly wipes your drive, going as far as attempting to remove magnetic residue by putting the drive head off center during one of the passes. Another option is to use something like DBAN, in some cases I believe DBAN actually uses ATA Secure Erase, but in others it simply does a full drive overwrite without putting the head off track center. ATA Secure Erase and DBAN are the only two software programs I can recommend for doing a secure drive wipe. Encrypting a drive that has already had incriminating data on it relies on the implementation of the encryption program utilized, not all of them will securely erase previously deleted data nor will they encrypt previously deleted data. This means that you should not rely on FDE to act as a secure full drive wipe, unless you are fully aware of the details of the implementation of the FDE system you are using. Wiping files individually is also not suggested, in many cases there will still be data fragments left behind in various places.
