				So as many of us know, the bitinstant site is not allowing the cash deposit through moneygram into an online wallet such as blockchain. I cannot seem to find a solid explanation or alternative solution, so I was wondering are there any experienced SR users out there that would be willing to throw a little advice my way on an alternative solution to safely acquiring bitcoins with cash or any other manner deemed relatively safe? Or do you know if the bitinstant site has any intentions on being fixed. Either way any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

				Looks like you can still buy BTC with Bitinstant by using their MoneyGram payment sysstem at CVS, 711, and Wal-mart locations.

				I think the issue is that you can no longer deposit to a BTC address.<br />This makes it harder to remain anonymous.

				&nbsp;:&#039;( middle of November sounds like forever!<br />I&#039;m looking into other methods, I don&#039;t want to have to rely on trustcash, bitinstant, coinapult etc. for my only method of obtaining BTC.<br />Right now I&#039;m leaning towards a OTC method, but I haven&#039;t decided which site to use.<br />I&#039;m leaning towards localbitcoins.com<br />You meet locally, pay cash and there is a SMS based escrow system.<br />Probably not the most anonymous method, but I&#039;m confident that bouncing from a couple of instawallets and SR&#039;s tumblers are enough to keep me safe.<br />I don&#039;t think I do enough business to be worth anyone&#039;s time.<br />I hope.

				Ever since this happened I just use Mt. gox, which is still a useable option on bitinstants website, then send the coins to my blockchain wallet from there...<br />This seems to work jusst fine, but if there is anything wrong with this security wise I&#039;d appreciate it if somebody let me knew = p<br />Cheers<br />-Seshat

				So just to get this straight.... you use bitinstant, and choose cash deposit (lets say moneygram) into mt.gox. Then create the payment slip and go to the moneygram location to make the cash deposit and then the money goes into your mt. gox account from which you can then transfer from mt. gox into SR. Is that correct?

				For everyone doing the moneygram option at CVS or 7-11, how do you feel about the required phone number? I liked the Trushcash method for buying Bitcoins because at no point in the the process was any identifying information ever collected from me.

				i have done both CVS and walmart money orders and the form u fill out with your name and phone number u obviously use a made up one for anonymity. they never check IDs or actually call that number so its more just a requirment that you fill ANYTHING in those blanks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Im not 100% but from my experiences:<br /><br />Not only can you use a fake # but you should be using a fake #.<br /><br />They just use your # to look you up in the system.&nbsp; If you use the same # they will have your details (name, address, etc) already on file.&nbsp; Therefore you should use a different fake # every time.
