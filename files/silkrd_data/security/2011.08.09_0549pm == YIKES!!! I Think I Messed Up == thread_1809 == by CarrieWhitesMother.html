				Very new to all this, and very nervous. I was attempting to make my second purchase ever on SR a couple of days ago when I inadvertently sent the mailing address unencrypted. How bigga deal is this? I&#039;m trying to watch my P&#039;s and Q&#039;s on SR, I certainly don&#039;t want to annoy a Mexican Drug Lord or agitate a Dutch Hippy, and mostly I don&#039;t want to end up in the Black Maria. I immediately sent an ( encrypted) apology along with my Pub. Key but I haven&#039;t heard back from the vendor yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Should I cancel my order? would that annoy the vendor even more? have I condemned myself to a life of paranoia and bad disguises. EEEK!!! <br /><br />Like I said, I&#039;m new to this, and while I was/am totally aware of the need for encryption when *messaging* — I just didn&#039;t make the same connection when inputting the shopping cart. &quot;type address here&quot; it said, not —&quot;place *ENCRYPTED* address here&quot; so I just typed in the address and hit send...then screamed.<br /><br />I&#039;ll shut up now.<br />&nbsp;

				That was a minor blunder that probably will amount to nothing.<br />Messing up is doing something like sending a scammer your info unencrypted and your BTC directly to his wallet around escrow&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />Then you follow up by sending unencrypted info to someone who claims all of their outgoing was grabbed by LE&nbsp; ???<br /><br />THAT&#039;S messing up.

				Encrypting addresses and messages via PGP is an &quot;extra&quot; layer of security that is &quot;recommended&quot; but not &quot;required&quot;. I have read that if you&#039;re buying personal amounts, you&#039;re not selling and moving kilos of scarface cocaine, the security that SR offers in its anonymity and through Tor, is enough.

				happytree<br /><br />I&#039;d like to clear up a misconception about TOR.&nbsp; While it&#039;s anonymous, it is not necessarily &quot;private&quot;.&nbsp; Rogue exit nodes can sniff outgoing traffic, and possibly pick up plain text information.&nbsp; Always using PGP prevents this possibility, remote as it may seem.

				At least you care and are trying to do it right. I would bet only 10 percent of my orders/customers actually use pgp. Im tired of telling everyone to use it. They always say, &quot;Im trying to figure it out or Ill do it soon&quot; Good for you for doing it right from the get go..<br /><br />EVERYONE NEEDS TO USE PGP WHEN ORDERING!!! Not only does it give you a layer of anonymity, but also plausible deniability..<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about it...relax...

				Buyers need to stop working with vendors who don&#039;t offer PGP.&nbsp; That will force vendors to start using it.&nbsp; Ultimately, the goal should be vendors not dealing with people who don&#039;t use PGP either.&nbsp; While that goal seems unrealistic, it would create an almost near perfect system.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you get going with it, it&#039;s very simple to use.&nbsp; It&#039;s also kind of magical to see all those random characters turn into a meaningful message that only I can decode.&nbsp; I wish others would appreciate this side of it, instead of thinking of it as an inconvenience. Not only is it fun, it decreases paranoia and anxiety!

				Remember, the seller obviously can decrypt your address, and what they do with it from them (purposefully or inadvertently) is completely up to them.&nbsp; Using PGP on buyer--&gt;seller communications hides your address from the SR system itself (can&#039;t be stored on the SR servers, SR admins can&#039;t get to it, a compromised SR account won&#039;t be able to read it).&nbsp; That&#039;s what you are protecting yourself from by using PGP.&nbsp; It&#039;s a GoodThing, and should be encouraged.

				If you use the triple algorithm cascade feature of TrueCrypt, you can encrypt your entire drive in an absolutely invincible fashion with little to know effort. NOT doing it is the mark of a truly lazy and stupid person. It won&#039;t matter what gets saved or written to media if done in this fashion. There is absolutely no excuse, it&#039;s far too easy to do. You can even make portable file containers that you can make backups on, copy to flash media, stick it in one of those keychain pill holders, and geocache your backup.... Even if someone finds it, it&#039;s encrypted beyond the means of anything even science fiction can dream of.

				Speaking of encryption. You can encrypt a windows HD without hurting or deleting existing files, correct? but what about Mac?

				i messed up in a similar way myself yesterday, if you order multiple things and pay out the cart all at once you only put the address in once, so encrypting it for one seller means the others wont be able to decrypt it, sure its nice and convenient to only have to punch your address in once but maybe we should consider an individual checkout per seller <br /><br />on the subject ive been trying to get pgp working on my phone through apg and k9mail, although i can encrypt and send messages no problem when i get them back i get a message telling me there is no suitable secret key to decode the message, i thought we used public keys for that? they were good enough to encrypt the message first and to decrypt it on my pc. its not a major issue though, my laptop goes EVERYWHERE with me so i can always tether and get it that way (yes im a nerd)
