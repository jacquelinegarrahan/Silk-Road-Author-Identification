				Let&#039;s say that you&#039;re a small time dealer, moving &lt;$1000 of product/month. How do you cover your ass on all bases? Most if it is common sense, but there are some problems that become rather intricate. <br /><br />1. Controlled buys. You sell to someone. They get caught or they give it to a friend who ODs and they get in trouble. LE gives them a sweet deal if they help set you, the dealer, up. Let&#039;s assume that all of your sales now are controlled buys. How do you protect yourself? Consider the following scenario:<br /><br />You force all clients to use casual code-talk when they call otherwise you won&#039;t sell to them. Your person calls and wants to buy. You meet up in a very familiar club/other crowded place that doesn&#039;t have video surveillance where you can easily discern whether LE is in the building. You sit in a dark corner, out of sight. You check your man for a wire. You don&#039;t leave fingerprints on your product. You make the deal. If LE tries to hit you now, you can say that you were just meeting up to hang out and you have no idea where your man got the drugs from (assuming you aren&#039;t in possession of more product)...right? Now if LE hits you BEFORE the deal you can either swallow the drugs very quickly, or run and dispose of them in some creative way. Either way, there won&#039;t be evidence enough to convict you of possession/distribution, right? <br /><br />Would this be plausible? This method may seem paranoid, but I doubt that anybody in the drug game has ever regretted being too careful. <br /><br />2. Communication. What is the safest, most convenient way to communicate with customers? Making everybody speak in code over the phone is a hassle. Would a throw-away e-mail work? One only accessed through TOR? The thing with using that e-mail is that you lose the plausible deniability of &quot;i was just meeting my friend here to hang out&quot;. Are there any useful apps I should know about?<br /><br />3. Storage. How thoroughly do police search your house? Do they check the backyard? Would having pets (ie cats) throw off the scent of the drug dogs? I know that the usual advice is to keep a clean house, but if that isn&#039;t an option? Would taking a bunch of weed/mdma/cocaine and rubbing and/or sprinkling it on the doors/walls/floors etc of the house confuse the drug dogs to the point of not being able to find your real stash(es)? Any super-awesome hiding spots? <br /><br />Any answers to these questions would be greatly appreciated. I understand that LE monitors these forums, so if you have any sensitive info or advice that you don&#039;t want to post just PM me. I&#039;ll send you my pgp key if you want. This is my second time writing this fucking post out because my browser crashed the first time. Let me know if omitted any key points.

				Don&#039;t make buyers suck your dick. They could use forensics to link buyer and seller. i.e. your fucked more than his mouth hole is.<br /><br />Seriously though...<br /><br />1. Phones. Don&#039;t use a phone linked to you. Use a cheap throwaway. It&#039;s preferable that the buyer does the same. Swap phones regularly.<br /><br />2. Code-talk. This could help reduce your detection. But if you&#039;re under surveillance anyway, this can easily be decoded AND USED TO INCRIMINATE YOU. i.e. if you have people always asking for &#039;sugar&#039; or to meet for coffee etc. Voice recognition (software and human) is a problem so either way text or speech over phone has it&#039;s risks.<br /><br />3. Same problem with email unless you use PGP but there are still risks.... so many I can mention them here.<br /><br />4. Dealing to unknown buyers is high-risk. Then again it&#039;s hard to tell if a &#039;friend&#039; would ever dog on you anyway.<br /><br />5. Storage. If you&#039;re raided there is ALWAYS the chance they will find something. THEY WILL bash in walls and confiscate your safe if they feel like it. Best way is to never have anything on your property. Keep your stash box elsewhere (can&#039;t&nbsp; reveal those secrets). If they reasonably suspect you to have buried hundreds of thousands in your backyard, guess what! they&#039;re digging that shit up.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just bake up some brownies and smoke in every room if you have to mask up some smells.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t talk to LE. Lawyer up!

				There are a lot of threads about this in the forum, search them. <br /><br />Who needs talk over the phone when there is WhatsApp, Line, and all the other shitty apps to talk without being intercepted. If I&#039;m not wrong, Whatsapp servers don&#039;t storage logs from your chats, so is imposible to the police or anyone to collect your chats. <br /><br />Well, in other threads there is more info you can read.<br /><br />Always try to stay safe. If is too risky, don&#039;t do it. Freedom is the mos valuable thing in the Universe.

				listen if getting arrested for drug dealing is something you cannot accept then drug dealing simply isn&#039;t for you, so don&#039;t drug deal. there is an element of risk in drug dealing that you just have to accept is part of the game. any one of your clients will roll on you if they find themselves in an amount of trouble that is too deep for them to accept. <br /><br />most of that stuff you mention in the op is just way too much hassle to go to for every single deal, day in day out. you&#039;ll soon get fed up with all the fucking about and start getting lax and taking risks. best advice i can give is just don&#039;t keep any large amounts around so if you do get caught it&#039;s minimal amounts. then you can just claim social supplying, like you&#039;re just scoring for your friends to feed your own habit.
