				I am a seller and one time (about a month ago) one of my products was ordered by some kind of LE. I can&#039;t go into details but Silk Road admin agreed and blocked the user. Now, I read something recently about the DEA in Texas making SR a priority. I don&#039;t know about anyone else but I&#039;ve been receiving an unusual number of orders from Texas, and Washington DC (interestingly). Has anyone else noticed this?<br />Anyway, the point of this thread is for vendors to put the usernames of &quot;buyers&quot; they think are affiliated with Law Enforcement. I don&#039;t mean put anyone&#039;s name on here if you&#039;re just remotely suspicious. But (and I trust the judgement of fellow SR vendors) if something sounds fishy (again, I trust your judgement regarding what &quot;fishy&quot; is) with a &quot;buyer&quot; please the community know. <br />I don&#039;t think SR is nearly as secure as it was when I became part of the community. At the rate things are going, (I&#039;ve received a significant number of &quot;fishy&quot; orders/messages) I might be leaving SR. I would HATE having to do that for a ton of reasons. 1: They Win (for now) 2: SR allows us to exercise our rights as SOVEREIGN independent beings. 3: For gods sake, where the fuck else on the internet is there anything like Silk Road. So PLEASE, lets start some kind of list or something...

				thelaststand, there is no reason to leave SR, you can still go into stealth mode.<br />and make your packaging as stealth and inconspicuous as it can be and LE will have a hard time tracking back the way the packet came from.

				Ill agree that the Texas influx is from the report&#039;s.<br /><br />Maybe you should be scared, if people in Texas can figure out how to buy on SR then the FED&#039;s cant be too far behind.&nbsp; :P

				I think the biggest question is why do you give a fuck if the DEA sends you their money? If you are worried about selling to DEA, you are doing it wrong.

				Washington, DC gets a lot of supply through Embassies. They can import/export without needing to go through customs and use diplomatic tape to prevent any inspection. Embassies are self-policing. The majority don&#039;t want to be corrupt though, or attract too much attention to themselves.<br /><br />Anyway, because of all that the markets for most drugs in DC and the area are more volatile than the rest of the country. 1 guy can bring in vast quantities and then stop because he&#039;s reassigned or is getting too much scrutiny from higher ups. <br /><br />I really doubt your influx of DC customers is due to increased DEA attention. <br /><br />Source: Shhh&nbsp; :-X
