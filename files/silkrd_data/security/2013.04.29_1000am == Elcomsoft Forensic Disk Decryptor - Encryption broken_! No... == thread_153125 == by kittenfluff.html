				Someone in this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153092.0<br /><br />Dropped a bomb:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I want you people to realize something. There is software on the market that can crack PGP. Some of you already know of it. LE has it. If Atlantis is a DEA honeypot, then even if you use PGP when transferring your personal information, they could still be saving and decrypting every single one of your messages.<br /><br />I believe that Atlantis is a DEA honeypot and that the DDOS attacks are being made in order to drive users to Atlantis, where the DEA will have access to all of their communications due to the fact that they can crack your PGP.<br /><br />http://www.elcomsoft.com/efdd.html<br /><br />That&#039;s the software. If you put in an order over Atlantis, then they can store your PGP message and decrypt it at their leisure using this software.<br /><br />By Overjoyed</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> :o :&#039;(<br /><br />And I shit my knickers. I had never heard of this and was ever so slightly worried someone had gotten round the P vs NP problem or some other such thing. Maybe some kind of statistical analysis... dunno... anyhow, I had a quick nose around and thought I&#039;d post this here - there&#039;s no need to worry, but some need to alter behavior!<br /><br />First, good news - public key encryption is still totally safe! You can send PGP encrypted msgs to each other without worrying about others reading it; this software does not even claim to be able to do this!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />Now the bad news - apparently there are IT based hacks to obtain encryption keys from PCs running encrypted volumes/drives. AFAIK from what I&#039;ve just read (links at bottom of post) their software obtains the encryption keys from memory sources in the computer; hibernation memory, memory dumps, RAM etc. Biggest weakness seems to be having your computer running or in hibernation/sleep mode. I&#039;m going to scout about for a definitive list of how to prevent having your discs read, but it seems that LE would actually have to have your PC in their physical possession and have it running and logged in - probably if you&#039;re in that situation it&#039;s already too late&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Like I say, I will be looking to post better, more detailed info ASAP. But TBH I suspect that most encryption software that&#039;s effected and is open source will have new versions released that plug the loopholes.<br /><br />Let me re-iterate - LE CANNOT CRACK PGP MESSAGES THAT WE SEND. THE SOFTWARE IS ONLY USEFUL FOR DECRYPTING VOLUMES/DRIVES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.<br /><br />Check out these pages:<br /><br />https://mocana.com/blog/tag/elcomsoft-forensic-disk-decryptor/<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are caveats. For example, the computer must already be running and must be able to provide a memory dump. Thus the real danger might be when the laptop is left in hibernation, when both conditions are true.<br /><br />The workaround, therefore, is to not put your encrypted hard drive into hibernation, or at least unmount the encrypted drives before it slips into hibernation mode if using any of the encryption packages mentioned above. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://it.slashdot.org/story/12/12/20/1850201/elcomsoft-tool-cracks-bitlocker-pgp-truecrypt-in-real-time<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, this is really just exploiting retarded key control.

				Somebody claiming that RAM dumps are == to breaking encryption?! It must be a day ending in y.<br /><br />ALL encryption systems are weak to this sort of attack. If your private keys are compromised, so is the encryption. There are techniques you can use to make this sort of attack harder to pull off, but an attacker who can do this has already severely pwnt you. Either they have gained remote access to your OS, meaning you have been hacked and pwnt, or they have physical access to your computer, meaning the police kicked your door down and they are standing next to your system. Even in these cases you are not 100% weak to this sort of attack, but given that one of these two requirements must be met for you to be weak to this attack at all, you can sleep soundly still. The biggest worry would be Atlantis (or someone who compromises SR, on the seemingly reasonable assumption that we can trust DPR) doing a MITM attack on key exchange.

				Yeah - without access to the hard drive of the machine that generated the key, I don&#039;t think they have any way of decrypting encrypted messages...
