				Hello, I have a 200 dollar mp that i am thinking of trading for btc. I am thinking about using a vendor on sr who actually has it listed on his vendor page. Does that mean that i&#039;ll be protected under sr&#039;s escrow system if he\she takes my money and runs. The only reason i ask is from what i&#039;ve read alot of times vendor wants you to put mp number inside of address field when placing order. Sr rules state if i&#039;m correct that once an item is marked in transit that the address is supposed to be erased by vendor.how can i be protected when the evidence of the transfer could be erased, and there could be denial of the exchange ever taking place by the vendor even though the order was placed. Please help with any info. Thank you.

				You need to ask around about the vendor also, Look for info on the threads about him/her. <br /><br />Just cause they have a good score on the vendor page means nothing. <br /><br />If they ask u to FE DONT!! tell them you will go else where.. <br /><br />I would tell you to try RXKING but he i think only does 800+ <br /><br />MP for BTC are the biggest scams right now. I lost allot of money that way a while back
