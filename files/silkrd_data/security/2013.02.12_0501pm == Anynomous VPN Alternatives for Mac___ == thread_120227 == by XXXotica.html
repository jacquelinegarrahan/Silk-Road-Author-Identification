				Hey guys! I have cyberghost on my windows computer for web browsing but OF COURSE its not available for Mac. Does anyone know of a good alternative to Cyberghost that is available for Mac? Ive become so jaded by the knowledge of you all in the community that I really dont trust Clearnet reviews of security software anymore.

				This is one of the easier things to search for on the forum, because &quot;VPN&quot; is such a unique string. If you click that Search link at the top&nbsp; and enter &quot;VPN&quot; in the search field, then check off &quot;Search in topic titles only&quot;, you&#039;ll fine 30 threads, which include:<br /><br />What VPN services would you recommend?<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=103654.msg716449#msg716449<br /><br />Anonymous VPN?<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94693.msg670290#msg670290<br /><br />VPN advice<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26419.msg284589#msg284589<br /><br />As just a small sample. <br /><br />You&#039;ll also notice me and others repeatedly saying that no VPN is truly secure. VPN providers can see who you are and the sites you visit. They may promise not to log, but you never know when they may get a request from LE to turn on logging which they cannot refuse (and may not be allowed to tell you about).<br /><br />VPNs that promise not to log offer privacy by policy. Tor offers privacy by design -- ie, the design of the network is such that no entity has a view of the whole network. Your entry guards know who you are but not what sites you are browsing. The exit nodes know what sites you are browsing but not who are you.<br /><br />It IS possible to run a VPN over Tor, if you want an IP address that isn&#039;t blocked by the destination web site, and if you can pay for it anonymously, like with bitcoins, that might be a useful option, but a VPN alone offers zero security by design.<br />
