				For while now I have been logging on to the road with very poor security.<br />So I decided to to do some thing about that. I zero-filled my hard drive and did a full disk encryption.<br /><br />Then I installed VMware to run Liberte (as I find running it on a USB very inconvenient) but now i&#039;m getting a warning when I boot Liberte.<br />It&#039;s some thing like &quot;warning non-native environment&quot;. Can anyone tell me what that means?<br />Is it a big deal or what?

				It&#039;s simply stating that this OS was never tested in a virtual environment. AKA use at your own risk. I noticed that I receive more timeouts and network hiccups when running liberte or tails as VM vs CD or USB. Other than that everything works fine IME. Also I would highly reccomend NOT using persistence if you&#039;re using a VM as your data will be viewable from the host OS. Also not sure if you&#039;re aware but you can boot your VM FROM usb within the host OS, rather than using an OVA or ISO file to boot from.

Therefore if the app in the sandbox gets infected, you simply format the sandbox. I personally use sandboxie on my host. But it&#039;s a windows only application. There are plenty for Mac and Linux though if you search around. Also on the USB plop does work, but is a huge pain in the ass as it only uses usb1.0(slow) instead of 2.0. Lookup pendrivelinux, they have a walkthrough on how to boot from USB.

				I boot a persistent Liberte USB stick on Windows OS in VMware player using the &quot;Plop&quot; bootloader as mentioned above. Yes it states &quot;Warning: non-native environment (vmware)&quot;. I&#039;ve never thought of this as a security risk, in fact booting from USB into a VM is inherently more secure than say, the Tor browser bundle. The USB stick is encrypted too, of course.

				Hey everyone quick question from this. I&#039;m running vmware in win7 and have my liberte linux installed and setup on a usb. i&#039;ve been booting from usb fine and then using ethernet connection because my wireless adapter won&#039;t work. But now running vmware and plop bootloader ive loaded up my liberte from usb using vmware fine and am bridging the connection from the host using the wireless adapter and then it shows up as wired connection inside liberte. Is there any settings i need to check or uncheck in vmware or my computer to be secure?<br /><br />thanks

This gives Liberte an IP on your LAN rather than using the one your host has. I would recommend NATing Liberte and using the wireless on the host if this is your preference. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91828.msg1232622#msg1232622">Quote from: abitpeckish on June 13, 2013, 02:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Running things on a hypervisor is fine, so long as you trust the hypervisor and its administrator(s). <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The hypervisor isn&#039;t the issue. The host OS being compromised is. If you use a GUI on the host (as I assume most do) then an attacker can view every app accessing the GUI as there is no GUI level isolation. This means if you are using Firefox on the host and someone compromises it, they can view all your apps running in the GUI including your VM.
