				There&#039;s a bunch of scattered information about how to get bitcoin, how to move it, and how to cash out. Some of those methods are still valid, while others have stopped working for one reason or another. I thought it would be easier to reference if it was all in one location, with the url, short howto, ID requirements, fees, and current status. <br /><br />Let&#039;s compile something like http://howdoyoubuybitcoins.com/ or https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges but with a focus on anonymous to semi-anonymous methodology. The less information you give out in the process of getting bitcoins, the less likelier it is that anyone could link those bitcoins, transactions on SR, to you and your real identity. If you end up having to give your ID, perhaps during the course of a Mt Gox verification, there are still ways to mix, tumble, and obfuscate those bitcoins so they cannot reasonably be linked to you.<br /><br />If you know more information about any of these or know any other methods not listed that you can vouch for, please contribute. <br />As always, please do your own due diligence before conducting your trasactions. Be wary of scams, especially people dealing with moneypak. Always use escrow when available, and never finalize early. This list is not a 100% thing, and is only to guide you<br /><br /><br />===========<br />Buying bitcoin<br />===========<br />- Bitinstant - https://bitinstant.com/ - Deposit USD Cash at locations like Walmart, CVS, and others. Deposit slip for Moneygram requires name, address and usually isn&#039;t checked. CVS may require ID, depending on regional policy and clerk&#039;s mood. Rate is guaranteed at time of deposit. Combined deposit fee of variable 3.99% (Bitinstant fee) + flat $3.95 (Zipzap fee). No signup required. DELAYS BEING REPORTED upto weeks in time due to high volume of transactions. BEWARE. (April 24, 2013)<br />- Localbitcoins - https://localbitcoins.com/ - Buy &amp; sell with cash in person. Signup required to contact buyers/sellers. Status varies with individual buyer/seller. Take appropriate safety measure when meeting someone in person. (April 24, 2013) Use a guide: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155689<br />- Blue Sky Traders - http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm - Deposit USD Cash at any Bank of America location, no ID or bank account required.

At the time, it &quot;appeared&quot; to be TOR-friendly. What I have since learned in the past couple of weeks is that in fact, Bitstamp is NOT TOR-friendly and WILL flag your account under circumstances where multiples users are logged into Bitstamp with the same TOR-IP. This is unlike Bitfloor, which was PERFECT, since Bitfloor never even monitored that stuff, BUT, Bitstamp DOES. Now, they haven&#039;t started closing accounts as of yet after flagging the account, you simply have to log out, change your IP, and then log back in; HOWEVER, I am concerned that after multiple flags (I have only experience one thus far), you are susceptible to account closure / further investigation. By the way, when Bitstamp flags the account, it does state something along the lines of &quot;your computer&#039;s information/ip/etc has been logged into the console&quot; and that &quot;your IP is associated with criminal activity.&quot; The latter statement makes me believe that Bitstamp may also be flagging certain known TOR IP&#039;s now that have been entered into their database, in addition to unknown IP&#039;s that register multiple users at once. <br /><br />All in all, using Bitstamp.net for us anonymous folks is starting to appear to me as a more problematic prospect than I initially imagined. I apologize if this bursts anybody&#039;s bubble, but the truth is the truth, and since we are all pretty much on the same boat as pioneers to this anonymous game, I figured I&#039;d update you all with my progress. <br /><br />Infinite Love,<br />UANDiR1

I&#039;ve done Moneygram transfers via CVS and they didn&#039;t ID me. Maybe its a regional policy or depends on the clerks? Bitinstant works when it works, but when it doesn&#039;t expect to be stuck in support ticket systems for weeks. That was before the April 10 rush though. Maybe it&#039;s changed now and is more reliable?<br /><br />And thanks for the headsup on Bitcopia. Adding all that to the post now<br />

				BitInstant at CVS does not require an ID. These are clerks who don&#039;t know the rules. Tell them you&#039;ve never had to use an ID before and you don&#039;t have it handy and they will usually continue to transaction. If not, just go to the next CVS.<br /><br />Having said that, I personally think BlueSkyTraders is a great option. Totally anonymous.

				Forgive my (probable) ignorance as I&#039;m rather new to this, but would a service such as the one by Sugarmama be the safest way to get bitcoins into you SR account, purely in terms of anonymity?

Compare this to bitinstant: 3.99 flat fee + 3.99% fee if you use their moneygram options. Then compare this to what Bitfloor used to be: no flat fee, somewhere under 2-3% on deposit + miniscule trading fees to convert.

Kind of like using your girlfriend as proxy: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151746.0 but on a bigger scale and with random people on the street. That way they know little about what&#039;s going on and have very little information on you to squeal about. Not only do you get anonymous bitcoins, you could use all these new bitcoins to feed a bitcoin laundering service to wash dirty bitcoins too. A lot is possible with this kind of service.<br /><br />As far as risk to the smurf goes, why would they trust some site asking to transfer bitcoins to them (since btc transactions are irreversible). You would be asking them to trust that they will get their money + profit back after the btc transaction. In their eyes, you could just run away with the bitcoins. Either you setup your own escrow service, use a third party escrow, or front the money + profit. All of those are bad ideas except setting up your own escrow, as an additional cost.<br /><br />My question is how would you pay the smurfs once they transfer the bitcoins to you? Does that need to be anonymous? Why or why not?

				Cryptocurrent is suspended? The website, updated April 24, says they are doing business with previous customers, but I have yet to hear back on my latest email. This is by far the longest it&#039;s taken CC to reply. Does anybody know what&#039;s up? Are there any other similarly anonymous and hassle-free ways to obtain BTC? Thanks.
