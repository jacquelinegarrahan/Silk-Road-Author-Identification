				&nbsp;What are the security risks of using onion.to??<br /><br />From what I understand, if you connect to SR using onion.to you go through the clearnet website onion.to and then directed from there back into TOR. So, if onion.to was working with the Feds they could deanonymize you right?<br /><br />I went to their website to do a little research but there is very little information on how it affects your anonymity.<br /><br />Can someone please explain how onion.to works?

				What you say pretty much sums it up. Do NOT use it, it bypasses all mechanisms that make Tor safe; it completely kills your anonymity.&nbsp;

That&#039;s weird. I&#039;m not going to try it, but that would either mean that<br /><br />a) Your Tor browser isn&#039;t working properly<br />or<br />b) It&#039;s not the actual SR site they show you, but a &quot;mirror&quot; of it. A phising site if you like, designed to steal your SR login and then your BitCoin. <br /><br />Also a possibility I wouldn&#039;t rule out.

				its not a phishing site because i tried bogus logins and it didn&#039;t let me in. then i tried a legitimate login and it worked.&nbsp; also, you can use onion.to to connect to any .onion site through your normal web browser.&nbsp; It seems very likely that it&#039;s run by the feds

				&nbsp;I connect to a VPN before Tor as well, and set up a premium server in another country.
