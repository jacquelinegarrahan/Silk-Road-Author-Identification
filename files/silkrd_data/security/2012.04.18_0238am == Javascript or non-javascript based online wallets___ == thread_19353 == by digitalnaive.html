				Hi to all the SilkRoaders!<br />I can&#039;t say I&#039;m new to SR,be cause I discovered it last October, but I wanted to be ok with all the computer security stuff before placing an order (and because I&#039;m not in a hurry), and I&#039;m closed to have learned all what I was in need to go on.<br />But I still have a few questions about e-wallets, that lots of buyers here like to use to tumbler or wash their Bitcoins before funding their SR account.<br />I read lots of things on Bitcoins, and of course, I&#039;ve been through the bitcoin wiki:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page<br /><br />Here is what retained my attention on the page dedicated to e-wallets (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/EWallet) :<br /><br />- For non-javascript e-wallets:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;If a payment is made from an online wallet, the transaction&#039;s &quot;from&quot; address is an address for the wallet provider and not an address reserved specifically for the sender. This is because the wallet service provider may service the payment from any coins in its possession - your balance is not associated with any particular coins, any more than your balance at your local bank is associated with any specific bills. Thus if the recipient were to &quot;return&quot; any bitcoins to the same address they were sent from, the sender would not receive those bitcoins.&quot;<br />&quot;Transactions to a Bitcoin address from the same wallet provider are usually completed internally and, if so, will not be processed on the Bitcoin P2P network. Auditing tools such as the Block Explorer will not show any activity for this transaction.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />- For javascript e-wallets:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Javascript based e-wallets differ from traditional online wallet services because the user actually owns the private keys inside their wallet. This approach has several advantages:<br />The &quot;from&quot; address of a transaction originates from the actual bitcoin address of the user.<br />The user can lookup their account balance in the blockchain and which guarantees their account balance is correct. &quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, if I got it, that should mean that by transfering your funds to a non-javascript e-wallet provider just after the exchange platform, you cand send it directly to your SR account, because 1) it&#039;s sent from the bitcoin adress of the provider, not from one linked with you, and 2) the coins sent are coins from any users of the e-wallet providers, not necessarily yours.<br /><br />OK, so now, my questions:<br />1) Do you also understand the same thing as me when you read what I post?<br />2) If you have good notions in Bitcoin e-wallets, can you confim or invalidate my understanding?<br />3) As of April 2012, are those informations from the bitcoin wiki still true??<br />4) Do you know a few reliable non-javascript e-wallet providers to advise?<br /><br />I think that this method to fund an SR account could be really time-saving if the above assertions are verified.<br /><br />F..k, I&#039;ve just re-read my post, and it seems really boring, I will put a few smileys to make you relax in order to answer to my questions:<br />&nbsp;;D :o 8) ::) :P :-*<br /><br />Anyway, have a good day, and many thanks in advance for your answer!&nbsp; ;)

				Hi kmfkewm,<br />Yeah, you&#039;re right, sorry for my confusion... Shame on me!<br />I will rectify the title of the topic.<br /><br />Anyway, the assertion in the Bitcoin wiki was about Javascript based online e-wallets.
