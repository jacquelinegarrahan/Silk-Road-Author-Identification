				I provided a Custom Order for a 60btc purchase for wanksta2012 and despite next day delivery on Friday the 12th (express so I have the tracking details along with Auspost delivery confirmation) he finally messages me at 1am on a Sunday saying &#039;hey I didnt get the package can you check the tracking&#039;. The package was MDMA.... Um maybe he was rolling from Friday arvo until then and now does not want to pay for yesterdays drugs. I promised him he would have it by close of business Friday and Auspost confirms it. Now he wont release my hard earned 60 btc, its all I have left.<br />&nbsp;Ive sent him a message explaining that if he was concerned about non delivery he would have messaged me after cob Friday, Ive also pointed out that the 1am Sunday morning message tells me he was rolling all weekend. Finally Ive cut and pasted the express delivery confirmation confirming it was posted and sent it to him.<br />&nbsp;I took so many risks and I worked so hard, was just getting back on my feet... then this! Its the second time Ive been scammed. Sorry for venting folks but for a small vendor who prides himself on customer service and stocking the best product possible Im losing faith in this SR thing.

				Has he put it into resolution? If not, you may just have to wait for it to auto-finalize.<br /><br />In resolution, give the tracking number to SR staff. I am sure you will get all your bitcoin, it will just take time.

				See if you can come to a resolution with them before it goes to resolution. Tracking doesn&#039;t mean shit and depending on their buying stats on Silk Road the best you might get is a 50/50 split

				We are not in resolution yet, a bit early. His stats are goodish , no refunds just lots of orders and not much spent.. Think he had been waiting for a score like this. <br /><br />Been no contact on his part since Sunday morning at 1am to say it had not arrived on Friday. The thing is Australia post dont deliver on weekends. I sent express post Thursday so he could get it Friday (as we agreed). The tracking shows that it was delivered to him on Friday. He rolled on my 60BTC worth of molly from Friday until Sunday then decided not to finalize and to tell me it didnt arrive 48hrs earlier. Make any sense to anyone why he wouldnt have contacted me Friday evening to say it had not arrived as Id promised? Anyone else think he was rolling from Fri until Sunday on my mdma?<br /><br />My very last btc in the world guys. I really love this place but this is the 2nd time Ive been ripped. First time was my fault as I was green and stupid. Then I pulled myself up to start from scratch and was finally making headway. Thing is this guy lives within a reasonably short driving distance and while Ive destroyed his address Its still stuck in my head. I just wish it was a IRL deal and we could sort it out. Ive never done a drug rip in my life, a man needs a code. <br /><br />Chances are I will lose my vendor account as at the height of my anger I at the very least implied threats, asking him to put the kettle on and to expect me for coffee etc... Stupid I know! Its just when your 100% sure someone is lying and have stolen from you,...well I saw red, still do.&nbsp; From my discussions with others despite my tracking evidence the benefit of the doubt ends up with the buyer despite my 100% rating. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Well time to stop whinging and man up, another lesson learned. Back to the grind, may need to call in some favours to make it happen. <br /><br />Karma is a funny thing wanksta2012&nbsp; 8) <br />

				True Napper,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Auspost Express do actually bother with tracking if they say its &#039;delivered&#039;,&nbsp; 100% of the time in my experience it is. This comes from my previous ebay life sending 30 plus express post items daily for years on end. The majority of buyers are honest, I love my few true regulars. I&#039;ll have stock soon fellas, somehow.
