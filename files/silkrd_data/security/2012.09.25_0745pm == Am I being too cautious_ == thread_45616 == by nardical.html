				I&#039;ve read a lot of recommendations here for Liberte Linux, and I&#039;ve successfully gotten it up and running, but my router isn&#039;t compatible with it, so I can&#039;t reach the internet.<br /><br />If I kept my SR purchases to say, small amounts of cannabis for personal use, would I even need to run Liberte?<br /><br />Is running Tor, anonymizing my Bitcoin purchases, and encrypting my hard drive enough?<br /><br />Or should I go and buy a new router?<br /><br />Thank you!

				I think it&#039;s a personal preference of how paranoid you are... Set up sounds fine for small purchases and already more than some people do.

				I&#039;m extremely paranoid, but also sick and desperate. I guess I&#039;ll just go for it.<br /><br />Thanks.

				too paranoid doesn&#039;t exist. where would the tinfoil industry be without people like us?<br /><br />but surely there is support for your router (not OOB, but attainable) in liberty. I am not sure what flavor of linux it is build on, but there are plenty of people who could help with getting it to work for you. kmfkewm comes to mind, as does shannon

				You&#039;re right, it&#039;s better safe than sorry.<br /><br />I&#039;ll do some more research, ask around a bit more.<br /><br />Thanks.

				No such thing as being &quot;too cautious&quot;, but for the most part you don&#039;t really have to go through all the extra motions.&nbsp; The real point of error is always going to be where the package is intercepted, which can happen no matter how many 100&#039;s of proxies you are going through, no matter how many bridges you&#039;re using, no matter how many times you encrypt your hard drive...if LE wants to bust down your door over 100mg of cocaine they&#039;re gonna do it.<br /><br />That said, I think it&#039;s a wee bit overkill but if it puts your mind at ease go for it.&nbsp; A friend of mine has ordered -easily- 50 times from SR and the only real safety precautions he takes is PGP for posting his address on a purchase.
