				A seller like SuperTrips for example sells around 1000BTC a day, how can he/she/they turn that much BTC into cash without arousing suspicion of LE? There must be a system that they are using because that is some serious cash!

				I heard someone on a private board is working on a BTC to cash drive for your computer. it is much like an ATM, but it is installed in place of your existing DVD drive. then you send the bitcoins to this address: 1WretchedkowQPrsrVnpz2m4SdSQhQpZuc (Disclaimer: that is a fabricated address)<br />, and less than an hour later, your cash is ready
