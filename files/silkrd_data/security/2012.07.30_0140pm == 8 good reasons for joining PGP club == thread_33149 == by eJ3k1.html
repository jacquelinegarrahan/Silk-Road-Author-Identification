				There are many good reasons for joining the Silk Road&#039;s PGP club. Here are 8 of them.<br /><br />When you join the club, you:<br />- Will have a good time chatting with fellow members<br />- Learn about encryption. Even if you&#039;re completely new to it, or a total technophobe, a team of members will gladly help you with any questions<br />- You don&#039;t have to pay anything, it&#039;s completely free! Where else do you see that?<br />- Increase your confidence and savoir-vivre here in the deep web<br />- Earn positive karma for successfully participating and helping others<br />- Get a higher post count and become a full member faster (don&#039;t tell the mods)<br />- Become a member of an anonymous deep web secret society. How cool is that?<br /><br />And most important:<br />- You learn to use GPG encryption. A life-saving skill that will help you avoid big problems if something ever happens to the TOR network. It&#039;s much easier than you might think!<br /><br />Join the revolution! Learn GPG or Die!<br /><br />C U @ dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0

				I use igolder.com/pgp its a great freeware tool that makes it super easy to encrypt and decrypt messages. its also a. key generator . It is a crutch though, as sometimes the site is down for a day when I need to encrypt and knowing how to do it manually would be great knowledge. <br />

Having a third party do the encryption for you, doesn&#039;t sound like a great idea to me. At least not for things like this.

				FYI, we flew past 130 members yesterday and the number is apparently increasing exponentially judging from the 50 PMs I still haven&#039;t shifted, I guesstimate it&#039;s 150 members to date.<br /><br />Edit: That&#039;s not counting anybody who learned from PGP Club but didn&#039;t PM me or post to myself on the thread.

				150 members? :o Holy pi√±ata!<br /><br />I honestly believe that well used GPG is as effective as a loaded AK47. So with 150 men, we&#039;re like a big friggin&#039; cartel.<br /><br />WE ARE the monster. Hear us ROARR!!!
