				I thought I&#039;d share with you a set of rules to create a strong and different password for EVERY SINGLE site that you visit without having to write it down or remember it although they are all complex!&nbsp; I&#039;ll explain with an example at the end.<br /><br />Substitutions:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">a = @<br />e = 3<br />i = 1 (one)<br />o = 0 (zero)<br />s = $<br /></code><br />Create a pin code for yourself; an even number usually works best.&nbsp; A pin number that you can remember!&nbsp; For example, 1234 is a 4-digit pin number that we&#039;ll use (you can use a longer one if you&#039;d like). <br /><br />Now the general algorithm for the password is (and I&#039;ll explain):<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">1/2 Pin Number + Site Name (w/ Substitutions - first letter is capitalized and void of substitutions) + Special Charcter (I use ! ) + 1/2 Pin Number<br /></code><br />With that we have our example pin number: 1234<br />Our exmple site is Facebook.com<br />Thus, the password would be: 12F@c3b00k!34<br /><br />So it&#039;s a seemingly complicated password to others, harder to crack, and easy for you to remember!<br /><br />Let&#039;s break down what happened.&nbsp; We used the first two digits of our pin: 1234.&nbsp; The site name is Facebook and if &#039;F&#039; had a substitution you wouldn&#039;t use it here because you want at least one capital letter, one lower case letter, one number (our pin number), and special character - this encompasses them all!&nbsp; So we use Facebook with our above substitutions.&nbsp; At the end you append a special character (I like to use an exclamation point - personal preference).&nbsp; Then we append the last half our pin: 1234.<br /><br />So more examples of this would be:<br />12G00gl3!34 - for Google<br />12Tw1tt3r!34 - for Twitter<br />12P1nt3r3$t!34 - for Pinterest<br /><br />See how I don&#039;t have to remember them.&nbsp; But you DON&#039;T have to use the site name.&nbsp; The beauty with this is you can use anything and even write it down without worrying about a friend finding it and cracking it.&nbsp; They don&#039;t know your rules (substitutions + pin splitting) and will never figure it out.<br /><br />For example, I might write down &quot;Account&quot; as my password for Facebook.&nbsp; But I still use my pin and substitutions for it.&nbsp; This way you can leave it in plain site and never forget it!

				No offense but those passwords will all be cracked in no time at all. Your best bet is to remember two really good passwords, one for FDE and one for your password manager that handles all others. You really have two options. Option number one is to create a 128 bit (or more, but it gets much harder to remember) truly random password. It will look something like this: ?il+u3iI^jV@geR*mF=r<br /><br />Your next option is to create a really long phrase, if it is plain english following proper |grammatical rules it will need to be 128 characters most likely, but if it is not proper English then you can get away with less.| <br /><br />So roughly everything between the first and last pipe, considering the sentence I typed was proper English.<br /><br />Bad Password: 12G00gl3!34<br />Good Password:&nbsp; ?il+u3iI^jV@geR*mF=r<br />Bad Password: 12P1nt3r3$t!34<br />Good Password: grammatical rules it will need to be 128 characters most likely, but if it is not proper English then you can get away with less.<br />&nbsp;

				128 characters is a lot to remember! Is a 15 character truly random password strong enough? I thought anything over 13 random characters was considered strong. I&#039;ve heard of using 5 or more words and then 8 random characters at the end to make a strong password.

				Here&#039;s a very good password strength estimator I found : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html (requires javascript)<br />Your xkcd was pretty good too, they used it as an example in this password in the link above.

				What is the general consensus for sites like this? https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm <br /><br />I use it for all my passwords to be honest (using Tor Browser of course) I have two 64 character passwords that i can remember... one for my tails persistence and one for the truecrypt container which contains a txt file with all my passwords generated using that site. There is no way i could remember all my passwords especially if they are all 64 characters long. What are your thoughts?

That is not a horrible password, for a long time the minimum entropy of a secure password was considered to be 80 bits, but today estimates are closer to 128 bits. 80 bit passwords are no longer considered to be secure, 85 bit passwords are significantly better but you really should aim for at least 128 bits, which is about 20 random ASCII characters or 128 characters of English text.

				In practice though you can probably get away with slightly less. For one if the application you use the password with is using PBKDF with iterations, it will stretch the bit strength of the password out. A 19 character random ASCII password has 124.83 bits of entropy giving it a key space of 2^124.83 , if there is a PBKDF with 1,000 iterations the number of hash operations required to exhaust the key space will be 2^124.83 * 1,000 and log2(2^124.83 * 1,000) = 134.79 bit equivalency. An 18 character random ASCII password has a key space of 2^118.26 so with 1,000 PBKDF iterations it is log2(2^118.26 * 1,000) = 128.22 bit equivalency. So if you know the application you are entering your password into has 1,000 or more PBKDF iterations you are actually secure with only an 18 random character ASCII password.<br /><br />Also, totally grammatically correct English prose is estimated to have about 1 bit per byte, but if you type things that you would never read in a book (ie: correct horse battery staple) and use special characters and such (ie: cOrrect h0rse batt3ry s!apl3) then the entropy significantly increases over 1 bit per byte, for the first few characters at least, although it levels off to near 1 bit per byte after many characters. So chances are you don&#039;t actually need 128 characters of human readable text, so long as it doesn&#039;t look like something you would write in a letter to somebody. Also the PBKDF will come into play for human readable passwords as well, so in the end you wont need quite 128 characters even if it does look like it is out of a letter or book.
