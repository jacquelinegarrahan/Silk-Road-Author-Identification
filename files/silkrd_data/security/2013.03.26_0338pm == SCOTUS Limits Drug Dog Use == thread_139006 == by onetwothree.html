				I didn&#039;t see this posted anywhere yet.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />(Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday limited the ability of police to use a dog to sniff around the outside of a home for illegal drugs that might be inside.<br /><br />By a 5-4 vote, the court said a government&#039;s use of trained police dogs to investigate a home and its immediate surroundings was a &quot;search&quot; within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.<br /><br />The decision could make it harder for police to use trained dogs to detect drugs without first obtaining warrants.<br /><br />&quot;A police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home and knock, precisely because that is no more than any private citizen might do,&quot; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority.<br /><br />&quot;But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating evidence is something else,&quot; he added. &quot;There is no customary invitation to do that.&quot;<br /><br />The decision upheld a 2011 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court suppressing evidence found outside Joelis Jardines&#039; home by a chocolate Labrador retriever named Franky with a strong record of sniffing out drug stashes.<br /><br />The dog&#039;s handler allowed him to smell near the base of the front door of the home near Miami after receiving an anonymous tip, which proved accurate, that marijuana was growing inside.<br /><br />Gregory Garre, a lawyer who argued Florida&#039;s appeal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Howard Blumberg, who argued Jardines&#039; appeal, also had no immediate comment, saying he had yet to review the decision.

				A great idea for supreme court rulings that have anything to do with our rights or our security or our anonymity, should be a sticky for at least 30 days so that vendors and customers alike can run their operations accordingly.<br /><br />This is good stuff!<br /><br />Great drop OP.

				I always sprinkle chlorine powder all over the floor of the car.&nbsp; Yu can&#039;t smell it but if a dog sniffs it, it burns horribly in the nostrils.&nbsp; Enough to render the dogs nose useless for a few weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Get the powdered chlorine at pool and hot tub stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;I got the idea after sprinkling powdered chlorine on my garbage bags <br />outside to prevent dogs from eating my garbage.&nbsp; It worked great!! Dogs can&#039;t go near the stuff and the more they try the more they yelp and yelp! <br /><br /><br />Damn dogs&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not cruel to animals but I am defensive to anyone or anything that threatens my freedom .including trained cop dogs.&nbsp; <br />
