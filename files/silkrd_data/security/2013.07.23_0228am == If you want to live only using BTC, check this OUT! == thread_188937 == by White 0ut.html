				This kind of seems shady. While it is cool they accept bitcoins, it still isn&#039;t anonymous. When you&#039;re installing an app on your android phone, so much is connected to you (unless you have a burner). They can get your number, contact, etc. It also seems like a setup because when I went to go visit it in TOR browser, it says &quot;This app does not support private browsing. Please turn it off and try again.&quot;<br /><br />That being said, it does seem like a cool concept, but I wouldn&#039;t install an app on my phone and then keep my fingers crossed that I&#039;ll stay anonymous.

				$2000 Amazon gift card looks pretty sweet. You can buy just about anything there. I couldn&#039;t find anything about fees/exchange rates though.

				I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;d want to buy giftcards, and less from such corporations, to live using only BTC, personally I&#039;d buy money instead. But for anyone else who wants this seems to be a neat site.

				Thanks White out, <br />I saw that you had posted that, but assume there is a price break at a certain point. Hopefully the $2K Amazon card would be a better deal. But I guess 4% isn&#039;t bad anyway.

				It turns out there ARE stamps for sale on Amazon. But I only saw collectibles or regular &quot;forever&quot; stamps for 1oz letters. Looks like they are being resold by people who go to the&nbsp; post office and buy it for resale. <br />You might be able to talk an individual seller into stocking something special for you to order regularly. <br />You&#039;ll pay quite a premium though. But then again, if you find a trusted seller, and prepay for a large number of bigger stamps, you might negotiate a pretty good deal.<br />
