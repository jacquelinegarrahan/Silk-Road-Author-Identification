Tor only encrypts your traffic inside the Tor network.

Tor does not defend against these types of potential attacks, especially when using a public Wi-Fi like that at McDonalds. Basically, until you join the Tor network, your traffic can be monitored. This would only be an issue if you come under the watchful eye of LE but still worth noting.

				Yes, you can either use openGp a PGP GUI, or if your I device is jail broken, you can use command line GPG which is included as a cydia utility. I posted on how to use the command line, you will need ifile and mobile terminal emulator. Can&#039;t be bothered trawling back through my posts to find it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The JavaScript vulnerability is true, but as above you can lock off your GPS with a pass code. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would like someone with genuine knowledge to describe the specific risks, I am not denying that a I device is less secure than liberte or tails, but I would like more information.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever the subject of using iOS or android&nbsp; is broached there is a lot of FUD about LE following you back through Tor and switching your GPS and camera and mic on. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d like someone with the required knowledge to describe the actual risks to lay this subject to rest so we can decide for ourselves.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How much of a concern is the inability to disable JavaScript? (On orbot theandroid Tor client, you CAN do this, it is generally much more sophisticated than onion browser) If one was only using it to visit SR through the correct URL?

				Yeah I would probably agree that iOS is probably totally insecure; I&#039;m interested to see if android can be user securely. Its basically a Linux operating system, and recently a dev called Tassander has made a grub like boot loader for android that allows you to boot into different ROMs and even Linux distros on an android tablet. You can also boot from USB, and I&#039;m wondering if liberte can be made to run on it? All that needs to be done is to zip the ROM into a template that the dev provides but its a bit beyond me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be great if someone could get this running<br /><br />Links:<br /><br />https://github.com/Tasssadar/multirom/wiki<br /><br />http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2093797<br /><br />

				This has been discussed many, many time before. If you do some digging, I seem to recall many of the tech minded members agreeing with the fact that using a mobile device (phone, tablet, etc) is NOT safe at this point in time. There was even a response from SR Support stating that you should avoid using any mobile device to access SR (this can be found in a previous thread in response to another member&#039;s query to SR Support Staff). Of course, this is all&nbsp; based on the assumption that you&#039;re under the watchful eye of LE, but I personally would avoid using any mobile device when the software development is still in it&#039;s infancy. The mobile phone is the one thing which brings down most drug suspects when being watched. Until there is further development and proven methods on counteracting current and future attacks, I won&#039;t be using one, if at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

Until there is further development and proven methods on counteracting current and future attacks, I won&#039;t be using one, if at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks, Wadozo. Couldn&#039;t have said it better myself. +1!
