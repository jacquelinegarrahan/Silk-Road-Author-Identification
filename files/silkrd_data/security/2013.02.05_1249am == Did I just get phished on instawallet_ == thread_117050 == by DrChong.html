				So I do the usual routine of transferring btc to instawallet before going through the SR tumbler, and the first wallet goes through fine, but somehow I lost my coins for the second wallet? You see, the url address for wallet #2 is correct, but the receiving address differs on the wallet from what I copy pasted in notepad. What I don&#039;t understand is why there is a different address. Clearly I didn&#039;t just pull an address out of thin air, so how come now the receiving address posted in the wallet is not the same as the address that I posted underneath the *correct* URL of the wallet? My only explanation is that I got phished, because the wallet has no coin in it (and on blockchain explorer it shows the transfer of the exact amount of bitcoin), although I had only transferred the contents of the first wallet so far.<br /><br />Any alternative ideas?<br /><br />Luckily I only lost a little under $40 here, but considering I&#039;m on a tight budget that&#039;s not much of a relief. Think I&#039;m gonna stop using instawallet from now on..not worth the hassle.

				Hence the reason I would never use a Web based Client such as Instawallet. Try using a Desktop Client instead such as Bitcoin-Qt with Armory installed on top for added security.

				Damn instawallet.<br /><br />Ya, always use the desktop client wallet instead.&nbsp; These online wallets are to risky to loose something in transit or, dropped connection, webpage errors and such.&nbsp; there is so much to go wrong. . . yikes.<br /><br />As Wadozo says, use a wallet client app (they are free) you can much more control over your transactions too.&nbsp; You can set the transaction fee to a higher amount and get faster transactions for example.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, it keeps track of your transactions which could be good and bad.&nbsp; Like Wadozo says, use armoury to protect your papertrail, if you choose to keep one.&nbsp; I always delete everything in my client wallet after each transaction, so if someone gets into it there is nothing to show or any log files.<br /><br />There is little you can do to get your money back unless you know the bitcoin address URL for the instawallets used.&nbsp; As the site says, if you loose or screw up this address , you loose its contents.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you do use an online wallet,&nbsp; - pick one that offers a login and password / account.&nbsp; This way, you can see what went wrong and get some support.<br /><br />My bitcoin exchange (http://www.cavirtex.com)&nbsp; offers a login/account and wallet all in one.&nbsp; You can buy coins, transfer money from your bank account to buy/sell coins instantly.&nbsp; Its one site/login for everything.&nbsp; I know its not anonymous, but there isn&#039;t anything illegal about buying bitcoins from your bank account.&nbsp; Pass them through a few wallets and off to SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its not an issue unless you are trading over $1000. /day .&nbsp; Then you need anonymous services and laundering.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />

				The thing with all this jiggery pokey of transferring through multiple wallets and mixers is this:<br /><br />Either you bought your bitcoins anonymously, in which case you can transfer them straight to SR without a backwards glance<br /><br />OR<br />&nbsp; <br />You bought them via bank transfer or other traceable method, in which case no matter how much trail hiding you attempt; when LE find 3000 MDMA pills in your letterbox, the fact you bought bitcoins is going to be additional circumstantial evidence.<br /><br />But if you are only talking $40 worth of business then I&#039;d just transfer em straight to SR. I personally used instawallets for small amounts many times with no problems. Just don&#039;t use the same one more than once as that kind of defeats the object.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway sorry for your loss, it&#039;s still annoying even if it&#039;s a small amount. If you are sure you didn&#039;t fuck up in some way i guess you must have been phished.

				Well if you can buy it for cash anonymously and it has a tracking number then I suppose it can be proved that a particular person caught on camera at specific time bought it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d like to add I&#039;m not an expert on Internet security; while browsing this forum I&#039;m often painfully reminded of how little I know. All I&#039;m offering here is my personal opinion.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in our hypothetical case of drugs found addressed to you; I guess it very much depends on the amount. I mean LE would have to check the cameras at all money order vendors near you for several weeks to get a photo. And does a money order have plenty of legitimate uses? If you can use said money order to buy bitcoins anonymously I don&#039;t see how they could be linked to you .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other point I was making is just that, having had a package intercepted, if it can be shown you bought bitcoins it is additional circumstantial evidence, however much you mix the coins thereafter.<br />
