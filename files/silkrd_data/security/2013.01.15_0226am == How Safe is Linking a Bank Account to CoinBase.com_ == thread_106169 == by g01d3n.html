				Hello, I&#039;m fairly new here and I was wondering how safe is it to link a bank account to my CoinBase account (or any bitcoin place for that matter). I linked my bank account to my CoinBase account last week, and I get my bitcoins tomorrow (bank had to verify for a few days). Is this a safe technique? After I get my coins will tumbling them to a Mtgox account, then to my SR account be viable; or shouls I immediatel unlink my bank account when I get my bitcoins?<br /><br />Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time.

				I was curious about this as well. Did anyone ever give you input? How risky would it be to go strait from coinbase to the road? Seems to me it wouldn&#039;t be a big deal if you aren&#039;t keeping stuff at the address associated with the bank account.

				Hey - if OP is still around - give us a review on how Coinbase works/worked for you. Does it take 5 days for each transfer, or just the first. Inquiring minds want to know. There&#039;s lots of chatter on this board about bitinstant, etc., but I don&#039;t hear much about Coinbase.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a wide range of opinion on the issue of security in moving coins. I figure, for a normal user, sending the coins into and out of SR with a pass through Bitfog is a pretty decent way to do it and I can&#039;t see LE bothering to unwind that kind of transaction for anything other than some big major target. Just my opinion.

				Wow I just checked the coinbase.com website and their step by step instructions look super easy and straight forward. I am also curious as to the turnaround time it takes to get your coins. <br />Anyone wanna chime in with a review of coinbase.com ?

I don&#039;t think it cost much, but&nbsp; forget the number. I transfer my coins from a legal wallet somewhere else to bitfog and leave it in there for about a half day before sending them on to SR. transfers seem pretty fast - you do need to wait for the 6 confirmations, and the entry time into SR can be more or less depending on how crazy the bitcoin market is.. <br /><br />I liked the process, but not do any security analysis on it. I trust that the bitfog process at least mostly obscures things and would make it prohibitively resource intensive and expensive for LE to prove so I don&#039;t worry there. Others may have their own opinion.

				I use Coinbase. The 4 day process period hasn&#039;t ever been a problem with me because I like to take my time with my purchases. However, Coinbase has had a lot of glitches in the past, but I haven&#039;t seen any in the last couple weeks. Hopefully they&#039;re finally figuring it out...... I have been using it for about 3 months now. Once my coin is processed in Coinbase I send it straight to my Blockchain wallet, which is where I keep it until I&#039;m ready to buy some goodies. <br /><br />One thing I would like to note is that Coinbase has a limited amount of coins it can sell a day, so the best time to buy them are in the morning. A couple times I have tried making a bitcoin purchase and it says they have exceeded their daily limit. This can be pretty annoying, but I just try again in the morning and it usually works. <br /><br />It&#039;s definitely not for everyone, but for me it works just fine.

				Thanks uhohoreo - do you pay pretty close to market price for your coins? The delay is only in getting money into Coinbase, correct? I assume that transfers of bitcoin out are fast?

And yes, the only delay is for your coins to become available for your use. I paid $186 for 2 bitcoins last week, and just received them yesterday, and now those bitcoins are worth over $300 in my Coinbase wallet. To answer your question, yes, transfers out of Coinbase are pretty quick. I haven&#039;t had any issues with this. Good luck !

				So I guess it was a bad idea to send 10 BTC from coinbase to the road. . .

Tumble your coin through some other wallets before sending it to SR
