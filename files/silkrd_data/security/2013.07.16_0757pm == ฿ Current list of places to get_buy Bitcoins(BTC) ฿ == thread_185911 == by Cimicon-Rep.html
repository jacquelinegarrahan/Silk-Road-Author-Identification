				Some people on the SR subreddit have been talking about a site thats called something like cashintobitcoins.com. <br /><br />Seems to have positive reviews from them. But they&#039;re usually a bunch of asshats. So who knows.

				There&#039;s a vendor named &#039;bitcoins&#039; seems legit...<br /><br />Is your list for USA and are they instant with (anonymous) cash deposits? <br /><br /><br />RX king has trusted feedback and forum presence i doubt scam rumours are true.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I used localbitcoins.com for the first time and couldn&#039;t be happier. I found a user with a great rating who was selling Btc via BOA cash deposit.&nbsp; The amount of coin that showed up in my SR account a few hours later was exactly what I had deposited in cash. Yes that&#039;s right, I lost nothing on the transaction due to what I paid for btc and what SR valued it at. I&#039;m not certain if I&#039;ll be able to score that kind of deal every time, but so far thats the best transaction with btc I&#039;ve had. Dude was fast in his responses and quick to release the btc. One downfall is that the site gives you 90 minutes to complete the transaction ( deposit at BOA ) or it will cancel. I managed to make my deposit with only a couple minutes to spare, and when I logged on with my phone to mark order as complete, it said I missed the deadline. So I emailed vender and told him the situation and I asked if I was out my money. he said no worries it&#039;s all set and I had my coins shortly after. <br />&nbsp; I was very skeptical of this site at first, but after spending a couple weeks trying to find new options for BTC, dam if I don&#039;t feel 100% satisfied with the outcome.

				Moneypaktrader.com worked for me! Took a little longer than i expected to hit my wallet. When the transaction was done it took like 12 hrs to hit my wallet. I was getting a little nervous when the transaction was closed but i still had no coin. <br /><br />But of course the value of coin dropped a bit before i sold my MP, leaving me .4 short on my order. Ah, i was patient before I can be patient again..

				subbed<br />and also I&#039;d like to second localbitcoins.com. Used it for the first time and it was such a smooth process. I used the bank deposit method, had my coins from the point I created an account to the point they were in my wallet in 2 hours.<br /><br />The website allows sellers to set a limit on how many BTCs users can buy at a time based on your purchasing history. Many sellers who offered bank deposits for BTC close to the market price only allowed me to purchase 1 or 2 BTCs. So, I found a seller who had a high markup (almost 20% over market price) but he didn&#039;t limit how many BTCs I could buy. It was a steep price, but...<br /><br />the good things is, with that one time purchase of several bitcoins at a premium price, I looked back at the sellers who were selling close to market price and because I have a bit of reputation now with that once purchase, I can now buy up to about 10 BTCs from the sellers who are selling close to market price. I&#039;m sure that limit will go up the more I purchase, but I doubt I would need more than 10 anyways.<br /><br />I also like the site because it&#039;s very well coded and user friendly, tor-friendly, and you don&#039;t have to provide any personal info. Plus, the price you see from the seller is what you pay, no other fees.<br /><br />&nbsp;Why did I ever use bitinstant?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />

				For UK BTC hunters Bitstamp seems to be 1 of the best options. You can do an EU wide transfer in Euros, which BS convert to Dollars. You then use the dollars in your account to buy BTC from the market, at the lowest price available at the time, and hey presto, you have BTC, which can then be transferred wherever you want!! Trouble is for me, they introduced e-mail verification, and I&#039;d registered a disposable, now deleted e-mail address. That meant I had to go through the arduous process of verifying with them, just to avoid the rather large investment i&#039;d just made being lost&nbsp; :(<br />So although I&#039;ve had good experiences with them i&#039;m now officially verified, which instantly takes away one layer of anonymity!!&nbsp; ::)

				Thanks. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mind if a mod takes the content of the first post and uses it to make a new post. It&#039;s a community resource making it public domain IMO. <br /><br />But I think a separate section would be even better than a thread. This way we can have threads about specific Bitcoin exchangers. Would be easier to keep up with the latest places, methods, issues, scams, etc. <br /><br />I always thought it was weird to lump Bitcoin discussions in with security issues. I get that Bitcoins being anonymous has to do with security issues and whatnot. But with all the regulations and attempts to de-anonymize users of bitcoins at the purchasing/selling point, we need a section to communicate and discuss all these issues. I&#039;d also risk advising that newbies be able to access a bitcoin section. Yes, the stinkin&#039; bitcoin scam spammers will try to flood it. But I&#039;m thinking that it would be a worthless effort on their part because there would be threads and guides about where and how to get bitcoins legitimately. <br /><br />Anyway, I guess petitioning the mods or admins to make a new BTC section is the way to go. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: created a thread in the feature request section to stand as a petition: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188287.msg1362358#msg1362358<br /><br />Post in it and let your opinions lend weight.

				Jumbomonkeybiscuit- needs to be added. great bit coin vendor. I was wonder about bitcoinmerchant they are backed by vendor gotsitall.I love gotsitall H an he seem like a nice guy an great vendor but have not used bitcoinmerchant which it says he backs them up. I just bought a reloadit card an now that im back jumbomonkeybiscuit only has cash listings.Can someone point me in the right direction of a good vendor that takes reloadits an gives bitcoins LOL......Money honey looks legit but you never know an I was ripped of 1 time an I never want that to happen again. If no one comes up with anything I guess I will wait on jumbomonkeybiscuit to have reloadits again. I hate taking the chance since SR dont cover bit coins.&nbsp;

				Ive gotta coin from NoLuv22. MoneyPak only 5% fee because I Was over $1000. 6% under $1000.&nbsp; He only took like 3hours on 3 transactions. His main trade is drugs so he doesn&#039;t always sell but you can&#039;t beat his rate and speed. Doesn&#039;t have a ton of reviews because like I said, he isn&#039;t always trading. Check daily or PM<br /><br />Did 1 transaction with Cryptokeeper. he charges 7% on a moneypak. Coins were in my wallet within an hour. He has tons of reviews of happy customers. <br /><br />Maybe if someone can vouch on these vendors we can certify them. I don&#039;t see any bad reviews for either. <br /><br /><br />

				I would be careful who you add to the list or who you have on there.<br /><br />Some of the vendors you have on the list have been a vendor for a month or less!!!! <br /><br />I am not saying any of them are scammers....BUT it is not like they are trusted vendors either.<br /><br />Every vendor has to start from somewhere, I get that...but the facts are until a vendor has over 300 transactions and has perfect feedback...they are not to be trusted. PERIOD. (even then it is tough)<br /><br />You have already had to remove one vendor from this list...

				@RX King<br /><br />You&#039;re right brother. I noticed freemoney dropped to the 70&#039;s stating it was due to the change in feedback weighting algorithm. But that&#039;s a pretty big drop as a result of old feedback. His current feedback (month&#039;s worth) has been good. <br /><br />Not for nothing, but buyers also have to do their own due diligence. As far as I can tell, it&#039;s mostly an FE transaction. So long term trusted vendors can cut and run in a heartbeat just as fast as a new vendor who gets past the 6 week mark and gets their vendor bond returned. Though, perhaps vendors who also vend product may be more reliable since they may be using fiat&gt;BTC as a means of conversion for themselves as compared to vendors that only do fiat&gt;BTC. It&#039;s a low margin transaction, so yeah, the vendors that only do fiat&gt;BTC having over 300 transactions would seem the better to risk one&#039;s money with. <br /><br />&nbsp;Dealing with companies is not much different in terms of risk. Off the top of my head, a company that went by the name get-bitcoins.com went bust taking client cash with them on the way out. But there were signs and issues towards the end. Bitintsant and MtGox have been a PITA recently (with BitIntsant on hiatus currently). <br /><br />I look at the list as a community resource. Meaning anyone can contribute and vetting is done by the community. I read the posts in the thread to see if there are any requests for additions or subtractions. Some have PM&#039;d me with reviews, warnings and requests to be added. <br /><br />It would be great if we had a separate BTC section where all this information could be centralized and organized better. But in the mean time, like Marines, we just make do.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Fantastic thread! I sure wish something like this had existed when I first found The Road!<br /><br />I&#039;ve used both LocalBitCoins and CoinBase with good results. LBC is fast and reliable. You can usually either find a seller that accepts local bank deposit (very anonymous), or you can pay a seller by PayPal/Credit Card and have your BTC in mere minutes... but when BitCoin is down sellers tend to over-value their BTC, sometimes 15-20% over-valued.<br /><br />That&#039;s where CoinBase comes in. CoinBase is NOT anonymous. The ONLY payment option is to suck money directly from your bank account. They&#039;re also not fast, with an average 4-5 business day wait for your BTC. One time I requested BTC late on a Friday and didn&#039;t receive them until a week from the following Monday... that&#039;s 6 business days, and 10 actual days. Not for the impatient, but they stick close to the current market value making them a good place to go when the price is down. They also allow you to purchase up to 10 BTC a day, even as a new member.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never purchased BTC on Silk Road, and as long as there&#039;s no escrow service for BTC transactions, I never will. I&#039;ve no doubt that there are wonderful and trust-worthy BTC vendors on The Road, but I already have trouble trusting the people I DO know... much less the people I DON&#039;T know. I find the lack of assurity troubling, to say the least. No thanks.<br />It&#039;d be great if SR had a BTC escrow system like LocalBitCoins, but that&#039;d probably open a whole new ball of wax for SR. I&#039;ve seen someone dump over 18,000 BTC on an open exchange like MtGox (worth well over $100 a coin at the time), so I could only imagine the size of some of the transactions that would be laundered through SR with such a system in place. Great GooglyMoogly.<br /><br />Again, thanx for the much-needed go-to BTC thread! I might have saved myself a couple of days of random research and forum raking had this rather simple resorce been available when I first found SR. Now I&#039;m off to go opinionate in the request thread.<br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188287.msg1362358#msg1362358<br />

				Just tried LocalBitcoin for the first time and it&#039;s fucking great. You don&#039;t have to do local trades in person if you don&#039;t want to. You can just find a seller in the US and do a straight cash deposit to their bank, easy as shit. They also hold the bitcoins in escrow so everything is legit and safe.<br /><br />I just deposited cash and got my coins released in less than an hour, that&#039;s fast as shit. Do it.

				LocalBitcoins is legit. A few vendors on there offer Cash-in-Mail and you end up only losing about&nbsp; 3-6%.&nbsp; The seller puts the coins in escrow right away and then you express ship your cash. 24 hours later you will have your coins. Works like a charm.

				Is there anywhere where you can buy BTC by using Visa credit/debit cards? That&#039;s what I was looking for when I first joined SR, but there seems to be a lack of opportunities for this kind of payment.

I am running off to work for the day, but if nobody finds it by the time I get back I will dig it up and post it. It is on this forum. All you have to do is search his posts. There is a post where I openly call him out on it and ask that he admit it. And he did. Granted in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but he made it clear that he IS the owner of this company which he keeps telling people that he bought from.<br /><br />That may not be fraud, but it sure looks like the perfect foundation for a fraud which is about to occur.<br /><br />His name should be removed from the list. I think the only reason it is on there is because you probably saw his own recommendation of his own company.<br /><br />Perhaps he is legit, and just super eager to earn business...I get that. Yet lying is not the way to go about achieving this.

				All good. <br /><br />Looked on bitcointalk and it seems the business is legit. <br />But, at the same time, I see what you are saying based on the thread you pointed to. <br /><br />Yeah, he lied but I think it was due to paranoia. As in being afraid of being associated with SR while trying to get SR business. But that was a silly mistake on his part. Bitcoins = SR in the eyes of LEO. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know. Unless I get or see more positive reviews, I&#039;ll leave it off the list. It&#039;s not the lying part that gets me. It&#039;s the fear of being associated with SR buyers that bothers me. That makes me think that if the slightest thing went down, real or imagined, he&#039;d pull up stakes and run. A Bitcoin service should be secure enough to not care who does business on it or who might be watching.

				I tried the cash deposit thing with localbitcoins only to find out that when I tried to deposit the cash that the bank was not able to put the reference you are given in localbitcoinson onto the deposit. If there is no reference marked on the deposit then the seller is under no obligation to release the coins, so says the escrow system in localbitcoins anyhow. This is only the case with certain UK banks and not others though I have since found out.

				Hey Cimicon-Rep.....Hope your well....I would suggest that you put NO NEW VENDORS IN HERE that are doing btc sales. The fact is they need to be here for at least 6 months...before anyone should trust them. <br /><br />PERIOD.<br /><br />Selling btc is a serious thing...and only the most trusted vendors that have been here a long time should be trusted. <br /><br />That&#039;s my opinion.

				thanks, CR, for starting and maintaining this thread. i have been using bitinstant for years, and have no experience with any other bitcoin purchase system. i was trying to wait out bitinstant, but they don&#039;t give me any good news. besides, these humans could fuck up a cajun funeral, so i have no doubt bitinstant will be un-usable when they return.

				I think most of the sellers there that are doing huge amount of transactions prolly have some sort of a legit business in place where they get a lot of deposits in their account so then the deposits for the bitcoins can blend in. Just me theory on it because otherwise yes you&#039;re right it would raise red flags.

				&nbsp;I second that spiraleyes! I did my first bitcoin transaction last week-used localbitcoins. Wonderful experience. Used a vendor with 100+ sales and 100% rating-she was very helpful and patient. i used vanillareload-and had my bitcoins in less than 5 minutes. I know several people have mentioned localbitcoins-but people keep asking where to get their coins-and I see no reason to use any other service. They have a good rating system, have escrow, and besides the in person transactions-there are moneypak, moneygram, bank deposit, western union, dwolla vanilla reload, netspend-etc. and there are vendors all over the world! i was really nervous and that first deal reassured me tremendously. Just use common sense-an experienced, well-rated vendor, and follow the vendor instructions on their personal trade page to the letter-and im sure you will have good luck also.. BTW there are also vendors who do cash in mail sales as well. So pretty much all the bases are covered. USE THE ESCROW for online transactions-don&#039;t think that is recommended for p2p transactions though, as you should have bitcoins in hand before you leave the meeting place. Good luck for many stress free highs!!!

Ukash to Cash to BTC is probably the only way. Or Ukash to Dwolla to BTC as a few exchanges accept Dwolla. <br /><br />You might even find someone on localbitcoins to who accepts it. Also check the bitcointalk forum: bitcointalk.org

				I&#039;m trying to buy some BTC using localbitcoins. There isn&#039;t anyone close to my location so can&#039;t do the transaction in person. So instead I wanted to pay over the counter at a bank to avoid leaving a paper trail, but all the sellers I&#039;ve been speaking to have demanded a transfer from my account to their account.<br /><br />Am I just being too paranoid and should I just do the transfer instead of hoping to retain some sort of anonymity?
