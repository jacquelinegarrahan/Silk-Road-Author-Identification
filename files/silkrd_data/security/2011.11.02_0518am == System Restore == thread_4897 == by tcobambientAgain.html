				Do you think a system restore on Windows 7 would wipe out the bitcoin passphrase?

				Probably not, but if there are coins in the wallet I&#039;d think a backup of your Bitcoin data directory -- or at least wallet.dat -- would be prudent.&nbsp; (IIRC, Windows 7 restore asks if you want to preserve a copy of C:\Users which, if that&#039;s where your Bitcoin data lives, would accomplish the same thing.)

				back up wallet.dat.<br /><br />I would copy it to a memory stick, personally, but saving it to an alternate directory somewhere, even on a different partition, should keep it safe.<br /><br />either that or transfer the btc onto MtGox or something first, then do the restore, then just transfer it back.&nbsp;

				Nope.&nbsp; I tried to outsmart Bitcoin but it wasn&#039;t having any of it.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;ve lost the bitcoins and I&#039;ll write down everything in the future.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a shitty week for me on SR.&nbsp; Mostly my own fault.

				I was putting debian (linux) on here as a dual boot with windows 7...had some lightweight problems which were driving me batty, something small, but irritable, so after a few times, I just what I thought was the wise thing and did a complete reformat and linux install, and of course wiped out my wallet.dat...and didn&#039;t even think about it for a few weeks of use, since SR was down, june....lost&nbsp; about 40bc, if I remember right...but they were worth much more, seemed like a few hundred bucks...lots of people on here helped me, u know, to try to recoever it, so if you do a&nbsp; search a few months back, they had several good suggestions on recovering wallet.dat...all is not lost, and you would want&nbsp; to look for it before it gets all covered over.&nbsp; Several were of putting a live linux distro on a flash drive...I&#039;d used xpud before for stuff like this...<br /><br />best wishes

				You may already be aware of this, but I&#039;ve found most of my bitcoin problems solved on bitcointalk...this thread sounds similar to what you describe...and I signed up there, and found help whenever I got stumped: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25091.0
