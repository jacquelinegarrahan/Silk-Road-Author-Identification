				I read a few guides here and else where, having a real pain in the ass getting gpg going through gpa or seahorse in Ubuntu.&nbsp; <br /><br />I created a key, ok that seems to work.<br /><br />Then I gave my key to 3 people to sort of make sure it worked.<br /><br />One person could send me an encrypted message I was able to decrypt, I was unable to ad that persons key to my keyring, I even erased all keys and tried to re-add, no dice.<br /><br />The other 2, I could add their key with no problem but when they sent me an encrypted message, it shows me jackshit when I decrypt it, it asked for my passphrase and gives no errors, it&#039;s almost like it&#039;s empty - IN BOTH CASES.<br /><br />Probably something simple I overlooked.&nbsp; I&#039;m extremely eager to get pgp up and running immediately.<br /><br />Another thing, lets say I want to just encrypt a message and pm it to someone, I keep looking for the best way to do this and I keep seeing guides talking about created a text file&nbsp; then encrypt it?&nbsp; Is it secure to have plain text files saved on your computer even if you erase them after? I thought it&#039;s possible to find erased stuff.<br /><br />Is there any way to just click &quot;encrypt text&quot; or something and typing the message you want encrypted?<br /><br />What am I missing?<br /><br />

				I use PGA rather than Kleopatra, and it has a clipboard where you just type up the message you want, then encrypt it with the keys I&#039;ve got stashed there.&nbsp; Seemed simpler to use.<br /><br />I do keep my public key in a text file on my&nbsp; my Desktop for sending off to others.&nbsp; I like PGA better.&nbsp; But I have Debian OS, and don&#039;t use email program so about all I use gpg for is to send pms on here.&nbsp; Were you able to decrypt the file I sent you?<br /><br />One thing I found in Windows, if I remember right, is you have to be careful that you have wordrap format &#039;off&#039; in your text files.&nbsp; (I forget what it&#039;s called,) but if you open up a file and encrypt it and have the format thing &#039;on&#039; it can cause problems.&nbsp; In linux I just use PGA and I like it better...with the clipboard I don&#039;t have to worry about any of that...<br /><br />You did check out that tutorial, right?&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty handy, doesn&#039;t take that long:<br />http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium.html

				I don&#039;t run windows, I&#039;m running Ubuntu and thanks to you now tails.<br /><br />Also..THANKS ALOT, the clip board feature is also in GPA which I guess is this distro&#039;s version of PGA.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t look at it until you mentioned it.&nbsp; Worked like a charm for both you and the other guy I was able to import their key.<br /><br />In the case where I was able to read a message but not import the person&#039;s key I did it through the command line by just typing gpg it asked the message and I pasted the encrypted message in and it showed what he wrote.&nbsp; But when I tried doing the same thing with you and the other guy it just showed what looked like success but no message, it looked like the person sent a blank message it had the headers or whatever.<br /><br />Umm&nbsp; If the member who I&#039;m having trouble importing his key is willing to post here and put his key up for others to see what I might be doing wrong it would be appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried importing him after importing everyone (thanks for a members AWESOME advice of copying each page and letting gpg/gpa do the work) from the public key thread, I tried importing his through PM and couldn&#039;t find him after wards to encrypt a message to.&nbsp; I then erased all of the keys I imported before and imported just him, still didn&#039;t show up. <br /><br />Either way thanks alot, the clip board is what I&#039;m looking for and so far as far as reading your messages it works, I&#039;d like to post an encrypted message now for you to tell me if you can read it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />hQEMAwisYFpLTWUcAQf/VfZSByfiAhiL+9bLlU8s1CVILOhY4lgc3xMyv+ZBQvtc<br />pZ/ewb9WY5WZWTjCkyx1Yqdz0yQrwGFnAs3Ftz4VenfcPVSBksiA2pw1w2Q/tUgs<br />dDD3SUoPrt/b3zg6oe3gbQCgFXlKjAch3K5BXYMBt0jsbIP4k4jmyqQZsBQA6uUK<br />75ktnt2f8t+GnolhkpsEDjtbQaDAg9HKq/JZGzXDSNzgtmp2dCxxdznR2TnNTfZg<br />3pQ7GqF2ZSAOkkR8I29/pXeqGkcPC0pE9ralOq813r/jNVaEkW+8ZM4ngeGIBWnE<br />Xf8SZGKiy2Q70tGqQna8RnKKqhLSgxZqTifDADWvUdJhAbujT1+H33zo92o5owNC<br />BIlPbQpJ8quIya9ryZ4LtQTYXFEIGXNiVrlq1ZQNWUQ7xmeOBiX+wAInLeutvAXL<br />5Uk0QM4QBrKvHrmQnjbaItKjSthby+lJ0PcDJhbb5US3zw==<br />=CbbX<br />- -----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJOKwT5AAoJELVmfqlPopvvw6kH/1Hkft6Qf8wNQbKFt/7oKxgL<br />hsV81/CT9WkUna/3eyAhqLNwzlHFxy3Jf2i6Wm1VJPtJ32AhA839KYcuhrhbggHJ<br />6OJXoSMhO97RIMAfNAZbTpW2PQucB72mIwHShHraaREl1ByzXAUaI4Lpl0+ahwN6<br />nwxePgTYbkfB0+fCHbil5ajp9FLQHR9WOS33LX2AwHUs1wY5Nolz6XdAAXXXWmc2<br />NDBJYiZ8ihKuK+EbfuDC+yqhiSnf4lVXpDDf8HgBTagi9MfY1Wm7GOzborf5m20V<br />PXE6Xnh1B2qMe9G8t2L8V4xdAKQSwYvkvQK/QDXPjtETbotsbMFEwa3LFTrv66o=<br />=VxO/<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br /><br />Hope that was done correctly.
