				Hi, my friend who is bad at english has requested me to ask the SR forums this thing.<br /><br />He would like to put in a large order with a&nbsp; good reputated seller for a quite big amount of BTC. ~~ 350 coins. But seller wants him to finalize early.<br /><br />Seller is ok trusted, my friend has got around 4-5 positive transactions all finalized early and no auto-finalize.<br /><br />Whats your advice?

				U got it wrong mate, my buddy already has the BTC and is looking to buy the product.<br />Well I dont know, theres really no alternative is there? I can see seller has a risk too, question is who is going the take the risk? seller or buyer?

				Sorry, understand now.&nbsp; Many sellers want first timers (or at least those with few transactions) to finalize early.&nbsp; The smart way to do it is to make small buys until you become a trusted customer.&nbsp; But, if I were him I would try another seller.&nbsp; There are some that will not request early finalization.&nbsp; However, if your sure it is a very trusted seller like Dutchshop or Exchange I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll have a problem.
