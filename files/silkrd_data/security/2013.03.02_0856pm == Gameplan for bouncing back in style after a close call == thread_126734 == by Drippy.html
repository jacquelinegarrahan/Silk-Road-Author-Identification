				Not going to go into details about what happened, but quick synopsis is that a package was intercepted and a knock and talk went down w/ someone I&#039;m affiliated w/.&nbsp; Nobody is getting arrested, they didn&#039;t talk, and I doubt they&#039;ll come back w/ a warrant for them (wouldn&#039;t matter anyways if they did), but I&#039;d like to play things safe.&nbsp; Had a couple questions about this though...<br /><br />- Is starting over w/ a new GPG key going to be a red flag to any vendors?&nbsp; I just realized my current key is using an older type of encryption, and I&#039;d like to start over fresh.&nbsp; I&#039;m map gassing the hard drive it was on, but I backed up all my SR related data on a flash drive and stashed it at a buddy&#039;s just in case.<br /><br />- Any ideas on how to deal w/ my absurd refund rate I just incurred?&nbsp; The package was verified intercepted and the vendor refunded w/o hesitation, but SR calculates refund rates based on amount of money not number of transactions.&nbsp; This was a pretty sizable package, so my refund rate just went from 0 to damn near 50% over 1 of the 10ish purchases I&#039;ve made :(&nbsp; Should I just start a new account, or is there more civilized way to deal w/ this?&nbsp; Clearly I wasn&#039;t in the wrong here, and would prefer not to have to start over w/ my rep over this.<br /><br />- Should I decide to keep my current account, do y&#039;all think vendors are gonna be sketched out by the fact that I was one of many people who had a package intercepted on a shipment where one of the buyers was most likely LE?<br /><br />Basically, I want to make sure this situation doesn&#039;t ruin my standing on here, and any advice on the above questions or otherwise would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Also, please don&#039;t PM me asking for details about what vendor or how things happened.&nbsp; Not talking about that w/ anyone but the vendor himself and SR staff.&nbsp; Not posting the vendor&#039;s name publicly b/c he&#039;s the fucking man, and I don&#039;t want this thread to turn into a discussion about what&#039;s going on w/ him.

				Glad to see you back, Drippy.&nbsp; Get in touch if you need anything.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />My advice ... your new PGP key shouldn&#039;t cause any problems - just be sure to provide it each time and if it&#039;s for a vendor you&#039;ve used before, then just let them know you have a new key.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t be an issue though because plenty of people end up needing new keys for one reason or another.<br /><br />You may *want* to start a new account for the sake of simplicity since I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything that can be done about your refund rate, and just as an additional security measure.&nbsp; Totally up to you though.
