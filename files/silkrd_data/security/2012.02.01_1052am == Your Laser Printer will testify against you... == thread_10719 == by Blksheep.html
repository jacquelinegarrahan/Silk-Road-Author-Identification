				Having worked in computers for 20 years I came across this article years ago and for some reason it just popped into my head. I am not going to go into &#039;why&#039; you should be concerned... this is just an FYI:<br /><br />Government Uses Color Laser Printer Technology to Track Documents<br />Practice embeds hidden, traceable data in every printed page.<br />By Jason Tuohey, PCWorld&nbsp; &nbsp; Nov 22, 2004 4:00 am<br /><br />WASHINGTON--Next time you make a printout from your color laser printer, shine an LED flashlight beam on it and examine it closely with a magnifying glass. You might be able to see the small, scattered yellow dots printed there that could be used to trace the document back to you.<br /><br />According to experts, several printer companies quietly encode the serial number and the manufacturing code of their color laser printers and color copiers on every document those machines produce. Governments, including the United States, already use the hidden markings to track counterfeiters.<br /><br />Peter Crean, a senior research fellow at Xerox, says his company&#039;s laser printers, copiers and multifunction workstations, such as its WorkCentre Pro series, put the &quot;serial number of each machine coded in little yellow dots&quot; in every printout. The millimeter-sized dots appear about every inch on a page, nestled within the printed words and margins.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a trail back to you, like a license plate,&quot; Crean says.<br /><br />The dots&#039; minuscule size, covering less than one-thousandth of the page, along with their color combination of yellow on white, makes them invisible to the naked eye, Crean says. One way to determine if your color laser is applying this tracking process is to shine a blue LED light--say, from a keychain laser flashlight--on your page and use a magnifier.<br /><br />Crime Fighting vs. Privacy<br />Laser-printing technology makes it incredibly easy to counterfeit money and documents, and Crean says the dots, in use in some printers for decades, allow law enforcement to identify and track down counterfeiters.<br /><br />However, they could also be employed to track a document back to any person or business that printed it. Although the technology has existed for a long time, printer companies have not been required to notify customers of the feature.<br /><br />Lorelei Pagano, a counterfeiting specialist with the U.S. Secret Service, stresses that the government uses the embedded serial numbers only when alerted to a forgery. &quot;The only time any information is gained from these documents is purely in [the case of] a criminal act,&quot; she says.<br /><br />John Morris, a lawyer for The Center for Democracy and Technology , says, &quot;That type of assurance doesn&#039;t really assure me at all, unless there&#039;s some type of statute.&quot; He adds, &quot;At a bare minimum, there needs to be a notice to consumers.&quot;<br /><br />If the practice disturbs you, don&#039;t bother trying to disable the encoding mechanism--you&#039;ll probably just break your printer.<br /><br />Crean describes the device as a chip located &quot;way in the machine, right near the laser&quot; that embeds the dots when the document &quot;is about 20 billionths of a second&quot; from printing.<br /><br />&quot;Standard mischief won&#039;t get you around it,&quot; Crean adds.<br /><br />Neither Crean nor Pagano has an estimate of how many laser printers, copiers, and multifunction devices track documents, but they say that the practice is commonplace among major printer companies.<br /><br />&quot;The industry absolutely has been extraordinarily helpful [to law enforcement],&quot; Pagano says.<br /><br />According to Pagano, counterfeiting cases are brought to the Secret Service, which checks the documents, determines the brand and serial number of the printer, and contacts the company. Some, like Xerox, have a customer database, and they share the information with the government.<br /><br />Crean says Xerox and the government have a good relationship. &quot;The U.S. government had been on board all along--they would actually come out to our labs,&quot; Crean says.<br /><br />History<br />Unlike ink jet printers, laser printers, fax machines, and copiers fire a laser through a mirror and series of lenses to embed the document or image on a page. Such devices range from a little over $100 to more than $1000, and are designed for both home and office.<br /><br />Crean says Xerox pioneered this technology about 20 years ago, to assuage fears that their color copiers could easily be used to counterfeit bills.<br /><br />&quot;We developed the first (encoding mechanism) in house because several countries had expressed concern about allowing us to sell the printers in their country,&quot; Crean says.<br /><br />Since then, he says, many other companies have adopted the practice.<br /><br />The United States is not the only country teaming with private industry to fight counterfeiters. A recent article points to the Dutch government as using similar anticounterfeiting methods, and cites Canon as a company with encoding technology. Canon USA declined to comment.<br /><br />http://www.pcworld.com/article/118664/government_uses_color_laser_printer_technology_to_track_documents.html

				Relevant: all those who use laser to print labels.<br /><br />On a related note, I wonder if there&#039;s soft or hard mod to block the printer&#039;s hidden function.

				Interesting... although the article mentions it&#039;s generally used for identifying forgeries, it could potentially used against SR venders. Might be worth picking up a cheap inkject printer just to be on the safe side, as mentioned.

				Yes, I think most of us are aware of these things. Not to be paranoid, but I think of anything I purchase as being directly traceable to me unless I can show it to be otherwise.<br /><br />For your source of packaging, label makers, paper, ink, digital cameras et al, it is preferable to buy 2nd hand. Optimally with cash. It is cheaper and less traceable.

				I would suggest that using yellow paper would not help; the &#039;combination&#039; mentioned might refer to it using its&#039; own white with the yellow, and given the micro nature of the technology, sufficient magnification/led reaction would function regardless.

Done.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Problem: I don&#039;t know of a single inkjet printer that has ink that doesn&#039;t run if wet. This is a problem with making labels, you never know when it will rain and if it falls on the label, it will run. I got a package from a vendor who used inkjet, and it must&#039;ve got wet along the way. I could barely make out my address; luckily the postman could.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am happy my inkjet labels are not water resistant. It is a good excuse for the wide clear tape I use to waterproof them (that also helps secure the package). <br />I was also wondering if printing a scattering of yellow dots in a random pattern might obscure the coded message (for people with a nice lazer printer they want to use).<br />Thought it good to bump this topic to resurface this warning about &quot;color laser printer steganography&quot; letting LE know what printer printed those nice labels on that SR package. I got lucky and chose an inkjet (that hopefully they do not have a similar danger added to) before learning about this. Vendors should probably get a warning about color lazer printers in the vendor guide or a guide added and stickied that was not provided by SR staff so they are not seen as encouraging law breaking ;-).

				Your best bet, if you are into it bigtime, would be to buy a second hand laser printer off of craigslist or the like....not ebay or amazon, nothing that could trace the money back to you.<br /><br />While you are at it, get an old pre-P4 computer because the NSA leak suggests that they can monitor all actions through your hardware.&nbsp; I would think, since it&#039;s leaked now, that the technology would be around 10-15 years old, and I do remember reading about such things implanted in chips and motherboards.

				Wonder how many other things are compromised like printers to get the big 3 that covers everything-pedophiles, terrorists and drugs? Seems anything is ok to do if it&#039;s to catch THOSE guys.&nbsp; <br />It sure would be dumb these days to use a cell phone to make drops, if&nbsp; you had local customers. <br />Hell the way the internet is going these days, your printer will be updated by your phone which also updates your refrigerator and thermostat, etc. <br />That &#039;Real ID&#039; thing is coming pretty soon too, and it will be incrementally be used to make people less anonymous. Governments are fucking evil. The people we vote in don&#039;t care about privacy (even the ones who stay awake in briefings like so many agencies have claimed to be doing)<br />You know when they did the altered terrorist prisoner tactics (which some say are torture) the CIA took notes through all the briefings about who was present, when they went to the bathroom, etc. because they knew that later they would claim that the politician&nbsp; &#039;missed&#039; that briefing and &#039;I had NO IDEA that we were using torture!) Are the old pagers around any more? That was only &#039;one way&#039; communication, wasn&#039;t it?<br />I too remember back when the specific id thing with the processors made a lot of people mad, and Intel and/or AMD changed the code so that it didn&#039;t do that anymore. I bet they do that now. <br />&nbsp;

				hi<br /><br />how about watermarking&nbsp; the labels with colors of various dots and sizes... <br /><br />which are not so noticeable...&nbsp; wrt to the address.. <br /><br />Anyway if this was true in so many years the hacker community would have traced the problem, and would have workarounds <br />around the issue. <br /><br />Do we have any metric on this kind of information being used on any investigation or in a court case ?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you get a monochromatic blue light and use to to view the page in a dark room the yellow dots should become very obvious black dots.<br /><br />Black only laser printers have not been shown to have this feature. Very few bubblejets have this feature but some have been found.<br /><br />This is primarily to prevent forgery, thankfully they are not targeting text printers like those used to make labels.
