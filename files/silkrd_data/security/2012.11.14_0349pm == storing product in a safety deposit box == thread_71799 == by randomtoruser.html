				bulk illegal substances in&nbsp; safety deposit box safe yes or nay? also this individual is fairly young and more then likely the bank gets his direct deposit and knows how much he makes which is not much. im a little paranoid possibly due to a coke comedown but is it not suspicious that a young lad who doesn&#039;t make much money has a safety deposit box? and will more then likely visit it on a weekly or biweekly basis. i know the answer to this already of course. i just need more clarification on anyone with experience in this department. also this is NOT me btw. i would clearly read into this before doing it myself. i am truly concerned for a friend

				I would say that a young person with a small income visiting a po box once a month or more would set off alarms if anyone noticed(ie. the regular teller).

				Sounds pretty nuts. There would have to be a million better ways than this. If I wanted to have something not associated with me, I would not want my name all over it otherwise there is absolutely no possible way of denying it&#039;s mine. This is an assumption, but I don&#039;t think that people visit their safety deposit boxes on a regular basis. My parents used to store diamonds and other stuff in one and I don&#039;t think he visited it once in 20 years.<br /><br />You&#039;re better off just getting stash jars, coke cans with false bottoms, or as the other guy said.. Just bury it in the back yard, something like that.
