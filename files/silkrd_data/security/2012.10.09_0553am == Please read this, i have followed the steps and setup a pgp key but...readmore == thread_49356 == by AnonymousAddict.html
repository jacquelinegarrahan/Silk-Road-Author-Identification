				Read pine&#039;s thread on PGP. There is a link in my signature. What you want to do is, put the message into the clipboard. Click &quot;encrypt&quot; and select the VENDORS key. That&#039;s it. It should make a PGP message and your done. It&#039;s automatically signed by you. I did this a few times when I first learned, signing it by me. But it really is asking WHO can decrypt the message.<br /><br />From what I read, you encrypted it to yourself, with HIS key in the message. You need to import the key into your keyring. Hope I helped.

				Try saving his key as a text file (click File on whatever program you&#039;re using, and choose &quot;save as&quot;).&nbsp; Maybe your program doesn&#039;t recognize the format whatever your word editor is using<br /><br />Also, be careful with that adderall.&nbsp; My friend basically had a heart attack when he took too much...and he&#039;s totally clean now.&nbsp; Well, besides alcohol.&nbsp; And cigarettes.&nbsp; And monster energy (caffiene)&nbsp; Hey people, those are drugs too!

				I didn&#039;t realize you are using gpa. Also using Liberte?<br /><br />Anyways, your key should be in the main keyring. You just right click and click &quot;copy&quot; you should get a message like &quot;The keys have been copied to clipboard&quot;. Then you can paste that in your clipboard in order to decrypt it IN your PGP message. Just type the message, paste the key in after, then click encrypt and use the vendors PGP key.<br /><br />I think you are over-complicating the process or you have the wrong vendor key. Make sure your vendor key is correct.

Your key should be among those listed&nbsp; there.&nbsp; If you look in the first column, you will see a symbol that looks like a little key.&nbsp; Silver (or gray) colored keys are those belonging to other people; your own keys should look like a pair of little keys, one yellow or gold, and the other silver or gray. <br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t have that many keys on your ring; you should be able to pick your out by that method easily. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
