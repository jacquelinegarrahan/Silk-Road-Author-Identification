				So I am admittedly a noob and didn&#039;t use a library or other remote terminal to access mt. gox. to get coins. What is the likelyhood that I am screwed on a scale of one to ten? One being no fucks were given, ten being eat all the xanax in the world and wait for the end.

				I don&#039;t know why people keep forgetting that the action of buying BTC is completely legal. Even if it&#039;s relayed in your IP.

				What do you mean &quot;you people&quot;? just kidding, no trust me i fully realize purchasing bitcoins is legal I am more concerned of whether it is a flag to be watched by any of the alphabet mafiosos

				Consider that there&#039;s probably a huge volume of transactions being made through mt gox, I find it highly implausible that they have someone notice a small transaction of bitcoins (like &lt; 100), or care enough to go through all the legwork to trace it, confirm it&#039;s being used illicitly, and then go through all the procedures of notifying authorities.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically you&#039;re just really paranoid about something really trivial.<br /><br />On a scale from 1-10?&nbsp; I&#039;d say 2, just to give you something to brew on.

				If somebody wanted to trace who bought your BTC&#039;s and where, they could easily do it via the block chain. If you&#039;re just buying small amounts then it&#039;s unlikely an investigator would bother to deal with you but just to be sure, I&#039;d run the coins through a fog.

				Assuming you buy small amounts of drugs for personal use and order from a well known vendor that doesn&#039;t fuck up packaging, I&#039;d say 2 out of 10.

				I guess I get why you ask the question, we all start somewhere. But why don&#039;t people ever do their own research? Especially on these forums which has wealth of info. Try searching for things like PGP and Bitcoin, BitInstant, and 711 on the main menu. Read certain things before jumping in and making a purchase. It feels more rewarding when learned didactically and you&#039;ll have a better understanding.&nbsp; ;D

				Wash your coins and you&#039;ll be off to a start.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry, there is very little risk in what you did.<br /><br />Everyone who cares about security should wash their coins before they use them or withdraw them though.
