				Hey I have a question about cashing out which i havnt seen on the forums.<br /><br />Is there a way to auto cash out if your the vendor?<br /><br />Lets say you sell something for 1 BTC, and assuming 1 BTC = $100.<br /><br />So after the escrow fees are deducted and orders are finalized, the 1 BTC (minus the fees) gets transferred to my vendor&#039;s account.<br /><br />Now I want to cash out into USD immediately.<br /><br />Is there a way to quickly auto cash out from silk road into something like my BIPS or Mt. Gox wallet as soon as the coins hit my vender account on SR?<br /><br />I just want to make sure that the USD amount i sell my goods for will be exactly the amount i get in USD cash after the transaction is over just in case there are crazy fluctuations in the coin market.<br /><br />Anybody got any info on this?<br /><br />Also does anyone know how much USD exactly is the silk road vendor bond? I calculated few weeks ago and thought it was around 300 but now it seems to be around 450.<br /><br />Thanx yo,<br />Mad J
