				I finally made through Dwolla....got into MT Gox (don&#039;t ask my why I didn;t just try trade hill) and then tried to load by newly bought bit coins into the windows wallet downloaded from the the bitcoin site.<br /><br />4 connections.....sometimes 8......slowly loading blocks...I&#039;m rubbing my hands together in anticipation and then nothing. I had shut the tor borwser down (along with vidial and tor...I was doing this in the open) when the traffic stopped. I tried loading back up the portable FF based tor package and some fraffic came back and then poked around a bit and noticed people had been getting way more connections and port 8333 may help.<br />Go into router, forward port, REBOOT (facepalm) and now nothing.<br /><br />I wish I knew how to re initiate a connection between Gox and this (way simple) Bitcoin client<br />Anyway, am I screwed?<br />

				Well, after trying both another (smaller) transaction at mt gox and opening a tradehill accoiunt and trying a small transaction with then=m it seems thwre is some motion in my client again. Slow as hell though.<br /><br />What do you folks use for offline wallet clients, something with a nit more of a gui than the one from the bitcoin site hopefully?

				I don&#039;t know if this helps, since I did all mine on linux, but I will say after installing my bitcoin yesterday and after about 18 hrs had gone by, with blocks either stopping or just barely moving I got frustrated and bought some bitcoins just to see if I could load them....nothing happened, then sent about 1btc from my account on SR, and still, I had about 125000 slowly building blocks, but nothing added to account...I&#039;d posted on some forms asking what was up...<br /><br />Anyway right around 24-26 hrs after I frst started, it finished loading the blocks and showed the added btc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why it took forever: I thought it was something to do with linux...<br /><br />I know this didn&#039;t help you much, just wanted you to know you weren&#039;t the only one having some troubles with their bitcoins....I&#039;d reformatted windows yesterday, and forgot about my bitcoins, and lost around 47 btc ... and now I&#039;m in my very expensive linux setup, I&#039;m having to redo all that...hope your&#039;s straightens out too...

				134975, thats the current block count. it goes up ever 10 or so minutes, as a block is found. you will not see any transactions made to your public keys in the bitcoin client until your client has at least downloaded the block it was contained in. it can take a couple hours or more, network depending, to get the entire block chain. as long as your client has the private key corresponding to the public key the BTC was sent to, aka in your &quot;receiving addresses&quot; it should list the addresses you can send to.

				I left it running all night....everything came through. Whew!<br />I even opened a Tradehill account (was using Mt Gox for my first (too big for experimentation) send) and sent (just) 1 BTC through. Still slow but by morning everything is here.<br /><br />Way sorry about the format thing dude.<br /><br />I immediately (after doing a lot of reading and learning while worrying last night) backed up my wallet .dat files (all of them...everything in &quot;apps and doc\%user%\application data\bitcoin&quot;) to both a truecrypt section on my second driver and a truecypt file on a flashdrive.<br /><br /><br />Is it going to take that long to send them up to my SR account too?

				Any Bitcoin transaction generally takes about an hour to be verified.<br /><br />And you&#039;re only going to see such verification if your client has the entire block-chain.<br /><br />Until enough nodes confirm that you own the bitcoins that you&#039;re trying to send, and that you haven&#039;t spent them already, transactions take a while.<br /><br />Its the nature of Bitcoin<br /><br />- Bit<br />
