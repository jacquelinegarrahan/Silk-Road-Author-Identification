				Just curious if there is a way to receive money through these without compromising your identity.. <br /><br />There is a certain guy that has been selling mushroom spores for decades, and when making out a money order to him, you simply fill in the initials of the business name. Now, given spores are legal, the fungus that the spores come from are not. You can bet your ass the feds are frothing at the mouth over this, and he knows they know, and they know he knows they know. Yet, he is still in business..<br /><br />So eh, just curious. ;)

				I&#039;m honestly curious about this myself. The only way I can figure it&#039;s possible would be using a fake ID, or make good friends with an authorized WU agent.

				While I understand how you think the feds might be worried, it is a completely legal business, and the people I happen to know that run those businesses do it on the up and up. The spores are labeled for microscopy only, so anything done by the end user is on their own terms. Those folks have business accounts they go through, you can cash those MO&#039;s at any bank, and I&#039;m sure they put them in their business account. The only way they can possibly be messed with is taxes. Most companies selling syringes don&#039;t grow the mushrooms, the have a trusted grower who supplies prints which are legal as well. Nothing illegal is done at that point.

				Under a certain amount (300 I think) you can use a secret question and answer with whatever name instead of showing id.&nbsp; It used to be $1000 but they lowered it a couple years ago.<br /><br />You need to know the mtcn(transaction number) shippers name, amount, recievers name, and the question and answer.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even have to talk to them, you can just fill out the form, take it to the counter and it&#039;s all good. Obviously you can use a fake name since you don&#039;t need to show id.

				If the person who&#039;s buying from you is trusted, you can just use a fake ID to pick it up or use the security question method. In either case, if the feds are after you they already know your city and likely are cooperating with WU somehow to flag it so when you try to pick the money up the computer won&#039;t let you, but notifies them or some thing like that.
