				Hello everyone. I&#039;m still fairly new here and I was just wondering are Coinbase and Mtgox good sited to buy your bitcoins. I&#039;m aware there are plenty of sites where you can get your bitcoins, and I&#039;m unaware what the difference between all these sites are. Thank you very much for your time.

				It would be in your best intrest not to use mtgox or dwolla with anything attached to Silk Road they are all going to have paper trail best bet is buying through bitinstant if your in the united states or buy locally like me the fees are cheaper then bit instant
