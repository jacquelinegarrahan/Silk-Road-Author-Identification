				I used to use a bitinstant moneygram cash deposit at my local supermarket to get my bitcoins. Then I discovered bitfloor, so i started making anonymous cash deposits at BOA because bitfloor charged less fees. Then bitfloor got shut down so i went back to bitinstant. Now apparently bitinstant requires proof of I.D to buy bitcoins now, so I need a new anonymous method to get them. I&#039;ve heard of two possible options: localbitcoins, or using a third party bitcoin vendor on SR to get them. I would rather learn how to use localbitcoins because getting them from SR seems a little sketchy. Could someone please give me step by step instructions on how to use localbitcoins anonymously to get my coins? it seems a little confusing

				Find a vendor <br /><br />Request a trade- when trade is requested the coins from the vendor wallet are moved to escrow where they are held til payment is received.<br /><br />Pay with whatever payment method the vendor accepts (BoA deposit, western union, prepaid debit, paypal,cash) any payment method u can think of at least one vendor will accept,<br /><br />After payment the vendor will release the coins from escrow and they will be transferred to your localbitcoins wallet where then u can send them off to SR or any other wallet site.

				Localbitcoins is very legit, as long as you find a reputable seller, it&#039;s super easy considering the website has it&#039;s own escrow system and wallet built in

				&quot;Can I use my localbitcoins wallet as the backup wallet in case SR gets shut down or something&quot;<br /><br />Is using your SR wallet as your main wallet a seriously bad idea, in case something happens to SR? Do most people keep their bitcoins in off-line wallets?

You just request an order, the seller accepts (i think), the coins go into escrow and you have 90 minutes to make the deposit, get back to your computer and click &quot;I made the deposit&quot; or something.<br /><br />Just go with a high rated seller and it&#039;s incredibly easy and anonymous. Just know that if you go with the bank deposit method, the bitcoins are more expensive.

				I&#039;ve only done two localbitcoins transactions and both were through BofA deposits using escrow. Very fast and convenient. Some vendors accept WU and Moneygram and other cash methods while some prefer meet up in person cash in hand and you watch the transfer. Regardless of how it&#039;s done I think the escrow system is a must.<br /><br />I send my coins to an offline wallet and from there to my SR wallet where I keep not much more than I plan on using quickly.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181574.msg1320055#msg1320055">Quote from: mrxempire on July 09, 2013, 04:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">what other method of payment is ther other than BOA deposits, and how do you do them?

				Hey, how do we know whether a website is clearnet/darknet? I&#039;ve been going on any website i&#039;ve needed to use using Tor. I never realized there was a security risk in doing so.

				Using LocalBitcoins is easy:<br /><br /><br />Make an account...Than click buy Bitcoins on top....in &quot;Change location&quot; put your zip code in and see who is selling close to you...and for how much.<br /><br />Some only sell to establish buyers, but many will sell to anyone....I always pick someone with a good history with good transactions and read the reviews.<br /><br />OK,&nbsp; now you have a vendor you like....click the buy button...you will see a box asking &quot;How much you wish to buy?&quot; add your dollars and the BTC will calculate it self...<br /><br />then add a message below like&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;when can you meet?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;the seller will return your message through LocalBitcoins ..(you will see a notification pop up when they reply.)..<br /><br />Now when you hit the &quot;Send trade request&quot;&nbsp; it will lock in the price you see at that moment.....so you want to make sure you can trade that day or the next....if you wait to long the seller will cancel because you are holding up their money.....YES the BTC you asked for is locked...and the vendor has to complete the transaction or cancel it.....so be ready for their response to your request.<br /><br />you will get a secret #...and see a receipt of your transaction..( never give out your #) when you meet up and exchange the money they will complete the transaction and read you the secret # you have..if they get it right , that means your money is in your account...done!...a no brainer!!!...just meet in a very public place ..i did all my stuff on my i-phone....<br /><br />the best part you can send PM&#039;s to each other through the LocalBitcoins site...so no personal info needs to be given...Plus ..IT is NOT ILLEGAL to buy BTCS!!<br /><br />Now you can also buy BTC online with bank deposits for those who offer it, click &quot;Buy bitcoins online in United States&quot; and see who you can buy from online by using a cash deposit option at the bank of their choosing.....and it seem safe, because your money is held in escrow....its that easy...<br /><br />I got some today and it worked out great..i had a good seller who gave me a fair price... :o...power to the people

				hey if anyones still interested to know, I was successfully able to use localbitcoins to get some BTC the other day. Used an out of state deposit slip at my nearest BOA to do it. However, there were a couple things i didn&#039;t like about the site. For instance, since you are buying the coins from another person, and not a business, the seller can charge whatever they like for the coins. I bought my coins yesterday, when the coins were under 100 dollars, but there were absolutely no sellers&nbsp; selling their coins for the market price. I paid about 105 per coin. Secondly, with many sellers there is a minimum purchase amount. I was trying to get about 3 or 4 hundred in coins, but when I went to try and buy them, I was told that I had to get a minimum of 500 dollars worth of coins. Now, this wasn&#039;t a big problem for me, as i am always going to need more coins eventually, but i could forsee this as a problem to some others who don&#039;t have as much spare money laying around. Anyway, thats my two cents. I&#039;m gonna look for a different site to get coins from, but if all else fails at least i can get them from here
