				mt.gox is an over inflated price due to the fact its fucking crazy hard or long to get your money out of it.......<br /><br />Think about the canadian vendors selling on SR 135$ then having to cash out on cavirtex at 125......<br /><br />This is life, up&#039;s and downs......<br /><br />Either buy at a better rate or shut up! :)<br />
