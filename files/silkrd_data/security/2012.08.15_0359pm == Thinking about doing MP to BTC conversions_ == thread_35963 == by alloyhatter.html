				I see the number of people who get scammed trying to do quick, anonymous MP to BTC conversions. Sometimes it makes me sad.<br /><br /><br />Sometimes I think to myself &quot;Well hey, I have no problem getting BTC into my SR account. And I wouldn&#039;t rip off people like those other assholes. And I sure do like profits, however minimal. Why doesn&#039;t ol&#039; alloygirl step in?&quot;<br /><br />So yeah, I&#039;ve been seriously considering investing a decent amount of money into my SR account so I can have funds ready for anyone who wants to send me a MP for conversion. I&#039;d probably be doing only small amounts or fee-free promotions or extra btc in the beginning.. something to build trust.<br /><br /><br /><br />Obviously, I&#039;m probably being an idiot and not realizing all the details that go into converting MPs to BTC, that&#039;s why I&#039;m posting. ....Please tell me why this is a shitty idea so I can stop daydreaming about being the next big BTC provider. I dunno, it kinda also stems from wanting to help the SR community. This place has made me really fucking happy.

				The problem you will run into is cashing out your MP&#039;s. MP watches their accounts, and if they suspect something strange is going on, they will freeze your account.

				Hi alloyhatter,<br /><br />Forgive me, but I believe what Christy Nugs is saying is that you have 11 transactions already, presumably for drugs, going by their value. Now you want to set up as a MP to BTC vendor.<br />As you have bought drugs, it&#039;s possible for a law enforcement officer to very easily find out where the MP&#039;s are being loaded to and cashed out from by making a transaction with you and having the MP traced, giving him/her your general geographic location.<br />It&#039;s then possible for them to be notified immediately when the card that the MP was loaded to is used (all traceable, don&#039;t forget, and sometimes virtually instantly) - they then will possibly have you on camera doing so.<br />Even without performing surveillance, it is possible that they will utilise any CCTV footage available to them - as they know where the MP was cashed out from, they may be able to get your vehicle registration number or other identifying information and track you down that way.<br />As Christy said, selling Bitcoin is not illegal. Purchasing and using drugs, on the other hand, is.<br /><br />It is INCREDIBLY important for any vendor to maintain a completely seperate buyer account, with NO links to their seller account. You have now stated, from your buyer account which you&#039;ve used to purchase items from Silk Road on a number of occasions, that you&#039;d like to set up a MP to BTC service. I&#039;d recommend that you put this idea to bed.<br /><br />Ideally, a vendor wouldn&#039;t purchase from the road at all, but I understand that the selection here can be quite tempting.<br />Any purchases made from the buyer account should be sent to an address entirely seperate from the seller&#039;s actual address; again, preferably not at all, but we&#039;re all human.<br /><br />The most important thing you have is your freedom. Unfortunately we live in a world where agents of the state exist solely for the purpose of taking those freedoms away. Instead of enjoying our natural freedoms as we should - without a care in the world - we now have to be smart about them. We have to be smarter than the people who wish to take them from us. We have to guard those freedoms, and afford them the same priority and importance as the very air that we breathe, because without our freedom, just as without the air we breathe, we have absolutely nothing.<br /><br />Stay smart. Stay safe.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I can tell you there is a demand for it; I am looking around for someone to do this for me (give me BTC in exchange for moneypak) but I can not find anyone that has been 100% trustworthy with no scam reports. alloyhatter please PM me if you do plan on doing this. <br /><br />Also, all I have to do to do this is purchase a MoneyPak and get the PIN number and send it right? Or does this involve the postal service?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!
