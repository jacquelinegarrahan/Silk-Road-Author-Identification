				As you can probably tell by this being my first post, I&#039;m new here to SR, although I&#039;ve been lurking for the past few weeks. I&#039;m now looking for a way to get BTC with just my credit card, in a similar fashion to paying for anything else online. I&#039;m looking for a way to do this without having to go to a bank, deposit cash, or anything of that sort. I&#039;m trying to make this seamlessly online. I have reasons for such, but would rather not get into that.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated. I&#039;m trying to get some damn &#039;shrooms! <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Uke

				I&#039;m not entirely sure that&#039;s possible, would be a very bad idea anyway. You don&#039;t want any personal info tied to anything you do here.

				Hi UkeOnyx,<br /><br />Due to the possible risk of chargeback fraud, no Bitcoin exchange will allow the use of credit cards as bitcoins are non-refundable. I recall seeing one recently that said they had a system for beating chargebacks, but I can&#039;t recall their name, and having not heard of them since I presume they went out of business, perhaps as a result of chargebacks making the entire operation entirely unprofitable.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				A few used to exist but noone does it anymore, absolutely noone. <br /><br />It&#039;s too easy to buy credit card details online and then use them to buy bitcoins and run the bitcoins through bitcoinfog and become anonymous.

				I&#039;m new here and I&#039;ve been researching bitcoins a ton. I actually know of a way to use your CC or even Paypal to get bitcoins but it involves some work and it&#039;s not tested by me so take it for what it&#039;s worth. (I personally am going to just use BitInstant) Anyhow, here&#039;s how you do it:<br /><br />You&#039;ll first need to purchase a different type of currency called SLL or Linden$. This is the currency used in the role-playing game called Second Life. To do so you would head over to https://www.virwox.com/ and create an account. Once created you have the option to buy SLL via a CC or by Paypal. Once you purchase SLL from this company you can then use the withdraw feature to convert your SLL into BTC.<br /><br />There are some issues though. Firstly, the company enacts limits on accounts to prevent chargebacks. New accounts can only transfer 40EUR/52USD in 24 hours and 140EUR/152USD in 30-days. However, your account automatically gets its limits increased the longer you have an account. It works like this: the time starts from the moment you make your first CC/Paypal deposit. Here&#039;s how the limits increase:<br /><br />10 days since first deposit: 60EUR/78USD in 24/h. 300EUR/390USD each month.<br />60days: 100EUR/130USD in 24/h. 1000EUR/1300USD each month.<br />90days: 200EUR/260USD in 24/h. 2000EUR/2600USD each month.<br /><br />The second issue is that there are fees for this service. It&#039;s not too bad from what I can tell but obviously it&#039;s far more pricy than just depositing by cash via Bitinstant.<br /><br />Keep in mind though there are inherent risks with obtaining BTC in this manner. You&#039;re essentially attaching your personal information to the SLL/BTC conversion. Hypothetically speaking though you could also hide your personal information when buying via CC or Paypal though by getting creative. For example, if you pay by CC you could use one of those prepaid CC&#039;s you buy at grocery stores. (I&#039;ve noticed some of those prepaid CC&#039;s have issues with authorization though) Also, if you pay by Paypal, you could use a prepaid CC that offers direct deposit and then add the info for it under&nbsp; the bank account section to make your Paypal verified. By doing this you could use completely fictitious information on the prepaid CC and under the bank account info and thus have an anonymous Paypal account to use for obtaining BTC.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tested any of this though. I&#039;m just putting this information out there in case anyone wants to try it or knows a reason why this absolutely won&#039;t work for some reason or another.&nbsp; :P

				I believe the last time I looked at the above method using Linden$ they needed your Second Life account details, which is extra hassle to go to as you need to make an account etc, although I suppose it could work.

				The quickest way to do that is to just go buy a Money Pak and have somebody on SR exchange it for BTC thats what i did.

In other words, it looks like you can just use a fake username without any issues. In fact, I created a dummy account and it says you&#039;re only required to verify this information is correct if you do one of the following:<br /><br />1. Attempt to deposit SLL you&#039;ve already earned in the game to your virwox account.<br />2. Attempt to withdraw SLL to your Second Life account.

After checking more into it, I think that can work. As for the CC, I think that&#039;s a risk I&#039;ll have to take. I also honestly think it&#039;s a result of ultra-paranoia to think the LEA is going to target me and back trace all of that. While it&#039;s better safe than sorry, and I may regret it if the party van pulls up outside of my place, I think it&#039;s a risk too slim to care about. <br />Time to buy some drugs! (I&#039;m going to try shrooms for the first time... excited)

				I&#039;m actually trying this method out now (with an anonymous card obviously). I bought the Second Life (Linden $) quickly, and then transferred them to bitcoins quickly, and now I&#039;m waiting for them to transfer the bitcoins into a bitcoin wallet I made. 24 hours so far and nothing, although they say it can take up to 48.
