				So i of course use tails on an encrypted Usb as everyone else does, alongside PGP and a few others. But i noticed that tails uses Iceweasel as its browser, Now i always thought the TOR browser was the only way to go, now i know how tails funnels its connection through etc and i know the technical side to is, but my question is this, Is it really safe? <br /><br />Using tails, when tails uses iceweasel as the browser, It connects through vidalia, and allows you to do a torcheck on your homepage, but it does not use the tor browser is it safe?

				Tor browser is just a modified version of firefox. Iceweasel is just firefox without the trademarked name.<br /><br />TAILS implements the same modifications as the tor browser bundle but also provides special firewall rules that prevent any attempt to connect directly to the internet.

				TAILS uses firewall/network level restrictions as opposed to user application restrictions.&nbsp; It forces Everything in the application layer through Tor, minimizing the room for error.&nbsp; &nbsp;This makes the TAILS environment much safer then most other options.&nbsp; Another good option, if you like keeping your own OS is installing Tor as a middlebox.

				I&#039;m a little confused.. so it is safe to use iceweasel as the browser?<br /><br />Also, it seems like since upgrading to Tails 0.18,&nbsp; I get more security warnings about going to non-encrypted pages, even when I&#039;m going page to page on SR. Thanks for the info.The security warning&nbsp; said something like this:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Security Warning<br />The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.<br /><br />Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?<br /><br /><br />Ps I got a warning when&nbsp; I posted this.......<br /><br />Thanks for the info.<br />

I mean fair enough, however the only thing that might worry me would be when you log in, to the forums or the main site you get the message as well, I wonder if it could be read easily why more accounts haven&#039;t been stolen.

				I am still concerned why I get these warnings. How do I encrypt while using Tails on .onion sites. I thought I was encrypted just by using tails. I get this warning almost everytime I post or go to an other page:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Security Warning<br />The information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.<br />Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?

				Actually you are seeing this error because the browser don&#039;t see &quot;https&quot; in your onion address it thinks that is not safe page because it lacks SSL (But its safe&nbsp; because is in the darknet, only the browser don&#039;t know), this message show always you enter a non-ssl page, but you can check a box that comes with the dialog that allows you not to see it again, that is what most of the people do so they only see it the first time they use the browser.
