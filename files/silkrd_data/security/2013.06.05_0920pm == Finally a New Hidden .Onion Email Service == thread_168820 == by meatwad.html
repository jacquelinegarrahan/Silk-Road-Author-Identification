				Mailtor.org -&nbsp; http://bdom5vcb53z5hqz5.onion/&nbsp; <br /><br />I stumbled across this while looking at a TOR directory that just lists the .onion address and no name for the website.<br /><br />Can anyone vouch for this service?&nbsp; It uses the same Roundcube Webmail that TORmail uses.&nbsp; It seems like we finally have another legit TOR email service, but time will tell. <br />Is there a way to check the website source code, etc.,&nbsp; to see if it has any malicious code in it?&nbsp; Would any knowledgeable and skilled people like to lend a hand?

				Great find Meatwad! I never liked the idea of everyone centralizing their email communication to one service. The more email Hidden Services the better IMO. <br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to connect via POP3 or IMAP4 though. I hope the operator of this HS enables these protocols in the future. I don&#039;t like to use web-clients if at all possible.

				squirrelmail! no java is great.<br /><br />tormail is down a lot and has its domain show up in global block spam lists often.<br /><br />would be useful if tormail or mailtor made a ton of alternate domains all pointing to same box. that is what we need.

				It doesn&#039;t matter what onion mail service you use. You have to assume that they&#039;re all compromised and thus GPG is required no matter what in all communications. Tormail works fine.

Although having the database for the emails on a server only accessible via Tor with SMTP relay Hidden services guarantees that if the relays are compromised the database server is not as the relay only has a hidden service and mapped IP. Therefore the database server remains location hidden. This way if you&#039;re using PGP They can&#039;t read your message, nor find the location of the email database server. This is what has allowed TorMail to exist as long as it has. Their relays go down often, and he simply spins up a new one on a different VPS, rinse and repeat. <br /><br />TLDR: having your emails reside in a database only accessible via Tor is more secure than conventional email (yahoo, hotmail, etc) as these email database servers are publicly known.

You can decrypt the info, save it, and then give it to the regulating bodies when they request it. There&#039;s no justifiable reason to abandon PGP.

I sort of just meant the nature of the transaction doesnt have anything revealing like what you&#039;d need to encrypt on SR like an address.
