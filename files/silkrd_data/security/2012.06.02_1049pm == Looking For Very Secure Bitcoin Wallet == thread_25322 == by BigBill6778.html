If you have a wallet installed on your computer it needs to update regularly to process recent transactions throughout the block chain. An online wallet does the same thing albeit it doesn&#039;t actually say it&#039;s processing as it&#039;s located on a server.<br /><br />In terms of security for your actual Bitcoins, using a wallet with an encrypted password and backing it up in a safe place is your best bet. Alternatively for long term savings you can use a &quot;brain&quot; wallet which is extremely easy to set up. I&#039;ve posted in the Security thread on how to do this.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

Its location will vary depending on what operating system you&#039;re using but you can find the info you need at : https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Introduction<br /><br />As I mentioned the wallet software will update itself regularly as it syncs with the block chain - this is important as it allows the software to show if you&#039;ve received any coins as well as sent any via your wallet.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				In windows the wallet is stored in %APPDATA%\Bitcoin. In mac I think in ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin. In linux I think in ~/.bitcoin or ~/.Bitcoin. So even if the applcation is on the usb disk the wallet data is stored in hidden&nbsp; data folders default in system drive. In windows %APPDATA% is like C:\Users\username\Application Data\Roaming and in mac ~ is /Users/username and in linux ~ is /home/username. In any case you just type the variable like original Start &gt; Run %APPDATA%\Bitcoin or Go &gt; Folder, etc.<br /><br />Maybe I missing something but why put bitcoin exe in encrypted disk?

It is true that your wallet.dat file is stored locally on your computer. It is possible to alter this through using what is called a symbolic link. If you use Linux provided your Home Directory is encrypted I don&#039;t think you need to be too worried if your laptop or computer is seized but do make regular back ups.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
