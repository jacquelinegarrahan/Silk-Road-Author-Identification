Encrypting your hard drive with Truecrypt would reduce the likelihood of data being seized but a forensic analysis could still reveal the &quot;bootloader&quot; i.e the program which asks for your password and actually decrypts the drive which means you&#039;d have no way of denying the machine&#039;s encrypted.<br /><br />If you really want to use Truecrypt with TAILS it is possible to install it each time you fire it up:<br /><br />- Put in the CD and boot your computer into TAILS.<br />- Select the &quot;more options&quot; button before logging in to set an admin password.<br />- Open up the IceWeasel browser and go to www.truecrypt.org/downloads<br />- Scroll down to Linux and select &quot;standard&quot; (32 or 64 bit depending on your machine - if unsure choose 32).<br />- Save the tar.gz file to your home folder or similar<br />- Exit Iceweasal and open the folder where the Truecrypt tar.gz file is stored.<br />- Right click the file and select &quot;Extract Here.&quot; The tar file will extract a setup file alongside itself.<br />- Right click this new file and click &quot;Properties&quot;. Click the &quot;Permissions&quot; tab and make sure the tick box is checked next to where it says &quot;Allow executing this file as a program.&quot;<br />- Close the window and double click the file.<br />- A terminal window will open. Choose Option 1.<br />- Press enter to view the licence. Press and hold enter again to scroll down. When given the chance type &quot;yes&quot; to say you agree to the terms.<br />- Enter the admin password you set up when logging in before to begin installation.<br />- Go to Applications at the top left &gt; Accessories &gt; Terminal<br />- Type &quot;truecrypt&quot; without the quotes and hit return.<br /><br />Congratulations you now have Truecrypt until you power off the machine at least...<br /><br />Watch this video to see how to use Truecrypt to create a USB stick with a hidden partition:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ_RBR9jVLQ<br /><br />Please bear in mind that you won&#039;t be able to use a USB with a hidden partition on Windows - not that you&#039;ll need to if you&#039;re using TAILS!<br /><br />Also take a peek at http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume-precautions - to see how you can make sure your hidden volume stays that way.<br /><br />Remember your first defence when it comes to your encrypted USB stick being seized should be to claim that it&#039;s not encrypted but has been wiped using a secure erasure program. It&#039;s nearly impossible to tell the difference between a USB that&#039;s been erased in this way i.e by overlaying it with random data and an encrypted stick.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have a question. For people like me who just buy and who only buy MJ and in relatively small quantities (say some brownies), is it really necessary to TrueCrypt and all that jazz? I understand why PGP is so important when communicating with the seller, but what are the chances of them actually seizing and searching my computer for SR type stuff.<br /><br />I mean, I intend to just hide my laptop anyway (while waiting for my order, so they&#039;d have to tear down my house to find even that.

If you don&#039;t have anything illegal on the premises however they may well seize your equipment to try to prove you had placed an order for illegal goods - encrypting your data makes sure they won&#039;t succeed. It really doesn&#039;t take long to do (around 10 minutes for a USB stick) and could save you a lot of trouble later on so I&#039;d suggest you take the time to learn about it, it really is quite simple.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
