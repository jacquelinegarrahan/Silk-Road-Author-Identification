				How can I completely remove tor from my computer? I&#039;m going to assume deleting it and emptying my recycling bin isn&#039;t enough

				If you think someone is going to perform a forensic analysis of your hard drive, you should DBAN it. Tor can leave all kinds of subtle traces that you may not be aware of: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.msg1152452#msg1152452<br /><br />They will still know that you wiped your hard drive.<br />

				you need to read up on Tails or booting up from a live OS then you will not have to worry bout leaving a trace...try using CCleaner or Eraser they delete items multiple times and encrypt each time making it harder to recover the items

				The only safe and simple choice is to completely format the hard-drive.<br /><br />You may remove the downloaded files easily but you could forget download history that shows you downloaded tor, or unrar/unzip history that shows you extracted tor, or browser history that shows you acessed the tor download page, or documents history that shows you executed tor, or software firewall permissions for tor, or many other types of evidence you are unaware of.<br /><br />Tails or another live OS is something you should look into.

				As astor said DBAN. Ccleaner drive wiper function will be similar but it won&#039;t wipe the whole drive. The OS will still be there.<br /><br />Best way to use Tor is from a TAILS CD as it won&#039;t store any data.

				I have heard that you can completly destroy your hard drive if you put it in the microwave.&nbsp; I wonder if that would really work?

				just dban or secure erase. Every week we get people asking this question and a thousand people giving crazy ideas like put it in microwave or pour cup of water on it. Just wipe the damn thing with DBAN or Secure Erase. Preferably Secure Erase followed by DBAN. Secure Erase is best. DBAN is second best. Both provides defense in depth in case of implementation errors in either. Nothing else is likely to be as secure short of melting the thing down into a liquid.

				You shouldnt be using tor on your own daily use computer. Use either tails or an encrypted virtual machine. Also best to use wifi away from your home. Come one man this stuff isnt hard. Securing yourself is just a check list you need to run down each time.
