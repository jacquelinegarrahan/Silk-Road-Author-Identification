				Using tor on android is not very safe, a lot of android apps eavesdrop, some phones take screenshots of all &quot;recent apps&quot; for example so I don&#039;t really think it&#039;s as safe as using a computer to go on TOR, I personally wouldn&#039;t use an android phone to access SR or the forums.

				A VPN doesn&#039;t increase security per se, it only hides that you&#039;re using TOR, and it&#039;s only beneficial when living in a rural area. Using a VPN sounds less good than using a regular entry guard though because it could deanonymize you more easily than if you&#039;re using a random entry guard each time.

				First of all I&#039;d recommend using the TOR browser for android by the guardian project, it&#039;s called orweb. I&#039;m pretty sure orweb is better since it was made for TOR. And yes, your ISP knows you&#039;re accessing TOR, unless you use a VPN, SSH, but it&#039;s generally not a big deal if you&#039;re in a city and not in a small rural area.<br /><br />Gibberbot is good but it&#039;s really unstable. There&#039;s also APG, an open source PGP client for android that works really well, it also works with K-9 mail which is pretty useful.<br /><br />And even the native apps can read your log data, and probably screenshots taken by your phone which is why it&#039;s generally less secure. You should install cyanogen instead of the regular android for added security and use things like privacy guard, firewall, etc. to be a little more secure.<br /><br />Using whonix over linux is the way to go, it&#039;s one of the most secure setups you can get!

				VPN is never a bad idea and is relatively easy to set up, lots of documentation out there for the tech newbies.
