				I see it continuing to de value for the next week or two bottoming eventually at 55.00 dollars before it begins to recover. I believe that since Bitcoin continues to struggle with its value on the weekend when people are off and buying more is not a great sign at this time. Further its going to see more the downward spiral starting Monday like we saw Friday.<br /><br />I say it will recover its value with prices like we saw but not at least for the next few weeks anyway!

				The way the companys assotiated with bitcoins are haveing trouble I&#039;m worried . I just bought a few btc this week less than I normally would just so I can get personal mdma and mushrooms. I&#039;m really wanting to buy more but I thi k the price is going to drop until it has almost no worth. Thier are other coins starting to make an ammergence like litecoin which I know nothing about. I hope I&#039;m wrong but I think next week it will be 50 and then keep droping for a month to about 20 then settle
