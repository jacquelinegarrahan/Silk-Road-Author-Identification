				just curious if anyone has experienced a computer screen go blank then a screen come up that says its the fbi shutting your computer down. there is even a thing where it turns your webcam on and records ( mine has tape over it) then there is sum rabble about a bunch of bullshit that they say you have dun ( most of which are very general ) and then the kicker they will turn your computer back on if you put a mp code in a blank ( they even have the links where u can buy mps.)<br />i noticed there was alot of misspelled words on the page that pops up (i kno i am&nbsp; not the one to spell check sumone). im sure this is just the latest virus or scam going around. i was mainly just curious if anyone else has experienced this. im 100% positive its no real fbi shit (even tho they did go through the trouble to paste their logo on the page) just an inconvience i think they were requesting a 200 dollar mp to unlock your computer. total bs really hate it when dumb shit like this pops up. obviously this is a seperate computer i havnt felt like dealin with that shit yet <br />but i am wondering where i may have gotten this computer std. anyone else ever herd of this one or am i just lucky? if i had to narrow it down i would say maybe a new download i have made? as creepy as this may come off i usually try n be carefull what shit i click on n download i dont even branch out on porn sites just to be extra safe just the one i kno should be straight (yea like any of em are) but i have also been getting pop ups for a new version or tor to download. ive never downloaded it cuz shit seemed just fine how it was and like i said i try n b careful what shit i click on or download. also i get pop ups for sum adobe update download which i also usually ignore. anyway long ass rant any takers on advice? or any other people catch that shit? maybe i just got lucky, shits lame. i figure in the morn ill try n do a restore point n hopefully that will do it.

				Anything trying to get you to buy a MP in order to unlock your computer is a malware extortion scam. Get this; the newest one of these to (literally) go viral tries to claim it&#039;s collecting a &quot;SOPA fee&quot;. Unreal.

				This is a fairly common ransomware infection that is making the rounds. I assume it&#039;s getting dropped heavily by someone who&#039;s bought a nice chunk of a botnet or could just be largely in the wild - haven&#039;t had enough time to see any patterns. Either way always good practice to scan for rookits after it&#039;s cleared.<br /><br />First you&#039;ll need the Kaspersky Rescue Disk (http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/rescuedisk) - boot to that and remove the inital ransomware infection.<br />Once it&#039;s removed the inital infection, load in to Windows and run: Combofix, Malwarebytes and TDSSKiller. Google these, easy to use.<br /><br />Also performing a system restore will do nothing at all to fix this!

				FBI Virus v2.0.&nbsp; The first one asked for $100, this one asks for $200.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t encountered it yet but have heard it&#039;s making it&#039;s rounds.&nbsp; Don&#039;t sweat it too much.&nbsp; Hirens Boot Disc is your friend to boot to mini XP and clear it with Malwarebytes and the like.&nbsp; Also, start using a virtual machine and booting a Linux distro when doing dodgy work to prevent stuff like this ;)
