				I searched for it but I didnt find anyone else posting about this site which list a bunch of secure alternatives to common online services such as browsers, e-mail, hosting, document sharing, etc which are freeware and attempting to offer secure options.<br /><br />Anyway, check it out and discuss.&nbsp; If there is already a thread, I apologize.<br /><br />The one thing that intrigues me is Kolab which offers email and hosting from Switzerland.&nbsp; Anyone use their services?<br /><br />Also, I am looking for the most secure clearnet email provider.&nbsp; I know nothing on clearnet is as secure as we would like it to be but I want to get away from he big boys because I know that shit isnt safe at all.&nbsp; I dont use that email for anything to worry about but I just dont want to give them my business when they are full cooperating with the NSA.

				Hmm, thanks for the link -- I&#039;ll be sure to check out some of the listed alternatives.<br /><br />I use countermail as my personal, &quot;secure&quot; email service. It&#039;s quite reputable from what I&#039;ve read/experienced. I recommend it with the utmost confidence.<br /><br />Only downside is: It isn&#039;t free<br /><br />But any decent email service, whether POP or IMAP, that secures itself and protects it&#039;s users, won&#039;t be free either.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am willing to pay to use a service as long as it is worth it.&nbsp; I understand that nothing on clearnet is going to be completely secure but I just dont want to give my business to the big boys when they are willingly sharing metadata without any effort to protect customers.<br /><br />I just want a somewhat secure place to have my email accounts and I am going to start encouraging friends to do so as well.

				I&#039;ve started using DuckDuckGo for searches and it works well.<br /><br />I joined Diaspora but havent gotten a chance to mess with it yet.<br /><br />I also opened an email account through Autistici which has to go through approval.&nbsp; You have to set it up through a client but I setup Thundermail and it has worked well so far.&nbsp; I have switched it over yet because I am considering setting up my own&nbsp; email server or at least getting some space and doing it through my own domain.<br /><br />Project Meshnet is an interesting concept.<br /><br />I tried to go to a couple of pages on there but it didnt work.
