				Hey guys. I run a &quot;grey area&quot; online business. There&#039;s this one asshole who&#039;s trying to blackmail me. I&#039;ve got his IP address. Does anyone know how I can find out his name or physical address? I just want to scare him off. He&#039;s with Delta High Speed Internet in BC, Canada.<br /><br />thanks.

				Unless you know someone within that ISP, or unless you have&nbsp; a court order, chances are you cannot.<br /><br />How is this guy trying to blackmail you? Rather, how did he find you?

				He&#039;s actually my competitor. We both advertise on the same discussion board. He found out my name and now he&#039;s threatening to post it if I don&#039;t leave. When he was fishing for more info, he placed a test order through my site. That&#039;s how I got his IP.

				You might get some luck googleing his IP and finding other stuff from that IP, which you can than link to a username or something (which in turn might help you end up on Facebook or something). The physical location of an IP can sometimes but determined, but most the time it cannot (especially if it&#039;s a dynamic IP). Only the ISP will know which IP is used where and they will not give you this information. Depending on the procedures of the ISP, a first line support guy will probably not be able to look it up (so social engineering is going to be hard). You can try of course, if you come up with a good story.

				We once had a guy attempt to blackmail us a few years back for $20,000.<br /><br />We won. :)<br /><br />There are many ways to deal with your situation. Especially if you have hacker friends.<br /><br />And especially in Canada (that was our situation too!). <br /><br />And especially if you have the guys IP.<br /><br />Good luck! ;)<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; <br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				Do an IP lookup,<br /><br />http://www.whatismyip.com/tools/ip-address-lookup.asp<br /><br />Find out his ISP call them.<br /><br />Give them his IP.<br /><br />Tell them he is committing fraud or some shit make up some real bad crap.<br /><br />Then Win! or ask for address I doubt they will give you it though but even an IP lookup should give his city that should help!<br /><br />

				you should bring this issue with board admin, releasing personal info is big NO NO on most UG boards. if he will do that he will ruin his reputation as seller forever. who will give personal info to such idiot. info will be deleted and he banned.<br /><br />&nbsp;if you want to find him and deal with him, you just looking to make troubles for yourself.

				Buy a prepaid phone with cash and call his ISP using that if you&#039;re afraid of the legal consequences. There are tons of sites where you can find ISPs based on IP addresses alone.
