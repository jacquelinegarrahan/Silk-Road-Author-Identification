				This is a throw away account&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I am not new to the road or the forums and am comfortable enough security wise as a buyer.<br /><br />Looking at domestic prices of bush weed, indoor, mdma and benzo&#039;s is laughable!<br /><br />Hoping to set up in a couple months and not rush things and be half arsed!<br /><br />Now the questions<br /><br />1)&nbsp; I have ordered an android tablet from overseas&nbsp; that will be dedicated to solely vending on SR, can anyone link me to tutroials to setting these up safely or know how to?&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Can these tablets be wiped of the Android OS and just run linux and have PGP/TOR, True Crypt &amp; wifi on it?<br /><br />3)&nbsp; Fingerprints I&#039;m confident in being able to cover up, but DNA concerns me!&nbsp; If you were charged with a serious crime and had to provide a DNA sample to the police but you spent X amount of months on bail only to have the charges dropped at committal, would this DNA still have been processed and added to the Australian database?<br /><br />Signing off, probably forever under this account<br /><br />Peace all
