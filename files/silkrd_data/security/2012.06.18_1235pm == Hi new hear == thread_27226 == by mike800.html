				As long as you encrypt your messages, buy your bitcoins anonymously and only purchase from reputable vendors you should be fine. I recommend keeping all of your Tor related shit on a flash drive/SD card and if shit hits the fan just keep your mouth shut until you get a lawyer.

				The short answer is probably &#039;yes,&#039; but they&#039;d have to go to a hell of a lot of trouble to do it, narrowing down your Tor address and all...you have to ask yourself &quot;Are you that important?&quot;&nbsp; But mostly we don&#039;t know...I mean, Tor is farily safe, and as was said, encrypt everything...I&#039;d do two things, for starts, one is to investigate and start using Tails: https://tails.boum.org/ <br /><br />Then, if you really want to do it right...go to the Security sub forum here, and just read from the beginning...you can kind of skim it in a couple of hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the early days, and since, we&#039;ve gone over all this, all the questions, all the concerns, and all the solutions...rather than have one of us spend pages, it would be better you pay the same dues we&#039;ve all had to pay, by learning from others.&nbsp; There are many ways to protect yourself, depending on how much work you want to put into it, but it is all covered in this subforum: Security.<br /><br />Then if you&#039;ve downloaded Tails -- or look into Liberte Linux, you might prefer that--you&#039;ll have other questions, which most here are glad to answer.&nbsp; Best wishes...
