				Maybe this thread should be under packaging but I think security wise it makes sense here too but please feel free to move.<br /><br />I&#039;ve received quite a few packages from SR in the months that I&#039;ve been here.&nbsp; The stealth of some packages has baffled me, as in I&#039;ve spent 10 minutes or so unwrapping and FINDING the actual contents of my order.&nbsp; Other packages were nothing more than a box with pills taped to the bottom.&nbsp; My concern is that sometimes I receive a package from a vendor that is obviously using a fake company name or something like that as the return address but the package doesn&#039;t seem to fit with what you would expect to be receiving from a company like that.<br /><br />For example without going into specifics; one time I received a package from a computer company in a priority envelope but when I picked it up it rattled, and it was obvious to me that there was some sort of food contained inside by the consistency and sound of the contents of the package.&nbsp; Now maybe the average postal employee isn&#039;t thinking about the contents of a package or even looking to see what kind of company it&#039;s coming from but I know if it was me I&#039;d be somewhat suspicious.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just being paranoid here but wouldn&#039;t it make sense to think about the total &#039;look and feel&#039; of your packaging and return address when sending anything from SR?<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m just looking for feedback here am I being paranoid?&nbsp; Or would it make sense to stay away from vendors that send me packages like this in order to not arouse suspicion from postal workers since I do order on a pretty regular basis?
