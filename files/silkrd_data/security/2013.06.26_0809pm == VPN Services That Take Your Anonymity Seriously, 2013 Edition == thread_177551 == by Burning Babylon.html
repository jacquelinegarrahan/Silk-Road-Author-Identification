				This thread will be based on the article VPN Services That Take Your Anonymity Seriously, 2013 Edition from TorrentFreak: https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/ Now I&#039;ve done some searching and there are plenty of VPN forum threads up, but they ask far too open ended questions to my liking. The scope of this thread will be all VPN providers in the TorrentFreak article and no others whatsoever, here they are sorted alphabetically:<br /><br />AirVPN: https://airvpn.org/<br />Anonine: https://www.anonine.com/en<br />BlackVPN: https://www.blackvpn.com/<br />BolehVPN: http://bolehvpn.net/<br />BTGuard: https://btguard.com/<br />Faceless.me: http://faceless.me/<br />Ipredator: https://ipredator.se/<br />IPVanish: http://www.ipvanish.com/<br />IVPN: http://www.ivpn.net/<br />Mullvad: https://mullvad.net/en/<br />NordVPN: http://www.nordvpn.com/<br />Privacy.io: https://privacy.io/<br />Private Internet Access: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/<br />PrivatVPN: https://www.privatvpn.se/en/<br />Proxy.sh: https://proxy.sh/<br />PRQ: http://www.prq.se/?p=tunnel&amp;intl=1<br />Torguard: http://torguard.net/<br />TorrentPrivacy: https://torrentprivacy.com/<br /><br />Of these 18 providers I will personally only consider those who accept Bitcoin as payment:<br /><br />AirVPN: https://airvpn.org/<br />BlackVPN: https://www.blackvpn.com/<br />BolehVPN: http://bolehvpn.net/<br />BTGuard: https://btguard.com/<br />Ipredator: https://ipredator.se/<br />IVPN: http://www.ivpn.net/<br />Mullvad: https://mullvad.net/en/<br />Private Internet Access: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/<br />Proxy.sh: https://proxy.sh/<br />PRQ: http://www.prq.se/?p=tunnel&amp;intl=1<br />Torguard: http://torguard.net/<br /><br />So we&#039;re down to 11 providers now, for the next column I will link any information from http://www.bestvpn.com/ and http://www.bestvpnservice.com/<br /><br />AirVPN: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/4486/airvpn-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/97/air-vpn.html<br />BlackVPN: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/6346/blackvpn-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/69/black-vpn.html<br />BolehVPN: N/A | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/156/boleh-vpn.html<br />BTGuard: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/3563/btguard-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/262/btguard.html<br />Ipredator: N/A | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/126/ipredator.html<br />IVPN: N/A | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/62/ivpn.html<br />Mullvad: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/4565/mullvad-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/181/mullvad-vpn.html<br />Private Internet Access: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/3711/private-internet-access-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/139/private-internet-access-vpn.html<br />Proxy.sh: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/5544/proxy-sh-review/ | N/A<br />PRQ: N/A | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/157/prq-vpn.html<br />Torguard: http://www.bestvpn.com/blog/3645/torguard-review/ | http://www.bestvpnservice.com/providers/246/tor-guard.html<br /><br />I have no experience with any of these so I&#039;m going to do some reading and come back to this thread when I&#039;ve decided, hopefully a few can chime in with experiences with some of these providers before that. :)

				I have my own dedicated server so I just set up OpenVPN on there so I know 100% that it&#039;s secure.<br /><br />I&#039;d take payments for it, but unfortunately I can&#039;t give any of you access because you&#039;d have my IP address, from that you could request who owns it from the hosting company (with a warrant) and bam, I&#039;m fucked (I&#039;m a vendor).

				Sk0rt... if you own the VPN, where is your plausible deniability?<br />I presume it&#039;s offsite, so do you anonymously rent a server?<br /><br />It&#039;s not the nature of VPN that gives you extra security over TOR, it&#039;s the fact that you&#039;re obscuring TOR access from an ISP that would be willing to work with LE to track you down. (let&#039;s say, by giving LE a list of IP&#039;s that regularly use TOR, how often, and for how long.)&nbsp; Heck they don&#039;t even need a warrant for that part, they only need one to resolve those IPs into names.<br /><br />If you VPN from one PC to another, and you own both, there is no obscurity except for what TOR does for you naturally.

				I actually have used PrivateInternetAccess for torrenting and accessing TOR. Paying with bitcoins was fairly easy. I did some research a while back and determined that they were the best option for me. I have to say I am fairly impressed with the service. You can connect to a wide variety of servers in the US and Canada, and it doesn&#039;t slow down my internet at all. I&#039;m not sure what other information you may want, so feel free to ask questions and hopefully I&#039;ll be able to answer them&nbsp; 8).

				Quick question. To what extent does PIA hide you? Downloading files and browsing tor, yeah. If I wanted to buy postage for shipments with a gift card how secure am I as long as the little green fat man in the corner is bright green? Can I threaten political figures? <br /><br />Also while we are on the topic of PIA, whats the opinion on VPN kill switch and DNS Leak Protection that is offered in the settings

				I feel reassured after reading many of these posts that I did indeed make the right decision when after researching several VPN services, I decided to go with PrivateInternetAccess.&nbsp; Paid for a year in BTC a couple of months ago, and have been happy with them for the most part.&nbsp; Only thing, unlike what a couple of people mentioned where they said that it didn&#039;t slow down their browsing at all, unfortunately I&#039;ve not had that much luck.&nbsp; It definately slows down my Firefox on the clearnet as well as slows down already very slow TOR even more so.&nbsp; Still, I figure a little inconvenience is worth it for the extra layer of security....

				Well firs of all thanks to the OP for the list very useful. However i have a question that may seem fairly basic. Im using Tails with a persistent volume, So it is of course on its own an operating system that forces everything to connect through tor anyway, Is a VPN reccommeded even though i am using tails? or is it for if you are using an OS like Linux or windows with the Tor browser bundle, even if it is on a USB.<br />Anyone know?<br /><br />Thanks all

These boxes are very sophisticated and they don’t just filter traffic by src, dst or port, they filter traffic by the content the packets carry.<br /><br />Since August 2011 Syrin regime applied the DPI and they start blocking OpenVPN – L2TP/IPSec and sometimes TOR&nbsp; connection , in order to not allow any user has a secure connections.<br /><br />Tor Action :<br /><br />Tor as one of the main anonymity providers , DPI was able to block its traffic over the “Digital fingerprint of it’s traffic “<br /><br />Tor said “ An increasing number of censoring countries are using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to classify Internet traffic flows by protocol. While Tor uses bridge relays to get around a censor that blocks by IP address, the censor can use DPI to recognize and filter Tor traffic flows even when they connect to unexpected IP addresses. “<br /><br />In response to that, Tor deployed a technology called Pluggable Transports which it can obfuscate the traffic to looks like “nothing!” that will drive the DPI evil boxes to go Crazy!

				Posted today on torblog:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Welcome to the eighth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the great Tor community.<br />Future of pluggable transports integration<br /><br />While David Fifield was busy updating the Pluggable Transports Bundle to match the “classic” bundle version 0.2.4.16-beta-1, several discussions took place on how to better integrate pluggable transports in the future.<br /><br />bastik opened #9444, pointing out that “currently TBB with Pluggable Transports are build separately, thus lagging behind”. Having two separate bundles is also a long standing usability issue, as often users have tried to add “obfs” bridges to their normal TBB.<br /><br />Mike Perry is fully aware of the issue and stated in the discussion that his “long term goal is to try to cram all of the pluggable transports into The One True Bundle.”<br /><br />This will require modifications to the new “Tor Launcher” component of the TBB 3.x series in order to allow users to select the bridges and pluggable transports they wish to use. Compromises might be needed on how users should input bridges. BridgeDB recently stopped having the “bridge” keyword in front of the addresses it replies with as Vidalia would not understand it. Mike Perry was thinking in exactly the opposite direction: “take bridge lines directly from bridgedb […] verifying only that they start with ‘bridge’”. Maybe the transition could be easier if Florian Stinglmayr’s patch to Vidalia was merged so that current bundles would ignore the “bridge” keyword when entering bridges.<br /><br />In any case, Mike wants to solve these issues “before we release as beta/stable, to minimize user confusion.”<br /><br />Another tricky part of the “One True Bundle” solution is the bundle size, making it harder to circumvent download restrictions through email. But, as Mike said, “even if they don’t, we’ll probably have to find some other solution anyway for gettor, because the intersection of gettor users and PT users is probably high.”<br />Extended ORPort land in tor 0.2.5<br /><br />After more than a year and a half in the making, the Extended ORPort mechanism has been merged by Nick Mathewson into the tor master branch. This will allow pluggable transport proxies to exchange arbitrary operational information and metadata with tor clients and bridges.<br /><br />Such plumbing was needed in order to make some pluggable transports easier to use or to allow Tor to gather more data about the state of the transports used.<br /><br />obfsproxy has supported this new communication channel for a little while and was only waiting for tor to catch up. George Kadianakis thus asked obfsbridge operators to upgrade their tor to git master to enable client statistics.<br /><br />Once they do, their bridges will send statistics on users per transport to the bridge authority, and they will be published on metrics.torproject.org. This helps track deployment of pluggable transports in the future.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Also anything that works well with tails is a plus.<br /><br />Im sort of leaning towards earthVPN, however Im not sure, They seem to be very good, cheap and proffesional all in the one package.

				https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=27354<br /><br />this is all i could find about setting up tor on a router. this seems to be the optimal way of doing things cause theres absolutely no way you could be deamonynized under this setup and you&#039;d get persistent entry guards if u were using a live os and u&#039;d be able to run as a relay 24/7 masking your traffic/connection patterns and helping the network. your nfo could still get jacked though if u get hacked.

First those that simply said no, just offered their dedicated IP addresses in one country only or those I found no simple way of contacting:<br /><br />AirVPN: https://airvpn.org ( Answer: We&#039;re sorry, we do not offer such a service. )<br />BlackVPN: https://www.blackvpn.com ( Answer: currently we don&#039;t offer static IPs on any servers as we believe that compromises your anonymity )<br />BTGuard: https://btguard.com ( Answer: We only offer dynamic Ip addresses.&nbsp; )<br />EarthVPN: http://www.earthvpn.com ( Answer: Thank you for your interest.We will offer dedicated IP with port forwarding enabled soon. )<br />Ipredator: https://ipredator.se ( Only Contact is via IRC. )<br />IVPN: http://www.ivpn.net ( Answer: No, we use shared IP&#039;s to ensure sufficient interface crowding on the servers. )<br />Mullvad: https://mullvad.net/en ( Answer: No, sorry.

You will need to open a support ticket to notify us that you have already made the payment for the normal 180 days package.<br />3) Once we received the ticket, we will proceed to setup the dedicated IP for you and this will be done within 24 hours upon receiving the ticket.

				Boys an girls<br /><br />Be very careful using any of these services - some run very loose operations, some are probably run by LE. Some are OK but very hard to know which is which.<br /><br />Use them as a layer in your onion skin but do not rely on them alone for anonymity or confidentiality - i.e. assume they are compromised when you use them and take steps accordingly then all will be OK.<br /><br />

This does not apply to hidden service bound traffic such as .onion sites (we trust!)<br /><br />A VPN can have a part to play - just don&#039;t rely on it completely. So perhaps establish VPN from your endpoint and then once it is up, bring TOR up on top of it. I don&#039;t think that buys you much in general but it might hide TOR traffic from your immediate ISP if that were beneficial. If the VPN is compromised then impact is significantly reduced as all they can see is your encrypted TOR traffic.<br /><br />If you exited the VPN into a shared IP address (e.g. shared with the other VPN users) then again that buys you some benefit in the form of noise in which to hide.<br /><br />I do use a VPN myself dependent on where I physically am but that is usually to allow me to tunnel back to a known (semi trusted) network and from there I go back on to the Internet rather than connect directly to Internet services from a &#039;roaming&#039; network such as 3G/GPRS or wireless hotspots etc. Arguably however this may end up reducing my anonymity but it does increase the confidentiality of my shit to prying eyes in the Cellular provider or wi-fi hotspot operator. Point is that is my VPN I run it - not some unknown third party. (OpenVPN)<br /><br />An update to the post but probably something to bear in mind - PPTP based VPNs are often not very strong and an adversary who is able to monitor the initial key exchange can, if they choose to expend some resource (not too much), gain access to your plaintext traffic. Assuming your passphrase doesn&#039;t change then they only need to do this once. This is because most PPTP VPNs use MSCHAP or similar for authentication which is not that strong.<br /><br />So if you do have a VPN that you rely on and it is of the PPTP variety then ensure you use a stronger authentication mechanism such as EAP-TLS. WIndows and Linux both support this - just depends on your VPN provider as to whether they do. Better though to use a VPN based on IPSec or SSL VPN (Like OpenVPN)<br /><br /><br />

This does not apply to hidden service bound traffic such as .onion sites (we trust!)<br /><br />A VPN can have a part to play - just don&#039;t rely on it completely. So perhaps establish VPN from your endpoint and then once it is up, bring TOR up on top of it. I don&#039;t think that buys you much in general but it might hide TOR traffic from your immediate ISP if that were beneficial. If the VPN is compromised then impact is significantly reduced as all they can see is your encrypted TOR traffic.<br /><br />If you exited the VPN into a shared IP address (e.g. shared with the other VPN users) then again that buys you some benefit in the form of noise in which to hide.<br /><br />I do use a VPN myself dependent on where I physically am but that is usually to allow me to tunnel back to a known (semi trusted) network and from there I go back on to the Internet rather than connect directly to Internet services from a &#039;roaming&#039; network such as 3G/GPRS or wireless hotspots etc. Arguably however this may end up reducing my anonymity but it does increase the confidentiality of my shit to prying eyes in the Cellular provider or wi-fi hotspot operator. Point is that is my VPN I run it - not some unknown third party. (OpenVPN)<br /><br />An update to the post but probably something to bear in mind - PPTP based VPNs are often not very strong and an adversary who is able to monitor the initial key exchange can, if they choose to expend some resource (not too much), gain access to your plaintext traffic. Assuming your passphrase doesn&#039;t change then they only need to do this once. This is because most PPTP VPNs use MSCHAP or similar for authentication which is not that strong.<br /><br />So if you do have a VPN that you rely on and it is of the PPTP variety then ensure you use a stronger authentication mechanism such as EAP-TLS. WIndows and Linux both support this - just depends on your VPN provider as to whether they do. Better though to use a VPN based on IPSec or SSL VPN (Like OpenVPN)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fantastic post my friend it was interesting to read.<br />Thanks for posting such a detailed response.<br />There is lots of good information here for everyone.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Vanquish

				PIA is a very reliable service... been using it for over a year and they just updated their encryption techniques<br /><br />&lt;clearweb&gt;&nbsp; https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/vpn-encryption<br /><br /><br /><br />PIA recommends the following setups for speed, safety and best trade-off performance.<br /><br />Data encryption AES-128 v AES-256 v Blowfish<br />Data authentication – SHA1 or SHA-256 <br />Handshake – RSA-2048 v RSA-3072 v RSA-4096<br /><br />- Default Recommended Protection — AES-128 / SHA1 / RSA-2048<br />- All Speed No Safety — None / None / ECC-256k1<br />- Maximum Protection — AES-256 / SHA256 / RSA-4096<br />- Risky Business — AES-128 / None / RSA-2048<br /><br />Lee says that PIA have included the extra options for those who want to feel extra secure or may want to experiment a little more with cryptography. He adds that for those looking for the ultimate in protection, frequent changes of setup within the client could lead to an almost impossible situation for would-be attackers.<br /><br />“With control of one’s level of encryption, even if someone were utilizing advanced alien technology, they would have a tough time if you changed your encryption settings every time you connect. But we recommend choosing the encryption strength/mode you desire and sticking with it,” Lee concludes.<br />
