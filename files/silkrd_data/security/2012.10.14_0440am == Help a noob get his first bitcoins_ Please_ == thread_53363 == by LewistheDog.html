				I&#039;m not sure how to actually purchase bitcoins. I have the bitcoin program and a mtgox account, but I can&#039;t figure out how to actually buy bitcoins. I&#039;m in the U.S.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked for an updated beginners guide, but could not find one. Perhaps someone could point me to that as well?&nbsp;

				this was posted originally by shroomister or sum shit like that best way ever!! if you usa otherwise idk what to tell u homes<br /><br />HOWTO:<br /><br />1) Go to bitinstant - choose &quot;Major Bank Branch&quot; ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Bitcoin address&quot;<br /><br />2) Get your self an instawallet or something similar. And BOOK MARK IT. you lose the link. you lose your $<br /><br />3) Create some RANDOM ASS Tormail email.<br /><br />4) Go back to bitinstant and walk through the process. You will need your instawallet bitcoin address. Use your random Tormail email address.<br /><br />5) Follow the site through to the &quot;trustcash&quot; site and continue. Use your real localish zipcode. you are going to have to actually drive to the bank.<br /><br />6) Do NOT put a real name when the Trust Cash website asks, but dont put anything silly either. (The paper work you are going to take the bank will not have ANY name on it anyway)<br /><br />7) Drive to the closest branch that Trust Cash points you to. No reason to drive a 1000 miles to a bank. Remember - you aren&#039;t doing anything illegal. Buying bitcoins is totally legit. (Yes I am sorry, you have to leave the house today)<br /><br />&nbsp;8) I would choose to go through the drive-thru at the bank personally myself. Make sure you print out the &quot;invoice&quot; that TrustCash prompted you to. (notice no personal info on the invoice.)<br /><br />9) Shoot the printed invoice and the cash over to the teller. (No ID!!!!!! It is not needed)<br /><br />10) Come home and check your Instawallet URL. Coins get there pretty quickly.<br /><br />11) Check the Tormail email address for any crap you may have gotten sent. Delete it.<br /><br />12) You now have your coins. You can do whatever you want with them. I personally would feel comfortable sending them directly to my SR wallet. The only &quot;connection&quot; you have to those bitcoins at this point is your face being recorded at the bank drive-thru (Go on a sunny day and wear a hat and sunglasses if you are that paranoid) Also you are just moving coins from one address to another. There is no Super Secret FBI Database of &quot;Black List&quot; Bitcoin addresses. Point being no one knows that this is a SR wallet. While all transactions are transparently viewable, there is nothing that looks suspicious to this very moment. IF you end up getting yourself in some type of trouble and one of your bitcoin addesses is &quot;looked into&quot; THEN the trail of breadcrumbs comes between you and SR.<br /><br />13) If you do not want to send your coins directly to SR at this point, then you can now choose to fog or launder them, and then send them to your SR wallet. (This will cost you between 1%-4% of your total)<br /><br />14)Profit!
