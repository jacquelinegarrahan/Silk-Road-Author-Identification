				okay so i was on my ipod messing around and was seeing if i could use bitinstant on there.<br />cool you can.<br />oh well i use my computer for it anyways<br />well i picked a place that was closed today to do my transaction. so i went somewhere with wifi<br />and used bitinstant on my ipod did all the info<br />now i also since i dont carry around my instawallet address with me. i went onto instawallet on my ipod.<br />this made a new wallet which i have bookmarked and havent even closed since opening it.<br />so i copied/pasted the address into bitinstant and went on to complete the transaction.<br />of course i fucked up and in the notifcation email i did a .com instead of a .org for my tormail address... so i wont get any notifications<br />on the order. ive been refreshing the wallet every 10 minutes or so and still nothing has shown up :\<br />someone calm me down! lol<br /><br />its been about 1 hour 45 min since i did this..it usually NEVER takes this long to get my btc. and i have used this location before<br />and it was in my wallet by the time i get home..<br />i have since typed out the URL of the ipod-wallet onto my browser and its the same address.<br />so now im just waiting on there<br />could it be bitinstant taking a LONG time?

				Yes it could...but then again they do say 1 hour or less right? <br /><br />Did u use the same transaction code for a new transaction? I made that mistake once, thinking it ws the same for each one. <br />Email support.
