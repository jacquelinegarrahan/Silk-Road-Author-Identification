				I want to buy BitCoins for the first time. <br /><br />I created a Tor Mail account so I can receive my BitCoins there.<br /><br />Then I went to BitInstant and set up an order for the BitCoins to be delivered via email.<br /><br />I never received the confirmation email at my Tor Mail account, so I&#039;m hesitant to fund my BitCoin order.<br /><br />In fact, I can&#039;t seem to receive any incoming messages at my Tor Mail account. Is anyone else having this problem? Is there a better anonymous email service that I can use with Tor?

				No, the BitCoin vendor is BitInstant. <br /><br />The delivery method I want to use is email and I want to receive them at my Tor Mail account for anonymity purposes.

				biteme: I&#039;ve been having the same problem all day today with one of my tormail accounts. Been waiting for btc confirmations and other important email and got none of it all day long!!! I still haven&#039;t had a chance to test with another tormail account, but interesting to hear your having the same problem.

				Oh, good. I mean it&#039;s not good, but nice to know that I&#039;m not alone. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong!<br /><br />I did another order and this time used a Mailinator.com address. I never got an order confirmation email from BitInstant, but I did get a status update email after I sent the funds. Maybe BitInstant has issues with sending the order confirmations as emails, but it&#039;s not so much of a problem since I got the details in a PDF when I placed the order.<br /><br />I decided to send the BitCoins directly to my SR account this time. I should know soon if it all worked.<br /><br />The hardest part of this was dealing with the MoneyGram people on the phone at the Vcom machine. They wanted my name, address and phone number. I was standing inside a 7-11 at the time with people around me.

				I still haven&#039;t received an email from bitinstant or coinapult about an order placed hours ago? Usually this happens fairly quickly is anyone else having trouble with this?

				Sometimes there can be delays through the system and today seems to be one of those days.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t received anything for more than 12 hours and I know there have been things sent since then.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll turn up eventually.<br />

				Thanks to all of you folks for helping out this noob! I&#039;m getting the hang of things now. I figured out how to use TORwallet to put an extra layer of security between my cash, BTC, and SR account. Feeling fine about it and finally have some credits to use in the marketplace. I&#039;m still not getting my incoming messages in Tor Mail yet but I did find a workaround. I really appreciate everyone&#039;s hospitality and hope I can repay the favors sometime in the future.

				Nope, I still have no mail in any tormail accounts, after 24 hours. I also haven&#039;t heard back from the tormail admin whom I wrote about 16 hours ago. Hopefully all is well and the mail spool will keep incoming messages stored until problems are worked out. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear if anyone else has got mail at their tormail accounts?

				i am also having the same problem. I deposited money about a couple hours ago and still havent received an email. I messaged bitinstant about it. So the problem is that tormail is not receiving incoming messages? Do you think bitinstant could send another bitcoin email link to a different email thats not tormail?

				Chiming in to let everyone know I&#039;m having the same issues. Didn&#039;t get a Bitinstant confirmation email, nor a Coinapult email. Tested the @tormail.org account by sending an email from an external address and it still hasn&#039;t arrived, so clearly something is not working properly.<br /><br />Coinapult has a contact form on their site. If you don&#039;t want to wait out this problem, you might be able to get them to send to an alternate email.

				Yep, looks to be working fine now. I got an email from Mt. Gox. Actually feeling kinda lucky that the delay happened because I learned more about Mt. Gox and decided against using it. Sometimes things seem to happen for a reason!<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone for being so helpful.
