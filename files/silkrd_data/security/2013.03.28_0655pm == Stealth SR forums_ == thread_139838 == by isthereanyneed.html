				What do you guys and girls think of this............?<br /><br />A section in the forums that is only accessible if you are an SR member with a proven track record (good/high stats)<br /><br />This potentially keeps the majority of LE out and keeps questions and answers relevant and accurate.<br /><br />Just a thought....................:)

				Over my time on SR I have seen a thread like this a few times.<br />It would be to hard to screen people and LE could easily create an account act like one of us, than get in.<br />In reality we do have one forum that I can almost guarantee is without LE. The vendor forum.

Like you said, LE could easily create multiple accounts to build up feedback for themselves then when they have the prerequisites, ask a mod to join the vendor forum.<br /><br />LE are trained in undercover infiltration.

				That&#039;s why I said almost.<br /><br />The only way to get accepted to the vendor forum is by selling a certain amount of drugs. Is it not true that LE cannot sell drugs? They can trap you by pretending to, but if people say they recieved product than it cant be LE?

				What I am saying is LE may have many buying accounts that they could use to purchase shill products from their own LE vending account, building up false positive feedback to gain entry to the vendor forum.<br /><br />It would be best not to give sensitive information to anyone at all, because anyone on here could be LE.

				I think it&#039;s most likely that there isn&#039;t LE is the vendor forums but that&#039;s just me generally speaking. I also think there&#039;s a lot more sensitive information in the vendor forums as well.&nbsp; But always act as if LE is here watching. Just don&#039;t send out any sensitive information unencrypted.
