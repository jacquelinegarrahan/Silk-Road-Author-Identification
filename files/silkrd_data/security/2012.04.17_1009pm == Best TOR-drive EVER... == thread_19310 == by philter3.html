				Just a word in the ear of all the toy-lovers amongst us.. I just got myself a Corsair &quot;Survivor&quot; model USB 3.0 (32 GB) flash drive.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006B7R8ZG/<br /><br />This drive was purchased to be my TOR/Liberte/Naughty-bits drive. I got it because I figured.. while it would be bulky (for reasons I will get to in a second) I needed to take my security very seriously.<br /><br />&nbsp;The &quot;Survivor&quot; model is aptly named. It is a USB flash drive that is housed inside a &quot;Can&quot; type lining. <br />The aluminium casing screws into the capside where the drive extends from. The entire assembly is WATERPROOF (to like 200 meters or something) and you could back a car over it without damaging the drive.<br />&nbsp;More importantly.. the waterproof part means it can go with you on adventures involving water, and (I thought) even on a neckchain in the shower if you were sleeping over and cleaning up in a non-secure location.<br /><br />&nbsp;To my great surprise and pleasure.. my expectations about the size and bulk of the drive were totally WRONG. This thing is TINY. It is not quite as small as a tube of chapstick.. but it&#039;s pretty close. About the size of a Pez dispenser. Has the integral loop in the cap so it can be put on a necklace.<br /><br />&nbsp;All in all.. this is my new ultra secure dream TOR-drive. Add a nice long female-to-male USB cable and it will never have to leave my neck. It&#039;s that small and unobtrusive. The stickers in the pictures easily pull off.. and it can be painted also (which I will do to customize it for fun).<br /><br />&nbsp;All in all.. if you want a TOR/Liberte drive you keep on you at all times.. this one is an EXCELLENT choice.
