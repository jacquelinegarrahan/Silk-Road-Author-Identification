				So it is evident that Limetless has nothing better to do than hang around the forums 16/24hrs and can&nbsp; rack up the post count pretty fucking quick, But who decided his high post count and lack of a social life makes him a good candidate to be a MOD? Like the guy has been here for 2 months, does nothing but make really bad remarks regarding the police(something they themselves often do when undercover), worst of all he is claiming he is qualified to teach vendors on how to launder their funds using his &quot;system&quot;.<br />Anyone who shares any details of their profits or current laundering techniques with this guy is crazy, even more crazy are the people who are laundering their profits using his system. This is the exact kind of sting operation LEO would set up to try and track vendor profits.<br /><br />Has this place degraded so much that they really need staff that have only been here for a couple of months?

				Knew some prick would say something like this.<br /><br />Actually, Ido have a pretty good social life and I work online IRL so I have plenty of time to be here as well and yeah, I am qualified to teach ML. None of my clients give any of their details so how would that work then you jumped up little prick. <br /><br />What makes me laugh is that you don&#039;t even have the balls to say this with your real account, despite the fact you would never have to say it to my face. Someone is a fag aren&#039;t they? <br /><br />Oh and before you say &quot;Yeah, he will probably close this thread&quot;...nah I wont. We can talk this through all fucking day.

I can put my seal of approval on all the advice he has given - he rightly charges a consultancy fee when engaging in more in depth methods of laundering proceeds as would I or any of you if/when you have a skill to ply. Indeed I would be much MORE suspicious if he gave this advice away for free.<br /><br />Considering you created a new account just for the purpose of slating our newest Moderator I can only conclude that if you used your real user name it would be revealed either that you&#039;ve no experience of SR and therefore wouldn&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about or that you have a vested interest in seeing of a rival.<br /><br />As for being a loser with no social life, what does this kind of behaviour and comments say about you? If you think you can do better, why not use your real account, contact the Admins and ask them for a shot?<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

What does that say about you son? Says you don&#039;t have a spine.<br /><br />If I&#039;m a shit mod then the end result is that my trial is negative and I don&#039;t get to stay on the team. If I&#039;m a decent one I get a permanent spot. <br /><br />Oh and LOL at the fact you are spreading shit about my ML consultations, if you knew what system I use you wouldn&#039;t be saying shit. You just don&#039;t like that I charge for it. <br /><br />Closing statement - Jog the fuck on and only think about coming back if you can talk to me from your REAL account. Bitch.

				To the op saying about limit being on here 16 hrs a day well that&#039;s exactly why the fuck they want him!&nbsp; They dont want a mod that&#039;s one here for 15 mins I know that lol.&nbsp; And what the fuck does his IRL dealings have to do with being a mod on a forum ???&nbsp; Please man up and use your real name.&nbsp; I would of given you plus 1 just for being a man whether I agreed with U or not.&nbsp; You will never see me posting on a throw away acct.&nbsp; The only reason to do that is because the person commenting thinks what he or she is typing is wrong or why would they not use there real name?<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Limitless&nbsp; Razer buck fifty his ass

				No, not yet but I am tempted to give it a try at some point. I am awful for just having one more cheeky line before I put it away so that could help quite a bit.<br />I am giving the old neuro receptors a bit of a holiday at the moment though, got some nice hash a while ago and have been smoking that a chilling out with a book in the evenings.

				As an aside.. if the natives are restless and the waters are troubled it is often best to ACT somehow.. though not in any way that is likely to substantially fuck things up if it goes wildly awry.<br /><br />Appointing a new mod from the ranks and letting them run amok being active is a good way to &quot;do something&quot; without having to &quot;do something TOO substantial&quot;.. <br /><br />&quot;Ruling a kingdom is like cooking a very small fish&quot;

				One Month MOD, limetless deserve to be a mod there, he (or she) is a precious person to that community and his (her) posts are smart and straight to the point. You are obviously a jealous troll with you&#039;re fucking 2 posts, limetless has over 1500 posts under the hood. I am a member of the silk road for three months and i have only around 30 posts but i try to be a good member of that community and i really love the road. Maybe Limetless is a member for a couple of months too but 1500+ posts is something by itself. Just my 2 cents..

				Well, the trolls dislike him and he dislikes the trolls, so it seems like a win-win scenario for him to be equipped with a banhammer.<br /><br />On the other hand to put the Condom of Responsibility onto the Boner of Moderation, take care that you are not slyly manipulated by other forum members into censoring somebody who has something useful to say, even if people don&#039;t particularly like what they are hearing. This can often be a problem it seems with new posters with little reputation popping up saying things under ambiguous circumstances, sometimes it&#039;s hard to distinguish between noise and signal.

I would advise you to measure twice, cut once.<br /><br />After all, if LE truly wishes to invade our boards, they are more likely to be long term residents mixing dangerous lies with frequently repeated truths to avoid detection. They are also likely to gang up on other members to produce an illusion of consensus. It is fine to make snap decisions against our recent round of exchange service scammers, since there can never be any utility in allowing them credibility. But &#039;political discussions&#039; are different, it&#039;s often better to cool your heels before working out what to do. So remember that is there no such thing as consensus, this is not a democracy or a choir, it is a market. <br /><br />As for racists, ad hom attacks on people/assholes (see a thread of a guy inquiring about shipping to Turkey for an example), I think the threat of 3 strikes enforcement is optimal for them.
