				i guess this is a pretty newb-ish question but i actually have been researching which is why i am even more confused.&nbsp; <br /><br />usually i buy btc from sugar mama on sr...takes a few days but i feel safe using this method and have been for months.&nbsp; <br />in the interim while SR is down i have been trying to figure out the best alternative to buying coins on SR so that when it does come back I will already have my funds and not have to wait extra since sugarmama will inevitably be backed up &amp; overwhelmed.&nbsp; <br /><br />so far it seems the best options are coinbase or bitinstant but both seem to have a bunch of negatives. (unfortunately there are no localbitcoin sellers in my area) <br />as far as coinbase goes... i am hesitant to hook up my bank account.&nbsp; it also appears it will take 4 days to get coins with a daily limit of $100 which sucks.&nbsp; Ive read some reports of people being ripped off on bitcointalk but otherwise people seem ok with this company.<br /><br />as for bitinstant it all seemed legit up until recently there are many complaints being written about them...people not getting their money or not the full amount, shitty customer service, etc. I am super socially awkward so the whole moneygram thing is making me nervous too.&nbsp; most of the newbie &quot;how to get bitcoins&quot; posts recommend this method but seems like these posts are old and the updates say it is no longer a good choice?<br /><br />so between these forums and bitcointalk I haven&#039;t come across anything i feel is the best method so I am looking for advice from you guys.&nbsp; Have you used either of these services recently? what was the experience like? how long did it take?&nbsp; what other options am i not aware of here?<br />i just need some reassurance that i&#039;m not going to do something unsafe or lose my money.<br /><br />generally i would just be patient but circumstances are causing me to need to prepare myself quicker this time around &amp; of course it coincides with this douchebag attack. <br /><br />any help/advice is appreciated

				I used bitinstant last week, and I had to go to a check cashing place and pay through &quot;cashpayment.com&quot;.<br /><br />I gave the lady the instructions, she gave me my receipt.&nbsp; She did ask for my name, but I gave her a fake.&nbsp; Within 2 hours, I had my coins.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t loose too much during the exchange, but I miss BST.&nbsp; I think CIM is the way to go with them now.<br /><br />
