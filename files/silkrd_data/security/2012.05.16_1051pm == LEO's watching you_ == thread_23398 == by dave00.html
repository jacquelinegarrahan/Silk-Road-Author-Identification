				They&#039;ll most likely follow you so the next time you&#039;re going to your PO box or wherever your drop is at just drive there normally but before you get there make a full circle around a block and if a car still follows you after making a complete circle then most likely you&#039;re being watched.

				There&#039;s always the approach of being a concerned citizen for your area and talking to them.<br /><br />If they have legitimate work to do, they&#039;ll have enough proof. Remember, it&#039;s not uncommon for concerned neighbors to question suspicious looking vehicles in their neighborhood. <br /><br />Either way<br />If they&#039;re not cops: They pass your test and seem legitimate and do work.<br />If they are cops: Well I mean they&#039;re watching you for a reason, being a concerned citizen isn&#039;t going to make them more suspicious of you.

				If your worried about your mail being watched, send YOURSELF a controlled delivery.&nbsp; In other words, mail yourself a package, something legitimate but wrap it so you know if it was &quot;inspected&quot;&nbsp; There are a bunch of ways to make sure that if someone examined your package that you would know it had been tampered with.&nbsp; The easiest way is to tape the crap out of a chocolate bar or other harmless item and in order for anyone to really inspect it they are going to have to rip the tape and then resend it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

One of these guy, who previously texted with perfect spelling and grammar, is now making easy typos for some reason and asking me to send him a 10strip... The fuck?

				The driving around the nlock thing doesnt work. Saw a couple shows on tv (those dea shows) where they take 3 cars to follow you. Basically when you make a turn the car following goes strait and tells another car where you turned at. That second car follows you until you turn and calls radios the third car. And they dont follow right behind you, they stay a couple cars back. DEA has perfected this skill. And they say they use colors which experimentaly people dont notice, like off green and dark brown. So even if the same car followed you twice you would notice the red civilian car that has nothing to do with following you and ignore the average dark green car that has been following you from 2 cars back.<br /><br />Just a heads up.

				Depends what he ordered i guess. If it was bulk it might be worth it too them (NOT TRYING TO SCARE ANYBODY OUT OF BUYING BULK!! I havent had one bad bulk transaction and I&#039;ve ordered lots) . And I dont think it would be that expensive. Think about it. They&#039;re all on salary so the extra hours arnt anything. They would only need one person to stakeout and when that person leaves they follow, call the other 2 cars, and the three of them take turns following you for an hour. I think people think it costs alot for LEO to do a stakeout but it really doesnt. Most LEO make less than 50K a year so doing a week long stakeout would only cost the city $3000 (assuming 3 people taking shifts). That seems pretty cheap when the person orders $5000 worth of product. AND if they do bust somebody its good publicity for the city so citizens will thank the city for spending $3000 to take a dealer off the street.<br /><br />I might have gone on circles on that response but it makes sense in my head haha.

				Some times it is the little man who gets small orders the LEOs go after. That is usually only the case though if you&nbsp; are connected in some way to the&nbsp; big wig who is making all the money and doing all the selling. Then they will use you and try and threaten to send you to prison or&nbsp; do whatever else to get you to snitch or work with them.&nbsp; Big buys little buys no one is safe. All one can do is try and prepare for every contingency and be as safe as possible. remember even if something might be 10 thousand to one or seems so crazy and not likely to happen that indeed it can and usually will. The odds of winning the lottery are&nbsp; millions and millions to 1 yet people win it every week.&nbsp; no matter how&nbsp; paranoid you may appear&nbsp; or how&nbsp; long the odds are of something happening&nbsp; make sure you got that base covered. There many many people in prison now&nbsp; &nbsp;because they said to themselves or their friends &quot;you know what the odds of that happening are?&quot;&nbsp; Don&#039;t be one of those people.&nbsp; be paranoid&nbsp; be safe and remember&nbsp; discretion is always the better part of valor.

				also don&#039;t be a creature of habit. meaning do not do everything the same way every time. like take the same route some where or&nbsp; have the same drop off. what ever.&nbsp; Also and this always surprises me among people I have met. DO NOT make your deals in real life in secluded areas or through car windows or in private spots. That is unless you really know and trust who you are buying from.&nbsp; If it is someone who is strictly a dealer and you have no bond of friendship or anything else ALWAYS meet in a restaurant and just sit down like you are having dinner and make the exchange under the table . Make sure it is a booth.&nbsp; this takes away the opportunity of you getting robbed or killed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also when you sit at the booth&nbsp; drop your stash on the floor&nbsp; &nbsp;by your feet and push it over to the other side. your buyer wont know it&#039;s there assuming you get there 15 20 mins before the scheduled meeting and&nbsp; that way&nbsp; if it&#039;s a bust&nbsp; they cant bust you with possession.&nbsp; attorney can argue the fact the dope was on the floor in the restaurant. it could have been anyone&#039;s. I know people who&nbsp; drive across town with pills and wrap them up and put them in their pocket the entire trip across town.&nbsp; ALWAYS keep pills unwrapped and in your hand&nbsp; ready to swallow should you get&nbsp; pulled over. keep a constant eye in your mirrors at train stops and red lights.&nbsp; they will run up on you like a ninja and u not even know it. . this is assuming its a eatable amount without OD&#039;ing and if its a large amount say 100 pills&nbsp; then by god&nbsp; take ten at a time each trip for ten trips. YES that&#039;s what I do. paranoid yes&nbsp; but I wont get pulled over and found with pills.&nbsp; believe that. If&nbsp; you think some precautions are just way overboard you keep on thinking that. I just hope you are not one of the ones laying in a cell one night saying to yourself &#039;why didn&#039;t I do that?&quot; an hr or so of hassle and extra gas and&nbsp; trouble is worth my peace of mind. you must ask yourself if it is yours.

				Rule no.1 OP, trust your instincts. If you think you&#039;re being watched, clean up shop, stash your shit, and wait to see what the score is. If you have a garden at the back that is out of view, buy a small waterproof safe online, dig up a hole in your garden and stash your shit in the safe in there.

				Wow there are some paranoid shits in this thread, most drug busts are during the transport of the drugs, pulled over for speeding, expired tags, broken headlight etc, couldn&#039;t wait to get home so they already used the product and are 4 guys nodding out in a Nissan in a gas station parking lot, shit like like.<br /><br />Unless you have deals going down at your place, ie different cars and different people constantly pulling up and then leaving a few minutes later, or you had a large order that you&#039;ve never received, then I wouldn&#039;t waste any more time thinking the LE are staking out your house.<br /><br />If there&#039;s a suspicious car or van parked around, go over to it, talk to the guys, don&#039;t sit there shitting your pants peeking through the blinds like a vagina.

				With the plate tracking technology recently discussed in another thread they don&#039;t even need to follow you. Always take different routes if you are making drops or accessing any &#039;sensitive&#039; locations. NEVER bring your cell phone(s) with you when doing so (or at least take the batteries out). I do believe installing GPS tracker&#039;s on cars was recently overturned, but I may be wrong, and I hear they are still doing it regardless. You can simply use public transportation to avoid this if you like. Have a friend do some &quot;real-world&quot; recon on any incoming/outgoing drops or other &#039;sensitive&#039; locations to keep an eye out for new camera&#039;s, strange vans parked nearby, ect as mentioned if ya wanna stay on the flip....errr....safe side.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />And use pre-paid, disposible phones and TEXT ONLY. Exchange digits using GPG online.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC<br /><br />

Depending on if it&#039;s high pitched or low pitched, you can detect your waves are under outside surveillance. Another thing I&#039;ve heard of is not clicks during the phone call itself, but also when you first place a call. <br /><br />Press &#039;Call&#039;, *click-click RIIIING, RIIIIING*

				first of all you should never be worried if your phone is tapped or not cause your phone is for personal stuff not business.&nbsp; your car and your apartment is where you should be worried about wire taps.&nbsp;

				With the RICO Act they can very easily use the built-in microphone on your cell to listen in on you if they like, so phones are a concern. That&#039;s why I suggest text only on a burner. So vocal recognition software can&#039;t be used at least.&nbsp; It&#039;s how the took down that mafia crew about 10 years back. I would personally &quot;physically&quot; cut (or at least turn down) any audio input on your laptop as well as cover any built in webcam.<br /><br />That&#039;s just me tho. ;)<br /><br />

Was living in a small town, the PD had two dedicated drug officers. One night on the way to the neighborhood bar my friends and I noticed they were parked behind a bush across the street from the gas station on the only road through town. When we got to the bar EVERYONE was talking about it. Someone in a position to know told us they had a tip there was a big shipment of weed coming through that night. I walked to a phone a few blocks away and called in a report of two creepy looking suspicious characters parked in the shadows by the highway. They were gone within 15 minutes. Also, the dispatcher was not very good at controlling her laughter while we were on the phone&nbsp; ;D
