				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well first he pretended to be cops. Saying if i do not PAY bitcoins WELL ill copy and paste THEN THREATENED ME AND MY CHILDREN LIVES! EVEN THO I HAVE NONE NOT THE POINT! READ THIS ALL! MONITORS, SR ADMIMS SOMEONE DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />1st message<br />This is the last message I can write. They just said enough is enough. He<br />either does it and saves his ass or goes in with the rest. Good luck bro.<br />All the money in the world isn&#039;t worth it. This is Detective Roberts<br />again. You know your choices. You let me know if you&#039;ll pay back the<br />bitcoins or you&#039;ll spend your time. Anywhere from 10 years to life. It<br />just matters how our prosecutors do and how much information you give<br />away. So what is it? You have 15minutes to answer my question. If I don&#039;t get an answer in 15 minutes<br />we&#039;ll take that as meaning you want to keep the bitcoins that you will be<br />fined for anyways. 15 minutes starting now.<br />2nd message<br />But when your door is knocked open don&#039;t be surprised.<br />You don&#039;t have much time for your decision. Or your bitcoins.<br />Also just so you know a drug dealers children are fostered even if they<br />have a mother. In 99% of the cases the mother new about the situation and<br />that is enough to put the children in foster homes the rest of their<br />lives. I though you might want to know what my job consists of.<br />Also you are lucky. You are one of the first. We will slowly get the rest<br />- over a thousand - but they will pay much more dearly than you. Most will<br />get the death penalty.<br />Okay I am done. You have maybe 10 minutes before I give my team the go ahead.<br />3rd message<br />Also if you do pay we will expect the first payment by 5pm. A VERY large<br />payment. 35%. Then 35% tomorrow at 5pm and finally the last 30% at 8am the<br />next day.<br />Now quit stalling for time. Also we are monitoring your phone and texts.<br />Yes we know you you&#039;ve been calling! You tell a soul - even your girl -<br />and this whole deal goes out the window.<br />Decide. I&#039;m losing my Goddamn patients.<br />4th message( i told them i would pay to fuck with them)<br />Okay then. If you won&#039;t answer then you have a deadline. You have 1 hour<br />to deposit 30 bitcoins into the account shredder:<br />19zJWnYwSqNzvrsQWwNZtDo5oxVKkQowt5<br />You start from there and we&#039;ve started off on the right foot. This is your<br />one and only chance. 1 hour.<br />me: i wrote <br />&nbsp;this is after i told them to go fuck off! since THANK GOODNESS I USED A DIFFERENT STATE THAN I LIVE! AND MY FRIEND RESHIPS TO ME, HE USED HIS NEIGHBORS MAILBOX SINCE THEY WORK OUT OF TOWN FOR 3 MONTHS AT A TIME! AND I HARDLY EVER USE THIS!!!!! BUT I AM SOO GLAD I DID BUT AFTER I TOLD THEM IM NOT DUMB! ARNOLD STARTS TO&nbsp; SAY HE WILL KILL MY KIDS!!! WTF IF THIS DOESNT GET HIM BANNED! I AM DONE! IF THIS HAD BEEN A GOOD ADDRESS! I COULD HAVE SOME THUGS AT MY DOOR! OR COPS! WTF I NEED SOME MONITORS,SR ADMIN. SHIT EVEN DPR NEEDS TO KNOW THIS SHIT! AND SOMETHING NEEDS DONE READ WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO!<br /><br />ARNOLD (HE WROTE): <br />&nbsp;Also know its not who your gonna dial right now on the phone<br />that we have been tapping for weeks. He has something to say.<br />Fuck You<br />Also now we know your build, hight, weight,<br />kids names, your name, etc, etc. Well looks like you found us out.<br /><br />We ain&#039;t no fucking cops. We&#039;re what they used to call in the old days<br />hitmen. If you think we can find Arnold do you think we can&#039;t find you.<br />Now listen here you stupid fuck. We will find you. We found the farm. We<br />found your &quot;friend&quot; ;) We&#039;ll find you, your kids and your girl. You don&#039;t<br />give us $100,000 starting tonight and I&#039;ll put a bullet in each one as we<br />make you watch. Once it&#039;s done we&#039;ll leave. So you get to live knowing you<br />killed your children and girl for money.<br /><br />You have till 10pm MT to respond. But you might want to a bit earlier<br />because that&#039;s when you&#039;ll have your first payment due. Also same rules.<br />You tell a sole and the person you tell gets it in the back of their head.<br />You see you don&#039;t understand. We have wires in every room, phone, and<br />anything you could call with. Hell we even have it on some of your shirts.<br />Lol. Although you would never be able to find them because you&#039;re not<br />smart enough to know where they would be.<br />We hope to hear from you soon. It sucks to shoot children but its our jobs.<br /><br />ME: I TELL HIM TO FUCK OFF AND GET A LIFE AND SEND HIM PICS OF MY CALICO, AK AND 3 PISTOLS AND I GET<br />ARNOLD(REPLIES):<br />Jesus Christ you stupid mother fucker. One more time on the boards and I<br />shoot the first born between the eyeballs.<br /><br /><br />NOW SR ADMINS IF THIS ARN0LD GUY STILL HAS A ACCOUNT IN A DAY! YOU ARE GIVING HIM PEOPLES PERSONAL INFO! SO HE CAN BLACKMAIL THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Dang! If this is true thats really fucking messed up. That&#039;s a straight up evil person right there.<br />An Arn0ld exists here:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/dca4d95a5f<br />But he seems to have fairly good reputation. 3 months. 98+% positive feedback. over 300 transactions. I could see maybe sinces hes not a seller for long that it may be sketchy. But over 300 transactions and over 98 + feedback is pretty good.<br />Hopefully this guy really did get phished because that would suck if he&#039;s about to screw everyone over! Sounds like a scam to me though. Telling you he wants money everyday. I always think if these people got you...well then where are they?<br />Or maybe this guy sold his account?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know but hopefully it all works out well for you. Those were some messed up messages and I hope they will never be applied in real life. Keep us updated...

				Like scout said, report via the main site, all PMs are saved on the SR server for 4 months so if this is legit they will have easy access to the exchanges you claim to have occurred between you and the vendor and SR support will take the appropriate action.

				Buy a pump-action shotgun and learn how to use it safely and confidently.<br /><br />Move your family to a safe place.<br /><br />Then send him a photo/video of you with your face blacked out, holding the shotgun and a placard with your SR username on it saying &quot;Come get some&quot;<br /><br />See what the keyboard cowboy says then.

				If you don&#039;t already own a firearm go get a decent shotgun with some 00 buckshot for it too. A shotgun is one of the best firearms for home defense. I&#039;d recommend a Remington 870 for the price and reliability, but there are cheaper options out there too. If you are new to guns go get a bit of practice and get comfortable with whatever you have and drill these rules into your head:<br /><br />1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded.<br />2. Never let the muzzle cover anything you are not willing to destroy.<br />3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target.<br />4. Be sure of your target and what is beyond it.<br /><br />Honestly, to me it looks like these are empty threats to try and extort money from you. His account was probably compromised, but then again there is a possibility this is all very real. Better safe than sorry though, that&#039;s for sure. I wouldn&#039;t recommend sending a picture to this guy, as was suggested in another post above. No need to escalate the issue and possibly push someone who is a bit mentally unstable to do something they wouldn&#039;t normally do.<br /><br />Stay safe and keep your eyes peeled for strange people/cars.

				Op has a good point, what keeps vendors from blackmailing people? Probably best for buyers to open up a PO box and get some junk mail sent to it on a regular basis, who knows what sort of whackjob these dealers are and if they&#039;ll come and harass you or call the cops on you.
