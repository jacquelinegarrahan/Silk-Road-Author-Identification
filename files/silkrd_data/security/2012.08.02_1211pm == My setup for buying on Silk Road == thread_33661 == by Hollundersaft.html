				hi, <br /><br />ok, first of all im not going to buy alot of stuff, usually i dont use any drugs. so its just for a couple of orders.<br /><br />so thats how i plan to do my anonymity.<br /><br />1.) MT.gox account to buy bitcoins. ---&gt; regular bank deposit is allready running, so i expect my euros in my account soon. (i also verified the account)<br /><br />2.) as soon as i purchased bitcoins im going to transfer them to bitcoin Fog and from there to my Silk Road account.<br />is it save to use &quot;Bitcoin Fog&quot;? i mean man in the middle or whatever exploit there might be and should i always transfer smaller/splittet amounts through Fog so if something happens i dont loose all of my money?<br /><br />3.) it seems that every vendor is using PGP, i have linux so i have to set this up to communicate encrypted.<br /><br />4.) of course i use TOR for everything except for MT.GOX because they seem to block TOR-IPs and they know me well anyway because of the bank deposit and the verification.<br /><br />is this process ok, especially the Bitcoin Fog--process. because this would make my cash anonymous again as far as i understand.<br /><br />ahh, and what about escrow, someone mentioned this in a SR-Howto i should by five books or similar, because some vendors dont like me in escrow. i completely didnt understand what he meant.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks alot for any advice!<br /><br />greets.

				I too have a similar question. I&#039;m hoping someone can give a bit of input here. Right now I&#039;m only looking to make a small purchase to start, less than 10 btc.<br /><br />Is it safe to use Dwolla to buy bticoins from get-bitcoin/bitinstant/mtgox and then use Bitcoin Fog to hide the origin and make them anonymous?<br /><br />&quot;We make your bitcoins truly anonymous!&quot; is this true?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I agree with your setup except for the bank account. I would never allow money from my bank to go to buy bitcoins. It&#039;s much safer to walk into a bank and deposit money into an exchanger&#039;s accont to purchase bitcoins to be deposited into an online waller, then to bitcoin fog.<br /><br />BB

				I was going to send my bitcoins directly from Mt-gox&nbsp; to&nbsp; SR,&nbsp; i thought all Bit-coin addreses were anonymous??&nbsp;

				Bitcoin can be anonymouse if you ensure you are never tied to it.<br />But just remember that all transactions are easily traceable (they are all in the blockchain, so everyone who uses bitcoin client has a receipt of every transaction sitting on thier computer already).<br />Laundering services like fog give you different coins than the ones you give them, to break that link.<br />I dont realy bother with any of it, im just a small fish not worth anyones time and effort.<br />If i was a vendor or doing anything large then i would take more care though.<br />I&#039;d avoid connecting to btc or exhanges using my IP address for a start.<br />Spose i could make new wallets/accounts and start doing that if i wanted, not worth the hastle for me though.
