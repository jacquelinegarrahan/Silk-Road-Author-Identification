You don&#039;t really need to worry about the private key as you won&#039;t be giving it out to anyone. GPG will know about it. When you go to decrypt a message that someone has encrypted with your public key, GPG will know about the private key and use it for decryption. <br /><br />Basically, you are pretty much good to go.<br />

You will need to import their public key and then encrypt your message using their key. You should have the option of including your public key in your message but if you are responding to them, they already have it.

				Once I got the general idea, starting with downloading and using gpg4win, then saving my own public key in a handy file on my desktop so I could send it off to people, I then downloaded and read the documentation included on their site. www.gpg4win.org/documentation.html&nbsp; It only took me a little while, and it was really informative, laying all the stuff out pretty basically&nbsp; After that, I just found sombody who I could practice with..., or you can just post your public key on here, and me or somebody would send you an encrypted message, which you can decipher, since you have the private key that accompanies it...once you get the basics, it&#039;s really cool and ingenious, how it works...but we&#039;ve all been thru this, to one degree or another: I too had to kind of put a lot of study in, on pgp and btc both, but it&#039;s part of what makes this site what it is....best wishes...

				Ecstacy:<br /><br />I will help you. Why? Just because I want to. I´ve been reading a lot about GPG and I got how it work just a few days ago. It´s really (I mean REALLY) easy once you figure it out, but at the begging was kind of pain-in-the-ass without any help as I did. If you already got it, good to you but if not, post it here and I will guide you step by step.
