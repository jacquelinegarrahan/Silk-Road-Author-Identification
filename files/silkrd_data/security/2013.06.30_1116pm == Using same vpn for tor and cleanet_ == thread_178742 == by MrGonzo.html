				Is it safe to use a vpn over your regular internet connection and then use it over tor to access onion sites? I plan on getting a vpn soon but have never used one before. When you purchase one does it provide you with one connection or multiple ones? I&#039;m sorry for the silly question i&#039;m just trying to better understand vpn.

				http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/<br /><br />You should set up your own VPN in Iceland, google how to do this. Sorry can&#039;t write it all out here would take forever.<br />Also look for &quot;logwiper.sh&quot; it&#039;s the handy Debian log killer the NSA left lying around one of their Flame/Stuxnet control servers. <br /><br />Is it safe? Depends what kind of a target you are. Are you selling mass quantities of dope? Then no. Are you running this site? Then no. Otherwise it&#039;s good enough to fool your ISP into only seeing a vpn connection and not a direct Tor connection. Also look up how to control DNS leaks through your VPN (if you use windows) but Torbrowser already does this.<br /><br />Should also look at fixtracking.com the site set up by DuckDuckGo that recommends privacy addons (for regular, non critical browsing)<br /><br /><br /><br />

Either options would have been fine.
