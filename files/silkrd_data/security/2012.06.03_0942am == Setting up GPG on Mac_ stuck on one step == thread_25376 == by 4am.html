				So I&#039;ve been working on getting GPG set up to encrypt my address but when I go to <br /><br />System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts<br /><br />I get this (http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/upload/f921e1e475ef81f02b7f29a6954e5496.png) screen which shows nothing near Services -&gt; Text.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked at multiple guides and tutorials and haven&#039;t found anything over the past few hours to help me get passed this. Has anyone else had this same System Preferences difference? <br /><br />Thanks a lot for any help

				I just finished setting up my Mac for PGP as well. What version of OS are you running? I&#039;m on the latest, (Lion, I think) and that might be why you&#039;re seeing Keyboard and Mouse, when it should be just Keyboard by it&#039;s self in System Preferences. <br /><br />One problem I&#039;m still having is needing the other persons public key when decrypting. Sometimes I need it, sometimes it just decrypts after I enter the passphrase. I&#039;m curious if you have the same problem.<br /><br />After getting thru all of this and getting it working, I&#039;ve re-read thru some of the forums and now I&#039;m thinking of running parallel Windows on the Mac. Just a thought....

				I&#039;m still running Snow Leopard, so it&#039;s unlikely to be because of your OS.<br />I&#039;m not sure how to upload a picture so I can&#039;t really help much. If anyone knows how, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />sdesu

				Yeah my MBP is about 4 years old, and running OSX 10.5.8<br /><br />420blindman, I haven&#039;t really gotten anywhere yet so I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;ve gotten everything installed and created my own key, but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Ugh, I don&#039;t want to have to spend the money to upgrade or partition for Windows JUST so that I can satisfy the few vendors who require GPG encrypted addresses.

Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is irretrievable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key so that even we at Silk Road would be unable to view it, even if we wanted to.&quot;<br /><br />sdesu
