				Layers of carpet work really well once you get like more than a few. Try building a box for it with a lid on hinges and put like 5 layers of carpet on the interior and if it is still too loud you can add some to the exterior.

				You&#039;re best option is probably to sound proof the entire room it is in. You can buy acoustic wedge foam (kinda $$$$) that can be put on the walls/ceiling to help contain the noise. There is also plastic-like sheeting that comes in rolls that supposedly work in sound dampening. A cheap/free alternative to the acoustic wedge foam that would be purchased, is to get egg crates that chicken eggs in the U.S. come packaged in at the grocery store (I assume the cardboard crates are similar in the E.U. as well). But anyway, they can be lined up on the walls and ceiling to bounce sound back into your apartment, or away from prying ears. If you don&#039;t want to line the whole place up with sound proofing stuff, try a directional approach to keep the suspicious noise away from the doorway/hallway. Also try this in conjunction with loud music or TV maybe, though just don&#039;t make enough noise to get a noise complaint the police follow up on.
