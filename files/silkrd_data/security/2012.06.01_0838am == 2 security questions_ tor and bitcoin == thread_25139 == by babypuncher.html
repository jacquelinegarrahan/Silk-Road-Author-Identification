				Hey folks, <br /><br />I am very new at this and have made a few purchases on the road. <br /><br />I have 2 questions for the experienced peeps out there: <br /><br />1. Is it relatively anonymous to purchase bitcoins, and then transfer them first to instawallet and then to silkroad ? Is this a sufficient washing process ? <br /><br />2. When I start up TOR, I always use the network map and hit &quot;refresh&quot; and pick a &quot;new identity.&quot; I also go to a different web page ( eg. google) every time <br />to select the silk road wikipedia page ( to get the web address). Are these good or bad security ideas? <br /><br />Any tips would be much appreciated !!&nbsp;

But then if you send them to an online wallet and then to SR, that&#039;s is not good at all in my opinion. You&#039;d be much better off using an intermediary like bitcoin fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) which masks the transaction very well. Witrh respect to depositing cash by the way, in almost all banks they will not ask for your ID for this.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25139.msg268005#msg268005">Quote from: babypuncher on June 01, 2012, 08:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.

But for getting the SR address,&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why you do this. It&#039;s just sufficient to store SR&#039;s URL somewhere and then paste it into the web browser. If you actively search for it, you might wind up in a spoof website where you could wind up giving your password to a scammer and goodbye bitcoins if you have a balance.<br /><br />goblin

Bookmarking it won&#039;t compromise your security in any way, Tor doesn&#039;t save your browsing history so it won&#039;t look like you&#039;ve ever been here.

Any other method is potentially traceable. By all means send me a message if you need any help.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.
