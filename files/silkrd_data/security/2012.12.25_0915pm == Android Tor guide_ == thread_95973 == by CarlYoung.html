				Using Tor on an Android (or Apple) portable device is not a safe practice. Logging in to SR on a device with an IMEI number is CRAZY! If you value your anonymity, don&#039;t access SR and log into your account using an Android or Apple mobile device. Why take a risk when there are much safer ways.

				FUCK ME!<br />Alright, I have accessed both my forum and SR account on BOTH an Android and Apple device. I used Onion browser using an Apple device, and Orbot+Orweb on Android.

PGP use will cover my ass even if I start to use it now. Cease to access SR on Apple and Android devices.<br />3.

However, I did find this interview with independent security researcher, hacker, and privacy advocate Jacob Appelbaum, who among other things, talks about mobile phone security. Here is part of the interview and a link will be posted below for the full interview.<br /><br />Resnick: What should we know about cell phones? It’s hard to imagine going to a protest without one. But like all networked technologies, surely they are double-edged?<br /><br />Appelbaum: Cell phones are tracking devices that make phone calls. It’s sad, but it’s true. Which means software solutions don’t always matter. You can have a secure set of tools on your phone, but it doesn’t change the fact that your phone tracks everywhere you go. And the police can potentially push updates onto your phone that backdoor it and allow it to be turned into a microphone remotely, and do other stuff like that. The police can identify everybody at a protest by bringing in a device called an IMSI catcher. It’s a fake cell phone tower that can be built for 1500 bucks. And once nearby, everybody’s cell phones will automatically jump onto the tower, and if the phone’s unique identifier is exposed, all the police have to do is go to the phone company and ask for their information.<br /><br />Resnick: So phones are tracking devices. They can also be used for surreptitious recording. Would taking the battery out disable this capability?<br /><br />Appelbaum: Maybe. But iPhones, for instance, don’t have a removable battery; they power off via the power button. So if I wrote a backdoor for the iPhone, it would play an animation that looked just like a black screen. And then when you pressed the button to turn it back on it would pretend to boot. Just play two videos.<br /><br />Resnick: And how easy is it to create something like to that?<br /><br />Appelbaum: There are weaponized toolkits sold by companies like FinFisher that enable breaking into BlackBerries, Android phones, iPhones, Symbian devices and other platforms. And with a single click, say, the police can own a person, and take over her phone.<br /><br />http://www.infiniteunknown.net/2012/09/09/leave-your-cellphone-at-home-interview-with-jacob-appelbaum/<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Guru first raised these issues and it&#039;s a shame he is no longer here to chime in. I won&#039;t be accessing SR from my mobile phone but if others want to, that&#039;s their choice to make.

				I am somewhat worried about the connection because just two days ago I was on this forum, i posted that I had used mobile platforms. Last night, I tried to use my new pin which i wrote down, and was told it is wrong. I tried until it became reset. I am now waiting to hear from SR support about what is happenin. I changed my password and any malicious activity would be halted by the pin reset. I am thankful for this system and hope to see my issue resolved. I will update if I hear that my account had been compromised through Android or Iphone use.

				I recieved a message from SR Support last night, Here are the words...<br /><br />&quot;Usually if your account gets phished, they change the password, not just the pin. Plus they always empty out your account, so if that hasn&#039;t happened then I think your okay so far.

Tor is not meant to work with these and there is NO guarantee for ANY anonymity on those devices.&quot;<br /><br />I will surely be heeding their device, because I see how easily those devices could be used to get users info.

A dongle will face similar problems to a mobile phone. Don&#039;t panic about it but I would start looking at alternative ways of connecting to the net. That is dependent on where you live and what services are available at your current address (ADSL 2+, Cable, etc). A call to your ISP will let you know what&#039;s available.

				I don&#039;t think that using your phone net connection is inherently more risky than using your home internet connection.<br /><br />First, make sure that your phone is rooted, and is running a custom ROM that has Over The Air (OTA) updates from the carrier disabled. That will prevent the hijacking of your phone through carrier-pushed malware.<br /><br />Second, get a VPN anonymously at https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/ It costs $40 dollars worth of bitcoins.<br /><br />Third, download Open VPN for Android from the playstore. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&amp;hl=en<br /><br />Fourth, follow the instructions for configuration of Open VPN for Android here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/108/openvpn-configuration-on-android-instead-of-pptp-ipsec<br /><br />Fifth, download Orbot: Tor on Android from the playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwib3JnLnRvcnByb2plY3QuYW5kcm9pZCJd<br /><br />You can run all your apps through Tor if you want to.<br /><br />Finally, run your VPN, and then Orbot (Tor) and you have Tor over VPN. That is 2 steps of protection. I don&#039;t see why that should be any more risky than using your home computer.<br /><br />

				My iPhone s jailbroke and has OTA updates disabled. The default password is changed so it cant be SSH&#039;d into. I understand all the stuff about how, if I became a person the police wanted to track, they could use my phone to do so, (especially with GPS) and remotely activate microphone (really? Can they also activate the video camera too? I&#039;m gonna start putting a bit of tape over the fucker!) Leaving aside for now the question of whether they will wish to use their resources do this to put an end to my small SR purchases rather than monitoring subversives and terrorists; I am still not clear on how using Tor from my phone could attract the attention of the police in the first place? I mean They could be intercepting my traffic between me and the nearest cell tower but to do that they&#039;d have to be watching me already? I understand the need for caution, but nothing I have read seems to suggest that using Tor from mobile is &#039;leaking&#039; my location or identity? I suppose my mobile ISP could identify the Tor packets and report to the police that I&#039;m using Tor, suggesting that I&#039;m either using SR or a peado? The police could then initiate these orwellian techniques on me and assign a umit to monitor me? I remain fairly complacent.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I&#039;m just a reckless risk taker. I did used to inject myself with heroin fairly regularly, which I guess suggests a certain carelessness about my personal wellbeing! ;)

				Cells do not have to be inherently less secure than any other internet connected device. Lock them down just the same.<br /><br />The IMEI is completely irrelevant. IMEI can be used to track your physical location across the cell network (which is why they&#039;re mentioned in that interview -- he&#039;s talking about police tracking protesters at OWS type scenarios). It&#039;s not IP-layer and it has absolutely nothing to do with onion routing. It&#039;s not sent out in packets across tor, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen far more malware on poorly patched windows boxes than phones.
