				Sellers that are also buyers, have wisely used different usernames on these forums.&nbsp; And sometimes I&#039;ve seen buyers post both names, in an effort to help know &#039;who is who...&#039;&nbsp; It&#039;s ok for the seller himself to do that, if he wishes, but totally *wrong* in my opinion for us buyers to do that.&nbsp; Many sellers wish to protect themselves, so if they haven&#039;t done it themselves, please don&#039;t post both names for the seller, when you start threads on them.&nbsp; We buyers welcome the threads, but we want to protect them any way we can, and some of them try to use a different name when buying, and selling, and even when posting.&nbsp; Sometimes it can be confusing, but I try to just use the username they have posted when selling, if I am starting a &#039;feedback&#039; thread on them.<br /><br />Often, of course, it&#039;s the same, but some of them use one name for forums and buying, and another different name just for selling, and I try, when referring to their sales, to just use the seller name, even if I am reasonably certain I know who is who...

				I don&#039;t see what the big deal is to post under my sellers account here. I do have a buyers account with a totally different name, etc. So, when I want to post regarding my products or have to do some mod stuff, I obviously use my vendors name. but when Im reviewing&nbsp; products that I have purchased I use my buyers name. I also wait a few days after the transaction is complete to avoid the chance of someone putting 2 and 2 together Also, when I post using my buyers account, the buyers account username here is totally different than my buyers account on the market, one more layer of security. That way, it&#039;s nearly impossible to put the 2 together.<br /><br />So, it depends on what im posting and the subject.

				I&#039;d probably use same name myself.&nbsp; But since it was pointed out that sellers buying under same name, might inadvertently be giving out their actual &#039;seller&#039;s&#039; address, I got to thinking about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that big a deal, really...just I know more and more, I tend to reveal more about myself, and I was wondering if sellers had that worry too.&nbsp; In actuality, this one is not that big a deal.&nbsp; As long as we all show at least a minimum of caution, about where we live, especially sellers, it should be o.k.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect to high-powered geniuses working this one, anyway...
