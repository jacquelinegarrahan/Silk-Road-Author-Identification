				I&#039;ve been reading all of the posts on here and I understand that it is added security. But for those of us who have a bit of basic computer knowledge (and common sense) is it mandatory? <br /><br />I am using my &quot;work only&quot; PC, and running an offshore VPN and then accessing TOR through the VPN in an encryped TC volume. Would you guys not consider that adequate? <br /><br />Is there really much to worry about in regards to information leaking from my PC? This isn&#039;t a loaded question I&#039;m legitimately curious if I should honestly worry about going the extra mile and transferring data back and fourth between my &quot;work&quot; PC and the Live CD. And if using the Live CD at a home connection, wouldn&#039;t the constant TOR connections and changing info be a flag for your ISP?<br /><br />Thanks boys

				I may be wrong, however I believe the reasoning behind the live CD or USB or whatever is so your computer doesn&#039;t have any traces of tor..<br /><br />the reasoning behind this, I *think* is if you are ever raided, and your computer is taken away, as long as the law don&#039;t get your USB drive with linux + tor on it, they have no proof that you even used tor.<br /><br />Even if they know you used tor they still have to prove you ordered, but its just another bit of circumstantial evidence against you.<br /><br />so if your really ultra careful, you could set it up pretty easily.

				Are you a seller or just a buyer?<br /><br />If your just a standard buyer and never acquire more than a few grams of weed you are fine with the tor browser + pgp.<br /><br />However if you do anything that involves &quot;large&quot; amounts of drugs, especially if you are a seller and you have to handle sensitive customer information a much higher level of security is necessary.

				I am an IT professional and I strongly recommend a Live CD or USB (I use the latter, Liberte&#039; styles)<br /><br />Your main concern, on top of those already mentioned, is a keylogger trojan/virus.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want ANY capture system of any kind.&nbsp; Believe me, I know how to install &#039;undetectable&#039; types of monitoring and keylogging at the local level of computing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Network security is only part of the equasion.&nbsp; You want your hardware and software secure as well.<br /><br />I recommend a laptop for portability and justification for running a &#039;secondary&#039; system next to your desktop.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t need to be fancy, live CDs/USB distros are light and nimble.&nbsp; Everything you do is encrypted, even emails to trusted partners if you have any.&nbsp; My portable system NEVER logs into my real life public systems and has never seen my real name or email.&nbsp; My home/work systems may have TOR installed, but they&#039;ve never been used for my &#039;private&#039; logins for tormail or SR/SR Forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last part:&nbsp; NEVER give consent to search your system or property.&nbsp; In the US, you lose your fifth amendment rights if you give consent.&nbsp; They can compel you to give your encryption key, as it was part of the agreement when you gave consent.&nbsp; If you&#039;re served a warrant, they can&#039;t compel shit, 5th amendment applies.<br /><br />It may be over kill, but is there such thing when it comes to your freedom.
