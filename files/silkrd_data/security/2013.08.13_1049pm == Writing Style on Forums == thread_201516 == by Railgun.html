				I heard a lot about stylometry, yet, luckily, it seems like most SR users here type pretty similarly.&nbsp; Quite contrary to the &quot;druggie&quot; persona, people here seem pretty adept at syntax.<br /><br />How much do you alter your writing style? Do you think it&#039;s important?

				Many people here write similarly, but a lot of people have unique quirks in their writing style which make it easy for non-experts (like us) to link them to other pseudonymous identities, like other forum accounts they&#039;ve used. I&#039;ve seen it happen on a few occasions, like with mtljohn and chaosforpeace. Experts using statistical analyses should fair much better than us. The only thing is, in order to learn your real identity, they would have to link your writing to things you wrote under your real identity. I hope no high profile members of this community ever kept a blog on a server that still has their IP address. Don&#039;t write long-winded posts on reddit over clearnet, either.<br />

				The way i see it is, why not change up your writing style?<br />It could only add a layer of security to you and i see no obvious cons to changing the way you write.<br /><br />and as for the &#039;druggies&#039; on here, i am willing to bet that because most people here were smart enough to teach themselves about TOR, BTC, SR, PGP etc they are educated enough to the point where they wont come off as obvious druggies. <br /><br />tl;dr most users here are smarter than the average druggie IMO

				^^I&#039;d say that&#039;s a good place to start. Change up the style without trying too hard.<br /><br />If they&#039;re using statistical analysis software to tie your SR writing style to your clearnet accounts like astor suggested, it should be quite easy to mess with your &#039;writing profile&#039; if you know the parameters it measures. <br /><br />The more writing samples they load into their database, the harder it will be to throw the program off. Anyone moving serious weight on SR should be brief and to the point while trying to blend in with the writing styles of other vendors.

				It&#039;s really easy to detect aliases if you actually put some time into analyzing the suspect writing styles. There are now tools out that can help tie writing styles to a user. Check these out:<br /><br />CLEARNET:<br />https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />Here are some tips on how to prevent your style from becoming recognizable or unique in any way:<br /><br />Switching up capitalization.

That&#039;s a huge giveaway, just stick to words in the dictionary, and it will make it that much harder for law enforcement.

You can naturally do it in a way as to fool many people, but experts it is much more difficult. Sadly the way you write and express yourself, no matter what, is sort of &quot;encoded&quot;. Even if you change your grammatical style you cannot change your propensities to express yourself in a determined way. The topic of writing is a very subtle one.<br /><br />Still it can naturally depend if something like that is enough to obtain a warrant and I don&#039;t know it. Even more it will cost a lot of money to have a group of experts to do it, so I highly doubt that as a buyer you have something to worry about on this point.

				I&#039;m skeptical. Unless someone here is John Grisham or Tom Clancy, I can&#039;t see the feds figuring out who we are based on sentence structure and grammar. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible with a large enough sample, but it just seems unlikely. I can&#039;t picture myself cooperating with LE based on their suggestion that they wanted to talk to me about my internet habits.
