				Hey, how the fuck do I know what the real .onion is for Silk Road when the Hidden Wiki and every other god-damned place lists something different?<br /><br />And, once I do know, how do I know I know?<br /><br />I&#039;ve now lost three Silk Road accounts to what I believe is phishing tactics, but.. in the end, how do I know what&#039;s the authoritative source of the TOR? There&#039;s an address on Wikipedia: is that really the authoritative address? And how do I know?<br />

				http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion is the real site. it can be found in a bunch of different forum posts, or the gawker article about Silk road. you know the gawker article has the right link, because those articles cant be edited by phishers 24 hours a day like the wiki can. I suggested that they put the correct link at teh top of the forum and the top of the wiki, but it is not there yet. My advice is to save the link somewhere like on a flash drive so you don&#039;t ever have to trust a link you find on the hidden wiki. <br /><br />--edit-- I wonder if a user id/password combo like fuckoff phisher would be safe from them even trying it on the real site

				TORDIR has the good link as well. If it&#039;s a phishing scam, it&#039;s labelled as that.<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/<br />Just memorize the first few letters, that way you&#039;ll be able to identify it permanently in the future.

				Memorize it man... I used to just keep it encrypted in PGP on my computer and decrypted it each time I wanted to use it, but that got tiring.<br /><br />Memorizing it is easier than it seems<br /><br />break up the phrase<br /><br />ianxz&nbsp; &nbsp;6zefk&nbsp; &nbsp;72ulzz&nbsp; &nbsp;.onion<br /><br />Very easy, 3 parts, each rather basic. <br /><br />First part is like a name, with xz. IANxz.<br /><br />the next part can be pronounced six-zefk. Fairly straight forward.<br /><br />Last part is just... 72ulzz. Just remember the sounds of each part. <br /><br />After about recalling this from memory with this method I had it memorized in about 2-4 tries. Same concept can be applied to any TOR address, just break it up.<br /><br />This way, it&#039;s from your memory, you&#039;ll never be phised.
