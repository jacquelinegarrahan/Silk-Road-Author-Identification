				From what I understand, there is a good reason that MPGD is not a very commonly accepted form of payment. Only seen it for people wanting very small amounts (&lt;50$). Sorry I don&#039;t have a more detailed explanation, I hope someone can help!

				LTTM, yes a buyer will get a MoneyPak card, load it with cash and get a code.&nbsp; This code can be given to you and you can send the money associated with the code to a PayPal account.<br /><br />But if you start accepting MoneyPak and end up with a lot of money in a PayPal account, it might eventually draw some attention -- where did you get all of this money?, etc....

				I&#039;ve been using GD for a few years now. It&#039;s a very simple process. Personally, I would bypass paypal and just get a GD re loadable debit card . This way you can go right to the ATM and withdraw cash. <br /><br /><br />1. The buyer would go to any local drug store or wherever the &quot;Reload Packs**&quot; are sold, and give the cashier whatever amount of money they want to put on the reload pack along with the $4.99 USD for the reload pack itself. <br />2. This reload pack contains a number. The buyer would give this number code to the seller. The seller needs to have a GD card already (you can purchase these at your local drugstore ) <br />4. Now the seller will need to reload his/her card with the number from the reload pack. This is done by telephone talking to a computer, or on the GD website. <br />This debit card also has the visa or MasterCard logo on it allowing any money you have on your card to be easily withdrawn from an ATM or you can use the card as a standard debit card and shop since it has the visa/MasterCard logo on it. <br /><br />**I believe they now sell just plain old prepaid cards as well. Be sure to tell the buyer they need to put money on the reload moneypak. Ppl will get confused and buy themselves a whole new prepaid debit card. <br /><br /><br />personally Ive been using GD for years when I used to sell &quot;goods&quot; and loaded and withdrawn prob upwards of over $15,000 in one year. no problems at all. <br /><br />I have one card with my name on it and another without. You can view all your transactions on the website, on an app on your smart phone, or just dial the number on the pack or card. <br /><br /><br />-Vices856<br /><br /><br />

				If you use PayPal, it can easily be traced to you. You have to get a prepaid debit card under a fake name and use the moneypak to reload it and then you can withdraw cash from an ATM.

				www.bitcoinexchange.cc&nbsp; will exchange moneypaks for BTC or many other forms of currency.<br /><br />I have used them and can say they are legit. However, the debit card option in someone else&#039;s name is a much better option. No waiting / No Fees<br /><br />I wont say which one i use now. hahah

				Why not just hit a few ATMs? Cash is original form of untraceable currency after all. I believe some ATM&#039;s have security cams so it might be a good idea to have someone else make the withdrawal. Would also say do it in another city. You could always grab a homeless person to do it. They are usually not well fed so beating the money out of them wouldn&#039;t be hard if they stiff ya. If your talking large amounts, you will need to clean the cash. I recommend you do two passes just because to be on the safe side. Just my thoughts, please feel free to poke holes in this idea. I&#039;m not some money laundering mastermind afterall. or am I.... :P
