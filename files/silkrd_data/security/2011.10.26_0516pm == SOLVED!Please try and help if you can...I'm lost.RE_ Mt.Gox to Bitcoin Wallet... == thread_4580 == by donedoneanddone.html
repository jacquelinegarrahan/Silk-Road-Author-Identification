				Thank you to everyone. It may not have looked liked it but I was a searching fool before I came here crying for help. I am sure I&#039;m not the only one who can&#039;t find the answer to everything, but I am very grateful for everyone on this board for the sincere help. I truly, as you can tell, would have been lost.<br /><br />mseller especially...ABOVE and beyond any expectation. Thank you again and again.<br /><br /><br />Here is my original thread. Someone messaged and told me I might get better help from this board.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4225.0<br /><br />FYI: Please talk to me like I am an idiot because when it comes to this, I am...lol. <br /><br />As you can see, this has been going for days now. I just today, like an idiot, discovered I could transfer directly from Mt.Gox to Silk Road so I did so with my remaining measly coins and it worked beautifully. My original method of going through the Bitcoin Wallet was today found to be useless.<br /><br />Now I have coins, that were every dime I had. I fear they are lost. I&#039;ve had an open ticket for days with Mt.Gox and they&#039;ve been responsive, but so far I&#039;m only being told to add Port 8333 and add Bitcoin.exe to my list of exceptions. I&#039;ve done that with no change. I even went as far as to turn off completely at one point all protection and firewalls and the result didn&#039;t change.<br /><br />I&#039;m still stuck at 132,912 blocks and have been for days...<br /><br />Is there a way to just cancel this transfer on the end of Mt.Gox and then go directly to Silk Road? I&#039;ve asked them the same question, but it&#039;s been hours and hours now with no response. <br /><br />I won&#039;t explain my entire situation, but let&#039;s just say it&#039;s dire. I have 2 days max to find these coins and get them to Silk Road and don&#039;t know what else to do.<br /><br />Thank you all sincerely, from the bottom of my heart for any and all ideas.<br />

				I month ago I had similar problem, my ewallet stoped to download all blocks. There is solution,<br />there are donwloads where you can download entire blockchain yourself and update those files, but I am not sure would you want to do that.<br />I have solved problem that way, you can go on bitcoin forum and try with search option find different solution.<br />Before doing anything make a backup of your bitcoin files located in the <br />C:\Documents and Settings\USER***\Application Data\Bitcoin<br /><br />Stop your bitcoin client.<br />Try downloading the blockchain manually from here http://81.169.129.25/blockchain/ <br />Extract it and overwrite the blkindex.dat and blk0001.dat in your ~/.bitcoin/ directory.<br />Restart your client with the -rescan option.<br /><br />I have 3 withdraw pending 10 days old (2k) from MtGox, thier support do not give me any response and I am stucked, no cash flow.<br />I can only wait and hope to the best.

				Thanks for replying. Sorry to see you have problems on your end as well.<br /><br />I do see what you&#039;re saying about downloading the block chains myself, but I am not that computer savvy and would be terrified of losing every last dime I have. In my case it&#039;s &quot;only 100 coins&quot;...but it&#039;s all I&#039;ve got...<br /><br />Thanks again and the best of luck to you. <br /><br />I should also add that I am not against a &quot;donation&quot; for some trusted help. It&#039;s money I don&#039;t have but would be most willing to give.

				You can not lose money if your ewallet client is showing 0.<br />Your funds are stored in that big blockchain file but your blockchain file on your computer are not completed and it can not show that funds because its incomlete.<br /><br />You can try this,<br />settings&gt;check through socks4 proxy<br />then wait and see what happens<br />then uncheck it.<br />restart bitcoin.<br /><br />Play with those, it will download but very slow.<br />

				So if I were to find instructions on downloading the block chains myself onto bitcoin wallet then it is something that I (a complete newbie) could do easily? My fear of course, is losing the money, but if there is no chance of me messing something up, then I guess it&#039;s no harm done, right?<br />

				Thank you for reassuring me you are here with me, you have no idea how comforting that is to know.<br /><br />I found a site that states:<br /><br />&quot;You can download block chain database offline &amp; then copy it to the folder where wallet.dat is stored.<br />Usually C:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin<br /><br />http://eu1.bitcoincharts.com/blockchain/<br /><br />Extract the file blk0001.dat &amp; blkindex.dat to the above folder replacing old ones.<br /><br />You can run bitcoin.exe -rescan, so that it rescan everything instead of downloading.<br />you have your block chain saved.&quot;<br /><br />I go to the site and I see all of the updated blocks and then I get scared, lol. I understand the part of where the wallet is located. In my case it&#039;s C:\Program Files\Bitcoin . But then I&#039;m lost as to where to download these files. <br /><br />Would I download the latest October 26th and simply save them into that folder on my hard drive? If so, that sounds simple enough, but would I have bitcoin closed first, then download, then restart? Or do I do it while it is running? Or does it not matter? <br /><br />Then I am also unclear on the rescan part. I don&#039;t see anything in my folder saying &quot;rescan&quot; but have seen several sites that mention it...<br /><br />Thanks again. I&#039;d hug you right now if I could!

				It&#039;s taken hours but thanks 100% to you, I can finally say I&#039;ve made progress. I made it all the way to before the last step (the rescan). I know this sounds stupid, because at the start of computers all that existed was DOS, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get a DOS prompt anymore and even if I did, for some reason my brain is not processing what you are telling me I need to type if I can get there. <br /><br />The process I have made was downloading and rewriting the files for the block chains. It&#039;s only been running a few minutes and I am at 8 connections and 150,744 blocks, but no transactions. I don&#039;t know if at this point, I should still try and figure out the rescan or see what happens?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />On ANOTHER note. I logged into my Silk Road account to get here and the 37 bitcoins I was able to transfer directly to them today...GONE. I&#039;ve written and don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll get a response, but following this is what it says on my account page and the message I wrote them. Please help me not have a heart attack over here.<br /><br />I finally, being a new bitcoin client, got some of my coins transferred here today. I log in now and they are gone. Transaction here:<br /><br />admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿-74.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿0.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 26, 2011, 9:39 pm UTC<br />admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿37.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿74.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 26, 2011, 8:21 pm UTC<br />deposit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(MY DEPOSIT # WAS HERE)฿37.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;฿37.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 26, 2011, 3:20 pm UTC<br /><br />Please explain? I am more confused than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				You do not see transaction because you did not made a rescan.<br />Ok, do rescan this way;<br />Close bitcoin client.<br />go to bitcoin client shortcut on your desktop.

				Well done mseller: it&#039;s easier to do than to explain, I know that.&nbsp; But as stated, you can&#039;t &#039;loose&#039; those bitcoins.&nbsp; If you have your wallet.dat, and they were sent there, you&#039;ll get them.&nbsp; But for one thing, don&#039;t send directly to SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found that one computer I have, a netbook, for some reason, never finishes getting all the blocks...takes way too long, and then stalls about 10,000 blocks beneath where it needs to be.<br /><br />But I realized I can&#039;t--nor can anybody--expect people on SR to go into the extensive details it takes to do this, so I learned on my own, same way I learned how to use pgp...SR is definitely *not* for people not willing to do some serious research about &#039;how things work&#039;.<br /><br />For btc, I got all the info I needed on bitcointalk.org.&nbsp; They have people having this exact same problem.&nbsp; I suggest signing up there--as I did--and posting that you can&#039;t get these blocks, and then they will direct you to the threads where people have the exact same problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, any newbie having troubles downloading btc should go to bitcointalk.org, and you&#039;ll find your problem answered there.&nbsp; This happens daily.&nbsp; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47788.0

				be sure to check out instawallet.org, as an intermediary, when you are sending btc around, so that these is less of a link between your own wallet.dat, and SR.&nbsp; They don&#039;t take all that long,&nbsp; and are handy.&nbsp; Be sure to bookmark the page that opens up for you: that is your address.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can always do what I do too, and practice with really small amounts, just to see how it works, but it&#039;s pretty basic.
