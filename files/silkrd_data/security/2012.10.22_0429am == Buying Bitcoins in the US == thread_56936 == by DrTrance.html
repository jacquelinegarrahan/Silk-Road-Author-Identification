				I use bitinstant. I got carded at CVS today, luckily I gave moneygram the info on my fake ID so it matched up but they put my fake through all the tests (hologram, blacklight) it would have failed if it was not an out of state ID because it had no UV marks.<br /><br />I heard its better to use a bank branch to pay, they apparently don&#039;t card.<br /><br />You can also try saying you left your ID at home and you have never needed it before to pay a bill, since you are sending money and not receiving they probably wont give you a problem.

				Bank deposits are infinitely easier. Just fill out the deposit slip with the account number and amount then you&#039;re good to go. No ID, no questions (really), no fake information to give... Just go with bank deposits. They&#039;re just better (though, not open 24/7 like many moneygram locations :P<br />.Hades.

				You could buy it from me through paypal if the fees arent too high. Then again, people ruined that completely for me and new users:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=57716.0<br /><br />Good luck to you mate!

				i seen no problem with using my information.... i buy and sell bitcoins for profit ;)... i will avoid it but i believe you have to have an account with Walmart to use the money gram service... so showing ID sounds unavoidable but 99% of the people working at Walmart don&#039;t even know what a Bitcoin&nbsp; nor who i am sending the money too... that is my business... i hate banks and avoid going to them so scratch that... can i randomize where i am sending the BTC after i send them to my account? this would prove useful i believe though vendors prob do something like this, yes? can anyone explain is and how BTC can be tracked?

				Unnoticed?<br />Now that is just a silly assumption but I don&#039;t care.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to do it vendor style but since there is no Walmart here I can&#039;t seem to find out how.<br />Already doing it for IRL friends, but they trust me ofcourse since they know me :)
