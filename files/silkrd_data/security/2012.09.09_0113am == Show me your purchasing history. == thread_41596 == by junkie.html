				Before he had any stats at all he was demanding potential buyers send in their info so he could make sure they were &quot;serious&quot;. If you search the forums you&#039;ll find other issues.

				Partially agree. <br /><br />While the vendor in particular may be a bit strange and untrust worthy I can attempt to explain what practice he is going for here. Although his method is not needed and may only add to above said suspicion.<br /><br />As a vendor more times then not a buyer thinks they are &quot;baiting&quot; you by saying that their transaction stats are better then they are. So in this vendors mind, he created that listing to point them to. Have them &quot;buy&quot; it so he can see their stats.<br /><br />He probably ALSO thinks that he will earn and maintain a good vendor ranking score (100) by doing this.<br /><br />What he probably doesn&#039;t not realize is this:<br /><br />1) While this will add to his &quot;transaction number&quot; as a vendor it will not help his (100) as that number is weighted based on price. So free listing = no points. Looks at the reputable BTC/MP vendors. Over 300 transactions, but still not ranked (100)<br /><br />2)You do not need to do this to see a buyers transaction stats. Personally if I ever need to ask them, I ask them. If we agree, they buy. Once they take the first step to purchase you (on the vendor side) can see their stats. If they lied to me I cancel the order. This does not effect anyone anymore then that.<br /><br />so WHO KNOWS what that vendor thinks, but that is the low down otherwise.<br />
