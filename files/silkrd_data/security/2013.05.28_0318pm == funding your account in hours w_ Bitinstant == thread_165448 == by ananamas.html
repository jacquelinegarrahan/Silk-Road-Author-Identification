				I fumbled around with Bitinstant and sent money to the wrong address ($30) the first time I tried to purchase coins about 1.5 years ago. My own mistake kept me from trying this site until I couldn&#039;t ignore everyone else using it so easily any longer. <br /><br />The last piece of advice on the forum I read gave me 100% of the knowledge I needed to use Bitinstant again. It&#039;s this Youtube video tutorial. Here&#039;s for good karma.<br /><br />&nbsp;Their fees are 3.99% + small &quot;zipzap&quot; fees around $4 (when I spent $300). Maybe I&#039;ll save someone money since coins on SR cost 10-30% which is outrageous. <br /><br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGPSfJ4tCSA<br /><br />^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

				I plan on using Bitinstant, I&#039;ve read people stating to use a fake name, etc. But I don&#039;t want to have any problems, then try to solve them through some fake information I put down. I know buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, but it does seem like there is a fair amount of &quot;investigation&quot; going into them lately with the whole Mt. Gox thing.

I have used BI through a CVS multiple times without being asked for ID, but recently they said they required one to let me make the payment.<br /><br />Even though I said I was there as a favor to my friend and my ID would not match the one on the payment, they would not let me pay it. So I walked away. <br /><br />I would recommend using Blue Sky Traders. With them, you can just deposit cash at a BofA. They won&#039;t ask to ID you or anything.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m not saying that BI isn&#039;t a good source. Or isn&#039;t reliable. But their option through CVS is sometimes sketchy. Maybe try a local WalMart. People seem to have good experiences there.

Buying bitcoin isn&#039;t illegal unless you&#039;re doing it in a way to avoid things like the IRS or launder money, and those only raise red flags if the amounts are large. If you&#039;re just a small time buyer, you have NOTHING to worry about with BTC privacy. What you need to worry about is being greedy and buying too much shit, then getting busted on a CD. That&#039;s how they get you, not through BTC. They get the BIG time guys through BTC.

				BofA deposits have always scared the living hell out of me. I don&#039;t care if they don&#039;t read my ID, it&#039;s a bank. I&#039;d trust CVS more than I&#039;d trust a multi-national bank. I&#039;m fully aware of BST&#039;s reputation... but for every 1 camera I find in a walmart, there is 5 in a BofA. The space is smaller, and it is a lot harder to avoid things. That, and I don&#039;t see any difference in trust between depositing money in someone&#039;s account versus sending money via moneygram.<br /><br />I use bitinstant with moneygram. Shortest has been 30min. Longest was a day, but it was later at night. While it is perfectly possible for someone to ask for an ID whether they need to or not, read the policies and the form clearly before you fill it out at moneygram (or any other, like westernunion). All of them, have very visible values for what would constitute a request for an ID. I seem to remember moneygram being like $900 or $1000. If you don&#039;t do that high of an amount and they ask for ID, just say you don&#039;t have it with you. What is the worst they can do? Say no? If you go to a walmart, trust me, they aint gonna care, and if they do the next shift wont. Moneygram isn&#039;t used by morgan stanley for million dollar trades, and you won&#039;t find someone in walmart tryin to transfer $100,000. They aren&#039;t going to draw attention if YOU don&#039;t draw attention.<br /><br />Honestly, I have never seen the appeal to using easywallet. It isn&#039;t hard to generate and burn a wallet, at least when I do it myself I know I get my money. At least, to me, the result is the same. It&#039;s not a tumbler.

				That should be the amount you receive. You will have to pay an extra 3.99 at the cvs teller for your transaction though. Whenever I find a listing I want on SR, I calculate the price of the bitcoin amount the listing is worth. Then, I add either 10-15% on top of that. I never went under using that method. And always had en extra couple dollars in coins in my wallets after the fact. Like 3-5$ extra.

Since if you use a service like this, there is a fee at the place (ie, moneygram fees), you pay those fees up front. So, the only &quot;fee&quot; that is truly gone, is the 3.99%. This is actually relatively standard across the board - its no different than a credit card transaction fee that companies have when they charge cards (assessed by the merchant, to the charging company, not the individual). The fee is actually assessed by the company that handles the transaction, not bitinstant, however bitinstant does get a small amount of that 3.99%. This is how they are able to stay open. You would get $384 worth of bitcoins in your SR wallet - no more no less.

They use the monegram expresspay bill service. I&#039;ve paid other bills over it for the same amount (not zip zap, the moneygram service).
