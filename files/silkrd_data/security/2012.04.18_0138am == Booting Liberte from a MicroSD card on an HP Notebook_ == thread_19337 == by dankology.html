				I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to boot liberte, I&#039;ve followed the website&#039;s instructions to a T, my only problem is when I turn my computer on to boot it up I can&#039;t figure out what its on.&nbsp; I&#039;ve set my boot order usb hard drive first, and the other usb option 2nd but still nothing.&nbsp; My boot list only contains like floppy drive, cd rom drive, and hard drive (Im going to restart soon and write everything down)<br /><br />Anyone have a clue how to get me into liberte?&nbsp; Im using an hp pavillion g6-1c58dx notebook right now but I have access to a toshiba and another HP along with a couple PCs, all running windows vista/windows 7 (this one is windows 7)

				You could &#039;chain load&#039; boot, meaning your USB drive has instructions to boot the MicroSD card. Just needs a copy of grub with instructions where to boot the SD card.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming you have card readers that can&#039;t be booted in the BIOS. As microsd is different from usb<br />I just burn Liberte to disk, boot that and then use USB and MicroSD cards for the persistent drive encrypted.<br /><br />I&#039;ll look around for yous. Can also download Virtualbox and select your MicroSD card as holding the operating system <br />

				It should work on an SD card though, with your ~/persist encrypted drive ready to go. Try another laptop with the BIOS updated to latest version.<br /><br />When I used Liberte I just burned it to disk, and plugged in a USB drive once it booted to desktop which automounted with my encrypted files on it. I used Applications-&gt;System Tools-&gt;Disk Utility to unencrypt and encrypt the drive which held GPG keys and other things. I stopped using Liberte because of it&#039;s bullshit root lockout. <br /><br />Tails works really well with this:<br />https://store.ironkey.com/<br /><br />Boot Tails/Amnesic in bridge mode (you get bridge IPs from Tor by emailing them, it autoresponds) then plug in the Ironkey and double click it&#039;s linux.sh file. Enter password, your hardware encrypted USB drive is now ready with all your Truecrypt hidden containers on it.<br /><br />

				I seem to recall that some laptops treat their internal card readers as floppy drives for booting purposes, so you could try that option.&nbsp; Another approach is to boot from a USB card reader, rather than the inbuilt one.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only used tails myself, so I can&#039;t offer much more input than that.

				Tried that, nothing seemed to work still.&nbsp; Im about to test a couple other computers and see if i can get it to work, is there some reason I can&#039;t connect to the internet on liberte on the VM?&nbsp; I can add my wireless connection but it won&#039;t connect to it at all.
