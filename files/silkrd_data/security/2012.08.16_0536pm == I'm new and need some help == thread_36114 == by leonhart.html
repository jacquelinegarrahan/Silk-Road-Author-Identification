				Hello! <br /><br />Well, to get right into it, I want to buy from SR. The problem being that all the methods of anonymously getting bitcoins don&#039;t work for me. (I heard about a monkeypak exchange thing, but that seems like it would have a high scam rate) I&#039;m not going to into details about why they won&#039;t work.<br /><br />The question I want to ask is this: <br />Is there really any risk if I&#039;m just buying a gram of weed?<br /><br />I just want to buy bitcoins with my debit card and go from there. I honestly don&#039;t care if it&#039;s not very anonymous, but I want to know if there&#039;s a risk involved if it&#039;s just 1g.<br /><br />

Some are more convenient than others. It&#039;s foolish assume that just because, &quot;I&#039;m only ordering a little bit&quot; that the authorities would not attempt to prosecute you given the chance. In many jurisdictions there are mandatory sentences for possession of even small amounts of Schedule 1 (or your local equivalent) substances. Don&#039;t assume that because you&#039;re not one of the bigger fish here that you&#039;re immune from danger.

				If you google, &quot;arrested for a gram of weed&quot; you&#039;ll find a lot of results that disagree with you. Aside from that, it&#039;s more or less up to the LEA/LEO if they want to bother prosecuting/arresting/harassing you or not. Just because &quot;no one cares&quot; doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t have the legal authority to press charges if they felt so inclined.
