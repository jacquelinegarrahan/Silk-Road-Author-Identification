				So I know my mailman, I know the exact path he always walks, I know the exact times he comes and I live at the end of a dead end so if any one was watching my house I would know instantly. If it is a controlled dropped should I answer the door with marker in hand write return to sender on the package and place it back in my mailbox without even going inside or just not open my door?

				Or you can hide it somewhere not in your house. I don&#039;t think they do controlled drops where they give you the package and wait, do they?

If you know that you are having a controlled drop initiated either do one of two things. Answer the door, say you weren&#039;t expecting a package and THEN go and get the marker to write the return address on it and give it back OR just clean house and don&#039;t be in when the postman comes. If they are doing a controlled drop then they are watching your house, if they are watching your house they know you are in, if they know you are in and you don&#039;t answer the door all that does is make them aware you know they are trying to control-drop you.<br /><br />Hope this is of some use to you.<br />
