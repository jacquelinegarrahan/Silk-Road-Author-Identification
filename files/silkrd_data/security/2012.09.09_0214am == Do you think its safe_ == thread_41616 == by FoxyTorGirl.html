				Somebody was looking and asking me questions via the email about some of my listings, a day later I received a letter saying - <br />&quot;<br />I need your help.<br /><br />Hi!<br />I&#039;m waiting for you to confirm we know each other. It will help my credibility on SkillPages.<br />&quot;<br /><br />Do you think it&#039;s safe to go on SkillPages (following the confirmation link of course) and register a user with all my real info? :D<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to be a bitch and not help his credibility....&nbsp; ::)

				Not quite sure on exactly whats going on here but if someone has messaged you on SR or through the email you have provided on SR and asked you to register to a website to confirm whether you know them or not then i strongly advise you to end communication with this person and never register on that site.&#039;<br /><br />If someone in real life knows you are on this website then they can contact you in person,&nbsp; they would never ask you to register to some website.<br /><br />Its probably someone trying to phish account details or possibly (i doubt it) LE.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t worry ODB, the question was mainly rhetoric, I just thought that this whole thing was really hilarious and wanted to share it with the community,<br /><br />Thanks for the concern though :-*
