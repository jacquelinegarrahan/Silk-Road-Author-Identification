				Oh dear. Just to be safe I&#039;d clear all drugs and drug paraphernalia from that address. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve done that already though.<br /><br />I hope this doesn&#039;t start to become a trend.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing who this is.<br /><br />Also, just a thought. You didn&#039;t taunt them in any way did you? It sounds like a threat that might not actually be carried through. Bad English etc.

				I&#039;m not sure what this is?&nbsp; You start by saying you ordered from a trusted seller and it sounds like your not sure what this happened but then you say you&#039;ve been setup and know how these folk are, I&#039;m not getting it.<br /><br />How is this a warning, you didn&#039;t give any information that would help others not get into the same mess.

Admittedly I have dropped off a bit in terms of speed with the huge volume of orders I am working through and long incoherent messages swapped with blufields, who I believe is posting under the name Joolz here. I have said exactly this to Joolz/Edar but have yet to receive a response with any information on my dual personality besides that both of them are both nasty people.

				Our conversation is now a matter of public record. <br /><br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/boi/index.php?show=1885<br /><br /><br />To all those who haven&#039;t seen this before, which is everyone but blufields (Joolz to you lot), this is every message I have exchanged with this gentleman. If anyone can find a point where I have done wrong, or could do better, please let me know. The only edits I have made have been to the address in question, as apparently it is the home of a sickly old man. Some of it has been kept, but this was already on the forums, and was kept to illustrate this fact. Please read all links, fully rather than in blufields manner, so you don&#039;t send me the same questions repeatedly. I have put junk characters in the body of the address, but in the same format, as it seemed I had to circle the differences before blufields could spot them. <br /><br />Starts at the bottom. I know there is a bit missing, but that was cut off the original message I got from what appeared at the time to be a distraught buyer. <br /><br />In my only response to Joolz directly, I will say I can not respond to messages until I have read them. <br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this 200+ line mess. I&#039;m off to smoke some Templeball...<br /><br />Peace

Will type this working my way through the message from you, so maybe a bit of discontinuity.<br /><br />Literally just used the address (copied to print). Did nothing else with it. Did think it a bit weird but some places have different address formats, especially smaller towns.<br />That address from the message is slightly different from the one I have. 1) No U.K at the end 2) The same lack of caps in the post code, but different caps in the address.<br /><br />******<br />******<br />*******<br />*******<br />****<br />That is what I got, minus the name. This is different, not the same.<br /><br />I have never heard of anananaexpress, a forum search showed them selling shitty maroccan. Nothing to do with me, I deal with Asia, not the middle east. I also have no contact with any other seller of hash. I have got warning from vendor support about various messages similar to this, one sent to some vendors says the person has them on video going to post boxes in the US, and as anyone can make an account here I wouldn&#039;t put too much worry in it, but that they have the address is something of concern. There appeared no point to these messages, apart from that the link in them might lead to a site with java that can be manipulated to reveal true IP if ToR is not configured right.<br /><br />OK, now I have read through them all, and what sense I can find in your writing makes me ask you one question: why would I do that? Setting up a new account, finding what ever website that is, doing all the deliberate misspelling. That is far more work than putting the hash in an envelope, chucking a stamp on and getting paid.<br /><br />Ah, ok. I have searched a forum, a vendor has posted some messages they exchanged with you, and you do not come off well. There I can even see a good part of the address in question. And it appears you also annoyed them, using the same address. So there are many people with that info that may want to scare you, or even report you to the police who have actual motivation to do so. Your order has been cancelled. Please do not place an order with me again, it will be cancelled. I dislike being called a grass, especially when there is no grounds for doing so. May I suggest you look to the tone of your messages in order to have happier communications with vendors.<br /><br />Peace &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete

				reply&nbsp; &nbsp; lol&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />chemdogsunrise(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there<br /><br />Well, I can tell you how it is packaged, but I cannot tell you if the address is compromised. The postman would either have had to have had the address marked as one receiving mail for the taking for some reason, or be superman with x-ray vision and a sniffer dogs nose on crack. :-)<br /><br />[REDACTED]<br /><br />Really, I don&#039;t know what else to say to you at this stage. RM have been known to have regional backlogs, but I cannot imagine they have one at the moment. I cannot remember where I sent your order to, as a whole bunch of other stuff went out the same day, so I do not even have a route to check.<br /><br />I will work my butt off to help rectify this situation, but let me be clear. I am not a rich vendor. We are a struggling family and I have 0.09 btc in my account at the moment. If this were another place and another time, I would either just reship or fully refund. But it isn&#039;t, so I can&#039;t, and I hate that.<br /><br />I bought that cheese to get me through some &quot;issues&quot; and sold the 1/8th to help pay for that. It is for that reason I cannot just send you some more or just go out and buy you some more btc or something. In my world view, I would *love* to do that.<br /><br />But that is not your issue. Your issue is that you bought a product that didn&#039;t arrive. Assuming that I haven&#039;t sent it, which is where my responsibility exists as detailed in the above process we follow for every order, you want me to send the product or send the money back.<br /><br />Since I sent the order on Friday afternoon before last post, I can only assume one of the following:<br /><br />* Incorrect address supplied<br />* Sender or receiver is &quot;marked&quot; in some way<br />* Delayed somewhere in RM<br />* Lifted by the postman, as you have suggested<br /><br />This is the first item I&#039;ve had not arrive, and we&#039;ve defeated the customs of the likes of Sweden, the USA and Canada with our packaging. We hate unethical business and scammers, so we are sworn against it. If we don&#039;t like the feeling we get from a particular order, we cancel it and apologise - no messing around and no fiddling. For us to win, we need people like you to win.<br /><br />Not sure what to say now other than to please wait. If it comes to it, let it go to resolution.

				I never understand anything you are talking about joolz.&nbsp; I cannot imagine what you are like in person.&nbsp; Why are you posting their shipping technique?&nbsp; I see you constantly trying to sell drugs and make a quick buck but you really really don&#039;t seem very intelligent.&nbsp; Prison is not a fun place joolz and people like you are used for punching bags and pinch cushions in the pen...<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Thank you moderator for deleting that detailed packaging description that joolz posted above.

I bet you are sound as a pound in the real world and I&#039;d love to share a bevvy with a fellow countryman (assuming you were born there), but this is the SR and its business.<br /><br />Either the weed is there tomorrow, or we&#039;ll start the refund process.<br /><br />Again, very sorry for the ill feeling.

				Morning. Vendors have a similar style, and when they get messages as unintelligible as yours, they tend to make their messages as clear as they can and write with a bit more formality in vain hopes of getting a reply with content of some worth. <br /><br />And Chemdog said in the thread I directed you towards initially that he was going through withdrawal, which would make him an ex junkie. You still not read that thread yet? Besides which, junkies, like drug dealers, tend to avoid any encounters with the police. They are generally more interested in the guy slinging for years without a trace than the guy who chickened out of buying 2 grams of awesome hash. Bit sad you&#039;re now relying on the jump from junkie to grass to prove a fraction of your point. What about all the proof?<br /><br />You lied about not having a reply to the message, which is clear from the whole thing I posted.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164643.msg1197920#msg1197920">Quote from: joolz on June 04, 2013, 09:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and for the record I dont give a fuk if your pope john paul the second&nbsp; or some cock suking junkie.NEVER EVER THREATEN ME OR&nbsp; MY FRIENDS&nbsp; WITH THE PIGS <br />the lads are here that you tried to threaten and bully he,s asking if you want his mobile number ?&nbsp; Since your so fuking tough&nbsp; defo want to meet you<br /><br />&nbsp;I ORDERED FROM YOU AND BANG GOT THREATENED WITH THE POLICE WITHIN&nbsp; 12 HOURS,<br /><br />&nbsp;Had months and loads of transactions without any hassle(Last time was hassle/threats/lies from chemdogsunrise ) TILL I BUMPED INTO YOU AGAIN ...under another alias <br /><br />&nbsp;MONTHS &amp; LOADS OF TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT ANY HASSLE TILL I BUMPED INTO&nbsp; CHEMDOGSUNRISE AKA CHEMDOG&nbsp; <br /><br />and YOU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SONNI&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unlike Chendog, I have no desire to meet you.

You write like you speak in your accent and I only sent one parcel to Scotland on Friday.<br />&nbsp;<br />One thing stood out to me about that address label - how the first line and first number of the second line were structured:<br />&nbsp;<br />*-*<br />&nbsp;* somewhere land<br />&nbsp;<br />I knew from your stats that you had done this enough for that probably not to be a mistake. If it was an error somehow, by either party, perhaps that information would help you locate it if it has ended up at a nearby property?<br />&nbsp;<br />Really hoping RM bring you some love today.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 month&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;read<br />delete

				fuking hell&nbsp; &nbsp; :o<br /><br />&quot;I sell Customer information, we all big vendors M***** and *** (big sellers) all buy each other details.&nbsp; this why the other company had also the same information. Ill explain suppose Mr A has a deadline for the orders she has linted time to move all the hot stuff about quickly. the last&nbsp; any top vendor is going to ant is stuff which is payed for but is simply lying about. so using this information she can then find the correct address and send it right away without waiting fir the clients reposes.&nbsp; But the man principles of this is it can be used for marketing the right goods for the right target audience. It makes market segmentation so much more easier to understand., See these as M****l reports but also including consumer exact demographics. However this is now my intellectual Property.&nbsp; when this is passed on we all know who buy what and who scams who. so when they scammed someone else ***&nbsp; know they don&#039;t even bother sending as we think they are most likely to do the same.&nbsp; there more then about 20 i think which are strong contributors.&nbsp; can you tell **** he owes for the last report. on January please.<br /><br />folk on here&nbsp; know exactly what I mean&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; :-X

				well the real ***** got done by police about in January i believe.&nbsp; ever since then we stopped sharing information with him. this because he delayed money he owned me for previous data. Which is still outstanding, He grassed&nbsp; saying About business and that i had more information of about *******., all his mail is being sent by Police. They are building information on all vendors especially the tops one like&nbsp; *****&nbsp; and *****.&nbsp; &nbsp;*****&nbsp; supply them with&nbsp; Gear hes the ring leader he has also a few on BMR doing the same tricks.
