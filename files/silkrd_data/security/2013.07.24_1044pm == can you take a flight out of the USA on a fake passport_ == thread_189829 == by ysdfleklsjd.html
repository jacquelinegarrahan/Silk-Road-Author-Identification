				as an example, using a forged EU passport (fake name, but with your real photo on it) and stepping on a flight from new york to panama.<br /><br />would that work?<br /><br />or would TSA find out your passport is fake the moment they scan it?<br /><br />what are the scanners checking for when the airport people scan your passport?<br /><br />do you need to be on a computer database in order for your ticket to not be flagged with an &quot;S&quot; (for suspicious)?<br /><br />can you use a passport that doesn&#039;t have a barcode? can you leave the country without your passport needing to be in a database?<br /><br />if there is an experienced expat on this forum that has the answers to any or all of these questions that&#039;d be awesome.

				Multiple countries now have passports with the pictures and information encoded into a chip embedded in them, so physically changing the photo on it wouldn&#039;t work because it wouldn&#039;t match the photo that would show up on their terminal when they scanned it.<br /><br />If you chose to use a passport from a country that doesn&#039;t use an embedded chip in their passports, you still have to find a way to explain how you got into the country in the first place.

				Microwaving is interesting as a way to kill the chip. I wonder if a person could use a no oxygen environment to prevent fire. Flood the microwave with nitrogen. Though I still think a simple hammer might be the easiest way to ruin the chip.

				Drive across the Mexican border to Tijuana with a fake passport. Then take a flight. <br />Where I live they buy passports off people for $5,000 a pop. So you &#039;lose&#039; it, and then after the criminal uses it you report it stolen. <br /><br />

				The way it was explained to me a while back when I traveled abroad was this: Technically you don&#039;t need a passport to get on a plane for an international flight.&nbsp; But when you land in that other country you go through customs where they inspect your passport.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t like it then you can&#039;t enter the country.&nbsp; In practice airlines will check your passport as you board the plane to make sure people have it and in their possession (ie not checked in baggage) as you go through customs before getting your luggage.<br /><br />When I visited (name of country here) a while back (somewhere between 9-11 in 2001 and 2010) they looked at my passport, typed what I assumed was my passport&#039;s id into a computer, asked where I was going and how long the visit was, stamped it and was on my way.&nbsp; Mine doesn&#039;t have an rfid chip in it although it&#039;s coming up for renewal soon and I&#039;m sure it will have then.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll just buy some lead panels about the size of a passport :)<br /><br />What I&#039;m getting at is they didn&#039;t really do any detailed inspection of the country I was entering.&nbsp; Coming back though I remember US customs be pretty picky and taking their time.&nbsp; Man, I&#039;ve driven into canada before and going into canada they basically just wanted to know where I was going and if I had any guns (&#039;MURICA!), coming back to US I was welcomed with what seemed like an interrogation, having to open my trunk for them to look through it, etc.&nbsp; Remember last couple trips it again turned in to a similar story on air travel.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t need a passport to drive in to canada, but I required one to come back into US (wtf?) so at the canada customs they made sure we had passports.

				Been a few years since I&#039;ve been across the border to Canada but similar experiences with me. We were supposed to have our BC with us, not all of us did(stupid females, literally the dumbest person I&#039;ve met). Canada was like hey thats all fine and dandy but good luck on the other side, eh. We kinda chuckled and didn&#039;t think anything of it. Coming back...&quot;ok, please pull ahead to garage door #1, it will open as you pull up. Pull all the way inside and shut the vehicle off, they will instruct you from there. Have a nice day.&quot; Went through all our shit, brought a dog in that actually didn&#039;t alert. We didn&#039;t have anything on us at all, but we were daily smokers so the car I&#039;m sure was not &quot;clean&quot;.<br /><br />Had to service a border agents office one day and never even left the country, had a valid customs letter signed from an hour before with the border agent approving and I still got interrogated like a mofo. That time I actually wasn&#039;t clean because on long trips I liked to bring my chilm and smoke...wasn&#039;t planning on going over the border that day but they sprung it on me when I got up there. I was more than a little nervous. Almost left my backpack on the side of the road to grab later lol
