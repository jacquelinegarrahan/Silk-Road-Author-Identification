				I tried to place two orders this weekend, and both times they were canceled because the PGP message was not readable. This was a bit confusing, as I&#039;ve had no problems at least a dozen times in the past. <br /><br />I don&#039;t use persistent drive option, but the routine has always been for me : <br /><br />* Go to vendor page and copy their PGP key. <br />* In tails, highlight the clipboard, and click &quot;MANAGE KEYS&quot;, click edit and PASTE (imports the PGP key)<br />* Open the application for Openoffice writer, type my information, select all, and COPY. <br />* Back over to the clipboard icon,&nbsp; and click Sign/Encrypt Cipboard with Public Keys. Select the imported name, then paste that into the appropriate box in the order process. <br /><br />The part that bugs me most is I&#039;ve had no problem in the newbie PGP thread before, and have placed orders no problem before this. Now that I think about it, I just updated Tails recently, but the verification said everything was OK. Next time I hit up the coffee shop, I plan to redownload Tails and do another install, but in the meantime I was curious if anyone else had this issue.

				It could be something as simple as the paste put linebreaks in your message.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had that happen a few times to me.&nbsp; My way around it is to unwrap the message body (ie remove all formatting) and then paste.

Use gedit instead -- you&#039;ll have a LOT less issues, plus with gedit you can encypt/decrypt from right within the editor. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				Son of a bitch, I never once thought about the font being copied and pasted over. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be doing a few test runs before trying to annoy that vendor again, thank you.
