				The stupidity of people in general amazes me.<br /><br />If the contract killer *was* an undercover agent, then why are they saying there&#039;s no record of the death?&nbsp; whoever was running the agent would know the full story and since so many agencies were involved in this, you would have assumed one of them would have put their hand up to it by now or at least the agent would have bothered to ask around, rather than putting together this sketchy tale.&nbsp; If this is the standard of LE in the US then it really does appear to be more good luck than good judgement that anyone is ever caught.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s only the warrant request but you can drive a truck through the holes in some of the story.<br /><br />

There was another one that supposedly took place in Canada that authorities claim to not be able to corroborate.

				ooops.&nbsp; it&#039;s been a couple of days since I read the document - that&#039;s my excuse and I&#039;m sticking to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll just say then that if I were paying 80k for a murder then I would expect there to be no trace, an unmarked grave is expected.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t get is why they haven&#039;t checked missing persons, since if someone did get it in the neck then you&#039;d expect someone would have reported them missing.&nbsp; has anyone tried to track down the person?&nbsp; I could be mistaken but I thought it was an old employee and afaik there&#039;s at least one person who has claimed to be in contact with each of them after they&#039;ve gone.&nbsp; certainly for nomad and for scout (although I think scout should be safe because he didn&#039;t go until this year).<br /><br /><br />the joys of speculation huh?<br /><br />
