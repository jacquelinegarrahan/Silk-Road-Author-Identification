				Hello All&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I am still new here and am looking to upgrade to Tails in the near future. I am currently using Tor with bridge relays in place so I&#039;m not connected directly to the public Tor network. Apparently this prevents somebody watching your internet traffic from knowing you&#039;re using Tor..<br /><br />My question is does Tails automatically prevent this record of Tor from being logged in your internet traffic or do you need to configure it to do so? Is this even possible?<br /><br />Any help anyone can give would be absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Thanks Guys&nbsp; :D

				No ;D<br /><br /><br />Use a VPN if you are trying to hide your TOR usage from your ISP. ::)

				Be very careful picking out a VPN provider. Most are utter shit and will role over to LE at the first sign of trouble. <br /><br />The good ones I can count on one hand. Do a lot of research and start here http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/ and read in between the lines carefully before making your choice.

				You can use bridges to hide your Tor use.<br /><br />OpenVPN doesn&#039;t work on Tails, but some routers support it. If you can setup the VPN on your router, that will work too.<br />

				@astor<br /><br />Yeah thanks for the help champ! I just found out you can use a &#039;bridge mode&#039; with Tails so I think that is the way I am going to go!<br /><br />Thanks for all the assistance everyone :)

I would of thought anything that add&#039;s security and plausible deniaibility would be encouraged by the developers.
