				One of the major things when picking a VPN is to find out where their servers are located. Make sure it&#039;s not in the States. Here&#039;s a few that i know of:<br /><br />TorGuard(Servers in Romania, Netherlandsm Ukraine, and Panama)<br />Ipredator(based in Sweden)<br />

				ACtually being in the states can actually be a good thing. What you really want is one located somewhere that the law does not require them to keep logs. Lots of countries do, which means they can track you after the fact. If no logs are kept, even if they approach your VPN provider, they will have no useful information to hand over. Which counts out every VPN in europe, they have to keep logs. Soon australia will also have similar laws, and the USA is working on it, but do not require it yet.<br /><br />I think.....always do your own research, but that is the conclusion i have come to.

				are you doing tor-vpn? or just vpn? cause if its just vpn then you will want it in a nonwestern country, but if its with tor then probably better inside your own.

				AirVPN would be my recommendation. They don&#039;t keep logs, take BTC, have lots of guides, great customer service and have a Don&#039;t Know Your Customer policy&nbsp; ;D

				My experience with Private Internet Access has been very good - as other&#039;s have said, they claim not to keep ANY logs which means even if some entity manages to track you back through Tor, they will arrive at a VPN that holds no logs to confirm who and where you are. Combine this with payment through btc, using an anonymous email and all should be fine.<br /><br />PB.
