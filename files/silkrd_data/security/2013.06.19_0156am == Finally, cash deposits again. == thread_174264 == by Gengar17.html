				So I recently got BitInstant cash deposit to work as a guest user. You just have to use a real name attached to a real birthday, pretty easy to find on Facebook, social networks etc. If anyone has any questions about how I did it, I am welcome to answer them. :)<br /><br />I had a question about sending BTC from BitInstant straight to my SR address. Is this safe? I just got a new BTC address that I haven&#039;t used on any transactions, as far as they know it&#039;s just a random wallet right?

				Real name attached to a real birthday? Do you mean you have to know the birthday of the particular name? How would they know whether or not the birthday was fake? Do they have an SSN database?

				yur safe mate&nbsp; :)<br /><br />and yeah it&#039;s ok to send bitinstant&gt; SR wallet. the coins get tumbled before they reach your actual SR account. some people like to spend a little extra and tumble the coins themselves even further.<br />your choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				Thanks a bunch ChemCat!

I assume they have a database, I tried a bunch of times using fake names/fake birthdays with real names, and nothing worked. I kept getting a message like &quot;we are having a problem with one of our partners, try again soon.&quot; or something along those lines.

They are a private company, not the NSA (unless....).<br /><br />That would be crazy. It probably just didn&#039;t load right or something until that time when you had a correct birthday. <br /><br />Unless they are doing background checks instantly on every name that attempts to get put in. That would be a serious attempt at fraud prevention, but also sort of crazy. <br /><br />In the end, I doubt they have a database.

				Keep doubting, they definitely do. <br /><br />If you still don&#039;t believe me, try some fake names/birthdays compared to real names and birthdays. When you try to verify your account, they ask a lot more out of you and know details down to how much a person&#039;s house cost or what year their car is.
