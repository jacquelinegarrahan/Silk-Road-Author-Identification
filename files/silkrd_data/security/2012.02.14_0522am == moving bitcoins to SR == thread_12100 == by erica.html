				I don&#039;t use MtGox, but I&#039;ve read in other threads that you cannot transfer straight from there to SR because they are able to somehow recognise that your SR wallet is hidden via the Tor network. I believe this may result in MtGox halting all of your transactions and asking you for ID.<br /><br />It&#039;s better to be safe than sorry. Just add another layer of distance between you and SR by using a wallet or two in between. Instawallet will do fine.<br /><br />There are a lot of other threads available on this issue, so try doing a couple of searches for more info.

Just make sure that you access these intermediate wallets over tor. So, if you use Instawallet, access it over your tor browser. And if you use your bitcoin wallet on the PC, set it up to use the tor proxy. The idea is to disconnect these wallets from your identity (IP address etc.).

				You can send bc directly to SR from Mt. Gox but you can&#039;t do it over Tor. But if your Mt. Gox account is anonymous (and tied to a Tormail account - and somebody please correct me if I&#039;m wrong - it can&#039;t be tied to you unless they seize your computer and analyze it. Even if LE suspects a suspicious IP address is doing it, can they really prove it was specifically you doing the transfers?

				Mt. Gox will work with LE whenever they feel it necessary, they have openly stated this. <br /><br />Even if you created the mt gox account anonymously, you are still connecting to it with your IP address, and you are still paying for the bitcoins with a creditcard which is yours i assume...<br /><br />Mt gox simply hands over the logs which states your home ip address connected and logged in with the same account that transferred bc&#039;s to silkroad...<br /><br />Ofc this is assuming that SR has been infiltrated, but why cut corners when it comes to being as secure as possible?

				If you bought your coins through MtGox then there is information tying you to those coins.&nbsp; It might just be your IP address, or your bank account, or some other method you used to pay for those coins, but you&#039;ve probably been ID&#039;d.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your only hope is to send those coins through several different destinations before they get to SR.&nbsp; Bitcoin fog might help.&nbsp; Bitcoins are easily tracked -- they are numbered -- so all you can do is transfer them to intermediary destinations so you can say that someone else had control of the coins when they were sent to SR.

				One thing to remember when dealing with Instawallet is to copy the full link to the wallet.&nbsp; When you go to www.instawallet.org a new wallet is generated with it&#039;s own Bitcoin address for receiving payments.&nbsp; It&#039;s not enough to copy ONLY the Bitcoin address.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need the link (which will look something like https://www.instawallet.org/w/27g6NxTbNhXab57jKlZ32) or you&#039;ll never be able to access the coins you sent to that Bitcoin address.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you send Bitcoins to an Instawallet address and forget to bookmark the link to that wallet don&#039;t feel too bad, it&#039;s happened to plenty of other people.&nbsp; But you are, unfortunately, SOL.&nbsp;

I think it&#039;s very likely it&#039;ll happen though, maybe this server will get owned, maybe there&#039;ll be a fed-run sting market, maybe a vendor who sells both drugs and bitcoins gets arrested/turned, whatever.

You might want to rethink your strategy...

				Erica, I don&#039;t understand why they want documentation. Did you sign on through Tor? Are you just trying to withdraw your bc to a private wallet or to SR. I&#039;ve most recently only used a cash deposit -&gt; bitinstant/cashtrust -&gt; Mt. Gox -&gt; SR and have never had a problem. Can you give us all details as to what happened?
