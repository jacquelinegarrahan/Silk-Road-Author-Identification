				All shell commands will be in code tags. Output from GPG to the terminal will be in quote tags. My comments are simply text.<br /><br />To use GPG&nbsp; you need to generate a key pair. This consists of a public key and a private key. It is safe to give the public key to anyone who you correspond with, the private key should not be shared with anyone else. You can think of the public key as being an open lock, which you give to the people who you want to be able to communicate securely with you. You can image it as the people you have shared your open lock (public key) with putting their messages to you in a secure box and locking it shut by closing your open lock on it. Now even they can not open the lock. You keep the private key yourself, in a combination safe. The combination to the safe is your passphrase. After providing your passphrase, the combination safe is opened and the private key is used to unlock you closed lock and take the message out. GPG doesn&#039;t actually require that you understand much of this, simply that you know the basics of public and private keys. <br /><br />Let&#039;s generate a key pair from the command line:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">gpg --gen-key</code><br />you will be presented with a series of questions regarding the key you are generating<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please select what kind of key you want:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) RSA and RSA (default)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) DSA and Elgamal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) DSA (sign only)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) RSA (sign only)<br />Your selection? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is simply asking you which encryption algorithms you would like to use for session key encryption and signature. It doesn&#039;t particularly matter the selection you make as all of the options are secure, however you will want to select either option one or two as three and four are used for signatures only. I will go with the default of RSA and RSA, so I enter 1 and press enter. <br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">1</code><br />Now you will be asked the strength you would like to make the keys.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.<br />What keysize do you want? (2048) </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Generally you will want to go with the strongest possible choice, 1,024 bit keys are currently considered to be somewhat secure but they are probably crackable by agencies such as NSA and will not be secure against less powerful attackers for very long. I will select 4,096, which should remain secure for quite a long time.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">4096</code><br />Now you will be asked how long the key should remain valid for<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Please specify how long the key should be valid.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 = key does not expire<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; = key expires in n days<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;n&gt;w = key expires in n weeks<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;n&gt;m = key expires in n months<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;n&gt;y = key expires in n years<br />Key is valid for? (0) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Chances are that you want your key to always be recognized as valid by the people you communicate with.

Failure to do this will result in pissed off vendors and may very well end up with you being ignored, as nobody wants to spend the time required to figure out which key belongs to you.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">kmfkewm</code><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Email address:</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For email address you can either put a legitimate (anonymous) email address that you can be reached at, or something made up.

This is especially important if you are in a virtual machine, as there is not a mechanical hard drive to be used a source of randomness. During the process of gathering entropy, mathematic symbols are printed to the screen, seemingly for your amusement.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">........+++++</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Eventually your key will be generated, as signaled by something like this<br /><br />note: this doesn&#039;t match the key I actually generated because my terminal fucked up.

Private keys are used in the message decryption process.<br /><br />let&#039;s export the public key <br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code"> gpg -a --export kmfkewm@silkroad.onion </code><br />-a signals that the output is ascii armored and --export is the flag to export a public key. You need to make sure to specify the e-mail address of the public key you would like to export or else it will export all of your public keys as one huge ascii armor block. I believe it is also possible to do it by username, however it seems to easily be confused, as when I specified it export kmfkewm it was exporting my real key which has the username of KmfkeWm, but when I specify by email address it works as expected. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />mQINBFBPGkYBEAC+ORsJzjE3AhgWXS9MplXQMYe8JqCjmIzp9tTu5t+v8OlS2ibx<br />WqFPCsP/gD+lumnPy9zhwC1TnspcXdU8kfepK5xsrKBfGzBJ17kdkdsgAR5yQOj3<br />uO1thsI8e9diJaSPfJofNpsWHi93gNUNRyp+W128QebwOIMnMkF35s3X2nqKlY4O<br />NBXEIUBtEiI7D+qVWONLrdH9OXpOAJVYXBqFA+azF+isebLZ2TC1wrU5edMPGt1d<br />K9DPn7BSc3fOsIj6eR316if7Qu6dG2By9jG6ZVV7Ffvovw0tgeiQbm2aJMHdm3MU<br />NMrALmb6mxhgn3nYqkNFqX7UfKY3QF2ewaynseqliBEUtEDLHzD+93PT6+/jDyjS<br />LOc8ZUDIobfeUlk8TxwBGf6XG/o3Jca/6Ae3oRuFyLYM+yYmaQwldEaaVHn1AQPx<br />GpxEvoJ7Yfl7tbafCA5RBZ79x7kaslJiC+bh9yEzconof56H/awNHBrQUJB+vGjT<br />VjaErCsTOgE2vjPIwRvaZKo71s/tFXpw0wUd3owxoKr29dvQKgJRXycuikk8kJWF<br />G7WFpHlpYBiuLCKNFIIzeBX2FsvK3JVywMVlPXO1nkNJcjzTOpmhSm4Rei2btgql<br />aiKUax+elHE0aEGrt/zuAKkRVtaOQ483ZH+jkssaAuduAnoAX5ANfgp/ZwARAQAB<br />tDxrbWZrZXdtICh0aGUgZW1haWwgYWRkcmVzcyBpcyBmYWtlKSA8a21ma2V3bUBz<br />aWxrcm9hZC5vbmlvbj6JAjgEEwECACIFAlBPGkYCGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQW<br />AgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEGReY/Kkoi17n4kQAI505WN2FodXMZlU+aOfNep9k4bIeV41<br />NRMqOLDqip0nzL05ZsbP9cvpHdsMlSZ7DHwQ9L7ms7EhKACeHK1X6Ens13N1RNOH<br />cVGuiZERMKM/Jpc7M3GEIfhSK0tTzGKVi33Iwc0EGYkqYGAGFSfx0awhs/qVBxDp<br />ja0/cf+PeBkGOeb3DgHnQBJ+JG/l3KmQIa0T4/e1g71pL1InvSdA0YsLuxglCrMZ<br />T+hDo1lPdmuUjLRahrHw29eNtJsH6wkyfC7fmpDwdwwy9bfE9H0tI9zFnrJ7xyy2<br />yMWxaoPIkrWHXuAqHqXpCqljy4J+Yi85o2KbnZwRiKFVj9kYQYyjEEa4C/WMkYxp<br />6JLGaNpReK0KurJiSBa0fpjRvMN8zaEdkHNEtSwbJV2c8aFuHYvlA8ForjPT3kZ7<br />qrDGMVe7b8BkF82XTLvTyFZ6n+1T9fXTZjTlwHWr3xjrXoRjNH4Y/sgwWEU681WV<br />Ct9Q5l1ecyq3NrhVQWsZp3Mfm9EwFxN1i55uccQtZSomEsQ+e7XsExSB6fPtdPHA<br />WU4Hcphjyx5T4rRats4Mj3B+KH5lRNRJdGM9s9nX/1c/CQ+vg1eqifJvyjI2jvYW<br />HXW/J3iOSp4woRNPKPJy0YMbDMFevMOQ4M9JFkOoH+CQ4VLWTdMKPaaIosPRofm+<br />7JpQGJeAH1b2uQINBFBPGkYBEAD5+/TrHjszZzX58ajyJEedU1AB53P3yPrwKmH8<br />jnU6cLtn4mj4hhothKckVSReJkr6nuHc6CfWG1AUBxhcS4PNg8Otn/HK6/HvWnL9<br />hsqXxs9D9h0j5TNzoCNCGsYmjDWkClOHqSwZBvrROvmzAbMbIYWQls8JXRyArF4U<br />Fb7szRSfuQUEAgHkqBV54bUm/Dt5SIZgp1DhIIoeXaQptvE13pnBnuE4en0hBqTI<br />ZcYb+eyCjeAnXjztl6JX418k4GRbWMIYjK3Gu1QHKLhyhaFpk5awGkHUAwmPk1wd<br />hdiQacBQKrv2//23Qx6Ad7W+RtpsjlcxoMivrHJbZ4m54zqlP/ZJDSUcq9zLo/+/<br />r3eo7nv8qTUUNDKOL0VJUgH2a+th1RwFqxjf+q4BSRwg+YzQwMVlX9EUntj1ZW7o<br />c2K1AXciVb4cov5m6xUz8pSrVXhCEkLixaNfYGv14dCwJFVszIMAwTi5Lrdo+g/4<br />P1Nj8Ttg32lq5gyCNgKj4wrkCDGeaj7o32AwhfhB9hTPJQfLi6D3N7XtNS6e2YME<br />a5+WXklgxbWgMJvu4+zBNvgzzNNxMpgZVp3ScPKSPQI6ehLzuXtRcH8xUGPS/02b<br />tSoFz24bXS+kzzM7YraV+opy7g0Vrq++CeUKLg83qafscc6UW235VjTkc6UzVFHu<br />KHLtiwARAQABiQIfBBgBAgAJBQJQTxpGAhsMAAoJEGReY/Kkoi17Rl0P/jeafez9<br />vRVQYLi/7cuxXC25Shiu/D3/19ucaOTQRmWEYXbLYTqS7IaeI80POh+FwTqye7gg<br />3zW1O3cBGTyups44vvDJWbwTl8G3sMK/dSP3QWoThq1ooNzi9+MWahXWtmj2qJBn<br />UJh0fnFMzPEK0EYWWdwX+crffiUmM9fNC2qDP/WZXMWbXEHqFcjDrrq3mFWYKMSD<br />5jUM8o3yMngUoa4+VN4G9KbqbF91CzSnOSlwpVUIkwFOv1C3iBcAgj8lHGD+Zv18<br />V+uayZSSwek7w84w1oiTtfRPxPUrsuexA07jkh0F4YQFkbWaIPUFuekRwwl1thT5<br />nRe/IsxIXh/Qfcnrf5uuxM0gVjNh1RvgyqgmCo361odX329hL4wY/OKcppVXbmnr<br />kUEQROvbPIZYG5mJlr12HXvZ67hQlWLUVw/w6zoPSkq2+pP+x72WCwnodwLXw6Uw<br />vMSz0ZDSDAVJ6kSGuxp/nvsMMQA004rIJInbDx4f/uGbUm0GbTpbMxb/SWPRqgcn<br />KRn0ZtkY9e+nTvGRMiahNQ/p2F77jVgVZYTM7QC2sDdQYFeJHQDGEX3HZANK51/5<br />FcUwaMMUYbDZFfrLL6aLUbJvVX/vl+qIUMmZTKhqNQSICIWD2NJ8VqdMhfgIviFQ<br />BTMSc5GKuWYmpdkX4xwW+hWbPY0ZTP8F0wsa<br />=IZ3p<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When people want you to be able to send them encrypted messages they will send you a copy of their public keys and you will need to import them.

You can image it as the people you have shared your open lock (public key) with putting their messages to you in a secure box and locking it shut by closing your open lock on it. Now even they can not open the lock. You keep the private key yourself, in a combination safe. The combination to the safe is your passphrase. After providing your passphrase, the combination safe is opened and the private key is used to unlock you closed lock and take the message out. GPG doesn&#039;t actually require that you understand much of this, simply that you know the basics of public and private keys. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We always need more ways of using visual metaphors to explain PGP. I find once people &quot;get&quot; one of the visual metaphors, they are much much less likely to get confused or make elementary mistakes, even if they don&#039;t fully understand the particular procedure on their OS and PGP GUI implementation. Because of this, I intend to use a lot of different visualizations to represent the exact same thing when my tutorials are completed. People&#039;s brains are often just wired differently, something that seems a bit weird and obscure to most people can hold the key to understanding for some other people.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just repetition that is the mother of all learning as it is said, because you can also produce very good parrots this way too, it is also redundancy. I think redundancy in multiple explanation of the same material is a major stumbling block at every level of education.<br /><br />I think the painful truth is that a lot of the elite students in a classroom, were merely the ones that sought an alternative explanation instead of the main textbook&#039;s formalisms, while the rest grind on with a source material that is obstructionist. There is a ton of &quot;magical thinking&quot; going on in high schools and universities these days, but it&#039;s not a new culture. I remember Richard Feynman in a radio broadcast saying that literally every single Brazilian student of engineering, physics he met, had not an iota about what they were reading. The students would all memorize the textbooks, afraid of being left behind in the race for academic credentials.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is what happened:<br /><br />Feynman was in Brazil training students to become teachers (in fact, they were going to be Brazil&#039;s *first* group of science teachers) and he started to discover something rather strange. He could ask a question and the students would answer correctly and adeptly. Then he would ask the same question, the exact same question in the exact same subject, and they wouldn&#039;t understand him at all. He eventually worked out that although he could use a phrase such as &quot;light such that it is reflected through a medium with an index&quot;, the students had no idea that this could mean a *medium meant a material such as, you know, water*. And so, a subtle word alternation meant they couldn&#039;t generate an output.<br /><br />At this rate, human beings who do this, are not any better than a machine. Because that&#039;s what machines do. They process symbols we call data, but do not comprehend the meaning. If you process data, but don&#039;t comprehend what it actually means, then you are a just a machine. The lowest form of intelligence possible! Record! Replicate! That&#039;s as dumb as non-living things like DNA! Even some machines may perform better than a human in this situation!<br /><br />If I wasn&#039;t to be a drug smuggler, I would have wanted to be a teacher, but not only is the economics impossible for you do not get paid even twice for being 10x more effective than the next fellow, but the entire profession is filled with &quot;machines&quot; like the one I just described, who go on to replicate themselves amongst the students they supposedly teach.<br /><br />Lack of money I might have been able to take, I am good with money and can easily turn 1 dollar into 2, but this stupidity? Perpetuating itself because the staff wish to keep the status quo of imbeciles? Never.<br /><br />In my view, 75% of all the teachers in American and European high schools ought to be fired immediately, without any pay or benefit.<br /><br />The 25%, which are mostly just &quot;ok&quot; because they haven&#039;t been sufficiently tainted by the system, or are of unusually persistent character, should then engage with something like Khan Academy, where students learn at home, only coming into the classrooms in order to finish their homework.<br /><br />Would be an improvement?<br /><br />Let me emphasize, that were all the students left entirely to their own devices, they would still obtain a better level of education than they do high schools. This is why I have sympathy for those creationists who take their kids out of schools and home school them instead. It&#039;s not actually just they don&#039;t like evolution being taught to their kids (for which I have no sympathy, I consider evolution theory a very critical idea for reasons beyond just biology), that&#039;s just one single caveat, it&#039;s that they have a problem with the entire system. Maybe they don&#039;t express it as such, but I have a feeling they&#039;ve intuited, correctly, that their kids will be more confident, more educated and have more enthusiasm for things like Science overall, than if they went to a traditional high school.<br /><br />I was at a friend&#039;s house a while back, and they were watching &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot;, a documentary on the American high school system, I didn&#039;t say anything, but I became so angry I had to leave the room, there are things that would make stones weep. If you think I&#039;m joking, go and watch it for yourself.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That sums up the basic commands required to use GPG from the command line.

It&#039;s a psychological hurdle so great that if you only show potential PGP users how to use the command line, you risk losing most of them altogether.
