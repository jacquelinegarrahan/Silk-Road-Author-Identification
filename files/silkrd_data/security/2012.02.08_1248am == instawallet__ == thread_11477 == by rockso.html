				I am considering transferring bitcoins to the site instawallet.org before transferring them to sr because people have said this is safer and more anonymous. My question is has anyone used this site? is it safe/reputable? and i am getting the bitcoins in a complete anonymous way anyway so is there any reason or benefit to use it,could it be safer in the sense of not losing your coins through transactions? thanks again guys

				Instawallet is indeed reputable but anybody who says that using it as a proxy is &quot;safer&quot; or &quot;more anonymous&quot; has given you really shitty advice. If you don&#039;t mind disclosing, how you do you currently get bitcoins?

				I have a similar question, I&#039;m planning on buying bitcoins. I&#039;m getting a bank wire sent to swiftexchanger.com, where its getting transferred into liberty reserve currency. I&#039;m then going to be buying bitcoins using liberty reserve on Mt. Gox. Is transferring the bitcoins from Mt. Gox to a online wallet such as instawallet before transferring it to SR necessary? How anonymous/safe am I staying in general with my current method of funding (bank wire, liberty reserve, Mt. Gox, etc.) with and without using an online wallet?

				Not anonymous, and again, transferring to an online wallet does nothing. You want to use a mix like bitcoin fog or bitlaundry.

				DONT LOSE YOUR URL!<br />and for a little more practical advice DO NOT LOSE YOUR URL!!!!!<br />I like instawallet because it uses a &#039;green&#039; address to transfer the funds out (and my btc comes h2h cash)<br /><br />There&#039;s always going to be a record in the block chain for every transaction that ever happened (by design)<br />hxxxs://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain

				ha whatup other roxxo, are you also a rock and roll clown that does cocaine??? so instawallet does nothing to add to anonymity, how do you use these other sites you mentioned to add anonymity and are they safe.&nbsp;

				I appreciate the advice QTC, but can anyone else share their opinion as well just so I have as much information to go on as possible? Apparently using an online wallet doesn&#039;t increase anonymity, but is using a bitcoin mixer like bitlaundry really necessary considering how I&#039;m currently obtaining my bitcoins? Or would I be relatively safe from LE if I just sent straight from Mt. Gox to the SR? Basically what I&#039;m asking is, what are the chances that all of the financial institutions I&#039;m going through will successively cooperate with LE to gain my identity. I know the privacy policy on swiftexchanger.com says they discard all personal information after the bank wire is completed, and the bank wire is the only real liability I can see in terms of me having given information to people. Every other service I&#039;m using (liberty reserve and mt. gox) was created using a hushmail account and using only my name, which is a relatively common name. I wouldn&#039;t mind waiting an extra week and paying a fee to use bitlaundry to avoid going to prison if its even somewhat likely, but if it&#039;s not I don&#039;t want to waste my money or my time. Thanks in advance for all the responses guys, I know this is a long-winded post :D

Also the &quot;quality of the laundering&quot; of your coins depends on the amount of transactions (other users laundering) happening within the time you have your btc in there.<br /><br />Imho there&#039;s no better mixer than SR. But if you want to go that route don&#039;t use the hidden wiki for your urls to these services, best bet I guess would be this one: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11477.msg107672#msg107672">Quote from: dubious on February 08, 2012, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...what are the chances that all of the financial institutions I&#039;m going through will successively cooperate with LE to gain my identity...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, mt.sux will for sure. Also they&#039;ll freeze your account i.e. just for connecting through tor/vpns and demand copies of legal papers from you. Happened to me and I did not even transfer fiat currency into it, just btc and peanuts at that (~30btc).<br /><br />Bottom line, stay far away from mt.gox if you like it anon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11477.msg107672#msg107672">Quote from: dubious on February 08, 2012, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...I know the privacy policy on swiftexchanger.com says they discard all personal information...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, then you should be fine in any case...
