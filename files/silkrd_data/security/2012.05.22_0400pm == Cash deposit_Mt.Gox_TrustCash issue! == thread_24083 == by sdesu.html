				Hi all,<br />So I made a cash deposit yesterday and my funds still haven&#039;t shown up into my account on Mt.Gox.<br />If it makes any difference, I made the deposit like 10 minutes before they closed (but got a transaction receipt) confirming the deposit. Also, the invoice was for 10 dollars less than I paid. I had given a friend who owed me money a 10 in exchange for a 20, so it put me 10 over, and didn&#039;t feel like asking the bank teller for change. Could this be causing the delay? Or am I just too in a hurry.<br /><br />sdesu

				Email or call TrustCash (info on their site). Sometimes things do slip through the cracks. The $10 difference could be the problem because I believe they use the exact deposit amount and branch to know which deposit is which and where each one is supposed to go to.

				Did you use bitinstant? If so, I think you might want to contact them instead of TC. Keep us updated, I&#039;m curious

				I emailed TrustCash, waited like 4 hours, then went to the bank to deposit more money out of anxiety.<br />Just got home, checked my email, they replied and said it was all taken care of.<br />Checked Mt.Gox, my original amount (minus the $10) was there - so I guess they got a free $10, oh well.<br />And...the additional amount that I had just deposited was there too, surprisingly fast (not even 15 mins after leaving the bank).<br /><br />So now I&#039;m up to 102.64 BTC. yay.<br /><br />Let the drug buying commence!<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				Might be good to ask questions like this over at bitcointalk.org<br /><br />No need to throw out exact amounts either, MtGox, Bitinstant, and Trustcash could all ID you pretty easily from the info in this thread.<br /><br />

				It was definitely because you didn&#039;t deposit the exact amount. The unique amount is used to lookup your order, so if you deposit something else they can&#039;t automate it and will have to match it manually.
