				I was just thinking about this... I&#039;ts clear that vendors SHOULD destroy all records of buyers&#039; addresses once their transactions are complete, but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not the case 100% of the time. I&#039;ve been wondering if any of them would ever look you up on facebook and learn more about your personal life. I&#039;m not sure exactly how my privacy settings on FB are set up, but a search on google came up with my name, picture, and a little summary of things from my profile, including where I work. Now, one would hope that vendors are too busy with business and just not really interested in this information about their customers but really you never know! What do you guys think?

				I do know that its regular practice for vendors to use googlemaps to make sure that the address is valid. I think its a great tool to determine that a package is going to make it... I dont think vendors have time to google everyones name.&nbsp;

				Yes I&#039;m definitely going to change my fb settings, but even with full privacy doesn&#039;t a picture still come up? I read many times that using your real name is ok, and sometimes encouraged. Obviously I still have some learning to do... that&#039;s why I asked the question. Damn noobs!! lol

				@Wonderland<br /><br />Even though you changed your privacy settings FB would still sell your info to advertising companies and some governments, photos included. But not only they use the info you submit to FB, I did read that they also track your cookies and check the websites you visited, not sure if true, but I think this can be perfectly.<br /><br />If you want to keep using facebook so badly, just clean all cookies and temp data before you log in and don&#039;t never ever post anything related to your politic views or anything criticizing status quo. Use facebook for innocent friendly stuff, yet it can also be used against you if you ever try to apply for a job involving much responsibility. <br /><br />Anyway I encourage you to delete your facebook account, don&#039;t support this cancer.

				@Guybrush Threepwood<br /><br />Just about covers it. I don&#039;t have a facebook, but that&#039;s making it increasingly difficult to interact with local businesses who essentially used Facebook as a free platform for their businesses (coupons and updating schedules and such).<br /><br />If I ever get one, I figure I take the following steps:<br />&nbsp;- Open only it&#039;s own sandboxed browser window<br />&nbsp;- block or delete all cookies<br />&nbsp;- post nothing dumb<br />&nbsp;- keep it private (only people I know)<br /><br />I do think it&#039;s possible to keep a &quot;public&quot; internet persona as well as a private one. None of my Tor based activities are known to my friends and family.<br /><br />The &quot;weak link&quot; in the anonymity chain is that most of us must provide our real address (and possibly real name) to the vendor. Until W.A.S.T.E. is up and running that&#039;s a risk we&#039;ll have to take.

FBI profiles FB all the time. One agent takes on ten or so different profiles, post things about drugs or terrorism and then they just reel in the sucker fish. I sometimes wish i had one for political reasons...organizing and what not. But am really glad i never set one up......be safe and don&#039;t forget they also monitor twitter. land of the free? really? just like China. next thing you know they will be sending out drones killing Americans............oh wait ....they are. little off topic but I can&#039;t help myself.....peace

				Maybe it is off-topic but I found it may appropriate here.<br /><br />Google DOES record what you search along with your IP. There is a search engine created to avoid this, it is duckduckgo and was implemented as the main search engine for Tor on the clearnet (yet you can use it on your normal browser).

				I use facebook with a fake name and fake info and have NEVER put my name on anything tor-related, obviously including SR. Drop houses are the way to go, yes it costs me a few bucks a package to have it delivered there but if shit hits the fan and even if my guy rats me out I have certain failsafes in place to protect me

				Just one more reason not to use real information, despite sellers prompting you to. You have to remember that using your real name is strictly protecting the seller and does little for yourself (real name=delivery=they get their money). How much will fake information will help you with denial? No one can really say for sure, only guess, I think there are too many variables to say. <br /><br />Even SR guidelines/rules suggest NOT using a real name/info, a seller asking you to do this is asking you to ignore SR guidelines, created to help keep you safe. Same with sellers asking to finalize early. Do buyers demand sellers&#039; real information? Of course not! Is either at more or less risk/punishment if found than the other? Impossible to know!<br /><br />If you have even just a half a brain, getting it delivered so that none of your real info is given out is possible. <br /><br />Only give real info to sellers you have been doing business with for a bit your real information. You can never fully trust someone to not do something stupid with your information so this trust really needs to be earned, NOT expected. Who knows what they are doing with it, and in the wrong hands, it can be than just your name or where you live (ex. facebook). Real trust is built over time through experience, it isn&#039;t something you just all of a sudden &#039;have a feel for&#039; by talking with someone.<br /><br />Your facebook can be locked down so it does not even show up in a google search. However, that does not stop a seller from trying to find your info on google or facebook and that can be dangerous because your info is still being searched and tracked whether they find your facebook or not.<br /><br />I have see too many threats from sellers on SR regarding info, and seemingly too much toleration for it- so much so, that I think it&#039;s a joke sellers request real information.<br /><br />

				There is a setting on facebook to choose who can see you in a search. I had mine set to &quot;no one&quot; at one time and nobody could fnd me when they did a search.<br />Later I changed it so only &quot;friends of friends&quot; could see it. <br />I think there is also settings to not show at all in searches and if you do want to appear in searches, u can choose what will be actually shown. So you could make only your name show in a search or name &amp; hometown, friends or whatever u choose.<br /><br />
