				You seem to be a pretty established member here and you havent learned PGP yet? Its something all newbs are encouraged to even do :O <br />Anyway mate , Type in club PGP on your search, Pine started the thread. Im sure it will be of use to you. Hundreds of people have learned there. <br />It&#039;s really very basic once you get it. <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />..HeatFireFlame..

				&nbsp; Hi, Kalli, its really easy once you get the hang of it, it may seem hard, do this command do that command, but trust me when I tell you its much more easier then you think. First of all, tell what you using Windows or Mac and I can teach basic PGP all in 10mins if it seems complicated in the other parts of the forum.<br /><br />Meerkovo

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure, no problem, just put in a pizza before the movie starts so got a minute :)<br /><br />1. Download gpg4win here - clear net gpg4win.org download the full installer and run it. <br /><br />2. When installing you can check them all no problem, or just Kleopatra if you want, Ive done all on my laptop. Look at every click you want, but its next, next, next on all of them. <br /><br />3. Try with the easy one first, open GPA and you will see a window &gt;&nbsp; &#039;Generate a key&#039; -&gt; pick a name &gt; bullshit email address &gt; backup copy yes/no &gt; create password &gt; save key somewhere &gt; close. It almost always crashes, but dont worry its all good. <br /><br />Do this steps and tell me when you done, we&#039;ll go through the next one. <br /><br /><br />Meerkovo<br /><br />

It automates your anonymity and leaves no room for failure and comes with a super easy to use version of PGP pre-installed.<br /><br />If you need a windows tutorial regardless i&#039;d recommend checking out GPG4win, to be honest you probably won&#039;t need a tutorial and could get away with just exploring the program and figuring out how it works.<br /><br />If all else fails you could read the documentation PDF they host at their website to learn how, to be honest I would post a tutorial for you but I couldn&#039;t find a good one on startpage, presumably because it&#039;s a self-explanatory program.<br />
