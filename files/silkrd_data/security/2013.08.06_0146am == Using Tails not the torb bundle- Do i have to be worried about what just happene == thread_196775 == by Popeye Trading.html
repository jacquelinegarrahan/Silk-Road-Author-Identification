				Hey Guys,<br /><br />A few months ago i stopped using the tor bundle and started using tails...<br /><br />On sat/sun i tried to check tormail a few times when it was down, i was just wondering if i need to be worried about the jave script?<br /><br />Any info on tails and the situation would be great,<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />PT

				Since Tails is a Linux distribution and the JavaScript exploit was specific to Windows (it worked by making calls to the Windows API), you are safe. Even if it worked on Linux, Tails *may* have prevented it with its transparent proxying, unless the exploit also rooted your Tails instance, which would be considerably harder than what it was designed to do. Everyone who recently switched to Tails was safe, which turned out to be a great move in this community, considering how many people used Tormail.<br />

				Tails would&#039;ve definitely given up a fake mac, a fake host name, and the Tor exit node address.. so nothing.<br />This is all detailed in their design document.<br /><br />@vlad902 on twitter suggesting TBB should be a VM instead of attached to Firefox. FF 0day isn&#039;t expensive LE can just phone up VUPEN or thegrugq and buy them on the cheap. Of course then they would just find 0day for the Virtual machine image, and probably activate wifi to geolocate targets. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Liberte Linux randomizes wireless MAC addresses at boot time and allows changing ethernet MAC addresses after boot is what I&#039;m thinking of. Tails shows completed/confirmed in their macchanger update but that was 19 days ago, and latest version was June 26 so I guess not included until next release. Tails is becoming such a gigantic project crammed full of addons they are just going to shapeshift into Windows one day and not even realize it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well, like I said, if it rooted Tails you wouldn&#039;t be safe, since then it could bypass Tor. Whonix is safer in that regard.<br />
