				Finally I have reached my fifty posts after months of lurking.&nbsp; I am in need of a step by step tutorial (FOR DUMMIES) on using DBAN to wipe hard drive on Windows 8 computer, Installing Liberte (preferably) or Tails on a flash drive and how to boot it on a computer that uses Windows 8, and finally how to setup and use a VPN.<br /><br />I will post a .33 BTC bounty on each topic.&nbsp; The tutorial must be VERY simplified but complete.&nbsp; If one person posts a comprehensive tutorial and posts it here in the security forum ( I know there are other tutorials, but I&#039;m wanting a total step by step to computer security and I believe it encompasses these three things if using a previously unsecured computer) I will add a bonus of .2 BTC to bring the total to 1.2BTC.&nbsp; Thank you for anyone who can provide this help.

				If you have a Windows machine:<br /><br />Download the DBAN iso image.&nbsp; This is a file that when you burn it to a disc in a specific way, it un packages the file and will allow you to boot from it.<br />Link [CLEARNET] http://www.dban.org/download<br />Burn the image file to disc using ImgBurn [Image to Disc function] or the built in windows burning software.<br /><br />Download TAILS from [CLEARNET] https://tails.boum.org/download/<br />There are quite simple instructions on that page<br />Burn the image file to disc using ImgBurn or the built in windows burning software<br /><br />Boot your PC with the DBAN disc in the CD drive<br />Follow the instructions and wipe the drive<br /><br />Once complete, boot the PC with the TAILS disc in the drive<br /><br />Insert a USB storage device<br />There is a menu function within TAILS after it boots to install TAILS to a USB storage device<br />This will install TAILS onto the USB storage device you have<br />If you wish, set up persistent storage on the rest of the USB storage device (menu option under the install tails to usb function)<br /><br />Sorry it is a bit rushed but hope this helps

				I was hoping for a really dumbed down tutorial that a 12 yr old could follow.&nbsp; I am offering the bounty so it can be compiled and hopefully stickied for all to see and use.

				No worries&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It honestly is quite simple to do, there aren&#039;t too many options that you can mess up with, especially if you are just using the defaults.<br /><br />If I get some time later I will try to write a detailed one out for you.<br /><br />Cheers

				Michael Westen would not have to offer a bounty to learn anything, he would be the one teaching us how it&#039;s done because Mike has it all figured out from experience. He was a international spy working on various covert missions for the CIA for years until they Burnt his ass. <br />&nbsp;
