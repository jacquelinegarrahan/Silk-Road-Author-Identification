				i&#039;ve been on sites like mtgox and mrbitcoin.com, but was wondering... do people just buy them from each other? it seems like if you have some left over and don&#039;t want them just hanging around to incriminate you it would make sense to sell it around the going rate.&nbsp; i could pay you over paypal. i don&#039;t know if i missed that and it&#039;s totally against the rules but i thought i&#039;d give it a shot. (sorry if this is on the wrong forum).&nbsp; message me over here if you have any to offer.<br /><br />

All Bitcoin Traders on SR have to have a vendor account - I offer a service for people in the UK/Europe selling coins to people for cash in the mail and other vendors based in the US such as CoinBox and BlueSkyTraders do the same in exchange for cash or MoneyPaks.<br /><br />It&#039;s doubtful you&#039;ll find a vendor willing to accept Paypal for two main reasons. Firstly although Bitcoin transactions can&#039;t be reversed, Paypal purchases can meaning a fradulent buyer could scam a vendor out of their Bitcoins.<br /><br />Secondly, like using an exchange, this would create a paper trail which would mean it would be possible to prove you&#039;d bought Bitcoins. A more detailed analysis of the block chain could even link them to a specific transaction although this is much more difficult.<br /><br />This explains the popularity of Bitcoin Traders over exchanges - there&#039;s one exchange based here in the UK called Intersango which has upset a lot of people as they&#039;ve received a large amount of bank transfers but have been hanging on to people&#039;s money - it seems their bank account has been frozen!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

All of those ways are virtually anonymous, as long as you send the bitcoins through a tumbler if you get them from bitinstant or bitmarket.eu.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not from the U.S. I would recommend working with Sugar Mama or BTCPal to get some BTCs. They&#039;re both generally the best vendors to work with and have quick turnaround times. Usually happens within 2 hours, the longest I&#039;ve had to wait is 12 hours.
