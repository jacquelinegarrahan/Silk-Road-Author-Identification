However that&#039;s what cash laundering involves. In terms of legitimizing illicit bitcoin-income you would need a bitcoin-business. And you can count on 1 hand the number of bitcoin-businesses that legitimately make 10k USD a month. Better off smurfing small amounts through localbitcoins.com in a dozen areas. At least until the BTC economy expands a few fold.

				Look for things that are easy to buy with bitcoin that are easy to translate back to cash, if that&#039;s what you want.&nbsp; I would take a look at precious metals and bullion. I&#039;ve seen adds on various bitcoin related websites for coinabul.com, which sells precious medals and coins. I did a little bit of math, and found that the difference between their bitcoin prices and $ prices at other sites is just over 3% on the 1oz American gold eagle (most popular gold coin) which is pretty good I&#039;d say. There is a section on SR for bullion, which would give you more security and keep your payment in escrow, but the markup is much higher. The coins should be able to be sold very easily for cash, or kept as a separate investment that will increase in value as the dollar decreases in value.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m not associated with that website, and I have no idea if they&#039;re legit. Seems legit imo. I am a big fan of owning some gold though. #1 rule of investing is to diversify. Also, gold as an investment or storage of wealth is very difficult for powers that be to track and tax, unlike any sort of bank investment.

				I would think the best way is to use several different methods rather than a single method.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are going to run into AML limits with various methods, which will be $500 a week in he US, unless you provide identity documents as required by US AML laws.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using a service BitMe (bitme.com) to buy my coin, and they let you move $500 a week per unverified account which requires only an email address for each account.&nbsp; &nbsp;For someone moving bitcoin to cash, they allow you to withdraw cash via ACH to a temporarily linked bank account or AurumXchange vouchers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now, they&#039;ve got more coin buyers than sellers, so you can get a pretty good rate going to USD.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you&#039;ve got a few friends that would let you move $500 a week through their bank accounts, this might be an option.&nbsp; AurumXchange has debit cards that can fund via their service, but I don&#039;t have any personal experience with them.

				As a SR vendor, I have struggled with this issue many times in the past. I used to use Mt Gox to international wire and then got worried when I started realizing how stupid that was. Then I tried bitcoin-otc to find very low liquidity and problems with finding legitimate people that would send cash. And I recently found Bitcopia.com. It&#039;s awesome. This dude mails you cash overnight and the fee is not even that much. Only problem is he only does max of $999 a day, but I just put in a new order every couple days. <br /><br />Bitcopia is the shit. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
