				Hi all,<br /><br />Am a N00b to SR and I have another question about using PGP encryption of messages sent via Silk Road&#039;s messaging system as opposed to just typing them in plain-text and relying on Silk Road&#039;s encryption. I&#039;ve searched previous topics but haven&#039;t found an answer / clarification yet... <br /><br />So when PGPing, I construct the message to be encrypted on my own computer (eg question to seller, or shipping address info etc), PGP encrypt it with the recipients public key, cut+paste the resulting encrypted text block from my computer into the SR message system and hit send.<br /><br />The recipient then copies the encrypted text block from their Inbox on Silk Road to their computer, decrypts it with their PGP program and private key and then has access to read the message i send them.<br /><br />This means that even though no plain-text version of the message is sent via SR message system, the unencrypted plain text message is potentially now stored in two places: on both the buyers and sellers computers. Even deleting those files doesn&#039;t guarantee removal of the information from their storage device (which could later be undeleted)...<br /><br />Why is this considered more secure than just sending the message via SR in plaintext, where it is stores in just one place and relying on SR&#039;s encryption and automatic deletion of shipping address info when a transaction is completed?<br /><br />thanks,<br />Z

				I am far from being an expert, but I&#039;ll try to answer this.<br />You are correct in how the PGP message system works. Using PGP encryption just adds an extra layer of security to the whole process. As far as I know the plaintext is not stored on either computer, unless the user chooses to save it as such. Even in that case, that file can be deleted in such a way as to guarantee the removal of any practical chance at &quot;undeletion&quot;.

				@AnotherPlebe yep i agree that secure file deletion is possible, but i think it usually requires the user to know to perform it - its not automatic.&nbsp; SR&#039;s message system (or at least the part buyers type their shipping info into) is deleted by default (if i understand the buyers guide correctly)...
