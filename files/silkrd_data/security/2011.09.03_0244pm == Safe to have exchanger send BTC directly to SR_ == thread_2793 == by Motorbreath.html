				Like my subject says, is this safe? Are there any complications? I&#039;m using a GreenDot MoneyPak if that makes any difference. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s safe but I&#039;d like to be sure.

				Never send BTC directly to SR from any location that might have your true identity or may have logged a real IP address when you did the transaction.<br /><br />At a minimum, you need to run your own wallet on your own machine (run the wallet over TOR).&nbsp; Transfer from your exchanger to your wallet, then to SR.

				Thanks for the advice. It&#039;s very much appreciated. However, what if I accessed the website via TOR and used a fake name, alternate email address created with TOR, etc.? Would that be okay, or is it better to have a wallet?<br /><br />If I can&#039;t transfer directly from exchanger to SR, can I use exchanger to something like InstaWallet over TOR? If so, what&#039;s the preferred wallet?

Bitcoins are traceable, so you need to show that they were sent to another address that is presumably not yours. <br /><br />Since Bitcoins can certainly be spent on lawful products, that payment could be for something like a donation to a charitable cause.
