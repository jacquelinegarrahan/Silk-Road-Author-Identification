				So I leave for vacation with about $1400 in my BTC account and come back to about $850ish now. wtf happend? What caused the crash does anyone know? Should I cash out now and walk away with what I have left or do you think it will go back up? Im not really that upset i was kind of learning how it all worked and playing like the stock market so should I just sit and wait or do we see this as a dead deal? I also took a hit in my SR account. Luckly its down now so I dont have to look what I lost in there lol. <br /><br />Lastly I heard there is a BTC tumbler in Bitcoin floor. does anyone know if that is true and if so how do I access it?<br /><br />Thank you

				no idea about the tumbler but in regards to the price it might take a while but gotta expect mega crashes.. those lads at bitcoin talk were thinking $1000 by the end of the year lets hope crashes like that aren&#039;t so drastic as the last if it gets that high. this time it was just a greed fest and fast as fuck panic sell

I separate out normal bitcoin users like us, and bitcoin &#039;supporter&#039; weirdos like those on bitcointalks. <br /><br />Something that is supposed to be a currency doesn&#039;t need supporters, just people that use it. Anyway, with all the pricing chaos, it is clear that there is a need for a stable transactional token in the future.

Besides never spending more than you can afford to lose is there any golden rules you should follow or is this like the stock market, there will be ups and downs? Thanks for your input. Im pretty new to all this BTC but im enjoying messing with it for a hobby.
