				I have been trying to buy BTC because of the great rate right now. I have been using BITINSTANT but MT GOX is down. Do I have any other options that I can use cash deposit for? I went to BITSTAMP but they require a wire transfer that takes up to 5 days, which is no good for me.

				www.okpay.com<br />Fund your account with &quot;Bank Transfer&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; International Wire costs $45 dollars whether you send 10 dollars or 1000 dollars.<br />Best to send the most money you can. (Bitinstant would have costed about 50 dollars to send a thousand)<br />Send your funds to www.btc-e.com and buy bitcoins lower than Mt.Gox Value<br />Send the coins Over to Mt.Gox and sell them for higher than you paid for them (you need to wait till Mt.Gox to be about $15 higher for this to work)<br />Sell them.<br />Send the money back to OKPAY (you must be verified for this)

				i was really lucky, and i remembered that I had a zip zap payment slip from yesterday when I accidently put down 100 dollars LESS then I needed. So today, I looked at my email to get the numbers, and it was EXACTLY how much I needed :) (The cost of my item + a $20 Buffer for fees and bitcoin changed) <br /><br />Its going through the tumbler as we speak ;) <br /><br />So as I did, see if you have any unused payment slips in your email, remember they go out of use after 120 hours i believe? But for some reason I think 3 days sounds more like it.. Try it out!<br /><br />-Lster
