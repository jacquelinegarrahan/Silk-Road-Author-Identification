				So, I think it&#039;s likely that LE could have a seller account. I think some tend to underestimate the law enforcement and agencies a bit here on SR but i think it would be more ridiculous to say that LE isn&#039;t disguised as a seller account. Before you read further, my opinion may be bias due to the blow i been doing.<br /><br />I mean think about it, maybe it would be impractical for small sales, but for people who buy larger quantities... DEA would have no problem finding people.. they would have your mailing address.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to discuss here is, we should be weary of sellers too. Even the top rated sellers can&#039;t necessarily be trusted. The very number 1 rated seller could be an undercover DEA agent just adding up name after name of people buying large quantities.. The shitty part is, is that there really is no way of knowing who to trust here. Cuz shit, a well-rated seller here could get arrested and would more than likely become a snitch to save his own ass from going to prison and just give out the street addresses of all the people who have bought from.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to lie but I often wonder, what if my main dealer on SR is just a LE just gathering info about me and just waiting for funding from the state to knock down my doors and prosecute my ass. I don&#039;t want to go to the clink.

				Unless you&#039;re buying more than personal use at the time, LE aren&#039;t going to waste their time on you.&nbsp; The DEA is focused on the distribution channels, not consumers.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t going to pursue you unless it&#039;s clear that there&#039;s intent to sell.<br /><br />Local cops don&#039;t have the resources or the knowledge to do this either - after all, what&#039;s the likelihood that a potential buyer falls within their jurisdiction?<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty safe for buyers if you are buying in quantities that are clearly for personal use.<br /><br />But this is my only post, so who know if you can trust a word I&#039;m saying!

Personally if I picked up a sheet it&#039;d have absolutely nothing to do with selling it, just a head stash. Specially with how weak the acid going around here is, a good trip takes 5-10 hits, so a half sheet is gone before you know it.<br /><br />Back in my younger years a buddy of mine got count with an ounce of weed and was charged with possession with intent to sell. His lawyer got him &#039;off&#039; from the max sentence of 10 years to 2 months and community service.<br /><br />I think it really depends if your lucky or not if the DEA/Customs/LE find it, what kind of mood are they in, how long has it been since they got someone, are they on some sort of roll or do they have bigger fish to fry.

				Please, I wish people would not cause so much speculation without any sort of proof... if you want to discuss the possibility create a thread in off topic or security. but for you to use a title that suggests you actually have evidence or there is a confirmed LEO is not warranted imo. there is one of these threads like every week where people just want to cry wolf and promote a bunch of fear mongering speculation. you should assume there are LEO on the site obviously, which is a danger with using an unestablished vendor. <br /><br />Also, LEO can do whatever the fuck they want, which includes training warlords in the school of the americas to distributing weapons or some measly drugs...<br /><br />Did no one else hear about the recent stories involving a US governmental agency, ATF I believe, which released a bunch of illegal weapons, like automatic assault rifles, onto the (street) black market??? The intention was to track the weapons into the hands of the drug cartels, and then bust them that way...<br /><br />But as usual all their plans got fucked and for some reason releasing more lethal armory onto the streets ended up being a bad idea, go figure. They subsequently lost track of many of these guns and now they are still being used by the cartels to kill police officers (and of course innocent lives too). Oh the irony. It would be funny if it wasnt so depressing.<br /><br />And you are debating whether LEO can release some drugs onto the streets because it could possibly kill somebody.

				Look. If LEO&#039;s selling some good shit, I&#039;m buying. What&#039;s his Silk Road URL? I know they didn&#039;t go stealth. :P<br /><br />Seriously though... LEO is probably the scammers. A LEO tactic to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt in the community. They would take advantage of the system&#039;s weakness. They&#039;re scam buyers and scam sellers. Look at the policies that had to be enacted because of scammers. Makes it harder for new buyers to buy and makes it harder for established sellers to sell to new buyers. This has the effect of concentrating buyer/seller groups. And everyone in those mall groups trust on another. So all LEO has to do a have an account with one of these trusted selllers and they can be keen on looking for stupid mistakes. <br /><br />Diversification is one of the keys to avoid LEO&#039;s traps.

This has the effect of concentrating buyer/seller groups. And everyone in those mall groups trust on another.

				While understandable, I find threads like these funny.&nbsp; Most trial transcripts are part of the public domain, read them... and add a dash of critical thinking....&nbsp; you&#039;ll soon realize that &quot;LEO&quot; is not pursuing the recreational users.&nbsp; Parenthetically, I&#039;m certain they are involved here, but not at risk to the/a buyer. <br /><br />How do the douche-bags say it.....?&nbsp; SWIM was in court the other day, and during cross-examination of Detective Vargas of the XXX county PD, he fucked up by .... (excerpt):<br /><br />&quot;Q. Does the Task Force look the same today as it did when you started 21 years ago? <br />A. No.<br />Q. In what ways has it changed?<br />A. When I started 21 years ago, I was actually assigned to the XXX County Sheriff&#039;s Office Narcotics Unit. XXX PD had their own Narcotics Unit. Around 2000, we merged together. There already was a Task Force, which was based in the City of XXX. Around 2000, we merged into one unit, so there is only one Task Force that has all the agencies put together in there.&quot;<br /><br />....<br /><br />[Discussion about two types of informants and their motivations - omitted]<br /><br />&quot;Q. Now, you mentioned the term &quot;controlled buy.&quot; What do you mean by that?<br />A. A controlled buy is when we have an informant that has given us a location where<br />he or she can buy drugs. What we do first is meet that informant, we get the information, we try to do a little bit of homework on it to see if it is reliable or not or if they are telling the truth. What we will do is have the informant contact the supplier, make arrangement to purchase a certain amount of drugs. Prior to sending that person to the drug dealer, we will search that person&#039;s car and his or her person. If they are not driving, we just search the person. We will search them and the vehicle to make sure they are not carrying drugs into a suspected dealer&#039;s house so they have no drugs on them and no money so they can&#039;t buy stuff themselves. If they do have money, we take it and hold onto it until it is done. After that, then, we will follow them to the house, make sure that we keep on that person, that they go nowhere else, that they meet nobody else. .....<br /><br />Q. One last question on this topic before we move on to some stuff more directly related to this particular investigation. Is it often the case that you as detectives give informants the targets? In other words, say, hey, I&#039;ve got a tip that Joe is out dealing a lot of cocaine. Can you go see if you can get into Joe? Or does it most often work in the reverse where the informants are bringing you a potential target?<br />A. We don&#039;t give informants targets to go out and track down for us. They are the ones that usually give us the information, a name and location. There have been times where like we receive a complaint of an establishment that is selling drugs in the parking lot or inside the bar. We might sent an informant in a car to see what&#039;s going on, but we don&#039;t give them names and targets. We just send them in to check things out. But as far as names, we don&#039;t give them names.&quot;<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m a bit drunk and tired, and so, I don&#039;t want to explain - or, ask SWIM to explain to me. (ha-ha).&nbsp; But SWIM did win his 3.6 motion, and Vargs&#039;s testimony was impeached.... This, however, is from a couple of weeks ago - understand what is and is not permissible for LEO... very limited.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paranoia is good but too much can be crippling. Not to get political, but it&#039;s your body and mind not the governments - and so, you are the master of your domain, not what some legislative or judicial body determines.&nbsp; <br /><br />As Rage Against The Machine said quoting NWA - &quot;FUCK THE POLICE.... Comin straight from the underground. Young nigga got it bad cuz I&#039;m brown, And not the other color so police think, They have the authority to kill a minority....Fuck that shit, cuz I ain&#039;t tha one.&quot;&nbsp;

				No offense OP, but you also totally miss the fact that SR, by it&#039;s very systemic nature, makes it difficult to PROVE that, not only did you actually make the specific purchase, but that it was your INTENT to do so. If you shut up and keep your ego in check you can always stay safe in the realms of your mind.<br /><br />Be smart and control your online and mobile footprint at all times. The internet, whether this be good or bad, affords you the ability to control your identity...use it to protect yourself and use the available resources to navigate through the scammers.<br /><br />For us Americans we have especially strong civil liberties, whether or not they&#039;ve weakened in the last decades. We have a right to counsel and not to speak; this simple fact is so undervalued when it really is that important.<br /><br />Above all, Karma is fucking real...always keep yourself grounded.

				I know opinions are like assholes but......<br /><br />LE does conduct reverse &quot;buy/busts&quot;, they are typically done in the same fashion as they do to bust those trolling for street hookers.&nbsp; They do these for the same reason they crack down on &quot;johns&quot;, to shame the buyers and as public relations to send a message to would be buyers/johns that hey you might get busted.<br /><br />That said; if a LEO did pose as a seller on SR and busted a buyer we would hear about it, they would make a big public deal out of it because the purpose would be to intimidate and scare potential SR customers.&nbsp; Now we could argue the effectiveness of this tactic but that is neither here or there.

				The only police agencies that let drugs back onto the market are big city narcotics units. It&#039;s not like the feds gave away automatic rifles to drug cartels or anything lol.<br /><br />But seriously, I doubt LE will be selling hard drugs as vendors on here especially after the whole Fast &amp; Furious debacle. I do see them busting a few low-hanging vendors and then flipping them to informants while allowing them to continue their business. LE builds a case against all the buyers, then swoops in and makes an example of them. How many buyers would still trust SR after that, especially if the cops are smart and go after something small like weed to make the full spectrum of buyers piss themselves in fear?<br /><br />The best thing about SR is the difficulty involved in prosecuting users who know what they&#039;re doing. Someone else already mentioned this, but it&#039;s very, very hard to actually prove intent and even possession if the buyer covers his tracks, doesn&#039;t fall for controlled deliveries, and knows not to talk to cops. However, that won&#039;t help if the feds want to round up a bunch of buyers and just throw charges at them hoping a few stick. The feds don&#039;t like to tarnish that conviction rate of theirs but I can definitely see them arresting dozens of buyers only to have charges dropped, so as long as it panics the SR community and severely disrupts business.<br /><br />My advice is don&#039;t be the low hanging fruit. There&#039;s always a chance you&#039;ll be caught either way, but IMO it&#039;s still safer to buy off SR (if you do it right) than to buy off the street, even if you&#039;re dealing with friends. &quot;Randomly&quot; receiving a package with drugs offers more deniability than a hand off in the street or buying from a CI you know personally.

				The problem I see with LE vending legitimate drugs is the lack of control.<br /><br />1) You could get your drugs without incident.&nbsp; Without someone being there to officially document you taking delivery, there isn&#039;t much evidence once the drugs are gone and consumed.<br /><br />2) You could get your drugs via controlled delivery.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve taken every other precaution, shut your fucking mouth and get an attorney.&nbsp; You should be fine.<br /><br />3) You never receive your package of pure Afghani #4 because your neighbor&#039;s teenage son or daughter get it instead, overdose, and die.&nbsp; That&#039;s going to over real well during the resultant investigation.<br /><br />When cops sell drugs, guns, or anything else, those products are tightly watched/monitored.controlled.&nbsp; This element of control is lost when packages are mailed received without controlled delivery.&nbsp; Look how much shit the Eric Holder and the DoJ are getting over walking guns to Mexico...<br /><br />Much more likely is that LE will purchase drugs, gather intel, file disputes, and cause chaos.

				You would have to be a little naive to think that LEO would never try and open a vendor account.&nbsp; I don&#039;t give a shit if it&#039;s federal, state, or local.&nbsp; I would never put it past any level of US law enforcement to create a vendor account.&nbsp; They have used reversed stings for years after busting weed/crack holes, or even to bust potential &quot;johns&quot; in prostitution stings.&nbsp; They don&#039;t let you get to far after you buy it though, so you would know right away once you were duped by LEO in a reverse sting.<br /><br />You also have to account for scammers like ObamaGirl potentially being LEO.&nbsp; This would be an easy way to get addresses and just to piss people off.

				As you say there&#039;s no way to be certain.<br /><br />I work as a Paralegal though and I have to tell you this would be considered textbook entrapment. The very nature of SR means that a Law Enforcement Agent would be placing themselves in an extremely compromising position by having an account on here in the first place, even in the name of ostensibly policing the internet for illegal activity.<br /><br />If we ignore the first issue and assume your District Attorney&#039;s office in America, or my Crown Prosecution Service in England would overlook the issue of entrapment, there is also the issue of the burden of proof.<br /><br />It is indeed a crime to attempt to buy drugs but how would the Prosecution go about proving a connection between you and an attempted buyer? There is no IP address to link to you to the account you created through SR, nor the e-mail address with which it is associated. Bitcoin transactions are difficult enough to trace at the best of times and as memory serves SR uses a mixer to obfuscate the transaction history further.<br /><br />Even if a clear transfer of funds could be established from a particular buyer account and yours, this is a far cry from the burden of evidence necessary to lay out before a jury - in reality all they would have is your address, which could have been written by anyone with access to a phone book.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Police monitor SR when possible but setting themselves up as established vendors would get them nowhere.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15465.msg169315#msg169315">Quote from: Dirtyduke on March 30, 2012, 04:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s not paranoia, it&#039;s simple fact that LE has used selling drugs as a way to bust users, not just sellers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another fact is that some of the people that are buying stuff on SR are buying large enough amounts to be reselling whatever it is they are buying on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />At the end of the day, they can do whatever the hell they want.&nbsp; It may not hold up in court, but no one here wants to sit through the stress of a trial.&nbsp; It would only take a few busts of some of the more frequent buyers on here to start a shit load of real paranoia.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				In direct answer to the OP, I think you may have hit the blow a bit too hard pal. Like the people above said the Bacon solicits to buy to get warrants to arrest those that sell. You may get some bent Bacon selling bits out of an evidence lock up but that&#039;s about it. If there was Bacon on here they would be soliciting to build cases against sellers that are the big fish rather than the buyers who are the tiddlers. You gotta cut the head off a snake and watch the body die yano. <br /><br />

				I have thought about this and agree with what most people say in regards to LE only going for the sellers. Apart from getting detailed information from exchanges which itself would be a huge undertaking. Isn&#039;t it possible they could order from sellers and check for DNA, a hair or a fingerprint on the inner packaging could easily lead to someone on the criminal database (if they are on there that is).

				Perhaps LE would pose as vendors to farm addresses.. But then again they&#039;d have to sell drugs to do that. I know that isn&#039;t beyond them, but it doesn&#039;t seem up to scale to do something that serious to bust people buying personal amounts.<br /><br />I think whats far more likely is that they&#039;re profiling vendors based on forum posts/time of logins/amount of sales/postmarks ETC or pursuing some sort of fault in Tor to locate the main SR servers.

For entrapment to work LE would need to offer you drugs, you turn them down and then they continually pressure you into buying them. If they offer drugs and you place an order it is not entrapment. In parts of Europe the law is different but in USA reverse stings are common place.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Right, I agree that would not be entrapment. I&#039;m not saying LE won&#039;t sell drugs, they do it all the time, but they need approval for controlled sales. Having an undercover under surveillance doing a controlled sale or selling/purchasing from a suspects home in order to get a warrant is one thing, and happens often. Mailing drugs around would be completely uncontrolled, and I just can&#039;t see this being an approved way for them to pursue or convict anyone.<br /><br />So let&#039;s say for a minute an LE agency did decide to go undercover as a vendor here. If they come right out trying to sell bulk only, no one is going to buy shit. If they start small then they have to legitimately sell small amounts of drugs to buyers since they aren&#039;t going to waste the manpower to bust small buyers, and if they did then they would never get any feedback that they would need before they could even start selling bulk to people they would actually want to bust.<br /><br />I just think there are hundreds of more likely and legitimate threats than an LE agency being an undercover vendor. An undercover buyer is much more likely and as I said the tools are there for vendors to protect themselves from such a threat by remaining completely anonymous at all costs. Of all face to face sellers in the country, LE still can&#039;t control it and they convict them left and right but most of them are caught by someone snitching, which gives places like SR a huge advantage where a vendors buyers don&#039;t even know who they are, or where they are if they spread their drops out well enough.

				I have no idea if it is happening or not, but to think the government wouldn&#039;t sell drugs is ridiculous.&nbsp; It is well documented that the DEA imported cocaine to the West Coast for years to support the contras.&nbsp; Well documented...did the cocaine kill people?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure....
