				Hi,<br /><br />Hope someone can help..<br /><br />I tried to transfer some money into my MtGox account yesterday in the normal way, bank transfer (UK), to their account details like I have done for months.&nbsp; Only then after, I realised they have made changes to their funding options...<br />The money has left my bank account, is this money now lost?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve sent mt gox an email but they haven&#039;t got back to met yet, just wondering if anyone know of if anyone has been or is in the same boat?<br /><br />Thanks and sorry if this has been asked already!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Suda

				Try contacting your bank, too. Not sure what to say to them really... but worth a shot. Let them know the company you typically pay changed their banking information and you just realized it.<br />.Hades.

				The money should just bounce.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can buy lots of stuff with BTC these days.

				Hey SudaPuda,<br />Good to hear the money bounced back. :)<br />Also, as Sunray1000 posted, there are several legitimate uses for bitcoin at this point. There is actually a 5* hotel and several restaurants in our area that take them. <br />.Hades.
