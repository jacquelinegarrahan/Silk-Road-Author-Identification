				When you cut and paste does that info. get stored somewhere. Is there anyway I can&#039;t delete the history of that forever? Does it get saved somewhere on my laptop. Thanks for any informed responses!

				Technically yes. When you copy something, it&#039;s stored in RAM. RAM is cleared when you computer shuts off, but it&#039;s possible to retrieve data. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence#Data_in_RAM

				Is truecrypt even necessary? <br />If I have no SR related bookmarks on my Tor broswer, no SR account/ewallet information stored in any files on my computer, and I have my usernames/passwords/SR URL memorized and not physically written down anywhere, there is no incriminating evidence on my computer, therefore I have no need for truecrypt, correct?

				FYI using truecrypt and not handing over your truecrypt password is punishable in the UK, unless you go to further measures to have two different keys to decrypt your hard drive in two different manners - one completely legit, one less so legit.<br /><br />Seriously though you don&#039;t need to use truecrypt, just use TAILS. it&#039;s an operating system made by the makers of Tor, it runs on USB which only stores data by RAM which gets wiped once it&#039;s shut down.

				Thank you for your responses. Anyone have a link to walk me through tails? I don&#039;t know how I would&#039;ve figured out PGP without these forums. Thank you everyone. I need to clean this laptop up, too paranoid to let it go.

				I&#039;d suggest running a virtual machine (VMWare Player) and once you&#039;ve installed the OS on the VM workstation you created truecrypt that partition.&nbsp; <br /><br />That way you can do everything you&#039;d normally do in your normal OS and do your &#039;secret&#039; things in your virtual machine, whose contents are stored on your primary partition and truecrypted.

				Thanks Pharma. I&#039;ve been trying all kind of things like ubuntu and it&#039;s not clicking for me unfortunately. I would just like to delete the content on my clipboard. I don&#039;t see why it doesn&#039;t disappear when I shut my computer down.

				Hi<br />If anyone&#039;s willing, I could really use some help. I&#039;m running tails now but I just can&#039;t figure how to decrypt pgp messages. Anyone able to give advice or a good link? Thanks!

				in tails go to<br />applications -&gt; accessories -&gt;gedit<br /><br />paste the pgp message<br /><br />select all (ctrl+a)<br /><br />edit-&gt;decrypt<br /><br /><br />also, you can import pgp keys the same way, rather than bothering with saving the pgpkey to a file

				Thank you tootie,<br /><br />I can import public keys that way but I cannot decrypt. When I shut down it seems my key pair gets wiped out. So I can&#039;t decrypt. Thanks for your help.
