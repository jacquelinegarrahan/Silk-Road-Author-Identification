				Hey people, I just posted bail(over 40k). I was in jail for a few days. I dont want to release too much info,but I need your help. They knocked on my door with a arrest warrent for me. They got my computer but didnt get my smartphone. I dont have anything saved on the pc, nothing is bookmarked. I got everything memorized. The only thing on it is torbrowserbundle.exe.&nbsp; I manually run the zipped file then open the folder and run tor. After im done, I delete the folder from recycle bin. Think they will find much?<br /><br />Some of the charges include distribution, manufacturing, and pissession. Over 7 charges filed against me! I have a seller account but they never even seized my usps and postal supplies. This makes me think that these charges are more from my IRL dealings and not silk road, but why did they take my tower? Also, they didnt take my tablet, android, or laptop. Isnt this odd? <br /><br />all that the warrent listed was my arrest and my livingroom computer tower. Its my main pc.&nbsp; This makes me think maybe a somebuddy told the cops I sell shit on that particular pc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cops got a half pound of ak, 50 rolls, 7 ounces of shrooms, 90ct roxy, 50 xanax, &amp; a few oxy 80s. They found a monotub of bplus too.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />I am not admitting guilt in this thread, rather I am simply discussing public record.

				In the United States? <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe they wouldn&#039;t take your cell phone and laptop if you were dealing in person. If none of your packages were seized and you switched up your shipping locations frequently enough, I&#039;m willing to bet someone local sold you out and fingered that computer specifically. Alternately, they could have been the worst police team of all time.<br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m so sorry to hear this shit. God bless man - I hope it turns out for the best for you!

				My family got me a good lawyer(over 50k). He says its pretty grim but since I have no priors, might be able to get me all paper and no time. He says worst case scenario, I will get less than 5 years. I took a few(legal) listings down, im done with drugs. Im wearing a fucking gps like a animal. I have never hurt anyone. This war on drugs(liberty) is bs. <br />Ps, I am in a legal state and have a card so the pot charge is not gonna be a problem, my worst problem is the monotub. They tried to say the pinning boomers were worth like ten grand street value. Fucking morons. It would have been like a qp dry, if that

				Yes, and when they weighed that monotub they probably weighed it, container, substrate, and all. They are fucking stupid/assholes like that. Good luck. I too would say someone ratted on you when they got busted because no way in hell they put on the warrant (computer in the living room) without some prior knowledge.

				Wow.<br /><br />This has freaked me out to the max. Im starting to wonder if this is worth it.<br /><br />TBO it almost seems easier to get busted doing SR than IRL, they dont have to find evidence the SR method.<br /><br />Order a package, Scope out the post offices in the zip it was mailed from, and bam. Doesn&#039;t take a genius.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Exotica

				Man, I&#039;m really really sorry to hear about that. Since they didn&#039;t take any postage or packaging, I do wonder if your IRL dealings were the problem here. It really does suck though dude. Why would anyone care about some guy selling fucking pills and mushrooms? As if that&#039;s the USA&#039;s biggest problem. Good luck man, I really hope you get a light sentence. If they ruin your life over this kind of bullshit, I would be so pissed, even more than I already am. Hopefully the war on drugs ends sooner rather than later. Innocent people are getting caught in the bullshit.

				This was definitely a raid linked to irl dealing and not SR. I know plenty of people that have been raided digital crimes and they go straight for the electronics, even tear your house apart to look for your hidden memory cards. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20613.msg209205#msg209205">Quote from: Exotica on April 26, 2012, 06:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20613.msg209143#msg209143">Quote from: ArmTrax on April 26, 2012, 06:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">It is almost impossible to get a warrant without a recorded deal.

Well eventually word got out of what he was doing and LE staked out his place and would harass/threaten his customers that would come out of a deal and eventually some of them cracked and were willing to testify against him, that&#039;s when the warrant was issued and they busted the door. <br /><br />I wish you the best of luck, hopefully your lawyer does some miracles cause I&#039;ve seen lawyers get dealers out of some heavy sentences. The only advice I can offer you at this point is to always be respectful, sound humble, and dress/groom appropriately.

				I think the bust is related to IRL dealings. May have sold to a CI or someone you know got busted and dropped a dime on you. Did they seize any other computer equipment such as printer, scanner or other stuff? or just PC. I think seizing you PC is standard procedure in a felony warrant. Also, allowing to leave your smartphone allows them to keep suviellance on you and who you call after the arrest. I would goto the arresting agency and get a full police report you&#039;ll get a better Idea whay they had a warrant on you the fist place. Might be a while before your lawyer gets the discovery. They&#039;ll probably scan your regular browsing history and email for any incriminating evidence or use it to bust other people that my be involved. Tor Browser is does&#039;nt really save any history. So I doubt they would do anything about that. I would have SR admin delete your SR account just to on the safe side.

				1. What are you accessing SRF on here exactly? An internet cafe I hope?<br />2. Yes, they may find Tor. But it&#039;s not enough. Be wary of follow up though.<br />3. Let the lawyer do the talking.<br />4. They are mostly busting your balls, I would be surprised if you get time on what you&#039;ve told us.<br />5. Particularly you are black, then take this seriously:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only advice I can offer you at this point is to always be respectful, sound humble, and dress/groom appropriately. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Using street slang, slouching, the way you address a judge or officer of the court, wearing the wrong clothes, that&#039;ll be a multiplier factor.

				Keep your head up! If you have no priors and have a good attorney, you&#039;ll stay out of jail.&nbsp; My ex-roommate was getting rolls Fed-Ex&#039;d by the hundreds, someone she sold to go pinched and rolled on her.&nbsp; She had a big fucking mouth and told people how she got her shit so they intercepted the package, dressed up undercover as the Fed Ex man she signed one morning like she had been for 10 months and the next thing you know, state,local, and federal agents raid our place.&nbsp; I was at work and they found a little bud in my room which she owned up to as hers but long story short she probably rolled on her dude I never asked but she never did time. This was like 10 years ago..

				Seems like every time I scope the SR forums there&#039;s a new post about a bust lately. I&#039;m thoroughly freaked out and I&#039;m probably the smallest time buyer on here. I feel for you man, but I hope this happened due to your IRL dealings. I also feel like IRL is safer than SR these days&nbsp; :-\ There must be a task force that&#039;s been established just for this, in spite of us trying to wrap our heads around the reasoning behind it.
