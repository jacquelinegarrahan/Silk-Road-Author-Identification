				for purchasing btc purposes, ive utilitzed bitcopia exclusively for quite few months and have no hiccups with transfers at bank, no id, and no wait time longer than 4 hrs to hit SR.&nbsp; last couple weeks seem to be rough for everyone as far as volatility is concerned.&nbsp; unfortunately, his have since gone under due to banking issues.&nbsp; &#039;re: his cleannet site (http://www.bitcopia.com/buy.php)for more info&#039;<br /><br />so question at hand, can anyone vouch for bluesky as is as simple to use and anonymity is concerned.&nbsp; ive only lurked there and they seem to be legit but lately always seem to be pre-selling for next days business...<br /><br />thanks for replies and direction.

				I have used BST on multiple occasions and can vouch for them being legit and professional. They are pretty much pre-order only ATM just because the demand is too high to keep up with. So def give them a try! <br /><br />Oh but they dont allow confirmations to tormail anymore since they have been having so many issues. Hope this helps&nbsp;

				Bitcopia and BlueSky are both, well were since Bitcopia is out of the game for now. Top Tier services. They operated the same, just using different banks, of course no info required of purchaser to make deposit.<br /><br />The biggest issue with BlueSky for most now is that they no longer allow the use of Tormail, but being that Tormail has been so dodgy lately, that&#039;s not a bad thing. Also BlueSky gets swamped so you need to plan ahead, no spur of the moment BTC purchases from them anymore.
