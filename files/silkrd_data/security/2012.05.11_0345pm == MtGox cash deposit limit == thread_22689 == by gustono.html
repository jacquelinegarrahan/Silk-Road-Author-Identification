				Just found out people in the UK can deposit via Barclays bank, and I have heard there being a limit on how much you can deposit by cash deposit before them asking for ID. <br /><br />Certainly wouldn&#039;t deposit more than 100pound at once, but seeing as I need a larger amount than 100 pounds it will be annoying to keep on depositing 50 pound increments, not to mention suspicous.

I sell Bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail to people in the UK (Please see link below for more info). I can change larger amounts of cash for you if needs be via a bank account I have set up.<br /><br />Barclays do have deposit points where you can leave cash but of course they could simply decline to deposit the cash above a certain amount and this is quite a gamble to take!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Vladmir I&#039;m quite frankly annoyed at your constant advertisement of btc for cash service, as subtle as it may be, whenever I try to get a proper answer or solution to my problems you come and wave your service in everyones face. <br /><br />Anyone other than vladmir have helpful discussion or thoughts on this?

If you are having difficulties depositing cash without showing ID however using an exchange service is one of the few options open to you - as far as I know I am the only one offering this service in the UK so at the moment(!) using a BTC exchanger in the UK amounts to the same thing - of course I welcome any healthy competition! <br /><br />Secondly, as you&#039;ll read from my 300+ posts (including those in this thread) I have gone out of my way to be as kind and welcoming to newcomers to Silk Road and have offered tips for amongst other things:<br /><br />- Full Disk Encryption<br />- Plausible Deniability (as it applies to encryption)<br />- Viable PGP software<br />- Money Laundering theory (if not actual methods)<br />- The basis of Public Key Cryptography.<br /><br />Hell, I even started a thread about using book ciphers to protect your passwords from which people didn&#039;t even stand to gain a penny.<br /><br />I really couldn&#039;t give a damn if you find it irritating or not - the only two surefire ways to obtain Bitcoin in complete safety is either to sell goods or buy BTC using cash. Any other method entails a risk of your transaction being traced - if you don&#039;t believe me why don&#039;t you look at the other dozen or so threads on this subject.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

I was treated very kindly when a newcomer to SR and have tried to extend that kindness to people who don&#039;t understand the nature of Bitcoin as fully, something about pearls before swine I fear...<br /><br />V.

				Apologies for not being able to answer your question, but how does one go about a direct cash&nbsp; deposit with Barclays? I am not with Barclays, and I assume I don&#039;t need to be.

They can be a bit slow at Barclays so make sure that you have them put the Ref # in or else your money won&#039;t be linked to your account.<br /><br />V.

The risk is that it&#039;s not quite as anonymous as cash in the mail as you&#039;ll still be caught on the bank&#039;s CCTV and you&#039;ll have to fill in the deposit slip in your own handwriting and sign it. If the OP is to be believed there may be ID required for larger amounts.<br /><br />I have been able to circumvent this problem for my business but I have the benefit of being in an offshore jurisdiction - any problems feel free to ask. Despite what others have to say on the subject I&#039;m more than happy to help someone who&#039;s decided to take their chances with the banks. :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
