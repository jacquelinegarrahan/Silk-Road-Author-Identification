				The last thing we need is someone telling LE how they go about cashing out of bits, it would just make it that much easier to try to bring SR down by making it harder for sellers to get their money out. I hope no one exposes something that is better left silent except for those who really need to know.

				Do you really think LE doesn&#039;t know how to cash out BTC, If they already did multi billion dollar laundering operations?<br /><br />C&#039;mon get real.

				Of course they know all the ways it is done but why tell them exactly how they do it here as that would just make it easier for them by trying to regulate it. It is better to leave them guessing which way is used most then it will be much harder to put in regulations that will slowly kill SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am sure LE knows about all tricks that can be used to run this site but since there are so many options out there it comes down to which ones does LE go after first and how long until they hit the right spot where it will really make a difference. <br /><br />The less talk there is around here about how things are run the harder it will be for them too get into SR and bring it down.

				That&#039;s true, we don&#039;t need to feed them. <br /><br />If somebody has a great method of exchanging BTC to psychical money i&#039;d be more than happy to reward you (if it works for me)<br /><br />- Amphetamine.

				I sell BTC in exchange for cash in the mail on SR. See link to my seller page below.<br /><br />Otherwise if you don&#039;t want to go through a bank account and have a large amount of money I&#039;d suggest using a site like Coinabul to buy precious metals. <br /><br />V.

				Im new to this and don&#039;t want any member naming specifics that could jeapardize the safety of those here on SR.<br />I&#039;m looking to buy Bitcoins for the first time. I went to MT. Gox site and am concerned about entering my real name/information.&nbsp; How can I remain completely anonymous if I&#039;m transfering money from an account? Is there any way I can purchase money orders/western union and send without my name attached? This would seem impossible.&nbsp;

				Vladimir,<br /><br />My post wasn&#039;t meant as an attack in any shape or form, i just misread it and thought you were advertising the opposite way, the error is on my side. Coinabul sounds like a great alternative, but i don&#039;t get what&#039;s so hard about storing some gold in a safe place?<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Unable to express myself correctly.

				Please accept my apologies, I&#039;d had a bad day at the office.<br /><br />There&#039;s no great issue with buying and storing gold and it&#039;s certainly more anonymous than a bank account. The disadvantage as far as I can of that versus cash in the mail is firstly one of liquidity - if you want to sell a gold bar you&#039;ll need to do it one go at spot prices. Also it&#039;ll be difficult to reinvest your profits in new ventures. <br /><br />Second if your property / safety deposit box was ever raided you&#039;d have a hell of a job explaining away the stack of gold bars! <br /><br />As I said, I live in the UK so am not out to make a fast buck from you but my advice would be to find a seller in the US who will translate your coins into cash in the mail as I think it&#039;s the safest option.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20165.msg209383#msg209383">Quote from: Amphetamine on April 26, 2012, 08:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Vladimir,<br /><br />My post wasn&#039;t meant as an attack in any shape or form, i just misread it and thought you were advertising the opposite way, the error is on my side.
