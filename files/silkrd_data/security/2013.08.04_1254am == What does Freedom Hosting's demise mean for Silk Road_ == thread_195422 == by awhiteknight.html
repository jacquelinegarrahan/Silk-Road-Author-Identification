				With the owner of Freedom Hosting arrested, what does that mean for The Silk Road? Do we now believe that the FBI have the ability to find the real addresses of Tor hidden services and is SR at risk?<br /><br />I hope we get a statement from DPR about the site&#039;s security, if done properly closing SR would be a whack-a-mole exercise with no funds risked.

				Hopefully they haven&#039;t found a way to take silkroad down.<br /><br />Act like it&#039;s comprimised anyway so it shouldn&#039;t matter.

				Anonymous easily broke into Freedomhosting to mess with the server, they did this numerous times so stands to reason that&#039;s all the FBI did. That or they also had informants because this guy was working with for-profit CP dealers (lowest forms of life) and they probably sold him out. Since they found his bank accounts, I&#039;m thinking what happened is the FBI privately contacted him, offered him a huge amount of money because that&#039;s all feds have, lot&#039;s of money, and then followed the money trail. He probably didn&#039;t accept bitcoins <br /><br />

				my only concern is that my PGP key is tied to Tormail, but I never used the Tormail service itself. I know there&#039;s a lot of people who&#039;s PGP key is tied to a&nbsp; Tormail addy<br /><br />Even if Tormail goes down forever or are compromised, would that in any way affect future use of the PGP key?

				Also, as long as you didnt incriminate yourself in any msg&#039;s on tormail...you&#039;re ok.....and if you dont go to other .onion sites hosted by FH...you&#039;re ok....stay away from CP and use your head.....be smart...be safe&nbsp; :)<br />

				heck no....you have a key set to at least 4096 it would take 90 years +<br />to crack your <br />PGP msg&#039;s ...unless you&#039;ve been an idiot and leaked stuff somewhere...or ...unless your pc has been compromised...do more research.....educate yourselves....dont rely on people to tell you all this stuff...look where we are??&nbsp; there are fucking idiots all around you that want nothing more than to see you go down....period...<br /><br /><br />research and educate...<br /><br /><br />;)<br /><br /><br />Peace &amp; Hugs to you All<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />&nbsp; O0

				allright, thanks. Silk Road is about the only reason I use TOr and didn&#039;t use my Tormail account except for a few times.. Didn&#039;t have any reason to as long as I could message people here. I didn&#039;t think it would be too much of a problem as long as they don&#039;t have the private key<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;ll be one of those legacy things where people have PGP keys tied to an old Tormail account that doesn&#039;t work anymore

				Make a master PGP key, use said master PGP key to sign your other keys. Master key should have no working email address &quot;ksjdlfjkdnobody@ksljdfk3498.com&quot;. Now if Tormail goes down, you can just sign a new key to use a different email service, such as privatdemail.net or Tor PM, or your own email service. <br /><br />Read what Bruce Schneier has to say about passwords and PGP encryption, 2048 is what you should be using for a variety of reasons according to him. Hashcat forums also a good resource for password breaking like the guy who cracked crypto.cat and Lastpass (useless password safe).<br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of Tor mixmasters around for sending encrypted emails, or you can setup on a nymserver for free and even have it sent to Usenet and just download alt.binaries.messages to retrieve mail anonymously.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The people who ARE going to have problems are those who did not use PGP to protect their message <br />traffic, and/or were less than careful in what they revealed about themselves. <br /><br />It&#039;s almost a given that LEA is going to be conducting relationship analyses on the database: they&#039;re intereseted in who is talking to <br />whom, regardless of whether or not they can read the message traffic proper.

				does anyone know what tormail&#039;s data renetion policy was and/or account expiration (after not receiving/sending mail or after not logging in for x number of days?)<br /><br />i may have created some accounts years back, as well as an account recently, i cant remember if i used it for anything really... i never used pgp on it so im just praying i never left any personal info on there, i cant imagine i would but feeling like youre unsure sucks.
