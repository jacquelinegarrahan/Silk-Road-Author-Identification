				I got a package with pretty bad stealth today.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a sample order and the pills weren&#039;t even in a ziploc bag...they were wrapped with a tiny ripped up shred of a kleenex and with scraps of paper inside half a torn and crumbled envelope.&nbsp; The package was mailed in a very small old reused bubble mailer that only stuck together on the sealed flap halfway.&nbsp; The address was handwritten with poor handwriting.<br /><br />I sent the vendor a note, and they are kinda new.&nbsp; Should I state that the stealth was poor in the review, or give him/her a chance to respond to the message?&nbsp; They seem nice enough and I am assuming they just didn&#039;t know better.<br /><br />I mean I did get what they advertised, and it came quickly.&nbsp; I do not want to hurt their chances of becoming a reputable vendor, I want to help and gave some good pointers.&nbsp; I just hope that they take them seriously and don&#039;t get offended by the suggestions.

				Personally, I would leave a review rating the product, communication and packaging.<br /><br />i would give packaging 1/5 without going into detail, then i would write a review on the forum saying the same thing.<br /><br />just be polite about it, and say &quot;would order again if they improve their packaging&quot;<br /><br />It important that we as a community dont ignore things like this as it keeps us all (including the vendor) safe.<br /><br />If the vendor wants to get offended about your criticism, find another vendor. If their a good vendor, they will fix up their stealth, and it will be reflected in other peoples feedback.<br />

				I&#039;d usually PM the vendors and tell them about their packaging.it happened to me several times before..and all of them are willing to listen to your feedback if they are serious about vending in SR.I mean,personally i would&#039;nt give a 1/5 if they are new vendors..

				I think this definitely need to be mentioned so other people are aware<br /><br />Some people are in different situations ( parents house, non approving roomates, college dorms etc ) and when selecting a vendor they should know they are getting a package that is a security risk.

				Yes you should mention bad packaging in feedback. Don&#039;t give specifics, you should not have posted specifics here either.<br /><br />Just say &quot;Very poorly packaged, I am surprised it got through in this state&quot;. I would give a 4/5 if everything else was good and I would not use that vendor ever again.

				Either give them honest feedback and state your problems, or withhold feedback for now, send them a polite message stating the problem, and then base your feedback on the way they handle it.<br /><br />I&#039;d have trouble with such deliveries, not only because of stealth reasons, but also because I wouldn&#039;t want to put anything in my body that apparently gets treated rather carelessly.

				Bad packaging is imho the biggest security risk. This is what is needed to be good in this business. Either you are aware of this and treat this issue seriously or you send out something which looks dodgy as hell and you risk the well-being of your customer. If you want to compete here, be good at packaging, otherwise go deal on the streets.<br /><br />--&gt; please leave bad feedback so potential buyers are aware of these circumstances. If the seller is good and has the will to learn, he will address this issue openly, improve his methods and everybody will be happy, but as you mentioned what you received, this is not acceptable.<br />I mean it&#039;s not like you don&#039;t prepare to sell stuff in this kind of business, it&#039;s probably a whole new world for most of the vendors and this means you should be prepared. If you aren&#039;t, this shows how much you aren&#039;t giving a fuck and you just care for fast money.

Be honest though.<br />Stealth isnt as important if its domestic ( u.k as far as i now anyway) its more the quality of packaging, if its falling and apart and the scent of the product is easily to smell, then there should be worry.

				most definately, but if u are still happy with the product leave 5/5 feedback score to keep the sellers selling stats at wot they are, cos at the end of the day u still got what u paid for...<br /><br />most new vendors (not all) have problems with packaging at the start, but usually get there shit sorted when buyers bring it to their attention via PMs, feedback or reviews...<br /><br />regards...
