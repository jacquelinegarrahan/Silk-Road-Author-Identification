				I&#039;ve had one of my cash deposits take 36 hours before, but after emailing them it was deposited very quickly. Have you sent an email? Which bank did you deposit at? Did you email them a copy of the receipt and the order number?

				Had the same issue. Don&#039;t worry guys, they will fill your orders. Took over 24hrs to fill mine, and support never answered my queries due to what I believe is probably them being really busy. I know it sucks, but things happen. I know what I wanted to buy sold out before I got my coins even though I thought to myself I was being smart by ordering way before the stock got low. Just be patient, that is all there is to say.

				finally got a response from get-bitcoin:<br /><br />Dear Customer:<br /><br />Thanks for using GetBitcoin! All of your Bitcoins have been sent from our Bitcoin client to your address. <br />However, it appears that our connection to the Bitcoin network is currently experiencing difficulties, so <br />some of them may not have been posted to the Bitcoin network yet. We&#039;re terribly sorry about the delay, and <br />we&#039;re working on the problem now; we expect to have it resolved by tonight or tomorrow (Thursday). <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is the second time they&#039;ve gone over that so-called 24 hour &quot;guarantee&quot;, I didn&#039;t get my service free that time and I won&#039;t be surprised if they keep their 5% fee this time as well. Fucking lame.
