				Aside from keeping your computer secure, what precautions do you take against a potential LE raid? Where do you hide your drugs? Is there any way around a sniffer dog finding stuff? <br /><br />Obviously don&#039;t be too specific because that&#039;s a security risk but I&#039;m looking for general ideas and more looking to see if it is possible to hide them successfully in your home.

				Buy a small waterproof/fireproof safe. They aren&#039;t very expensive.<br /><br />Dig a shallow hole somewhere in your garden. Put the safe in the hole and cover with about 1-2inches of soil. Then put something non-conspicuous on top of it like a small inflatable pool. Dig some other holes in your garden and plant some fruit/vegetables/plants so it looks like you do a bit of gardening (so they have no incentive to dig up the ground even if they found the hidden hole). <br /><br />

				... i guess, a &quot;sniffer&quot; - dog will &quot;find&quot; your drugs, doesn&#039;t matter where you hide them... (if they are inside your house)<br />... best you only have a stash of drugs, you can get over it, when u have to flush them in the toilette... (if police shows up...)

				just hide your drugs well, and in preparation for sniffer dogs keep a bong with rancid water in plain site. when police with dogs show up, spill bong and they won&#039;t be able to use dogs. getting charged with a bong as opposed to getting caught with well hidden drugs is definately the lesser of two evils

				Making everything small like drugs would freak me out.<br />I know of a previous drug dealer who used to pay a guy a small amount of $ to keep a locked safe at his house.<br /><br />Otherwise, I don&#039;t really hide drugs in my house.<br />As I don&#039;t do all that many, they disappear really quick.<br /><br />If I did, I&#039;d probably keep it in a safe somewhere.. that if a raid came I&#039;d be fucked if they had dogs.<br />The rancid bong water&#039;s a pretty good idea.

				I didn&#039;t realize dogs couldn&#039;t find LSD, that&#039;s good news and it should be easy to hide. And I wouldn&#039;t mind flushing the mdma and mdpv I have since I don&#039;t have that much. But that&#039;s assuming I&#039;m home at the time.

				It is best to NOT hide them at your home.<br /><br />They can be on your property somewhere, but they do not need to be in your home.<br /><br />Honestly, it should not even come up when it comes to personal use.<br /><br />This should only be your concern if you are a dealer. At this point, they don&#039;t need to be anywhere near you unless you are out working. Trust me, freedom is worth that extra step.

I remember watching numerous youtube vids about how sniffer dogs are trained. The main thing to take away from these vids is that dogs can only be trained to seek out 1 specific scent. Ie. only MDMA, or only Amphets or only Weed. Dogs are not trained in multiple scents. However, the dogs are also trained techniques to give a &quot;false positive&quot; result. For instance, if the handler suspects there&#039;s drugs hidden under a floor tile, however the dog isn&#039;t trained in that scent, the handler will get the dogs interest in that spot by scratching and tapping it while whispering encouraging words/sounds.<br /><br />Take this with a grain of salt and definitely do not take my word for it - watch the videos, read about it on the net and educate yourselves.<br /><br />Also, masking the smell of drugs with a stronger scent like coffee or perfume will never work because of the way a dog&#039;s sense of smell works - it is completely opposite to a human&#039;s sense of smell. Humans will usually smell a combination of the scents that are in the air, like a smell soup of sorts. Dogs on the other hand smell each scent separately, and if they have indeed been trained to sniff out MDMA, they will completely ignore the scent of weed, perfume, your flatulence and anything else you tried to use to mask the smell. These additional smells will only make the LE more suss!

				If you only have a personal stash at home invest in a small Pelican case (size 1020 is good) and keep it in there. Stash this in your garden somewhere, or bury it if you don&#039;t use that often and you will be fine. They are waterproof, smell proof and can&#039;t be detected by metal detectors.
