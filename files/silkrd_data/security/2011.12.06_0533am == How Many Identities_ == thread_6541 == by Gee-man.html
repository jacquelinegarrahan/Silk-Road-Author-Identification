				when you use the same handle for buying and selling you&#039;re giving away more info that i would be comfortable with to a lot of other SR members who may or may not have your best interests at heart<br /><br />buyers have buyer stats, vendors have reviews and often times their own threads on the forums...why not have a handful of accounts for various purposes as long as you&#039;re consistent,&nbsp; safety in numbers

Some people use the same nickname as they are using tons of other places, others come up with something new that cannot be linked to their real identity in any way. Some people will have one identity when they are selling, and another when they are buying. And some people will probably have different accounts on the forum as well.

				I am asking &quot;stupid/ignorant&quot; questions for a few reasons: <br /><br />1) It seems that there seems to be range of behaviors on certain things - (use of / renewing IDs, acquiring bitcoins, information security, disclosure of certain behaviors, etc.)&nbsp; &nbsp;I figured I would directly ask the questions to get some direct opinions.<br /><br />2) One of the specifically stated ways to figure out if one should trust new participants is to check out if they have have a track record on forums / elsewhere - which requires both using a common ID and actually participating in conversations.<br /><br />3) Generally, the attitude towards noob questions has been that it is better to ask that not, so I have just gone for it.<br /><br />Thanks Squirrel &amp; SR for your thoughts.<br /><br />And, yeah, I thought the handle might be pushing the irony button a little bit. :)

Of course, one cannot be sure that the person chatting with a given username is the same as the person with that username on the forums or the main site, but the same can be said of the forums and the main site, and GPG can be used to establish consistent identity when necessary.

				I offered three other alternatives to Gee-man being LE...anyone read that far?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />Social worker, engineer or non LE Fed (USDA, FAA etc).&nbsp; All of those people talk that way at work.<br /><br />On this forum, we are phd level, masters level, we are high school drop outs, we are 45, 70, 19 years old.&nbsp; One thing we all have in common is that we were smart enough to find SR and this forum.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are bums, Engineers, probably some LE who use secretly, Secretaries, Dishwashers, Lawyers, Writers, Teachers etc.&nbsp; What we all have in common is discretion.&nbsp; Collectively we see all styles of writing, speech and acceptability.&nbsp; All vary from group to group a lot! <br /><br />If LE is reading this, why don&#039;t you go hunt down that one poster in this forum who was looking for Ricin or some other poisons.&nbsp; He is way more threatening to the general public.

				In the end, only the paranoid survive, so really no harm / no foul in questioning unusual behavior.<br /><br />Ultimately, calling out unusual behavior only protects the group (as is it&#039;s intent).&nbsp; It was also a lesson for me.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be the first time I have stuck in out in crowd.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fortunately, I am generally a pretty fast learner.&nbsp; So we will see how it goes from here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lesson learned, and I appreciate the input.

				I have lived many different lives in my short time on earth, and have seen a lot of very different cultures that sometimes exist side by side with no crossover.&nbsp; Every now and then one of us moves to another culture sometimes without realizing it.<br /><br />If we live long enough and live inquisitively we can learn a lot about acceptable speech patterns, posture and expressed emotion not only in different careers but also in different economic structures.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example:<br /><br />A factory that also has office space.&nbsp; Most of the factory workers have limited formal education, not all but most, and exist side by side with the engineers of said factory.&nbsp; Neither is &quot;better&quot; than the other but their worlds are very different.&nbsp; Someone who came from one world and moved to the other would have a serious period of adjustment while they learned the new rules no matter which group they were moving into or out of.&nbsp; They would need to talk different, sit different, laugh louder or softer etc all the very small details would have to be learned.<br /><br />Kind of like when one gender tranforms to another gender. <br /><br />I like to people watch and I do find it interesting.&nbsp; Of course, my experience is limited to certain areas of the world so there&#039;s so much more to learn.<br /><br />I dont do this for a living or anything so I may be talking out my butt, but I do like it.
