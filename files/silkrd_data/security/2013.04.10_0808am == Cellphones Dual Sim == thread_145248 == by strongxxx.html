				Probably, I think its got someting to do with your phone IMEI number being sent out, regardless of sim.<br /><br />A vendor on here was selling phones with zerod out IMEIs and said something about that

				Yeah.. <br /><br />Your phones IMEI ( or whatever its called )&nbsp; gets logged with your provider as soon as you turn on your phone.. <br /><br />So both sim cards will log in with their separate provider and provide your IMEI to them at start up..&nbsp;

				Question has been answered.<br />Would like to add this<br /><br />What can be done is, to use a ordinary phone and connect the battery with wires to its connection point in the phone.<br />In such a way , so when you pull out your sim, the phone has still power.<br /><br />If you can obtain a sim of someone else you can make calls on that sim, even if you have pulled out the sim.<br />So if you don&#039;t like someone, but he or she will give his or her phone, you can shuff it in your special prepped phone and take their phone-number with you, in order to make calls at those individuals expenses <br />You just can not lose the power, for the phone will forget the sim immediately.<br /><br />That&#039;s why the sim is always under the battery.<br />Not a coincidence !<br /><br />Maybe this doesn&#039;t work on new phones anymore, but old phones do remember the sim even when the sim is not in the phone anymore.<br />If the power was not disconnected, the phone will remember the sim.<br /><br />You can even have several phones with the same number, while there is only one phone with a chip.<br />When you start to connect those phones to other phones, so incoming calls will be forwarded to a other phone who will forward again, the police will see several phones on different locations, but with the same number. To make it even more difficult for the police you will have to use the phones without the EMEI, indeed.
