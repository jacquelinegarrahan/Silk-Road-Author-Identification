				I was thinking of getting some anonymous debit cards to use for cashing out<br /><br />I was also debating if I should use it for something legal I am doing too, but I am unsure if it is illegal to own the debit cards in the U.S. -- If what I am doing is legal in all aspects I don&#039;t want to use illegal debit cards..<br /><br />But also, I was looking into using these for illegal transactions also. <br /><br />Does anyone know what is up with these in the U.S?

				Not really a great idea.<br /><br />You can get the euro cards and get boned on fee&#039;s.<br /><br />You can&#039;t really get any actual American cards without giving up your social/etc.<br /><br />So. To cut the shit and just answer the question: Not good.

				It&#039;s not illegal or else they wouldn&#039;t be selling them. It&#039;s just the anti-anonymous.

				You talking about the greendot cards? I pulled $1000 one time, and another 1000 off mine 2 weeks apart. They shut it the fuck down and i&#039;m banned from greendot 4 lyfe. Refused to tell me why. Motherfuckers even took the $12 left on the card!

				OP, are you asking because someone mentioned on here the other day that the &#039;Poland prepaid cards&#039; were being watched or whatever?<br /><br />So you&#039;re asking how the FBI/DEA/DHS/Whoever would monitor these cards for investigations? <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone has that kind of intel here. And if they do...<br />1) They&#039;re certainly not going to share it in public<br />or<br />2) They&#039;re LEO (How are you all doing today?)<br /><br />

				All countries trace foreign cards. Since these cards are usually VISA or MC network they can easily trace them to find the origin of funds. If you have an offshore bank account w/ATM card, you never use it in your own country. You would buy one of these anonymous cards, sell some bitcoins and have a bank wire load the card. Expensive, but anonymous. <br /><br />You would also switch up ATMs all the time. You shouldn&#039;t even bother with ATM cards when we have localbitcoins people everywhere to cash you out. If there isn&#039;t a guy in your city, then you become the localbitcoins guy selling coins to cash yourself out. You can also just build your own fixed-rate bitcoin selling service. If you&#039;re ballin&#039;, no reason you can&#039;t approach a place in your city like a &quot;Cambio Exchange&quot; or currency exchange storefront, and make a deal with them to sell your coins to the public for cash.
