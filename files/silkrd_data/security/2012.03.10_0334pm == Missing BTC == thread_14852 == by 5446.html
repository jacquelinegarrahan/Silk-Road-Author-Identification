				Ok, so I&#039;m more than pissed off. I&#039;ve just transferred nearly 50BTC from my instawallet to my SR BTC address, and nothing has shown up. There are now no coins in the instawallet OR on my SR account. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? It says be careful on the instawallet site, so I was bloody careful, haven&#039;t been hacked, brand new copy of windows installed to do this transfer, I&#039;ve got screenshots of both my instawallet account with the BTC in there, and of my SR account page with the relevant BTC address still there. What can I do? It seems I&#039;ve taken every precaution I can, and still am getting fucked over by it.

				How long has it been? It can take a while sometimes, like 6 hours.<br /><br />Also, I thought instwallet was gone?

				It has to do 6 confirmations, can take up to 2 hours probably max but sometimes longer in some circumstances.

				Hello, thanks for the replies guys. It has been coming up with &quot;not enough balhblahblah&quot; for the past god knows how long on IW, and then it appears now to have gone through with 0BTC in Instawallet, but also 0BTC in SR. I thought it would just keep repeating the &quot;not enough&quot; message until there were enough and it could instantly go through, am I wrong?<br /><br />And no, Instawallet was being shut down, but has now been bought out by Bitcoin Central I think.

This means that it mixes them up with several other people&#039;s coins and makes several transfers to several wallets with varying amounts of coins in each transfer before giving you your share. This is a measure to make it more difficult to track your coins and find out where the money came from. It takes several hours, but your coins will show up eventually. Don&#039;t worry. :)

				So it&#039;s just me being stupid. So not used to this way of working with drugs, I&#039;m always involved in upfront deals where I can see my cash. Thanks for such quick responses to put my mind at ease, absolutely bloody stella community you&#039;ve got here, I&#039;d love to get involved more if I can get comfortable with the way this all works, as I could bring some things to SR myself. =)

				Be patient.&nbsp; This kind of crap happens.&nbsp; I&#039;d give it about 24 hours and if you still haven&#039;t received anything I would contact SR.&nbsp; They usually can track it down and make things right.
