				A normal browser is fine, but I STRONGLY recommend using a logless VPN or secure proxy to connect.<br /><br />As for depositing to a bank account, sure they can. But I suggest accepting cash instead.

What if no ones in my area? I was under the impression if you were under $10,000 a month that you can use the the larger BTC vendors? Selling them was easy with bitfloor,&nbsp; Now I am a little confused on how I actually get my cash on a sale.

				You arrange a trade on localbitcoins.com and meetup with the cash party at a location with internet access. You transfer the agreed upon amount of BTC to the localbitcoins.com holding address just before meeting. It tells you exactly where to send it when a trade is opened.<br /><br />When meeting, inspect the cash in question. If it&#039;s over $1000 (don&#039;t do this on a first trade), you&#039;ll want to use a UV light ($20-30) to detect counterfeit notes, as well as bone up on your knowledge of detecting counterfeit notes in general. After verification, release the payment on localbitcoins.com and the trade is done.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to leave feedback for the successful transaction and tell the BTC buyer to do the same.<br /><br />If you want to be extra careful, make sure you only login to localbitcoins.com from a logless VPN that accepts Bitcoin. This includes whenever you&#039;re on a coffee shop&#039;s wi-fi.<br /><br />Lastly, it&#039;s up to you whether you decide to use the SMS verification service or not. That&#039;s more for the BTC buyer than anything else. One of these days they&#039;ll come up with encrypted texts that are compatible with TextSecure and other apps. Until then, they&#039;re out in the open.

				WOW! First time I&#039;ve ever heard that.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />All I can say is that, from a legal perspective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with trading BTC for dollars or dollars for BTC. If you cross the $10,000 reporting threshold, then you can end up in some hot water. Otherwise, you&#039;re golden.<br /><br />If some LE wiseass decides to meetup with you, then tell him this is a perfectly honest, transparent and LEGAL business transaction- and you don&#039;t appreciate him wasting your time. Be polite, but use your authority and don&#039;t put up with any shit.<br /><br />If he suggests anything as to the origin or destination of the BTC or the cash in question, tell him nothing. Don&#039;t lie! DON&#039;T SPEAK. Those are fucking police state tactics that aren&#039;t even used at the border unless you&#039;ve been flagged.<br /><br />LE has no recourse if there is insufficient incriminating evidence and one doesn&#039;t incriminate themselves. A lot of times people will lie to the police (they may be 100% innocent and simply nervous), or say something dumb to throw them off the scent. Very, very stupid which almost always works against them and leads to an easy conviction.<br /><br />Learn to assert your rights. If you don&#039;t, then no amount of stealth shipping methods, electronic security, or other digital know-how will be able to protect you when you&#039;re out in the real world dealing with people.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160872.msg1146526#msg1146526">Quote from: tit4tat007 on May 20, 2013, 07:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you are a vendor on here or have drugs at home I would NOT USE LBC! <br /><br />On several occasions the person who met up with me was a police officer.
