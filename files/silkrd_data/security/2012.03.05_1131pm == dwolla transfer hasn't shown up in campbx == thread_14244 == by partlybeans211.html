Anyone else having similar problems?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had the weirdest experience with DWOLLA that I would tell anyone and everyone NOT to use them. Nor Mt.Gox. I registered for both by suggestions here in the Silk Road Forums by a senior member. Not saying the misled me or anything like that. <br /><br />BUT; I have been trying to buy my own bitcoins for months now. I still have not been successful! I registered with both DWOLLA (to get money from my personal bank account) and Mt.Gox to buy my coins with. After registering DWOLLA instructed me to add my name on my personal bank account, my routing number, etc. After that DWOLLA deposited 2 deposits into my account they said to verify me. They deposited $0.01 USD deposit and $0.06 USD deposit. They claimed it would take about 3 days to verify. <br /><br />3 days later I sign back into DWOLLA to check on my verification and there were their deposits to my account (I verified the same information with my online banking access of my personal account). So I&#039;m under the assumption I can now deposit money from my personal account into my DWOLLA account to be sent to Mt.Gox. <br /><br />That&#039;s when the weird stuff started. I went to sign into my DWOLLA account and it said that they had been hacked and that I needed to change my password to DWOLLA by inserting a single character anywhere in my password. That weird-ed me out completely, but what else could I do. So I add the single character and log in. It shows my request to draw $100 USDs from my personal bank account, but that I needed to be verified. <br /><br />DWOLLA verification instructions:<br /><br />It said they needed photo copy of my DL AND utility bill or water bill or phone bill, etc. in my name and no older than 3 months. <br /><br />The following verification requirements are copied directly from the DWOLLA verification page and pasted here: <br /><br />&quot;•The name on this document(s) must be in Latin characters, if they are not we require a notarized English translation to be mailed to us.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;•Notarization alone will not suffice; we need an Apostille. Notaries can do this in most countries (please see http:://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_convention)&quot; &lt; this link actually exists, but checking it out just made me feel more uncomfortable.<br /><br />&quot;For Notarized Documents&quot; •Your notarization must include the wording &quot;Notarization for the purpose of verifying on DWOLLA.com&quot;<br /><br />I immediately contacted DWOLLA e-mail support and they said it was the weekend (which it was - a holiday week end to boot!) and that they had limited support available, but that they would check it out. This was a &#039;form&#039; response. <br /><br />On the following Tuesday (I believe was the next business day) I received an e-mail saying they had made a mistake and that I was in fact verified and that the $100 transfer from my personal bank account would be going through in just a few hours. <br /><br />By then I didn&#039;t know who I was talking to so I spent the extra coin (my phone minutes are never free and very expensive. It is an emergency phone. But this was too weird sounding and although I had never been &#039;hacked&#039; before - to my knowledge, it sure felt like what being &#039;hacked&#039; would feel like. <br /><br />I called the 888 number at DWOLLA for customer service and spoke with a &#039;Katlin&#039;. She was a pleasant sounding young lady and assured me that DWOLLA had not been hacked and that DWOLLA would never ask a customer to change their password. AND finally that the instructions I described to here (pasted above) were not from DWOLLA. <br /><br />Okay, so what happened? I don&#039;t know, but I told &#039;Katlin&#039; to cancel my account and halt the transfer from my bank account. She said that she could cancel my account, but that the transfer would go through no matter what. She informed me I would have to have my bank stop it, but they said they could not either. <br /><br />That afternoon my money was taken from my personal account, but that it would be safe and I could just take it back. But when I checked my account on line, the money was not in it. So I filed a affidavit stating I had closed the DWOLLA account and ordered them NOT to take the $100 from my account well before they did it. <br /><br />Yesterday I got a letter from the fraud investigation department of my bank stating that they had traced the money and gained control of it again. <br /><br />Whew! I still don&#039;t really know what had happened. Just another weird thing that seems to follow the ever elusive bitcoin with every attempt I&#039;ve had trying to buy them. <br /><br />If I didn&#039;t have DWOLLA, then I didn&#039;t need Mt.Gox right? So I went to cancel that account and there were the exact - word for word strange verification requests that I pasted above off the DWOLLA account verification requests. Word for word! Except where ever the instructions had &quot;DWOLLA&quot; the Mt.Gox had the word &quot;Mt.Gox&quot;. <br /><br />That did it! I canceled my account and won&#039;t ever go back to either. <br /><br />Today I tried another alleged &#039;bitcoin vendor&#039; - https://get-bitcoin.com/ - was another stranger than strange experience. This was also a suggestion from a nice senior member in the forums on how to easily obtain bitcoins. This entire message is much longer and much more strangeness actually occurred, but you can see how long this detail of what happened is/was, the actual experience spanned about a week in time and dozens of e-mails and conversations with my personal bank, DWOLLA and Mt.Gox.<br /><br />AND here I am, almost 6 months ago I started my search for the elusive mysterious bitcoin and no closer today than I was when I started last year! I my experience with https://get-bitcoin.com/ over the week end and ending with no bitcoins again today, was almost as strange as the DWOLLA/Mt.Gox experience told in short here. <br /><br />If you read this and you really know of a way I can turn my hard earned cash into bitcoins (and I&#039;m not talking about the Silk Road bitcoin vendors - bitcoins are already too expensive! Adding more charges by these vendors is not really a good option to us poor who need to get the best value possible in purchasing coins!) PLEASE - PLEASE - PLEASE!!!! - let me know! I can give you at least 2 members step by step instructions how to anonymously buy bitcoins for minimal service charges that they say they use with no problems. <br /><br />Shrug? Must just be me I guess because neither plan has worked or done anything more than drive me a little crazier about those damn coins!<br /><br />Thanx for your time!<br /><br />Oz<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I made about 7 transfers via Dwolla and then MtGox which is crazy in hind site. No more of that for me. But never had a problem what so ever? it does sound like a hack but to your computer not Dwolla?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard https://get-bitcoin.com is legit also, but have never used them? Not sure how I&#039;m going to get my next coins either:( ....Good Luck. Oh yeah and Dwolla does take about a week to do the whole transfer for what its worth

				Sounds like you got phished on Dwolla. <br /><br />I recommend just using Bitinstant. Deposit to any chase or bank of america, and get the money sent to mtgox easily. You can have coins within the hour.

				Just so you all know, DWOLLA screwed me big time. You have to give them your personal bank account and routing number to be verified. That gives them complete access (according to my bank manager) to your account, even if there&#039;s no money in it. They took $100 dollars US out of my account when I canceled that transfer because they were just acting weird both in e-mails and on the phone. <br /><br />My bank tried to charge me first an overdraft fee ($38.00 US) and then when I filed an affidavit with them saying I canceled that transfer, the money was returned to my bank. But now they want to charge me a stop payment fee. I didn&#039;t order one so they locked my account and took my card. <br /><br />That&#039;s what DWOLLA did for me. I really hope no one here that uses the DWOLLA/Mt.Gox link had similar experiences but this is what happened to me. I lost a personal bank account that I had for years and years and they will eventually send the $40 dollar charge to collections soon. I won&#039;t be able to open another account for 7 years.<br /><br />Thanks DWOLLA!<br /><br />Oz

If you know, please PM me so I&#039;ll know someone commented or wrote about what I .... wrote, lol, about. And let me know how! Lol! <br /><br />I am very happy you didn&#039;t have any problems with the DWOLLA/Mt.Gox combo Lilith. I&#039;m still trying to get my personal bank account back. After DWOLLA took my money, my bank had me sign an affidavit that I ordered them NOT to take my money. The bank went back and got their money, but are trying to charge me $40 bux US for a stop payment. They said with out it DWOLLA could take more money out of that account even if there is no money in it. I specifically told then NO! They did it anyway. They are stalling making a decision to take me to collections or just forgiving a charge they made without my permission. They are as bad as DWOLLA!<br /><br />Anyway Lilith, that&#039;s what DWOLLA has cost me - a bank I had done business with for years! Personally I hate all banks anymore. They all do what is good for them! Not the customer. Now if I had millions, yeh, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be treated much different. <br /><br />Again, sorry for how I am. I can&#039;t do anything about that. If anyone does know how I can get notified when someone posts so I can answer them, let me know. I&#039;ll try to understand what you&#039;ve written. <br /><br />Thanx<br /><br />Oz
