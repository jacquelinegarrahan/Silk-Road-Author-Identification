				So when I start to make purchases, I plan to send my real name and real address via PGP encryption. Every time I make a new order, I plan to make a new public key.<br />Also, when I purchase bitcoins, I plan to send it from my coinbase account, to my mtgox account, back to my coinbase, then to my SR wallet.<br /><br />Using these techniques, how safe am I?

				If your only making small purchases for yourself, i&#039;d just have the coins sent directly to your SR account. SR have their own tumblers.<br />If you do it that way, just change your SR addy every month you&#039;ll be fine.

				I see, thank you very much. I know many vendors take security very seriously, I just want to abide by their rules to protect everyone :)

				When you send a dealer a message you&#039;re encrypting it with their public key, yours doesn&#039;t get used unless you&#039;re signing the message (you shouldn&#039;t do that). So no need to create new keys all the time.<br /><br />When sending btc to Silk Road you ought to use the official Bitcoin client and send through TOR. Send your coins from the source to your wallet, wait a couple of days then send to Silk Road. This way it looks like you&#039;ve sent the coins on to someone and maybe they ended up in Silk Road&#039;s mixer (if anyone can even tell). After the coins have been sent and your wallet.dat is empty, shred &amp;&amp; rm it. <br /><br />If you just send coins immediately after 6 confirmations then there&#039;s no point in you bouncing them around, it&#039;s pretty obvious that it&#039;s the same person mixing them up.

				I have never used a 3rd party tumbling service, i just go from my bitcoin seller to my SR wallet, i then change my SR wallet address after every transaction. There is really no point in changing your PGP key - 4096 bit keys will not be cracked for the next 10 or more years.
