				I am in quite the predicament and could use some help. I sent a very large amount of coins to my NON-SR wallet app. The problem is that I had just installed bitcoin on my new computer and it wasn&#039;t updated with all the past block history. Now I essentially am facing a deadline from the vendor I am supposed to buy from and wondering two things: is it safe for me to download and &quot;install&quot; the latest blockchain data; and how exactly would I go about replacing the file. Sorry if this is a noob question and I appreciate the help!

				1.&nbsp; Yes, it is completely safe to receive the block chain.&nbsp; This is information we all share anyway, there is nothing there that you should worry about.<br />2.&nbsp; You don&#039;t replace the file, simply run bitcoin-qt and the first thing it does is downloads all the blocks in the chain until it is updated.<br /><br />In my experience, it only takes bitcoin-qt a few (tens of) minutes to catch up to the latest block even when I run it for the first time.<br /><br />The other thing you could do is extract your private key from your wallet and put it in an online wallet (that allows such a thing, like blockchain.info import.)&nbsp; In this way you could spend the coin immediately.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t recommend that people new with the technology, as I&#039;m assuming you are, attempt such a thing.<br /><br />Run bitcoin-qt and you&#039;ll be able to spend your coin soon.

				Thanks for the help. Unfortunately my problem with bitcoin-qt is that has been stuck updating at 95% of the blocks for over 14 hrs. So do I just type my private key into the box on that site?
