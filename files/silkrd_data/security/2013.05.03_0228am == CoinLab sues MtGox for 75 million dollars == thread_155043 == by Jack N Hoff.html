				Title: <strong>CoinLab sues MtGox for 75 million dollars</strong><br />

				The two companies are in the business of Bitcoin exchange, which plays a central role in the Bitcoin economy. For all the hype surrounding Bitcoin&#039;s promise as the &quot;future of currency,&quot; at present it&#039;s not really good for buying much. So all those Bitcoin millionaires must exchange Bitcoins for actual currency if they want to actually get any use out of it. The trades on the exchanges also set the closely-watched price of Bitcoin. (Currently hovering around $100.) Mt. Gox is the world&#039;s largest Bitcoin exchange. It handles about $6 million in trades a day, accounting for 76 percent of trades worldwide, according to The Verge. Coinlab is a relative newcomer to the Bitcoin game, but has received notice for attracting $500,000 in venture capital and partnering with Silicon Valley Bank.<br /><br />This February, Mt. Gox and Coinlab announced they were forming a strategic partnership to expand Bitcoin services in North America. It seemed like a perfect match: Mt. Gox has years of experience handling hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions, and a massive customer base, but they&#039;re based in Japan and so have can&#039;t service American customers efficiently. Coinlab is a small but savvy upstart based in Seattle, looking to expand. The partnership would allow Mt. Gox to access the huge U.S. market through a capable partner, and Coinlab could latch onto Mt. Gox&#039;s reputation and existing customer base.<br /><br />Coinlab alleges that Mt. Gox has breached a contract clause which was supposed to give Coinlab exclusive access to the North American market. &quot;Defendants have breached the exclusivity provisions of the Agreement by directly servicing customers in the United States and Canada since the Agreement took effect,&quot; the lawsuit states.<br /><br />Coinlab also says Mt. Gox hasn&#039;t allowed them to transition existing U.S. and Canadian customers from Mt. Gox to Coinlab, as agreed in the contract. &quot;Despite repeated requests to do so, Mt. Gox has failed to deliver all passwords, Yubikeys, administrative logins and any other security information required so that CoinLab may assume operation of the Bitcoin exchange services for customers in the United States and Canada.&quot;<br /><br />Coinlab is demanding $75 million in damages, and even that, it says, &quot;likely underestimates the actual damages.&quot;<br /><br />If it&#039;s true that Mt. Gox botched the deal, it&#039;s a big setback for the company, which has had a rocky past. An ongoing series of hacks, outages and other weirdness has led many in the Bitcoin community to question whether Mt. Gox is stable enough to be a major Bitcoin broker. Whenever Mt. Gox experiences downtime or a problem, the price of Bitcoin drops noticeably: Not a good look for what&#039;s supposed to be a radically decentralized currency<br /><br />The Coinlab-Mt. Gox juggernaut was supposed to bring a new level of service, along with the legitimacy that came with the Silicon Valley Bank&#039;s backing, to Mt. Gox and the economy as a whole. The partnership was considered so important to the growth of Bitcoin that some observers credited it with sparking a massive 40% surge in Bitcoin prices past $250 when it was first announced, during which some big Bitcoin hold probably made millions. (At least until the price crashed back down again.) Now the biggest hope of Bitcoin has devolved into the biggest lawsuit.<br /><br />Bitcoin might someday be utterly worthless, but it&#039;s clear there&#039;s big money to be made, and lost, right now.<br /><br />CoinLab,<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What tipped us into filing was our complete inability to get Mt. Gox to deliver on the few simple things left that were needed for customers to move over en-masse; we were often left just apologizing to our alpha customers while their own businesses suffered. I&#039;m just not willing to put any of our customers in that position â€” if we can&#039;t do a good job for you, I won&#039;t promise that we can.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://gawker.com/massive-bitcoin-business-partnership-devolves-into-75-487857656

				CoinLab will fail either way, unless they miraculously hold more coinage than Mt Gox... Do those people not know that Satoshi Nakamoto is the backer of Mt. Gox?

				i&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s more the case that gox has been swamped so bad by that big bubble last month and the ongoing attempts to game their exchange that they have been too busy to get the contract terms sorted out. also, a LOT of people with gox accounts in the USA do NOT want FinCEN having such free access to their data.<br /><br />I dunno about this fawning love of gox, I personally have been fucked over by them and their service is terrible, because I used tor to access my account, and inadvertently started to open a second account forgetting I&#039;d started the process before and stopped because I was unable to get proof of address, or something along those lines. I use bitstamp and their service is great, and apart from the occasional torwall, I have no problems using their service with tor, though I have stopped doing that anyway, just to get the irritating &#039;just one more step to access bitstamp&#039; page that i get every other day when I use tor to access bitstamp.

Never did I say that the US Gov does not want is is not trying to gain control of the trade. Have you looked up who really owns the Silicone Valley Banks??

The cosa nostra are still very prominent in the south of italy, but they are not the mafia you used to see on the Tv and in the movies anymore.trust me.
