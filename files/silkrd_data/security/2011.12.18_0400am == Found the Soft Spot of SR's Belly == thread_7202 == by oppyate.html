				On all other sites, be it Ebay, Amazon, bangme,com, etc,&nbsp; Once you complete Tranasaction Feedback, it’s pretty much a done and sealed and possibly reversible a day or two later. After that, it what you wrote becomes electronic zeros, ones and code.<br /><br />On SR., as you know. You can go back weeks, months and change your 5 to a one, or less likely, a one to a 5.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was just wondering why that is?<br /><br />I was noticing in the ongoing Cartel Wars, Buyers vs. Sellers, Esrow vs. Feedback that in Italian we have a term called “Navaja de Revenga.” Means Knife Of Revenge.<br /><br />Changing FeedBack Scores is an Exposed Belly to Navaja de Revenga.<br />

				Good point.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know that I&#039;d call it a soft spot on the belly, more like a hangnail that you were chewing on and tore the skin off halfway up to your elbow. Annoying as shit, but not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Yeah, it should be a reasonable amount of time, say 3 weeks, after the sale is finalized and escrow is released, that feedback is locked in.<br /><br />It can&#039;t really be much less than that because of folks who finalize and release before the vendor ships. Gotta allow time for them to get the product and try it out, before it&#039;s locked from being edited.

				Yea, it&#039;s not necessarily a weakness as much as it is a bug.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a couple ghost feedbacks from months ago come back to haunt me, most of which seem to come from the guilty pleasure one feels from being able to shit on someone else with impunity.<br /><br />Either that or I have unconsciously solicited homosexual fallacio from my customers and then deleted all records..

				good thinking.<br /><br />I think with ebay it&#039;s about 60 or 90 days, due to some international orders taking 4 weeks I&#039;d say 30 days to be on the safe side is a ok amount of time.<br /><br />possibly move thread to feature section?
