				Do mods trim or check the user database in Silk Road?<br /><br />For example, if sellers/scammers create accounts just to give 5/5 feedbacks, can&#039;t mods check stats to see a trend?<br /><br />A scammer who has a lot of 5/5 feedbacks created by users who logged in only once and placed a single order, never returning to SR.<br /><br />This could be easy to check, right?<br /><br /><br />
