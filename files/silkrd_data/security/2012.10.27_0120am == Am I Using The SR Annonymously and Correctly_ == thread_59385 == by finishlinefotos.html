				Okay. So I&#039;ve had worries of the fact that this all may seem just too good to be true. I feel like this is all too easy. But maybe because I&#039;m not doing all that I can to remain secure and anonymous with my transactions, however I have not yet been caught and all 20+ orders of mine have all been received successfully with no problems. So my question is will someone let me know if there are any flaws in how I go about my transactions? Basically bit instant, zip zap, moneygram, mtgox/blockchain, encryption of info, only use reputable vendors. I don&#039;t wanna go into very much detail because I suppose everyone basically understands the process. However I could just be paranoid, but I feel as if there is more that I could be doing to secure my anonymity. Does anyone else feel this way or use the same process am myself?

				20 orders all received without issue? I&#039;d say you&#039;re doing fine just based on that. I&#039;m freaking out about just making my first order, and it&#039;s domestic. I love the products here on SR, but I love keeping my virgin ass free of inmate&#039;s dicks even more, so I hear you about looking to be more secure. I have a hard time deciding what&#039;s reasonable and what&#039;s overkill. I&#039;m overwhelmed with the amount of things involved in keeping yourself ultra-secure as opposed to just pretty secure. I suppose if you&#039;re going beyond 20 orders, you&#039;re at the point where you should take every step you can for safety/anonymity.

				That&#039;s why I posted this because I feel pretty overwhelmed that they&#039;re are more steps to be taken to be extra secure but I&#039;m constantly looking at how to go about it.

				Plenty of guides on here, are you booting from hardrive, that seems to be a big one that I would guess most people miss.&nbsp; If you are doing anything bulk I wouldn&#039;t worry though..

				I think you&#039;re doing alright. Just remember that at anytime you could lose all of your last order for any number of reasons and don&#039;t think or SR as a guaranteed thing.

				by booting from harddrive what do you mean? like not using a usb? I just keep tor as a dowloaded folder and start it up like a regular browser? could i be traced this way? what&#039;s the point of a yubikey or a usb?

				after reading a few posts, i think i should download liberte and format my computer although i have no idea what liberte is and start booting Tor off a usb drive. I&#039;m expecting a package soon. I get one just about every week. very regularly. Very paranoid as always before receiving one. What are my chances of being tracked seeing as how I&#039;ve been booting tor off my computer? Can someone help me understand what liberte is and if I&#039;m doing something wrong?

				it sounds to me that you won&#039;t have full peace of mind until you have done all that you can do to protect your anonymity.<br />By reading what you&#039;re doing now it sounds like you&#039;re taking more precautions than 50% of the users on the site.<br />IMO unless you are a vendor, or are buying in bulk, the additional steps are not necessary.<br /><br />I accidentally (stoned) sent my address to a vendor.... IN CLEARTEXT!<br />I felt like such a tool, but no one said a word, it came in the mail, and I&#039;m still a free man.<br /><br />YMMV
