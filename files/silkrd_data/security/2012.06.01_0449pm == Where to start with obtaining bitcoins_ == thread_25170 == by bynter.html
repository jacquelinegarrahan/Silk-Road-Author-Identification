				So here&#039;s my situation: I&#039;m under 18, so a bank transaction is out of the question. I have full access to a Paypal account in mah dad&#039;s name. Meow how should should I go about turning that into BTC, and with whom?<br /><br />Also, When I&#039;m scrolling through the &quot;catalog&quot; and all the prices are in BTC, what should i do to make a quick and rough conversion to USD? Multiply it by 5? 10?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And Once moar, yeah, I&#039;m under 18. Wooh. I was smart enough to get here, I&#039;m smart enough to be responsibru with whatever products I get.

				You can deposit with PayPal on VirWox.com and then convert your USD $ to L$ and then convert the L$ to BTC. I did it with a $60 deposit and ended up only getting $54 worth of BTC but it still works.<br /><br />

				Paypal to virwox is your best bet.&nbsp; I have used it before.&nbsp; You do lose some of it in the transfer because Virwox only allows whole number transfers.&nbsp; There are also other restrictions with virwox that you can read up on bitcoin&#039;s web site.&nbsp; If you are planning to use any transaction that can be traced back to you make sure you hide your trail to SilkRoad by bouncing between wallets/fogger and SilkRoad.&nbsp; If you buy coins at Virwox and send them straight to SR it could be red flagged.&nbsp;

There are vendors on here who do accept MoneyPaks which I understand can be bought with cash, why not contact my good friends BlueSkyTraders, see what they can do for you?<br /><br />V.

				I am not speaking out of experience but I mine my bitcoins.<br /><br />I got myself a gaming computer. Luckily with 2 5850 cars, running crossfire.<br />What I do. Let my computer on when I am away, overclock the GPU core a bit. Downclock the GPU memory. Fans 100%<br />Extra flasgs: -v -w256 -f1<br /><br />When I am using my computer I still mine on both of my cards with diffrend flags: -f 60.<br />with this settings I can do almost anything(stil play LoL etc) without lagging(100~200 FPS ~24 ping)<br />Depends on what you do the mining speed will still be decent. Playing a game will surely slow the speed of mining your bitcoins.<br /><br />1 week could give me at least a bitcoin. Since you&#039;re &lt;18 you might have school. Leave it on mining when you&#039;re on school.<br />And you could actually get some pills for free(at least, in my case)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />~C<br /><br />NOTE: I already had this system. This is not an investment. Since I know of bit coins and silkroad I started mining using my gaming system. Luckilly the 5850 cards are pretty good at mining.
