				Hey guys...<br />Looking for some really creative/clever and perhaps unconventional methods of concealing drugs in your car. For size lets say no larger than a 5 gram bag of anonymous powder.<br /><br />At the moment I just sort of hide whatever I have in plain site (messy car), coupled with driving 100% sober and being a non-weed smoker I am not usually suspect to a search.<br /><br />Interested to see what others are doing...Thanks in advance!

				I don&#039;t have any advice about how to hide stuff, but it jumped out at me that you said you had a messy car. I think it&#039;s much better to keep a very neat car. I got stopped a lot when I worked the night shift, and having a really clean car is, I think, less interesting and less suspicious to a cop.

				everyone needs to watch these two movies<br /><br />How To Never Get Busted Again<br /><br />How To Never Get Raided<br /><br />Both can be streamed online<br /><br />They were written and produced but an ex-supercop (cant remember his name) and are invaluable to people involved in clandestine dealings =) <br /><br />He&#039;s rule of thumb is &quot;if it takes to 10 mins to hide it, it will take the cop 1 hour to find it&quot; <br />If its a small bag you have plenty of small crevices under the dashboard that could easy make it hard for a cop to find it.&nbsp; Remember if you are ever stopped I would suggest to note the time when he officially detains you. At that point its a race to beat the clock on his behalf. I believe its 2:30 hours? If anyone knows for sure please correct me&nbsp; &nbsp;

				They are not going to check my underwear.

				The ex-cop from those videos (Barry Cooper) suggest that you hide it underneath the dash on the passenger&#039;s side if it&#039;s a very small amount. He says there&#039;s many small crevices that it can be stuffed into where it will never be found. He then recommends that you let them search your car if asked (as long as you&#039;re sure you&#039;ve hidden it very well and there&#039;s nothing else illegal lying around).<br /><br />The reason he recommends allowing them to search is, as a cop doing a search, allowing the search is less suspicious, and if he were checking under the dash he would reach around to feel for large amounts of contraband, but he wouldn&#039;t spend a long time searching around for a tiny little bag that MIGHT be in one of the hundreds of different crevices.<br /><br />He says basically every cop will search the dashboard in this way during a routine consented search. The only exception is if they are already suspicious and have moved on to a more extensive search, such as ripping the car apart, calling in the dogs, etc.. If you&#039;re already suspected that much, it&#039;s far too late to get out of it.

So you&#039;ll need a co-conspirator who works in a tire shop and has access to the equipment. But it is necessary to balance a tire after it is remounted so you will need to afix the contraband in the wheel rather than leave it loose. That way it can be accounted for when it is balanced.<br /><br />Then you will need another conspirator at your destination to demount the tire and retrieve the contraband.<br /><br />Finally, you cannot drive far or at high speeds because of the heat a moving tire generates. Add the brake heat transmitted to the wheel and the inside of a tire on a long drive becomes a low-temperature furnace.

If you appear eager to cooperate, their suspicion plummets, I&#039;ve seen it numerous times. Have a clean car, look respectable, be confident, etc. It really isn&#039;t that hard to find excellent places to conceal personal amounts, especially if you&#039;ve spent time working on your car.

				I&#039;m lucky that cars can&#039;t be searched without court warrant except when crossing borders or near them. The pigs who search cars are really knowledgeable so get a rare car but one that does not stick out. Old Renault, Rover or Citroen will do the job. Hiding in tire or gas tank is no-no. The news are all over with people who have hidden contraband in tire, gas tank, doors or airbags.

				Do not EVER consent to a search.&nbsp; In every western country the law explicity states &quot;refusal to consent to a search is not probably cause for a search in and of itself&quot;.&nbsp; if you are moving shit in your car regularly:&nbsp; Keep it washed.&nbsp; Check the bulbs all around and replace any that are damaged.&nbsp; Get any loud noises repaired like serpentine belts squeaking or bearings humming, bushing causing creaking sounds, etc.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want there to be any reason to take a second look at the car.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep the interior clean.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; A police officer&#039;s first impression of you goes a long way in avoiding hassling.&nbsp; Dress well, not &quot;im a rich punk&quot; or anything like that, but think business casual, harmless working guy attire.&nbsp; Be clean shaven or very trimmed facially (70% of people find beards more suspicious than a clean shaven face, because it automatically conveys the impression of hiding one&#039;s face).<br /><br />Keep your shit in your trunk.&nbsp; out of sight and the hardest place to access.&nbsp; When you are talking to the cop, roll down your window about 4-6 inches so you are able to respectfully converse but not enough so he can reach in or be physically threatening.&nbsp; If he asks you to get out of the car, roll up your window, lock the doors after you have left the car, and put the keys in your pocket.&nbsp; If the cop insinuates that he wants to search you, tell him &quot;I don&#039;t consent to any searches of my body or my property&quot;.&nbsp; Cops will usually follow this up with &quot;well, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about, right?&quot;&nbsp; Just tell him &quot;I don&#039;t consent to any searches.&nbsp; Have I done anything wrong?&nbsp; Am I being detained?&nbsp; Can I leave now?&quot;&nbsp; Just keep asking him those questions and eventually he will have to let you go.<br /><br />Remember you want to blend in.&nbsp; I feel bad for anybody who&#039;s a physical minority as you have it way rougher with the cops that us white guys do.&nbsp; that being said, dressing like a thug, regardless of your race, and blaring loud music or driving obnoxiously is going to put you on a cop&#039;s &quot;punk&quot; list.&nbsp; you will not get the respect for your rights you do if you dress like what one typically pictures as a &quot;productive member of society&quot; and are driving like a &quot;responsible citizen&quot; with a low-key car that&#039;s well maintained and isn&#039;t violating any safety statutes, there is no reason you ever should get searched.<br /><br />Just be smart.&nbsp; Everything we do in this game is a numbers game.&nbsp; We are constantly cruising the odds, playing with fate or just plain bad luck.&nbsp; Tip them in your favor.&nbsp; You&#039;ll never have a reason to regret it.

				Just to follow up on what anarcho47 said, at least where I live the cops can&#039;t call in the dogs without articulable cause; i.e. a reasonable suspicion that you may have committed a crime. They can&#039;t just do it on a hunch, or because you refuse to consent to a search. Might be different where you live though.<br /><br />Legally, your best option is to hide the contraband well and follow the &quot;break only one law at a time&quot; rule. If the cops have no reason to detain you, they have to let you go. So even if they stop you at random and you deny them consent to search, they can&#039;t just arbitrarily detain you while waiting for the dogs arrive, just because you won&#039;t let them tear apart your car on a mere hunch. If they do breach that right, you may have constitutional grounds to exclude the evidence.

				Some time ago I thought I might be headed for a jam. I researched the criminal defense lawyers in the city where I lived then booked an appointment with one of significant national renown. He is so famous, I was embarrassed to enter his office on the feeling that &quot;anyone who hires him MUST be guilty.&quot; As our conversation wrapped up he gave me a quick primer on some basics of interacting with LE at crunch time. Long story short, his message to me was unequivocally never ever consent to anything whatsoever under any circumstances, period. No exceptions, not for nothin&#039;. If busted, every first step a defense lawyer will take is to discredit every shred of evidence beginning with illegal search and or illegal seizure. Every act of consent or agreement with LE not only voids that effort but goes a long way to establish the credibility that what was seized was yours. No matter what the later story might be, it won&#039;t work if it all began with you saying &quot;sure, go ahead.&quot;<br /><br />Ever watch the TV show Cops? Every one of those fucking dumbasses consents to a search and is arrested for possession. WTF? The advice to consent based on the feel-good/be agreeable/make it convenient/I&#039;m sure it&#039;s well-hidden &quot;reasoning&quot; will never be heard in court. Your defense lawyer won&#039;t care to hear it, either. In traffic stop situations, the case against you, if there is one, begins there at the side of the road.

I know probable cause is usually hard for the cops to get if you know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />But guess what? If a cop decides to utter the words &quot;I smell marijuana coming from your car&quot; THAT&#039;S probable cause whether he was being truthful or not.<br /><br />&quot;But ExtraSheets,&quot; you may say, &quot;if the cop lied about having probable cause, the case would be thrown out immediately!&quot;<br /><br />When it comes time to go to court, have fun convincing the judge the police were lying.<br /><br />All they&#039;ll see in the videotape is the cop declaring &quot;I smell pot&quot;, proceed to searching your car, and then finding drugs in said car.<br /><br />In court, it&#039;s your word vs. the police (Guess who the judge will go with on that one? Hint: not the guy trying to get his drug possession charges dropped).<br /><br />So in general, I think whether or not you plan on consenting to avoid suspicion, you should always hide your contraband as if you were CERTAIN the police would be searching your car during the transport.

				Cars have enough hiding places you can only get to with a little disassembly, e.g. door panels, roof lining, special compartment in the seat stuffing accessible from under the seat, ect, ect.. <br /><br />Possibilities are endless but if your moving larger amounts like say 100g - 250g of *whatever*, a talcum powder bottle is a good hiding spot. Empty it out and save the powder. Package your product into a tight cylinder, make sure its as solid as you can make it, evenly distributed (So the weight feels right) and air/smell tight. The bit that faces the opening should be smooth, dome-like if possible. <br /><br />Slide the package into the bottle keeping aligned to the center and use a funnel to pack in the talcum powder taking care to distribute evenly. Tap the bottle against the ground to pack it down then fill again - repeat until package is completely covered and tamped. If you figure a way to make it look like it&#039;s never been opened, that&#039;s best but as different styled bottles have different seals I can&#039;t really advise on that. <br /><br />That&#039;s it, the talcum powder smells like talcum powder so even if a LEO gets zealous and goes &#039;Whats this white powder in this here bottle?&#039;, he&#039;ll take a sniff and a taste and consequently assume he&#039;s looking in the wrong place; though I&#039;ve never seen a LEO even looks sideways at one these. Also, if there&#039;s a random dog at a roadblock/border, the talcum powder helps masks any residual scent that may escape due to shoddy packaging or rough handling or whatever...

				just watched the &quot;never get busted&quot; videos. lots of good information in them.&nbsp; don&#039;t leave a roach in your car ashtray. if they see that, it gives them reason to search your vehicle. also remember, you are free to leave as soon as the cop gives you your ticket for whatever traffic law you violated. don&#039;t stick around so the cop can sweet-talk his way into searching or snooping through your vehicle.&nbsp; try getting ahold of the videos. they give you insight on the types of vehicles and people they&#039;re profiling.&nbsp; if you&#039;re driving a low-rider with tinted windows, you&#039;re more likely to be pulled over than a guy driving a 4x4 pickup truck.

				I wish I lived in a country where you could refuse to have your car searched, although it does mean I&#039;ve had opportunity to test my stashes. The panels where your mirrors are normally snap on/off and you can fit a good amount behind them. I can pull up the plastic underneath where the handbrake rests and there&#039;s enough room for an oz of bud in there. The wheel that reclines the seats on my car is again easy to remove and reattach and you could fit powder or a small amount of weed in there, look under your floor mats and you might find a small storage area, although a few police check this area as it&#039;s a well known spot on a popular teenager car.&nbsp; It seems obvious to say but main places to avoid are the pockets in the back of the front seats, sun visors, glove box, cd cases, down the side or under the rear seats, anywhere actually intended for storage.<br /><br />If it&#039;s small enough to hide in your balls this might be preferable, just make sure you use the tuck, I know someone who just chucked it down his boxers thinking it would stay, only to have it drop out as he was walking away. If you have baggy trouser then pull the waistband down right to the top of your dick, anything under there should be sealed in tight, don&#039;t do this if it would look really out of place on you though.

				hey, does anyone know for sure, one way or the other, if K-9s are trained to &quot;hit&quot; on shrooms?<br /><br />thinking of going on a road trip in a few months and wanted to bring like 1/2 Oz with me to eat once I am there - which is several States away.

				I&#039;m not sure about cop dogs, although I&#039;ve never heard of a shroom bust on canines.&nbsp; I know that customs dogs are not trained on mushrooms because I had a friend who worked in US customs about 4 years ago, and another that is still currently working in Canadian customs - both have confirmed that for me.

				lol if there was a way of making a bet I would.&nbsp; I will bet that you DON&#039;T get caught by a canine, say 50BTC.&nbsp; If you do, I&#039;ll need to see proof via an uploaded summons to court for charges of possessing mushrooms ;)<br /><br />Seriously, though.&nbsp; If you are super paranoid about it just get one of those $15.00 hand-pump vacuum sealers and a few vac bags.&nbsp; Keep them in there.&nbsp; Everything I do in the f2f world involves vac-sealed product using vapor-lock bags.

				Customs looks for aftermarket installations and obvious alterations. Like if your roof seems smaller than usual and is a different color, if the upholstry on the seats have different shades/colors anywhere, and known hiding spots like under the dash, in vents, inside the light fixture, and any possible hidden aftermarket panels. The smugglers and delivery dealers here have james bond aftermarket parts where they do a sequence of events (push stereo button, then push lighter twice) and a hidden compartment pops out usually in the console beside them between front drivers seats.<br /><br />http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/12/29/the-cbsas-secret-compartment-specialist/<br /><br />

				#1: Some cars have center arm rests.
