				I was wondering if anyone has done this and how it works. I made a deposit through Bitinstant as usual, except they had taken away the Mt. Gox option but had a Bitstamp option so I opened a Bitstamp account and followed the usual protocol. The only problem is, where my money shows up instantly in Mt. Gox, it didn&#039;t in Bitstamp. Am I missing something? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

				Yes this is currently my preferred method and works great for me.<br /><br />I use bitinstant -&gt; bitstamp account (you just put in your account number). Every time I&#039;ve done it the money has been in my bitstamp account by the time I get home (10-15 mins)<br /><br />You only lose the 4% that bitinstant charges + the $4 zipzap fee so you get back almost all your money back. <br /><br />Once the money is in your bitstamp account just log on and you can place an order for the btc... they usually trade for the same (or sometimes lower) value compared to the weighted avg. <br /><br />Once all your $ is traded for btc (takes a couple mins) then you can just withdrawal them from your account to your SR account or wash them first with something like bitcoinfog.<br /><br />With this method I only pay about 5% more on the listing prices. To calculate my deposits I just multiply the total purchase cost (including shipping) by 1.05 and may add on a few more bucks just to be safe.<br /><br />I just went to make a deposit to bitstamp but I don&#039;t see the option on bitinstant currently... I&#039;m not too sure why but this is what made me run into your thread.<br /><br />Hopefully I was able to help you out some... if you have any other questions let me know and I&#039;ll do my best to answer them.
