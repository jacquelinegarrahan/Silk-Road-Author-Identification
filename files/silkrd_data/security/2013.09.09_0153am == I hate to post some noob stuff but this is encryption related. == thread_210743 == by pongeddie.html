				For some reason when I try to send and encrypted message to certain vendors it just doesn&#039;t work. They tell me there&#039;s no info in the encryption, they get error messages, no secret key, etc. I do the same thing every time, I&#039;ve had success with a few of the weed vendors. The read the message fine. But others just get read my stuff. I&#039;m using GPG, not GPG4USB. When I try to download GPG4USB, I&#039;m on a Mac, I get this message &quot;cannot execute binary file<br />logout<br /><br />[Process completed]&quot;<br /><br />If you can help or even respond. Thanks a lot.

				GPG4USB is only available for Windows and Linux.<br /><br />If they are getting a message that no secret key is available, then you are encrypting the message with the wrong public key. You may be encrypting it with your own key. You need to encrypt it with their public key.<br />

				I feel I know what you&#039;re saying. I post a message in my mail client. I then highlight the message, right click and select &quot;encrypt to new window&quot; after that I choose a recipient. As in I click next to one of the names/emails/public keys that are in my GPG keychain. Then I select which one of my keys I want to send it from. As long as I select a recipient doesn&#039;t that mean I&#039;m encrypting using their key? Then it makes me also select one of my keys, as in, this is who it&#039;s from. Like I have to select one of my keys and then I have the option of whether I want to &quot;sign&quot; it or not.

You encrypt a message with someone&#039;s public key. You should only have to select the recipients. Perhaps when you are choosing one of your keys to &quot;send from&quot; you are actually selecting it to encrypt the message with.<br />

				I choose a recipient then it asks for a &quot;secret key&quot; the available &quot;secret keys&quot; are the public keys that I&#039;ve created in order to communicate with people. I choose a recipient and it won&#039;t let me send unless I select a secret key. Which are my two public keys. So I select one, then it will ask for my passphrase associated with whichever secret key I&#039;ve selected, I put in the password, then I get the encrypted message. I copy and paste the message where ever I need to, usually in a message on SR. With some of the weed vendors they&#039;ve been able to read it, but with other vendors I get the dreaded &quot;couldn&#039;t read it . . .&quot; blah blah blah, no secret key, whatever. I don&#039;t know, I appreciate the help. If one of you wants to give me your key, I guarantee I&#039;ll be able to send you a message. Then I try it on the road and I roll snake eyes. Thanks for your responses.
