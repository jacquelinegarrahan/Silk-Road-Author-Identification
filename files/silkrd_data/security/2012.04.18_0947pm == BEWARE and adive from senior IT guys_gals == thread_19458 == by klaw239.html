				Hello all. So I go bitinstant and MTgox all set up and went to chase and made a deposit today. My funds are now at Mtgox but after My funds were accepted at MTgox I noticed a lag in PC&nbsp; so I started snooping around and I found something disturbing. Has anyone else noticed this...First off I am leeching a connecting from&nbsp; down the road and I am filtering My MAC address. I am running windows XP&nbsp; with all updates&nbsp; (bah!) I have yet to purchase any goods but I noticed MY Computer name had changed as well as my work group and My firewall all the sudden has exceptions and to top that all the exceptions are very shady and filled with holes. AIM,IE, YAHOO messenger, File and printer sharing was all the sudden enabled again after I disabled it. I have done nothing wrong&nbsp; and have nothing on my computer that I would be scared for other to view but I am def doing a low level format and heeding the advice of wiser members here and either booting from USB or buying a laptop with no personal information on it and using it strictly for silk road with the hard drive wiped to zeros after every transaction but I fear My security may have already been compromised. What is even more scary by PC was renamed to the STATE I LIVE IN. Please&nbsp; a higher level IT guy with&nbsp; security expertise offer some insight and advice. This has me pretty spooked. Too all other NooBs let My mistake be a lesson learned for you. Don&#039;t be lazy and follow these guys/gals advice when setting everything up and remember desecration is ALWAYS the better part of valor.&nbsp; I hope I did not fuck my self with a red flag in anyway.

				Hey! welcome to the forums.<br /><br />Im by no means a expert but by far no novice :) I believe its safe to say you do not have a red flag up or are being watched as you said you have brought nothing from here yet and buying BTC is perfectly legal ( for now atleast) But i 100% recommend using librete from a usb drive a guide can be found in the post below. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />If you need any help with the setup just say.

				Thats alright, let me know if you run into any problems, it would be worth doing a wipe on the box that you used to run tor on previously after you create your usb just for a added layer of comfort.

				Why do people assume by using someone else&#039;s internet via their unsecured wireless is a good idea? For all you know they might be a Computer Forensics expert who loves to fuck with freeloaders in his spare time.

You can&#039;t brute force AES 128/256, without getting extremely lucky, like shake a jar create a universe lucky...<br />

				Both you guys&nbsp; are correct&nbsp; in some ways. I have to lean towards eeee&#039;s&nbsp; thoughts on this matter though. There is nothing that can&#039;t be decrypted and yes no one is safe here. All we can do is take all the precautions we can and pray to whatever god it is we worship and hope we&nbsp; can enjoy our goods without having to spend yrs in a cage. Odds are most of us here are good honest decent&nbsp; people who just enjoy getting a buzz and relaxing. The law&nbsp; said booze was against the law at one time. To law enforcement who may be reading this. Do you really think we are all&nbsp; bad people who are pieces of shit that need to be locked in a cage and taken from our kids and family and friends just because want and in many cases need a chemical to make us happy or to relax us? and you look at us like that and think these things cause a piece of paper says its&nbsp; wrong? but if that peice of people got changed cause some CROOKS in Washington (the politicians AKA the real crooks and pieces of shit that lie and care about themselves only) said all the sudden it was ok to use drugs just like they did with prohibition on booze&nbsp; you would change your mind about us? I highly doubt you look at ppl in a bar sippin&nbsp; jim beam as pieces of shit do you? take second to sit back&nbsp; and reflect on what is truly right and what is truly wrong morally

				Nobody can decrypt AES or Twofish or any other modern cipher that&#039;s using a password with high entropy and has been properly implemented to avoid side channel attacks.

				mdamail no disrespect intended so please don&#039;t take this comment the wrong way but the&nbsp; word &quot;impossible&quot; is found only in the dictionary of fools. I assure you it can be.Easy to do? A task that some one&nbsp; would invite upon themselves? Hell no..not even the best of hackers would want to attempt it. But yes it can happen. We can agree to disagree though. I have been waiting for a response from support&nbsp; for 24 hrs now guys. Does it normally take this long?
