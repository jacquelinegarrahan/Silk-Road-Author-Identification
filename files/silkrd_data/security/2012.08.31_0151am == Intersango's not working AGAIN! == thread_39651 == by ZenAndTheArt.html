				I know most of you have already given up on Intersango. But, seeing as Vlad turned scammer, I thought there maybe a few people left who are willing to use Intersango in their last days at Metro Bank. So this is a warning to those thinking of making any £ (GBP) deposits into Intersango&#039;s account at Metro Bank. <br /><br />This is the message they&#039;ve put up on their support page; &quot;UPDATE 2012-08-30 Unfortunately due to a technical error with Metro&#039;s online banking system we are now locked out of the account. This appears to be identical to problems we have had in the past with Metro banks online banking. Unfortunately in the past it took several days for Metro to provide us with a workaround.&quot;<br /><br />How many times has this happened at Intersango now? &gt;:(<br /><br />

				<br />Hi,<br />I didn&#039;t read the update info and sent them £100 yesterday around 3pm. I am depressed. My bad luck is gigantic :((<br />My only question is, what to do now, do I get back my money?<br />And maybe a second question, is there anything similar to intersango, but safer.

				I send them a bit of money before this new announcement came up, and it still hasn&#039;t showed. I mean obviously they don&#039;t have access to the account so they can&#039;t process the payment but what now? Is there anybody who can shed light on whether or not people will see their money i.e those who have been through this with intersango before?

				If you were happy using intersango as far as using your bank account goes then try Mtgox. Works much the same just takes couple of business days to show deposits rather than the couple hours when intersango worked. As far as getting your money from intersango , well, who the fuck knows? We all did eventually last time but that&#039;s no guarantee this time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TBH if I had been going to use intersango again ( which I did recently due to convenience) i would a) have read support info carefully and b) sent a small test payment first to see if all was well. I appreciate this doesnt help any of you who now have limbo money, but hey, you live and learn.<br /><br />I am interested in bitcoin OTC which puts buyers and sellers together directly. I&#039;m investigating it at moment but it&#039;s a bit daunting to the noob. I wonder if anyone who uses this service has the time to post a bit of info on how to use this site. Or if it&#039;s already been covered point me to the thread? Thanks

				Anybody got a realistic alternative for UK bitcoin customers?&nbsp; <br /><br />I just had a look and registered at Mt Gox but it isn&#039;t anything like as user friendly as Intersango, there are quite a few possible charges and no plain instructions how to withdraw money for UK customers. I believe we can use Barclays bank for deposits, but for withdrawals it seems much more difficult. A wire transfer from a bank in Poland if I understand their instructions correctly?<br /><br />Also according to their website: &quot;Wire transfers are currently taking up to 1 week to process due to the volume of withdrawal requests in queue.&nbsp; If your withdrawal is larger than 10,000 USD, it will take at least 2 weeks to process.&quot;<br /><br />Anyone from the UK use Mt Gox to sell bitcoin and make UK bank deposits? :)

				It&#039;s very strange that both intersango and mtgox have something to do with Polish banking system. I have an account in Poland, but all this operations is little bit pain in the arse, because if you want to get your money back to the UK again, you have to use regular transfer from the polish account which is quite expensive, or Moneybookers or whatever, and all this is connected to money exchange rate PLN/GBP and additional fees for Moneybookers for example.

				This is what I received a minute ago from the&nbsp; Intersango team.<br />I am very upset now, could anyone explain me briefly did I lost my money or not...?<br /><br />&quot;Hello,<br /><br />We apologize for the recent issues with UK payments. We are experiencing the same technical glitch we encountered before which is on our bank&#039;s end. We understand that this is inconvenient and we share your frustration. We do not expect the issue to be resolved before our account is closed.<br /><br />UK Deposists are currently unable to be automatically imported, and must be manually entered from paper statements. Payments into the account however will be reflected once we are able to manually import them.<br /><br />Until further notice, all UK Withdrawals with a status of &quot;Requested&quot; will have to wait for our new UK payment gateway.<br /><br />We expect to have everything sorted out in the near future. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br /><br />Chris<br />Team Intersango&quot;

				Looks like it might be a while until we see our money, or if we see it at all. He says &#039;we do not expect the issue to be resolved before our account is closed&#039;...so how the hell are intersango supposed to know whose payed money into metro bank after this all gets sorted then? Luckily I&#039;ve only lost a small amount but I really feel for those who have a lot more in limbo.
