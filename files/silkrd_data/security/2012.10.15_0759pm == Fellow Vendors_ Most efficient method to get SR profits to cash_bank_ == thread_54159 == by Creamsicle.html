				I have been vending here for a few months and going to need to start regularly getting my SR profits out from my SR account to either cash or my bank account. I have done much reading over the months that I have been here and really don&#039;t see any efficient method for safely getting money from SR to usable cash or a bank account. I purchased a Walmart Moneycard (with cash of course) in hopes that it may be an option but then realized they want a SSN# to register the card, so I don&#039;t know a way around that.<br /><br />What methods do you use, you could PM me if you like. I know there are exchangers but from what I remember they are ridiculously expensive. I have actually never cashed out, only deposited money (via Bitinstant). I use bitsintant to anonymously make bank deposits, and they are great. But it doesn&#039;t seem there is such an easy option for getting coin out. So I am all ears on the most affordable/safest/most efficient methods.

				You&#039;re unlikely to get a response as this information is kept pretty close to the belt.<br /><br />It is worth noting that there are several vendors who will cash other vendors out using escrow for as low as 25% (on $1000 or more). It sounds high but, objectively, 25% is a pretty damn good rate to receive clean cash in the mail. Out of the escrow system, I&#039;ve seen as low as 2%... but huge amounts of trust are required here on your end.<br /><br />There are a variety of other methods... just something you&#039;re going to have to really think about and put time into finding the right solution for you. <br />.Hades.

				This is a main reason I have not put much thought into vending.&nbsp; I can buy coins easy enough and can turn drugs in the mail to cash in real life transactions, but that limits some options for me.&nbsp; I am curious as to this as well.

I should have taken this in to account before investing the amount of money I have in the past two days in getting ready to start providing two new products. To make it worth your while I will send you some BTC (whatever you think is fair) if you are an established vendor, or even an established user on this forum.

				I&#039;m honestly not trolling you. Just trying to be honest. That &#039;fair price&#039; you speak of for a vendor to reveal their methods is, in all likelihood, much more than you&#039;re willing to pay. Giving such info could potentially compromise an operation. Shipping logistics and the money end are the weak points to vending here. Much thought and care has to be put into both.<br /><br />Also, as I mentioned before, you could use the cash out vendors in the &#039;Money&#039; section of SR until you have established another means. I&#039;ll reiterate that 25% is, objectively, a decent rate for such services. Alternatively, there is SRdn666&#039;s listing for an &#039;Anonymous Account&#039; for $711USD (listed here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/ecad651d55). It&#039;s not clear if anyone has successfully gotten what they paid for... but you could ask questions.<br />.Hades.<br />

				Go the money section on SR and start a dialogue with vendors who sell money related products I am sure they would be more than happy to work with you to keep their BTC stocked up.

				You are doing the right thing - asking and trying to learn, but you wouldn&#039;t reveal to me where and how you but the products you want to sell on SR, would you? (PM me if that is a &quot;yes&quot;) So vendors are not going to tell you their trade secrets either.<br /><br />I have personally spent the last month working on the very same issue and even spent more than a thousand dollars and I still have no definitive answers.<br /><br />I would advise learning identity theft or making smaller and ore frequent cash out amounts.<br /><br />Shoot me a PM and when I figure it all out I will tell you what to do but it will cost you $3,000 - $5,000<br /><br />Modzi

				I am SURPRISED that there isnt a SL ATM company currently running. I would be willing to run one if there is enough interest. BTC &gt; Cash or Cash &gt; BTC. Most likely with a cheaper % rake than currently available that would come down if I am able to get enough regular business to hire staff. PM me with any interest. I could do some one offs for now.

				May I ask who you are? You have a buyer account on SR and 5 posts here... Sorry for being skeptical, but money laundering (or.. even cashing out large amounts of bitcoin for a &#039;low&#039; rate) isn&#039;t exactly the easiest thing on the planet to do... hence why this thread exists.<br /><br />Would be nice to have a little background before anyone is going to take an offer such as this seriously (I hope, anyway... but, you know...).<br />.Hades.

				Don&#039;t get it twisted... I don&#039;t WANT to know you either. Know another thing I don&#039;t WANT? Someone with no reputation (and, now, an unwillingness to provide any background info) touting services that, while desirable, are by no means child&#039;s play. I read a post earlier today about an individual who had obviously been around the forums for a while (600+ posts) getting scammed by the &#039;www.bitkoin.com&#039; jokers. While that doesn&#039;t really say much about this specific individual, it does show that seemingly desirable services will catch a few fish when the net is cast big enough.<br /><br />This is the second thread you&#039;ve offered such service in. I would hope that no other vendor would considering doing business with you unless you MINIMALLY answered the questions I have presented. But to each their own...<br />.Hades.
