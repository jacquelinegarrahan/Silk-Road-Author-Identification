				As I&#039;m generating my key in GnuPA, the instructions say something like, &quot;this may take a while, even if you have a fast computer.&quot; However, it didn&#039;t take any time at all. In fact, by the time I had typed and re-typed a password, the keys were generated. Did I do something wrong? Is my encryption weak? The key does look just like everybody else&#039;s. It also said something about moving the mouse around, opening files, etc. while generating the key; how are you supposed to do this while typing in a password? Do you do this before you start typing the password?<br /><br />Also, encrypting a message to myself doesn&#039;t take any time either, nor does decrypting it. I&#039;m just concerned because I was under the impression that all of these things took some time. <br /><br />Thanks for your help.

				Lol. You&#039;re all set up bro. No worries.<br /><br />Not sure how many characters are in your pw, but the more the better, and it probably gives that warning because of the potential to put a 1000+ character or more pw in. <br /><br />As far as moving the mouse goes, you are supposed to do it as you are typing in your pw. For example if your pw is SILKROADISTHESHIT you would type in SILK then move the mouse around, then type ROAD move it around again, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />
