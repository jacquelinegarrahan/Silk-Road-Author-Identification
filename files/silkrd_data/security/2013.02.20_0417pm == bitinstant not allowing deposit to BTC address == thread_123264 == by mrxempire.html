				I&#039;m assuming this has something to do with the problems everyones been having with bitinstant within the last couple of days (including me). The option to deposit BTC to a bitcoin address no longer shows up on the bitinstant page. Does anyone know when this option will be back up? I need some more BTC. Is there any other site I can buy more bitcoins from that follows the same steps as bitinstant? (filling out a moneygram slip, then going to a CVS or supermarket to go pay?) thats the only way I really know how to do it. Sorry if this issue has been addressed elsewhere,&nbsp; but there is about 30 pages of spam on this page. I dont wanna filter through that whole mess. Ain&#039;t nobody got time for that!

				The problems aren&#039;t on Bitinstant&#039;s side. Coinapult, the exchange that bitinstant uses to do BTC-email and direct deposit to BTC address is down. Until they are back up you must use another exchange like Mt.Gox or Bitstamp. I prefer Bitstamp as they have no deposit/withdrawl limit and do not require AML/KYC documents like Mt.Gox does.

				Give bitinstant some time.&nbsp; They&#039;re a reliable company, and their CEO is a stand-up guy.&nbsp; They&#039;ll get it fixed.&nbsp; (+1 to you, shutdem)<br /><br />I also want to give some props to bitfloor.&nbsp; I set up a $40 deposit today, the fee was $1.84, I deposited it at a Bank of America, and an hour later I have $40 in my account.&nbsp; Now, I can trade USD for BTC at my leisure, and easily transfer to SR.&nbsp; Definitely a superior competitor to Mt. Gox.&nbsp; All you need to get a bitfloor account is an email address, and you don&#039;t need an account at the bank.&nbsp; You do check a box when you set up the deposit that you&#039;re willing to show a govt. ID at the bank, but I wasn&#039;t asked for mine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m a fan.<br /><br />Bitstamp is fine, but unless I&#039;m reading it wrong, it&#039;s insanely expensive unless you&#039;re in Europe.&nbsp; Looks like a $15 for transfers from US banks.

				Bitstamp was super easy to set up. Ridiculously so. I&#039;m in the US, and it was cheap to transfer the btc, too - only a 0.5% charge. I was charged less than $2 by bitstamp. Usual charges with wiring the money, though, like with bitinstant.

				thank you! it seems simple even though that bit instant has btc to email back up. but its 1% cheaper to use bitstamp! So i am stuck between which one to use. I think i might do $50 bucks with each and see what gets me more coins and then go back and get the rest after i see, plus i just heard about bitstamp but must be legit it bitinstant funds them<br /><br />desicions....<br />ANY THOUGHTS

Bitinstant still sets it up for you, but instead of directing the money to BITCOIN ADDRESS, you direct it to YOUR BITSTAMP ID NUMBER. you have to have a bitstamp account, though (with the fake info you just used for your moneygram thing). This step will take 4% from you, the normal bitinstant fee + 3.95 for moneygram.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve done the whole moneygram thing at walmart or whatever, you have money in your bitstamp account. Use that money to buy coins. This step has no fees.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve bought bitcoins on your bitstamp account, you can send them directly to your bitcoin address - this step only has a 0.5% fee.<br /><br /><br />Sucks for those of yall waiting for btc&#039;s to come through quick. USD were in my bitstamp acct as soon as I got back from wiring the money by moneygram. When I logged into bitstamp and clicked the link to buy bitcoins with my USD, that shit happened almost immediately. I then withdrew the BTC to SR BTC address, and that shit happened in less than 30 mins. Guess I was just lucky.

				yeah, but you can&#039;t do a cash deposit to a bitstamp account number anymore. Bitinstant isn;t letting you do it. The option doesn&#039;t show up anymore, the only options for cash deposit are mtgox, paypal,vouchx, or virwox. I heard mtgox requires that you provide actual identification when you use it, so im trying to veer away from using that site. Has anyone ever used ziggap.com? Someone on bitcointalk.org brought it up as an alternative to bitinstant, and it seems easy to use, but is it possible that its a scam site? i&#039;ve only used bitinstant before so im nervous about using a different site

				I just successfully used Ziggap with a cash Chase Bank deposit -&gt; BTC address.&nbsp; <br /><br />From cash deposit to coins in wallet took a little under 4 hours.&nbsp; I have only seen ziggap mentioned in a few threads and I took a chance with them.<br /><br />I emailed support with questions twice and I got VERY quick responses.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t think these guys are a scam.<br /><br />Hope this helps for people that don&#039;t have BofA&#039;s around them like I do, and I may just start using ziggap from now on due to bitinstants broken service and non existant communication.<br /><br />

				from bitinstant blog<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s back! Receive your order directly to your Bitcoin address.<br />AuthorBitInstant Posted on DateFriday, March 15, 2013 at 8:50PM<br /><br />Dear Bitcoin Community,<br /><br />Thank you for bearing with us over the past couple weeks, they’ve been rough.<br /><br />On one side, we were dealing with the technical and PR ramifications of the hack that occurred, and on the other side we were upgrading core components in the system which enables us to send Bitcoin orders directly to Bitcoin addresses and email addresses (Coinapult).<br /><br />For those interested, much of this work involved switching Coinapult to Electrum and updating API calls. We also had to fix bugs originating with MtGox’s API which became exponentially more problematic as volume exploded from recent buying interest. Our system was dropping orders due to “odd data” coming from the API calls throughout.<br /><br />In any case, during this process, many customer orders were not processed promptly by us, and this is entirely our fault. Growing pains are inevitable, but it’s still not acceptable for our customers to be affected by them.<br /><br />We apologize sincerely for such delays over the past couple weeks, and for any orders or emails that went unanswered during that time.<br /><br />To remedy this, for any orders which failed or did not process due to bugs on our end, we will honor the BTC exchange rate at the time of your purchase (bad for us, good for you, since the price has increased significantly).<br /><br />We are also waiving/returning any fees associated with those orders.<br /><br />And fortunately, as you may have noticed, our Bitcoin payout option is back! Yes, we’re excited also. You can now once again place cash deposit orders and receive the Bitcoins directly without having to deal with any exchange.

I&#039;ve been seeing everyone recently talking abt bitinstant being back to normal and I won&#039;t lie it&#039;s amazing to be able to cut out the middle process of transferring from one wallet to another, but I hear abt bit stamp and wonder if there is a way to do the same with them?

				a good alternative to bitinstant is bitfloor. I used it when bitinstant went down last month. All you need to do is go to a bank of america and fill out an out of state deposit slip. They didn&#039;t ask me for my i.d, and they charge a little less in fees compared to bitinstant. bitinstant is back up and running tho, so i usually alternate between the two
