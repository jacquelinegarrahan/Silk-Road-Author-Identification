				Two instances of Tor.<br /><br />Tor one is hidden service, Tor two is normal client. Tor one Torrc uses Tor one as socks proxy.

If they do active DOS attacks against the set of nodes that make up the possible selections for T1 entry they may be able to own T1 entry. Of course the feds can simply subpoena one of the nodes that is T1 entry and get the information for the node behind it, which if you use a normal hidden service configuration will be the hidden server itself. But now they merely obtain T2 exit, and furthermore they can not continue to do the force the hidden service to open a billion circuits to traceback attack because T2 is a normal Tor client circuit. Configure T1 and T2 Torrc appropriately to make sure there is not node reuse (or family reuse?) between the instances of Tor.<br /><br />Latency is doubled, but it should probably prevent the feds from being able to trace hidden services. Right now they either can, or the only thing stopping them is their own stupidity. Will add donation link to my signature sometime ;).

				I&#039;ve been meditating lately on how to make tor hidden services more hidden.&nbsp; As it stands now it seems relatively easy to de-anonymize a server through traffic analysis, modulating patterns on both endpoints, etc.&nbsp; For any serious long-term cloaking I think you would need a long daisy-chain of servers from different datacenters in various parts of the world, and a regular scheduling of rolling to the next IP, leaving the old ones forever.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll keep saying it.. we can run faster scared than they can angry.&nbsp; I think the next step in the evolution of anonymity is a cloud-based network of anonymous, donated VPSs that anybody can set up (think a VirtualBox appliance spread around via torrent) and each one runs a small fragment of the overall operation with massive redundancy across the board.&nbsp; Latency goes up, not to mention all the other technical challenges, but this seems like a wise medium-term goal.

				Great post! <br /><br />IMHO, LE can probably trace any hidden service if they make a single, coordinated effort.

I have not done an in depth analysis of the anonymity properties, but the only problem I can imagine would be if T1 and T2 re-use nodes between them. Even that wouldn&#039;t be horrible for a hidden service, considering the entry guard can already trivially determine if it is an entry guard for any given hidden service. You might not even need to protect from node reuse for hidden services, although if you were a normal client it would be important to do so because you would definitely not want to reuse the same node for entry and exit in that case. I would bet five hundred bucks that configuring a hidden service to use two instances of Tor in this way would extremely increase the anonymity provided. As it stands today, tracing hidden services is trivial. You can trace to each of a hidden services entry guards in under a minute, and then it is just a matter of either forcing it to change to new entry guards until it picks one of yours, or if you are a stronger attacker simply sending a court order to one of the entry guards or its infrastructure. A hidden service with an entry guard in USA could realistically be deanonymized in a couple of hours if the feds had a fucking clue. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IMHO, LE can probably trace any hidden service if they make a single, coordinated effort.

In that case, I&#039;m guessing they&#039;d have to generate a new URL every time the server is moved in order to distance the new server from the old.<br /><br />In any case, you can always move the server, rotate the entry guards manually (if that&#039;s even possible), AND have the hidden service run through an additional tor client set to avoid node reuse. Also, is there some kind of parameter in the torrc that allows you to increase the amount of nodes in a circuit past 3-4?

				Jondonym is a fine VPN and you will not likely find much better, they cooperate immediately with court orders but prior to a court order requesting logs to a specific site or from a specific user they do not log anything. Also the court orders need to be carried out against individual nodes, which are in different jurisdictions. Of course such a small network is much easier for a passive attacker to pwn though.<br /><br />You can make Tor circuits up to 8 nodes there are network limits that prevent you from extending past that though, although there is little point in using additional nodes. The goal of the scheme I show in the OP is not to add additional nodes but rather to gain the anonymity benefits of Tor running as a non hidden service client for Tor hidden services. <br /><br />Actually come to think of it, I believe Tor automatically rotates entry guards if it detects that your IP address has changed, so as long as they are not using strict entry guards in their Torrc Tor would take care of the details of changing entry guards when the the servers location changes for them.

				Gotcha. You don&#039;t need too many nodes per circuit, more important are the other benefits to running the hidden service through a client, such as preventing that build-lots-of-circuits-to-find-entry-guards attack you mentioned. Not sure about hidden services, but the client always rotates entry guards if you aren&#039;t using a bridge. I know that&#039;s obvious -- I just hope the hidden service does the same after a while.

				No one has publicly demonstrated their ability to do so, but it&#039;s certainly feasible when the attacker has essentially all the resources in the world. Obviously side channel attacks are the way to go in these cases, so it may simply be a matter of time until they either discover a major vulnerability, get damning evidence from a CI, or get tired of trying and just attack the tor network itself. Or there may not be enough pressure to go after SR itself, and LE will concentrate on busting the low hanging fruit, i.e. vendors and users who fuck up. Even if they took down this site, others will pop up in its place as long as bitcoins can be freely traded. Perhaps financial regulation will be their weapon of choice.

That solves the issue if the attacker is able to add two nodes to the Tor network, but doesn&#039;t do shit to protect from attackers who can simultaneously DDOS selected entry guards until they own one of the targets, or even easier simply send a court order to one of the identified entry guards or its infrastructure. If the guard is in USA they don&#039;t even need a warrant to do a trap and trace on it and then they can identify the hidden service from that. At the very best a normally configured hidden service is as anonymous as its least secure entry guard is from being hacked, at worst it is as anonymous as someone tracing to its entry guards in a minute and then using a trap and trace on one of them.

Any tips on where to start reading to gain an understanding of how all this works and at least understand what everyone is talking about :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The attack against hidden services is pretty straightforward. Hidden services open new circuits (three nodes, entry -&gt; middle -&gt; final) for every client connection request. The entry guard is from a small selection of nodes (generally three), but the middle and final node are selected from the entire pool of Tor nodes. An attacker who wants to trace a hidden service can add a relay node to the network and then (even from the same relay node...) use a specially modified client that sends tons of new connection requests to the hidden service and sends it a specially modulated stream of packets (watermarked, via deliberately created inter-packet timing characteristics). After doing this it immediately tears down the circuit, rinses and repeats. Now it only needs to wait until it detects this watermarked stream passing through it as a relay, and then it can observe the node it forwards this data onto. Since it sent the stream, it knows that it is a relay on the path to the hidden service, it can also select to use another node under its control as a rendezvous node so it can identify the hidden services final node and know if it is it, and by viewing where the watermarked traffic came from it can determine if it is the middle or entry guard for the hidden service. If it is the middle node it identifies the hidden services entry guard (one of the three anyway), if it is the entry guard it identifies the hidden service. <br /><br />After identifying the servers three entry guards (which takes all of a couple of seconds to minutes), there are a few things the attacker can do. Powerful attackers (passive / external) like the feds (assuming they are not complete fucking retards, which is asking for a pretty big assumption on your part, but humor me) would probably do one of two things: if any of the entry guards are located in the USA they can do warrantless trap and traces of the entry guard to determine the IP addresses of the servers it communicates with and when, and then they could do an end point timing correlation attack to deanonymize the hidden service. If all of the entry guards are outside of the USA they could use a mutual legal assistance treaty to accomplish the same thing, although they may be delayed by some period of time ranging from hours to maybe even months, depending on the location of the entry guards. However there is a tremendous chance that any given hidden service has at least one entry guard in either the USA or Germany, and normally entry guards rotate every month to two months so even if they are out of luck this month next month they will probably be in luck. <br /><br />Less powerful attackers (active / internal), like me, would be forced to try and get the hidden service to use one of our entry guards (since we can not do passive/external surveillance on the entry guards as easily as the feds can). The number one way to accomplish this is likely via a CPU exhaustion DOS. If the hidden services three entry guards can not manage its circuits, it will select new ones that can. If an attacker can do a sustained CPU exhaustion attack against all selected entry guards until one of its entry guards is selected, it can deanonymize the hidden service with an end to end timing attack after its entry guard is utilized. One way around this attack would be to select to use strict guard nodes in Torrc, then if the hidden services entry guards are DOSed the hidden service becomes unreachable, but at least it can not be forced into selecting new entry guards until it is deanonymized.<br /><br />The solution in OP works like this. There are two instances of Tor running on the hidden service server. One (HST) manages the hidden services circuits, the other (CT) is a normal instance of Tor running as a regular non-hidden service client. In the Torrc of HST, it is configured to use CT as a socks proxy. This results in a circuit that looks like this<br /><br />Hidden Server &lt;-&gt; CT entry &lt;-&gt; CT middle &lt;-&gt; CT Exit &lt;-&gt; HST Entry &lt;-&gt; HST middle &lt;-&gt; HST Final &lt;-&gt; Clients Final<br /><br />Now the malicious client can still force the hidden service to open an arbitrary number of HST circuits, and can do the previously mentioned attack to trace up to HST entry. However, if the weak active attack does sustained DOS against all selected HST entry nodes until they own one of them, they are only in a position to identify CT exit instead of the hidden server. Likewise, if the feds use a trap and trace or MLAT to passively spy on HST Entry, they are only in a position to identify CT exit, not the hidden server. Normal Tor clients that do not serve hidden services will not open a new circuit per request, rather they rotate circuits approximately once every ten minutes. Thus, the force the hidden service to open a billion new circuits to send watermarked traffic down them attack becomes infeasible to carry out, and the hidden service remains as anonymous as a regular Tor client. This is probably adequate to protect from non-retarded-fed level attackers (if such a mythical beast actually exists).

				This would also be very beneficial for clients, because if the feds can not locate the hidden service to put it under surveillance, they can not complete an end to end timing correlation attack against clients, even if they watch the clients sending and receiving traffic.<br /><br />some potential things to consider:<br /><br />1. The latency of the hidden service will be roughly doubled as the circuit from the hidden service is doubled <br /><br />2. There may be some anonymity problems with reusing nodes between the two instances of Tor, although I suspect this is less serious a concern for hidden services<br /><br />3. There may be a fingerprint left in client entry return traffic as the response time after sending traffic will be uncharacteristically high, although cover traffic going down the same circuit should muddy this, and it really beats having a hidden service that can be traced in a day and then watched passively to complete 50% of an end to end timing correlation attack.

Adam Smith wrote a good deal on that subject, it&#039;s a pity few people actually read him. I think it&#039;s strongly related to the urge to explore (sadly limited to our little blue orb for now) and even paternalistic &#039;protectionist&#039; instincts, I think that&#039;s why so many 40/50 somethings suddenly develop an overwhelming interest in abstract concepts like climate change, local politics, or an obsessive desire to obtain elaborate methods of transport.

I&#039;m sure someone out there can write a function to dynamically relocate the server based on triggers that would indicate an attempt to compromise tor, although the gov&#039;t could use this to DoS the hidden service.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a pragmatic world it should be a perfectly reasonable CV to submit, I mean the operational/technical abilities of a professional criminal/hacker + the correct kind of intuition/paranoia you develop with experience is pretty much the exact recipe required for the best intelligence operatives/spooks.

But yeah, that&#039;s human nature. Very few people are still doing at 80 what they set out to do at 25, or even 45. Priorities change when you realize what is most important to you.

				greetings<br /><br />does the hidden service need to be created under Tor One&#039;s if so theres a target and virtual port ?!<br />does the term hidden service refer to tunnelling Tor Two&#039;s traffic thru Tor One by specifying Tor One&#039;s listening address in Tor Two&#039;s Proxy setting?<br /><br /><br />help needed thanks<br />
