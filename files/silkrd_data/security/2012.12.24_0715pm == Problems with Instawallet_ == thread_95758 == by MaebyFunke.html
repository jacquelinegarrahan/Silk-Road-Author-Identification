				I am having an issue today with my funds not showing up in my Instawallet, even though the transaction went through fine and the blockchain shows 11 confirmations. I did a cash deposit using Bitinstant as usual, and had the funds deposited into the instawallet I always use. Usually the funds are there right away, but its been 2 hours now and there is nothing in my instawallet.&nbsp; I talked to bitinstant and they said that since the blockchain shows that it went through correctly, it is an issue with instawallet crediting me. All instawallet has for support is an email, and I already emailed them. Has anyone had this happen to them before? Is there anything else I can do?

				I should add that now the blockchain shows 15 confirmations, yet there are still no bitcoins in my instawallet. It says on the blockchain that the coins are in my wallet, but the wallet still says 0 BTC whenever I go to it. I&#039;ve triple checked all the addresses and info, and everything is correct. Why wouldn&#039;t instawallet be showing me my BTC? Anyone ever had this happen before? Their support still hasn&#039;t responded to me (and with the holidays, who know how long that will take).

				It&#039;s not just you...<br /><br />5.5 hours so far and no credit in instawallet... Confirmations is at 26...<br /><br />From what I have read they had a similar issue a little while back.&nbsp; Their bitcoin client crashed and when back up it took a while for everything to get processed...

				WEWH am I glad I found this thread. I&#039;m bugging out over here because my bitcoins haven&#039;t shown up in my instawallet either, which they usually do literally in 1 second when sent from MT.GOX. Hopefully we&#039;ll all be receiving our bitcoins soon. Let&#039;s all keep updated with each other. As in, let us know when you receive yours so we can know.

				I guess its a problem that is affecting all of instawallet then. Its been 6 hours for me so far and 26 confirmations here also. My blockchain shows that the btc are in my wallet but they still aren&#039;t showing up. Damn, I wish I had just sent my btc right to SR! I was hoping to get an order in today so that I could have something by the end of the week, but it looks like that wont be happening. At least I&#039;m not the only one. I&#039;ll keep you guys updated.

				I had a problem on Sunday.&nbsp; I used &quot;http://www.websitenotworking.com&quot; and verified the site was down for a couple of hours.&nbsp; The entire process took my about 4+ hours to complete a mix.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Merry Xmas!<br />PG

				Yup. was able to make my orders today. Unfortunately, the odds of the Charlie and OC&#039;s I ordered making it here by new years are pretty slim, but there&#039;s always hope :) If not, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s stuff to be found where I&#039;m going. I just love getting my stuff from SR now... Getting from anywhere else seems weird/sketchy. There&#039;s no accountability on the streets.
