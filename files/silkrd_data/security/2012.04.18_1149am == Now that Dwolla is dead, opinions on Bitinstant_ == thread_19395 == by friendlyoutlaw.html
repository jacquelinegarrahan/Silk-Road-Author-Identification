				Dwolla now requires a SSN and a facebook account in order to send money to MtGox, thus it&#039;s no longer something that you can (easily) do at arm&#039;s length (whereas before if you had a bank account that wasn&#039;t in your name, you could).<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking the best approach now is cash deposit -&gt; Bitinstant -&gt; Mtgox.<br /><br />Opinions?

				Yeah, after further investigation I decided to say &quot;screw MtGox&quot; and just use bitinstant&#039;s cash deposit-&gt;bitcoins method.<br /><br />5% is a hefty percentage compared to the .5% I was paying to do Dwolla-&gt;MtGox...but this way I don&#039;t have to wait a goddamn week for a transfer to clear to Dwolla, and it&#039;s more secure.<br /><br />Besides, the drugs I have access to in local F2F are significantly less expensive on SR, so it&#039;s stupid to get too caught up in pinching pennies.

				Honestly, every single time (about 20 different occasions) I have gotten my BTC to SR using this method, and it has always worked:<br /><br />bitinstant --&gt;&gt; cash deposit (switch up banks/branches constantly. also, make it for weird amount so it seems like you&#039;re paying a bill or something) --&gt;&gt; email from bitinstant with MtGox redemption code (although, now they have made it so you bypass this step-not sure how I feel about that) --&gt;&gt; trade for BTC on MtGox --&gt;&gt; send to your BTC wallet --&gt;&gt; send to SR (although, I&#039;ve been getting a little cocky lately and go MtGox--&gt;&gt; SR...still works!). <br /><br />To me this method is so simple. And its the best because you&#039;re dealing first in cash, and then w/online accounts you need not include personal info with. From cash deposit at the bank to BTC on my SR account time is like 2 hrs (but that&#039;s sending from MtGox directly - its probably better to send to your BTC Wallet and then SR). I plan (and hope I won&#039;t have to for any reason) on employing this same method for all my BTC transactions.

				Quick questions about the bitinstant --&gt; Coinapult method<br /><br />1. Can you use a tormail address with both of these services? This would be great news as using a real email to buy coins kind of rustles my jimmies<br /><br />2. Can someone walk me through the process? Do I just fill out the bitinstant form as normal except select coinapult and provide my tormail address instead of selecting Mt.Gox and giving my account number? After that I go and make my deposit as normal and when I get home I should have a link in my tormail which will allow me to send coins to an instawallet --&gt; SR?

I don&#039;t think you can. Not sure though. But using a reg. e-mail is fine dude. I&#039;d bet it&#039;s far more easy for LE to get the video of you depositing the cash than getting into your e-mail, figuring out your personal IP from that. Even then, big deal they proved you bought some coin.<br /><br />2. Place order on bitinstant, print out slip, deposit cash, wait for mt.gox to buy your btc(don&#039;t access from tor), send the btc then to a instawallet, send through a few more instawallets, send to SR.<br /><br />edit- my bad didn&#039;t read your post thoroughly. But ^^^ works 100% fine for me, if you wanna give it a try.

				Ive been using the bitinstant deposit cash to bank and then to the email method. Its real quick and easy, within 15 minutes to half hour the funds will be in the email of choice. after you get the email, there&#039;s a link with your funds as bitcoins. the link will lead you to the coinapult website, when you click on the link you have the option to put funds in a wallet or send funds to a bitcoin address of choice.To deposit the cash, go to any of the four banks that trust cash has an account with. bitinstant and trust cash joined forces to make everything happen conveniently. what i do is copy the invoice that was created on bitinstant&quot;s website. all you will need is the trust cash account # , trust cash routing # and the exact amount including fees that was created on the website. fill out a deposit slip or go to the teller and give her the info. the only down fall is the fee that is charged. i made the deposit at 3 something today, took my time and its 5 on the east coast and its already on SR real quick. One thing i still noticed was that the funds still go through mtgox.

				Bitinstant is fast. Cash to BTC in ~20 minutes, IME. <br /><br />Tips: Some banks don&#039;t care about the sheet- you need to fill out a deposit slip. Only banking info that doesn&#039;t fit into the bank&#039;s deposit slip is the routing number, but I asked the first time, and the teller said that the routing number wasn&#039;t needed, since it was the same bank. <br /><br />Now, I just fill out the deposit slip on arrival (Trustcash company name, address, bank account number, deposit amount) and hand it over to the teller with the cash, get a receipt (just in case), and by the time I&#039;m home my exchange account is funded and I&#039;m good to go :)
