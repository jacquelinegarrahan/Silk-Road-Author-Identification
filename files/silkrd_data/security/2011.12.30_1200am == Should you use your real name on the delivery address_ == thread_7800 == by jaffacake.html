				This might sound like a stupid question but it doesn&#039;t hurt to ask. I&#039;m just thinking if your package does get seized and somebody comes knocking, if a fake name is on the package you can just play dumb and say that person doesn&#039;t live here and you don&#039;t know anybody by that name.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				It depends. In some places on the globe all packages must be signed by receiver.<br /><br />If You can use fake name to receive the package, good, use the fake name. The SR guide for buyers suggests how to check will this work, You must read the guide by yourself.<br /><br />And You always should play dumb, you did not request the package and have no idea what is going on.

Just claim you never ordered it and someone is trying to frame you. Heh.<br /><br />I doubt having a fake name would convince LE you&#039;re an innocent party. It might even look more suspicious and less plausible than the above suggestion.<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert on the law and how these situations work with cops and drugs, but I have had my collar felt once by Customs for importing contraband once, and I can tell you their priority is to get an admission from you in the first instance, and if they can&#039;t do that, they will hold you and get a warrant and turn over your place with a fine tooth comb, especially your PC for any evidence. <br /><br />Although they can technically prosecute you just for having a package with drugs in going to your address, its far better for them to be sure of a conviction if they have evidence you ordered it to back it up. Else you can stand in court plead innocent say you never ordered it and say someone has done it out of spite and you&#039;ve been framed, you have many enemies etc. <br /><br />Unless you&#039;re talking about a big quantity or class A its unlikely to even go to court, the cops will most likely just caution you, maybe issue an out of court fixed penalty fine. Depends which country you&#039;re in and what drugs. <br /><br />If in doubt, don&#039;t order from overseas and take the risk of being in this situation surely is the best solution. Stick to domestic vendors.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				They can prosecute you for anything, even just breathing. But the point is that if you shut the fuck up a jury will not convict if their case sucks. If you received drugs in the mail then you are prosecuted for it just take it to trial and deny the entire time. The evidence is limited and it is certainly not beyond a reasonable doubt IF all they have is proof that a package of drugs was sent to your legal address in your legal name. However, if you admit anything its likely that unless you have a jury comprised of recreational drug users that you will be convicted. So please remember no matter what happens just shut the fuck up and plea not guilty and then allow them to prove their case. The feds especially hate losing cases which is why&nbsp; they don&#039;t prosecute when you import drugs. Cases like that are hard to win unless the defendant admits guilt or their is other evidence aside from the package containing drugs.<br /><br />FUCK THE POLICE FUCK EM. <br /><br />&#039;THE SARGENT ON THE NARCOTICS SQUAD IS CROOKED. HE FOUND MY BLOODY MONEY AND HE TOOK IT.&quot;

				Exactly what Bigflake said, some people often forget that any evidence collected by LE can not be used as exculpatory evidence (i.e. in your defense) so do NOT make their jobs any easier. We all have to work hard for our paychecks, so can they and I have my own job to do which doesn&#039;t include doing theirs for them.

				Be smart about what you do and prepare for the worst case scenario ahead of time.
