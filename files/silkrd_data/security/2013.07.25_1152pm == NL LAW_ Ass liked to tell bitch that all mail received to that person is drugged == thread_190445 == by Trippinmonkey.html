				So, there once was this fucking jerk.<br />He accused people of using drugs they never even touched.<br /><br />Because he did so, the woman who gets all the mail out of a mailbox at str nmbr with the letter with str nbr and (sub)room.<br /><br />Me thinks that the woman has no rights at all to open up ANY mail not addressed to her...<br />She opened the first package, declined it and said it has not arrived. While the mailingman agrees with the delivery.<br />She got rid of the nondrug profit.<br />All next days she opens all that persons mail. With or without drugs.<br /><br />If there are drugs in it, there is a huge problem for getting the drugs or money back and even to be kicked out of the big appartement because of being annoying?<br /><br />Logical thinking lead to this conslusion: A random guy told her crap. Then she opened mail not addressed to her, which in NL is a federal occur. <br />But how to prove where she put it?<br /><br />And does it matter if a buyer then neglects knowing exactly what would be in the letters because it would be a surprise?<br /><br />Yes ordering drugs is really really blah bad...<br /><br />But opening somebody elses mail is also totally not allowed.<br /><br />How to proceed with at the very best get all the gear back. It was a hige sale so as a buyer was lucky.<br />Can make more money with it.<br /><br />Or at least get the money back + be allowed to live here and not on the streets?

				you&#039;re in a bad position - you could mail yourself dummy packages with innocent material in them, report to the postal authorities that you&#039;ve been missing mail and one of your neighbors told you she was opening mail, would they watch. But, if they catch her, she&#039;ll tell them why, which will put you in a worse spot<br /><br />best bet - just move - no other choices i see

				personally, i&#039;d beat the living shit out of that cunt. but i understand that is not the way for everybody.<br />stop ordering drugs for a while, tell her that if she ever touches your mail again you&#039;ll send her the feds. if she says something about the drugs assure her that you don&#039;t have a problem with being on probation for a while and ask if it&#039;s the same for her when she thinks about the jailtime for a federal crime.<br /><br />and then move ASAP

				physical violence will result in you getting in more trouble.&nbsp; As she will just report you for both crimes.&nbsp; Having innocent packages go missing and reporting her may be the move if you can stay away from drugs and make your self clean.&nbsp; Decide if the end result of living in that spot and being rid of her is worth all that effort then act.&nbsp;

				A lot of advice so far.<br />I think that the dummy letters you post to yourself is the best option.<br />Try to catch her on camera and put her garbage- box/container up side down.<br /><br />You will be using gloves anyway doing that. Bring the opened envelope to the police.<br />They will find her dna and not yours.<br />Once convicted, she will be a criminal.<br />If she has a job she could lose it.<br /><br />Even if drugs were there, the evidence can not be used.<br />She can not go to the police.<br />The evidence is useless and she criminalized herself by unlawfully opening your mail.<br />(Briefgeheim geschonden)<br />That fact can be prosecuted, the receiving of the drugs not.<br /><br />The police has to have a court order to open your mail.<br />And if the secret service opens your mail, you will not notice it.<br />Even if you have closed the envelope with special glue, they will analyze the glue and remake it.<br />But it is not their job to get you for ordering drugs, their job is gathering information.<br /><br />Give the bitch a taste of her own medicine.<br />So you have to be the first and catch her mail and make it disappear.

				Ohh wow, This is a really tough one, For a start i would say dont beat the shit out her, You probably want to badly, but wheres it going to get you, probably into more fights with her family and friends, (even if you can kick their asses or youl just stab the shit out of them , where does it lead? To more trouble not getting your drugs back) <br />Play it smart. Heres what i would do.<br />Install a hidden camera pronto, Shouldent be too hard and lets say you buy it today and install it, Order packages as soon as it is installed, Cheap ones sure, but maybe something like cheap usb sticks or, an mp3 player, Something not worth a lot at all, but something she would be likely to pocket . <br />Hopefully in the days leading up to the packages arriving she will steal something else, And if not then hopefully she will go for your actual packages. <br />Make sure you capture her on video. When you do you have two ways to go about it.<br /><br />1.Approach her and inform her politely and calmly that opening other peoples mail is a federal crime, You want the money for the stuff and the packages or your going straight to the police. (whether this is a bluff or not is up to you) Be sincere and calm. If she starts saying go to the police, il just tell them about the stuff, Say who would believe you? Can you prove it? Il just tell the police your only saying that to 1. make it look better for yourself, Your clearly lying to get yourself off the hook. and 2. So that you can actually blame your drug stash on somebody else, Not only is she commiting a felony but shes trying to land HER drugs on you so you get blamed for it. <br />I reckon you would do well at this point even if she went to the police.<br /><br />2. Tell the police straight away, When they question her and yourself say she has been stealing your mail for months and you once caught her, You eventually got fed up because something worth the same amount as your package went missing and decided to install a hidden camera. You caught her and phone the Police.This way you get a police ticket for stolen property and could possibly claim it on insurance or something. <br /><br />Just think smart mate ;)<br />Hope this helps.<br />..HeatFireFlame..

				I&#039;ve thought about the hidden cam. But it has to be wireless with a bitch long ass range, and run on batteries.<br /><br />There are many cams on the roofs that she controls. Probably hacking those would be easier but I don&#039;t know how.<br /><br />The dummy mail sounds good.<br /><br />And if she did steal mail then I&#039;d want to punch the shit out of her. Worth $500+<br />She will not just throw it away in a trashcan. She&#039;s a pro in conning people.<br /><br />
