				I&#039;ve decided to start over with all my SR stuff, wipe drives etc now I have a better understanding of how everything works as far as encryption and other safeguards and buying BTC anonymously. While TOR is &#039;anonymous&#039; I&#039;d rather go the extra mile and use an internet connection that is no way connected to me either. Using public wifis seems like a bad idea though, not least because being sat with a laptop anywhere public on SR is not ideal.<br /><br />So, is there a way to have anonymous/untraceable mobile internet for a laptop? In the same way pre-paid phones allow anoymous phone useage? I see there as pay as you go type dongles but am not sure whether they are safe? Is there another way? <br /><br />Thanks.

				Starting over is always a good idea, I also do it frequently as I tumble upon new information and learn.<br />&nbsp;<br />I consider public or hacked WIFIs safe, as long as the MAC address is spoofed and Tor connecting to a Hidden Service. This setup hasn&#039;t been exploited with MITM before AFAIK, so the owner or pwner of the WLAN can&#039;t gain access to the data you send through his network.<br />You can use your laptop in your car hidden from the eyes of bystanders or even in your home, connecting to a nearby AP, although every method has it&#039;s drawbacks, and nothing is 100% safe.<br />There are also privacy filters for laptops or screens: http://www.thetravelinsider.info/2003/0131.htm<br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on pay-as-you-go dongles.

				Thanks for the reply. I had forgotten about MAC addresses, is it dodgy to research this on the clear net? I do worry whenever I am researching anything from BTC to PGP that it is all adding up somewhere and is giving away the game. Is it something that is done manually or are there tools for it?<br /><br />Hopefully someone else knows about payg dongles, if you can pay in cash then I&#039;m not sure how it could linked back to me but my knowledge of these things is (clearly) limited at the moment so I&#039;m not going to dive into anything before getting all the info I can.<br />

				This is somewhat relevant to pay-as-you-go, just run into this in an other thread, not sure if it&#039;s correct.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26776.msg290597#msg290597">Quote from: finbin on June 14, 2012, 06:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In europe we use prepaid net, Its a stick where you put a sim card and thats it.

At the very least you could install an extension like Google Sharing, it proxifies your google searches, but you will still leave a lot of tracks on your system, and ISP, so better to use an other search engine with Tor through a bridge, and a Live CD if you don&#039;t want to leave any tracks.

				Thanks that&#039;s some really good info. Do you know of anything other than MAC addresses that can identify a given computer on a network? Currently I&#039;m thinking:<br /><br />1. Pre-paid 3g dongle<br />2. Spoofed MAC address<br />3. TOR<br /><br />I know the above will to be a lot better than using home internet with TOR but if I&#039;m making all this effort I&#039;d rather have it 100% anonymous if possible (well 99.9% anyway).<br /><br />Thanks for all your help with this!

				There are plenty of other factors that contribute to the identification of a computer on the Internet.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a website that tests your browser for &quot;uniqueness.&quot;&nbsp; https://panopticlick.eff.org<br /><br />The &quot;uniqueness score&quot; doesn&#039;t positively identify your computer (as a MAC address would) but it shows you how all sorts of information about the computer you are using can be analyzed to make you a little less anonymous on the web.

				Point 1 makes this pretty safe, but you should look into how safe is the prepaid 3G Dongle.<br />3G uses cell towers I guess so the cell info will tell your rough location, might be possible to triangle your position, but I&#039;m really incompetent in this topic so I shouldn&#039;t say anything.<br /><br />I&#039;d add a bridge, so the fact that you are using Tor won&#039;t be obvious, in case the government decides to harvest every IP that was connecting to Tor around your location, but even then everything would be pretty safe on your end, the only concern I can see is an attack from the other end, exploiting your system, like someone sends you malicious code, trojans whatever.<br />Are you planning to use a Live CD like Tails?<br />
