			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello,<br />This is a throw away account, and no PM&#039;s will be answered or even checked. I am using multiple reflectors to get to this forum beyond simple TOR.<br /><br />Background (bear with me):<br /><br />I am a CBSA (Canadian Border Service Agent in a CCRA/ Canada Post clearing house. (the Candian version of the IRS in the USA). My job is secondary inspection, and I am what&#039;s called a team lead (first level management inside the government hierarchy).<br /><br />Three years ago, I was in an accident, the nature of which I will not disclose for security reasons. My rehab took over a year of exercise and a steady diet of Demerol (Meperidine) (50mg) IM, and Ativan (1mg) at least twice a day.&nbsp; Eventually the Demerol was switched out for Dilaudid (Hydromorphone).&nbsp; My physical health is better, but I have developed a nasty dependence on Opiates and Benzo&#039;s since that I have been unwilling/unable to kick.<br /><br />This was not a problem, as I had a friendly doctor, but lately the OXY scare has made even the most liberal MD switch people off to things like Toradol (Ketorolac) and Talwin (Pentazocine) in order to avoid the hassles from the CMA (Canadian Medical Association.) and lose their prescribing license.<br /><br />I know all the ER shopping tricks, and ER nurses and doctors do too. That is a pointless endeavour.&nbsp; I have acquaintances who are B.R.M (if I have to explain that one, you don&#039;t need to know), who hook me up occasionally, but they want unreasonable favors in my official capacity as payment.<br /><br />SR. Is a god-send.&nbsp; The prices are terrible for somebody like me on a government salary, but some creative juggling has allowed me to control my habit.&nbsp; I talked to several separate vendors who have expressed concerns shipping to Canada because of our strict customs regimen. So my gift back to you international vendors is some tricks of the trade to increase the likelyhood of you getting your packages through.<br /><br />1: Do not use brown bubble wrap envelopes with pre-printed BS looking return addresses that do not match the postmark.&nbsp; That&#039;s going to secondary.<br /><br />2: Never pack glass. It tinkles, in transit, even surrounded in bubble wrap, it&#039;s hard/impossible to hide it&#039;s shape from our BSX scanners. We seize more steroids than any other drugs because of this.<br /><br />3: Do not try to use perfume/cologne/coffee/patchouli/sage to hide tell-tale odours.&nbsp; Our dogs love all those smells, and again: Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />4: If you ship more than an ounce of anything, it will more likely get through if you make it look like a care package from family.&nbsp; Handwritten address, full return addresses, and neat careful tape jobs with your product safetly placed in some more innocuous container.<br /><br />5:Powders andd pills leave a very distinct outline on the outside of plain envelopes. Buy those cheap leather single credit card holders and put them in something like that. We see packages all the time with 20-30 little round punch-out looking holes in plain white envelopes.&nbsp; Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />6: Watch countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;These countries are updated monthly, but the following are a giant red flag and no matter how pretty the package, it&#039;s getting a second look:&nbsp; Pakistan, India, Netherlands, Greece, Afghanistan, Columbia, Panama, Portugal, Serbia, Croatia.&nbsp; Use- re-mailers, try to get your packages sent from anywhere in the UK (with the exception of Northern Ireland).&nbsp; Italy comes and goes as a red-flag origin, but is usually safe.&nbsp; If you mist ship from these countries, ship small letter shaped/sized documents, postcards are best.<br /><br />7: DO NOT SHIP LIQUIDS. I repeat, DO NOT SHIP liquids.&nbsp; They break, they leak, they condensate, they swish when you move them.&nbsp; We have a weight scale that rolls suspicious packages at 1.5Gs RMS and it tells us immediately if there is liquid in the package.<br /><br />8: Use exact postage.&nbsp; It seems strange, but illicits usually over-postage their packs, apparently Ted Kaszinski did this too.. odd.<br /><br />So those are your biggest hurdles shipping internationally into Canada.&nbsp; If you do it smartly, aren&#039;t overzealous, split your large shipments and avoid Montreal, Cornwall, and Vancouver&nbsp; clearing houses, I&#039;d say you have a&nbsp; better than 90% chance of getting your product through un-molested.<br /><br />Out.<br />

				Thanks for realizing there are sometimes benefits, and these guys on SR aren&#039;t the cartels.&nbsp; Good info on the liquid detection method.<br /><br />I can confirm the back-scatter x-ray (BSX) info.&nbsp; When low energy x-rays are fired at an object, they cause interactions which produce Compton electrons.&nbsp; These bastards go in every direction.&nbsp; The more object density, the more Comptons.&nbsp; This is how they detect dense objects like guns under clothing at airports, etc.&nbsp; Paper, obviously, has the density of jack shit, while glass and liquids are relatively dense.&nbsp; Pretty damn obvious, and no way to mask its shape without getting really creative.

Here&#039;s why... It can&#039;t possibly be a thing of suspicion to notice a professional looking package with a printed label. No postal officer is going to say &quot;printed label, well packaged - this seems suspicious&quot; - simply because, if you&#039;ve ever ordered anything from amazon/internet you would know that this is how 99% of packages arrive anyway.<br /><br />But a handwritten package? That instantly shows you that it is unlikely to have come from a corporate source. Therefore it is either a family thing/a small time company/possible suspicious package.<br /><br />Whereas a normal printed label package, is exactly the same as 99% of all the other corporate post there. Why would you write a handwritten address to make it look like a care package, when a printed address will make it look like 99% of all other business post?<br /><br />I am weary of people celebrating anything written here from &quot;LE&quot; as instantly true. For all we know this guy could just be sewing disinformation. Not making any accusations but we shouldn&#039;t rule it out.<br /><br />Vendors right now aren&#039;t having any trouble using printed labels. Over 99% of everything gets through and the ones that don&#039;t are typically either due to scammers lying/packages from dodgy countries/flukes. If people start reporting that their shit is getting seized more then maybe we&#039;d have to look at the protocol but right now it seems like the conventional wisdom of printed labels being better stands up to the real world evidence.<br /><br />

What legit company sends out stuck on labels? Those labels dont look anything like something from amazon/internet!<br /><br />I have said it before but who the fuck gets business mail these days especially from OS?? Its all email ffs. Utility notices yes, bank statements sure, legal documents? Does your SR mail look anything like these? No fucking way. Mine stand out. how is yours?<br /><br /><br />I think you will find the propaganda is from that shitty document that keeps rearing its ugly head around here about &quot;hand written&quot; letters are a flag.

				Take a look at your mail. <br />How much of it comes with a printed label made from a office supply store printed on a little laser printer?<br />If your mail is anything like mine, only SR mail comes like this. Funny that.<br />Utility mail has company logos or those little window envelopes, pre printed postage paid.<br />I just checked all my mail for my business and home and none of it looks like SR mail.<br />I have received some packages from ebay in the last couple of weeks....

				I took the OP&#039;s hand-written-addressing as a way to increase success rate with large (1 oz or more) deliveries.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be noticed hidden in something, as part of a &#039;care package&#039; from home/friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not advocating this, nor deriding it, just what I think the OP was getting at.

I also get how a printed label/envelope has an advantage over handwritten when it comes to automatic sorting machines, although the sorting machines look sophisticated enough to be able to read hand written no problem.<br /><br />Sure.. small business use label makers. Our business doesn&#039;t because it is rare that we have to send out &quot;business mail&quot;/invoice. and when we do it gets printed and the address is shown in a window or sometimes it gets hand written. Like I say go through your mail. How much comes with a printed label? Its called email btw.<br /><br />Domestically it works I suppose. But across borders I consider the current trend of stick on labels/ printed envelope with a return business address to be fail.<br /><br />I just look at all the legit OS packaging I get and look at SR mail and have drawn the conclusion that they look very dissimilar. Why? Because the only OS stuff myself or anyone I know ever gets is a package/bulky item(ebay/amazon/online vendor), handwritten envelopes with a birthday/xmas card. <br /><br />It is not just border security you have to fool. It is the guys that deliver your shit everyday that like drugs too ;)<br /><br />If it works for you why change! If your success is low as a vendor or buyer, I feel you need to start looking at alternatives.<br />

				BTW you should try kratom. It is cross-tolerant with opioid and is considered to be incredibly similar to suboxone without really impairing you or being additive in and of itself. You can make it into a tea and while you won&#039;t feel exceptionally high it will take away your pain and your craving for opoids. I have a friend who has a problem with his back and was addicted to opiates and he has tapered back by taking kratom and occassionally MXE. MXE is also a great opoid replacement for severe pain as it really takes away your pain with less long-term side effects. It was created by a guy with phantom limb syndrome.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> 8: Use exact postage.&nbsp; It seems strange, but illicits usually over-postage their packs, apparently Ted Kaszinski did this too.. odd. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is super true. While it may just be easier to throw three stamps on a letter for international it is a hell of a lot better to pay the exact amounts even though small denomination stamps are harder to find. paying 2 stamps+ a .10 and a .5 is a lot better than throwing 3 .45s. <br /><br />

				I would agree with the suggestion to make a larger shipment look like a &quot;care package&quot; from family.<br /><br />My family receives USPS flat rate boxes from USA almost every month thru &quot;famously difficult&quot; aussie customs. They are crammed to the gills with crap (sorry mom in law, it is true). They are hand addressed, with return address clearly matching postmark and carefully taped up. They contain all kinds of random stuff.<br /><br />Not a single one has ever been opened.<br /><br />If they were opened ounces of illict stuff in any one of a dozen items still wouldn&#039;t be found unless there was a chemical signature that drove a determined inspector to tear to pieces or individually x-ray everything in the box.<br /><br />Of course this kind of shipping costs a lot more. For a 4kg box it might be $50.

I am using multiple reflectors to get to this forum beyond simple TOR.<br /><br />Background (bear with me):<br /><br />I am a CBSA (Canadian Border Service Agent in a CCRA/ Canada Post clearing house. (the Candian version of the IRS in the USA). My job is secondary inspection, and I am what&#039;s called a team lead (first level management inside the government hierarchy).<br /><br />Three years ago, I was in an accident, the nature of which I will not disclose for security reasons. My rehab took over a year of exercise and a steady diet of Demerol (Meperidine) (50mg) IM, and Ativan (1mg) at least twice a day.&nbsp; Eventually the Demerol was switched out for Dilaudid (Hydromorphone).&nbsp; My physical health is better, but I have developed a nasty dependence on Opiates and Benzo&#039;s since that I have been unwilling/unable to kick.<br /><br />This was not a problem, as I had a friendly doctor, but lately the OXY scare has made even the most liberal MD switch people off to things like Toradol (Ketorolac) and Talwin (Pentazocine) in order to avoid the hassles from the CMA (Canadian Medical Association.) and lose their prescribing license.<br /><br />I know all the ER shopping tricks, and ER nurses and doctors do too. That is a pointless endeavour.&nbsp; I have acquaintances who are B.R.M (if I have to explain that one, you don&#039;t need to know), who hook me up occasionally, but they want unreasonable favors in my official capacity as payment.<br /><br />SR. Is a god-send.&nbsp; The prices are terrible for somebody like me on a government salary, but some creative juggling has allowed me to control my habit.&nbsp; I talked to several separate vendors who have expressed concerns shipping to Canada because of our strict customs regimen. So my gift back to you international vendors is some tricks of the trade to increase the likelyhood of you getting your packages through.<br /><br />1: Do not use brown bubble wrap envelopes with pre-printed BS looking return addresses that do not match the postmark.&nbsp; That&#039;s going to secondary.<br /><br />2: Never pack glass. It tinkles, in transit, even surrounded in bubble wrap, it&#039;s hard/impossible to hide it&#039;s shape from our BSX scanners. We seize more steroids than any other drugs because of this.<br /><br />3: Do not try to use perfume/cologne/coffee/patchouli/sage to hide tell-tale odours.&nbsp; Our dogs love all those smells, and again: Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />4: If you ship more than an ounce of anything, it will more likely get through if you make it look like a care package from family.&nbsp; Handwritten address, full return addresses, and neat careful tape jobs with your product safetly placed in some more innocuous container.<br /><br />5:Powders andd pills leave a very distinct outline on the outside of plain envelopes. Buy those cheap leather single credit card holders and put them in something like that. We see packages all the time with 20-30 little round punch-out looking holes in plain white envelopes.&nbsp; Welcome to secondary.<br /><br />6: Watch countries.&nbsp; &nbsp;These countries are updated monthly, but the following are a giant red flag and no matter how pretty the package, it&#039;s getting a second look:&nbsp; Pakistan, India, Netherlands, Greece, Afghanistan, Columbia, Panama, Portugal, Serbia, Croatia.&nbsp; Use- re-mailers, try to get your packages sent from anywhere in the UK (with the exception of Northern Ireland).&nbsp; Italy comes and goes as a red-flag origin, but is usually safe.&nbsp; If you mist ship from these countries, ship small letter shaped/sized documents, postcards are best.<br /><br />7: DO NOT SHIP LIQUIDS. I repeat, DO NOT SHIP liquids.&nbsp; They break, they leak, they condensate, they swish when you move them.&nbsp; We have a weight scale that rolls suspicious packages at 1.5Gs RMS and it tells us immediately if there is liquid in the package.<br /><br />8: Use exact postage.&nbsp; It seems strange, but illicits usually over-postage their packs, apparently Ted Kaszinski did this too.. odd.<br /><br />So those are your biggest hurdles shipping internationally into Canada.&nbsp; If you do it smartly, aren&#039;t overzealous, split your large shipments and avoid Montreal, Cornwall, and Vancouver&nbsp; clearing houses, I&#039;d say you have a&nbsp; better than 90% chance of getting your product through un-molested.<br /><br />Out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
