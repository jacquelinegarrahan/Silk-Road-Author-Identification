				Hey guys, I have my credit card, and I want to somehow get that into BTC. However, I want most of the links in the chain to be untraceable, as I have concerns that my bank transfers are being tracked.<br /><br />I know that BTC, by nature, is anonymous, but getting from my card to BTC without leaving a nice trail is my concern.<br /><br />Any recommendations? I was thinking of using WMZ, LR, or some combination of digital currencies.<br /><br />What&#039;s your thoughts guys?<br /><br />And, before anyone says anything, it&#039;s not an attempt at anything illegal, monetarily. Just an attempt and not being examined.

				Hmm, this could be a problem. Mostly as I prefer to simply do it all digitally. I also tend to travel a lot, and access to a bank isn&#039;t always easy.<br /><br />But, I thought you were an Almond Whirl?

				Ahhh! Well, will do then. That&#039;s gotta be the best way, unless I can come to some agreement with a BTC seller as to my not causing chargebacks. :-(<br /><br />C&#039;est la vie. Could be worse!
