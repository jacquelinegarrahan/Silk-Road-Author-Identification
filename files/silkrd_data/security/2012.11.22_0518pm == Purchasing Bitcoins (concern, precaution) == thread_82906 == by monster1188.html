				I have been studying for about 3 weeks now about how to purchase and transfer bitcoins. So far the conclusion I have came to was to go to a Wal-Mart and buy a $150 moneypak, and then sell it to Sugar Mama. Then I started getting paranoid about that situation after reading a thread about how MoneyPak&#039;s are not &quot;fully anonymous&quot;. Firstly I am still in college so to go to my Wal-Mart to buy a $100+ Moneypak seems sketchy in the first place, but none the less nothing is wrong with purchasing bitcoins. So then I explored sites such as BitInstand, Mt.Gox, and BitMe. So far it seems like I am leaning towards using Bitme. All I would have to do is go to my Chase bank and make a deposit, and not have to deal with the extra fees. So I went on the site, put in the amount I wanted, and proceeded to the next page. I put in that I wanted to deposit $120, but it told me that I was to put $116.81 in the account. It just seems strange to ever go to a bank and deposit change to me. I understand they want to verify I made the deposit, but is it unusual to put exact change in the bank, or do you put maybe $117 in and get $.19 back?<br /><br />Which way should go for, Chase cash deposit with a fee of 5% or MoneyPak with a fee of 20%?

				Depositing exact change into a bank/account is in no way out of the ordinary or &quot;strange&quot;. For all the bank knows you are paying someone for goods or services performed. Business&#039;s pay people this way all the time.<br /><br />Bitme allows you to do bank deposits? lol that is actually my preference. You have nothing to worry about unless you are depositing SERIOUS amounts of money.<br /><br />And if they dont ask for ID than your more then good.

				The problem is that I am younger, I am only in my Freshman year at a community college. So I never have had bills I had to pay for except for like my cell phone, and I use my bank to directly do that via BillPay. So to do this I go to Chase, fill out a deposit slip with all that info. Then give it to them? When I deposit cash at my bank I usually have to sign at the bottom, is this not required at Chase? If it is can I sign with my real alias?

				Can you link me to these sites, and cash in the mail seems so risky for the buyer. The seller could just say they never received the mail, and instantly they are up $100. There is nothing that can protect me?

				I tell my friends in the USA to go with a branch in another country. In this case, I&#039;ll recommend Canada. There&#039;s a quick and easy site - www.canadianbitcoins.com - which should serve you well. Doing this will help mask you.<br /><br />You will go through their system and receive a page to print. Do so, and you send this page along with the amount you specified to them via mail. I would suggest adding about 20% more than what you&#039;re buying, to account for price changes. Write a small letter letting them know you&#039;re doing this, and tell them to either add it on to your purchase or keep the change. This will also make them like you, which is always a plus. This whole ordeal, the actual buying of the bitcoins, doesn&#039;t have to be anonymous. Hell, you can walk into the office on Ottawa and buy them face-to-face if you so please. Bitcoins are NOT illegal so there&#039;s really no problem! The next stages must be.<br /><br />They will then deposit the bitcoins into the account you specified to them during the ordering process. This account should not be your SR account, as that is traceable and just downright retarded. Have them send it to a wallet. Then, you can send the bitcoins on to another wallet. (Ideally you should split the bitcoins among multiple wallets at first so the same amount doesn&#039;t get sent wallet to wallet, that can look obvious) Once done, delete the first wallet. Then send them on to your personal wallet. Delete the second wallet. This means there are two middle men between your bitcoin supplier and you. Hard to trace. Then you can send them through two more disposable wallets to your SR account.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a service called Bitcoinfog (I can find you the link if you want) which scrambles the bitcoins among hundreds of accounts over a few days then sends them out to you clean as can be. Never used it though, myself. Heard it&#039;s safe though.<br /><br />Finally, you can make your purchase on SR. It seems complicated, but it&#039;s simple and it&#039;s safe.<br /><br />Bitcoin Supply &gt; Wallet1 &gt; Wallet2 &gt; Delete Wallet1 &gt; Personal Wallet &gt; Delete Wallet2 &gt; Wallet3 &gt; Wallet4 &gt; Delete Wallet3 &gt; SR &gt; Delete Wallet4 &gt; Make Purchase.<br /><br />You can have as few or as many disposable wallets as you want. It&#039;s all personal preference.<br /><br />PM me with any questions.<br /><br />Happy Buying!<br /><br />- The Consultant

I honestly think it&#039;s better to do too much to protect yourself than do too little and get caught. Just my opinion. I think I am just going to buy a $100 MoneyPak, is tax tacked on to MoneyPaks. So $100 will be $105 + $4.95 + $3.XX?

				Just do a bank deposit with Captain Mal above me.&nbsp; Yes there is a fee but it&#039;s worth it and anonymous.&nbsp; You walk into the bank, fill out the deposit, hand them the cash.&nbsp; The teller says to me, &quot;so you&#039;re hooking this guy up, huh?&quot;&nbsp; I just said I was paying this person for doing coding for a website that I was designing.&nbsp; Simple as that, nothing suspicious, completely anonymous, although you are on camera.&nbsp; BTC in your account within an hour.&nbsp;
