				Woke up this morning to find a letter from customs addressed to me. <br /><br />Recently made my 4th purchase on SR, within a month of joining, from Chemicalbrothers. My first order with them was great. However, on this one, I didn&#039;t have enough funds to add the extra of an anti-smell bag like I did in my first order and I guess that&#039;s what got it seized.<br /><br />Moving on: The letter showed the name and address I provided to the aforementioned vendor, along with the seizure of contents(2 pills).<br /><br />The letter is long enough but in summary I have a month to claim them(obviously not going to). The only option I see is to not claim. If I don&#039;t within one month they&#039;ll offer me &quot;settlement terms&quot; or &quot;dispose of the goods&quot;.<br /><br />It also says in addition to the seizure of the goods that the offender is liable to prosecution.<br /><br />What does this mean for my future here on SR? Is my address going to be flagged? Should I consider opening a P.O box? I&#039;m expecting another purchase to turn up in the next week from America, will that likely be seized now because of this letter to my address? Or will nothing change and should I just be more careful in who I deal with and the vendor uses good packaging? Should I expect the cops at my door any day now?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I would give up on that address mate.<br />Irish customs have a lot less to worry about than UK and proportionately more manpower for each case. I don&#039;t think it is worth the risk.

				They probably are not too concerned with the current one, particularly if it is only two pills. Any further seizures would probably lead to Police involvement, which you do not want.<br />I would remove any drugs and paraphanelia from your house and stash them somewhere not linked to you and just take the week as normal. <br />If the American order arrives then I would stash it straight away, there is nothing you can do now except sit tight and wait. If they are going to nick you then they will, if not then they wont. I am sorry that I cannot say any more than that but I do not know much about the Irish drugs policy.

Although personally never experianced it, better safe then sorry.<br /><br />I&#039;d clean your pad, diluted bleach I think should help clean up surfaces/residues. Move anything that could get you in trouble. Open some windows to let anything air out.<br /><br />Hopefully the others get by without a hitch, but i&#039;d personally take a leave on using that address for a good while. :(<br /><br />PS. Try not to breath in too much bleach, not very good for you :)

				One thing I was thinking of doing is getting people from foreign countries to send me a few envelopes a week. If customs have flagged me will their attention slowly lower if they&#039;re checking a large volume of envelopes and finding nothing each time? Then I could attempt slipping a small amount of substance through a few months down the line and their attentiveness will have dropped?

				It might work, or it might draw more attention to you.<br />Personally I would find a different drop address.

				If they find anything once your address is flagged forever. Google Ireland mail drop, Ireland virtual office, Ireland PO box with street address and use a company name to import from now on. I&#039;d also heed that guy&#039;s advice to clean out evidence from your place if you have more shipments on the way<br /><br />Question, was it a regular envelope or was it some sort of package? Seems flat envelopes almost always get through Ireland customs<br />

Also vacuum sealing doesn&#039;t 100% guarantee that a dog won&#039;t pick it up, yes it will defeat a human but a dog can smell that you have rolled a joint even after you wash your hands - their noses are very sensitive. For just pills I think maybe they detected it some other way, or just a random inspection, who knows. Claiming for it would be really fucking dumb I agree, don&#039;t do that shit. And whatever happens NEVER admit anything to the police, if you don&#039;t admit to it they can&#039;t prove you ordered it, remember that.
