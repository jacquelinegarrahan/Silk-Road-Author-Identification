				Okey. I was browsing my facebook and saw this post and couldn&#039;t stop smiling.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----IMPORTANT MESSAGE---<br />My friends, we all know that the governments spy on us through internet. We must be safe with all of our information. All people should stop browsing through normal browsers because of the cookies and search history. We should download Google Chrome and every time we want to surf or check our facebook we must begin with opening an new incognito window. With this all of our info will be safe.<br /><br />Fortunately there is also a mobile app. The war is getting serious and we must protect our data! Do it right!!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />And unfortunately he/she is not trolling...<br />I could find anything to comment on that....<br /><br />And with this &quot;funny&quot; post I say good night to all of you anonymous friends.<br /><br />Adamiz

I don&#039;t even use social media and saw it from a picture in a &quot;fail&quot; pictures website.<br /><br />Secondly, maybe I am not afraid of law enforcement. I have not anything to hide at my house. If they want to come to arrest me for writing in a forum let them come and lose their time. I will just laugh.<br /><br />Lastly. I know that LE are over here and checks. Despite the fact that I am not afraid of something in all my forum history I have revealed characteristics that even if someone will &quot;follow&quot; me through all my posts they will end in a conclusion that I have a mental disorder multipersonality problem or this account is being used my many. Don&#039;t forget that people can write anything they want, truths or lies. I have invested quite a time on thinking how to be safe here. In one post I am German, in other American, in other form Italy etc etc. The only thing that someone would be sure by looking through all my posts is that I am a male. But again, that is what I want to show. Maybe it is my intention to do so...<br /><br />Anyway thanks for your advices. I guess they are welcome because many can make silly mistakes. <br /><br />Take care and be safe!<br /><br />Adamiz

The book&#039;s name is: Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah.<br /><br />It is a small book that can be read in 3-4 hours maximum and it is full of marvelous quotes from a reluctant Messiah :) Plus the story is really sweet if I can say. <br /><br />Amazing book, easy to read and really inspirational.
