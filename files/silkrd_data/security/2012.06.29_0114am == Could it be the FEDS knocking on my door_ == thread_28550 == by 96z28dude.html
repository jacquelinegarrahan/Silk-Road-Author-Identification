				Okay, so I live in central USA. Yesterday on Wednesday my grandpa said that two guys dressed in suits came to my house at about 9am knocking on the door and no one answered because I was sleeping. Then the next day (today) the same two guys came at the same time and were knocking on my door but I was once again asleep. I am wondering if this could be the feds or something? Maybe because I use tor? But I haven&#039;t ordered anything off of this website ever&nbsp; ;D so I should be in the clear.... I have read about people getting visits from the feds on here though because of the fact that they use tor. I know people say DO NOT EVER talk to the police. So if they come to my house tomorrow and I answer (because this is really pissing me off) should I just say &quot;lawyer&quot; or &quot;can I speak to my lawyer&quot;. But I don&#039;t have a lawyer&nbsp; :&#039;( But I could get a lawyer right? I&#039;m just freakin out right now cuz I live at my moms house and I don&#039;t need to be bringing this kind of heat here. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks

				They show up in a car though. And they sat in my driveway for 15 minutes! I&#039;m just kind of freakin out... I recently ordered 50 grams of 4-mec for a friend off of a website but it is legal in the USA so I don&#039;t know wtf the feds would want to ask me.

				all joking aside, it is not illegal to use TOR, so no, if they are feds that wouldn&#039;t be why they are there. If you had a package intercepted, you would likely get a love letter - lots of threads in the forum on this. Really, if it was me i would clean house, and if they show up again tell them to quit bothering you. Don&#039;t let them in, don&#039;t talk to them.It&#039;s probably bible thumpers. LEO wouldn&#039;t keep showing up hoping that maybe they could catch you at home, at least not in my neck of the woods.

				Answer the door and politely tell them the truth. You&#039;re a closet homosexual that uses tor to surf gay porn and the reason you haven&#039;t answered the door is because you like federal agent #1&#039;s partner and have been spanking it in your bedroom window while they sit in their car.

				I think its the feds or the marshals honestly. It just doesn&#039;t make sense to me why they would want to talk to me about anything. If they thought that I was up to something illegal I would think that they would want to catch me in the act. I&#039;m gonna be so pissed if its the Mormons or something like that&nbsp; &gt;:( the reason I don&#039;t think its the Mormons is because they wouldn&#039;t drive to my house 2 days in a row and only my house. I don&#039;t know... this just isn&#039;t making any sense to me. If it is the feds and they start asking crazy questions I&#039;m just gonna say &quot;I respectfully decline your questions until my lawyer is present&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they can hold me in the police station forever because they think that I&#039;m doing something illegal, they have to catch me in the act and arrest me. They aren&#039;t just going to come up to my house dressed up in a nice suit and be like &quot;oh hello sir, we are with the FBI and we think that you are doing whatever, we need you to come down for questioning&quot;. Bottom line is if it&#039;s the feds I&#039;m not answering a damn question until I get a lawyer in there&nbsp; 8)

				hey man i remember i had missionaries (the mormons) knocking on my door every single day for three weeks straight. usually what they do is they are stationed to a specific location, in this sense, where you live. what they do is go door to door talking to people about God and Joseph Smith and all the shit they believe in. and they basically just try to convert you, or at least get a donation. see if they go to your neighbors&#039; houses at all. hope this helps and you can be a little more mellow about the situation! <br />cheers

				Remember, if they had any concrete evidence on you wouldn&#039;t be around talking to us. Incase your paranoia is correct be calm. If they ask you ANY QUESTIONS quickly ask them if you&#039;re being arrested. If not, tell them to give you their card and you will have your attorney call them. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be a dick. Don&#039;t be scared. And if you repeat what I said(even the gay joke) you will be shutting the door in no time and then you can plan your next move. Be smart. Not a statistic.

				Don&#039;t worry OP fedral prison has a tor based drug network in prison. How it works:<br /><br />You&#039;re blindfolded while an ANONYMOUS guy offers you drugs. <br /><br />You accept. He requires you to FE(same as some vendors on SR).<br /><br />You agree<br /><br />He then pulls down your pants and fucks you in the ass. Unfortunately with this type of tor network the CODERS leave open back doors exposing your security. This is generally when other ANONS come in and get in on the deal.<br /><br />Afterwards you get drugs and can leave feedback with warden(usually doesn&#039;t matter)<br /><br />Be careful however. There are TonyScammers that require FE and don&#039;t give drugs.<br /><br />Good luck!

While they makes their threats and LIE about what evidence they have against and who&nbsp; spilled the beans on you&nbsp; and how your mom or&nbsp; dad already talked just&nbsp; sit there and and sing your favorite song to your self or hum the love boat theme out load and keep looking at your watch and&nbsp; ask where your attorney is.<br /><br />All jokes aside OP. make sure you are encrypted ok&nbsp; and&nbsp; don&#039;t share with your friends your knowledge of&nbsp; SR.&nbsp; Your best friend one day might be your worst enemy the next. If you are that worried.&nbsp; destroy your harddrive and your nic cause of its MAC address&nbsp; &nbsp;the whole damn&nbsp; motherboard if its onboard NIC&nbsp; and&nbsp; set up a wireless network and leave it open. Should they have anything on you&nbsp; &nbsp; mac address&nbsp; &nbsp;IP address point of origin&nbsp; etc..etc&nbsp; &nbsp;it can not be used against you if you are not in possession of those items and while&nbsp; &nbsp;open network illegal activity is not a defensible argument in court&nbsp; &nbsp; from the sounds of it all if you&nbsp; do this all&nbsp; or even if you don&#039;t&nbsp; I would say you are worried over nothing but better to be safe than sorry&nbsp;

				I vote no x file type feds in briefcases waiting for you, to take you into the unknown. Buy your drugs from SR. it sounds like you were completely tweaked..staring out a corner of a blind thinking they are coming for you...when they are just wondering who this guy in his underwear and shotgun is that keeps &quot;secretly&quot; watching them. I actually take back order from SR because if you are so paranoid just from downloading Tor, you might start shooting up the block if you start tweaking about ordering on here.
