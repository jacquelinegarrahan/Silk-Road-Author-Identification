				if you don&#039;t already know, the mybitcoin.com claim process was made available not long ago:&nbsp; https://www.mybitcoin.com/claim.php<br /><br /><br />this does me no good!&nbsp; shortly before mybitcoin was taken offline, i transferred 8 coins from mybitcoin to SR.&nbsp; the transfer never made it to SR and after reaching out to SR, they tell me it never hit their servers.&nbsp; i have transaction id&#039;s and proof of the transaction being submitted.<br /><br />the claim process only allows those with coinsstored in their mybitcoin wallet to file a claim.<br /><br />when i file a claim, it rejects me and says i have 0 coins in my account.&nbsp; so my coins were siphoned?&nbsp; lost?&nbsp; stolen?&nbsp; sent to never-never-land?<br /><br />should i let it go?&nbsp; or pursue this somehow?&nbsp; i don&#039;t want to raise any flags because i made a transfer to SR.&nbsp; what would you do?&nbsp;

				Definitely let it go, not worth it to draw attention that account when it was sent to SR.

				Well, yeah, let it go with MyBitcoin, but I&#039;d definitely take it up with SR again.<br /><br />Send copies of the info you have showing the to/from addresses and the dates and any other info.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d lay odds that he&#039;ll do something for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s obviously out of MBC&#039;s hands.&nbsp; That means those 8 BTC went SOMEPLACE.&nbsp; Must have been into the depths of SR. :)&nbsp; Good luck!

				i think i was burned.&nbsp; block explorer returns zero results on the TO and FROM address<br /><br />i don&#039;t know wth happened.&nbsp; i&#039;ve successfully transferred coins to SR a number of times......<br /><br />SR just replied and there&#039;s nothing they can do.&nbsp; i still suspect mybitcoin as the culprit.&nbsp; now i&#039;m negative $100 usd<br /><br />ugh

				Sounds like you are out of luck if you traced the addresses and did not turn up anything.<br /><br />Silk Road is very good about tracking down lost bitcoin, but he does get busy so be patient.<br /><br />The key to recovery is the deposit address. In theory only you and Silk Road know that address (it&#039;s public, but only the two of you know it is a Silk Road address). If bitcoin was received at that address Silk will make sure it ends up in your account. Before you message Silk make sure you see it in the block explorer and you have given Silk Road inc 12 hours to confirm the transfer. If it is not in the block explorer, than it is an issue on the sending end, Silk Road does not have it, and there is nothing he can do.

				If Blockexplorer shows nothing then MyBitcoin never sent them and SR is not responsible.
