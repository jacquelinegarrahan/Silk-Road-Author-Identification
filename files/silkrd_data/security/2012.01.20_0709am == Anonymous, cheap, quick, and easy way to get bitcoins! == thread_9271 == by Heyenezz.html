				Buy bitcoins at https://get-bitcoin.com/.<br /><br />The only personal info they require is an e-mail address, name, bitcoin address, and a scanned image of the cash deposit (which I e-mailed).<br /><br />Use tormail for your e-mail address. You can sign up for one at http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/. Sign into Squirrel Mail Webmail when sending and receiving e-mail since it uses no javascript.<br /><br />Give get-bitcoin.com a fake name, and use a bitcoin address at https://www.instawallet.org.<br /><br />After the order&#039;s placed purchase the bitcoins using a cash deposit at Chase bank. Sign the deposit slip with the same fake name you gave get-bitcoin.com. Keep the receipt of the cash deposit, scan the receipt, strip all metadata from the image using the program stripper (get this program at http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30), then e-mail the image from your tormail account as get-bitcoin&#039;s instructions require.<br /><br />Once the bitcoins are in your instawallet account, send them to a few more instawallets, and then finally to your SR bitcoin address. <br /><br />You&#039;re done!<br /><br />GENERAL NOTES:<br />----Total transaction fees will be 5% of the cash deposit.<br />----Bitcoins will usually be in the bitcoin address you gave them in less than 24 hours.<br />----Access each of the above sites using a different Tor identity. Your Tor identity is the IP address you hide behind when using the Tor network. You can change your Tor identity by clicking &quot;Use a new identity&quot; on the Vidalia Control Panel.<br />----Use a different Tor identity each time you visit a site even f you&#039;ve been to that site before.<br />-----Use a different Tor identity for each site visit, including each and every time you visit an instawallet account.<br />----Use Tor to visit one and only one site at a time.<br />-----Never use the same Tor identity twice or for more than one site.

				Hi thanks for that - when I try to go to https://www.instawallet.org. using TOR I get warnings that it isn&#039;t secure.<br /><br />I even get warnings using IE.&nbsp; What is that all about - anything to worry about?&nbsp; Do lots here use it?<br /><br />

				There&#039;s a review thread of this service here:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.0<br /><br />Seems legit. No complaints anywhere. I&#039;m about to try them out.<br /><br />If you want to add an extra layer of untractability, they also accept things like Visa gift cards and money orders, which you could you buy with cash.

				Yeah, but Get-Bitcoins sometimes takes 24 hours before you get your bitcoins. I&#039;ve found an even easier, faster and more anonymous way. See my other post for details. But it&#039;s through BitInstant.com. You deposit cash at a local bank, it goes to any of 3 exchanges (Mt. Gox, TradeHill or CryptoXChange), usually within the hour, buy your bitcoins there and send them here. I guess there may be a trail from the exchanges since you need to have an account there but if you set up a fake name you should be clear. And everyone hear should have a tormail account anyway.

				Heyenezz, that&#039;s not true. You can set up a MT. Gox account with any name and a tormail email address. You make a cash deposit with no ID or signature necessary. There are no photos except for the security cameras which are at any bank. The cash goes right to Mt. Gox. You buy your bitcoins and send it straight to SR. The only weak link is that you&#039;re doing it from your computer and Mt. Gox is sometimes hard/impossible to access through Tor. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s also true for TradeHill or CryptoXchange. And it&#039;s fast, too.

				If you are not using a mix for your bitcoins, they are not anonymous. Using instawallet, multiple exchanges, etc. doesn&#039;t cut it. I don&#039;t understand why people think that bitcoin is an anonymous network.

Again, an instawallet bitcoin address can&#039;t be traced to you unless, somehow someone bothers to get video footage from the bank, use face recognition software and Internet searches to uncover your real name, then get a warrant to find out you bought bitcoins, then find out where the bitcoins where sent to, and then follow the chain of transactions.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, how would they come to suspect you in the first place? If you&#039;re that worried, then I guess you could wear a disguise. But, let&#039;s say you didn&#039;t, and someone bothered to investigate you in the way described, in the process discovering your true identity and raising suspicion that you planned to purchase drugs on SR.<br /><br />1st, how would they even know what your SR bitcoin address was? <br />2nd, they still don&#039;t have enough evidence to arrest you, and could at most get a search warrant, which is unlikely. <br /><br />If doing this worries you, then you shouldn&#039;t use drugs. SR is about as safe as drug purchases get.

The tool wirelessly transmits images to a server, which searches them against a photo database and identifies the photo&#039;s subject. As of 2010, these binoculars were already in field-testing with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.<br />...<br />Private security cameras and the cameras already in use by police departments have also advanced. They are more capable of capturing the details and facial features necessary to support facial recognition-based searches, and the software supporting them allows photo manipulation that can improve the chances of matching a photo to a person already in the database....</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>However, there are countermeasures [ cvdazzle.com ] available to those unafraid of making a fashion statement.

The tool wirelessly transmits images to a server, which searches them against a photo database and identifies the photo&#039;s subject. As of 2010, these binoculars were already in field-testing with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.<br />...<br />Private security cameras and the cameras already in use by police departments have also advanced. They are more capable of capturing the details and facial features necessary to support facial recognition-based searches, and the software supporting them allows photo manipulation that can improve the chances of matching a photo to a person already in the database....</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>However, there are countermeasures [ cvdazzle.com ] available to those unafraid of making a fashion statement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wouldn&#039;t make a fashion statement. I raise a lot of supsicion and unwanted attention by coming to a bank looking like that. If it ever gets to the point that face recognition is a serious concern, I&#039;d try mailing cash or money order mailing.

				I&#039;m a total newbie.&nbsp; I spent the last several days absorbing the collective wisdom of the forum.&nbsp; Thanks to each of you &lt;3!&nbsp; My first BTC transaction was with get-bitcoin yesterday.&nbsp; From this noob&#039;s perspective, the transaction was painless and fast.<br /><br />1. Place order through get-bitcoin.com using one of my alternate personalities and associated tormail address.<br />2. Received confirmation e-mail from get-bitcoin with account number.<br />3. Make cash deposit at Bank of America.<br />4. Scanned deposit slip with name and order number hand written on it.<br />5. E-mail deposit slip after removing meta data.<br />6. Got BTC five hours later.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m trying to build up my stats, per the Wiki&#039;s instructions, by purchasing digital goods.&nbsp; I have 11 items in my cart.&nbsp; Only if I could remember the friggin&#039; PIN!&nbsp; (The life of a noob.) Now I have to wait for 7 days for a PIN reset.&nbsp; On the bright side, this gives me time to read more about seller and their products rating.&nbsp; <br /><br />Long Live SR and its members!!!

				I&#039;ve been soaking up knowledge from these forums for a while, and finally decided I know enough from a safety perspective to place an order or two&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I used get-bitcoin.com the other day and I&#039;m happy with their service. After completing their online form I received an order number and a bank account number to deposit the money into. I went down to a local bank and deposited cash into the business account at the teller, took a pic of the receipt and stripped the info, emailed the receipt to get-bitcoin, and received my coins into an instawallet in about 5 hours. <br /><br />The fee was 5% and the coins were bought at an average market rate. I&#039;d use them again for my next deposit. Thanks for everyone&#039;s input in this thread, it made things a lot easier!<br /><br />

I can&#039;t think of a less risky way to buy drugs. Even if you had someone else fill out a money order for you then mail it using another&#039;s return address, there&#039;s still at least one other person who knows what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />You could try dying your hair, wearing colored contacts to disguise your eye color, using one specific pair of clothes only for that transaction, and wearing professional makeup to realistically disguise your skin color, and only deposit cash at a Chase branch far from your house. That effort doesn&#039;t seem worth it to me though.
