				Well it seems that MtGox has finally stopped accepting all fund transfers directly from an unverified Dwolla account<br /><br />In order to transfer funds to MtGox From your Dwolla account you now have to verify the account by providing a<br /><br />Picture ID or verification of domicile (i.e. utility bill etc...)<br /><br />I for one will not be doing so.<br /><br />So I have to look into new funding options, bitinstant looks pretty solid.<br /><br />any others I should know about?

				I&#039;m in the same boat; however, I just lost $150 to Mt.Gox that they won&#039;t release UNLESS I verify my account. Fucking thieves, I was never even given the option.. funds went straight from Dwolla to Gox and never showed up in my account. Unless I hadn&#039;t contacted Gox support, I never would have known where my funds went. I can&#039;t believe they get away with this type of bullshit..

				We had to read Dwolla&#039;s terms of service again when we logged on recently. Noticed language like &quot;money service business&quot; and &quot;virtual currency products&quot; in a restrictive clause, but can&#039;t really say if that&#039;s a new addition to their TOS. Anyone else note this?

				I&#039;m waiting for Mt Gox to verify me. I hope it doesn&#039;t take much longer, as I have 500 bux I wanna blow on SR. Really crappy how they did this. I had some $ on Dwolla that I sent back to my bank and now I&#039;ve got to figure out alternative methods of getting BTC. If I had known about the BS, I never would have used Mt Gox this time around. Really sucks, and they are taking too long to verify me.

				&quot;Well it looks like im in the same boat, I sent $260 USD to MtGox via Dwolla and it never showed up in my account&quot;<br /><br />I just transferred over $300 from Dwolla to Mt. Gox yesterday at 7am and it took almost 24 hrs to clear to Gox. If it&#039;s been more than 24hrs I would contact them to make sure it&#039;s not being held. Did you verify on both sites? I know that both want id and proof of residence now :( and they may not release funds until verified&nbsp; :-\<br />@eunoia it took them a day to verfiy me on Mt. Gox when I uploaded the docs they wanted. so hopefully not too long.

				Is this dwolla or Mtgox that is making transfers difficult ? I&#039;m really hoping this doesn&#039;t expand into other ways to get coins from mtgox. Would suck to be required using id for bit instant

				They stole my money. Don&#039;t use MtGox anymore. Here&#039;s how it went.<br /><br />1. send $50 to my mtgox account from dwolla<br />2. buy bitcoins<br />3. send bitcoins to SR address<br />4. item sells out before i can pay for it<br />5. send $50 of btc back to mtgox<br />6. withdraw into dwolla<br />7. they say i have to verify my account and are holding my funds<br />8. verify<br />9.&nbsp; they say that i dont have any money on hold<br />10. after arguing with them they give a withdraw request to a random bitcoin address for $50 saying someone must have hacked my account<br />11. tells me they can&#039;t help me<br /><br />They stole $50 from me and made me wait 10+ days for this process. Don&#039;t use these fuckers anymore..

				I just got hit with this, as well.&nbsp; I have an amount of money in my Dwolla account and I can&#039;t get it to MtGox without releasing more information than I&#039;d like to and then waiting, I guess...<br /><br />I&#039;ll try this intersango thing and report back.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Works fine.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip.&nbsp; A bit less immediate confirmation and it takes a day or so to transfer (at least for the first one) but it worked!
