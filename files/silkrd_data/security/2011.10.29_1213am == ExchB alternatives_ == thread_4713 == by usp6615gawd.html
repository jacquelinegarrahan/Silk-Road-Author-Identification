				I&#039;m not ignoring you on this one, I just don&#039;t know, especially after this latest ripoff...tradehill is o.k., but you listed the drawbacks, and not having a WF close...hopefully you&#039;ll hear some other reputable choices, just be careful....hell, even the &#039;reputable&#039; ones could head south at any moment...I always figure they&#039;re mob run, and just waiting for a certain amount of coin to be in operartion....but you looked into Paxum?&nbsp; Probably quicker than dwolla, which I agree, bank to dwolla can be 5-8 days... You probably already have&nbsp; &nbsp;been there, but good site, and has this get-bitcoin review is: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.0

				Get-bitcoin is my go&nbsp; to. That being said- I don&#039;t think you have to worry about being anonymous unless you are cashing BTC out. If you&#039;re buying BTC to get a quarter oz of herb, a couple grams of mdma, and some pills, it doesn&#039;t matter where you get them and how anonymous they are: the only time you&#039;d get in trouble is if you got caught with the DRUGS. No one cares how you bought it. your BTC transaction for 50 BTC is not going to be the nail in the coffin. <br /><br />Just my .02...vendors have a whole other problem to deal with...

I don&#039;t have any BofA around me either, so I think I&#039;m just going to go with the deposit from my bank account. Seems easy, relatively fast, and safe enough for my needs. I usually only get bud (never more than an oz) and some edibles on occasion so I&#039;m not exactly a high profile target lol. I emailed get-bitcoin and he seems straight up and very professional, so it should be a good choice<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sure, sounds good: btc are legal, fun to speculate with, that&#039;s all you&#039;re getting them for...many/most of us have some link with i.d. we have to use, just to get rolling, even if it&#039;s just getting cash at ATM, and depositing in BofA or WF...<br /><br />Main thing, I&#039;d want to do, if it were me, is just to take btc from get-bitcoin, and &#039;wash&#039; them in instawallet.org, maybe split them up between a couple of instawallets, before depositing in SR.&nbsp; Heck, w/instawallet, u don&#039;t really even need a pc wallet anymore...everybody&#039;s got different views on all this, of course, but sounds like you&#039;re on the rite track...
