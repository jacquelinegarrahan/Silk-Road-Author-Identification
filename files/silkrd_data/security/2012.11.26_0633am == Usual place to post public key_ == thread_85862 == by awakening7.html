				Hello. Being new to silk road I still haven&#039;t figured out where the best place to post my public key (as a non-vendor) is and where vendors could access it so I don&#039;t have to include it in every message. I started the thread hoping that it might help other new users as well. Thanks to all who comment. :)

				in the security section there is a sticky that is named &quot; post pgp keys here&quot;&nbsp; but no one ever checks it.&nbsp; if you are messaging a vendor i suggest sending your key with your message.&nbsp; so basicly it&#039;s the very first topic in the section you posted this topic in.&nbsp; read the sticky&#039;s they&#039;re there for a reason

				as the above user hinted at, you can post in the pgp key thread then include a link to the specific post in your signature

				i had originally been sending my public key with my encrypted messages too, but as i found out today, many vendors expect you to encrypt your message using their public key so they can open it in their pgp program without importing every buyers&#039; public keys into their keyring. i actually think this is better because it is easier for the vendor and the buyer because it gives you better security as your public key isnt stored in a sellers&#039; keyring (just in case LE catches up with them). if you do this though, i would consider making sure you delete the sellers public key after placing your order to protect them in the same way...

				Ahh yes. I saw the sticky but was still wandering if that is the best way. Thanks for the input! :)

				There is a network of searchable PGP keyservers on the clearnet that people use to find PGP keys. Ive found the keys of several vendors on there including DPR. I don&#039;t know if anybody here actually searches for keys there. If you do post a key on there make sure it does not contain any info that could be used to ID you. Don&#039;t use the same name here as anyplace on the clear net and don&#039;t use the same e-mail. <br /><br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_%28cryptographic%29

				Don&#039;t use clearnet keyservers unless it&#039;s over Tor! LE could subpoena the operators to look at the IP addresses that are downloading certain keys. I&#039;m surprised that DPR&#039;s key is on there and hope he wasn&#039;t the one who posted it.<br /><br /><br />(BTW, kudos to the mods for adding captchas. I have no problem filling them out if it slows down the spam.)

Ive actually found quite allot of PGP keys on http://pgp.mit.edu:11371 that match up with names and e-mails of people on here. If they posted those keys using the GPG software,&nbsp; that did not go through tor and their real IP addresses would be in the server logs , conveniently associated with the Identity they use to sell/buy drugs.

				What others said. Also there is a pastebin like service at 4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion<br /><br />For example, here is my key:<br />http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/paste/show.php?id=d8a0d6fbb76863ed&amp;plaintext=1<br /><br />This is a lot less text to include in every message than the actual key.

				HassleHoff, I think some PGP software is configured to upload newly created keys by default. That may be the problem. It&#039;s best to check your software and disable that feature if it exists before creating a new key.
