				Went back 7 pages through this forum, and didn&#039;t notice anything about physical security.<br /><br />Best defense in our scenario is to thoroughly know the offense. Does anyone have first hand knowledge of how thorough the ICE or DEA housing/vehicle searches?<br /><br />Assuming the worst (the people with the mission/funding/training) in that you&#039;ve attracted one of those two agencies attention, what does their search process consist of?<br /><br />Keep in mind, DO NOT GIVE IDEAS. While security through obscurity fails in the digital world, it&#039;s pretty much our saving grace.<br /><br />In order to best protect ourselves, knowing everything they will or could search, allows us to come up with ideas outside of that scope, and be protected so long as it&#039;s not something they know about. Only exception to this is mentioning some things one agency searches that some other agency might not due to lack of funding/training (like perhaps Local/County/State etc).<br /><br />So. As far as local police go in vehicles, I know they&#039;ll (somehow without damaging) rip up carpets, check under everything, even remove parts of the dashboard. I am honestly under the impression that without an extremely expensive solution, successfully avoiding discovery in a vehicle by a DEA/ICE search is probably impossible.<br /><br />Anyways, we could probably use a good thread for posting either A) Personal Experience of LEO searches of private property, and B) A place to post &quot;leaked&quot; training manuals which may cover it.<br /><br />In return for anyone contributing to this thread, I&#039;m willing to answer any questions you may have regarding digital security. Career software developer with many years of experience, and a degree in a related IT discipline involving security. I won&#039;t claim I know everything, but it&#039;s become pretty routine for me to become the goto guy when no one else knows something anywhere I work :/

				Don&#039;t receive product at the same site you are going to store product.&nbsp; If a seller gets busted, which is inevitable that some will - they are drug dealers - they might still have your information.&nbsp; Ideally sellers will destroy all information, but that&#039;s impossible to verify.&nbsp; So if LE busts a guy and finds your address that may very well be enough to get a warrant for a search of your premises.&nbsp; For this reason I suggest moving all product to a trusted friends house soon after receiving it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t travel about with large amounts - I never carry around more than I can swallow on a moments notice.&nbsp; Aside from that - don&#039;t talk to cops.

				I agree: I think perhaps we are most comfortable, and enjoy digital security, and so that&#039;s what we focus on...me too, I like libertelinux and privatix and using VM&#039;s and such...debian box...but I&#039;ve said the same thing: our real problem more than likely will just be somebody getting cracked for some stupid shit, like speeding with gear, and then trying to weasel out by giving up everything he can.&nbsp; And buyers anyway, well, as you said, we have less protection...<br /><br />The curse of this thread, is, as stated, that we can&#039;t really give up our game, as they&#039;re monitoring, or at least I operate on that theory.&nbsp; I operate on the &#039;worst case&#039; scenario, any old con knows: &#039;don&#039;t do the crime, if you can&#039;t do the time&#039; rude theory.&nbsp; I keep it simple, and I keep it quiet.&nbsp; Without being paranoid, I&#039;m always wary of &#039;changes&#039; around me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve let a couple of homeless kids receive mail at my house: nice kids.&nbsp; I sure hope the mail they get here doesn&#039;t have shit in it, but if it does, will sure be a surprise to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avoid elaborate theories, think small, and something you don&#039;t forget if you&#039;re frightened and being grilled...introduce myself to a bondsman, know how to get&#039;em 24hr a day....have attorney interested in this stuff: young, but he sees the dillema: where was crime comitted, what country, who...<br /><br />Anyway, keep it simple, and don&#039;t tell everybody in the bar about it, don&#039;t carry, have fallback position...make sure anything is 95 per cent true, it&#039;s much easier to remember.&nbsp; (Don&#039;t want elaborate fake id/po box shit, etc)...the vendors, as on the streets, carry the most legal weight, but are the hardest to identify...but if one of&#039;em does fall, and gets frightened and yaps, we could be in some shit, but if we hold our mud, it&#039;ll pass...

				phubaiblues, you sound a lot like myself.<br /><br />I never get intoxicated on any substance to the point that someone who doesn&#039;t know me extremely well can tell anything is different. I can maintain my composure, despite whatever estatic bliss or intense reality bending psychedelic I&#039;m willing to consume in such situations, I may be experiencing.<br /><br />Even close friends who know what I do, do not know everything that I do, because it&#039;s a &quot;need to know&quot; basis. I don&#039;t feel it&#039;s necessary to inform anyone what I put in my body, unless my safety is of some concern (there is almost always at least one responsible person who knows if there is any risk in something I&#039;ll be taking).<br /><br />I talk softly, don&#039;t brag, avoid confrontation with anyone and everyone at all costs, and attempt to be friends with everyone. I dress in a manner that, while eccentric, portrays only potential stereotypes that are anti-drug at most, and and at minimum make me very unmemorable.<br /><br />Always follow ever traffic law even when not carrying because it&#039;s good practice.<br /><br />I remember when I saw &quot;American Gangster&quot;, how thoroughly I agreed with his hatred for all things flashy.<br /><br />First line of defense, don&#039;t fit the profile/stereotype of a drug user/dealer AT ALL COSTS.<br /><br />It&#039;s the old hacker mentality. The best hackers, no one even knows they exist, and the people themselves, no one has a clue what they do. I remember when I was younger, I never got caught for anything I actually did, but fuck, every time something wrong happened, I was first suspect if a person involved didn&#039;t like me for some reason.<br /><br />Second line of defense, don&#039;t ever piss someone off. I understand the concept of &quot;defending your honor&quot;, or not accepting &quot;disrespect&quot;. You know what I also understand? Going to prison because someone who has a grudge with you because you retaliated against alleged slights, decided to get back at you.<br /><br />I have a problem with the saying &quot;it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both&quot; by Machiavelli. In the situation he applied it to, sure, it is logical. People with enough power, can be safer if feared due to the fact being loved may give you a false sense of security. However in the drug game, unless you&#039;re a upper level mafia member, you don&#039;t have enough power to be feared enough. Someone busted will be more afraid of prison than what you can do to them. So be loved by as many people as possible, and ensure no one has any reason to get back at you.<br /><br />If people know you have drugs on you, it is most often assumed you will have them at your place of residence. Don&#039;t let anyone you don&#039;t completely trust know where you live (or the place you store anything).<br /><br />If you are not carrying, but have &quot;suspicious&quot; items, give it as much plausibility as possible. If you have tiny baggies to store something, and have ripped up or empty bags in your car, use them for something legitimate. Store something in one or two and leave them in the car.<br /><br />Example: You use those tiny bags to store some pills, leave in your car one of those bags with some BB&#039;s in it for your BB gun. If you get pulled over and believe you will get searched, swallow them (because you should never travel with more than you can safely consume), and put the bag near the one with BB&#039;s in it. Now a formerly suspicious item is no longer suspicious!<br /><br />Same thing also with those storage things from headshops. Don&#039;t leave those in your car if there is no valid reason the&#039;d be there, and if there is a reason, leave them with other -real- items that are of a similar category. Suppose you have a fake &quot;Car Wax&quot; bottle, leave it with the rag and tire cleaner you&#039;d use when cleaning your car.<br /><br />An interesting idea I had awhile back, which might help with local law enforcement. If you have small amounts of some powder type drug that a canine unit would find, get a weed pipe, roll up the baggie and put it inside the stem of the pipe. Ensure there is a minimal amount of residue left in the bowl.<br /><br />You get searched by a canine unit, the dog can&#039;t tell the officer what it smelled, only that it smelled something. They find the pipe and give you a ticket for paraphernalia instead of you going to jail for felony possession.<br /><br />I really want to get a hold of a training manual for LEO search tactics, so if anyone finds one, please share.
