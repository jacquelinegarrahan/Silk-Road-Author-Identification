				i wanna upload photos i took with my camera not my phone, but was unsure if they can be tracked and give out my area. I heard they can&#039;t be tracked by camera only by phone as phone gives the LAT/LONG of the area it was taken. <br />SAGreat

				Yes, they can, if there is identifying metadata/exif data in the file.&nbsp; Make sure you strip all exif data from the file before you upload it, at least if it&#039;s an incriminating photo.&nbsp; See my response in this thread:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=196810.0

				The info of the gps and other info like what type of device took the picture , the pixels densety etc etc can be removed. Click on remove all. A copie to paint will copie all extra info too. With the details removed you will be harder to trace. But still you can be if a piece of a house is shown on the picture for example.<br /><br />Yes there is software in use (by the police)<br />&nbsp;that can compare a window, found on a photo with CP, with every other window on streetview.<br />Or Bing streetmaps or any other picture on the internet. <br />Even a piece of a window or door is enough to point out where the photo was made.<br /><br />The police likes to keep these kinds of software secret, to prevent a maker of CP drawing the curtains.<br /><br />If on a photo a window is shown&nbsp; and that window is 138 cm high, and the lenght is 248 cm and sits om 80 cm from the ground and is 93 cm from the door, you can software look for those measurements on google streetview, bing maps and any other picture on the internet.<br />In the Netherlands a maker of cp showed a window from the neighbor from&nbsp; across the street. The software compared that window with all the windows on google streetview and came wit a address. So if a door or window is showing, and their is a picture on the internet with that same door or window you can be pointed out.<br /><br />The xtra info as gps you can remove that easily.<br /><br />You don&#039;t mean tiny picture, or google picture search?<br />Once a photo is on the internet it is easy to find it.<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Who stole my picture&quot;&quot; is software that helps you if you want to collect copyright.<br /><br />Der Spiegel had to pay 50.000,- (fifty-thousand) euros for printing/publish a photo of Abraham Lincoln, but was a man disguised like A Lincoln. Der Spiegel had not asked permission , thinking they had the original Abe Lincoln picture.<br /><br />

				Right you definitely want to at least examine the exif and meta data to see what is in there. There&#039;s software out there that will let you edit or remove these properties. Even Windows will let you remove the properties.

				Maybe I&#039;m overly paranoid, but before stripping the EXIF data I would edit the image (Photoshop or so) and resize it (reduce size). Maybe even blur it a little. Otherwise it may or may not be possible to find out which camera model you are using, by looking at the pixels. If that is possible, and they know in which area you live, then they may get your data from Amazon or so.

				Forum members tend to over-complicate this step. Simply open the photo up in Photoshop and save as a new JPEG picture. If you&#039;d like to make sure that this worked, you can always use an online EXIF data viewer like this one:<br /><br />http://regex.info/exif.cgi (CLEARNET)

It&#039;s possible to compare the noise profile of your camera&#039;s pixels to other pictures on the Internet, which could link your SR product images to pictures that you&#039;ve uploaded elsewhere. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s software out there which actively does this but I did read a whitepaper on it a few years back. Best to resize / blur those images to be safe.

So if you used Photoshop to publish images on the clearnet, it may make you less anonymous, especially if you use an uncommon version of Photoshop. After saving the edited image it may be best to strip the image of the EXIF data. <br /><br />Btw, if you&#039;re using a clearnet service&nbsp; to check/edit your photos (http://regex.info/exif.cgi), then theoretically it&#039;s possible for someone who is sniffing the connection to save your photo to their data collection facility forever, and compare their database with the photos on Silk Road later.
