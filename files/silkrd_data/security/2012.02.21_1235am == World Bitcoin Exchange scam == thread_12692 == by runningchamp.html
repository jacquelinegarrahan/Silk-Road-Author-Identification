				6 working days ago I transferred some AUD from my bank to World Bitcoin Exchange. Normally I see the $ in my WBE account within 2 days, still not there. I call the help number and get some fucking recorded message saying we are on another call. I leave a message and get no call back. I email them and get no response. I check their facebook page to find this on their wall:<br /><br />&quot;Andre I have been trying to contact you for weeks hoping to get my money back<br />that was deposited into WBX. All you do is ignore my requests. Please be man enough to respond to my request. You cannot legally withhold my funds.Your work phone is always on answering machine and even though you say our business is important to you, you ignore its members as you ignore our emails.&quot;<br /><br />I rang my bank and they say there has been ample time for the funds to clear, and all account details line up. Have started a dispute but no firm assurance I&#039;ll see the money again. Has anyone else had issues with WBE?<br /><br />WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!!!!!! &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(

				&nbsp;#####UPDATE#######<br /><br />So now trading has been suspended, just saw this on the website:<br /><br />&nbsp; Trading on the exchange is currently frozen; no orders will be matched<br />Exchange Trading Frozen<br />9:10am 22-Feb-12<br /><br />I (Chris Moore) have frozen the exchange temporarily while I attempt to get in touch with the management. It appears that AUD withdrawals have been piling up in the &#039;pending&#039; state for over a week now, which is unusual. I hope there&#039;s a simple explanation for this and that I&#039;m overreacting, but until I&#039;m able to talk to Andre about this it doesn&#039;t seem fair to allow people to continue trading here.<br /><br /><br />So how the fuck do we get BC in the meantime?<br />

				Weird.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think WBX is a scam site. I&#039;ve seen threads where other Aussie SR users have mentioned using it.<br /><br />The exchange still appears to be down, and it&#039;s been several days now.<br /><br />I wonder what happened... the explanation posted on the site doesn&#039;t make much sense to me...<br /><br />Maybe they got overrun by an influx of new users migrating over after the TradeHill crash? <br /><br />It&#039;s a mystery.

				FYI, there&#039;s a new update on their News feed:<br /><br />&quot;Dear Clients, We would like to apologize to all our clients for the lack of customer support provided over the past weeks, as of 14th February we have been faced with another banking institution issue, which includes the following; We&#039;ve had an account suspension issue with our Commonwealth bank processing account and are unable to execute EFT AUD withdrawals while the account is suspended. We will leave the exchange in its &#039;frozen&#039; state until we are able to re-commence operations. We&#039;ve had an issue or two in the past with other banking institutions in Australia so we understand the tension this causes for customers and ourselves. However we&#039;ve always managed to correct them. We thank you for your support and appreciate your patience as we work through this. WBX Team&quot;<br /><br />What does this mean exactly? Are the banks getting pissed off and suspicious about BTC transactions and just freezing exchangers&#039; accounts?

				They have had several account freezes from the bank, according to their news feed. All seems dodgy as fuck. My money is now showing as a &quot;pending&quot; deposit but I can&#039;t access it until the site is restored. No answer to emails as to when or if they will be back online. How are other Aussies buying coins? I used a wire transfer to Mt. Gox but paid fuckloads in fees, how else can we buy BTC now?

				I feel your pain, I deposited after the site was frozen! Didn&#039;t think to check for problems.&nbsp; This is the second time I am using wbx, the first was a slow and tedious exchange but I thought it would get better.<br />I gave spendbitcoins a try and couldn&#039;t believe how much easier it was. Thats how buying bitcoins should be done.&nbsp; Fingers crossed this wbx issue clears up soon!

				From the news tab on WBX:<br /><br /><br />Dear Clients, Again we would like to apologize to all our clients for the delayed customer support provided over the past weeks, Effective immediately 15th March World Bitcoin Exchange (WBX) will be shutting down trading / deposits and returning all client funds. Due to increasing fraudulent transactions on our accounts, WBX cannot operate in its current capacity. Combined with multiple bank account closures, we have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and return funds<br /><br />As of the 20th of March we will start returning all clients BTC, we currently hold the majority of our BTC off line, which is managed by Chris Moore our Technical lead, you will be required to logon to your account and request a BTC Withdraw to your personal wallets.<br /><br />The withdraw of AUD is on hold until we have a clear indication when FUNDS are returned by our bank.<br /><br />We appreciate your patience. WBX Team <br /><br />What the fuck this is supposed to mean in terms of when we can get our money back I have no idea, but I know they don&#039;t give a fuck about customer service and even if they resumed trading I would never use the shifty cunts again.
