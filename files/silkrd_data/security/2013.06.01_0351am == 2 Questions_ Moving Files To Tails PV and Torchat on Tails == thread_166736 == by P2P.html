				I have two questions to ask of those who are actively using tails for most of their needs:<br /><br />1. How can I move files from a TrueCrypt encrypted USB to tails? <br /><br />2. Is there a way to get torchat on tails? And if not, does this mean torchat is inherently insecure?

				When you get to the tails boot screen (the screen where you can choose &quot;Live&quot; or &quot;Live (failsafe)&quot;), press the tab button on your keyboard. <br /><br />At the bottom of your screen you will see some writing that ends with &quot;quiet&quot;<br /><br />Press &lt;spacebar&gt; and type &quot;truecrypt&quot; (without quotes) and press enter.<br /><br />When you are at your tails desktop go to Application/Accessories/Truecrypt<br /><br />You can now decrypt your USB drive and move the files to your persistents partition (assuming you have created one)<br /><br />When it comes to Torchat i can&#039;t really help you but i believe the Tails devs left it out for a reason. As far as I know Torchat is junk (according to some well respected forums members here) and isn&#039;t really that safe. I&#039;m sure there are guides to installing it on your persistents partition but i wouldn&#039;t bother. I&#039;m sure in future Tails releases they will include bitmessage when it becomes more established.<br /><br />Hope that helps

				Excellent. That is exactly what I was looking for. And yes I had that feeling about torchat. No harm done.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got another 2 questions now, though.<br /><br />After moving everything (copy+paste is all I was able to do. For some reason you can&#039;t drag/drop in tails?) to my persistent volume, I now cannot delete things from my Truecrypt mounted USB. Also, certain things that I did delete I cannot empty out of my trash can. It just simply says that it cannot delete the file. Is there a way around this? I was thinking maybe just move my files to the amnesia folder and see what happens, but I&#039;m not sure if that folder is encrypted or not (I sure did not encrypt it) and I need all files to be forensically secure.
