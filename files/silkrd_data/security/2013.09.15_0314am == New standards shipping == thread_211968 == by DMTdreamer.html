				I believe it is now the time to discuss the shipping of SR. Almost every vendor ships exactly the same way. Out of 1000 packages I can easily pick out SR packages. (this is only packages not letters) <br /><br />Almost every SR package look the same. I&#039;m not going to give out details but some vendors are getting picked off because the packages look the same. <br /><br />I have some many ideas on how to change this but I&#039;m not sure if I should post this out in public.... maybe a moderator can PM me. <br /><br />USPS postal sorting facilities are starting to get smart with how to spot SR packages.... <br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t post it in public, let the cops buy off you if they&#039;re interested at least you&#039;ll make money instead of handing them intel for free :P<br /><br />Every vendor should be ordering a variety of commercial non illegal shit online to inspect the packaging and then mimic it for their narco shipments by either using online shops that sell custom mylar printing and graphics, or custom boxes and keep switching up the companies. That&#039;s all you have to do. <br />

				Please don&#039;t talk about this. Yes we know this is happening. Yes the police and posties are working together and can easily pick out SR packages. Unfortunately trying to set some sort of new standard will only give them something new to look for.<br /><br />Diversity is the key. Let&#039;s just say any vendor slipping the vac sealed baggy of weed between a piece of paper in a business letter cannot ever be called stealth. Anything thicker than 2.5mm in a regular envelope is a dead giveaway, doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s drugs or not. Only letters should go in mail envelopes.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Only letters should go in mail envelopes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I used to buy hash out of Netherlands in 2005 that was ironed/pressed flat, sealed, and then wrapped up inside a windowed envelope. There was no way to tell it was drugs, perfectly flat. If I remember correctly each envelope had 7g each. Some of the shit I see on the news of Australian post intercepted drug letters are pretty bad, half-assed packaging<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ha maybe vendors should switch to that method then. Better then what 80% of vendors use for domestic currently.<br /><br />Seriously though at least Australian customs have been cracking down much harder lately, UK and US probably as well. Doesn&#039;t matter so much about outside appearence when they have x-ray vision
