				First off, I apologize in advance if this has already been touched on in another thread, I really wasn&#039;t able to find anything with basic searches<br />If I were to have two orders on the way domestically, and another two from the other side of the pond, would that raise any red flags? Or am I just being paranoid...<br />Time to go dig out the old tinfoil hat.<br />

				Don&#039;t fret man, I&#039;ve had 6 orders in transit at once before and all came though without a hitch.<br /><br />Think of it this way, if you had a bunch of orders from amazon, ebay, etc coming to you, would anyone think twice?&nbsp;

				Ha yeah, 6 was kind overkill, but it was all &quot;personal amounts&quot; from different vendors.&nbsp; So even if they caught one of my packages it wouldn&#039;t be worth the effort to track down all my other mail.&nbsp; Come to think of it one of the orders was for Xanny&nbsp; ;).&nbsp; I once had 3 orders arrive sooner than expected while I was on vacation, and they ended up sitting at the post office for 2 days, when I went to pick up my mail the post man told me I had &quot;a bundle of gifts&quot;, if he only knew haha...

				I get a bunch of mixed domestic and foreign mail. Honestly, I think the only people who care are the customs officials sorting through packages randomly. And then they only really care if the mailer wasn&#039;t stealth enough in their packaging methods, or something was ripped open by their machinery and exposed some interesting contents.

				I&#039;ve received from The Netherlands and Germany on the same day. Nowadays I wouldn&#039;t risk it, but it&#039;s probably no big deal whatsoever.
