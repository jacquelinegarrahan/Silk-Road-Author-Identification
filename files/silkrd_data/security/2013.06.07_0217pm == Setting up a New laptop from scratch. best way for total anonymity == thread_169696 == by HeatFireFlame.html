				Hi all, So im getting a new laptop soon. Need some advice on how to set it up from scratch for total anonymity. Now im pretty good with security just no expert. <br />Il have a USB with tails and a persistent volume. Im going to have Linux as the operating system. Of course the latest tor package. Is there anything else anyone can add to this that would be great for security. I always use PGP encryption etc as well just for the record. <br /><br />Just wondering if there would be anything i should/could do seeing as the laptop will be completely clean and brand new before i start using it for SR stuff. The way i have it already is fine on this, but i want to make it extra secure if possible. <br /><br />thanks all =D

				You can find a tutorial on whonix here : www.sourceforge.net/projects/whonix/&nbsp; it&#039;s also where you download it. Everything on how to customize it is said there but it&#039;s really long so it will take some time. There&#039;s also really good security guideline there that aren&#039;t specific to whonix.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169696.msg1210410#msg1210410">Quote from: jokerman2000 on June 07, 2013, 03:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would get a SSD with full disk encryption, Thunderbird with Enigmail for pgp secured email communications,I2P (Invisible Internet Project), Tor, and the proxychains open source software packages. TrueCrypt and GNUPG for encryption.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t really know why an SSD is more secure than an HDD, from what I&#039;ve heard you should encrypt your SSD as soon as you start using it because it&#039;s not possible to completely erase anything from an SSD, even if you use the gutmann method, so that would make it less secure. If you encrypt it as soon as you have it, why would it be more secure?

				Does anyone know about how virtual box and/or whonix uses swap space? I ask because I think this might be an issue for machines with the hard disk still connected. On a linux host you could run sudo swapoff -a and again on whonix but I&#039;m not sure this would entirely stop whonix.<br /><br />tree, I think it would think that it is because once encrypted a single pass overwrite would mean that all that could be recovered was encrypted garbage (since used and empty space is indistinguishable). That seems inarticulate but I personally blame the late hour (and possibly the tail end of the ketamine....). I&#039;ll try to tidy it up tomorrow.

				Setup Ubuntu with FDE, and have all your data secondarily encrypted using TrueCrypt.<br /><br />For your internet buy a burner phone that you can tether to the computer so even your internet provider doesn&#039;t know who you are, or use a wireless dongle brought with cash. For secondary protection use a privateinternetaccess VPN for all Clearnet browsing. Use Whonix for anything related to Silk Road.<br /><br />I recommend using Gpg4Usb for your PGP encryption on Ubuntu as it&#039;s simple to set up and use.

				Thanks everyone, sorry i didnt write back sooner had some issues IRL to deal with over the last couple of days. <br /><br />some really great ideas and i appreciate you all helping out. Laptop is ordered anyway and should be here within a week or so, not sure though as postage is never truly reliable. <br />When it does get here il basically post a recap of what im going to do and let you all know , it would be great if someone said &quot;yeah thats what to do&quot; or &quot;no heres why not to do it&quot; type thing. <br /><br />Il be sure to start checking out all the links you have provided around now so that im prepared type thing. Cheers all speak soon<br />Hff
