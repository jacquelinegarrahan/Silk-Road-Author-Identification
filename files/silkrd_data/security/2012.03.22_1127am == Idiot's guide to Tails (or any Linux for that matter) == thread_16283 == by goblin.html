				Hi, I&#039;m writing from the perspective of someone who&#039;s always been in the clutches of Microsoft, for better or worse. I know that Linux is just great for security and apparently the best is Tails.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve been confronted by the to me bewildering facade of different Linuxes, and put off by the intinidating (not to mention a bit percious) names of applications in it, and even worse the prospect of doing command line functions and even writing scripts, etc.<br /><br />Is there a Linux for dummies website or even better one for Tails?<br /><br />Thanks heaps.

				Personally I think Liberte is better than Tails from a security point of view but that is another argument altogether.<br /><br />Install Ubuntu or Debian and use it as your main OS for a while, the best way to learn is by doing.<br /><br />There are many many good forums for Linux users, and members can be very helpful to noobs, but the particular flavour of Linux you choose will determine which forums you frequent.<br /><br />I can help you out with any specific questions that you may have, I am a long term Linux user and can help you from the security standpoint also.
