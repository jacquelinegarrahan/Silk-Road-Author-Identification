				Evenin&#039; all!<br /><br />It has been suggested to me <br />that using a &quot;virtual machine&quot; <br />might be safer.<br /><br />My question comes in two parts. <br /><br />== First part ==<br /><br />I have a computer that runs Windows 7. <br />Before you boo, hiss, or spit at me, <br />please be assured that I understand <br />the error of my ways. <br /><br />I would like to be able to have a <br />Linux-Ubuntu OS installed on my <br />computer that runs independently<br />of my computer and its hard drive.<br /><br />How could I have a virtual <br />Linux-Ubuntu machine <br />on my current computer <br />without having to delete Windows?<br /><br />== Second part ==<br /><br />If I were to implement such a device, <br />then just how traceable would it be?<br /><br />Let&#039;s assume that someone who wanted <br />to know my business confiscated my <br />computer one day. What access would<br />&nbsp;they have to my virtual machine?<br /><br />It seems that having a computer running <br />Windows and Linux in parallel is as safe<br />as having two separate computers in the <br />same room. (Not safe at all!)<br /><br />How do I get a truly anonymous <br />virtual machine running on my laptop <br />without having to wipe Windows?!

				Easiest thing to do is probably to put your Linux installation on a bootable, encrypted USB drive.&nbsp; Don&#039;t even let any of your SR dealings ever touch your laptop hard drive.&nbsp; Then, if someone gets ahold of your machine, you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; If someone gets ahold of your USB drive, well, really, that&#039;s probably OK, too, since it&#039;s protected by full-disk encryption.

If you&#039;re really paranoid you can wipe your drive 7 times, sure it might take some time but it&#039;ll completely erase everything off your drive, it&#039;ll be impossible for them recover your data after that many wipes.

				Hi there,<br /><br />You could try using Oracle VM Virtualbox. I have used this program to run my Linux OS on my Windows 7 PC. I would think that installing the program on a USB drive and installing your Linux on the USB drive would be your best bet. Virtualbox is also very easy to use and is very reliable. Encrypting the USB or password protecting it wouldn&#039;t hurt either!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />The Godfather

				VMs are great for a vendor who has to print labels. I don&#039;t use Windows exploitable O/S, but my printers require it. Pirate any old windows edition and load it in a VM, afterwards encrypt the .VDI snapshot. No history anywhere of previously printed addresses..<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If the OP is still looking for info, they might enjoy perusing http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/polyfront.html . It is a bit of a tutorial and informational site put together by the admin of the OVDB community (RIP).

				I am not dead. I also no longer suggest that you use virtual machines in this way. Yes, it is a huge benefit to have firefox isolated away from Tor and external IP addresses. However, virtual machines are much easier to pwn than operating systems running on real hardware. If your virtual machine is easy to pwn, the attacker will just hack it and spy on your address as plaintext to deanonymize you, rather than breaking out of the VM after pwning firefox and getting your IP address to deanonymize you. And most people who are using virtual machines are not even using them in a way that offers any real security advantage, they are just running Tor and everything else in one VM. Xen seems better in some ways than virtualbox, it is used by Qubes after all and I do not think the person who made Qubes has no idea what they are doing, although Theo of OpenBSD fame and some other security researchers have said less than favorable things about the technique of isolating with virtual machines. However, even if the isolation by Xen approach is not inherently flawed, Xen lacks ASLR so even if it is less additionally vulnerable to being hacked than virtual box, you are still not going to be able to take advantage of all of the security of using real hardware. So in general, I believe in the majority of cases virtual machines should simply be entirely avoided. The only exception I would maybe make to this is using jails from FreeBSD.<br /><br />Right now I am split between two techniques for isolating firefox and other non-tor network facing applications away from Tor and each other. The first would be to run Tor on one dedicated machine and firefox on another, then use a physical wire to connect them and route the firefox machines traffic through the Tor machine and Tor. This will give the exact same benefits as using virtual machines to accomplish this, without any of the disadvantages of virtual machines. The second technique is using SElinux sandbox for x level isolation and then writing a SElinux profile to prevent firefox from gaining access to external IP address in any way or doing geopositioning. Certainly using the two machines approach is a more all encompassing and foolproof solution though. Additionally, these techniques can be combined for a very high degree of isolation. Failing that you may still choose to use virtual machine based isolation, and it will certainly give you benefits, just be aware that it comes at a high cost and in some use cases the cost could actually nullify the benefits. I think for servers it is more suited than for people using firefox, but it still has the same disadvantages.

				Yes if you have an air gap between your private keys / passphrases / plaintexts and the internet , I would still suggest using a virtual machine as a viable option. You essentially increase the risk that an attacker will be able to take total control of the VM while decreasing the risk that an attacker will be able to gain access to the host environment, versus having no additional isolation between applications and the host. It is pretty apparent that using Virtualbox isolation is adequate to protect somewhat from the feds, considering it saved the ass of freedom hosting...but using physical hardware isolation or a proper mandatory access control profile is probably closer to the &#039;correct&#039; way of accomplishing this regardless.

It is a detailed step-by-step guide installing a virtual machine&nbsp; in a secret partition made with TrueCrypt, using Oracle Virtual Box for Windows. The link is: http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/paste/show.php?id=d1d879e959bcc020 <br />The author even gives instructions on how to download and install everything!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have a spare laptop that will be used ONLY for the purpose of browsing privately online.&nbsp; Everything has been completely wiped &amp; a striped down version of win7 home reinstalled and only a few select programs downloaded discretely.&nbsp; <br /><br />How does the approach Nakorx linked to compare to using Liberte on a usb ?&nbsp; Instead of just using a USB stick, the laptop becomes the usb stick with a monitor &amp; internet access - completely mobile. (And disposable if necessary.)<br /><br />I have Liberte downloaded, but also 3/4 of the way through the install in the link that Nakorx posted.&nbsp; It does seem like a very secure setup, (goes beyond just surfing web anonymously)&nbsp; just not sure how it compared to Liberte?<br /><br />It requires to download Ubuntu, (which I&#039;m familiar with) but was going to install Liberte in place of Ubuntu, but it seems I&#039;ve hit a snag as the version of Liberte is strictly for the USB &amp; doesn&#039;t have the live cd?&nbsp; (I downloaded Liberte using the link in the main Sticky in the Security forum of how to browse SR anonymously)<br /><br />Is there a LiveCD version of Liberte I can run in place of Ubuntu on a VM for the highlest level of security &amp; encryption?<br /><br />Can it even work like that?

Plug it out, evidence gone. If it is discovered you can put in a false partition, after all you don&#039;t need much space to work with at all. That gives you plausible denability.<br /><br />Also, look into using a MicroSD. I like these because they&#039;re super easy to hide, they&#039;re about the size of your fingernail but they can contain 32 Gb or so in memory whilst being fairly cheap.<br /><br />This (USB or MicroSD) beats the crap out of having to get rid of an entire laptop if a possy of LE came through the front door.<br /><br />As for your other question, I haven&#039;t done it with Liberte myself, but I see no reason why you shouldn&#039;t be able to use Liberte as a virtual machine. I don&#039;t understand where there is a problem, I suspect you are trying it with the wrong version or something. There&#039;s a burnable ISO image version of Liberte on the website for you to download, that should work.<br />&nbsp;
