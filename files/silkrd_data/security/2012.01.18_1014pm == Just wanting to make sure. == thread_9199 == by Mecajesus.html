				I was just curious if your bitcoin address is the address under the tab &quot;Receive coins&quot; in your bitcoin wallet, since i can&#039;t really seem of any other place it could be.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m just double checking before i order any.<br /><br />EDIT: Also wondering if it&#039;s a bad idea to send directly to your house (In this case my apartment). I&#039;m most likely going to anyways, due to the fact that i lack a PO box. I would just like SR&#039;s input.

				Yep that your bitcoin address. You can test by going to http://freebitcoins.appspot.com . They give away 0.005 of a bitcoin to each visitor (youll need to sign in with a google account). Good way of verifying everything works.<br /><br />I&#039;d get a PO box. That&#039;s what I use, and it&#039;s worked well. Theyre dirt cheap. Some people think it&#039;s a bad idea, but it can&#039;t be worse than shipping directly to your home.<br /><br />If anything ever was intercepted, most likely you will just get a love letter the first time around. But regardless, you dont want your apartment involved... I&#039;ve heard a story by a guy who got busted for possession, and the cop let him go, but had to inform his apartment&#039;s leasing office. If this happened to you, even though you may dodge a legal bullet, the apartment complex could still very well evict you.<br /><br />Besides, to me a PO box is just cleaner anyway. Thats just that many less hands the package will need to pass through. Plus that nervous walk into the PO is better than living in constant nervousness about what might happen at your home. Just my opinion.

				I&#039;ll most likely get a PO box if i become a frequent buyer, going to send my first purchase directly to my apartment, i don&#039;t see any harm in that. <br /><br />And thanks for the help.

Unless somehow you can prove that you use the box for legitimate purposes (i.e you own a business or recieve business mail) you might be in trouble.

				@FiveSeven. I see, for now i&#039;m still going to use my address.<br /><br />My last concern was Mt. Gox, is it REALLY that risky to use? I&#039;ve already transferred money into my dwolla account and i&#039;m not certain if it is compatible with get-bitcoin or my-bitcoin for i haven&#039;t looked into that site yet.
