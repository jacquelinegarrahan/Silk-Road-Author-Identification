				Hi!<br /><br />If you login to the mtgox website, go to funding options and change the method to GBP Deposit (UK) all the relevant bank details are below, but be sure to include the message when you deposit your money otherwise they dont know why to send the money too!<br /><br />ps, you wont be able to access mtgox though tor.

				Yes, you can pay go into any Barclays bank and pay it into Mt Gox account and sort code but you need to ask the cashier to use YOUR reference number (as you do when you pay in online) whatever that may be.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need IBAN&#039;s or SWIFTBICS<br /><br />If/when the cashier asks you what you are doing just say you are paying for something from the net.<br /><br />NM

				Yes it usually takes the guys at mtgox about 2 days to put your money into your profile. Because its in japan they usually end up transferring it at about 1-4am GMT. <br /><br />However if you deposit on the weekend they won&#039;t do it until monday. Even friday night, it&#039;ll still take until monday.

				Make sure you tell the cashier to put the reference as all capital letters, Mt Gox have some automated system that reads the ref and shuttles it to the right account, but lower case letters don&#039;t work, so then you&#039;ve got to email them. Whenever I do email though, they always get back to me quickly.<br />Once I put in cash at 9am, had the money in my account 1am the next day, so get it in early if you can!
