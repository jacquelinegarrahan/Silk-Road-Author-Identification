				Forgive me, I&#039;m sort of a novice but I don&#039;t understand why SR doesn&#039;t use SSL? which this ensure better security between the exit node and the vender? I always use GPG but there are just so many people who don&#039;t on this website.

				Yea but the exit node has no encryption so wouldn&#039;t SSL prevent man in the middle attacks to steal addresses?

				i could be wrong but isn&#039;t every connection you make to each node in the tor circuit an ssl connection?

				So we do we use GPG if there is no exit node? <br /><br />Hmm it seems I know much less about how all this works than I thought.

				Let say that one of the vendors that you have been dealing with gets busted, and woe be them, they left their Silk Road account logged in or stores the messages somewhere else (encrypted of course). Now, if you send your addresses and messages to them in clear text Leo could easily read them as a bed side story. On the other hand, if you encrypt them using GPG, they have to get vendors private key and passphrase first.
