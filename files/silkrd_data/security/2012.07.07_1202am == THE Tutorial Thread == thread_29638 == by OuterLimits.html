But it would be nice to have one clear cut guide for mac, windows, linux in one place. it doesnt have to go over every single little thing. it just needs to to tell them what to do in a straight forward and easy to understand way. something that can be edited as well, eg if there is a follow up question from a user about the guide, edit the guide then to include the answer or make it more clear. sometimes its not the guide or technique but the words we choose to describe it that confuses people. anyway, cheers to everyone. thank you OuterLimits you&#039;re an asset to the community. and you know where to find me if you want any help on that <br />

				thanks sexywax and vlad.<br /><br />The pgp tutorials looked really good but I ran into a major roadblock early. still not sure what I was doing wrong but there was no &quot;gpa.exe&quot; anywhere on my computer after downloading gpg4win suite with and without kleopatra, then with, then without about 15 times. Looked for little things I might not have clicked on. I think the issue was that I had no ms word or libreoffice stuff loaded on my computer. Still don&#039;t know if that was it but I saw that others had a similar problem but couldn&#039;t help me fix it early. I spent 20 hours or so over 6wks trying to get it right. bought a bunch of stuff without encryption and realize that I was taking a bigger risk by doing that. <br />Have a different issue with setting up tormail and thunderbird.&nbsp; may try that again if you guys post a tutorial about this. by the way, the tutorials with the screen shots are extraordinarily time consuming to follow: if there is a way to do it in one long post, I think that would be easier (unless there is a max word limit for posts?)<br />by the way, I finally got pgp up and running.<br /><br />I owe so many +1&#039;s to you security guys. Can&#039;t wait till I can give that karma.<br /><br />dagoof

				How many tutorial threads do we need? <br /><br />OuterLimits, I respect what you&#039;re trying to do here. But the answer to every conceivable question is already on the forums or on the Wiki.

				I created a step-by-step guide on how to install Mobile Tor and configure everything in iOS. You must have a jailbroken iOS device for this to work. This allows you to route traffic for all applications over the Tor network. This can allow you to use other applications such as IRC client etc over Tor and not just a web browser like you are limited to with the Onion Browser application.<br /><br />http://x35jfacrznhhtrfr.onion/tutorials/tor-ios/

				For all the Mac OS X users, I have created a very detailed step-by-step guide that includes screenshots for every step on how to configure Adium to connect to the Silk Road IRC chat through Tor.<br /><br />Adium is basically the Mac version of Pidgin, it uses the same core &quot;libpurple&quot; that Pidgin uses for most protocols. This guide also covers how to configure the Tor Browser Bundle for Mac to use the same SOCKS port everytime you launch it instead of a random port, so that you only have to setup this configuration one time.<br /><br />Check it out:<br /><br />http://x35jfacrznhhtrfr.onion/tutorials/mac/chat/

I respectfully disagree and think that security tutorials in multiple places and pitched to multiple levels of computer expertise are essential and not overkill. I appreciate this thread and enjoy the high-end security expert flame threads that battle about codes, weird old languages, server vulnerabilities and the like are necessary too (to keep the guys on the other end of the learning curve sharp). I still need practice with the a b c&#039;s and appreciate those willing to figure out what it is that I don&#039;t understand and not flame me.
