Also vendors that sell other products do this same shit. My first order on SR i was selectively scammed by one of the top vendors. i understand why they do it, a noob is shitting razor blades with fear on the first order, and i would guess a large number assume the order got seized and never go back to SR again, therefore it makes sense for an unscrupulous vendor to try to maximize profit any way they can. This was one of the top vendors, they still are and still talk the same goody, goody shit they did 17 months ago. Good Luck

				I have also been stung with this to the tune of around 1400GBP or 170BTC at the time.<br />Dude called Sullyyy - he had made at least one account and gave himself great feedback and reviews. He also used another &quot;legitimate&quot; account though which he must have used for some time before planning to scam, that was what got me to bite the bullet.<br />I should have realised because he had sold two custom listings to the other account he had and mentioned the name in the listing so it would show up on his feedback page. Total asshole.<br />I think he got around 5K GBP at least and this was only a week or so ago.<br />
