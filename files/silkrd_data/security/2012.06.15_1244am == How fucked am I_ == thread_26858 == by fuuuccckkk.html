				I was rushing to get my order done and in the process I forgot to encrypt the address. It&#039;s not mine but it is someone who generously agreed to letting me mail something to their house (even though they don&#039;t know what it is) under their name. It was for a personal size bag of cannabis. How much should I be worrying about this? It&#039;s someone I care about.

				Don&#039;t send it to your friend&#039;s house that&#039;s rude&nbsp; :D. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, if you ordered from a vendor with good reviews then you should be okay. The reason why vendors yell at you to encrypt your address is so that if SR were to ever get compromised all the perpetrators would have are encrypted addresses instead of plain text.

				If you live in the US, well then expect the DEA to be busting down your friends door within 72 hours. Sorry bro, but they&#039;re fucked for 7-10 years if you catch my drift. ;)

SR erases once the vendor reads it. encrypting is just another layer of protection. before yes there was a glitch when someone could read someone elses order and see the address but SR took care of it.
