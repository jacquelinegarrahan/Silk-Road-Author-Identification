				Maybe some of you guys can offer guidance and assistance. <br /><br />Using Mac OS X. Can&#039;t boot to tails via USB, so have the following: <br /><br />Log into VPN setup through Private Tunnel (for verification, checked IP addy and confirmed VPN working)<br />Start Parallels<br />Boot into Tails<br />Now have TOR obviously as well. <br /><br />Few questions here. <br />How protected am I? I can assume that since my computer is connected through VPN then started tails, that it&#039;s running through VPN as well? <br /><br />Obviously a downside is that I cannot have a persistent state in parallels. Now, I have my tormail addy&nbsp; and various other addys memorized. What I don&#039;t, I have in an email to myself on tormail. Nothing downloads to my computer, nothing is bookmarked, nada. Obviously, whenever you boot tails, it&#039;s just like from scratch. If shit ever hits the fan, provable is that I have a VPN, Parallels and Tails that is equipped with tails, but nothing to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that anything is connected to any illicit activities. <br /><br />The main key piece I see missing is my PGP, which I am still trying to completely figure out, so not sure if it&#039;s through OS X i setup or if it has to be within tails. <br /><br />Anyways...how many of my bases do I have covered? How safe am I from snooping eyes now and snooping eyes should a bad day ever come...

				I&#039;ve never gotten tails to successfully boot from a USB stick, even on my Hackintosh.<br /><br />But why the insistence on tails? I feel like the TOR browser bundle, running on top of a VPN should be plenty secure. <br /><br />As for local storage, I&#039;d just keep the TOR bundle and all my related files and notes (account info etc.) that you don&#039;t want to have to remember stored in an encrypted sparsebundle volume.

				I can&#039;t recall which program it is that I am using on the bootloader...I&#039;d have to reboot and look to know for sure. <br /><br />Samesamebutdifferent: Are you doing the C button or the command button? Reboot the computer and when it does the startup sound, press command and it should put you into bootloader. At least, that&#039;s how mine does. <br /><br />I can refresh bootloader and I see the USB...I go to boot from it, and the screen goes black and up in the upper right hand corner there&#039;s a blinking cursor, where it would say &quot;loading&quot; at any other time. I have let it just sit there and nothing happens. <br /><br />Maybe I missed a step somewhere. Not like there is an perfect step-by-step tutorial on this, so gathering info from different places and putting it all together. Ultimately, I would like to get the mac itself just to boot tails from the usb of course. I have not yet attempted to use a DVD. However, I am guessing that I wouldn&#039;t have a persistent volume with it either which is kinda/sorta where I am at now anyways. <br /><br />Mentioned above in one of the replies, what are the vulnerabilties with the current setup that I have? I am only accessing Silk Road and TorMail (and possibly privnote) within Tails on the Virtual Machine that&#039;s passing through the VPN. Nothing is being stored on the computer memory at all (passwords, keys, urls, nada). <br /><br /><br />Also of note and on the subject of Tails...I do have a Tails w/ volume usb. I borrowed a friends computer to get it all loaded up and it&#039;s working fine on his (windows), but I do have a question about that also: When I went to boot, it was asking about persistence. That&#039;s kind of a giveaway to LE if you ever get busted with the USB and they figure it out, they will know that SOMETHING is on that USB, no? Guess that&#039;s just a little paranoia on my behalf, as I understand how difficult it would be for them to even think about cracking it, but to me, opens up a few more questions and stares vs having a VPN and Tails installed on your computer, but no saved data on the computer, period. <br /><br />Also, wouldn&#039;t hurt to note that I never have any plans of becoming a vendor, however, I do anticipate doing a substantial amount of shipping transactions with a few select vendors.

				Well I checked this morning and I am actually using refind.
