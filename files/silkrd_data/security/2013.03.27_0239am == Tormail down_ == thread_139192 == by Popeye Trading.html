				Thank god I found this thread. I was freaking out just about to post this,<br />&quot;I emailed myself four 500$ Moneypaks. I threw away the physical cards knowing they were saved in tormail.<br />Now for the last day I keep getting this same error, <br />&quot;ERROR: Connection dropped by IMAP server.&quot;<br />It won&#039;t let me log into tormail!!!! I was supposed to send someone the 2000$ earlier today. Am I fucked?<br />Someone please I beg you help me.&quot;<br /><br />I really hope tormail is up soon because if not.... Well bad things are going to happen to me.

				It&#039;s anonymous and free so maybe we shouldn&#039;t crucify them for the down time- Okay fine but I am loosing tons of sales every time it happens so they need to at least acknowledge when it goes down, give an estimate of when it will come back online, explain why it is happening 2-3 times weekly all the sudden, and maybe offer to forward incoming to a different address on a different service in the downtime if possible.<br /><br />Is there some way to make an email address that is actually multiple addresses hosted by multiple servers?&nbsp; So someone sends to lets say fakeaddress123@sendingeverywhere.com and it forwards the message to tormail and five other addresses... then if the sendingeverywhere.com server is down it&#039;s okay because it went to another called alsosendseverywhere.com which is hosted on totally seperate servers...?? does anything remotely like this exist or has anyone got a viable solution?&nbsp; I have had three of my providers go down in the past month so it is getting to be a big issue for my clear web businesses.

				It&#039;ll likely come back for a while before it goes down again.&nbsp; At one point they had it fully operable for almost a week but sometimes it&#039;s only an hour or two.&nbsp; I imagine one of these times it will not come back to life again at all just as so many other sites in the past.

				Actually it probably could be managed. Just remove it from the main site and restrict membership to Silk Roaders. Or have it open membership if you like. &#039;silkroad.com&#039; is just an EXAMPLE of a name, could change it to something else a little more subtle to drop the connection here. Only problem is funding. Silk Road mgt are spendthrift beyond belief. They probably wouldn&#039;t back it if it meant cost.<br /><br />At least it&#039;s an idea to develop, which is more than some around here do on the forums. TorMail is shot at the knees.
