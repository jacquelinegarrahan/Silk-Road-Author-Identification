				hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve also fallen into the Dwolla&gt;Mt.Gox issue. I only deposited 20 dollars, though. I don&#039;t really have much to worry about, but I did send Dwolla my driver&#039;s license and got authorized. I did not get verified by Mt. Gox because I felt that would be a bad idea. But, I made one stupid error- I used my authentic e-mail to send help request to Mt. Gox. This is before I checked out the forums over here. It shouldn&#039;t be too much of a problem because I know that bitcoins are untrackable, and since I haven&#039;t verified myself at mt. gox, things should be quite alright. <br /><br />But, regardless, my main concern is: Should I get verified by Mt. Gox? <br /><br />I find it the easiest way for me to get my bitcoins funded into SR. Going out to a random bank just seems far too suspicious. Banks are loaded with cameras, and it seems as though I still have greater anonymity online, especially through Tor. <br /><br />Has anyone here also gotten verified through Mt. Gox? <br /><br />How has the process been for you? <br /><br />I&#039;ve read the manual, and I understand BitInstant is another way, but I&#039;m trying to avoid that because it requires me having to go to a bank. Also, be honest- did I fuck up anywhere?<br /><br />So far, I haven&#039;t made any purchases. Actually, I put in an order back in January, but my shipment never made it to my house because they were international. I decided to try SR again a few days ago, and I bumped into the whole Dwolla&gt;Mt. Gox verification fiasco. I know it&#039;s too early to really say anything, but what are your thoughts? Time to just jump ship and find another bitcoin client?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I was also caught up in this whole Dwolla-Mt.Gox issue. I verified myself on both sites because I deposited $100 and wanted to see that money again. What I&#039;m planning on doing is just buying moneypaks and trading them for btc using a vendor. It seems faster and more anonymous, but I could be completely wrong.

				I use Mt. Gox. I&#039;ve never had any problems. You don&#039;t have to give any information to anyone. You just hand over the automated deposit slip (it already has all the account info on it) and the exact change, and that is it. No need to give any personal info. I&#039;ve never used Dwolla, but I believe they require that you verify your identity with them, via driver&#039;s license #, ect, which I am not comfortable with.<br /><br />Try going through Mt. Gox and using the Cash Deposit option. It&#039;s super easy and takes very little time.<br /><br />sdesu

Users who want to send money Dwolla--&gt;mtgox need to be verified by sending mtgox your government issued ID and proof of residency (utility bill).<br /><br />I sent money and I do not want to send ID, so I just had to kiss my money goodbye. But if you don&#039;t mind giving up your info to a company that has openly said they will cooperate with authorities, dwolla--&gt;mtgox should still be a very convenient method for you.

				Be certain that any bank deposit slips you may hold in hand you give to them holding between your fingers or wearing gloves.&nbsp; No finger prints needed ever.<br /><br />Do not be one of those people that go by the odds of something happening my friends. It may be a million to one it is ever checked or used for evidence against you but people win the lottery every week at&nbsp; much longer odds&nbsp; so make sure you have that contingency prepared for.<br /><br />&quot;Discretion is always the better part of valor&quot;

				I verified so I could get my money back.&nbsp; I decided against putting the $ on SR as I had originally intended, and now I&#039;m trying to wirthdraw from Mt Gox and it&#039;s taking a long ass time. I&#039;ve found a better, easier way to get BTC. I&#039;m somewhat worried that they have my info, but I&#039;m not going to sweat it. What are they gonna do, bust down my door over 7g of weed?

				They don&#039;t always bust down your door for the drug you have or the crime you may have committed they may be busting down your door to get to your BRAIN and&nbsp; any information you may have to assist them. Ask yourself do you know anyone in high places or anyone who is involved in drugs&nbsp; &nbsp;high enough to where he is making massive amounts of cash? Id you do and they know you are in tight with that person then hell yes be worried.

				In my email this morning:<br /><br />Dear XXXXXXXXXX,<br /><br />Following the announcement from Dwolla regarding a change in their user policy, we are now obliged to institute Dwollaâ€™s AML requirements for any Mt.Gox customer who uses Dwolla as a transfer method.<br /><br />Effective from Friday 25th of May, any user using Dwolla via Mt.Gox will be required to own a Verified account.<br /><br />Have more than one preferred withdrawal method or own more than one bank account? Simply add them one at a time until all your preferred methods are listed in the withdrawal methods drop down.<br /><br />How do I become Verified? &quot;Verified&quot; status can be obtained by any Mt.Gox user by submitting a copy of government issued photographic identification documentation and proof of residence (utility bill, etc.) documentation via our dedicated interface.<br /><br />To submit documents you will need to log into your Mt.Gox account, go to &quot;Settings&quot; by clicking on your username in the top-left of the page and then click on &quot;Get Verified.&quot; Once the proper documentation has been submitted the process will in general take a maximum of two business days.<br /><br />A Verified account also gives you the following advantages : Being &quot;Verified&quot; allows for the following withdrawal limits: A maximum monthly withdrawal of $50,000 USD (or equivalent) capped to a maximum of $10,000 USD per 24 hrs and a 4,000 BTC withdrawal per 24 hrs without any monthly limit.<br /><br />We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this will cause our North American customers, and are working with Dwolla to reduce the impact of their AML processes on Mt.Gox users.<br /><br />Regards, <br />Mt.Gox Co. Ltd Team

				Do you need to be verified by MTG if you use the Dwolla -&gt; BitInstant -&gt; MTG method?&nbsp; Really don&#039;t want to send MTG my info, but already did with Dwolla.&nbsp;

				I got that email today as well. When I initially signed up with Mt. Gox and xfered money from Dwolla, I made the mistake of logging into Mt. Gox through Tor so I triggered something that required me to send them personal information to get authenticated or whatever they call it. I continued using it, only dealing with small amounts, 100 bucks or so. This new email though makes me think that LE is catching on that in the US at least, lots of people are using the dwolla - gox xfer to get bitcoins.<br /><br />The thing for me though. Is what does that prove? All it proves is that I turned dollars into Bitcoins. I know that they&#039;re supposed to be traceable, but I then send through a couple Easywallet&#039;s, then up to SR all through TOR. SR is supposed to tumble the coins.<br /><br />They would have to trace a bitcoin that I purchased through my dwolla-gox trade back to a vendor that I purchased something through to prove anything really.<br /><br />I could be wrong in the above statement, but even if LE knows that you&#039;re getting bitcoins, proving that you&#039;ve used them for illegal activity and exactly what illegal activity seems a bit difficult. My answer if someone came knocking would be &quot;yes I purchase bitcoins and prove that I did something illegal with them!&quot; Of course any thumb drives would be hidden and smashed.<br /><br />Am I wrong about this?
