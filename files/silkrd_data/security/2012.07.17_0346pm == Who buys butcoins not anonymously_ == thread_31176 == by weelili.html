				I was just wondering.. I don&#039;t have great possiblities of buying bitcoins in my country.<br /><br />Is it not safe enough to buy bitcoins with a verifyed (real name+real address) and then maybe put them through bitcoin fog?<br /><br /><br />This is what I&#039;d do:<br />Create a mt.gox account and verify it on my usual computer+internet line at home. Buy bitcoins.<br />Use Tor Browser Bundle with cache turned off on the same computer+internet and get a bitcoinfog address. Send it to SR from there.<br /><br />Not safe enough?

				Yes, buying bitcoins at MtGox and then laundering them through Bitcoin Fog is a safe method. You can also send them directly to your SR account. Before your funds go to the vendor, they will be mixed in Silk Road&#039;s own tumbler. So it will be pretty hard to trace the transaction back to you. For small purchases, you don&#039;t need to use Bitcoin Fog (although apart from the fee, it doesn&#039;t hurt. And the more people use such a service, the more secure it becomes, so you&#039;re doing a service for the BTC community).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31176.msg351354#msg351354">Quote from: StExo on July 17, 2012, 03:52 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you use that method, your own defense is somebody hacked the account, but you better have some pretty good answers as to why you bought the coins in the first place and you need to prove it wasn&#039;t you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you live in a decent country that respects basic human rights, you do not have to give any reason why you bought BTC!

Here you can exactly see all transactions.

				Alright, thanks for the info !<br />So just to feel better I could make 2 instawallets (I get a safety warning when I go to instawallet.org with Tor, thats no problem, right?) with two different Tor identities, get the BTC through them, of course not from Tor network but with my usual browser logged into MtGox, then through bitcoinfog and from there to SR and I should be safe even though the initial purchase of BTC was in my name.<br /><br /><br />Right...? Sorry for the repeated asking, I&#039;m just a bit paranoid :)

				The safest way would clearly just be sending cash in to v1ad1m1r through the post, then him sending you the coins. But as I stated in a previous thread.. I strongly doubt the majority of SR&#039;ers ordering small possession quantities of drugs, would ever be looked into that deeply should a package through the post be seized from thereon in. Using bitcoinfog is always a good idea though from what I can make out.<br /><br />I take it the idea of using BCF is that if the SR servers were to be confiscated, the BC addresses wouldn&#039;t link back to an exchange (which holds your details), but rather to a BCF address? Which would greatly reduce the chance of you being found. If someone could clarify that is the idea of using BCF I would appreciated it. Because I&#039;d imagine from the point of view of transfers FROM the exchange being investigated then there&#039;d be no real benefit of BCF as there&#039;s no way to exactly prove the bitcoins have gone to a Silkroad account, and SR having a mixer, etc. So the way I&#039;m thinking is that the only real point of BTC is protecting yourself against SR servers being confiscated at some point?

				from what i understand bitcoinfog is a mixer too.<br />bitcoins are basically strings of numbers or whatever and you send them to bitcoinfog. bitcoinfog then does not send exactly your numbers out, bit mixes them with everybody elses.<br />that way you might end up sending bitcoins from people who ordered way heavier or more stuff, but with the btc going through bitcoinfog before LE would have no way of proving the bitcoins you originally bought were used to do something illegal, at least not by you(!).

I work in a bank myself and we are obliged to file SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) for any transactions of a possibly fradulent or otherwise illegal nature.

In practice the old boy &quot;scratch my back&quot; network is still running along merrily and we much prefer to quietly supply such information than face public scrutiny of the kind to which HSBC has recently been subjected for example.<br /><br />Of course you&#039;ll say I&#039;m biased as I sell Bitcoins for cash but as I said yesterday I am supplying a demand for obtaining BTC safely - I didn&#039;t create it!<br /><br />TLDR : Police can and do view your financial information without a warrant, use cash to buy your Bitcoins!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Well, the thing is...<br />If I use bitcoinfog and im buying anonymously, they wont have a reason to come knock at my door.<br />They certainly wont search my house just because I bought bitcoins.<br />So I guess as long as they dont have a reason to think I bought drugs in the first place, I should be fine.

				Why would they have that reason Vladimir?<br /><br />I really have to agree with eJ3k1, only having obtained bitcoins cant be enough to go from &quot;someone sent you a package with drugs, doesnt have to be you who ordered it&quot; to &quot;it surely was you, you bought bitcoins and send them somewhere&quot;.<br /><br />I dont wanna waste your time, if you can convince me its riskier im going to use your service :) im pretty paranoid so im considering it anyway...<br /><br /><br />re-wording my question:<br />is the security level of:<br />using your service and at the same time buying and spending bitcoins for something else entirely (just sending them to a friend for the sake of argument)<br />and:<br />buying bitcoins non-anonymously and using a mixer<br /><br />not the same?<br /><br />in either case: we got drugs; we bought bitcoins; the payment for the drugs can not be proven.
