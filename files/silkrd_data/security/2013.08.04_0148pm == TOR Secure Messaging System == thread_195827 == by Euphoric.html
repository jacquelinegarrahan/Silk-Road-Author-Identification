More important than encryption IMO.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anonymity is the primary defense mechanism here, everything else is secondary. The best way to think of PGP/GPG is as an insurance policy -- it is there to protect you, when the shit hits the fan. About a year ago, there was a user by the name of Winters86. He claimed to come from a family of LEOs, and he claims to have seen an internal document/report that talks about Silk Road. Here is what he had to say: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4<br />Security / Australian LE Report on BC/SR<br />« on: August 26, 2012, 01:11 am »<br /><br />Hello all,<br /><br />I come from a family of LEO&#039;s, Not just uniformed officers, but upper echelon personnel in multiple agencies both state and federal. I can&#039;t be more specific than that unfortunately. Recently, I gained access to an internal confidential report distributed to several Australia LE agencies and a few international anti-narcotic bodies regarding possible methods of combating illegal activities involving BC. Of course SR was a main feature of said report.<br /><br />I was told not to share any of the information, however I feel this report should be made available to the SR community because it contained methods through which LEO intend to begin to infiltrate and if possible start serious interdiction of the quote &#039;blatant and continually growing narcotic trade SR supports&#039;. Now I can&#039;t post the report openly for everyone, because It could lead to serious consequences for myself and members of my family, I will however share the relevant points made and share an altered version of the report with a few members of the community whom I have already discussed this with and who have agreed to help get the information out there, because I know this one post won&#039;t be enough.<br /><br />So here are the nuts and bolts of the report, spread the information as far and wide as possible friends:<br /><br />1. PGP is terrifying them, every new user who learns it and helps others learn, closes a possible loophole they where planning to exploit.<br />2. User ignorance of the technology being used (Tor, PGP etc) is the their single best hope for any kind of serious action against the SR community.<br />3. Narcotic trade historically involves exploitation and violence. Users working together as a community for a greater good and towards the same goals has made all previous interdiction training basically obsolete. In other words, every user who helps newcomers learn how to be safe and secure especially through the use of PGP for all transactions and communication is a nail in LEO&#039;s coffin. <br />4. A total lack of violence and exploitation is very much working in our favor. So in other words, the idea of a community working together to protect the new and vulnerable has been identified as a huge obstacle for any kind of serious attempt to stop SR.<br />5. Their morale regarding fighting SR and BC is very low at the moment, mainly because very few LEO have the capacity to comprehend how the whole system works, but unfortunately, recent media coverage demands some kind of action, so they are going to have to show the public they are doing SOMETHING to combat SR, they just aren&#039;t sure what yet.<br /><br />So there you have it my friends, Think of it like we are involved in an Insurrection and they are trying to pacify our homeland. History dictates that a determined and unified local populace will always defeat an invading enemy, regardless of strength through slowly sapping that enemies very will to continue the fight. We have the upper hand, there are just a few things we need to do to win the war and if you have read this post, you will see what those things are.<br /><br />Go forth and educate yourself and anyone who needs it. Lean PGP, use it, teach others, encourage the spirit of community and helping others and victory shall be ours.<br />Be safe and smart friends.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.msg431562#msg431562 </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Note especially points 1 &amp; 2. PGP is terrifying them, and every user who uses Tor/PGP closes a loophole they were trying to exploit. <br /><br />Encryption makes their jobs harder, thus their fear of it.&nbsp; I well remember the Crypto Wars back in the 1990s... every police agency you could name was warning about the dangers of non-backdoored crypto. Their worst nightmare (then, and now) would be to have mass adoption of PGP -- then-FBI Director Louis Freeh was quoted as saying that this would bring online investigations to a halt. <br /><br />The two biggest assets that law enforcement have are user ignorance followed by user apathy. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
