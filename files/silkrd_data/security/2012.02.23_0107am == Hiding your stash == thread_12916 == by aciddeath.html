				[mods please delete this thread if you feel it is inappropriate for discussion]<br /><br />I always liked smuggling pills and powders inside electronics while driving around town.. It made me feel 110% at ease to have drugs inside my laptop that would still turn on<br />Inside of my house I keep pills and powders tucked inside of a false plant hook in the ceiling and as well in a one of those pieces that screws into a light bulb socket but allows you to plugin electrical cords to it (in lieu of a lightbulb)<br /><br />Anyone care to share their ingenious stash spots?<br />

				I will probably never use this so I guess it wouldn&#039;t hurt to share. Hollowing out a door from the top and making a cover so that it doesn&#039;t look any different and putting something heavy inside so the weight doesn&#039;t seem off. Only issue I could think of would be the sound from hitting the door in the hollowed area.

				Someone looking for hidden stashes will be looking for lack of dust. If your trophies are stored in basement and they are not dusty, someone have touched them recently, right?<br /><br />I will not reveal my hidden stash practices. I don&#039;t have them nowhere near my property anyway.

				How to Hide Anything is a very old book and probably every LEO know about it. Having that book at your home is dumb. Telling about it in here is not very smart.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter how ingenious your secret place is. If the cops have a warrant they&#039;ll search everywhere and will break walls if they suspect it has something inside. With dogs? Catastrophic.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a seller, NEVER keep (a lot of) money or drugs at your home. Leave the money with someone you trust (mom or granny). For the stash, keep it away from your property. It&#039;s less convenient but you&#039;ll regret not doing it when the shit hit the fan.

				In my opinion the 2 best ways to hide a serious stash are to either go find a local concrete culvert and break away a bit of the concrete, place your stash in a VERY SECURE BOX in the concrete and a small RFID chip. Then reseal the hole with some instant concrete.<br /><br />for added measures you can always use a metal drawer type system and load it with thermite, magnesium and 2 igniters (redundancy), then set it up so that if not opened in a very special way (or with another RFID chip present) it burst into flames at insane temrpatures and melts the shit out of anything inside.<br /><br /><br />However, neither of these are very economical ways to hide something and are really only suggested for long term storage of small objects.<br />e.g: an unregistered post 1986 full-auto sear

				If someone knows you have drugs in the house, it doesn&#039;t really matter if they find them or not. The trick is to hide your stuff so well that nobody will even suspect you have it, and this involves a lot more acting and social engineering than it does sneakiness and craftsmanship.<br /><br />But you can&#039;t just leave your drugs laying around (unless you&#039;re wowzers 8)) so clever stash camouflage is always a good idea. I&#039;ve always liked old books, ever since I was a kid. My grandparents had an amazing library where I read my first volumes of Conan Doyle and Verne as a child. The smell and texture of old books attracts me, sometimes more than the book itself. As a result, I have accumulated a library of over two thousand and five hundred volumes, most of which are older than myself. Two of them are hollowed out. None of them are dusty, since I clean my shelves and air out the books every four months. But that won&#039;t cover up the smell of old leather, wood and paper... though these smells, in turn, cover up anything else.<br /><br />I could walk you into my house, even after telling you this, and bet you that you&#039;ll give up before finding my stash. I&#039;d probably win the bet. And this is assuming you know that it&#039;s there. The police can bring in dogs to individually hump all my books and they still won&#039;t get a whiff of anything. Add to that all the wooden furniture and other nooks and crannies where my stuff might be hidden, and unless I&quot;m suspected of some very hideous crimes, nobody will have the patience to go through it.<br /><br />Hollow books are like hiding under the bed in a game of hide-and-seek. It&#039;s such a cliché that it&#039;s the last place anyone will look, and most people won&#039;t even seriously consider the possibility. They think it&#039;s something out of a silly old movie, like the secret doorway behind the bookshelf that swings open when you pull out a specific volume.

				If you are smart about it, with the commercial stash cans you can make a very convincing stash: shaving cream, left on end to dry and look like use, keep it in trash can or a food can admist a stash of stored canned foods.
