				Hello everyone at SR; new user here. I&#039;ll get right into what I want to say: basically what happened is I had a double transfer of bitcoins from MtGox. What I mean by this is that I withdrew bitcoins from MtGox to my SR wallet and that a few hours later a duplicate transaction happened so now I have double the amount of bitcoins I wanted. I originally paid money to MtGox thru bank transfer and did a trial run last week with only a few Â£s. I deposited more yesterday and bought bitcoins this morning and did the transfer this afternoon. After noticing I had a double transfer I emptied my bank account in case they try and charge me (I don&#039;t think they can as I did a bank transfer).<br /><br />So what could have happened here? I have to admit I am not terribly well versed in the workings of bitcoins and all of this is a bit new to me; to have such an anomaly on my second transfer is slightly disconcerting. What should I do? Just be happy that I now have double my money&nbsp; to spend on goodies?

				well something similar happened to me. i bought BTC off of get-bitcoin.com and they gave about double the amount i payed for. i just transfered it to another wallet to be safe. so yeah idk if they gave me extra or if someone accidentally put money in there or what? im still like wtf happened? but it doesnt even bother me that i dont know cause its more money lol. get-bitcoin.com is good atm. oh an mine was a cash deposit aswell.

				What goes around comes around, you might want to consider contacting Gox and letting them know, and making it right. They are not the best when they are in the wrong and the decision could go wither way, but if you got up side on an error....well, you might need them someday. My 2 cents.
