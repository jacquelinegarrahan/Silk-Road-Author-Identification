				I have been using bitinstant for almost a year now, I think, with no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; Recently, though, they&#039;ve been a major pain in my ass and today I stupidly made a cash deposit and then saw on their facebook wall a plethora of posts from angry customers not getting their money.<br /><br />anyone know what the deal is?&nbsp; should I just assume I got robbed today?

				I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d go as far as to say you got robbed. Their service has definitely gown downhill lately, though. I quit using them a few months ago and it was getting worse at that time. Apparently it has continued that trend. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get your BTC eventually, although it&#039;s hard to say when.

				This is troubling news indeed. Haven&#039;t purchased any coin for a couple months now but I had always wondered why Bitinstant wouldn&#039;t take advantage of their customers. But hopefully they resolve the issue and gain back some credibility.

				I&#039;ve had success with bitfloor, just be careful, it seems I get back less coin when I go through them. I chose a market order though, so you may do better if you name your price and wait for a seller.

				My take is that they are incompetent and are currently operating in Ponze mode. IE, you try to buy bitcoins but they can&#039;t deliver at that time because they use your money to pay their backlog of orders. They wait until the next guy tries to buy bitcoins and then they deliver your bitcoins using the new guy&#039;s money. Wash, rinse, repeat. They will of course ultimately fail.

				I brought this up on the technical support page and I got around the same feedback. I&#039;m worried about this, waited this weekend for my BTC to deposit after I got an email from ZipZap and I watched the price rise &gt; $55 before they deposited. Did a lot of reading on their support and Facebook pages, and their support agents were using smileys on like every message sent by a dissatisfied customer. Are they really taking this seriously? <br /><br />I&#039;m going to have to check out Bitfloor. I know the market is expanding and all, but so is their revenue as a paid service. They should compensate for it.

				they are responding emoticons to people on facebook but not via email?????&nbsp; wtf is going on over there?&nbsp; Is bitinstant being run by a group of 14 year old girls????&nbsp; i can&#039;t believe i&#039;m saying this but &quot;i wish i had facebook&quot; so i could spam the fuck out of their wall until they finally pay attention to me.<br /><br />i&#039;m starting to email them every morning and night hoping for a response, but still nothing.&nbsp; i just want this transaction to be over so i can never use their service ever again.

				I feel you man. That is the last time I&#039;m using them! I would make a Facebook account just to get through to them, even if it&#039;s a fake one. Most responses I saw took under 6 hours, although whoever is running the page is most likely a middle school 4H group considering how they are treating their customers.&nbsp; :P

				If all these problems with bitinstant started around the time of the market fluctuations, then that likely explains it. Did the other reasonably quick btc exchanges (bitfloor, blue sky) start delaying orders too? If not, then bitnstant deserves to lose business for holding onto their coins instead of taking care of customers. I doubt anyone will ever use them again in times of uncertainty, especially if there are alternatives.

				JUST DONT USE THEM! TIRED OF THIS DISCUSSION/DEBATE.<br /><br />There are enough topics and reports of them completely screwing people out of there cash and then giving them the run around. A lot of accounts are being shut down left and right now and I&#039;m sure BitInstant is going to be going down soon.<br /><br />STOP FUELING THE FIRE! DONT RISK YOUR CASH FOR THERE SERVICE!

One shady thing that BitInstant does when the value of BTC is rising is to somehow &quot;lose&quot; your transfer until you contact them about it. They then claim that the transfer had an error and &quot;must be put through manually&quot;.<br /><br />The problem with that, is that after you get your BTC a day or two later, they will give you the BTC at the going market rate on the day that they finally pay you. BitInstant then pockets the money that was created by the rise in value of BTC in between the time of your purchase and the time of their delivery.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />You pay BitInstant for 1 BTC valued at $10.<br /><br />BitInstant &quot;loses&quot; your transaction and it must be &quot;put through manually&quot;. The price of BTC increases over this time frame.<br /><br />BitInstant finally pays you, but instead of giving you that 1 BTC for the $10 that you paid, they instead give you 0.5 BTC because BTC jumped in value from $10 to $20 over the course of this deal.<br /><br />BitInstant bought that 1 BTC with your money, held it for a couple of days, shaved off the interest and then gave you BTC at the current market rate.<br /><br />Fuck you, BitInstant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They&#039;re supposed to honor the rate at the time of the deposit. But they only do that IF you complain about it. They treat that as a separate issue from not having received your coins. So basically, its send money, coins don&#039;t come, go complain, get assigned a support ticket, wait till they get to you, get less coins than you should have, and the problem is listed as solved according to them because you got SOME coins. Go home with your less coins. <br /><br />If you have a problem with the rate they used to give you less coins, you&#039;d have to go and complain again and they&#039;ll make a new support ticket and you&#039;ll have to wait for them to fix it, while they&#039;re fixing the initial problems of other people. All in all, it took me a week and a half to get this done after I ended up emailing the CEO a bunch of times

				Same as always I say screw BitlyUninstant.&nbsp; They slide you in with ease at first cause no one Ive heard of had problems.&nbsp; Start making larger deposits then u get that random error a friend got and lost in translation with bs emails half answered, and then it was resolved.... just three weeks later ... ?&nbsp; See other thread about bitcoin purchasing it higlight options I know of by Vegeta.. MP will always be a risk if you think someone will let 1000 bucks at 100 ramp to 290 or something and wont pocket it.... <br /><br />Bitinstant will be ur route though bc they can control that supply and demand.&nbsp;
