				Well, i&#039;ve made it this far but feel I am only at the start of a very steep learning curve !<br />I am very keen to start making the most of the site as you can imagine but i&#039;m not ready to consider making any purchases as there is so much that is completely and utterly alien to me !&nbsp; (I am definatley not what you would call PC literate)<br /><br />Bitcoin is still a bit of a mystery to me but im sure with some research I can suss it out with a bit of time.&nbsp; My primary concern is with security. Encrypted messages/PGP is way over my head at this moment unfortunately.(ie I dont understand it whatsoever)&nbsp; Can anyone point me in the right direction with some links to help in this regard ? Even just some real basic advice on things i must be aware/implement would be a great starting point and much appreciated !<br /><br />I am going to spend some time on the forums and do plenty of research but my brain is hurting already honestly !<br /><br />Thanks in advance ... :) <br /><br />

				&nbsp;Beardedwonder i&#039;m kinda in the sames spot as you in the sense that my primary concern is with security. i have the encryption figured out thanks to a nice guide. What i want need to know is if it&#039;s cool to sign up with a Bitcoin Exchange site using my real name and email.

				Welcome to the deep web.<br /><br />The amount of new information and new concepts are a little overwhelming at first, but don&#039;t be scared. Sit down, have a nice cup of tea and research these things a little bit. It&#039;s not all that difficult.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of useful material on this forum, this security section is a good place to start.

				PGP Club! <br /><br />Although I must warn you I&#039;m a bit swamped with message at the moment. But if you send me a PM I&#039;ll reply when I get a chance. Download GPG4USB, make a PGP key and then give me the public key.
