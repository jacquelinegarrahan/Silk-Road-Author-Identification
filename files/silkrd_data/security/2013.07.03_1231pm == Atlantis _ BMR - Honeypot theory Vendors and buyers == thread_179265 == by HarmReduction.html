				A few people have emailed me re Atlantis &amp; BMR are entrapment sites. <br />What makes this site a safer option as compared to&nbsp; Atlantis ?&nbsp; <br />According to an article (clear web) http://allthingsvice.com/2013/07/03/silk-road-responds-to-competition-with-improvements-of-its-own/<br /><br />&#039; Atlantis Marketplace has undertaken aggressive marketing of its site over the past few months, touting superior features to those offered by Silk Road.&nbsp; Its aim has been to both attract new customers and lure clients away from the incumbent giant, but so far they must be underwhelmed by the response ...... .Attracting sellers has not been an issue. But still the customers stayed away.&nbsp; One of the highest-ranked sellers on the Road, with thousands of completed orders and hundreds of satisfied customers, opened an account on Atlantis four months ago and as of today had made a mere six sales.&nbsp; Other vendors also decided lack of customers made it not worth their while to maintain a presence and closed up shop.&#039; <br /><br />Any thoughts ?<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t quite get it. If it is a honeypot, how are they going to identify buyers and sellers? They certainly won&#039;t know any details about the sellers. The details about the buyers they will know only if the buyer fails to use PGP with a strong key when sending the address/details to the seller. Granted they might catch some by people relying on the &#039;auto encryption&#039;.<br /><br />Atlantis attracted vendors by offering them steep discounts or I think maybe even free setup if they were already an established vendor on SR. But right I don&#039;t think at the time they had the customer base (and probably still don&#039;t). But they probably wanted to get vendors lined up first. No sense putting out your Youtube videos and stuff only to have people come and find like 3 things for sale.

				I think it is not even legally possible to host something like that for the gov. It is basically providing a platform for illegal things without them are able to catch most of the guys. Specially that most of the times possible vendors or customers dont even come from their country..... That would give them an awful lot of work for close to none profit. Not worth at all. Not practicable at all.<br /><br />So in my book the chances that the gov or any other LE setting up such a thing are close to none.

				Ok so why is Atlantis not attracting buyers why are buyer&#039;s reluctant to buy from the site as opposed to SR

				Secret Service has run at least 4 blackmarket clearnet forums that I know of to arrest carders/fraudsters, and even set up a completely phony forum about 3yrs ago for the sole purpose of entrapment. I don&#039;t think cops are allowed to handle escrow though, but who knows as everything has been turned on it&#039;s head and court cases are just plea bargaining show trials now. <br /><br />There&#039;s probably more undercover feds and confidential informants here either as database admins (remember when SR was hiring?) or watching the private vendor and public forums than there are over at Atlantis simply because this place is older and get&#039;s more press. This site also generates a lot more Tor traffic that needs hiding. <br /><br />BMR is definitely not a honeypot, if you were on 4chan circa 2008 you know exactly who the admin is. Atlantis who knows. If I was a cop and tasked with bringing down Tor forums I&#039;d be cashing out people&#039;s bitcoins so there would be a money trail. I&#039;d also be social engineering them to accept cash by mail or trades, or I would worm my way into the private areas as a fully vouched member and glean intel, trying to work my way up the ladder into co-admin so I can get access to the code/server<br />

				SR is easier for me. SR is competent. SR is free for vendors. <br /><br />Why choose a suspect site with questionable advertisements, trying to steal customers/vendors. For vendors its not attractive because there is no customer base. Here on sr u have what? 100.000 possible customers? There is just no reason to go elsewhere than sr. All ur wishes come true here :)<br /><br />Way more features. Such as hedging the order. Is that an option on Atlantis? This is ultimately needed in the times of volatile bitcoins. Cant believe the admins earn enough to offer such a service. One little crash and they would be out of business.<br /><br />BMR the admin is ignorant. Doesnt hear what vendors or customers say. I didnt look into it for quite some time now but the last time i looked the Menu was horribly sorted... absolutely not enjoyable to browse there. Find something back u have seen 10 minutes ago was close to impossible.... Any tries of the community helping sorting this mess failed. <br />I dont want a lazy incompetent admin take care for my security. The whole sr packet is just absolutely outstanding. Anybody want to go head to head with sr will have a hard time.

Some of us work with/for SR. Some of us just respect and fight for what provides us with a better life. Having people coming over from&nbsp; Atlantis saying &#039;hey can u make a vendor account on atlantis so i can buy from u with my coupon code&#039; and try to steal vendors is very annoying. Having their admins ddosing (even if not proven, everyone knows where it came from) SR to make their customers go and look over to atlantis is what reflects the Operators character AND is very annoying. Making public advertisement on youtube.... u want me to go on? i can do this all day long if u want...<br /><br />Behavior like this should be punished with total ignorance (at least in my opinion). They deserve their bad reputation u can believe that.<br /><br />

				Even if LE wanted to run a honeypot and catch buyers, what could they possible charge you with for sending someone some BTC and typing your address in a box (encrypted or not)? Wanting to get high? In what countries is that crime?<br /><br />As an example, even in jurisdictions where homosexuality was or is illegal, the crime is not &quot;being a homosexual&quot; or &quot;thinking homosexual thoughts&quot;, it&#039;s committing homosexual acts. Wanting drugs is not a crime anywhere that I know of, and LE&#039;s budget is stretched tight in every place I&#039;ve ever heard of, so a honeypot to nail people who&#039;d like to use but don&#039;t possess anything is beyond unrealistic in my opinion.

Why wouldn&#039;t you just encrypt you do here &amp; avoid the issue entirely. An unfortunate number of people on SR don&#039;t use encryption anyway &amp; I&#039;m sure the same is true of Atlantis. The biggest reason I think the built-in encryption is a bad idea is that it encourages laziness &amp; poor security practices. A false sense of security is often worse than no security at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />And to the OP:<br /><br />I don&#039;t think an SR-like honeypot is likely for a few reasons. It would take a great deal of time and effort to maintain but the value to LE would be negligible. Vendors don&#039;t give out their addresses &amp; the DEA would look ridiculous if they focused on chasing down whatever personal use buyers failed to use encryption. It would require a long time investment with no guarantee of success, esp given that people come and go from such sites &amp; often move over the course of a year or two, so in addition to just gathering the information they&#039;d have to go to even more effort to track down users who might no longer even be involved w drugs.&nbsp; Basically all it would get them would be a huge mess of bad leads &amp; difficult to piece together evidence in the form of Bitcoin addresses &amp; user names. It just wouldn&#039;t be worth it. Keep in mind too that the carding example involved agencies &amp; agents that specialized in computer crimes. The DEA def has analysts &amp; experts in computer forensics etc, but they&#039;re not the Secret Service.<br /><br />Focusing on the weaknesses of SR / BMR / Atlantis-style markets - like the points at which users need to convert cash to Bitcoin and vice versa &amp; the mail system - is easier &amp; more efficient, as it addresses the system being used rather than individual sites &amp; basically just follows the usual routes of money laundering/smuggling, both of which the DEA are kinda expert in. I would expect they&#039;d spend their efforts there, where they are guaranteed some amount of success, rather than by gambling on a honeypot. <br /><br />Still best to be cautious, tho. <br />

				I was one of the first to be suspicious of Atlantis and voicing the same concerns of honeypot situations.<br />But this was merely due to the buzz they were creating and it coinciding with the attacks on SR.<br />I was not a happy trooper+an invisible SR enemy made it easy to lash out against ATL.<br /><br />But that&#039;s in the past.<br /><br />Fanboy attitude does not help positive evolution.Company loyalty should ALWAYS be to reward good work done.<br />As long as SR keeps up the good work AS ALWAYS the happy customers here will stay here.<br />Just like me.<br /><br />Things boil down to having options..and options are always good.<br />I don&#039;t want there to be only ONE option like SR.<br />So i welcome ATL and have used them succesfully when SR went down and afterwards too but simply because i had some coins stored on that account and i thought it might help out my vendor if they had regular customers over there.That didn&#039;t seem to be the case so meh ATL has no more business from me:).<br /><br />As this particular niche market attracts even more scammers then a regular market like ebay f.e. it is normal that ATL is not picking up as fast.<br />SR has a strong reputation coupled to a forum that is very well visited.(never enough visited by everyone when you read certain scam stories:)).<br />So the only vendor on their i trust is the one i&#039;ve come to know HERE on SR and through the reviews HERE on this forum.<br /><br />So any strength ATL-vendors have reputation-wise only come from this SR and this forum.Hence the strength from ATL is not from their own merit yet. Which also will put off customers.<br /><br />Their own forums are basicly empty and when i posted in a topic that dealt with someone having a bad experience with a vendor i deal with on a regular basis (i see my self as a regular:)) they completely whiped it.<br />Bad move in my opinion.<br />The poster was not&nbsp; making wild claims and even informed that with help of atlantis support he got refunded.He just expressed certain doubts.<br />I asked for this poster to elaborate and I informed him of my excellent dealings with this vendor and that i would let him know if my next order was going to happen as always so he(and others reading it) could be reassured the vendor did not turn rogue or anything.<br /><br />If they keep deleting such threads they NEVER will built up any credit regarding honesty.It comes across as silencing critical voices.<br /><br />Here it would never happen.You often know how to differentiate between false reviews or reviewers hired by scam vendors or not if you are on the forum long enough(and have some common sense of course:)).The behaviour of a vendor when responding to certain allegations also helps you decide if this is the sort of vendor you want to do business with.<br /><br />So basicly they(ATL) are at fault themselves for not generating more business and having people hesitating to do business with them or to shy away from them due to suspicions like honeypot operations and what not.<br />And vendors will of course favour the market that gives them more customers.<br /><br />Meaning ATL has a long road ahead of them establishing themselves ASIDE from SR.<br />And market themselves next to a giant like SR.Just like all the other internetshops on the clearnet have done in the past.<br /><br />If their intentions are good they will have the patience to work at growing.And find their own place in the market.<br />Like i already said,if they are totally legit i welcome them to market and hope they will follow in SR&#039;s footsteps when it comes to the ideals they have and respect the one that came before them.<br />They will need to find a balance between customer and vendor satisfaction.<br /><br />SR will remain&nbsp; nr.1 because they have done ALOT ALOT if not all of the heavy lifting.Also they survived the buzz created on the clearnet.<br />They stayed on track with their ideals and kept their standards high.<br />This is something i do not think will change anytime soon so they will probably always have such a strong position.<br />THAT&#039;S why i am here.<br /><br />Simple as that.

A little competition between businesses and platforms is good for those who use them &amp; good for the businesses themselves. I highly doubt Atlantis will ever really challenge SR (platform aside, the SR team seems much more professional &amp; serious about running a good business &amp; as you said did most of the initial work in creating the model to start) but there&#039;s no reason why they can&#039;t exist alongside each other.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus having more small marketplaces would make it safer &amp; easier for all involved. The bigger SR gets, the bigger a target it becomes and the harder it is/will be for it to stay hidden. Other marketplaces would do more to help SR survive over the long run than hurt it. <br /><br />I think one thing SR did right in the beginning was the forums and the tone they set. (Is the reading group still around?) DPRs early posts were so v idealistic &amp; passionate &amp; so unusual in their politics that they felt genuine, and regardless of your beliefs about agorism &amp; counter economics &amp; the rest, the quality of the discussion was higher what you often find on the deepweb. imo this made the early site much more appealing to professional/intelligent/discreet users (esp those who found it from early media stories), less interesting to scammers &amp; in general made the place feel more inspiring than shady. If the forum topics had been &quot;Blackhat Hangout&quot; &quot;Snitch List (for doxing)&quot; &quot;Trip Reportz&quot;&nbsp; etc I&#039;m sure the site would look v different today. <br /><br />But now I&#039;m trying to write Oz&#039;s book for her... ;)

				One thing I find particularly odd about BMR and Atlantis is the automated PGP. <br /><br />Excuse me if I&#039;m wrong, but isn&#039;t PGP supposed to be a safeguard against the possibility that the main server is somehow compromised? It seems that letting anything leave in plaintext sort of defeats the purpose.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Other than that, I don&#039;t understand why people have to stick only to SR. As having multiple vendors compete improves product, having multiple instances of online markets improves service overall.&nbsp; Also, certain things cannot be bought on SR that can on BMR, especially.<br />

				Will have to check it out myself then I guess. I suppose the truth about BMR/Atlantis will be known in the long term. In the meantime, i&#039;m willing to give both the benefit of the doubt. The Atlantis stunt seems to me a case of aggressive (if misguided) marketing, because they have such a large and successful rival to compete with, and as people have pointed out, they desperately need buyers to make use of the many vendors they already have. I see it as good competition really, a reason for SR to maintain its own, well deserved, reputation.&nbsp; 8)

It is basically providing a platform for illegal things without them are able to catch most of the guys. Specially that most of the times possible vendors or customers dont even come from their country..... That would give them an awful lot of work for close to none profit. Not worth at all. Not practicable at all.<br /><br />So in my book the chances that the gov or any other LE setting up such a thing are close to none.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />sorry to bust your bubble, but the US gov&#039;t breaks it&#039;s own rules all the time - look at what they&#039;ve done in congress, committed perjury (in the IRS scandal &amp; the Benghazi scandal as well) - then go look at Fast &amp; Furious - forget they were breaking State Dept export regs, they WERE SENDING GUNS TO THE CARTELS - over 2,000 rifles. Do a little research on it, and look at how they conducted themselves during that &quot;operation&quot;. There was one shop in Texas (either dallas or houston) that had called ATF local office that they had a kid in the shop, who couldn&#039;t speak english, with a grocery bag of cash who wanted to buy 5 AK-47s, and they asked atf did they want to come down and &quot;interview&quot; this guy? ATF&#039;s response, nope- we&#039;ve got him under surveillance, it&#039;s under control, go ahead and make the sale - uh, but btw, do you mind sending one of your employees out into the parking lot and writing down their license plate?&quot;&nbsp; This went on for 1 &amp; 1/2 years,. with letters and emails from the shop owner to local atf supervisor, indicating they weren&#039;t comfortable making these sales, as they had a number of border patrol agents as customers and friends, and didn&#039;t want to learn on of the guns they&#039;d sold had been used to shoot a BP agent. ATF response again was, we&#039;ve got it under control, nothing to worry about. <br /><br />Well, after having spent the $60 million appropriation congress had granted ATF for &quot;operation gunrunner&quot;, the GAO did an audit (there were tons of complaints from ATF agents on CleanUpATF.org complaining how they&#039;d been rotated to phoenix and dallas only to be lent out to DEA to help in stake outs). Anyway, GAO report was condemning of ATF, citing few results, poor management etc. Before GAO releases a report publicly, they always give a copy to the subject agency (ATF) to review so they can prepare their response.<br /><br />ATF used the opportunity or time window before GAO released the report to try to get some positive publicity, so they charged Carter Country, the very store (has four branches) with making illegal sales to suspicious buyers and making straw sales. (do a google for Dick Deguiren - ATF - Carter Country). It took him 3 conferences with the local US Attorney to convince him ATF was simply looking for publicity, that the charges were bogus. The US Atty dropped the charges and sent out a memo to all the local LE agencies (both police and sheriff&#039;s depts) telling them to NOT bring his office any cases involving ATF in the future (ie, they couldn&#039;t be trusted, not even by the US Atty&#039;s office).<br /><br />that isn&#039;t the first time a US Prosecutor has taken that step - Reno, Nevada and somewhere in Utah<br /><br />wrap your brain around allowing 2,000+ guns go to mexican cartels, resulting in (current count) 700+ fatalities including 2 US federal agents, all for the purpose of establishing a platform for calling for more gun control legislation. Then the stupidity / hypocrocisy and total lack of any integrity in charging the very shop that was assisting ATF.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got about 25 stories, documented with the court docket numbers in most cases, where ATF committed complete perjury to convict an innocent firearms dealer. In the most egregious, the assistant chief of the ATF&#039;s NFA (branch responsible for machinegun, silencers etc ) was caught in the appeals trials, his perjury completely outed, no question, no plausible denialbility - the result - the judge got so outraged he wrote a letter to GAO&#039;s Office of Professional Mis-conduct on that assistant branch chief&#039;s perjury. Two weeks later, that assistant chief was made the Acting Chief of that branch and remained so until he retired 8 years later.<br /><br />Amongst law enforcement, ATF has the most vile reputation (stmt to me by a retired DOJ prosecutor - it&#039;s the most vile law enfocement agency on the planet) - good / honest agents don&#039;t stay long when they realize how bad it is and transfer to any other agency.<br /><br />DEA is no better - every year DEA and ATF seem to swap the crown for the worst .<br /><br />then think about the politics of drugs - drugs are bad, we break this darknet thing and the public will not care about a little &quot;rule bending&quot;, then add to that most LE brains are burnt from too many steriods muscling up and the rambo wannabe personality too many exhibit.<br /><br />here&#039;s what the popo have become&nbsp; http://www.infowars.com/florida-nurse-terrorized-by-us-marshals/<br />and http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323848804578608040780519904.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories<br /><br />as far as gov&#039;t doing anything illegal - go back and study the IRS scandal - not only targeting conservative 501c3 group tax exempt applications, but it has come out they revealed info from those applications to those groups liberal opposition groups (donor name lists) - this comes out in congress, and those people still have their jobs......<br /><br />yeah, i&#039;m convinced, Atlantis and BMR can&#039;t be LE stings, no way</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Competition is necessary to maintain a healthy, progressive marketplace.<br /><br />On a side note: I liked the &quot;old&quot; DPR better.

The unions that supported obama have already started screaming this is going to destroy the healthcare they had under their contracts. The IRS that is going to administer it has said it doesn&#039;t want to, the Head of the IRS has said he wants his own healthcare over obamacare, and congress critters (staffers etc) complained,, so just today obama announced their healthcare would be re-imbursed 75% by the Office of Public Management.

				Yeah, frank-butcher is right about the Mail. It&#039;s probably the most hysterical, right-wing paper in the UK. For all the many faults of the NHS, at least EVERYONE has a right to medical care, and if the rich don&#039;t like it, they can always go private. The situation in the US just seems very unfair for those who can&#039;t afford insurance.

				to be really really honest about it, i really don&#039;t care to argue politics in any forum<br /><br />to continue on my strain of honesty, i like the mailonline for all the fucking shots of bikini clad dollbabies in every day&#039;s edition, plus there&#039;s always some interesting animal stories - ie, a fucking skiing squirrel or what have you - quirky but entertaining<br /><br />as far as taxes collected at gunpoint - tell that to the guy that opened a deli, fired his accountant when he found she was embezzling him and had her charged. She went to the IRS and bargained that if they&#039;d get her charges dropped she&#039;d give them the &quot;evidence&quot; he was hiding income (turns out she&#039;d just come out of prison (when he first hired her) for embezzling from her previous employer, a bank) - no matter that she was a doubtful source. the IRS did a swat team raid on the deli (found no &quot;boxes with $20,000 in bills) as she&#039;dd described, so they raided his house while he was in the shower, forcing him out of the shower at gunpoint (swat officer clad invest, helmet and carrying a subgun) with suds still on his head from shampooing, and his teenage daughters sleepover, all her friends were held at gunpoint and herded into the living room while they searched the house - this was all over thinking a deli, with maybe a $1500-2000 a day intake, could squirrel away $20K a week, per their &quot;snitch&quot;.<br /><br />that guy ended up testifying at congressional hearing, back around 2000-2001 iirc<br /><br />I could tell you more about the IRS, how they went and visited my friend&#039;s dying mother in the hospital, she was 86 yrs old, wanting her to give them the money they claimed he owed. They&#039;d already seized his resturant (preventing him from earning the money they felt he owed) and seized one rental property that i was trying to sell for him so he could, again, generate the money he needed to pay them - it&#039;s absolutely lovely when you meet a client at a property to show them, and on the front door is an IRS notice, instructing the tenants to pay their rent to the IRS, that the property has been &quot;seized&quot;. They did one week&nbsp; after agreeing to give him 90 days to raise the money and agreeing to not seizing anything during that 90 days.<br /><br />

I got audited four years in a row. 2nd year, i got a &quot;request for interview appointment&quot; signed by a &quot;Christine xxx&quot;, received it in the mailbox on a Tuesday. I contacted my accountant to have him respond. On Thursday, (that&#039;s two whole days later) i received a 2nd request, this one &quot;DEMANDING I RESPOND TO HER PREVIOUS REQUEST IMMEDIATELY&quot; like i was some errant child mis-behaving in school. <br /><br />I responded by telephone, indicating that i had given her info to my acct, and he said he&#039;s left two msgs, so it would be a good idea if she returned his call. She tried to give me some arrogance but i cut her off with the phrase &quot;excuse me for talking while you&#039;re interrupting, i realize how rude that must be&quot; - that knocked her off balance for a second. I then informed her my phone lines are recorded, so be mindful to offer me the courtesy she expected of me, or this would be on the news tomorrow night (my brother-in-law is a news producer for one of the local TV channels). <br /><br />She then instructed me to be at her office at 9:00AM the next morning with all my returns and receipts. I reminded her, when i have an IRS enrolled agent representing me, i do not have any obligation to respond to her directly. 2nd, if she wanted to see any rcpts, to feel free to come to my office and i wouldd make them available, but if she wanted any copies, to bring her own copier and her own generator, as i was under no obligation to provide those.<br /><br />The trick with them asking you any question is, they can mis-characterize your answer - i&#039;d already learned that in the previous audit. Example : Mr XXX, your return shows a 90 day loan taken out 3 years ago - for what purpose were those funds used?. (i was in a business developing properties, and we probably took out thirty 90 day notes in three years, so remembering one, without the file in my hand is impossible. So i had indicated i&#039;d have to get back to her.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t matter, she took the answer i gave in saying &quot;i&#039;d have to pull that file and get back to her&quot; as &quot;unsatisfactory, and changed how that loan was treated so that my tax exposure was increased for that year, AND because i had therefore underpaid, there was a 20% penalty + interest on the amount underpaid.&nbsp; <br /><br />We had about 80 apartments - on some we pay the utilities (elec + water/sewer etc). Every monthly bill is a receipt for last month&#039;s pmt as well as a bill for this month&#039;s amount due. She wanted EVERY CANCELED CHECK for every pmt for every utility bill for the previous three years - about 4-6 hours work pulling the checking stmts, pulling the individual checks, zeroxing and sending to the accountant to give her, EVEN THOUGH EACH BILL SHOWED RECEIPT FOR THE PREVIOUS MONTHS&#039; PMT. This went on for about 6 months, every week or two a new mindless request like that, to basically wear you down, so when they say <br />&quot;we find you owe $12,468.01&quot;, they&#039;re thinking you&#039;ll take that and pay it just to end the fucking nightmare.<br /><br />It was in the Kippinger Letter that that had become the new MO (method of operation) at the IRS, to bleed business owners of any money they could.<br /><br />now, a lot of them are bored, and some of those would like to get over to the law enfocement side and be Eliot Ness or G-men, get to wear vests, carry subguns and kick in doors. <br /><br />There is a mentality at the IRS to instill fear into the population so everyone is too scared to underpay their taxes. That was one reason they&nbsp; seized the resturant - an idiot knew that client couldn&#039;t pay without his place of business open. They didn&#039;t want the money, they wanted the publicity - that was more important to them. BTW, that resturant seizure made it into the local newspaper, sunday edition, basically reciting what i&#039;ve said about they&#039;re not wanting the money, the fear that the publicity would generate was more important to them. A guy&#039;s life was dealt a major interruption over an $11,000 appox bill - and that bill includes their outrageous penalties and interest.<br /><br />America, the home of the free and the sheeple

They are different concepts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />in reverse order, think you&#039;re confusing my posts with someone else - don&#039;t recall calling socialists mass-murders but that assessment isn&#039;t too far from being accurate. But if you want this conversation to continue, please refrain from putting words in my mouth or mis-characterizing what i&#039;ve said.<br /><br />IRS = Internal Revenue Service, and no, those are not isolated incidents. Even in every day normal audits, they&#039;re brutally ugly, rude &amp; arrogant. I got audited four years in a row. 2nd year, i got a &quot;request for interview appointment&quot; signed by a &quot;Christine xxx&quot;, received it in the mailbox on a Tuesday. I contacted my accountant to have him respond. On Thursday, (that&#039;s two whole days later) i received a 2nd request, this one &quot;DEMANDING I RESPOND TO HER PREVIOUS REQUEST IMMEDIATELY&quot; like i was some errant child mis-behaving in school. And remember, i&#039;d only gotten her first notice 48 hours earlier.<br /><br />I responded by telephone, indicating that i had given her info to my accountant, and he said he&#039;d left two msgs, so it would be a good idea if she returned his call. She tried to give me some arrogance but i cut her off with the phrase &quot;excuse me for talking while you&#039;re interrupting, i realize how rude that must be&quot; - that knocked her off balance for a second. I then informed her my phone lines are recorded, so be mindful to offer me the courtesy she expected of me, or this would be on the news tomorrow night (my brother-in-law is a news producer for one of the local TV channels). <br /><br />She then instructed me to be at her office at 9:00AM the next morning with all my returns and receipts. I reminded her, when i have an IRS enrolled agent representing me, i do not have any obligation to respond to her directly. 2nd, if she wanted to see any rcpts, to feel free to come to my office and i wouldd make them available, but if she wanted any copies, to bring her own copier and her own generator, as i was under no obligation to provide those. A) there&#039;s no obligation for me to appear at her office - if she wanted to see my receipts, come to the office. The only obligation a citizen has is to make them available. The previous year when i had sent them in (about 2 boxes, all filed neatly) they came back looking like they&#039;d been thru a bingo mixer, and god&#039;s knows if it was all there or if anything was missing, that i&#039;d need at a future audit.<br /><br />The trick with them asking you any question and wanting a response from the citizen is, they can mis-characterize your answer, or if you don&#039;t use the proper phrase, they can decide to retreat that expense as you&#039;d said &quot;xxx&quot; instead of &quot;yyy&quot; - i&#039;d already learned that in the previous audit. Example : Mr XXX, your return shows a 90 day loan taken out 3 years ago - for what purpose were those funds used?. (i was in a business developing properties, and we probably took out thirty 90 day notes in three years, so remembering one, without the file in my hand is impossible.

Turned out that loan was for a $12,000 boiler for a six unit apartment building, and was properly treated as the old boiler had exploded, doing a lot of damage to the ceiling or floor of the apartment directly above, as well as other equipment in the furnace room.<br /><br />We had about 80 apartments - on some we pay the utilities (elec + water/sewer etc). Every monthly bill is a receipt for last month&#039;s pmt as well as a bill for this month&#039;s amount due.

The actual amount underpaid before the penalty &amp; interest was probably in the neighborhood of $6,000-$6,500.<br /><br />I assume you&#039;re british - i have no experience with your system, but do have some with the canadian IRS. They seem more professional and mindful of the citizens&#039; rights and more courtious. But from recent reports i&#039;ve read (and heard from friends in canada) they&#039;re learning to adopt the &quot;american way&quot;. <br /><br />America, the home of the free and the sheeple<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
