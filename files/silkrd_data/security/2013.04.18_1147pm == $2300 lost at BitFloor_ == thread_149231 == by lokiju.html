				I didn&#039;t hear about the message that Roman sent to some of his customers yesterday saying he was closing down at 6:00 pm. I went to BitFloor today, I had sold my BTC when they went down to $75, it was around $2000 in account. Now they let me put in a withdraw (funny most of my money was in BTC after I sold it, but it showed up in USD) and nothing has happened. <br />I did a search in BlockChain.info, and all it shows are my deposits into BitFloor. <br />It&#039;s not illegal to buy BTC, and I did it because it was going up so fast. Then it dropped overnight, my computer was fucked the next day and I sold at $75. <br />Now BitFloor is down. <br />Am I just out of the money? <br />Can I go to Bank of America and put a claim in or something?<br />I did great for about 7 days, had over $8000 in paper while only putting in $3000. <br />Than I was bummed because I took a &#039;haircut&#039; and sold. <br />Now it appears that it is probably all gone. <br />Does anybody have some general advice? TIA.

				I deliberately made up all fake names, is it illegal to do this? They didn&#039;t even ask me at BOA, but my email addresses, etc. are assumed and have no connection to me in any way?<br />Shit there&#039;s probably a law against buying BTC when you don&#039;t use your real name, or is there? I know the feds could give a shit unless they figure I&#039;m some vendor, not some stupid ass who &#039;invested&#039; in BTC. <br />The money isn&#039;t going to kill me, but it&#039;s almost all I had, and I&#039;m not working etc.

				My first post is confusing even to me. What happened is&nbsp; that I sold all my BTC because it was going down so fast nearly a week ago. So I had all cash in my BitFloor account. It was like 30 BTC, and at $75 it was about $2300. Now today I go there and it&#039;s like I have 25 BTC which I thought was cool since BTC had gone up since I sold a couple of days ago. So I decide to download it into my wallet. BitFloor lets me do it, but it never shows up on Blockchain, and it&#039;s probably been 5 hours. <br />Now I&#039;m reading about BitFloor&#039;s problems, and by reading between the lines figure the feds shut him down because of BTC privacy (can&#039;t have privacy in this day and age, somebody might get hurt,&nbsp; you know)<br />There aren&#039;t any laws regarding BTC that I really know about (except the feds don&#039;t need &#039;em, &#039;badges? Badges? We don&#039;t need no stinking badges&#039;<br />Since there are no laws, I figure the feds will tell me I&#039;m lucky that they don&#039;t arrest me, I can see them doing EXACTLY that. So anybody know how many or if I broke laws to buy BTC anonymously?

Did you do a Bitcoin withdrawl?<br />No, but it&#039;s illegal to buy it anonymously with US currency. BitFloor is consider a &quot;money transmitter&quot; by FinCEN, this means they have to provide AML/KYC documentation of all purchasers or else they can get their accounts frozen under suspicion of money laundering. <br />It was in the middle of bankruptcy, now it&#039;s closed. <br />Unless you identify yourself any USD is probably gone. If you have BTC you may be able to recover it.<br />Probably, although you would have to provide ID most likely.<br />Never use US-based exchanges. I know that&#039;s not what you want to hear. But anything based out of US will require verification to not be shut down like this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149231.msg1029710#msg1029710">Quote from: lokiju on April 18, 2013, 11:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I deliberately made up all fake names, is it illegal to do this? <br />Shit there&#039;s probably a law against buying BTC when you don&#039;t use your real name, or is there?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In short, yes. As BitFloor is a &quot;money transmitter&quot; they are required to provide identification. <br />Yes there is. FinCEN made it quite clear that they want all USD-BTC transactions verified. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149231.msg1029788#msg1029788">Quote from: lokiju on April 19, 2013, 12:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I had all cash in my BitFloor account it was about $2300. <br />Now today I go there and it&#039;s like I have 25 BTC.

Bizarre, I wonder if Roman will try and repay USD balances in BTC?<br />It&#039;ll probably take some time as he is more than likely doing BTC withdraws manually.<br />Yes, that&#039;s exactly why.<br />There are laws, see my previous post. Not likely to just get your money back no-strings attached. <br />BitFloor broke FinCEN regulations. The onus was on them. You can retrieve your funds, you simply need to provide adequate AML/KYC documentation as that&#039;s what they require to use US money transmitter.

				&nbsp;It&#039;s 3:48 am pacific time, and I got my coins back!!!!<br />Thank you BitFloor, thank you Roman, thank everybody. <br />It was &#039;only&#039; $2300, but it&#039;s amazing how the &#039;thought&#039; of that much money was hurting. <br /><br />Just think if I wouldn&#039;t have touched it at all, and just gone through the fall and (now) run up again!

				it&#039;s April 20 now, around midnight, and I&#039;m as pleased now as I was a couple of days ago. I like this guy, Roman, although I bet&nbsp; he had a &#039;tough row to hoe&#039;, and I&#039;d hate to be him, mired in all the feds paperwork (for our own good, or for the &#039;children&#039;s good&#039; )don&#039;t cha know<br />I&#039;d really like to know what has happended and what PriceFloor has to do with it. <br />Your retrieval of funds come close enough to make a big difference in my life.
