				I&#039;m asking because while I&#039;ve often seen similar things pop up on the clearnet, I&#039;ve never seen it before anywhere on SR so would like to know if it is anything I need to be concerned about.<br /><br />The Box says &quot;Security Alert&quot; on top, then inside it says:<br />&quot;Revocation information for the security certificate for this site is not available.&nbsp; Do you want to proceed?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then a box for &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; and &quot;View Certificate&quot;.<br />The certificate says that it&#039;s O.K.<br /><br />I figure that this is probably no big deal, especially since afaik, we don&#039;t tend to use CA&#039;s.. and maybe it is normal to pop up once in a while and I just happen to not have run into it before now.&nbsp; I was just replying to a message when it popped up and as of now, the box is still on the page as I just opened a new tab to get to the forum.<br /><br />I feel like this is probably a stupid question, but I&#039;d rather ask a stupid question than take any chances on risking my security or the security of this site in any way.... no matter how remote.<br /><br />Thanks to anyone who can clarify

				It shouldn&#039;t check for revocations of an SSL certificate unless you are typing https at the beginning, and in that case it should fail to connect to the server (I just tried it myself).<br /><br />idk, probably some bug. Obviously there are no SSL certificates involved, so checking for revocation doesn&#039;t matter.<br />

				I&#039;d be on the cautious side and wipe your box, DBAN it.

				Just a guess: An HTTPS clearnet connection is happening somewhere, maybe a browser feature (phishing check?) or toolbar/plugin thing, the exit node selected is malicious, badly configured or otherwise screwing up the CRL lookup which causes the browser to panic.<br /><br />As others have said use a proper Tor browser rather than a socks proxy in your regular browser.

I don&#039;t think I have anything to worry about in that regard either....&nbsp; except...&nbsp; it just occurred to me as I am typing this.&nbsp; My original reason for having gotten on TOR in the first place was for the anonymous tormail, and inside of tormail (not the account I created specifically for SR use when I joined this site), but I do write inside of a different Tormail account things that could identify me - which is the reason I need(ed) an email account that is private/anonymous.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not that I&#039;m thinking that stupid box showed up because I use Tormail in a separate account for my personal email, but I just now got to wondering if my identity is not as safe as I had thought by using this computer on TOR and ONLY on TOR, if I&#039;m using a Tormail account as my personal email.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t think so though.. but..???<br /><br />Anyway, on my previous computer, I would connect to a VPN prior to connecting to TOR to keep my ISP from knowing anything, then once inside TOR, I&#039;d disconnect from that one and connect to a different VPN over TOR with which I did use a socks proxy, in order to keep my IP protected in case of a malicious exit node.&nbsp; But on this new computer, I just use the Tor Browser Bundle and make a direct connection.<br /><br />Sorry for all the boring details.&nbsp; I&#039;d all but forgotten about that Security Alert box since I&#039;ve not seen it since and have been under the impression that I&#039;m pretty safe as far as my identity not being easily revealed since I&#039;ve gotten on a computer that has never had a clearnet connection made...<br /><br />I was surprised to find these last two replies that have showed up and both of them have me thinking that maybe I was too hasty in dismissing the box as a bug.....<br /><br />With the details I just described about my current setup, circumstances regarding how this computer has and has not been used, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp;does anyone still think that I need to worry anymore about that one time appearance of the security box?&nbsp; Or have any suggestions of what I may be unintentionally doing wrong?&nbsp; I would welcome any constructive criticism and/or advice regarding security...&nbsp; (or anything else)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thanks......
