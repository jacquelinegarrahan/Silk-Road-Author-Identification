				I&#039;ve got a few questions. First, will it be okay to grow outside somewhere very isolated? I don&#039;t want cops searching for it in helicopters. Also, are deer a threat to weed plants?

				My first piece of advice would be to grow indoors. It is so much easier to handle than having a crop out. <br /><br />Think of all the problems you would have outdoors;<br /><br />travelling<br />massive plant growth<br />soil treatment<br />tons of pests<br /><br />You will still have problems indoors but not as much as outdoors. If growing outdoors is absolutely neccessary I would ensure the crop is in a remote climate, has fences around the permiter of the crop, loads of pesticides, and some good agricultural education.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Any more questions just ask.<br /><br />Dank

				Depending on where you live, I live in an area known for outdoor grows and it&#039;s widely known helicopters routinely fly around looking for outdoor grows, usually in national forests. I don&#039;t how prevalent this may be in your area, but from another forum I&#039;m a regular on I know the outdoor growers spread their plants out more, a few here a few there, so there isn&#039;t a big clearing full of them. If this is on your own property then this is less likely but you also run a larger risk of someone stumbling across it and it automatically being tied to you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of deer eating plants, but expect many plants to either die or have low yields from pests, soil conditions, and improper lighting.<br /><br />I&#039;d seriously consider just doing an indoor grow, even a stealth box.

				Indoors is a lot easier/safer, but outdoors is easy on the electric bill and you can do a lot more volume.<br /><br />Deer LOVE pot plants.&nbsp; Once they find your field you will get the whole fam damily there to chew your shit away.&nbsp; You can get coyote or wolf urine to deter them away from that area, but you have to respray every other day, and after it rains.<br />Don&#039;t use pesticides... unless you enjoy smoking poison.&nbsp; Slug bait around the perimeter of the area is not a bad idea, but avoid spraying anything on your plants at all costs.&nbsp; Only if you find a bad infestation of aphids or spider mites will you have to worry about pests... and then it&#039;s time to break out the lady bugs.<br />Isolation is definitely preferable, as hikers and cops are always an issue outdoors, the hard part is getting your supplies there, working on site, and then retrieving your harvest without getting caught.<br />In the fall cops are in helis looking for grow ops, and patrol cars drive around looking for &quot;abandoned&quot; parked cars along highways and such.<br />As meister suggested, space that shit out if you&#039;re planning on growing anything more than a half dozen plants.<br /><br />Good luck, and stay safe!

				Deer will most certainly destroy your plants, if they don&#039;t eat them they will stamp on them and rip them up and roll on them, like cats on catnip.<br />Most herbivores will eat weed.<br />The more remote your crop the harder it is to get to and from it, wet weed weighs a shitload and you&#039;ll look really suss with massive bin bags of weed hiking through the wilderness :)

				Check out liquid fence for an outdoor grow. <br /><br />They sell it in a pellet type form that lasts the whole grow season and will keep deer and other animals away from your plants. Definitely suggest spacing your plants out in different locations as well. Good luck and be safe.

				Look up plants that repel insects and mammals, and plant them around your cannabis plants. Also, make sure to inoculate the soil with mycorrhizial fungi, which will substantially increase the health and decrease the upkeep of your plants. If I recall, an ebay user BlueMountainOrganics sold very cheap plant tonics that promoted growth of mycorrhiziae.

				Best solution is to start the plants indoors - as early as you can!<br /><br />You can use simple household fluorescent or even the small fluorescent bulbs to start off the seeds. A heated propagator is the best investment other than lights.<br /><br />The idea is to grow seedlings until the weather outdoors is fine. You then need to &#039;harden&#039; the plants. This may be difficult if all you have is your dads greenhouse! <br /><br />As more people here sell clones - all we need do is order in December and you can have an army of clones by May!<br /><br />As for helicopters -they can pick out a pot plant in the garden but they cannot pick out a pot plant that is under some cheap pvc in a garden. <br /><br />Plants which have had a good start will do better outdoors. If the UK was better for growing we would all be heading out to the places cops do not patrol and were teenagers do not meet up or kids explore. <br /><br />Oh - deer hate human hair also!<br /><br />Tell your hairdresser you need hair for an art project or something. Or get your hippy mates to shave the heads for charity. My charity. Basically just about getting 100 grams of Afghan Gold Sela to make me feel better! Sure its not saving the starving but my charity will work!<br /><br />Deer love cannabis but you can spray cannabis with a garlic mixture (home made) this will keep other pests away. Also urinate around the plant. If you need to go the toilet - do so - bury it near the plant. <br /><br />Deer dislike soap - spraying someplace around your garden keeps them away..<br /><br />If you have 3-4 plants growing ina nice spot you can put up four poles (old branch you find) at attach some fishing wire so that there is a barrier around the plants. Deer see the food - but as they go to graze they are spooked by the invisible barrier..<br /><br />Also - hang bars of cheap perfumed soap around the plants. Deer take this smell for humans and as we know wild deer avoid humans.<br /><br />There are many sprays you can make up of strong smelling herbs and spices - these do not harm the plants. if you notice a few leaves chewed spray some pepper on them. <br /><br />Even air fresheners work ok. The ones that last 30 days.<br /><br />Trick is to get the plants trained. Tie down high branches as nothing gives a plant away like a ten foot tall plant with a 3 foot cola on top.<br /><br />When you find the right spot to grow - make sure it gets the max exposure to sunlight. Try planting near nettles as they use the same nutrition as cannabis. If th nettle look green and healthy your plants will. Growing in the middle of such a patch is ideal but be careful to leave no trail. Look for trees you can climb to avoid path beating.<br /><br />You need a water supply.&nbsp; Groundwater may suffice in many areas. Looks for places which always seem to look lush even when its dry. Cannabis will tap out the roots to find ground water but it may need help to establish itself first. This is why uoi usually need to water each plant you put into ground. You need to prepare the hole also. Dig it up in advance - turn it over. Add nutrients if you can afford to go the whole nine yards.<br /><br />If someone wants to start growing - indoors has more of a success rate for newbies. <br /><br />Outdoors you are at the mercy of nature. Cannabis outdoors has less resin glands. They get blown off! But when you have seen a single cannabis plant the size of an automobile, the 20% loss of resin glands means nothing. When the great outdoors delivers up those naturally grown buds and your sitting on a tarp mat with a pile of bud so big you know the two rucksacks won&#039;t hold half of it - you smile and know that the patient hard working farmer has got a good crop.<br /><br />People who live in climates in which growing outdoors is possible ought to always plant a few dozen plants outside. 30% may be lost to animals, insects, disease and humans but you better have a hell of a drying space and be able to book some time off work and have trusted friends to help you bring home the sheaves.

				Ok i have done many outdoor grows , and i live in ny , its a pain but alot cheaper , first off you have to find a place well hidden , you have to buy ferts and nutes for the plants and pre treat the area that you are going to use at least a month before planting , also you need to find a water source to make sure the plants have lots of water incase you run into a dry season , but most important you want to get the right type of marryj to grow , stay away from sativa dom plants , they will take way to long and stretch out way to high and will be harder to hide , i would go with a skunk type strain , it doesn&#039;t grow up but more like a bush ( sideways) when the plant gets to about um lets say four nodes you cut it right in the middle stem that will keep it short and stubby but i will now grow wide and with doing so it will be like a satellite dish and collect more sun ,&nbsp; also would go with skunk with an out&nbsp; door grow because well it smells like a skunk , and a skunk in the woods isn&#039;t that out of place , and yes deer will eat your shit up real quick , what i would do is go to a hunting store or better yet a hunting website and get something like bear piss or something predator like and spray it around the area that you have your plants in , remember to do this often , chicken wire is also great , but sum 2x4&#039;s around your plants and put chicken wire around the wood with a staple gun , your pplants should be done around oct , nov , hope this helps

				Okay I know this is a little late but I&#039;ve germed 5 weed seeds and planted them in florida topsoil. They kaya gold seeds re advertised as &quot;hardy and pest resistant&quot; so I&#039;m hoping most will survive with minimal attention. If I use a liquid fence that should keep animals away, and I&#039;m gonna get better soil for it with my next paycheck. I started germination four days ago and so far none have sprouted. Should I be worried? They are kept pretty moist in 90 degree weather during the day, but they are supposed to be okay in warmer climates
