				Im an Aussie buyer and find myself having a great ongoing relationship with a few local vendors who stock my drug of choice. Then without warning they just vanish after 3 to 6 months of selling heaps of stock. Ive never been ripped off by this or anything, more confused and a also a bit worried for their welfare. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it just a matter of they fear the cops will target them because they are doing so much turnover that they get in and get out? If they can successfully sell for 6 months without being busted why not go for a year, is it paranoia?&nbsp; Or have they made that much money they have opened a legal business an SR has served its purpose?&nbsp; Is it Matrix thats been going for ages? He and his team dont seem concerned, just going from strength to strength.<br /><br />Vendors who just sell weed seem to last longest, is that because they think cops are more likely to target meth and hammer sellers?<br /><br />&nbsp; I know this is all speculation but Id be interested to hear some vendors opinions. I dont sell so I cant know your mind set but isnt the SR method of selling pretty foolproof and something you could do for years non stop (fingers crossed we last that long) with little chance of prosecution?

				Add to the list that they went stealth and they are there but you didn&#039;t relize it.<br /><br />I would bet on vacation / changing vendor name to throw off the heat.<br /><br />Modzi

				Happens to a lot of meth vendors because their grip on their addiction slips.&nbsp; Just can&#039;t keep it together enough to not fuck everything up, eventually.&nbsp; Heisenburg, Starlight Express, Professor Twak, etc..&nbsp; Most people who use regularly end up with that one drug they just can&#039;t seem to keep their grip on, you know.&nbsp; Don&#039;t have to be selling meth to spin out of control.<br /><br />I loved PTwak and SE, by the way -- I mean no insult to them, but it is what it is.

				Probably because they get cocky and then fuck up somehow, ending up either dead, in jail, or on the run.

				What really happens is they find a few loyal private buyers who are getting bulk and then just deal with them exclusively as it&#039;s easier and safer.<br />If you have a good source, there&#039;s gonna be a guy who wants to buy on a reg basis. I&#039;m a vendor here, using a stealth account as all vendors should to prevent FBIz profiling, I sold here for a few months then went private. <br /><br />I still use the system to make deals, using the escrow. But the listings are hidden that&#039;s prob what happened to those guys<br /><br />
