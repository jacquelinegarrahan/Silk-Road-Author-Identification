				Hello, im new here and have been doing my reading to learn how to make purchases properly. i wont be able to make a purchase for about 2 weeks roughly due to having family around the house. seeing as thought i dont know how long bitcoins will take to get into my account etc and because ive never done it before i was thinking of buying some bitcoins through the mail with v1ad1m1r. i was wondering if its safe to leave bitcoins in the silk road wallet for a few weeks? as i swear i read something before about the possibility of coins being mined or something, is that true or will it be ok in the SR wallet until the 7th? thanks!!

				You&#039;ll be fine. Yes, coins are mined. That doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll be &quot;mined&quot; out of your wallet, it&#039;s just how the coins are generated.

				Yeah the only thing you might have a problem with is the volatility of the BTC market. By leaving them in there for a week, you&#039;re effectively investing in bitcoins, and if they go up, you&#039;ll gain buying power but they might go down and you&#039;d have lost money.<br />I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about it, but with the normal volatility of the market, and the whole pirateat40 affair still recent, it&#039;s something to keep in mind.

				I have a question regarding the Silk Road eWallet, if I were to do occasional purchases (say.. once every 2-3 months) on SR, is there any problem with just using my SR bitcoin address/wallet and not making a third party wallet? So effectively I&#039;d be buying bitcoins, getting them in my SR account, and then making the purchase on SR as soon as I see the bitcoins in my account?<br /><br />

				Yes that is pretty safe. Nobody will steal your bitcoins out of your SR wallet if you keep the password secret. The value of bitcoin may increase or decrease a bit, so when you come back they may be worth a little less or a little more, but I don&#039;t expect the difference to be huge.<br /><br />Only if something happens to SR, you may have trouble accessing your coins. The safest way is to store BTC is to have a BitCoin client on your own (virus free and encrypted, preferably Linux) computer.

				I feel safer leaving my BTC in my SR account than on my computer, ie people trying to steal them, computer stolen etc. I trust that my coin is safe in SR 8)
