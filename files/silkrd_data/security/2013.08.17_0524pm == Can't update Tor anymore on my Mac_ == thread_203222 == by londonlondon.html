				hi guys, need some help please :/. want to say first off that I have little - no knowledge in computers. I know how to follow instructions, i know how to use pgp, but that&#039;s pretty much it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been able to upgrade Tor for a while now. I noticed that it is because I have a mac version 10.5 and, for this reason, I can no longer update my Firefox. As a consequence, I can&#039;t update Tor.<br /><br />Does anyone have any viable way to work around this? Any and all feedback would be appreciated =). <br /><br />

				Call up Apple directly, and ask to upgrade to Snow Leopard.&nbsp; It will cost about $16.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your system can handle it, go for Lion, but the thing is you&#039;ll have to get at least SL to get to the app store or run most of the apps nowadays.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will be able to run most the latest apps, because 10.5 is too old.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can get Snow Leopard only from apple usually, most of their stores dont&#039; carry it.&nbsp; Try calling some apple stores in your area, get them to special order it or order directly from apple.&nbsp; &nbsp;A friend of mine had the same problem, is now living the good life! good luck.<br />Another workaround would be to boot from Tails USB or Linux and run Tor off of them, which will work but you really need your OS updated.&nbsp;

				You can also bit torrent the latest version of Mountain Lion..... <br /><br />CLEARNET:<br /><br />Burn-able DVD DMG/ISO file: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7551278/Mac_OS_X_10.8_Mountain_Lion_ISO_Untouched<br /><br />Regular Installer From the App Store:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8604586/Mac_OS_X_Mountain_Lion_10.8.4_%28installer_from_Mac_App_Store%29<br /><br />Use either....

				Oh and assuming you already have a bit-torrent client (Transmission is the best for OS X) click the &quot;Get This Torrent&quot; link on the page with the red horse shoe looking magnet instead of being fooled by all the other download links.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a bit-torrent client, you can get Transmission from: http://www.transmissionbt.com/download/<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t familiar with bit-torrent, then you may just be better off paying for an upgrade copy of OS X from Apple. Just thought I might try to save you a few $$.
