				So recently I updated the latest Tor browser bundle on my mac 10.5.8 but it just crashes on start up and I deleted the last working bundle I had, stupid mistake, and now I have to wait until the next update. So I&#039;m currently running Orbot and Orweb off of my android, can anyone who uses this app offer some advice on what settings are best to keep myself anonymous? I changed some settings myself but it never hurts to double check with you guys.

				I have orbot and orweb on my droid, but don&#039;t trust it at all. Even with all the settings set to where they should be. Can&#039;t remember what guide I followed to do it, but there are some guides out there. It&#039;s that I don&#039;t really know what all else is running that puts me off about it. I&#039;m currently educating myself up so I can flash my phone. I believe I would have more faith if started from scratch like that. Just rooting it seems to me to just make it less trustworthy. <br /><br />You ever consider flashing yours? Anybody got any advice on what to not do?

				Phones already rooted and flashed with xionia, also I always check on the non-exit relay option. Going to go through all of my phone files to make sure nothing is being saved into it as well later on.

				I bet a techy smarty could offer some well bit deserving service if they have the dope info/service in rooting androids. <br /><br />I got some things done but I&#039;m no expert. Anyone here know any links?

				Hey all.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Google&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;XDA Developers (and your phone model)&quot;. They have all info and cool ROMS to unlock, root, flash your cell. <br /><br />I been using Orbot and Orbweb just fine for a long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;But since I just updated to Ice Cream Sandwich, It will not connect anymore.<br /><br />Stock HTC Amaze. <br /><br />Any info or help on Proxy Host or Port&nbsp; settings to get running would be great!!&nbsp; <br /><br />I just haven&#039;t gotten around to researching it yet. This thread reminded me! <br /><br />I am going to do a hard restart and start fresh when I back up apps, ICE got some conflicts with other apps.

				Same problem stinky, since I upgraded to 4.0.3 Orbot will start, occasionally and other times it wont connect at all<br /><br />But even when Orbot does start, Orweb says tor is not running and won&#039;t connect to any sites.<br /><br />Need some more info myself, will wait for some more replies

				At the moment when I try to DL the Firefox Tor add-on it says not compatible with my Firefox version. I have the updated one. <br /><br />I DL the NDBrowser and it comes up fine, BUT it does not say anything about being protected. So I don&#039;t know if I really am. Not sure if I will use this one. <br /><br />I will play with it all more later and see whats up.
