				Anyone have any reliable quick BTC exchange services?<br />There are a bunch listed in wiki but most are either down or are out of BTC. <br />I didn;t realize how much I depended on bitinstant. So many variables to purchasing here - I do have an IRL connection at least for the weekend - No matter what SR can never replace a solid IRL..and this is a huge reason why....cash is cash...you can have all the cash in the world..but if you ain&#039;t got no BTC on SR...then you are SOL!<br />

				Agreed! It especially sucks when a vendor is holding a certain amount for you and you can&#039;t buy because you need to put the remaining monies in...damn bitinstant. If someone who has the knowledge on making a cash deposit into mtgox without bitinstant, please speak up!<br />Thanks everyone!

				I had some coins go missing about 3 weeks ago and am having a terrible time getting the situation resolved.&nbsp; They&#039;ve stopped answering my emails but now at least I know why.&nbsp; Guess it&#039;s time to find another method - Bitinstant has too much going on right now with their new debit card, the probs w/ Barclays, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m so over them ....

				FUUUUUUCK I am short like 1 btc because of the drop, and so I was going to go put more in this morning, but god damn it, bitinstant is down. How do you guys feel about Sugarmama? Turnaround time? I&#039;m hoping they don&#039;t really take a dive before I get more btc in my account. :-|

				Hey - I just wanted to reply to my original posting here - Blueskytraders came through for me BIG time today.<br />Identical to bitinstant using bank deposits.<br />Other SR BTC vendors piggyback on bitinstant as the ones I messaged said &quot;Sorry - the system is down&quot;.<br />Bluesky obviously does not - because the BTC were sent immediately.<br /><br />

Full write-up is on our vendor page, but to summarize: we beat them substantially on the rate, and we like to think our service is Top 5.<br /><br />We lack the usual (100) beside our name in search results because we don&#039;t sell anything illegal. With over 300 successful transactions and a 100% satisfaction rating, we post exact rates and your order confirmation clearly states the amount of bitcoins you&#039;ll receive.<br /><br />Our ‘reserve ratio’ is always 100% or better. SR Administration can easily verify that we have an account balance larger than the total value of the BTC exchange items listed at any time. In this environment, any deceptive practices are easily and quickly revealed.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for bitcoins, drop by and let&#039;s make a deal!

				I was planning on using BitInstant for the first time this weekend, unfortunately they are down.&nbsp; Unfortunately, BlueSky uses Bank of America, and there are no branches near me.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?

				Can someone please tell me if my BTC order is in trouble?<br /><br />I made the order a few days ago, chose major bank branch deposit (trustcash), and paid about an hour ago but the coins have not yet transferred. Support said to wait till the end of the day and call them with my order details if nothing transfers.<br /><br />This might be a problem, I have the bitcoin address the funds were supposed to go to, the emails I used on bitinstant and trustcash (both mailinators, both empty inboxes), the name I used for trushtcash guest checkout, as well as the receipt from the bank. Is this going to be enough?
