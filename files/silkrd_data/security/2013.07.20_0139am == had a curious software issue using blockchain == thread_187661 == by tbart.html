				this happened twice - after the localbitcoins face to face exchange, and bitcoins were in my blockchain wallet, i was using my android smartphone to transfer them to my electrum wallet - while typing in that long string of characters, the displayed image on my android phone was whipping up &amp; down, so that i couldn&#039;t tell what i had typed - i backed out of it before completing it and came back , with it working fine the 2nd time. Okay, i&#039;m thinking, freak computer glitch<br /><br />then today, i went to transfer the btc into my SR wallet, and it did the exact same thing - while typing in the SR address, screen went crazy whipping up &amp; down (just a few inches) but fast enough that there was no way i could tell what had transferred so i backed out, shut electrum down, came back and it was fine. Coins transferred to SR wallet within 60 minutes btw <br /><br />anything i should be concerned about or is that normal?
