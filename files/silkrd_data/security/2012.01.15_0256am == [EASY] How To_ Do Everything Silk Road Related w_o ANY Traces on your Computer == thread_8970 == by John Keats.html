				Tails doesn&#039;t have persistent entry guards. This is a *major* anonymity vulnerability and puts you at a *much* higher risk of being deanonymized by even fairly weak attackers, particularly if you use it for an extended period of time. If you boot tails once a day for a month your risk of being deanonymized by an attacker engaging in a profiling attack is about the same as it would be had you used Tor with persistent entry guards for two and a half years. If you want to be as likely to be deanonymized by a profiling attack in a month as I am in two and a half years feel free to keep using Tails. IMHO Tails is actually probably more of an asset to people who want to trace Tor users than to people who want to avoid being traced. It makes it very easy for its users to greatly increase their vulnerability to one of the most dangerous and widely known attacks against the anonymity of Tor users. And it does this while acting like it is a security focused distro. In all honesty it isn&#039;t even that impressive of a configuration, even if you ignore the absolute deal breaker that it doesn&#039;t have persistent entry guards. It is a security toy with critical flaws in it. That it is suggested by the Tor devs is absolutely stupid, particularly since they will be the first to admit that it indeed *greatly* decreases user anonymity if it is used how it is intended to be used (as a live CD and not loaded from a persistent state via snapshots or similar). They may not admit that it is a security toy though, but it really isn&#039;t at all the ideal configuration. The only place Tails has in your security kit as for use as a live CD if you use random WiFi access points and don&#039;t want your sessions to be linkable to a single entity via the fingerprint your entry guards leave in the logs of the WAP (not many people use the same combination of entry guards, so by using that combination persistently you essentially leave a fingerprint at every WAP you use that will allow for an attacker to link all of your sessions to one entity). That is the only advantage of not having persistent entry guards, and for probably 99% of people using Tails it is entirely outweighed by the extremely real risk of reducing your protection from profiling attacks and making it *much* more likely that a given attacker manages to trace one of your Tor sessions to your actual location. Decide what is more important to you I guess, not having WAP sessions linkable to each other based on entry guards (btw you better also be using a MAC address randomizer between every session, in addition to some other things, or your sessions will be linkable even without an entry guard fingerprint) or not having your location traced in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As long as you hide your usb flashdrive well, and remember to change your boot priority after using this setup, there is absolutely no trace of you being on a computer.

				This is how I do it:<br /><br />I use visualization software. I encrypt virtual HD with truecrypt and I ensure that virtual OS has strong password.<br />This way you can run clean and dirty systems in parallel. <br />There are lots of posts described on this forum on how to properly do it.

Multiple expert level security professionals have weighed in on this matter (including the lead dev of OpenBSD) and you can read all about it in the thread I linked to. The only reason you would even want to consider using full hardware virtualization is if you are using it to isolate applications from the external IP address, and even in this case it brings serious added risks because it makes it easier for someone to pwn the operating environment in your guest VM and spy on your plaintexts, even if they can not get your external IP address. Paravirtualization and OS virtualization are much safer ways to get isolation, and if you want to go full out you should be using physical layer isolation to isolate apps from tor and external IP address.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It would be nice to get a SOP on security, instead of 100 different versions. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes it would. I have written many things like this over the years, adding to my tutorials and adding techniques and fixing mistakes as I learn more. I think my skills and knowledge have increased by such a degree that it is time for a new set of tutorials. I will start work on a comprehensive SOP tutorial set soon, I also welcome haxxtheplanet to join by writing a tutorial for physical layer isolation if he wants. If not I will. But I also will write tutorials for OS virtualization and paravirtualization. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The slurry will continue, until those with knowledge jump down from the perch, and those without start paying attention. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is pretty much what happened in the thread I linked to. Someone claimed that all virtualization is bad and dangerous and that led me to find out that paravirtualization and OS virtualization should be used over full hardware virtualization. I wasn&#039;t aware full hardware virtualization was so insecure before (although I really should have as it is obviously a massive increase to complexity. I guess I was thinking of guest machines as being actual machines, instead of being applications. Bad and wrong way to look at it!). After doing research I found that the poster was about 95% right about what he said, although I did come to a slightly different conclusion than he did (suggesting paravirtualization and OS virtualization over no isolation, although we both agree physical layer isolation is the ideal solution). Many security experts are quoted in the thread and we all reach more or less similar conclusions about many of the points discussed. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">@kmfkewm: from reading your posts, it seems as though you are hacker elite, and nothing is safe.

JFCOAC!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think all the experts have presented the evidence and valid (if different) conclusions from the evidence are also presented. The only point left with some arguement around it is if no isolation is better than using OS or paravirtualization, we all agree physical isolation is best and we all agree that full hardware virtualization is best avoided. This is ten thousands time more true if you are using full hardware virtualization for any security related purpose other than isolation of apps from external IP address. Yes I will make a guide. Yes I am pretty good with computer security. I really shine at traffic analysis and server administration though, I am not an expert on virtualization (although I have talked with some about the issues, you should really read the thread that I linked to)<br /><br />

I&#039;m sure you are more than aware of this and this wasn&#039;t intended to inform you but others who might be reading.<br /><br />Xen in particular does this very well. Well, well enough that very large companies use it on clusters of up to 32 physical hosts and several hundred TB of storage (about 500TB-550TB per cluster simply to give you an idea of the scale) and the one I am thinking of has 11 of these clusters deployed in datacenters across the country. They chose Xen with PVHVM guests for security reasons because of the customers (of theirs) that would be leasing or otherwise using them. These VM&#039;s safeguard a large quantity of very sensitive data (think hospitals and insurance companies and the hosting companies own financial records). I&#039;m not saying virtualization is the most secure solution, what I&#039;m saying is it is used in some very strict environments and if it&#039;s good enough for them and used properly it can add security where there otherwise might be a gap. If it&#039;s acceptable for these types of environments I think it&#039;s quite ok for anyone here. I&#039;m specifically referring to a company who generates over $100 billion a year in revenue so these are no small players and while normally the primary purpose for virtualization is the ability to consolidate your servers on to less hardware, however that does not mean it can&#039;t be used in a secure or otherwise sensitive environment as some security professionals would have you believe. There are also others that believe while it does come with it&#039;s own risks they don&#039;t negate it as being a useful tool. It&#039;s certainly not a new concept and has been around since the late 60&#039;s early 70&#039;s.<br /><br />VirtualBox was never intended to be secure, it was intended to be light and fast and simple to use. This combination of things does not lend itself to being highly secure in any application. Security really isn&#039;t about any one factor alone and people should take this into consideration. I&#039;m not suggesting that you don&#039;t kmfkewm but it&#039;s a matter of a combination of layers and the &#039;whole stack&#039; if you will that ultimately lead to a more secure system of any OS.<br /><br />This being said you can take security as far as you want but at some point there is a point of diminishing returns where even though you may go to great lengths from a technical aspect but thats only one piece of the pie. Physical security and security through obscurity are still major factors in determining if a system is truly &#039;secure&#039;.<br /><br />You may disagree with me, but thats simply my .02btc<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Looker<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPGhBeAAoJEEMAzoKrkXQ+94AH/j1iqkOSYm//0W/9jeHvMXzX<br />JdLe++ueSCsmXYXajyYPbEayv6RyXgyn5vpx3gJ8o8Tk484leM8Bf3hQLXq8R86w<br />rIdXeka2nYWVV2y/z6NANkSpWZ8d8qrseCDxhV8/Gk7YtBfNPnc7+KvqBRYDwm0z<br />ihPnc/5Lw0ItcDdEi6OlUmaXf+VLGdxFfVJsun7QIQLdS1WVq8afrQ+sxdiwN7fm<br />LoB8CIvnS1nnfBijkuflndqeKM6+2VpdyoPmXDpCHRTYS65sPmMqUrqgk0xTziP6<br />goIz1xcoYY+mkZiZce6l4MIVldziMW56VjWbaKmpU7O7Q7e0MCU3Cof5ETVpTxI=<br />=H0dP<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

While I do not agree with the manner in which you commented, there is a lot of truth in your statements. Persistent entry guards are important when wanting to be safe from elite hackers and such, but few people or organizations actually have the resources to commit such in-depth traffic analysis, etc. This setup that I proposed is merely to wipe any traces of your online activity from your machine and to provide good anonymity on the web.<br /><br />However, upon some research, it seems that Liberte addresses many of the security issues of Tails and so I think I&#039;ll rewrite the guide to use Liberte instead. Liberte also has full encryption and a hidden container just like truecrypt so that solves that issue. It seems that Liberte is brand new and its creator is actively engaged in furthering its mission; talk on its forums indicate that he/she will be adding bitcoin support in the next release and furthering development of cables communication (which is absolutely fantastic).<br /><br />Again this guide is to ACTUALLY help new users with a step-by-step process of how to use a secure setup, rather than preach of what they should be doing. There are pros and cons in every system and its up to the user to effectively do his/her research and decide which setup is best for them.

I&#039;m sure you are more than aware of this and this wasn&#039;t intended to inform you but others who might be reading.<br /><br />Xen in particular does this very well. Well, well enough that very large companies use it on clusters of up to 32 physical hosts and several hundred TB of storage (about 500TB-550TB per cluster simply to give you an idea of the scale) and the one I am thinking of has 11 of these clusters deployed in datacenters across the country. They chose Xen with PVHVM guests for security reasons because of the customers (of theirs) that would be leasing or otherwise using them. These VM&#039;s safeguard a large quantity of very sensitive data (think hospitals and insurance companies and the hosting companies own financial records). I&#039;m not saying virtualization is the most secure solution, what I&#039;m saying is it is used in some very strict environments and if it&#039;s good enough for them and used properly it can add security where there otherwise might be a gap. If it&#039;s acceptable for these types of environments I think it&#039;s quite ok for anyone here. I&#039;m specifically referring to a company who generates over $100 billion a year in revenue so these are no small players and while normally the primary purpose for virtualization is the ability to consolidate your servers on to less hardware, however that does not mean it can&#039;t be used in a secure or otherwise sensitive environment as some security professionals would have you believe. There are also others that believe while it does come with it&#039;s own risks they don&#039;t negate it as being a useful tool. It&#039;s certainly not a new concept and has been around since the late 60&#039;s early 70&#039;s.<br /><br />VirtualBox was never intended to be secure, it was intended to be light and fast and simple to use. This combination of things does not lend itself to being highly secure in any application. Security really isn&#039;t about any one factor alone and people should take this into consideration. I&#039;m not suggesting that you don&#039;t kmfkewm but it&#039;s a matter of a combination of layers and the &#039;whole stack&#039; if you will that ultimately lead to a more secure system of any OS.<br /><br />This being said you can take security as far as you want but at some point there is a point of diminishing returns where even though you may go to great lengths from a technical aspect but thats only one piece of the pie. Physical security and security through obscurity are still major factors in determining if a system is truly &#039;secure&#039;.<br /><br />You may disagree with me, but thats simply my .02btc<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Looker<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPGhBeAAoJEEMAzoKrkXQ+94AH/j1iqkOSYm//0W/9jeHvMXzX<br />JdLe++ueSCsmXYXajyYPbEayv6RyXgyn5vpx3gJ8o8Tk484leM8Bf3hQLXq8R86w<br />rIdXeka2nYWVV2y/z6NANkSpWZ8d8qrseCDxhV8/Gk7YtBfNPnc7+KvqBRYDwm0z<br />ihPnc/5Lw0ItcDdEi6OlUmaXf+VLGdxFfVJsun7QIQLdS1WVq8afrQ+sxdiwN7fm<br />LoB8CIvnS1nnfBijkuflndqeKM6+2VpdyoPmXDpCHRTYS65sPmMqUrqgk0xTziP6<br />goIz1xcoYY+mkZiZce6l4MIVldziMW56VjWbaKmpU7O7Q7e0MCU3Cof5ETVpTxI=<br />=H0dP<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Xen is paravirtualization and I suggest using it over anything else other than physical layer isolation. Full hardware virtualization like Virtualbox is where the danger is. I agree that paravirtualization is secure enough, and that it is certainly better to isolate apps from external IP address with paravirtualization than not to isolate apps from external IP address at all. I also recognize that paravirtualization and OS virtualization are fairly common security techniques used by people who are very good at security. I knew virtualization could be used for isolation like this (and it should be if you are not using physical layer isolation), but I didn&#039;t realize that paravirtualization was the best choice or that full hardware virtualization caused a substantial hit to guest OS security before.

Also it would be ill advised to use VirtualBox for any security related concerns in the context of virtualization in general it&#039;s a joke, a toy, not a real virtualization platform. <br /><br />There are other reasons why PVHVM (Paravirtualization security that leverages the acceleration aspects of VT/HVM) is preferred other than security, most notably is performance although with 64 bit OS&#039;s and the newer Westemere chips this gap is closing at an alarming rate but there are also security concerns that as a professional in the industry (if thats in fact what you do) you should look into.

It boils down to this: any attacker can make a hidden service open as many circuits as they want it to. If the attacker has a few nodes on the Tor network, eventually the circuits they force the hidden service to open will be using nodes they own. Entry guards make it so if the hidden service hasn&#039;t selected attacker nodes to enter through, that the attacker can only trace it to its entry guards. Which is fine, other than the fact that after the hidden services entry guards are located the attacker can use a pen register / trap and trace order (or tons of other things, but for feds that will be the easiest route to take) to deanonymize the hidden service. Until Tor starts using multiple chained guard nodes for hidden services they shouldn&#039;t be considered anonymous for more than about a week or two after they are targeted by any competent attacker.

				Hey guys, I&#039;m having trouble with the Tails program.. I know how to import peoples keys and decrypt messages with the text editor.. but I have no idea how to create my own PGP key on there. Do i need to download another program in order to do that? or does tails come equipped with that.

				liberte linux is a good start, much more so than tails in my opinion, but until someone takes on the hassle of cooking a version that includes truecrypt, bitcoin by default, as well as additional crypto modules, if won&#039;t be ready for all SR operations. Its still a 100 miles ahead of whats most popular today - some dos in virtualbox.

				This is a great thread and I would love to see updates from the OP. OK, so my security might not be as tight as the rest of you, but I&#039;m not a computer expert and even I can do this. I like the idea of having the entire OS on a USB stick that I can simply remove and deposit anywhere I want - outside, inside, it doesnt matter. No traces on my main PC then either which works for me.

				Tails is fine if you use it in bridge mode.<br />Same with all other live CDs<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t put Liberte Linux on a USB drive. It leaves history on that drive why not burn to CD then zero history ever.<br />Once again boot it&nbsp; in bridge mode. Or make your own tor bridge with a spare computer lying around and connect to it... now you have plausible deniability why you are using Tor all the time because you&#039;re a democracy enthusiast and decided to offer it to activists around the world.

				Forgot<br />http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/hughes/SecureErase.html<br /><br />I believe only works on IDE and SSD drives, not SCSI<br /><br />You probably have to unplug the power connector to your hard drive, boot it (bios still recognizes it through IDE cable connection) then reattach power connecter once booted. Now can safely wipe the drive<br /><br />Reason is sometimes BIOS/HD hardware locks out during boot and can&#039;t run secure erase on it.<br /><br />Also secure erase is the only proven lab method to destroy all data without using Thermite or something. When you use other wiping tools it doesn&#039;t get rid of bad blocks which are still full of data, or manufacturer protected areas.<br /><br />.... and I wouldn&#039;t use SSD either. so dangerous and nearly impossible to delete anything off them. Also read the problems using Truecrypt on a solid state drive

				PLEASE SOMEONE HELP.&nbsp; I need to figure this out very soon.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading this tutorial by v01d, which is very good, but I can&#039;t quite seem to figure out how to install Liberte on a Mac.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of a beginner to this sort of stuff, and here is what I do not understand:<br /><br />Linux: Copy liberte/setup.sh to a local directory, and run sh setup.sh /dev/XXX as root — providing the unmounted media to which you extracted the archive as the argument. For ext[234] filesystems, copying and unmounting is unnecessary — just run the script directly.<br /><br />I tried copying and pasting in Terminal, but I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m supposed to change &quot;/dev/XXX&quot; to something else.&nbsp; Can anyone clear this up?&nbsp; It would be GREATLY appreciated!

Using secure erase is so easy that you might as well use it since it actually is secure. Also using programs that only wipe single files is almost never secure from forensic recovery. But may be secure from local and state LE.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m just saying that I don&#039;t see what secure erase offers that several other programs that are compliant with the 5220.22-M standard don&#039;t, there are literally dozens of them out there so I would think any 3 pass or even 7 pass (required for SI/TK/GG data destruction caveats) would be sufficient in most cases. But if you&#039;ve attracted enough heat that the FBI is looking to take you down you have a much larger set of problems than what may have been on your hard drive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Secure Erase is firmware that allows the hard drive arm to offset itself by a few degrees to wipe magnetic residue from the edge of the track. Other erase programs can not do this because they lack this firmware component, so they can not off-set the arm and don&#039;t properly erase magnetic residue from the edge of the track. Of course they will erase some, but large data fragments can still be recovered even after 35 pass wipes.

				Ok, I know I should not enable flash or reveal any personal information while using the TOR browser (I&#039;m on a mac and the browser is called Aurora).<br />BUT, here are my questions<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Can I go ahead and open up my usual browser (in this case Safari) and browse the web as normal if SR is slow?&nbsp; So in other words, if I had Safari open I might be entering personal information and running flash and just browsing as normal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is there any type of bleed over?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I am explaining this right but part of me thinks that as long as I make sure that the TOR browser information is closely guarded that it shouldn&#039;t matter if I have a seperate browser open and browsing as normal.&nbsp; But another part of me thinks that I better ask someone with some actual knowledge.<br /><br />Thanks for any responses.<br />klaaat21<br />

				BTW, I&#039;m on a mac and I created an Encrypted Disk image and placed any files that deal with SR on that encrypted image.&nbsp; For example, the TOR browser is inside the encrypted folder and even my GPG Keychain access.&nbsp; &nbsp;It occurted to me that even with the SR stuff hidden away that the gpg keychain could be access pretty easily and I had a bunch of SR members keys stored there with of course their usernames.&nbsp; Might as well put the keychain in the encrypted&nbsp; folder.<br /><br />If you want to make an encrypted folder (that mounts like an external drive) it is done through disk utility.&nbsp; Make sure that you choose the encryption option and do NOT save the encryption password to your keychain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Save it in your head<br />

				Quite well known story for IT security ppl, but if you want an idea of how far the FBI etc will go to nail someone then read this article:<br /><br />http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/03/features/the-card-master?page=all<br /><br />Interestingly I originally found the US version of it online, and it omits the detail on the last couple of pages about how they circumvented his local system security by dumping the RAM contents.<br /><br />Of course bear in mind that most law enforcement agencies do have financial constraints, so your actual risk is proportional to your estimated criminal turnover. I&#039;m not saying dont bother to make an effort to be secure, but if you are a small time buyer don&#039;t be put off if you can&#039;t tick every box the experts suggest. For anyone looking to write a definitive guide I&#039;d like to see it split into sections - e.g. the essentials everyone should do for basic protection, and then advanced techniques to be applied as your risk level increases. For IT novices there are some more advanced things that if done wrongly can actually make security worse (not a great example but tracking DCNs through Tor for a start)

Is he talking about wanting to use your normal operating system after liberte has been setup? If so, then<br /><br />1) If you have already set up Liberte, BUT do not currently have the usb plugged in, then how does the liberte boot screen pop up without the usb plugged in? Or is this quote JUST talking about booting the normal hard drive WHILE the usb is plugged in?<br /><br />2) If the usb is in boot position #1, and your normal hard drive is in boot position #2, then wouldn&#039;t your computer just automatically try to boot from the USB by default; and if the USB is not plugged in, then automatically boot from your normal hard drive without any input from the user?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

I&#039;ve often had problems in windows solved by fresh installs.<br /><br />@markwest, Liberte is setup for wifi from the outset, you shouldn&#039;t have any problems with that. Security wise, it depends on how you&#039;re using Liberte I guess. If you are afraid of packet snooping neighbors, then use Ethernet, but if you want doubleplusgood security, you should be using Liberte at public wifi, hacked wifi, otherwise anonymous wifi. At that point, it is next to impossible to convict you in the court of law, even if a lot of our assumptions fall down flat e.g. Bitcoin, TOR aren&#039;t compromised somehow. Highly highly unlikely, but it&#039;s nice to be physically certain of these things.

You&#039;re probably right, could be hardware incompatibility, but sometimes with liberte people assume it&#039;s not working when in actual fact the screen turned off since it was taking so long to encrypt/process etc

I haven&#039;t changed any settings at all, so I&#039;m not sure why this would have happened. I even tried re-formatting and doing a clean install of Liberte on the flash drive, and nothing. I do know the flash drive is working, and I know that the computer recognizes it because I am able to view its contents from my regular OS, but I am stumped as to why the option to boot from USB has suddenly disappeared. Maybe it&#039;s just not being recognized by the BIOS.... but I have no idea, that&#039;s a little beyond me. any advice?

In your case, if you have a decent internet connection, you might upload your stuff to some manner of cloud service for safekeeping. However, you might have too much data for that, in which case you&#039;ll need to borrow an external HD or something. Also, you will need to buy a USB flash drive to run Liberte from.

Put the files you want onto the external, and a copy of Liberte (zip) onto the flash drive. Format and overwrite your HD (once is enough) from a live-OS (not Liberte, it&#039;s not ideal for this job, so you&#039;ll want 2x USBs) from a USB using some overwriting program. Then do a full clean install of your desired OS.<br /><br />It&#039;s just easier to do this, than to cover every conceivable leak in your security, all kinds of OS records are kept in places you&#039;d never even think of. I&#039;ve never heard of anybody recovering data from an overwritten HD. Some geeks think it&#039;s possible, but they&#039;ve been reading too much sci-fi. There&#039;s no actual empirical evidence you need to overwrite more than once. But yes, overwrite you must if you wish to have maximum security.<br /><br />Note: If you are a just a buyer buying small quantities, then this could be overkill. But most people prefer peace of mind.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve read all 9 pages and decided to scrap using tails and I&#039;m now use Liberte on a usb (after wiping the usb with eraser).&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is my question:<br /><br />After logging out of my Liberte session and rebooting back into windows, when I look at the usb (start&gt;computers&gt;usb drive) why do I only see the zipped file of Liberte and no other types of files or folders associated with Liberte, as I did with Tails?<br /><br />Where did Liberte install to? I downloaded the zip file, put it on the root of my usb and unzipped and installed everything without issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m very impressed with the great amount of knowledge on this forum, and I spend (try to) more time reading than posting.&nbsp; Thanks for the great info guys/girls!
