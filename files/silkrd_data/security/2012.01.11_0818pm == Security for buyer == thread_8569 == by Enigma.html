				Hello SR members,<br /><br />I am new to Silkroad and the .onion network and try my best to find about the security measures. I was thinking of buying something off SR, but not without the proper protection :) What is the minimum I need to safely buy off SR?<br /><br />1. How can I set up an USB stick that i can boot TAILS OS from &amp; save any neccesary things on (GPG, PGP, bitcoin wallet, etc.)? (Preferably for Mac OS X but Windows is okay too)<br /><br />2. In order to use PGP encryption, does this only work vie email or will i get an encrypted text block that i can &quot;paste&quot; anywhere?<br /><br />3. What programs do i need in order to buy from SR and, if neccesary, contact the vendors and where do i get them? (Sorry for this question but i cant find a &quot;newbie tutorial&quot; for SR :D)<br /><br />My guess is that i need: GnuPG, something to store Keys &amp; passwords in, bitcoin wallet (?). Anything else?<br /><br />Once again, sorry for these questions but i feel a little overloaded with new info.<br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance!! :)<br /><br />P.S. If i use a paysafecard to get bitcoins, do the bitcoins get transferred to my wallet or directly to my SR account?

I would recommend doing this on windows. Download the .zip from: http://dee.su/liberte<br />and extract it on your blank usb. Then run the .bat file in the liberte folder. Then boot up from that USB (doing so is different depending on what computer you are doing it from.) And set a STRONG encryption password. Something long and as random as possible, but still something you can remember. Because if that gets broken you are Fucked capital f. Now you have a persistent OS that has everything you need.<br />Go to GPA and set up a GPG key pair.&nbsp; Set a very strong password on that as well.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In order to use PGP encryption, does this only work vie email or will i get an encrypted text block that i can &quot;paste&quot; anywhere?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You will be using GPG, and this is what you do:<br />1. Make your key pair (what you should have done above)<br />2. Import someones public key. You&#039;ll see them on vendor pages, they are the really long strings of letters and numbers. To import copy and paste the whole thing and create a new file anywhere and save it as whatever.asc and go to GPA. Click import and select that file. Voila.<br />3. Now open clipboard in GPA and type whatever you want to say and hit encrypt.<br />4. Select who you want it to be encrypted for and tick the box that says sign and select your key from below.<br />5. Send them your public key if they don&#039;t have it (go to GPA hit export and save it as mykey.asc, open it and copy and paste that and send it to whoever you are trying to talk to. Without it they cant decrypt it)<br />6. Send them the encrypted message.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

				Woooah, thanks man!! Your post really clears up things!! Thanks, thanks, thanks! :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll follow your steps and get back to you!<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably use the PSC -&gt; SR Vendor -&gt; Bitcoins method. Do the coins land in the Instawallet or on my SR account?<br /><br />

Research a vendor before you dive in. <br />They will go to your SR account or any bitcoin address you specify. You should just have them send it to your SR address.<br /><br />Also for instawallet when you go to the site make sure to save the url you get for that wallet. Without that URL you lose that waller and any bitcoins in it.<br />

				So the cops are going to do all that work to bust a small pot deal, or whatever?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; They&#039;ll just outlaw bitcoins this year in the US and try to make a more corporate/state controlled internet.&nbsp; If somebody gets busted it&#039;s because it was detected in the mail, otherwise, this is totally safe.

				Thanks for the tips! I agree, rather safe than sorry; although this might be like tying your shoes wearing a helmet. :)<br /><br />I managed to set up Liberté Linux on my USB and boot my PC from it. Now I&#039;m facing my next dilemma. How do I connect to the internet? :D When I was experimenting with TAILS, all possible Wi-Fi networks showed up - but not on Liberté. Does built-in Wi-Fi work with Liberté? It should since I&#039;ve read about using public Wi-Fi on http://dee.su/liberte . Any help is greatly appreciated! :)

				You don&#039;t have to download any of the programs off of silkroad, honestly I would advise against it. Just go to the real site and everything you need is free; most of the virtual goods are virus&#039;s here....and are free programs.

I&#039;m not exactly sure how you would fix that. You&#039;d probably have to drop to terminal and go root and try something like ndiswrapper. Maybe you should just stick with tails or look into getting a usb network adapter compatible with Liberte.<br /><br />Or go wired.

				Thanks for your reply SecuritySolution. I&#039;m a newbie to Linux and thus what you have written seems like a great task for me :D Could you maybe go into further detail? Maybe a Step-by-Step guide? Or do you have a link to such a guide?<br /><br />P.S. To connect to the internet via Ethernet is it secure to skip the router and connect straight into the box dangling from the wall? The box that also connects to the stationary phone. Or does the router somehow encrypt my traffic?
