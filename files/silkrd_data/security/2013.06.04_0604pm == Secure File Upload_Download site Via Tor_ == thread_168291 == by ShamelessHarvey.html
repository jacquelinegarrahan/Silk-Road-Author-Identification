				Howdy,<br /><br />I recently had it requested that I start providing an ebook format of my novel updates so that people with crap eyesight can read it on their kindle or what not. While making the ebook is trivial, I am a bit lost when it comes to finding a place to securely upload it and have it downloaded via TOR.<br /><br />Now, I did try searching the forum first. But my searches were coming up with a whole lot of unrelated info.<br /><br />Anyone have a suggestion for me? Sorry for my ignorance.&nbsp; <br /><br />

I haven&#039;t seen mention of a service for that, although there ARE at least two 4chan-style boards on the tor network, I (somewhat) expect that they use some non-clearnet source for their (well, lets face it, if they aren&#039;t doing it on 4chan they&#039;re probably here for CP.) debauchery, but chances are you probably don&#039;t want to associate yourself with that service.<br /><br />What style service are you looking for? A rapidshare type service, or an imgur type service? There are libraries on Tor, which accept uploads.<br /><br />http://xfmro77i3lixucja.onion/<br /><br />I&#039;ve used this one myself, for obtaining books for reading. I&#039;ve not used it to upload though. It does have quite a large selection... and its been around for a reasonable time. As far as for downloading, no registration is required, and I don&#039;t see usernames on the site so I presume uploading is also without mind to identity. There is a login (and registration) ability, so I presume to manage book(s) you will need to do that. Otherwise, I don&#039;t have any further advice.
