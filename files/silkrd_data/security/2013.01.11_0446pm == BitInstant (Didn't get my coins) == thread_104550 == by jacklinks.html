				I placed two orders yesterday. One at 12 P.M which was in my wallet in under an hour. I then placed another order about an hour later and received the same email saying that the order was successful. I still have no Bitcoins almost 1 day later. When I call it goes to their voicemail so I left a message. I have emailed them as well with no response... Does anyone know a way to reach Bitinstant? This was a $500 MoneyOrder and money isn&#039;t easy to come by for me. Hope I&#039;m not fucked

				Ahhh, having an experienced user around is like a warm blanket on a cold day&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry links, you&#039;ll get your BTC. I&#039;ve only purchased a dozen times from Bitinstant so I&#039;m no expert by any stretch of the imagination, but one time an order of a couple hundred got hung up for well over an hour so I called, got a rep right away, and after giving my info *poof*, there was the email stating that it had been processed &amp; the coin was in my wallet looking glorious (I hope most of you still remember the first time you saw Bitcoins in your wallet - don&#039;t tell me it wasn&#039;t a near orgasmic experience). <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it was coincidence or if they had to do something from their end; I can&#039;t remember her exact explanation because I was so relieved - it was my first purchase &amp; I was afraid that I was being scammed.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity (because I&#039;m only here to tell my experience and not give advice) but did you send the coin into a wallet or straight into your SR account?<br /><br />Please let us know what happened, jacklinks - what the problem and solution was. Some of us are still trying to become experts at troubleshooting issues such as these&nbsp; ;)

				i&#039;m having a problem with bitinstant as well.&nbsp; i sent $250 to bitinstant through zip zap this past monday, january 7th.&nbsp; instead of issuing a coupon for mt. gox, they sent an email to me saying it had been directly deposited into my mt. gox account.&nbsp; the problem is they reversed two numbers in my account on mt. gox so the money was sent to the wrong account.&nbsp; mt. gox froze the deposit so the cash couldn&#039;t be used by the wrong account, but here we are almost a week later and neither one of these companies has been able to solve this.&nbsp; one says it&#039;s the other&#039;s responsibility and that i should be patient.&nbsp; is there really a telephone number to call for either of these companies?&nbsp; i&#039;m really annoyed that neither one is solving this.&nbsp; any other experiences?

				I&#039;m having the same problem as igor, except the the time frame is a lot longer. I don&#039;t want to go into details as I&#039;m afraid that I might &quot;jinx&quot; any chances of ever seeing my bitcoins, but same story: zipzap/wrong Mt Gox account number (don&#039;t know how this happened) froze money, both company&#039;s saying it;&#039;s the others responsibility, countless emails, countless excuses. Someone else on these forums has the same&nbsp; problem, but their issue is older then mine by two months. They were told the issue would be resolved by Jan 31. Mt Gox told me 2 weeks ago that several pepole have the same issue. I&#039;m prety pissed, but what can I do? I don&#039;t to trash bitinstant, as their service is appreciated and they are usually quite responsive to problems, but this problem has been going on for a long time.

				I quit using bitinstant because of this problem. Your second order is stuck. It happened to me 6 times before I quit using them because I was tired of the delays(up to a week for $500). Each time I tried to call, it would ring and ring and ring then finally go to voicemail. I sent them emails each time, and they told me the SAME thing every single time. My order was stuck, and it has been forwarded to the technical support team.

				They had huge problems over the last couple of days, but things are supposedly better now.&nbsp; I was waiting on a transfer I made on Tuesday, and it just came through, with the processing fee refunded.&nbsp; In another thread, someone recommended going to (clearnet) bitcointalk.org and message the BitInstant CEO there.&nbsp; I did, and you can tell they&#039;re in problem-solving mode over there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I&#039;m just waiting for SR to catch up.

				Oh damn, well aren&#039;t you lucky? Lol. They never offered me a single thing to make up for me waiting on my coins. This also hasn&#039;t just been going on for the past few days. I have been having issues with this since back in October. I really don&#039;t see why it would take 4 months to fix one problem. If I never sent them emails about my problems, I feel like I would have never received the money because they didn&#039;t seem like they were in a hurry what-so-ever for a order that was placed days ago.

				Yep, they seem to be having problems lately.&nbsp; I know they are an honest company and if your patient you will get your coins.&nbsp; Apparently, they never answer their phone and never answer emails either. <br /><br />I hear the best way to get their attention is actually go on the bitcointalk forums and post under their customer service thread saying you never got your transaction and give out your zipzap number.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see hundreds of other posts with people that have the same issue.&nbsp; Yankee, the owner of bitinstant, usually always takes care of you in a day or two.&nbsp; It sucks that it seems to be such a pain in the ass getting coins from them lately but they&#039;ll come through.<br /><br />* clearnet warning *<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=hq09bbm79ectr2ltj5sn22mp74&amp;topic=128314.0<br /><br />That&#039;s their customer support thread and where you actually have a chance of getting helped, unlike sending emails and making phone calls.

I&#039;ve probably made a dozen or so transactions since October, and every time it gets stuck, I get that same damn answer.... &quot;Your order has been forwarded to the technical support team for manual transfer.&quot; That&#039;s why I moved to bank transfers. Much faster.

				So like I was saying on the other thread, the support staff finally got back to me a few hours ago after the steady stream of more and more abusive support requests I made over the course of 6 hours prior to that, basically to ask that I not spam them over and over again with ONE stalled order. Which really if they knew anything about customer service, didn&#039;t have to happen had they replied the first time about the &quot;server delay&quot; and stall for many users. They assured me though that my order would be the first to be pushed through and she would do it herself if she could but doesn&#039;t have those sorts of skillz would would follow up later to ensure tech support took care of it blah blah blah.<br /><br />Not even 10 minutes later $CHACHING$. Wallet is stuffed.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Moral of the story? Spam them with as many abusive support requests as possible. I think the key is to be a total nuisance that they just want to get rid of by handling first. Use both the live support request and the form support. Tell them they are incompetent selective scammers and ask them what the BBB thinks of them. Put all this stuff in the subject header. Anyway, I think that should really be the strategy going forward until at least they can get a competent support staff that knows to write a personalized reply if they have having server stalls to those waiting on cash.<br /><br />Fuck it&#039;s the least they could do. <br />

				Yeah, when you place two orders with them within a 24 hour period, the second transaction usually gets &quot;stuck&quot; due to their fraud filter.&nbsp; You need to make sure you&#039;re using different amounts, different btc deposit addresses, etc. each time to try and avoid this.&nbsp; It&#039;s because their system sees two very similar transactions for the same amount, or going to the same wallet, and the system thinks the second one is an accidental duplicate.<br /><br />Also be aware that when this happens, they state that they will refund you their 4% fee as well .... so make sure you ask them to do this.

				Yep, unfortunately they&#039;ve made it so that it is pretty much necessary to use fake info if you&#039;re wanting to do 2 transactions within a 24 hour period and not have to deal with the second one getting stuck every time.&nbsp; :\

				so I&#039;m stuck in the same boat.<br />I&#039;ve used Bitinstant for almost a year now without any issues until this week.<br /><br />made my deposit on Monday using the same method as always: Bitinstant -&gt; Moneygram/CVS -&gt; bitcoin address.<br />this usually results in payment within hours. usually before I even get home to check, the money is always there in a timely fashion.<br /><br />but this week it&#039;s already been days (Monday to Thursday) and my wallet is still empty.<br />I&#039;ve contacted MoneyGram and ZipZap Inc, who said that the problem is with Bitinstant. the transaction was approved by MoneyGram, received by Zip Zap, but BitInstant has failed to deposit. the lady over @ Zip Zap said that Bitinstant has been acting strange recently; just the past few days.<br /><br />she said that I&#039;m not the first person to call looking for a lost / late deposit from Bitinstant.<br />so I&#039;ve sent email and voicemail to Bitinstant, I also posted my complaint to the official Bitinstant Support thread that someone else linked to.<br /><br />what happens now?<br />I just cross my fingers and hope someone gets back to me? because right now I&#039;ve got over 100 dollars that are simply lost in the cosmos. I really don&#039;t want to have to involve the Better Business Bureau or other legal proceedings...
