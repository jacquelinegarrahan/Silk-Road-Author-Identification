Obviously I&#039;m not going to write passwords and shit that actually links to my account or gaining access to create new evidence from my computer.<br /><br />Can I write about ordering things? People that I&#039;ve taken things with? What things I&#039;ve taken?<br />I always write trip reports too.<br />If I write at the start of my diary this is all non-fiction and nothing is real does this void it as evidence?<br />Or should I write it with a &quot;swim&quot; approach like forums do?

I have posted about this elsewhere on the forums if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />V.

The reason I chose this format is because it can&#039;t contain malicious code unlike PDF&#039;s and word documents!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll canonise me just yet but I really do enjoy reading about old school ciphers and while they&#039;re not a patch on more modern methods, they can be very useful.<br /><br />Firstly you may end up in a situation where you don&#039;t have access to a computer and need to send a message safely. Also, you can use a book cipher or similar to protect a password or the location of a file on the internet so it doesn&#039;t have to be either/or. <br /><br />All the best and let me know if you have any questions.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I started writing in my diary after I discovered SR, writing about how amazing this place was, and my discovery of MXE.&nbsp; Then I thought about it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a direct confession, in your hand writing.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably not a good idea.&nbsp; But even if one were to get busted, would they really search your whole house?&nbsp; Look through everything?&nbsp; Why would they even look for a journal if it wasn&#039;t out lying around?&nbsp; Maybe I should rip out those pages and burn them just in case.

				Personally I would just write anything illicit in a code. <br /><br />Silkroad = Bakery<br />Bitcoins = Dollars<br />Your DOC = Raisin bread <br /><br />etc<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you can come up with something more creative. Only downside is that if someone does confiscate your diary and read it they will think you are a boring cunt :P

				Thank you that add on works perfectly! This is very handy to me, much appreciated! Yeah I like the nice traditional looking symbols etc!<br /><br />Just start writing it in a way you&#039;ll understand don&#039;t burn your memory&#039;s! MXE and me fell out when I decided to snort 250mg and it possessed me for a good amount of time and convinced me I was dead! Fun stuff thought but I try not to touch RC&#039;s<br /><br />Yeah haha!!! I&#039;m sure going to be visiting the bakery a lot and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve got a problem with those iced buns you know!?<br /><br />Hah I think I would of had to use code name - Datura for my headmistress! She didn&#039;t look quite as pretty mind but I&#039;m sure you get the idea

				A quick and easy cipher I used for personal notes as a kid, was to write in groups of three and using vowels to represent spaces between words. <br /><br />Vowels themselves were replaced alternately with the letters before and after them. For example the word &quot;and&quot; would be &quot;znd&quot; the first time it&#039;s written and &quot;bnd&quot; the next time and so on. <br /><br />For example:<br /><br />Meet me at the cemetery at dusk.<br /><br />would become:<br /><br />MDF TAM DOZ TUT HFA CDM FTD RYE BTI DTS KOO<br /><br />Of course it would be shockingly easy for anyone who has read the above book to crack but it fooled the teachers at my school :)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Hah! Did you learn to be able to write it pretty fluently? I think it&#039;d take me a while to write things out like that until I had the hang of things

Even if you did find it necessary to write down the page number for instance, only you would know the book and correct sequence. Of course this isn&#039;t vulnerable to frequency analysis as you&#039;re setting the spacing between words.<br /><br />If you want to encode actual names, places dates and so forth it really comes down to the length of the key text and whether the characters are written in a linear way - firstly there&#039;s no requirement that the key text necessarily be in English(!) - For instance in German while the letter E is also the most common as in English on average it makes up a staggering 13% of any average text!<br /><br />You can also make the cipher more secure by writing your own key text. This needn&#039;t be anything suspicious - when I was at University for instance I used my dissertation on World War 2 as a key text. The mixture of two languages and the large amounts of citations and serial numbers increases its strength considerably.<br /><br />I don&#039;t of course mean to downplay the importance of mastering GPG and disk encryption software like Truecrypt but pen and paper ciphers can be extremely secure if used correctly and in tandem with more modern techniques.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
