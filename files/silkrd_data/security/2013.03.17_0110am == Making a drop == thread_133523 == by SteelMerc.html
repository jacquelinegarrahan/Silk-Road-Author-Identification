				I know that one of the safest ways to receive packages from SR is through a drop address. I&#039;ve been thinking about making one myself, and was wondering if anyone had any information on the process.<br />Is it an instant thing, does it cost, etc.<br />Thanks guys&nbsp; :)

				If you are in the US (seems this would work in other countries too) go downtown to where people are in need of money give a guy who has a driver&#039;s license and secondary ID some cash ($40 or $50 works for me) and you both go into a privately owned (I&#039;d stay away from United States Postal Service-they aren&#039;t open 24 hrs. a day) place like the UPS store with mailboxes. The cheapest place that I have found have been NOT chain stores like UPS, a small mom and pop place. The prices average about $15/month for a small box up to around $30/mo for a larger box, plus there&#039;s a deposit of $10 for key and another $10 for a key to the store so you can go into the store at 3 am if you like. <br />I like to pick people who appear not to own a car, and go to the other side of town and get these people. And I don&#039;t let the mail sit there longer that it needs to be. Get a throw away phone that you only use for this app, and give the number to the lady who gives you the key so that she can call you when a package arrives. <br />Easy, peasy.

				thats a terrible idea no offense. just becuase you use someone elses id does not mean you cant get in trouble if LE sits on the box they just wait for you to walk out with the pack in hand. now your hit with another charge for fraudulent id. not to mention you cant just find some guy with an id, it has to look like you to get the people in the store to think its you. Have you actually done this or did you see it in a drug movie? This has so many holes its not even funny. first rule, never get your hands dirty. how about you pay that person without a car to open a box and recieve the pack? thats safer than what you listed above but still not the best idea.

				Anything can go bad. <br />Unless you are talking volume, I don&#039;t think LE is going to drop everything and stake out of mailbox. Unless&nbsp; you&#039;re getting investigated anyway. <br />I&#039;m more concerned about a dealer getting busted someday, and he&#039;s got these messages on his computer. I wouldn&#039;t want one of those messages to be my address. <br />Yes, I did do the other guy&#039;s ID. It worked for a year, I got a lot of stuff that I&#039;m no longer even slightly worried about getting tracked. The place went out of business, but it&#039;s for the good anyway. I plan to do the same soon. <br />I&#039;m not worried about looking like the person with the ID. The owner&#039;s don&#039;t care, as long as they get their money. The lady of course realized I was the one using the box later, when I showed up. <br />What I did can be duplicated by anybody, it&#039;s easy, fairly cheap. The fake ID idea is great, if you know a good place to get one. I heard silk road people sell them here (actually that&#039;s how I found silk road, a journalist wrote a article. He ended and said that the ID was ok, not perfect, and would probably work for somebody under 21 who wanted to buy alcohol) A problem is that the fake ID people usually do a bunch of different types, all over the world, and somebody who knows all the features of a legitimate ID, like when you take a airline flight, probably wouldn&#039;t be fooled)<br />Another reason I like my idea is sometimes the &#039;perfect is the enemy of the good&#039;. Doing anything other than giving your own address is better than not.<br />I&#039;d stay away from the &#039;big&#039; stores like UPS. The owners of the small stores are (IMO) grateful for the business and it&#039;s cheaper in every case too.

				Find a way to jam all GPS and radiowaves in the entire block radius ... easier said than done.&nbsp; But you should consider bringing a bag lined with something that will block electromagnetic waves and things like that, that way when they put their gps sensor in the box, you should disappear within mass transit like a shopping mall or something and escape
