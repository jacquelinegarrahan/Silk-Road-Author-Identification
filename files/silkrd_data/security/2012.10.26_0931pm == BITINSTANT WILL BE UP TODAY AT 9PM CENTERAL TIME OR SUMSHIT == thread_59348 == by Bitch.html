				It seems to me that if one were really in need of BTC fast, one could buy them UN-anonymously, but then bounce the BTC to several different instawallets that are accessed only with Tor, and ending eventually in your SR account.<br /><br />Remember, buying BTC is legal.

				So...bitinstant has been up for a couple hours for me and seeing that the bank is open for a couple hours tomorrow morning in my area, I was trying to make a bitinstant order this evening. I always deposit my cash through bitinstant at a bank into mtgox. I was finishing up my order when it takes me to the trustcash page. It&#039;s now requiring me to make an account. (which i&#039;ve never had to do before)... Just above where I need to plug in an email and password for this new account it says &quot;Payment type undefined, please contact support.&quot; Anyone know what this is all about?? Should I actually contact support? Would it do any good since it&#039;s a friday evening??<br />If it&#039;s not one thing, it&#039;s another... :/<br />Thanks everyone for staying on top of what&#039;s going on and helping all of us!!

				Well, I just had a successful transaction using bitinstant. All told, coins took about 2 hrs to show up in my SR account (very happy about that, after reading a lot of threads talking about recent long delays). I set up a mt gox account, and used the CVS option. Transferred to an instawallet account, then onto SR. Everything was successful and quick thankfully...wasn&#039;t sure quite what to expect. :)

But honestly it was not materially different that bitinstant&gt;SR address.<br /><br />I set up a mtgox account, which gave me an account number there. I used that account number to create a transfer order at bitinstant: CVS&gt;mtgox. I took that information to CVS and used the moneygram phone to complete the transaction and paid for the order at the register. I went back home, and the correct dollar amount showed up in my mtgox account right away. This is new to me, but I guess since mtgox is an exchange, you have to purchase btc&#039;s from other members? So I used the USD that was in my mtgox account to purchase btc at the current rate of $10.15/btc (that&#039;s the main reason I didn&#039;t wait to see if bitinstant would add back the option to send directly to an address, I wanted to lock in this low price). The btc immediately appeared in my mtgox account. I created an instawallet account, and transfered the btc from mygox to instawallet. They showed up immediately; there was a 20 minute delay before they were verified and ready to send on to my SR account. After about 20, I sent them on to SR, and they showed up about an hour later.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have to provide any personal information to create the mtgox account. There is an option to get &quot;verified,&quot; but that was not necessary for what I did. My transaction was rather small, so I would read up on that to make sure you don&#039;t HAVE to get verified to transfer larger amounts.<br /><br />So, all in all a smooth transaction. Really glad I didn&#039;t have to wait days like some SR members recently. But hopefully bitinstant will add back the option to send directly to an address, just because a few less steps are involved.

				I had also previously been using the bitinstant straight to my SR bitcoin address method, changing my address after each transaction. It worked flawlessly. <br /><br />Today for the first time I created a mt gox account and used Walmart(MG)&gt;Mtgox option. The money showed up in mt. gox immediately, then i bought the coins on mt. gox, and transfered to my SR btc address, this took about 45 minutes. All is well!
