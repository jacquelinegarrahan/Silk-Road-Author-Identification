				ok... this might sound dumb, but i&#039;ve made 12 transactions... and i haven&#039;t ordered in a week and my high ass can&#039;t get GPG right to get this order in... i&#039;v tried several times and the vendor has been so patient.<br />&nbsp;<br />here is what i have tried...<br />i type my address blah blah in the text edit( oh ya i have a mac) <br />then i insert my priv. key and then highlight it all... choose the vendors name/email.. sign/add to recpients it then encrypt.<br />i get two public keys out of that.. i copied it all and told him to try it all together then one indivually..( after the first time it didn&#039;t work, same method just told him to try it that way)<br />didn&#039;t work.<br />(but i think this is what i usually do, i just give them the first key and it works?)(is it him?)<br />then i typed my address blah blah and then highlight it and encrpyt it to his name(without inserting my key) <br />then sign it/add to recpeinets and send...( told him same process as before..try it all together, then try each key indiviually)<br /><br />didn&#039;t work.<br /><br />so now i just typed my address blah blah, highlight it, and encrpyt it.. and this time i did not sign or add to recipents..<br />sent both keys, and told him same process, all together, then individually)<br />not sure if this worked, still waiting on a reply.. like wtf<br /><br />can someone help me? or let me try test runs til they tell me i got it right?! all i want is this hash!<br />wtf is wrong with me why can&#039;t i get it?? :o 12 transactions only to get to this point again??

				Sounds like you&#039;re on Windows so I can&#039;t help there. It took me a few hours of trial and error to get it set up on Mac. In the meantime I used privnote for some things.I know it is a weak substitute for GPG but better than nothing. https://privnote.com/

				What&#039;re you doing inserting your private key anyhow?&nbsp; That&#039;s for you and no one else.&nbsp; If anyone gets your private key they can intercept the encrypted messages meant for your eyes only and read it.<br /><br />1. Type out your message<br />2. Insert your public key if you want (you can just send this clear text, it shouldn&#039;t matter anyway as it&#039;s public)<br />3. Encrypt it using THEIR public key<br />4. Send it over<br />5. They decrypt it using their private key<br /><br />Once they read the message and want to send you something back they do the same encrypting their message with your public key.<br /><br />Then you decrypt it using your private key.

Insert your public key if you want (you can just send this clear text, it shouldn&#039;t matter anyway as it&#039;s public)<br />3. Encrypt it using THEIR public key<br />4. Send it over<br />5. They decrypt it using their private key<br /><br />i did all that :o do i sign it? and do i add to recpients?<br />and which key do i send<br /><br /><br />i&#039;m so baffled...i don&#039;t get it..... i&#039;ve done this before and now it&#039;s not working... with two vendors so it&#039;s not them..it&#039;s me..like what the hell... i hope i can figure it out tonight so it will be shipped tomorrow :-\

				I use Windows myself.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to sign it but you can if you want.&nbsp; Signing it will just sort of prove that the message came from you and not someone else pretending to be you.&nbsp; Whether or not you sign it will not affect confidentiality.<br /><br />As for adding recipients, you probably do.&nbsp; On Windows, I have to add their public certificate to my list and then add them as the recipient when encrypting (in gpg4win this tells it who to encrypt the message for).<br /><br />You don&#039;t send any keys.&nbsp; Like said before, you can just cut and paste your public key to them as part of the message (encrypted or unencrypted doesn&#039;t matter - although sending it encrypted is a bit more secure for various reasons).

				1. Open GPG KeyChain App (Applications -&gt; GPG Keychain Access) and import the recipient&#039;s public key<br /><br />2. Open a Terminal and do the following: <br />gpg --encrypt --recipient &#039;recipient@domain&#039; --armour<br />(Answer Y if gpg asks you whether you want to use the key above, make sure it matches the recipient)<br /><br />3. Type your message into the window then press Ctrl-D to let the terminal know you have finished typing.<br /><br />The PGP message should output to the terminal, use CMD-C and CMD-V to copy pasta<br /><br />4. Delete text file containing the recipient&#039;s public key and delete their key from your GPG Keychain.<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />
