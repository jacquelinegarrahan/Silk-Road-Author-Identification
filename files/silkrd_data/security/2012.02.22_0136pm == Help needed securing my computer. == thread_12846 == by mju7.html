				What OS? Mac, Windows, Linux?<br />I think most would agree that Linux is the most secure... but you may not find that your favorite based on ease-of-use. Whether you use a live cd/usb or your HD for your more nefarious activities, I would definitely go ahead and do FDE (full disk encryption) on your whole comp anyway. Windows and Linux has built in programs for this, and surprisingly Windows has actually rated very well on this utility.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live!

				I heard that running an operating system from a USB could damage it after prolonged use due to the constant reading and writing but I&#039;m not entirely sure about that. For the instructions, install TrueCrypt, click &quot;system&quot; at the top, and click &quot;create hidden operating system&quot;. Follow the instructions, they are relatively straightforward. If you have trouble with anything or need clarification on something specifically post here.

				Its about your practices too, if you have a hidden install of a seperate OS for doing dodgy stuff make sure that you use the other install frequently as well otherwise it might raise eyebrows if your computer is seized.

				You might not have known this but Truecrypt comes with Tails.&nbsp; When booting from a USB drive (assuming you&#039;ve installed Tails on a USB drive) wait for the language selection to come up.&nbsp; Mine always defaults to the &quot;English&quot; selection.&nbsp; Then hit the &quot;Tab&quot; key and the menu will change to what looks like a text-based command line.&nbsp; Then hit the spacebar and type &quot;truecrypt.&quot;&nbsp; Then hit &quot;Enter.&quot;<br /><br />When your PC finishes booting look under the Applications -&gt; Accessories menu.&nbsp; There at the bottom you&#039;ll see Truecrypt.&nbsp; <br /><br />To create a USB drive with Tails all you need is the Tails .iso image and software to create a bootable USB drive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used something called Universal USB Installer (it runs on Windows) to create a bootable USB drive with Tails.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve booted with Tails you can go to System -&gt; Administration -&gt; GParted to create another partition on your USB drive.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one thing I really like about running Tails or Liberte Linux from a USB drive is that both will start to shutdown if the USB drive is removed.&nbsp; So if you suddenly find yourself needing to shut down your Silk Road connection ASAP just yank out the USB drive and the shutdown process starts immediately.&nbsp; Within about 10 seconds all processes will be stopped and the memory wiped.

				Tails is super fail because of its lack of persistent Tor guard nodes. Liberte is much more secure for this reason provided you use the live USB flavor and disable the cables system it has.

				I am sure that this is basic and there is better advice above, but I have a drive installed that is XFS format which Windows cannot read without third party apps.&nbsp; It is also a dual boot for Ubuntu, which can only be accessed through BIOS changes.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that the fuzz would be too dumb to even realize this was part of my pc and they would just boot to windows first which doesn&#039;t and can&#039;t see the other drive.<br />I reckon if my computer was seized for small time stuff they wouldn&#039;t even find my hidden stash inside it (hidden there so the girlfriend never finds it).<br /><br />I also store any keys and stuff on my NAS, which is hidden in my house, so doubt they would even think to collect that.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Oh...and thinking of building a self-destruct option if they press the wrong keys.<br /><br />Seriously though, I think that police resources that are that trained in security forensics etc are very expensive and only interested in serious criminals - especially terrorism.<br /><br />

				I know on the Dells you can set 3 passwords. Other words you have 3 levels of security. You have a BIOS password, Administrator Password and a Hard drive password. If you have set all the passwords set. This done in the bios. If you have the HD password set. It is impossible to access any information on the hard drive. Even if you try using it in another computer. If you forget your password your screwed. You have to buy another hard drive. Some other computers have these options too. You have to check B4 your buy.( I&#039;m former Dell Tech )
