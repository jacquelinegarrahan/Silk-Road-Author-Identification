				Okay so I am expecting the FBI to be at house today to talk to me about something, because for the past two days these two men in suits have came to my house but I was sleeping both times&nbsp; :P Anyways I recently ordered 50 grams of 4-mec off of the internet and it is currently on its way to my friends place. If it really is the FBI which I am damn sure it probably is after everything I&#039;ve read today, what should I say if they ask me what I am going to do with 50 grams of 4-mec? I dont think saying &quot;oh, its for personal use&quot; is a good idea. Should I say I&#039;m going to use it to fragrant my bath water?&nbsp; ;D or should I just say &quot;I don&#039;t feel comfortable answering your questions without a lawyer present&quot;?

				Don&#039;t listen to anything else posted here other than this:<br /><br />SAY NOTHING. NOT A SINGLE WORD. DON&#039;T EVEN OPEN THE DOOR. <br /><br />If they really want to talk to you, they&#039;ll break the door down. (make sure your house/computer is clean) In which case, only say &quot;I want a lawyer&quot;.. and NOTHING ELSE until your lawyer gets there.<br /><br />That&#039;s all you need to know.

				LOL that is a gross misconception my friend and you are getting cocky for no good reason. The analogue laws in the U.S mean that they can prosecute you as-and-when they can be arsed or have a decent reason to. Now I would be even more worried if I were you because the fact the FBI and not just some local LE is coming means they have probably twigged you got it from here OR from one of those zany RC forums that have just been shut down. I would not be surprised if they threw SR into the mix and tried to flip you. <br /><br />Also the fact you have identified what you got and how much was a bit of bad judgement too, anyone watching this can print screen and then run through their agency files and match you to this account now. <br /><br />I would strip your house clean NOW and change all posts NOW and hope to Christ no damage is done.

				You left out the part about you living at home with your parents<br /><br />I&#039;d follow Lims advice. And if you do have to talk to them, for christ sake don&#039;t make up any absurd cover story or any ridiculous nonsense out of fear. Ask for a lawyer and that&#039;s it

				im no LE but im pretty sure anytime any officer of any kind has ever come to any home I&#039;ve ever heard of, or place of business for that matter, they either busted in the door and shot a flash-bang (like someone already mentioned) or they leave a card and tell whoever there or if no one is there they are sure to leave a card saying CALL me. I wouldn&#039;t worry if I was you, the feds really don&#039;t have time to be fucking with RC&#039;s especially not 50g and they certainly aren&#039;t gonna make 2 house calls without talking to anyone or without leaving something so that you can contact them(so they can stop making house-calls) I would assume its a lot of other people before I assumed it was any form of Fed, unless of course there&#039;s something your leaving out... good luck

				Kind of hard to prove 4-MEC was for human consumption when its not even in your possession. <br /><br />Just ignore it, and don&#039;t even qualify it. Its an RC, they aren&#039;t going to go after some super small time buyer. 50g of 4-MEC is such a hilariously small order.

				Honestly, it could be just two assholes trying to sell me some shit&nbsp; &gt;:( I would be so pissed if thats what it was. Because I have been reading on the internet and from what I&#039;ve read feds always travel in packs of 2 people or more and they always wear suits if they want to talk to you. But like you said, they have no reason to be wasting their time over 50 g&#039;s of 4-MEC&nbsp; :D It does make sense that they would leave some kind of note saying CALL ME or something along those lines. They don&#039;t or at least &#039;shouldn&#039;t&#039; have the time to be coming over to my house hoping that I&#039;m going to be awake or home.

Unless you live in a state like Florida where it is banned you have nothing to worry about unless you literally have a massive bag of Capped up or pressed 4-MEC. The FBI wouldn&#039;t waste their time on that, ever.

				That&#039;s what I was thinking. I literally have nothing illegal in my house whatsoever at the moment that has to do with any type of drugs or RC&#039;s&nbsp; 8) And if I was doing something that I didn&#039;t mention I don&#039;t think the police or feds or who the fuck ever would come to my house and ask me if I&#039;m doing it haha they would definitely try and catch me in the act and then bust me and try to fuck me. But I don&#039;t have anything to hide, I just think it&#039;s weird.

				Woot was a complete dumbass. That is why he got caught. They hit him with analogues because he talked about consumption on skype with a confidential informant and imported a good amount of rcs explicably for retail on the goddamn board he was running! That was the dumbest goddamn move of all. <br /><br />If woot wasn&#039;t so cracked out on the rcs he bought with all the money he rakedin from vendors then he may have been fine. He had a Scarface vision with a kindergarten mentality. I miss EK, but good ridance of woot. He rolled as soon as he was booked which is why the ownership was transfered to RESU. <br /><br />If he didn&#039;t get caught then he would have eventually gotten aught through his carelesz security measures. Fucking druggie kids trying to play this head hauncho game is the reason why shit hit the fan so badly when it did. <br /><br />Just remember, if you&#039;re ordering any drug(even legal) you can be prosecuted if they want you bad enough. Federal agencies don&#039;t fuck around! And if they pursue you they WILL get you.
