				I got this from customer service after i got an &quot;unable to process your transaction&quot; error......<br /><br /><br />Weâ€™ve recently launched improved security measures related to our Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer processes. We have temporarily limited transactions in some locations, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your home state is one of these locations. <br /><br />Read more here: http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2013/6/30/website-update.html<br /><br />We do not have an exact timeframe for reactivation of locations, but we will make an announcement via our website, blog, Facebook page and Twitter account as we enable new locations. We will also send you a notification email when we begin to process transactions for your state. <br /><br />Again, we apologize for the inconvenience and will let you know as soon as something changes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />so it looks as if bitinstant is OUT for me unless I can use a friends addy who is in a state they DO recognize.<br /><br /><br />I am going to try localbitcoins tomorrow...with a local deposit<br />

				Just checked this out...oh wow. Glad I got in a deposit when I did before they force you to sign up.<br />I just loooveee how they actually tell you they&#039;re basically running a quick background check on you. Which is just so awesome.<br />Sigh. I shall be continuing to look for an alternative (aside from localbitcoins and BST-which seem to be the only alternatives out there...scary)<br />If anyone has any ideas for the US, feel free to post or PM me.<br />Hopefully something will work out for you soon, OP!!

				I&#039;m pretty sure BST wont have any Bitcoins for a few days as I was told that. Bitinstant is a piece of shit service imo. Now I&#039;m stuck using Localbitcoins but I&#039;m not complaining someone in my neighborhood is selling some&nbsp; 8).

				My work around with bitinstant was to use my mom&#039;s contact info...she is in a state that they DO allow transactions....yet I was able to deposit from my state that doesnt...weird...still, I am most comfortable with their &quot;shitty service&quot; as I can go into local walmart, no questions asked. <br /><br />My issue with&nbsp; blue sky is that its down till AT LEAST tomorrow. I have used them before. It worked well. I just have no patience.&nbsp; I want my gear when I want it.<br /><br />I checked out localbitcoin...kinda confusing...read EVERYTHING...but they had a 90 min window and I couldnt make the bank before it closed. It still a viable option tho.<br /><br />will update you on bitinstant success&nbsp; (think positive)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I created a &quot;dummy&quot; account using my out-of-state sister&#039;s info, and when I entered all the transaction information (wallet address, amount, etc) I couldn&#039;t get to the page where it tells what to put down on the MoneyGram slip.<br /><br />It just goes to a page on ZipZap&#039;s site that says something about an &quot;Identity Error&quot; or something (at this point I&#039;m not even on BitInstant&#039;s site anymore)<br /><br />And then the transaction is still listed on my BitInstant profile as &quot;Pending&quot;

				i got it to work....to a point<br /><br />my payment made it thru walmart to paypal and thru paypal to bitinstant....there the order says pending....for 2.5 hours. <br /><br />I emailed bit instant. now we wait.<br /><br />I figure once the payment goes THRU zipzap...which is Sand Fran based...bitinstant cant see where its coming from....it should ALL look like it comes from San Fran..right?<br /><br />

				Again, not even sure how you got to the ZipZap page with the MoneyGram information on it<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking they must&#039;ve closed this loophole right after you placed the order or something, since I just tried again and it did the exact same thing ;_;

				Haven&#039;t used the &#039;new&#039; bitinstant.&nbsp; Localbitcoins is the easiest way I&#039;ve found of getting coinage.&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust bitinstant with the level of info they want from people buying BTC.
