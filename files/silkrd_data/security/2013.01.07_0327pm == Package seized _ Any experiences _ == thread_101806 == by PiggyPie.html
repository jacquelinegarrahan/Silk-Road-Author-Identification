				Title: <strong>Package seized ? Any experiences ?</strong><br />

				Recently a bulk package of cannabis was ordered to the UK from North America, it had tracking on it and after arriving in the UK the tracking merely stopped. The package still shows as having arrived in the UK at what is the customs facility. It has been there for more than 3 weeks and nothing has been heard. No contact from the police or customs, just silence. Legitimate packages have continued to arrive (some from overseas) none showing any signs of being opened. <br /><br />Does anyone have any experience of having a bulk package seized in the UK ? It seems the most likely answer that this is what has happened to this package, it just seems strange that no action has of yet been taken.

				If your talking about &quot;bulk&quot;&nbsp; i guess you will know sooner or later if its seized or just waiting to be checked , controlled delivery etc...<br /><br />if its small amount it will probably just &quot;disappear&quot; at some point,&nbsp; but bulk - either arrives with police or police arrives without it once seized.

				I once had a couple litres of GBL stay at customs for over a week.. The package never showed up and I got a love letter saying it had been seized. If your product is a little harder / larger quantity, I would be concerned with the length of time it has taken to clear.. <br />Probably best to take some precautions in case it has been found and they attempt a controlled delivery / search.<br /><br />Best of luck, and I hope it is just clogged up in the system

				I envy you guys that you have this term &quot;love letters&quot;&nbsp; in your countries,<br /><br />in my country - a seized package mean a lovely visit from the police - even for the smallest amount or seeds of weed or just suspected package with white sugar might be enough for a warrant -&nbsp; but punishment will be easy to non existent for small amounts (assuming it does not happen too many times), just its annoying to go trough....

				I don&#039;t think their is any hope for the package arriving, I am just surprised that the recipient has heard nothing from any authorities, it has been very nearly a month since it arrived in the UK. <br />I am informed that precautions at the packages intended destination have been taken, I just wonder how long until the person can feel safe enough to allow contraband into the house. The fact other overseas packages arrived apparently unopened also seemed strange to me.<br />

				They are very strange, and they come from the customs authorities, rather than LE. <br />I guess it may have been different if it was for a more well known substance, as the GBL had only recently been changed to illegal for individuals to buy. GBL can still be imported by companies who have a licence to use in industry.<br />If it was more clean cut, like 2kg of MD then a knock at the door would be more probable! <br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard of anyone receiving such a letter even for a small amount of clearly illegal drugs, I bet they choose to stay quiet to make you paranoid as hell about what may happen..<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101806.msg709279#msg709279">Quote from: PiggyPie on January 07, 2013, 03:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t think their is any hope for the package arriving, I am just surprised that the recipient has heard nothing from any authorities, it has been very nearly a month since it arrived in the UK. <br />I am informed that precautions at the packages intended destination have been taken, I just wonder how long until the person can feel safe enough to allow contraband into the house.

Also, I believe that for all future orders to be stopped and search without reasonable cause for each item, that a court order would be needed..

				I shall advise the buyer to maintain a clean house for another month I think then. The purchase was from a reputable vendor so there is no reason to doubt them, but if the package had an undeliverable address and return address, could this not cause the package to be halted and &#039;lost&#039; in the way it was ? I admit this is unlikely, but I am just trying to consider all the possibilities.

				This is why I stick to domestic purchases/shipping. Granted, I&#039;m in the U.S. and only buy weed so I have lots of choices of vendors and products but still...

				If you&#039;ve received bulk amount of cannabis to the UK internationally, its not surprising that it has potentially been stopped... I may be able to send what you need domestically, PM if interested

				I don&#039;t mean as a place to have drugs delivered, I mean as a place for drugs to be, as in when it would be safe to stuff bought from street contacts back to the house

				I would suggest trying a few things to see what is happening with the package / address,<br />- wait to see if the package comes in the next 2 weeks<br />- send a few parcels to the delivery address, make them fit the same profile as your ones filled with drugs, but obviously just have them empty<br />- pay attention to details of the delivery times and tracking information, to see if anything seems off<br /><br />If all of those come clean over the next couple of weeks, then personally I would consider using the address again
