				I came across the virwex.com website. Apparently they are able to sell bitcoins cheaply because the buy them at auctions. Anyways I bought the 50 pack for 255.75 Its been 2 and a half hours and I still havent recieved any bitcoins in my bitcoin address I gave them. They do not have my sr name. I did pay via paypal so I am going to check back in morning,if they still havent got here I am going to open a case with paypal. Has anyone used virwex.com before?

				I felt kinda sorry that you got scammed, but luckily you used paypal, so you will most likely get your moneyback. But seriously dont trust those websites, like CaptainMal said, there are a few sr vendors that sell bitcoins, just stick with them.

				The way I understand it, you can&#039;t get PayPal refunds for services, or non-physical goods. That&#039;s EXACTLY why scammers use it.<br /><br />Sorry, you&#039;re not going to get your money back.<br /><br />

				besides the fact that you fell for the scam that is all over the forums, including PMs, (I got 2 today), i can understand falling for it being a first time user. <br /><br />but on a second note, and im no expert, but isnt it against our, um, anonymity rules so to speak to purchase btc through a website like paypal? seeing has how you use credit/debit cards linked to your account.

				If you&#039;re in the USA. I recommend Bitcopia.com. Extremely simple and quick to use if you can go to a Wells Fargo Bank branch. You just create the order on Bitcopia&#039;s site and then you have one hour to make the cash deposit at the bank (the time limit is there because the exchange rate for Bitcoins can change significantly during an hour). It&#039;s completely anonymous and you can receive your coins at any Bitcoin address (including free anonymous temporary wallets like Instawallet.org). Then, if you desire, you can tumble your coins (at somewhere like Bitcoin Fog, for example) for extra security before you transfer them to SR. I like to even go through more temporary wallets between Bitcon Fog and SR. The more times you move the coins and the more different amounts and different Bitcoin addresses you use for the transfers, the harder it will ever be for anyone to trace the movement paths of the coins. It might sound complicated if you&#039;re new to it but once you&#039;ve done it a couple of times, it will seem like child&#039;s play.<br /><br />My advice for other newbies is to be overly cautious at first until you get the hang of it. Then you can decide if you&#039;re safe to cut out any of the steps because you think they&#039;re overkill. There&#039;s nothing wrong with being too careful if it makes you feel safe and eases your fears. The worst thing about it might be the few small service charges you could pay when buying or tumbling your coins. Plus you do have to wait for confirmations of the transfers so it can take some extra time for the extra steps.<br /><br />I&#039;ve pretty much given up using Mt. Gox and Bitinstant because these other methods are easier and more anonymous since they can be used with TOR and I&#039;m never asked for a name or birthday. I have nothing against any Bitcoin vendors on SR or in these forums, but I personally prefer to buy my Bitcoins from a vendor who has no direct connection to SR.<br /><br />I hope this advice helps. This community has been extremely helpful to me. I&#039;m just trying to share what I&#039;ve learned.
