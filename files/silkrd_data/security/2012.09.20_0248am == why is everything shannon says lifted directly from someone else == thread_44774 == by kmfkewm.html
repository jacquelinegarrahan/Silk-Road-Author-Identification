				Here is one of a large pool of examples<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it&#039;s actually not a terrible idea<br /><br />i know somebody who suspected an interception and called up the usps from a burner to inquire about their package, they helpfully disclosed that a package containing an unknown white powder was seized, then that person simply never went to pick it up</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hm this sounds suspiciously like my story regarding a vendor who had a package show up as seized on tracking and who then called customs from a burner phone to inquire about their package. I have seen Shannon shamelessly plagiarize me as well as others several times. Probably even more if I paid attention. I just wonder why on earth would Shannon want to make it seem like other peoples quotes are her own? Does she think that we don&#039;t have the ability to remember posts from the past? Or that she can delete the post before the person she has plagiarized notices? She acts like she is from private scene and gives plenty of quotes making it appear that way, except nobody knows who the fuck she is and all of her quotes are lifted from others. For that matter does she have a massive database of quotes from SR SOS and other public places which she posts as she sees to be appropriate?<br /><br />At first I just ignored it. Whatever quote my shit and others shit and pretend you wrote it. But now I am just wondering why the fuck would a person do this? It seems weird.

				It is not just the experience but the very wording. In some cases it looks as if you have directly copy pasted something and only changed one or two words around. Plenty of people here have shared past experiences and contacts with me, but nobody else here has shared past posts with me.

				let&#039;s see here:<br /><br />my post almost five months ago: <br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What about all of the vendors who used fake ID boxes and didn&#039;t get busted because of it? One vendor who had 5 grams of crystal LSD seized and didn&#039;t go in to pick it up because the tracking said &quot;Held by non-customs federal agency&quot; comes to mind. He called from a burner phone from a random location to inquire about the status of his package, and they kindly informed him that they wanted to question him about a baggie of material that was discovered in his package. Another also comes to mind where hundreds of sheets to multiple people resulted in raids, and since everyone else who participated in that order got raided he decided not to go to his box to pick up his package. What about all the people who drop their boxes after they find out one of the people who they get shit from was arrested, making it so they don&#039;t give a fuck if the person gives shipping info to the feds. What about the fact that its harder for LE to put a bunch of fake ID box locations under constant manned surveillance than it is for them to log all of the addresses on outgoing mail from a vendor they put under surveillance. What about the fact that there is technically nothing stopping you from having vendors use broadcasting interception detection technology to alert you if your package has been opened in transit. What about the fact that they sign for the package for you ? What about the fact that if some asshole you order from decides to blackmail you with your address or spam your address, you can just drop the box and get another one? What about etc etc etc. Fake ID private mail boxes are the clear winner, but try to use in state ID if you can. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />your post today:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it&#039;s actually not a terrible idea<br /><br />i know somebody who suspected an interception and called up the usps from a burner to inquire about their package, they helpfully disclosed that a package containing an unknown white powder was seized, then that person simply never went to pick it up<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />This is not the most blatant example of plagiarism I have seen you engage in, but although I have been noticing it for quite some time I have not been keeping records. My favorite was when you copied a post off SOS talking about how admin of OVDB ran multiple forums in the past and closed them down only a few months later, that one was pretty much a word for word copy of someone I actually know and talk with (someone who you are not).

				by the way did you tap into our private ECDH encrypted IRC conversation when we in real time discussed the customs seizure letter he got + I gave him the advice of calling from a burner phone? I can&#039;t imagine where else you heard about it, considering I was on every forum he was, and hm let me think I know every single person involved with that deal who knows about what happened and I have no fucking clue who you are !! Why would he talk with some random person about importing so much LSD?

				Okay I can confirm that Shannon knows a long list of private scene forums of the past, still would be nice to know who she claims she was on these forums (especially as all of the names of those forums have been leaked at one point or another). If I actually know who you are why not just tell me the nym you used. I just find it strange to see you write things that are so similar to things other people have written. At first I was just going to ignore it because really I don&#039;t care, but after so many times I really just would love to get to the bottom of why this is happening.

				Assuming these are actually two separate people, it&#039;s possible that shannon is just using k as a source without mentioning it. Shit, I do the same thing from time to time when I post info and can&#039;t remember the source, although I&#039;ll always put a &quot;I read somewhere that...&quot; or if I&#039;m really lazy &quot;as someone in this thread/forum already mentioned...&quot; so y&#039;all don&#039;t get it twisted.

				Shannon is Jonah Lehrer! Oh internet! Ok, I&#039;ll be serious now... :)<br /><br />I have a question for Shannon I might as well bring up here, which is why do you delete your posts when we know several LEAs are recording every single post and edit to posts made on this forum. It just seems a bit pointless. I&#039;m not saying you shouldn&#039;t do what you want to, but I don&#039;t understand it because I&#039;m sure you know LEA is page scrapping the entire forum back to front as well as I do. What is the rationale?<br /><br />--<br /><br />On the subject: I don&#039;t think Shannon is QTC, I seem to remember QTC&#039;s posts were usually a bit longer than Shannon&#039;s posts, and unless Shannon is also trying to avoid a writeprint, then their style of writing is considerably different, even though they occasionally used similar domain specific words. But everybody involved in security and shipping uses similar language since any division of labor will have its own nomenclature , so that probably means nothing at all. Domain language is a universal irrespective of language or origin, look at doctors and lawyers, they&#039;re famous for it. Geeks unite across all boundaries!&nbsp; &lt;3 <br /><br />To be honest, in reference to the plagiarism issue it is fairly hard for us to independently work out if what you&#039;re saying is true kmfkewm without trawling through hundreds of posts until we find a pattern. It it possible that you&#039;ve spotted a clear irregularity, or it could be a combination of coincidence and loose attributions. For instance, I&#039;m sure if you trawled through all my posts you&#039;d eventually find me saying something or other with a first person perspective that could directly be attributed to somebody else&#039;s thoughts, but which I didn&#039;t refer to the origin of.<br /><br />In short: I have no idea and even if we cross matched Shannon and kmfkewm&#039;s posts, it proves little because it is the semantic meaning which you&#039;re looking to see similarities with mostly, which is a job for a human not a machine and a heck of a lot of work. In any case as a general rule, so long as plagiarism is not intended for malicious reasons e.g. impersonation, but as a way of sharing useful information and such, I don&#039;t really mind it. I know lots of good threads from a few months ago I wouldn&#039;t mind people plagiarizing so the information gets out there and discussed e.g. geographical profiling tech and so on.<br /><br />P.S. what the fuck is SR SOS? I can&#039;t believe there&#039;s an acroymn on SR I haven&#039;t heard of :D<br /><br />&nbsp;

Paranoia is our occupational hazard. It should be the case for everybody too!&nbsp; I would much prefer kmfkewm (or me, or you) come out and say he sees something unusual than for everybody to just lie back and keep silent out of some civilian social convention that doesn&#039;t apply on here.<br /><br />It is easy to malign people for making a mistake (albeit I wouldn&#039;t classify this thread as a mistake at all, more like an observation than an accusation), but it should be realized that if we were not ever vigilant, we&#039;d be on Topix and not SR, and people who use PGP would be laughed off as helplessly paranoid characters. The fact of the matter is that a great deal of people you may think were using PGP, were not using PGP, and I only know this because they have sent me PMs. I am happy about this, but more people need to come forward, out of the encryption closet as it were, and get this shit tap down. Pine respects people who are humble enough to admit they don&#039;t know something, and will help you understand PGP if you only try to join the Club.<br /><br />If you read enough intelligence documents, you will think this way too. If you go to prison, or your friends are kidnapped by the state for years, decades, then you&#039;ll think this way, but you don&#039;t need to have that happen to you.<br /><br />We don&#039;t need to make other people&#039;s mistakes in order to learn lessons from them. Look at the Farmer&#039;s Market. Look at the OVDB related busts. Look at what happened to Strike. In almost every single case, more vigilance and better operation security would have rescued them from being stuck behind bars. If LE makes a bust, 99/100 it is because of poor decision making by their target, and almost never through luck.<br /><br />There is of course a danger is searching for patterns, but if you use the tools of logic appropriately, like Occam&#039;s Razor and so forth, then you will be right most of the time. That&#039;s all vigilance requires, we don&#039;t require perfection on SR, only attention to detail and a good effort put in to learn stuff.<br /><br />If this was a physical space in the world, I would put up posters saying things like &quot;Keep Watchful&quot;, similar to the &quot;Loose lips sink subs&quot; style of thing, but we don&#039;t have posters to put up, so we must all simply repeat sound advice over and over and over until it is commonsensical and obvious to every noob and nooblet. That is the ultimate buffer to the evils of Topix.<br /><br />I know there is a whole lot of lurkers on this forum, more so than most. But lurkers, you too have a responsibility to the upkeep of SR&#039;s security. If you know better, then you help your fellow man, or you become guilty of exclusively looking out for yourself. You did learn your trade somewhere and made mistakes too, you have an obligation to pass on the baton too.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think it doesn&#039;t mean anything to post here. It does. One single insightful realization or piece of intelligence can make a huge difference if articulated correctly. There is tonnes of black market lore that is not on this forum, both theoretical and practical knowledge, and it is inside the heads of these lurkers. The statistics say that there are ten times as many people just reading a forum in comparison to the number posting on it, so there is a vast repository of knowledge there which is currently completely untapped. You can lurk most of the time, but don&#039;t lurk without responsibility, give something back.
