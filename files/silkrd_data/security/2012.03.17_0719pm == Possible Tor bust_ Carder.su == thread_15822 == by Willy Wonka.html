				Hopefully the technical people can find out what happened here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Carder.su<br /><br />Leaders of the organization allegedly tested and provided reviews of services including money laundering, and products like fake identification documents and stolen credit card account data lists from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the U.S.<br /><br />Site users tried to protect their anonymity and prevent detection, but ICE Homeland Security Investigations official James Dinkins said the case showed that cyberspace was &quot;not a refuge from justice.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t see any indication carder.su was a hidden service? Or that those people used TOR?

				Best I could find thus far --<br /><br />hxxp://garwarner.blogspot.com/2012/03/operation-open-market-jonathan.html<br />Has more detail and some discussion. <br />I see no reference to Tor or Tor-like concepts in the write-up or the indictment. Unless there was another level to the site, with the identified site being a front?<br />I would excerpt more of this, but there are enough names, links, etc., that it seems weird and inappropriate, even though I realize it&#039;s on the damn internet already, yeah-I-get-that-thanks.<br />brief excerpt - <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">While we wait for the names of other &quot;Open Market&quot; criminals to be released, I thought it might be interesting to look at one of those named so far who has plenty of familiarity with Identity Theft, Carding, and the Legal System, Jonathan Vergnetti. Often in the case of these type of law enforcement &quot;Operations&quot; the operation combines recent arrests that clearly are related. In the case we&#039;ll examine today, the arrest actually occurred in June of 2010, but the new information is that the previously undisclosed &quot;internet&quot; source of Vergnetti&#039;s credit card information is now known to be the Carder.su website.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also includes a link to the original indictment -<br />hxxp://www.cis.uab.edu/forensics/blog/Vergnetti.Original.Indictment.pdf<br />and there is a case number on there, if someone has the urge to hunt up more documents on PACER but feels too lazy to look up by defendant... the time consuming part is connecting through -all- the cases.<br />Tor might be mentioned in one of the complaints, if that&#039;s on PACER. The complaints themselves usually seem to show up within a few days on the news sites or blogs.<br /><br />Not much else out there yet beyond the frequently &quot;repurposed&quot; press release / feed story.&nbsp; [Does anyone not write anything independently? Back in the day, journalists had to ski up hill both ways - which was difficult with the cigarettes in their mouths and the whiskey in their hands - to interview two original sources before they could write a hard lead.]<br />--f.
