				was it bad to use MTGOX from my actual ip? since they had that whole thing going with the stolen passwords and whatnot and ip&#039;s being blocked from tor. Was it dumb of me to sign in using my actual ip? you think maybe it was LE found them and they are set up in MTGOX place to see who buys bitcoins etc? or am i just being paranoid?<br /><br />and then to make matters worse i sent directly to SR, then realized what i did sent it to mybitcoin set up 6 different accounts split the coins sent to one another then sent it back to another SR account. anyone see if am in jeopardy?

				Silk Road is pretty safe if theory. You broke one of the safety rules but you should be ok. It would be very difficult for LE to know that the address you sent to is Silk Road because of his tumbler. <br /><br />The bitcoin you took out should not be the same ones you put in<br /><br />LE does not control MtGox. MtGox is doing the IP thing because of the break in, and abuse like they claim. Most bitcoin traffic is totally legit. You should consider your real IP to be personal information and not use it with MtGox/Silk Road to increase your security. <br /><br />Posting here might link a username to a specific patten of trading you described.&nbsp; You should edit your post.

				How do you transfer money to your MTGOX account?<br /><br />Personally I go Bank-MTGOX-SR <br /><br />And I ALWAYS login to my MTGOX account from my home IP, why? because i send money to that account from MY&nbsp; BANK ACCOUNT, far better proof than an IP address.<br /><br />If they can trace bitcoins from MTGOX-SR then they sure as hell can trace whatever bounce around you use.<br />

				cant say i know much more what im doing than the rest of you, but ive been putting funds into dwolla account before sending off to the btc exchange, rather than using dwolla&#039;s direct from bank option. that way its just another step towards anonymity. dunno how much good it does but it doesnt take any more time than the alternative, as i have tried it both ways now... ~smod
