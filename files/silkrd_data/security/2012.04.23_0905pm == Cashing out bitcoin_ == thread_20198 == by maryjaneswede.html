				Hello everyone, I just found this forum!&nbsp; Nice place! :)<br />I&#039;m thinking of starting to sell here or some other place, bitcoin seems to be a good way to get paid for the goods, <br />but I wonder what&#039;s the easiest way of cashing out large amounts of bitcoins is.<br />Because I of course want to get some real fiat currency out from it!<br />I&#039;m really looking, and found some sites that seem to do the job, but thought of asking here first.<br />Is there any prepaid debit cards that I can order that I can load with bitcoin? <br />I found some sites, but how do I know if they are genuine?<br />The second option would be to sell bitcoins and get paid to my bank account.<br />Preferably some official site, not on exchange sites where unknown people are dealing with each other..<br /><br />Since you are all dealing with bitcoin on a daily basis I thought that this would be a good place to ask!<br />I&#039;m sure there must be some good way of cashing out large amounts of bitcoins..

If you examine the SR &quot;Money&quot; section you will also see other sellers offering dollars in the mail and even bank transfers, although if you&#039;re going to do that you might as well use a service like Intersango to receive your funds.<br /><br />For very large amounts of money in the first instance I&#039;d suggest you speak to Lim - I also offer investment plans for people with larger amounts of BTC to allow them to grow their savings a little by investing them in legitimate business ventures. Feel free to message me for more details. If you want to redeem a large amount of BTC very fast though I would suggest you use the Coinabul site which exchanges BTC for precious metals - a gold bar can be on its way to you in the post in no time. :-)<br /><br />Any other questions, please feel free to ask.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				is BTC &quot;tagged&quot; ? so they would be trackable all the way from buyer -vendor -&gt; services like Intersango -&gt; bank account ?<br />and also when moving small amounts to bank account, 1000-4000$/year do you even need to laundry the money? can you claim it was from sold e-auction listings?

Think of every BTC Address as a PGP Public Key which is used to encrypt a certain Bitcoin. Only the person with the corresponding Private Key can then decrypt the Bitcoin and claim it as their own. This is the basis on which all wallet software works, be it online, on paper or on a computer program.<br /><br />In the nature of things coins will then have to be decrypted and sent from the same address to which they were sent, just as you couldn&#039;t take a message I&#039;d sent you encrypted with your own public key and then send it on to someone else without you decrypting it first. <br /><br />In light of this the passage of BTC throughout the Bitcoin block chain can always be tracked if you know the address from which they were sent unless they are put through a Bitcoin mixing service which &quot;launders&quot; them (more on that later).<br /><br />As such if it is possible to link a Bitcoin address to someone&#039;s identity, and they then sent coins to another Bitcoin address, it would be very easy to see where they had sent the coins. Since the coins would then have to be sent from the new address, once again it would be easy to trace this transaction and so on.<br /><br />SR Vendors however do have a built in &quot;mixer&quot; in their online wallet which swaps their coins for others, making it very difficult to prove a direct line of transactions between them and someone who has bought their product. They are also careful not to &quot;cash out&quot; in a way that can easily be traced.<br /><br />As such for small amounts I would say that using a mixing service like Bitcoinfog isn&#039;t strictly necessary but since their commission is only 1-3%, maybe you should consider it all the same.<br /><br />V.

				Hey there. Obviously there are some bitcoin &quot;exchanges&quot; of sorts on Silkroad, but you are taking a risk by doing any kind of business with them, as you are not truly protected. From experience, I recommend MtGox. As I&#039;m sure you know, it has the highest volume, and I&#039;ve always had quick and easy transactions with them! Plus, you can set the rate at which you&#039;d like to sell them, and when the market reaches that rate, you&#039;ll have USD in your account that you can send to a bank through Dwolla. If you need any help with setting up an account, don&#039;t hesitate to send me a PM!<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />~Meloni

				Yes I do know..I am a vendor myself. But still, there is some risk involved in it. Silkroad in itself does not really condone nor love bitcoin vendors. I don&#039;t mean to take away from the work you do, I am just trying to keep the OP as informed as possible.<br /><br />~Meloni

				if you can pay all your available bills in cash or debit you can at LEAST launder that amount per month for your own cost of living expenses including housing and electric if you convert them to moneypak then to your prepaid card of choice. Some even offer bill pay options to help you out. Paypal allows you to deposit 4k a month of moneypak. I&#039;ll leave it to you how to launder it all but those tools alone can carry most vendors pretty far. If you are into weight so high you can&#039;t get rid of it then you have a GREAT problem. Send it my way and I&#039;m sure I will find a way to use it ;)
