				Hey guys.<br /><br />Anyone have any insight or prior experience with this?<br />Need to exchange smaller bills, 20s, into 100s.<br />Any obvious place to do this would be at a bank, but- probably need to be a member, and maybe the first stack of fifty 20&#039;s into ten 100&#039;s wouldn&#039;t be an issue, but any more it seems would raise a red flag or at the least raise some unwanted suspicion.<br /><br />And then I was thinking maybe purchasing a $1000 money order, having myself or a friend deposit it and ask for 100&#039;s in return.<br />This seems better, as you&#039;re not bringing stacks of cash to get the money converted, simply a depositable check.<br /><br />Other obvious places are friends, but that route is usually limited in scope.<br /><br />Local businesses- perhaps, but would be a slow and tedious process, probably only one 100 at a time.<br /><br />Any tips?<br />I suppose WU/MG payments could be arranged, and if you&#039;re lucky they might have 100s to hand out, but that is hefty with fees.<br /><br />I can see this being easy on a small scale, but what are some good and anonymous ways if you&#039;re wanting to trade your money for bigger bills in the several thousand dollar range, all while keeping the attention and questions to a minimum?<br /><br />Thanks.

				If you&#039;re willing to pay a steep comission, you can convert your cash to bitcoins and purchase 100s from the money section of SR. I think your money order idea might work, but if you want to completely avoid suspicion of any sort, getting your bills via SR would be best. I don&#039;t have any experience with this, though, so I&#039;m just guessing here.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s what you do: Go into a bank, wearing jeans a t-shirt, but seem good looking, maybe a little grease stain.&nbsp; Then you politely ask the teller if they wouldn&#039;t mind exchanging some 20s for 100s, use less than 10k, make it 2-3k tops.&nbsp; So then you tell them that you need to buy a motorcycle/boat/car because this guy down the street from you is selling his, but he&#039;s going to sell it to his cousin at a discount if he can&#039;t get cash today, to pay his cable bill(do this on a day when there is a sports match on TV.)&nbsp; I did this for a drug syndicate for a while, and honestly, you should be a bit paranoid, but not too paranoid.&nbsp; As long as &lt;5k USD is changing hands, you should be good. After a while, they don&#039;t even bat an eye, you flirt with the girl behind the counter, nothing too far, just a smile will do.&nbsp; This one bank teller, I hit her up for like 5k in 2 weeks, I thought she was in love with me, I even contemplated asking her out, because she was pretty hot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, anyway, thats how it&#039;s done, you should go to multiple banks, and change your clothes.

				Thanks for the replies, good advice.<br />I was considering going that route- going into a bank for the exchange, saying I need the money to purchase a car from a private seller (if they ask).<br />Seems the most obvious as banks are financial institutions setup to do these types of things, but I am just slightly worried about anonymity especially if dealing with your own bank because then that money would probably be logged to you.<br /><br />GGGreenbud, ty for first hand knowledge: You didn&#039;t mention this, perhaps you can comment on it- you&#039;re saying multiple banks are the best, and I assume you mean any bank (affiliation/membership or not)?<br />Did they ever ask for identification, or deny your request due to you not being a member? <br />I&#039;m sure a good story is 90% of the battle, but what was the normal procedure on their side for conducting the transaction?<br /><br />This would be ideal if any bank would be willing to do an exchange like this, but I&#039;m uncertain. In my experience credit unions, the first thing they ask you is your account number, are banks more lenient, or does it all depend?<br /><br />Another interesting idea I&#039;ve came across was doing a cash exchange from a Casino teller- seems like it should work, but, again, haven&#039;t tried.

				Also, I&#039;m sure with the story and the interaction with the teller in a bank situation you would want to make it as easy and convienient for them too I would assume, and they in return would be more willing to help<br /><br />Any advice for hauling in fifty or a hundred twentys?<br />Being organized and not fumbling is I&#039;m sure an important strategy- A wallet obviously wouldn&#039;t work for the size, if I were female a purse might work well- perhaps just an envelope with X ammt to make it easier on them, perhaps bundled together in some way (want to say rubberband but that seems unprofessional).

				I&#039;ve done this before at a bank. I wasn&#039;t a member, no questions were really asked.<br />Sort it out and place it in an envelope and ask them if you can get 100s. Make a comment about buyer a newer car or a motorcycle or something and smile. If they seem hesitant with the amount, don&#039;t make it a big deal and be like &quot;ah, you know what, no big deal, could you do like x amount and don&#039;t worry about the whole xx amount?&quot; If you get a weird feeling, do a smaller amount.<br />Seem nice, non-sketchy, and clean cut.<br />Only do a couple grand at one bank, move onto the next. I would recommend going to a different city after 2 or 3 banks. I would assume banks would keep track of transactions like this in some form or other and it could be a huge red flag if you&#039;re doing more than 5-10k in one day. Most businesses won&#039;t do it because they are not allowed to open the safe while open (or at least it&#039;s typically against policy and they really don&#039;t like doing it since the risk of robbery goes up--in their mind)

				The question is why do you want to do this? I have thought about this in the past and it really just serves no purpose unless you are a drug king-pin who is running out of place to store all his cash-currency. <br /><br />I would NOT trade in your bills at the bank for $100&#039;s. You can easily do it without being ID&#039;d, but $100 bills can be traced far easier than a stack of 20&#039;s that you may have gotten from several 10-100 individuals. I would just not do it. It&#039;s just giving LE or whoever another potential way to track you down if they ever desire to.<br /><br />If you&#039;re having a problem with money storage, I would suggest going online and buying currency bands. You can get about 10,000 $1000 bands for $5 I think. Without them I would not be able to keep my money organized. Alternatively you can use rubber-bands... Eitherway, if you&#039;re money has any connection to drugs, I would strongly suggest resisting the urge to go out of your way to exchange to higher denomination bills.<br /><br />I used to do this when I was making a thousand dollars ever now and then, but when I started going through $20-30k in stacks of 20s every 2 months or so, trading up your bills is simply not a realistic or smart thing to be doing.

				Rubber bands and a storage locker.&nbsp; When the first one is full, rent another and start again! Good luck!

				Live near a casino?<br /><br />Go to the poker room, go to the buy in desk and get how ever many thousands you want to exchange. <br /><br />Play a round or 2 or just sit and watch then take the chips back up and&nbsp; cash out.<br /><br />Easiest way to change dollars.

				Go to a casino or pub etc (or several) feed your notes into the pokie/slot machines, play for as little or as long as you want then hit the collect button, take your &#039;&#039;winnings&quot; to the counter and get your crispy $100&#039;s

A casino will want to give you large notes since they are so balling they never run short of 20s. I know a bit about the gaming industry. I&#039;d do it at a casino over a bar with video machines on a network. more likely to get noticed by staff in a place with 2-25 machines. Casino has hundreds of machines quite frequently.<br /><br />But what do you need hundreds for? You expose your stash to possible unnecessary scrutiny for no real benefit. Cash is cash, anyone will accept any amount when they want money. I&#039;m sorry, but I doubt you&#039;re the Medellin cartel moving your cash around with forklifts and weighing it in dump trucks.

				Hundreds are much easier to transport . Think about 20k in 20&#039;s . Now think about 20k in 100&#039;s . Big difference in size and easier to travel with .<br />I think the casino option is your best bet (no pun intended).
