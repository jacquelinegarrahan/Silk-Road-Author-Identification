				Hey guys.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit of a noob here, so hopefully you can clear this up for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to this scene.<br /><br />Is it safe/possible to maintain anonymity when transferring money from a verified Dwolla account?<br /><br />My plan is Bank Account (once my bank account is verified) &gt; Dwolla &gt; CampBX (to purchase BTC) &gt; __________ (some kind of intermediary to maintain anonymity?) &gt; Silk Road<br /><br />Any way this can be traced back to me?&nbsp; What is the best intermediary to use?&nbsp; Should I use several?

				That&#039;s pretty much waht I did...just after I&#039;d get them, bounce them around one or twice thru instawalllet.org ... never had a problem.&nbsp; Only thing is, I got more and more in the cloud, and didn&#039;&#039;t want anything on Desktop, so never ever brought them &#039;home&#039; here...u know...don&#039;t have btc wallet or anything on &#039;puter ... just bounced&#039;em and used&#039;em or left then in instawallet until needed...<br /><br />But main thing is, as in all areas, is that nobody really knows on here...we all ask questions, hoping there is some authority who can give us reassurance that we are on right path, and I think all of us--sooner or later--realize that we kind of have to chart our own path here...that we are the first explorers in a risky area and kind of have to find our own way...<br /><br />I mean, I&#039;m pretty much *not* a paranoid, but I use Tails for most of my stuff, since Tails keeps my lazy ass honest, in the sense that it all disappears when I log out...that does mean I need to keep my passwords, addresses,&nbsp; and bookmarks somewhere real handy tho, but also in the cloud.&nbsp; So I&#039;d look into a dropbox like site where you can store your important stuff, or you can just about use LastPass for this, or keep it all in a file in SwissDisk or somewhere else you feel comfortable...<br /><br />But again, none of us knows how seriously we are being taken, or who they want to nail...it&#039;s all guesswork, and luck, I suppose...best wishes....
