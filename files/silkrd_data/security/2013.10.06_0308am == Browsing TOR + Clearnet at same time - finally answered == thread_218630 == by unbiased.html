				This was always debated - can you be on TOR/SR at the same time as the regular internet and be untraceable?&nbsp; Not only is it not safe, but enforcement folks actively check for this. It turns out that it&#039;s not safe to use TOR and the internet from the same ISP.<br /><br />The arrest articles on DPR describe how they tracked him by viewing the ISP records from the coffee shop he went to, and matched him accessing his normal email address from the same ISP as the SR admin console.<br /><br />Lesson learned.

In the complaint it says that the SR Admin console was coded to only accept the VPN IP. He didn&#039;t use TOR because he needed a static IP for access based on the way he set it up. That didn&#039;t change until late Spring/early Summer. They were able to correlate that IP with his Gmail logins.<br /><br />But it has nothing to do with TOR because those logins would have had DIFFERENT IP addresses, not the same, if he were using one TOR and one non-TOR browser That doesn&#039;t answer the question at all, not even indirectly.

When I say &quot;old-fashioned police work&quot; I mean that they found the server and worked backwards from there. That they can identify individual TOR users has been well known for as long as SR existed. And the NSA does use malware to exploit flaws in Firefox. Both the NSA and GCHQ are also known to operate exit nodes, although not enough to unmask everybody. But they can watch traffic patterns.<br /><br />If you think I buy that FBI &quot;we&#039;ll get you eventually because we&#039;re all-knowing and all-powerful,&quot; you&#039;re mistaken. With that said, it&#039;s easy to get people who are lazy and who believe they are infallible thanks to the TBB. <br /><br />What I said was, they used ISP and VPN records to show the association between Ulbricht and DPR using Gmail and the SR admin console log-ins.
