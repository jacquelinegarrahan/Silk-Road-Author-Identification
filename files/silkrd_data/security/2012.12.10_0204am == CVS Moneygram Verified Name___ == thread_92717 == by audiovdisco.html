				So I went into CVS today to send a moneygram to ZipZapCash. Had my form printed out with recieve number, account number, etc. I gave a fake name and address, and told them I didn&#039;t have a phone. She asked me several times what my name was to verify, and then said she was verifying on her computer to see if the name matched up to the order. She told me that the name did not match up and that I needed to call ZipZap to figure out what the name is that was used for my order. But there wasn&#039;t any name on the order! That&#039;s what I don&#039;t understand. Or was she just trying to check the address to match the name? <br />I want to give it a second try, but I&#039;m unsure what name to use.

				Not from personal experience yet, but from what I&#039;ve read here at the forums, there&#039;s a problem using bitinstant.com to deposit at mtGox.&nbsp; &nbsp;bitinstant tells zipzap that the account name is John Doe, and ZipZap won&#039;t do the transfer because the name doesn&#039;t match the one on your mtGox account.<br /><br />I just used bitinstant/moneygram/zipzap tonight to go to a bitcoin address without problems, but I would have rather sent it to mtGox and traded at a better rate.<br /><br />
