				Hi, thanks for reading, I&#039;m gonna try and keep this quick for you guys.<br />So basically I want to start buying (and once I harvest in october, selling too, but let&#039;s not get too far ahead of ourselves) on silk road. I downloaded bitcoin QT and managed to create 2 wallets on my desktop computer by moving the wallet.dat to a sub folder and then interchanging that file and the new wallet.dat that was created.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done quite a bit of reading into how bitcoins work and masking their path etc and decided on a plan that I thought would allow me to buy easily yet remain anon:<br />Just buy bitcoins from mt. gox normally with a verified account and send it to my first wallet, then send those bitcoins to my second wallet, then to the seller, and at some point - either between the first and second wallet, or after the second wallet - use a generic bit-washing service so the bitcoins aren&#039;t associated with me that are going to the drug seller.<br /><br /><br />I thought this would be enough because I plan on only ever buying under a half ounce of weed, a few LSD tabs or 50 or less ecstasy pills. But then I came across a few threads that talked about GPG and Liberte, and about how they had and OS then an encrypted virtual OS (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0) - is this level of precaution necessary?<br /><br />Also, if it makes a difference, my bitcoin wallets are set to use the SOCKS proxy within the bition QT programme.<br />Sorry for the noobieness, we all have to start somewhere!<br />

One has to do with unlinking bitcoins that you use on SR from your real identity. The other is about the security of your computer. There are different ways to secure your computer, you don&#039;t have to use Tails, but you should unlink your bitcoins anyway.<br />
