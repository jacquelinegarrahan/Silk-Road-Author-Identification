				So it&#039;s a week since Liberty Reserve got closed, and every single article I read then predicted that RL money looking for anonymity would flow into Bitcoin. It hasn&#039;t happened, in fact the price seems to have fallen a little. <br /><br />I thought this might be the start of another surge, and possibly an opportunity. Anybody got any thoughts as to why there hasn&#039;t been a knock-on effect?

				Less people are buying bitcoins because it is becoming harder with multiple exchanges closing. Less demand= Less Price per Bitcoin

				For future references, financial journalists, namely for the stock market, have no idea what they&#039;re talking about as it is completely impossible to predict the market&#039;s behavior

				It does not matter if a market is financial or barter based even. Everything in the world works on supply and demand. Follow those laws and you should be able to understand any type of question. Most of the time you can answer for yourself. And yes, Please people get on to SR and do what sugarmama does! We need to keep recycling our dirty money. And vendors need more ways to cash out!

				I thought there were some quite good commentators wrote about this, who had previously written about BItcoin. Peeps on the forum thought it would be the start of a crackdown on BItcoin, following the same logic. Yes, it&#039;s supply and demand, but the demand would appear to be anonymity, so where else is the cash going?<br /><br />Anom, like your thinking....

				Bitcoin Vendors Heed our Call!<br /><br />Does Bitinstant not work for you? I find its the best alternative for me. Go in to Walmart with a fake name, and pay in cash (they don&#039;t ask for ID, but if they do either say you don&#039;t have it or walk out). Dispose of the receipts properly. and there&#039;s nothing to draw back to you. I use a new name and new address every time and switch between 3 Walmarts. Never had an issue. Moneygram seems to be the best means of getting bitcoins right now.<br /><br />We need some new BTC vendors. Where&#039;s BST when you need em?
