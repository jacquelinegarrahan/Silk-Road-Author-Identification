Many <br />&nbsp; people are still using short keys. Lucky Green&#039;s e-mail sheds a <br />&nbsp; light on this phenomenon. He wrote &quot;In light of the above, I <br />&nbsp; reluctantly revoked all my personal 1024-bit PGP keys and the large <br />&nbsp; web-of-trust that these keys have acquired over time.&quot; The web of <br />&nbsp; trust attached to those keys was of great value, and reestablishing <br />&nbsp; it with a new set of keys will be difficult and time-consuming. <br />&nbsp; To Green, that pain was more important than having a &quot;long enough&quot; <br />&nbsp; key.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&nbsp; In light of the above, I reluctantly revoked all my personal 1024-bit<br />&nbsp; PGP keys and the large web-of-trust that these keys have acquired over<br />&nbsp; time.

Signing a new key with an old one merely demonstrates ownership of both old and new keys.&nbsp; It does not transfer the trust from the old keys to the new one. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#039;t think of a rational reason this is a good feature of a web of trust system. The longer and more consistent people are trusted the better surely.<br /><br />Is there any ideas for circumventing this caveat of a PGP web of trust system? Perhaps by a &#039;refresh&#039; or &#039;rebuild&#039; procedure on the PGP key servers, where one day in the year everybody receives a message to sign a bunch of certificates. e.g. PGP Day or something. I mean, you have their email in the PGP email field feature, you might as well utilize it.
