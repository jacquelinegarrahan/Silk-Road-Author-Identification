				Calm down....Postal carriers are not perfect, often far from it.<br /><br />If yours does not arrive in a couple days it may have been intercepted.<br /><br />This is not uncommon particularly since the 2 orders were packaged differently, they may use separate sorting machines<br /><br />and therefore different delivery dates

				hi, <br />wird schon kommen, ich hab von 10 bestellungen seit jänner 9 bekommen, nur eine ist verschwunden. ich denke, das ist bei unserer<br />post ein grosser erfolg. gut die hälfte war aus holland und die sind alle angekommen. wobei es vom selben verkäufer mal 4 tage und einmal<br />über eine woche gedauert hat. für die lieferung, die verschwunden ist, habe ich 30% nachgeschickt bekommen und die waren innnerhalb von drei tagen da.<br />also chill mal, alles nicht so schlimm und der worst case ist ein verlust von ein paar btc/E. es gibt schlimmeres<br />lg ;)<br />&nbsp;

				your fine man, it is so common for mail to get moved around and what not, you are fine. I have heard of people getting 2 packages from the same place, same guy, same time, and one will take a week longer. USPS just blows lol and plus luckily you only got a gram of hash which all they would do with that is toss it and laugh cuz its not worth their time<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

				My god man, calm down.<br /><br />Your freaking out for no reason<br /><br />This isn&#039;t like going down the street to buy groceries<br /><br />Chill out and wait, like everyone else.<br /><br />If you cannot handle waiting for inconsistencies in shipping to work out, THEN SR IS NOT FOR YOU<br /><br />This is not your vendors fault<br /><br />You are not busted<br /><br />You just need to grow-up and be patient

				at first when i am speak with my vendor he says :<br />no problem, it&#039;ll come. i have to admit, i will become more prompt with my orders again, but i first have to set up a computer system that will automate most of my stuff. i have adhd, i travell the silk road, so openining 9 messages a day and waiting 4 seconds for each to open up. Then finalizing early (daily practice) and all info is gone. (with the the effect that a VWINM (Vendor Who is not me), might _copy_ those details, as FE is such a part of daily practice... just look around a few vendor pages.<br />that will soon all be over, because by my sheer will and the help of a legendary speeddealer in amsterdam ;), i&#039;ve been building a system to take care of that.<br />it&#039;ll be a few days more,<br />this was 4 days bevor. and yesterday he says:it should be arriving shortly...<br />i only ask him to say me the shipping day but he does...he says only it should be arriving shortly... what should i do?

				Sounds like your vendor is a bit unorganized, doesn&#039;t sound like a scammer, scammer&#039;s usually just don&#039;t respond<br /><br />I probably wouldn&#039;t use them again<br /><br />As for your current order that you are waiting on.....<br /><br />Well, not much you can do aside from continue to wait.... It will most likely show up, just late...<br /><br />It is your choice as to when you can take action against the vendor.<br /><br />Once you decide enough is enough and you want your money back, you click the resolve link in your &quot;orders&quot; page<br /><br />I would wait some more though, your package is most likely been shipped late.<br /><br />I have never gone through the resolution process but I hear it takes a good deal of time<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t expect to get any bitcoin back for at least 2 weeks after you begin the resolution process<br /><br />

				i&#039;ve seen some paranoid/impatient posts on here, but this one takes the cake!&nbsp; The post office doesn&#039;t always operate the way you might expect - you can&#039;t order shit from here w/ a 100% probability it&#039;s going to show up the exact day you want it to - and complaining that it ain&#039;t fair, isn&#039;t gonna get it there any faster!&nbsp; go to your buddies and smoke some of his...and if yours don&#039;t show up in a week or so, then talk to the vendor.&nbsp; and you should really change the thread title, you&#039;re not busted, just very impatient.<br /><br /><br /><br />
