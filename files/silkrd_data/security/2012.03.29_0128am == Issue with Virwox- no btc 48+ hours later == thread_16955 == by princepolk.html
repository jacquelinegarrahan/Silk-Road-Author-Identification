				Hi all, <br /><br />I recently used Virwox to buy roughly 8 btc. After I bought them, I put in to withdraw them to my btc wallet, and got the standard warning about some orders taking up to 48 hours for manual confirmation. I was pointed to virwox by a pal who has used it for high value purchases, and vouched for it as well as said it had never really taken longer than 6-12 hrs for btc to be transferred, so I was surprised they hadn&#039;t appeared yet. So, I emailed their customer support asking about them. No response, so about 5 or 6 hours later and still no btc I emailed again, sending <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi again, <br />&nbsp;<br />I emailed you earlier with regards to an issue I&#039;m having but got no response. I withdrew 8 bitcoins from virwox, and they seem to have disappeared from existence. They aren&#039;t in my wallet or virwox account, and its going on 36 hours now. Please get back to me.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;I got a form response a while later saying <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello,<br />&nbsp;<br />for security reasons we manually check some bitcoin withdrawals (in particular of new accounts), as described in our FAQ (https://www.virwox.com/faq.php#_manual). This can take up to 48 hours.<br />&nbsp;<br />Greetings,<br />&nbsp;<br />VirWoX Support<br />&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and then two lines below that, in a different font and color (aka, clearly typed in by a person)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PS: your withdrawal has been 28 hours ago.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Seemed a little nasty for an honest mistake- the clocks on their site are a very dif time zone than me and I got confused. I responded with an apology an acknowledgement and sat down to wait. A day later, it has now been over 48 hours. I emailed them a bit ago asking for an update and haven&#039;t gotten any response. No btc yet. I was searching the forums a few minutes ago for similar experiences and someone had linked https://blockexplorer.com/address/[insert the key they were sent to here] as a way to see if there has been any activity. When I put in my key, this is the result I got. <br /><br />First seen?: Never used on the network (as far as I can tell)<br />Received transactions: 0<br />Received BTC: 0<br />Public key?:<br />Unknown (not seen yet)<br /><br />That&#039;s when i got worried, bc (albiet I&#039;m a newb) it sure looks like they haven&#039;t done anything towards sending me my funds and its already past the back end of their promise. I know that its not that much money but I needed it to have enough btc to make a particular order, and I really dont like the idea of being scammed (for a tiny sum!) by what seemed like a reputable firm. Anyone have any ideas?? Thanks greatly!

				I&#039;ve done a lot of withdrawals from them, and it&#039;s probably taken 48 hours every time. Just sit tight, let us know how things go.
