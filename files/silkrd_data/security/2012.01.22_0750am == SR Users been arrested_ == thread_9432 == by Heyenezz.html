				I&#039;m definitely interested in this subject.<br /><br />I have not yet seen one verifiable or trustworthy post regarding a bust of an SR user.<br /><br />If someone can spread some light on the subject, and give some verifiable DETAILS (i.e. some methods used for investigation / evidence gathering), I think we&#039;d all find it immensely valuable. Otherwise, I suppose no news is good news.<br /><br />Rocker

				I wonder if this is the source of misunderstanding. I posted a link to drugs-forum.com in which someone details how the USPS and the MS Narcotic division worked together to bust a user who was ordering drugs over the internet which led to a search of his house too. It is an old post but here is the link:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3231&amp;highlight=arrests<br /><br />Also, I speculated that with political pressure on the DEA to do something about Silk Road, the only viable option would be to bust a lot of users and put the trust of using SR at risk. You&#039;d never know if you were buying from a LEO. Can they just keep track of who buys illegal drugs over the internet and then bust you at a later point in time when they&#039;ve collected enough names and addresses or do you still have to have the drugs when they arrive?<br /><br />rusty

I still have faith in this project though, and hope to find that everything has been a misunderstanding.

				When the busts happen, they will be aimed at as many people as possible. I think right now LE is letting people get complacent enough to think that this sort of system is secure enough to not really have to worry about. Inevitably, people will fail to use proper security measures because of this. I&#039;ve seen some pretty sloppy operating procedures on here in my short time, and I guarantee it would not be hard to track down some vendors. I speculate that LE will do a mass bust, because just busting a vendor or two or a handful of buyers will only scare everyone else off the site and prevent them from building cases against them too. They&#039;ll want as big a haul as they can manage.

This makes sense to me because if SR were more publicized many, many more people would flock to the site. <br /><br />...to my point.

Silk Road is NOT high traffic. Think about this for a second. How much $$ is trafficked here on SR? 22 million last year was the last estimate I heard. That&#039;s chump change compared to the 12 BILLION annual market via traditional distribution. If you are the DEA with limited funding and personnel, would you task a dozen people with college degrees to track down a few vendors on SR, or each of them confiscating half a ton of cocaine at the border?<br /><br />There is risk here, to be sure. But in my opinion it&#039;s not high on the DEA&#039;s list. With 5,000 agents trying to stop all drug trafficking in, out of, and withing the united states, how many do you think are engaged in busting SR? Not too many. I&#039;d be amazed if it&#039;s more than a few dozen, so long as we don&#039;t have any more senators politicking by calling for its demise.<br /><br />

				I understand there&#039;s been a few busts of SR users, I&#039;ve heard of one in Australia but it was down to the purchaser being extremely sloppy in real life &amp; dealing out of his own home.<br /><br />Most busts I believe have been down to people talking, obviously selling &amp; other real life fuckups rather than investigations into SR, though this is just speculation.

				Fear mongering threads ARE deleted.&nbsp; I noticed this too.&nbsp; Also deleted are any posts that may compete with SR such as other escrow services out there.<br /><br />Lots of posts get deleted that may inhibit people to shop and buy.&nbsp; They even try to hide the glitches and problems with security.&nbsp; The image hack a few months ago was a good example.&nbsp; They only reported it when they had no choice.&nbsp; And even then,&nbsp; some vendors went offline because there was no way to tell how deep this hack reaches or what .&nbsp; The. The recent bitcoin appearing and disappearing.&nbsp; They wouldn&#039;t say anything or shut down the site until it was too late or there was a risk of loosing money for SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;It could have been reported right away.&nbsp; It o Lu takes a few seconds to write a mass message to everyone right ?&nbsp; It didn&#039;t go out , just a tiny wee little post by dpr saying don&#039;t worry just wait .&nbsp; He was right .&nbsp; He always is .&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />But it&#039;s a business here .&nbsp; You can see how vendors would put pressure on SR to delete these posts that could slow sales.&nbsp; It&#039;s good business.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Oompaloompa - <br /><br />May I ask what you think of handwritten labels, and should a vendor stating that something was delivered (unconfirmed) in the same state without issue, do you believe this is reasonable to suspect that its the fault of a buyer? <br /><br />Just want to know for educational purposes, ofc.

They would never let the drugs out of their sight. Maybe they could collect a few addresses before but after a few no shows the gig would be up.

It is claimed that due to the use of triplicate carbon copy papers that must be used for express mailing all labels are handwritten. Does this sound accurate?&nbsp; Im just trying to rule out anything that may be false.

				Ask the post office, I don&#039;t know, though it sounds fishy. Businesses send things express delivery, so does amazon, lawyers etc. Wouldn&#039;t expect to see official documents from a lawyer with a hand written address.

				Thank you for such a fast response. <br /><br /><br />I have never seen a label handwritten, from ANY business. And I have them sent quite a lot. So that argument is kind of weak. Still doesnt say they wouldnt, but it just does not seem professional , as you stated as well. <br />P.S. Stay tuned, within the next few days. If I am not posting....&nbsp; :(

				hahahah, thank you!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Also, yes, I vividly remember that they brought it to you - - I just meant that wherever they intercepted it along the way, they would not have made any kind of comment saying so on the online tracking info.&nbsp; They wouldn&#039;t have wanted to tip anyone off and possibly give them time to clean house.

				I don&#039;t know if any one mentioned this yet in any of these threads. But, the few cases that are known I don&#039;t think the SR connection was discovered till after the fact or Sr connection is speculative at best. Of course that does not stop the media or LEO from exaggerating the story.
