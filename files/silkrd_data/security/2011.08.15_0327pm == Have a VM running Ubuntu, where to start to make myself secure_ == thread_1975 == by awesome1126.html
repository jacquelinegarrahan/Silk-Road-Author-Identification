				Hey there, I have had my virtualbox and ubuntu programs for a while, but didn&#039;t get around to installing them and getting the guest OS running until recently. The host is a mac running leopard, and I&#039;m wondering what is the best way for me to keep myself secure using this setup? I have read that running things using a VM is the way to go, but I don&#039;t exactly know where to start.<br /><br />Should I run TAILS from the Guest OS (Ubuntu)? Or should I just install the Tor browser bundle and truecrypt and all that. I&#039;ve read some things about isolation, but I don&#039;t want to start anything until I know the pros and cons of each, which seem pretty hard to narrow down in these huge posts.<br /><br />What I&#039;m basically asking is which way is going to provide me the best technical security?<br />

				I would think the best way would be to install the Virtual Machine on a USB stick, and then encrypt that.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t gotten that far, yet.<br /><br />The tor browser bundle package you are talking about is the easiest way to install TOR and Firefox, and be safe.<br />When you exit, pretty much everything is gone.<br /><br />I wanted system that used security but I could still use my favorite toys.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to install a tor vidalia polipo package on Ubuntu.<br /><br />http://kyleabaker.com/2011/01/11/how-to-setup-and-use-tor-anonymity-in-ubuntu/<br />Remember to let Vidaiia take permanent control.<br />Then install the TOR button in Firefox, and you are off and running.<br /><br />To install Pidgin with SILC.<br /><br />http://www.unixmen.com/software/1788-pidgin-290-released-download-ppa<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the reply! I&#039;ll check those links out and I&#039;ll start to get that system set up... does anyone know the importance of, or how to isolate firefox from Tor? I&#039;m planning on running Tor on the guest and not the host, is this the right idea?

				Yea that&#039;s the right idea.<br />Most important is that you encrypt the VM guest file.<br /><br />There are people trying to get the entire VM to go through a TOR proxy on the host, but I haven&#039;t seen anyone successful in that, but keep your eyes open for that since it&#039;d be the best.<br /><br />In the guest OS:<br />start tor (through vidalia or whatever you prefer)<br />get the tor firefox addon.<br /><br />And just to be on the safe side you can set your global proxy settings so all other applications that detect for local proxy automatically goes through tor as well.<br />That&#039;s usually in System Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; Network proxy<br />should be set to something like socks: 127.0.0.1:9050 check in your tor config or vidalia to verify the port.<br /><br />you can see if you are successfully running tor by accessing any .onion domain or going to:<br />https://check.torproject.org/<br /><br />And NEVER do non-tor browsing with your guest OS, use it exclusively for tor.<br />If you run a bitcoin client in your guest, make sure it connects through tor (just google how to do that)<br />
