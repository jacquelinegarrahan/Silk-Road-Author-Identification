				I just wanted to check my security is OK to start vending:<br /><br />1. Spoof MAC address<br />2. Connect to an unsecured network a few blocks away<br />3. Run the TOR bundle<br />4. Connect<br /><br />All data is stored on a hidden/encrypted drive via TrueCrypt, all communication is encrypted via PGP.<br /><br />Anything else I need to do?

				Not bad, better than a lot of vendors here probably, but using virtual machines to isolate each aspect of your tor operation would be better.

In MS Windows look at Advanced Properties &gt; Network Adress of your wifi card in Hardware Management. Change from None to specify one. For *nix OS the QTC&#039;s suggestion works.<br /><br />Virtualisation software can be additional layer of performance loss or even privacy leak. This depends both from Host OS and visualization software your run. You must encrypt all parent OS drives with TrueCrypt anyway.
