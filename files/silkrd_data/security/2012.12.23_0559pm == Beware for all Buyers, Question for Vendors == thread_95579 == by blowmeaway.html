				Somebody who bought from him around his location was actually robbed by him the day after and gave a negative review that was actually deleted! <br />Now he may have made that all up but i hardly doubt it.<br />QUESTION FOR VENDORS: vendors, are you allowed to delete some of your own reviews made after finalization?

There is no way to delete the IMPACT of the reviews/feedback. There are ways to hide the feedback.<br /><br />Clearly it isn&#039;t common-knowledge however, so I&#039;m going to stick with only telling it to the vendors I already trust, who are having problems with assholes trying to blackmail them.<br /><br />But to answer OP: Yes, it would be possible for the vendor to hide feedback that says, for example, that the person got robbed the day after.

				wait wait wait, so you&#039;re saying some buyer did something shitty and someone (the vendor or associate of) fucked the buyer up?? that&#039;s pretty fuckin scary. but I guess if you&#039;re accidentally fucking with a dude who has a lot of people in his/her group it doesn&#039;t sound impossible. PO box anyone? haha
