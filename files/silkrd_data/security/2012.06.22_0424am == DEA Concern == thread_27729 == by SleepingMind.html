				Absolutely nothing. You&#039;re not at any risk or even on their radar. <br /><br />To be honest you can get this stuff from your doctor in seconds, so I wonder why you even want to buy it from here, but that&#039;s not my business.

				Seriously man? You title your post DEA Concern and you&#039;re post has nothing to do with the DEA. If you&#039;re scared go to church. <br />On another note, just read the forums and look around. Tons of business is being conducted. Im sure your gram will be fine.

				Are you fucking serious you&#039;re going to order viagra? what the fuck are you trying to do blow up the whole fucking planet?&nbsp; Better make sure your vendor vacuum seals that shit 40x no more no less if he does 41 or 39 you&#039;re pretty much fucked so you better make sure he knows basic math.&nbsp; If they catch you with that shit you better pray to fucking god heaven and hell don&#039;t exist.&nbsp; only the scummiest of the scummiest terrorists import viagra.&nbsp; If I were you I&#039;d go easy and just start a human trafficking business, it&#039;s much safer and it has health benefits I heard.

				even more so than the vac seal, they should probably encase it in lead if possible, so it doesn&#039;t emit any radiation that could be picked up by the mail carrier geiger counter.

				these gave me a good laugh, was thinking though to be extra safe perhaps it would be a better idea to travel to the source and kiester them and smuggle them back yourself. or perhaps go ahead and swallow when you hook up at the source since a huge rock hard boner would be harder to detect going through customs. <br /><br />for real though you should have no prob. if your in usa maybe order domestic to ease you into how the road works. ive ordered sum from collapse before and they came no prob. also Off The Wagon has some from time to time and hes a good guy to deal with. theres plenty of other vendors to sort through as well who are equally as legit just read recent feedback and do your homework and make an educated purchase. soon your eyes will be opened to a&nbsp; whole new world and you wont think of the mail the same. welcome to the road and enjoy your bonin&#039;

				Everyone here is right.<br /><br />First go and make up some bullshit to your doctor. <br /><br />If that doesnt work come here.<br /><br />If police intercept it (0.00001%),,,, deny all knowledge.<br /><br />If you feel sketchy when they deliver it and you feel like its a controlled delivery, take the package inside, write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; across the front. And leave it a day or two.<br /><br />That way you know you&#039;re 100% fine. Everyone here will tell you the same thing

				honestly they are not going to do a CD for personal use amounts of viagra, a shit load of people order it illegally online and I have never heard of anyone getting more than a love letter. The same is true for personal use amounts of xanax and other benzos as well (not the case for opiates though). <br /><br />they tend to take the position that people ordering viagra online are the victims of spam pharmacies and haven&#039;t even the slightest clue that what they are doing is illegal or that what they are ordering is not officially produced viagra, and this is overwhelmingly the case.

				Hahaha! This is great :)<br /><br /><br />I sell a lot of viagra on SR. Truth is I&#039;m probably cheaper than your local pharmacy. In the US viagra is still under patent and that shit is almost $10 a pill. I sell 2 pills for less than $10 and it&#039;s exactly the same stuff.
