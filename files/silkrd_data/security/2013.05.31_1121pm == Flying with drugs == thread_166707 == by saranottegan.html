				Okay, so in a few weeks, I&#039;ve gotta take a flight to deal with relatives I am not fond of. (Death in the family.)&nbsp; Not checking any luggage. Mainly taking pills with me that are almost identical to some I&#039;m prescribed. No problem there.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also want to take my snuff kit, which has an exacto blade, small coke bump spoon, small mirror and a metal tooter. Also want to take about 1/4gr of H. Will the x-ray pick up my H if I have it in a baggie and throw it in a change pocket of my jeans or fold it into some socks and put it in the carry-on bag? <br /><br />Also, any ideas on packing the different parts of the snuff kit? Can I hide parts of it under the soles of other shoes that will be in the bag? Any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks, in advance....

				I&nbsp; recommend you check in some luggage and put all your naughtiness in that.<br />The x-ray machine _will_ find any blades you&#039;re carrying... <br />(razor blades, nail clippers, small scissors.. etc)<br />and if these security people find anything that looks like <br />a coke mirror and spoon... then you are, technically speaking ... fucked!<br /><br />but...you knew all this already, right ?<br /><br />..&nbsp; is it really necessary to take coke to a funeral ?

				The snuff kit doesn&#039;t seem like a good idea, or necessary - I&#039;m sure you can find a way to ingest your drug of choice without it. <br /><br />As far as the actual drugs, I&#039;m no expert on the subject, and I&#039;ve been contemplating it myself. My idea is to put coke in empty capsules and put them in a pill bottle of some innocuous OTC medication or vitamin. And then there&#039;s always body cavities, which I&#039;ve done. This was before the days of the body scanners, but it&#039;s my understanding that those won&#039;t pick up anything inside your body, just on the outside of your body, under your clothes. Is that right? But regardless, you can always opt for the pat-down in that situation.

				Have flown many times with various substances, seems like you get the idea. Would avoid putting anything, specifically metal, under the inserts of your shoes... TSA or equivalent will make you remove your shoes and put them through the x-ray machine as you walk through the metal detector. This wouldn&#039;t look good at all.

				I&#039;ve flown with personal stashes regularly and never had a problem. As long as the quantity is closer to personal than distributable I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much to worry about: most frequent business travelers are carrying at least one or two prescriptions, as well as a mountain of favored toiletries, and x-rays can&#039;t tell the difference between a pot of eyeshadow and any other sort of powder. As long as you package the stuff to look like cosmetics or toiletries you&#039;re fine. Baggies, though? Not so much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;d leave the kit. You can pick up blades anywhere and why risk getting snagged with a coke spoon when you buy a Bic pen and makeup mirror as soon as you get past security? It&#039;s not worth it, imo. Anyway, you have a few weeks. Put together a plastic kit and you&#039;ll be all set.&nbsp;

				I was just wondering, after re-reading the posts above..<br /><br />does ROA = Route of Administration ?<br />If not, what is it?<br /><br />What does DOC stand for ?

Whatever you choose I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine though. TSA is more concerned with trafficking than it is bagging the occasional addict. :) <br /><br />Good luck!

				I have had MDMA with me on many NL-&gt;Other EU country flights. I made a small package of it and duct taped it between my nutsack and anus and never had a problem. I have also taken LSD with me by just putting it in my wallet. Good luck mate!
