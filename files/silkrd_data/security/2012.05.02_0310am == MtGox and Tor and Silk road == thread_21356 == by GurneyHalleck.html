				At the MtGox website it says that any tranfers made vie the tor network will raise red flags and lead to problems (not in exactly those words, but that&#039;s the gist).&nbsp; So if I use bitinstant to get bitcoins, how do i get them to Silk Road without going through MtGox?&nbsp; I am a complete newb here but I am ready to do some business if I could just comprehend the process.<br /><br />As I understand it, I go to the bitinstant website and tell them i want $100 usd sent to MtGox (or some alternative like Crypto Xchange) and then I am given some account details and I go to my nearest big box bank and deposit the $100 usd and after i pay the commission, the bitcoins appear in my MtGox account.&nbsp; How do i then send those bitcoins to Silk Road without using the Tor network?&nbsp; Obviously I am confused and am missing some critical piece of information.<br /><br />A step by step walkthrough would be greatly appreciated, taking into consideration that I have absolutely no idea what i am doing, and have never worked with bitcoins at all.&nbsp; In fact I just downloaded the Tor browser a few hours ago, expressly to do some business on Silk Road.

				Your not confused.&nbsp; In my understanding you have to use MTGOX through the clearnet.

				Alas, I have no idea what the clearnet is.&nbsp; Are the other alternatives to Mtgox Tor-friendly?&nbsp;

				Not sure.&nbsp; &nbsp; The clearnet is like the regular web.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darknet/Clearnet

				Clearnet is the regular internet.<br /><br />Pasted from another post, I forgot who posted it but the credit is theirs:<br /><br /><br />Log onto Tor.<br /><br />Go to bitinstant and start cash deposit at bank order.<br /><br />Find the bank near you at their cash processor, not too near.<br /><br />Present the teller the letter and EXACT cash.<br /><br />By the time you get home you should have email stating the order is completed, it usually completes in 30 min. Otherwise call from a payphone or just your cellphone if you aren&#039;t paranoid.<br /><br />CONNECT to instawallet.org and copy down the URL. Do this in your clipboard and on paper, once you lose the URL you lose your coins.<br />ALSO copy down the bitcoin address, on paper.<br /><br />Log OFF tor.<br /><br />Connect to Mt.Gox and you will have the USD, make a trade for bitcoins. I always wait for a good deal.<br /><br />When completed, send the BTC to the instawallet bitcoin address. DO NOT CHECK IT YET. Verify on MT.GOX.<br /><br />EXIT browser.<br /><br />LOG ON tor.<br /><br />Check instawallet and proceed. Otherwise, wait ten minutes, if no BTC has arrived, log off tor, onto Mt.Gox and contact support. Never log on to that instawallet with your real ip.<br /><br />Wait an hour or five for the BTC to go into the instawallet and then transfer to SR bitcoin address.<br />(If it&#039;s a large sum of BTC, separate into several random amounts into other instawallets, write down URLs and BTC addresses, then repeat for SR)<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br /><br />tl:dr-&nbsp; Use regular internet to transfer your coins off of MtGox and into instawallet.org (save the URL for the wallet, send coins to the instawallet address), get on Tor, transfer coins from instawallet to SR.&nbsp; Never access instawallet without Tor during this process.&nbsp;

				Above poster gives excellent advice. His method should be pretty fool proof except for the fact that MTgox contains your information so it is possible to trace the bitcoins to you. But I&#039;m just stating a limitation to this method since pretty much every way of doing it has at least one. You shouldn&#039;t really be raising any red flags this way at all.

				Thanks folks, that seems to cover all the bases!&nbsp; Now to find an appropriate free wifi spot from which to do my transfers, so it can&#039;t be traced back to my IP and I&#039;ll be in business!

If you want to be anonymous of free wifi spots spoof your MAC address before you login then do all your business. When you leave return you MAC address to its original.
