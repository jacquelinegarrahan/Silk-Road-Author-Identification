				i have just come to discover SR and i am happy.&nbsp; first of all, what is the best provider of bitcoins in your opinion?&nbsp; second, i just read a post about bitcoins that was not very useful. it turned out to be an argument about safety/anonymity.&nbsp; &nbsp;i don&#039;t care if people know i&#039;m buying bitcoins, i only care if they see the transaction from my SR account to the seller.&nbsp; isn&#039;t that the whole point of Tor browser relating to SR?&nbsp; once the bitcoins are sent to my SR account at KHdkdg774hJHYdjd8884hfhf&nbsp; or whatever, they are off the grid and anonymous yes?&nbsp; or no?<br /><br />thank you in advance

				There is alot of debate as to how much security is required on the bitcoin issues, The security sub forums has many guides so you could make your own decisions as to your level of security. Bitcoin purchases are&nbsp; dependent to what part of the world you are in. you will also find this info in the above mentioned location. There are a ton of threads on buying bitcoins so i will also point out the search button in the top right. The UK purchases are changing atm so you would only want to find very recent threads.

Everything is legal up until you purchase something illegal with the intention on having it sent to you.<br /><br />Look into GPG encryption.<br />&nbsp;:)

				Look, buying BTC is legal, but it doesn&#039;t look good if you&#039;re getting busted for a different slip up. <br /><br />Since it is relatively easy to run a clean PC, and obscure your BTC transaction, why not do it. If you want to cut corners because its a (small) hassle, I think that suggests you&#039;ll cut corners elsewhere.
