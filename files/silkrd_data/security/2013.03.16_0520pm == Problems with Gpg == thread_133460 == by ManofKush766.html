				Hello guys, have recently had problems with my version of GPG called Kleopatra. I had copy/pasted the certificate into a notepad, successfully imported it and now I have the question as to where/how to send my encrypted address to my vendor. They have no registered email address and whenever I try to copy/paste the encrypted address into TorBrowser, the only results I get are boxes (I assume that TorBrowser cannot read the characters and sets them as a box instead). Either way, the address is not read-able. Please help because my vendor is of none.

				I do everything thru GPA, I don&#039;t use Kleo. <br />&nbsp; <br /><br />But if you use plain GPA, I highlight and copy the dealer&#039;s public key and save it in a text file on my desktop. Then I open GPA up, click the menu item &#039;Keys&#039;, hit &#039;import keys&#039; and when that opens maneuver to the desktop or wherever you have saved the text file (usually I have to go to the root of the directory and then drill down to the desktop, it doesn&#039;t seem to see a new text document without &#039;refreshing&#039; it) <br />Also you have to save it as a txt file, it won&#039;t recognize a word or odf (OpenOffice) document. Once you click open after highlighting or clicking on the txt file, it will take a second and give you a little screen saying that it&#039;s imported one key, etc. <br /><br />It took me a couple of days to figure out, what I was first blaming GPA for I found out that I had a wrong conception of what was happening. You have to import the public key of the person you are meessaging. He uses YOUR public key to encrypt messages to you. You can&#039;t import a PGP message as a key, and you need to check that you haven&#039;t cut off any dashes (5 dashes) when you &#039;cut&#039; the public key and paste it to a txt file. <br /><br />I&#039;ll help if I can.

				It sounds like you successfully imported the person&#039;s public key. To message him in GPA, open the clipboard, and type in your address or what ever you want to send him. Then hit &#039;encrypt&#039; at the top of screen, and a list of keys that you have previously imported come up and you need to pick the key of the person you are messaging. Sometimes the key will be marked differently than you think, it has to do with how the person made his public key and the info he entered then. GPA asks you if you want to encrypt the message using &#039;X&#039; person&#039;s key, and after clicking ok you have the encrypted message which you then highlight and copy and later paste in the SR order form. Or you can later message him with a PM with your message.
