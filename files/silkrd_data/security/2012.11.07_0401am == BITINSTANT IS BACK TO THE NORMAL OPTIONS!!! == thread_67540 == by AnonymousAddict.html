				As of now 12:25pm pacific, bitinstant will not allow me to access it with tor, instead I get this message:<br />Access Denied<br />The owner of this website (www.bitinstant.com) has banned your IP address (xx.xxx.xxx.xxx). (Ref. xxxx)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Timestamp: Thu, 08 Nov 2012 12:17:04 -0800<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your IP address: xx.xxx.xxx.xxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Requested URL: www.bitinstant.com/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Error reference number: xxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Server ID: FL_xxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Process ID: PID_xxxxxxxxxx.xxx-x-xxxxxxxxx<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0<br />I can however access bitinstant with my clearnet browser and works like it used to except now they ask for a full name and birth date. I guess I could buy some BTC anyway then launder it, but I think I&#039;ll wait and see what develops.<br />I&#039;d much rather aquire my BTC with total anonymity start to finish, maybe another vendor will step up and accept Tor connections.

				Update to my update:<br />I just refreshed the denial of access page and it now it&#039;s working fine. Accessing bitinstant through Tor is now working, but they are still asking for a full name and DOB for a deposit to btc wallet address. I&#039;m going to try a fake name for a bank branch cash deposit, let you know how it goes later.

				BitInstant is NOT back to normal. It&#039;s dead. They now require your name and date of birth to do OFAC (Office of Foreign Asset Control) checks thru the US Department of the Treasury. It is also not accessible thru tor. I would suspect them investigating fake names or frequent deposits. Wouldnt it be easy for them to get your IP on clearnet? They weren&#039;t under any attack, they were busy bending over for the law. All the info is on their blog<br /><br />http://blog.bitinstant.com/

				I just successfully proccessed a cash deposit ---&gt; BTC Address. Aside from a minor hiccup (detailed above) it went flawlessly. Here was my exact experience:<br /><br />Used TOR to create a wallet at blockchain.info<br /><br />Travelled to a local hotspot in town to complete Bitinstant steps.<br />At Bitinstant, I chose Cash Deposit (Walmart) ---&gt; BTC Address<br />I inputted the temp. wallet address, a fake name, fake birthday, and a tormail address. <br />On the ZipZap page I also inputted a fake phone # and chose a Walmart location.<br />I saved the generated .pdf, drove home, and printed it.<br /><br />I then travelled to the Walmart location, and showed the clerk the slip I just printed. She had me fill out a blue MoneyGram slip. This again asked for name, address, and phone #. I used the same fake information on the slip as I did with Bitinstant. Only thing extra that was needed was an address. Before filling this out I told the clerk that I forgot my ID and asked if that would be a problem. She said ID was not needed as long as I was just paying a bill.<br /><br />I checked my Blockchain wallet 45 mins later and my BTC was there, along with a confirmation email from Bitinstant. A flawless, and anonymous experience thanks to Bitinstant.<br /><br />Now if only SR was up...

				I don&#039;t think this is a case of BI bending over for the law as much as it is them covering their own asses. I really don&#039;t see why they still can&#039;t allow Tor IPs to access their site, but I&#039;m sure there is a good reason.<br /><br />As long as you go to a hotspot (as mentioned above), and use a location that does not check your ID, you&#039;re still anonymous and untraceable AS LONG AS YOU DON&#039;T TELL ON YOURSELF!<br /><br />There&#039;s a price to pay for your safety, it just depends on how much you&#039;re willing to pay. Me personally, I&#039;m happy to drag my black (or white, or maybe brown) ass to a hotspot to remain anonymous so that bitinstant can stay functioning. I&#039;m sure feds are putting a lot of pressure on these people and we have to think what we would do if we were in their shoes.<br /><br />Think about it- if they were really trying to track you, they would have added a &quot;MANDATORY TO SHOW ID&quot; step on their processing slips for the clerk. I bet they were just getting pressured and probably even receiving threats from LE and had to respond. And since I already have a trustworthy processing location, traveling 5 min to one of the many hotspots in my area is a small price to pay for anonymity.

				Based on what I&#039;ve heard, every location is different about their ID requirements. My local Moneygram provider has never asked me for ID. I have a whole fake name, number, and address. I use the same one every time and they&#039;ve never asked for ID. I mean hopefully anonymous bank deposits become an option again soon, but until then you can definitely make do.

				A thing to keep in mind when choosing your processing location with Bitinstant:<br /><br />TRY TO PICK WHOLE IN THE WALL CHECK-CASHING JOINTS.<br /><br />When you&#039;re finishing your ticket on bitinstant, it shows you a bunch of places that process their orders. I stay away from big corporate chains where employees fear punishment for not following guidelines. Granted, at Wal-Mart you will likely get a redneck who doesn&#039;t care, anyway, but I still like the small, independently owned check cashing places.<br /><br />At the check cashing joints, they are mostly all owned independently and a lot of the times the owner or family member of the owner is working the register. And, the owners of these places are less likely to be as red about asking for ID.<br /><br />What I like to do is this:<br /><br />1.) Pretend like I don&#039;t know they&#039;re getting a small commission for processing the ticket.<br />2.) Before anything has begun processing, offer them an extra $5 ($10 if it&#039;s a larger amount) out of &quot;gratitude&quot;.<br />3.) If in the rare case they ask for ID, either say you forgot your wallet or it was stolen. I like the stolen wallet excuse because then you can give them the whole &quot;that&#039;s why I&#039;m using this bill pay option because they don&#039;t require ID, blah blah blah&quot;. It invokes pity and they will appreciate the gesture of paying the xtra $5 so they will feel guilty if they turn you away for not having a damn ID,<br />4.) 9/10 times they will tell you not to worry about it and process your order.<br />5.) Also, they hardly ever accept the extra $5, and will tell you they get a small commission anyways.<br /><br /><br />But, fore me, I&#039;ve been lucky enough to find an owner of one of these places that is a liberty-minded person (Ron Paul posters all over the place), and we&#039;ve established a pretty solid relationship so I don&#039;t have to dance the dance any longer. I feel kind of bad, though, because he only knows me by my alias and he is a very decent human being (he&#039;s offered me no interest loans before), and I am basically manipulating him. But, I would rather feel a little guilty than compromise my anonymity :).

				+1 Nellion<br /><br />I too use a local business that processes Moneygram because they don&#039;t check ID. I&#039;ve never tried Walmart or CVS, but I&#039;ve heard that some employees at those locations will give you a hard time. The best thing to do is create a new identity for yourself, memorize it, and from now on that&#039;s what the workers at that store will no you as. Make sure you practice a signature, it would look really stupid if you couldn&#039;t sign your own name.<br /><br />Also Nellion, that thing about pretending to lose ID is brilliant. That&#039;s exactly what I&#039;ll do if they ever ask. I doubt most workers would be able to look you in the eyes after you say that your wallet was stolen, and still say no. Excellent idea, and I&#039;ll be keeping it in my back pocket. I mean if it ever gets to a point where ID is suddenly required for all Moneygram transactions, I&#039;ll probably put up the money for a fake ID. The money I&#039;m making off the Silk Road is worth it anyways.

If in the rare case they ask for ID, either say you forgot your wallet or it was stolen. I like the stolen wallet excuse because then you can give them the whole &quot;that&#039;s why I&#039;m using this bill pay option because they don&#039;t require ID, blah blah blah&quot;. It invokes pity and they will appreciate the gesture of paying the xtra $5 so they will feel guilty if they turn you away for not having a damn ID,<br />4.) 9/10 times they will tell you not to worry about it and process your order.<br />5.) Also, they hardly ever accept the extra $5, and will tell you they get a small commission anyways.<br /><br /><br />But, fore me, I&#039;ve been lucky enough to find an owner of one of these places that is a liberty-minded person (Ron Paul posters all over the place), and we&#039;ve established a pretty solid relationship so I don&#039;t have to dance the dance any longer. I feel kind of bad, though, because he only knows me by my alias and he is a very decent human being (he&#039;s offered me no interest loans before), and I am basically manipulating him. But, I would rather feel a little guilty than compromise my anonymity :).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />this is cool. i guess +1 for ur help.. <br /><br />but shit i go to cvs.. and every single time they DONT ask for ID and i make up fake name..<br /><br />its easy and fast.. have my money in a matter of hours in SR after washing.. limit i think is like 1000 dollars or something<br /><br />

				just to be safe dont use your home ip.. go to like a coffee shop or public wifi.. They can log your ip to the transaction and if you dont wash the coins i assume they can just trace it back.. i think. although i am way way over the top usually
