				It sounds like you&#039;ve found a BTC vendor. They make their money by selling bitcoin for more than the current market price (or by charging a fee on top of it). Some make 10% or 20% on every deal they do. If you want to throw 10 to 20% of your money away, by all means do it. I&#039;ve heard they can be pretty fast. You typically have to buy a moneypak card for $5 and then load it up at a store register.<br /><br />The current market price in USD at Tradehill can be found here (it&#039;s the number after &quot;last&quot;, although technically the &quot;sell&quot; or &quot;ask&quot; would be the next price):<br />https://api.tradehill.com/APIv1/USD/Ticker<br /><br />The price at Mtgox can be found here:<br />https://mtgox.com/code/data/ticker.php<br /><br />The price at Mtgox is also mirrored here:<br />http://bitcoinprices.org/<br /><br />You can find many bid/ask prices for different currencies here:<br />http://www.bitcoinwatch.com/<br /><br />I believe the price that SR uses to price goods can be found on bitcoinwatch.com by looking for &quot;Currencies (Weighted Prices)&quot; and looking at the USD row and the 24h column. Or you could put an item in your cart and see how much BTC you need.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that there are BTC vendors on the bitcoin forums that charge zero fees, so you might want to check that out (but research your vendor first):<br />https://bitcointalk.org/<br /><br />You might also want to look into getbitcoin or bitinstant, which both charge 5%.
