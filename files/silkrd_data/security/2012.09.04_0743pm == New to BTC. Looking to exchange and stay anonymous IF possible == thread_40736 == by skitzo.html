				Whats a good route to go? A simple search online directed me to mtgox.com which is at 10.37 per coin. Just looking for some feedback seeing that mtgox is cheaper than most users on the market here. Just want to stay anonymous.

It must also be stated that you won&#039;t have to provide ID for withdrawals under 200 BTC; note, however, that in Mt.Gox&#039;s terms &amp; conditions they do state that you can be asked to provide identification at any time, without being given a reason.

Set up and access a Mt.Gox account through this and ensure you keep all withdrawals &lt; 200 BTC.

				grahamgreene - thanks for the further clarification about Mt. Gox.<br /><br />Overall I have just heard way too many people complain of Mt.

Gox isn&#039;t impossible to use anonymously, and that they don&#039;t freeze accounts as easily or as often as people seem to think.<br />Like most things concerning Bitcoin, if one researches their method fully to find out what to do and what not to do (finding out about accessing Mt. Gox via TOR for instance) they are far less likely to run into problems. The issues arise when people only do their research AFTER they have a problem. Prevention is better than the cure &#039;n all that!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				09g8gt - it&#039;s best to have an Intermediary step between you and SR. Sign up for an account through Tor for blockchain.info or any other wallet service and have your btc sent there first, tumble for extra security and then send it to your SR address.<br /><br />get-bitcoin --&gt; blockchain wallet --&gt; tumble --&gt; silkroad --&gt; buy stuff ;) --&gt; get stuff --&gt; be happy

				An interesting thread over at Reddit, i came upon today:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Set up an account (it now seems that someone else has blocked it by multiple failed login attempts, although that could have been due to me accessing it over Tor?) Got as far as going to add funds to the account by bank transfer to UK account details, but it said &quot;* Please be advised that accessing your account via the Tor network and/or public proxies may result in a temporary suspension of your account, and having to submit AML documents. &quot; My question is: what is the proper way to add/spend funds from this point on? Is making a direct transfer from my legitimate bank account a good idea? (not over Tor?) Also, how do you go about setting up a &#039;wallet&#039; once the BTC are bought? Sorry for silly questions, can&#039;t find the answers<br /><br />Also, what is the transfer limit at which I need to provide ID to mtgox?
