				Hello,<br /><br />I would like to consult the advice of some of you experts out there regarding &quot;grey market&quot; orders of &quot;research chemicals&quot; and other &quot;sketchy&quot; orders such as needles, lab equipment, etc.<br /><br />I realize these things aren&#039;t technically illegal, but surely the authorities are not stupid and will put you on some sort of watch list which might jeopardize orders from SR in the future. <br /><br />Specifically I am looking at PED&#039;s from places like napsgear, mpresearch, southern peptides etc as well as RC&#039;s that haven&#039;t been scheduled yet such as......well I dunno all of them yet just giving bromo-dragonFLY as an example (though I hear bad stories about that one and dont intent to use it, it&#039;s just an example). I have been on several bodybuilding and steroid forums where these meatheads brazenly order these substances with their credit cards, real bank accounts with their real names, saying stuff like &quot;they don&#039;t care if you want steroids just don&#039;t get caught with recreational drugs&quot;.<br /><br />I refuse to believe this drivel, especially given the complex measures to purchase items here on SR. Illegal is Illegal, simple as that. <br /><br />So, any other bodybuilding or RC afficionados have any ideas regarding this? Thanks

				I&#039;ve purchased RCs from the clearnet without any problems a few times. But I live in Brazil, and our version of the analog act is a joke.<br /><br />If I still lived in the USA, I&#039;d never even think of buying RCs with my real name attached to the payment. They aren&#039;t explicitly illegal, but they ARE illegal, and most of them are Schedule I analogs. I would not even go close.<br /><br />As for needles and all those other shenanigans, the police really don&#039;t have the time or manpower to watch everyone who buys them. Go crazy, you won&#039;t have any problems.

				I&#039;ve ordered a box of needles in the past when I was using PEDs<br />but it was just 1 box, had enough pins to last alot longer than my cycle/cycles<br />&nbsp;no problems... medical supplies are shipped in masses daily<br />I wouldnt be worried<br />but I wouldnt order any kind of RC, never used them and dont plan on it anytime soon<br />wouldnt order PEDs from the clearnet either. at the time I was getting them locally
