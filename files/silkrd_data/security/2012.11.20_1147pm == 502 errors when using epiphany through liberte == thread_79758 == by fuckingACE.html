				I was wondering if anyone could help with the following: <br /><br />Basically I&#039;m using Liberte with the default config, When I open up epiphany and browse through the forums on a single tab there are no problems. However when I ctrl click to open up multiple tabs at the same time I get a 502 error:<br /><br />&quot;No server or forwarder data received<br />Your request for http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=78980.0 could not be fulfilled, because the connection to dkn255hz262ypmii.onion (127.0.0.1) has been closed before Privoxy received any data for this request.<br /><br />This is often a temporary failure, so you might just try again.<br /><br />If you get this message very often, consider disabling connection-sharing (which should be off by default). If that doesn&#039;t help, you may have to additionally disable support for connection keep-alive by setting keep-alive-timeout to 0.&quot;<br /><br />It looks like the connection is being closed before the GET has any chance to return the data I guess... Weird though, It only happens when multiple tabs are loading at the same time. <br /><br />An example it I&#039;m on the forum page with the list of topics, I ctrl click the topics I view most often *5 tabs* and only the original one I was on loads.. the rest show all 502&#039;s.. <br /><br />I was trying to do what the help thing says and adjust the timeout values, but I&#039;m new to linux and I cant find the configuration file or even Epiphany&#039;s directory... <br /><br />When I try and load the same pages through my normal lappy through firefox with Tor enabled they load up with no errors.. <br /><br />Also is it normal that browsing through liberte is a lot slower than browsing through firefor with TOR enabled? Or have I fucked a config up somewhere<br /><br />Thanks guys<br />ACE

				Yes browsing using Liberte is slower than using the Tor Browser Bundle. And using multiple tabs will slow it down even more. You can edit the configuration files but they are already optimized and unless you really know what you are doing you may easily make it worse. Best leave it as it is. You have to remember that there is an awful lot that has been put on Liberte, it has a fully working linux sytem, albeit stripped down but that is the price you are paying for all the anonymity, encrypted volume, a GUI PGP etc and all on a removable USB memory stick.
