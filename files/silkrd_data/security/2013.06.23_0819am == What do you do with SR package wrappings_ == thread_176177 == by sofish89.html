				After you receive SR packages, is it a good idea to shred the envelopes or throw them in an abandoned dumpster far away from where you live?<br />What do you guys do with your packages?<br />Is it a good idea to destroy them or dispose of them far away from your drop address??

				I just destroy the label and put the rest in the trash. It&#039;s a better Idea to dispose of it away from your home but the most important part is the label and return address IMO.

				I have always had them shredded because of a thread like this one that let&#039;s you know how important it is.&nbsp; <br />Though the label is important so too is the rest of the packing. It has been reported that tracking devices can be installed in them. I have also read where cameras could also be used. Just imagine with the rapid advancements in technology the things that could be done.&nbsp; Not that they are being done, but you can never be to careful.&nbsp; Be safe with this journey, ;)

				I burn it all shortly after unpacking. Partially that&#039;s because with cannabis the inner bags, well, smell like cannabis, so I don&#039;t want that attracting attention in the garbage. Plus right, I want to be sure to properly dispose of the address labels and to a degree the stealth that was used to prevent anyone from getting hip to it.

				Yeah I was actually just tossing mine in a drawer at first until like a user posted above I came across a thread like this one and realized how stupid I was being. if all hell did break loose I def couldnt claim I never ordered it or at the very least that it was my first time or what ever the reasoning its not smart to keep em.<br />after collecting them all up I had a grocery bag packed full of packaging and vac seal&nbsp; wrappings and such. so I burnt it all and now burn it right away with other paper or yard waste.&nbsp; For sure the best idea. something feels soo good about completely getting rid of every trace of something that you DO NOT WANT and can cost you your freedom or at least help to. (and you want to keep that list as short as possible when you are already forced to break the law daily because of our fucked laws)

				I keep a small &quot;burn can&quot; on my porch, or at the edge of my driveway. The most important part(in my opinion) is the actual &quot;USPS&quot; packaging, which is all that incriminates you, essentially. I immediately open the pack, toss the packaging in the can, usually stuff a paper towel or similar paper inside the box/envelope, and light it up. Within 2-3 mins all evidence is GONE. You can even use charcoal lighter fluid if you really want to be able to destroy it even faster.

				I am not in a position to be able to inconspicuously burn the whole thing (except thur durgz - duh!).&nbsp; That is clearly ideal.<br /><br />Previously I have separated the elements of the packaging, surrounded them with other gross garbage, and thrown them in with a bunch of other peoples&#039; garbage in a small bag that has nothing else from my residence included.<br /><br />Shredding or burning the shipping label should probably be considered bare minimum best practice.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				How do you remove with fire so it&#039;s inconspicuous?&nbsp; If you live in the city and walk outside with a metal bin, lighter fluid, and set the shit on fire, that is going to draw attention.&nbsp; Likewise, if you drive to a public area (or abandoned) area within the city and do the same thing, will also draw attention.&nbsp; Plus there are cameras EVERYWHERE.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just being paranoid (I&#039;d say cautious), but does anyone have any other useful suggestions?<br /><br />Labels are easy to dispose of with a shredder or water, but you still have the outside packaging they were shipped in, and the various stealth methods used to dispose of.
