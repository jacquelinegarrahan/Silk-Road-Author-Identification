				Sup<br /><br />Been looking into this for awhile here s what I ve found so far.<br /><br />Intersango has a Metro bank account which I could feasibly put cash into, but they only have branches in London for the cost of what i am doing its not worth the expense of getting there.<br /><br />Mt Gox has a Barclays Bank Account, went today and the teller told me its not valid.&nbsp; Re checked the details i had written down and they were as they appear on the Mt Gox site, lost all faith in dealing with them as this seems highly unprofessional and a bit shady.<br /><br />Ukash to bitcoins seems like scammer heaven, all google searches i ve done have led me to just scam artists and the few reputable money changers on here have said they wont do it, which tbh I can understand.<br /><br />I appreciate that the bitcoin encryption is meant to be solid etc but I am not enjoying whacking unaccounted cash into my bank then transferring that day and repeating week after week.<br /><br />Anyone got a good method for doing what it says in the title, namely ANONYMOUSLY getting physical £&#039;s to bitcoins?<br /><br />PS for any scammers browsing this I wont be going to any shady reagnn.nl or whatever it is and giving you Ukash numbers so gtfo.<br /><br />All help much appreciated.

				hi<br />forget cash/metro/intersango as metro no longer accept cash deposits for intersango,you could get a mate to do a wire transfer to your sango account and then trade for coins with them,dont know why but that has just changed recently,,that was my method for getting coins,i now use mtgox,i cant understand why the cashier said what they did,mt gox barclays details&nbsp; TIBANNE LTD-s/c 20-35-90 acc 63508234 are these the same details you gave ? also you must make sure you put the reference number in ,which is something like MTG 6 numbers and an x at the end,,the 6 numbers are your personal mtgox acc number,remember its not illegal to buy coins,if they start giving you shit at the bank give it back to them,,they wouldnt have a fucking job if people like us never used there bank,simples<br />also remeber NEVER ACCESS MTGOX USING TOR WEB BROWSER,i found this out recently and got blocked,they lifted it eventually<br />barring the above two methods i dont personally know any other way well enough to tell you,but search these forums and theres loads of info regarding £-btc<br />hope i helped you

				Cheers for the reply mate, yea definetly same bank details that you have.&nbsp; and yea made sure had my &quot;message&quot; or reference for my Mt Gox account to add to it.<br /><br />When did u last deposit into barclays with them?<br /><br />The teller never gave me any shit just said it was not valid details, assume if you ve deposited recently then its just I ve dealt with a tard in Barclays.<br /><br />I emailed Mt Gox anyway and I ll update when I hear back from them.&nbsp; fwiw I just used a bank transfer to intersango and it went thru fine and quicker than previously.<br /><br />

				Just a quick update Mt Gox got back to me and confirmed that the details for their barclays account as displayed on their website in the &quot;funding options&quot; &gt; &quot;Bank Deposit UK&quot; are correct.<br /><br />I dealt with a teller who was a moron and even after double checking with me obv cant read as the details I gave were correct.<br /><br />My apologies to Mt Gox also for critiscing them they also got back to my ameil within 2 hours.<br /><br />cheers
