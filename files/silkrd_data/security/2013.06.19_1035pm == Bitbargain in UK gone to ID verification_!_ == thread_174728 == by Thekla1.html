				Just to update this, i know someone who has used this in the past 24 hours and it worked problem free, all it said on his screen was that there were 2 Bitcoin vendors he was unable to choose as they required verified accounts to make an order.

But there are still offers there that appear available.<br /><br />Maybe get a temp PAYG sim card and register the number see if that works.<br /><br />

				Oh dear. I can still log on to it without verifying my ID or phone number. It does tell me I&#039;m missing out on offers because I&#039;m not verified, which I think is balls.

But I have ever only verified my phone and it works just fine. You just see that their were more offers had you had your accounts (bank and/or address) verified.

				I logged in earlier and I didn&#039;t see anything like that, been wanting to buy coins since yesterday but there is no way I was paying even the cheapest offer on bitbargain. Thanks for reminding me of local bitcoins, works in the same way as bit bargain but a lot cheaper at the moment.

				I had a nightmare with my vendor! Stacked up my wallet with BTC, went to withdraw to my SR account but was told that I needed e-mail confirmation. New security rule apparently. Thing is, e-mail I used when registering with them has been disabled for lack of activity. Therefore, I was asked to verify my account using personal ID and residence evidence. I have to do it because there is a large amount of BTC in the account, but so much for the anonymity!!! Nightmare!!!!!!
