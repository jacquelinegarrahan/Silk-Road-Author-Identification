Bitcoin up.<br />March 13, 2012, 08:33:36 PM&nbsp;#11<br /><br />_________________________________________I see little chance of a larger correction to gold price unless the economy starts a miraculous recovery, which I don&#039;t believe in. Peak oil is still the most relevant problem that probably won&#039;t go away easily, next&nbsp;*decade*&nbsp;the earliest. Energy is the backbone of the whole economy and the gradually and slowly rising energy prices are a major source of friction in the economy causing everyone to take on more debt. Players in the economy are desperately trying to sustain growth while fundamentally there can be no growth because the energy to support that growth is&nbsp;*simply not there*.<br /><br />Thus the problem is much deeper than many realize, in the current situation every time the economy &quot;recovers&quot; oil demand spikes and then oil prices spike causing another major crash. In fact the crashes get bigger every time, with the world being still so dependent on oil. I expect that what we saw in 2008 will be small once we hit the next cycle.<br /><br />I expect the economy to do a larger fake recovery soon, but then we will go much deeper than in 2008. Simply because not enough has been done to reduce dependency on scarce resources such as oil. Global oil production hasn&#039;t increased since 2005 most likely, yet demand keeps going up thanks to China and other growing economies.<br /><br />Gold bugs know all of this and will certainly feel more safe with gold than USD. Even though I&#039;m quite bullish on Bitcoin long term, I still hold significantly more value in gold than in bitcoins. This could change but slowly, over a period of many years. Once I feel more confident about the economy and the state of Bitcoin I might consider changing more gold into bitcoins.

				I just seriously looked at the prices of some products on the silk road a moment ago and was shocked at how overpriced LSD is. Like, over 20 dollars per blotter on average.

				I wonder how strongly the volume of sales on Silk Road effects bitcoin value.&nbsp; I think the first strong spike in bitcoin value happened around the time of the first famous Gawker article about Silk Road, and that makes me wonder if Silk Road is a principal driver of bitcoin value.

With all this bitcoin rise, people should appreciate the growth. I`m happy that its value has gone up. Lol, the number of coins produced have nothing to do with the appreciation of the bitcoin market. The goal number is so far away, 21 million bitcoins is about 160 million dollars (USD) and the bitcoin market will grow and evolve to keep going once it has passed that goal.
