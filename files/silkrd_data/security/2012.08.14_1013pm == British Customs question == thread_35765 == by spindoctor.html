				If a small amount of class A is found by UK customs, what should I expect? I have images of 30 suited and booted officers breaking my door down for a gram of MD or coke etc. I have no idea whether they have found anything, just a package no show, and was wondering what may happen.

				i don&#039;t think they do love letters in the UK mate, i had a big envelope full of shrooms winging its way back to my home address when i visited Amsterdam that never showed up - didn&#039;t hear anything about it. i imagine it would be the same for any obviously personal amounts of anything - they aren&#039;t going to waste valuable police time just to tell a tweaker &#039;stop being naughty&#039; ,they&#039;ll just dispose of it

				Thanks mate. That makes me feel a little better. I suppose I just needed to hear from others who have packages that have &#039;gone missing&#039;. There&#039;s nothing to say the vendor screwed up as well though. Or just didn&#039;t send.

				Plus there&#039;s no way they can prove you actually ordered it. Deny all knowledge of the package and you&#039;re fine. Plus, like the guy above me said it&#039;d be a waste of police time to come and arrest an end consumer like you with such a small amount. They&#039;ll just dispose of it.

				I&#039;ve had lost international orders. They just don&#039;t turn up, nothing ever happened. Don&#039;t know of anyone that&#039;s received a customs letter in the UK, would like to hear from anyone who has. The only time I got a customs letter was when I ordered something on ebay from China and they wanted to charge me import duty!<br /><br />For a large quantity would be risky but also stupid, stick to small orders and its &#039;unlikely&#039; anything will happen IMO.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s the legal and logistical reasons why it would be a waste of time and money for the police to do anything. The cost of doing a controlled delivery and surveillance outweighs what might get them a prosecution.<br /><br />I&#039;d imagine it happens all the time, they probably just destroy it or pocket it for themselves.

				Yes they do do love-letters in the U.K. They are called notices of seizure.
