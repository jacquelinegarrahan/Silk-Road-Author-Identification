				i&#039;m thinking of goin with Aurumxchange to buy my bitcoins, using their new feature cash deposit, and picking a bank thats quite a distance from my home town. Dont want a Mtgox voucher since apparently u cant use tor with them unless u want your account locked. Does anyone know if using tor on bitcoinica or btc-e is safe? and if anyone used aurumxchange before this way, can you comment on their service and speed? thanks a lot.<br /><br />P.S. not related, but is the pecunix fee of 0.5% covered when buying pecunix from them?

				Screw all that nonsense, if you don&#039;t mind me saying.<br /><br />Use Get-Bitcoin. I probably sound like a customer service rep or something when telling people about them but they&#039;re pretty fucking great.<br />They charge 5% on buying BTC, 3% selling it. And if you don&#039;t get your BTC in 24 hours after sending them the receipt of payment, their services are fee free. Oh, and they do cash deposits at Chase and BofA.<br />You can use their site through TOR and give a different name/anonymous email when ordering and that&#039;s all the information they&#039;ll ask for. Cash deposits require no ID, no nothing, just money.<br />Sorry I didn&#039;t answer your questions, but just saying, there&#039;s almost always a simpler way to do something.

				Remember it&#039;s not illegal or suspicious to buy bitcoins. It&#039;s what you do with those coins afterwards that makes you anonymous, just move them around a few addresses to create some plausible deniability in blockexplorer and good to go. If anybody asks you sold them to somebody, no way to prove you didn&#039;t especially if it was a cash based transaction on the street or by mail.<br /><br />If really, really worried after every transaction and your balance is 0 truecrypt wallet.dat, wipe it from your hard drive and start up bitcoin-qt and make a new wallet.dat again. Now no transaction history kept locally
