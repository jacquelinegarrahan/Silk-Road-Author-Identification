				We should have a topic as a community about horror stories.&nbsp; no, not campfire ghost stories or even stories about shitty sellers or shitty customers.<br /><br />This thread should be about online sellers that people know who have gotten busted by LE.&nbsp; How did it happen?&nbsp; What were the mistakes they made?&nbsp; What sort of evidence was brought against them, etc.<br /><br />The reason I post this is because BCBudman apparently just got pinched by the legalists.&nbsp; He is in my country.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to know how he got caught.&nbsp; I want to know what mistakes he made so myself and others aren&#039;t making them too.<br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t have any of my own because I am one of these type of sellers:&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any friends that do my product, my customers are all just acquaintances who don&#039;t even know my real name.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even use my own product regularly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have friends in the business, just a couple of long-term contacts who operate the same way.&nbsp; Everyone keeps their distance, nobody talks outside of business, and our meetings are brief and professional.&nbsp; I dont&#039; know anyone who has been busted because I know what a reckless dealer is from a hundred miles away and I keep my distance - I lead a pretty quiet life.&nbsp; Work, the typical middle class setup, all of that.<br /><br />Anyway, I just thought this is a very pertinent issue in light of a couple of recent seller busts from SR (I&#039;m not sure if it was SR related or they were doing sloppy f2f business, but that&#039;s one of the things I really want to find out).<br /><br />Let&#039;s keep this topic going so we can all learn a valuable lesson without getting kidnapped and locked in a cage by a bunch of fucking sadists who would actually take a paycheck to do that kind of shit.........

				Well, I don&#039;t know about online sellers, but in &quot;real&quot; life it is 90% sloppiness on the part of the dealer.&nbsp; The best set up is a middle class lifestyle without paper trails.&nbsp; You have to look completely different than a drug dealer &quot;looks&quot;.&nbsp; This is pretty much common sense for everyone here, I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; It would probably stand to reason the best way not to get caught is to have a healthy paranoia, think of possible scenario&#039;s before they happen, and try to pre correct any mistakes.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m sure there is a way to do it and eventually retire.

				I&#039;m ten years in and not a dent so far.&nbsp; But I think I get more paranoid as I go along because I have more to lose... so it helps me.<br /><br />But I am new to online selling, and even though I approach it with the same safety/security levels as I do f2f life, I am wondering what has caused others to be taken out.

				Mostly, it&#039;s letting one&#039;s guard down, telling the wrong person, getting caught in a stupid way.&nbsp; How often do you read of people who get caught speeding or running a red light, then turns out they were carrying a whole lot of dope.&nbsp; But the world I used to live in, it was either that, or somebody *else* getting caught, and ratting you out...it was never great detective work...we weren&#039;t big enough to warrant that.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s why I always tell people on here that sometimes we put too much time into the crytpo-digital problems, when usually if we get nailed it&#039;ll be because we just *had* to tell our homies about this great new way to get dope online...then one of the homies get popped, decides to give you up.&nbsp; Only time will tell.&nbsp; I&#039;m as susceptible as the next guy: I like to be friendly, talk, I&#039;m not always careful...so this has been a tough one: just got to keep it to myself, and hard as it is, I can&#039;t make friends with sellers, for their safety, and so if they *do* get in trouble, they&#039;ll know it wasn&#039;t me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I even turned off pm&#039;s for a while...just got to keep it private, nothing personal, but the less you know about me, and I know about you, the better off we&#039;ll all be...I know many of you with good intentions kind of want to eliminate &#039;the middleman.&#039;&nbsp; I got no quarrel with that...but I like the middleman...the middleman keeps me safe and happy.<br /><br />I love SR, like helping out here, want it to prosper.&nbsp; Got no complaints about the system, and have a few great sellers I get along fine with...

				BCBudMan was a solid seller. Could have went far here too, super top notch stuff and really responsive. I honestly feel for him.&nbsp; At least it was canada and not the states but still...makes me even more noided out which is probably a good thing. <br /><br />I wonder if it was related to SR at all&nbsp; they seized his puter so I hear but that could have just been taken as part of the normal evidence collection of the raid.&nbsp;

				On opiophile a girl was warning us away from SR, saying she had got busted in some kind of Tor setup, and how dangerous it was...but after reading her posts, well-meaning tho they were, it seemed she was meeting with somebody F2F, which is way different.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here we don&#039;t meet, and have no reason to share info.&nbsp; And no way to link us that is valid.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know on BCBudman.&nbsp; But so far all the stories, when somebody gets nailed, it&#039;s always through just plain old fashioned stuff...never any high-tech gadgetry or network analysis.&nbsp; I doubt they can justify the expense, when who knows where most of us live, anyway...with all the seriously dangerous international terror and arms sales going on in the world, I doubt they get all that excited about a few lightweight drug transactions...but one should be careful anyway...you never know...

				I just caught some information that indicated he was growing, packaging, and shipping on site, and did not have even a power-bypass for his hydroponics system (unless there was solar power or something else that wasn&#039;t mentioned.)<br /><br />Bloody rough, this life can be.
