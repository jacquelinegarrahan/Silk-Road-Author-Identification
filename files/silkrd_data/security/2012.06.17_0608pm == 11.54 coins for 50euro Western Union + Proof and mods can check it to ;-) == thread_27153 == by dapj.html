You just admitted it!<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with this guy...He wanted me to explain to him how to do a western union&nbsp; transaction and he wants to mock my 4 posts on my throw away account. What a dope.<br /><br />And yes whenever you sell 63 coins or are talking about trying to get it up to 75 BTC I recommend a throw away account.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Show the pm&#039;s to the community of me!!.....&quot;The best part is when I said I need 75 coin for my purchase or I need to sell all 63 coins he goes I will buy them! Send them first!&quot; This pm, show that i asked that! But you can&#039;t because then people will see you are luying as hell! Here in the community if you call names to someone and claime things then you have to prove it! But you can&#039;t because you know i never asked or said that sentence otherwise you also will publish my pm&#039;s like i did with yours. Members have the right to defend themselves if they are being called a liar and you trie to make somebody like a liar or scammer! Ow yeah and now you are with BTCbuddy or something like that...but wasn&#039;t he bitchy or so???? Your words.<br />...............<br />Serious people my offer still counts ;)<br />Ps : If a mod read this can you please publish my pm&#039;s that i have written to the user gambler?? Thx in advance&nbsp; ;)

				I have the wright to defend myself if somebody claimes that i have done/ said something which is not true....that is asked to buy your coins and that you had to send them to me first. Then yeah i have the wrught to defend my reputation by putting our pm&#039;s in public to show i didn&#039;t ask that + that makes me a liar otherwise. You have also the right to defend yourself when you experience one day the same thing with another member that is making you look like a liar or scammer, then you must also use the evidence to defend yourself so the community then knows the truth. And i don&#039;t know if that Daq person was you but if it is so then that is sooo looooowww under the belt! So i know that mods can see that i was the whole time online on my profile + their are also trolls that like to make new accounts and start commotion in a topic, i have see that i many topics. So i hope they gone close this topic now.<br />Have a nice day everybody!<br />Greettzz
