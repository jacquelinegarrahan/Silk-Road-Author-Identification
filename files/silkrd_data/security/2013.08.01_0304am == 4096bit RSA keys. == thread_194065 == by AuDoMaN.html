				I&#039;ve been using SR for almost a year now and It occurred to me that most vendors use a 2048bit RSA key. I&#039;ve only seen one using 4096.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m used to using the command line GPG and It allows me to make keys up to 4096bit. You can make even larger ones but they are not compatible with some GPG UI software. <br /><br />It seems with all this stuff about the NSA and data collection recently maybe vendors should start using larger key sizes? Is there some reason we are not using the strongest encryption available to us? <br /><br />It&#039;s not the vendors data being encrypted against the 2048bit key, it&#039;s mine, and I would feel better encrypting against larger keys. Should this become a standard?<br /><br />What are your thoughts?

				There&#039;s no reason why most people use 2048 bit keys other than that&#039;s the default in a lot of PGP programs. On the other hand, 2048 bit keys should be safe for another 20 years, so it doesn&#039;t really matter. 1024 bit keys are considered weak because they will be crackable in a reasonable amount of time (100 days or so) with computer clusters within the next 5 years, so you might want to avoid vendors with 1024 bit or smaller keys, but there&#039;s nothing wrong with 2048 bit keys.

				There&#039;s probably only 20 or so vendors using 4096bit RSA/RSA keys. <br /><br />Jack&#039;s one. We&#039;re one. Ballervision is another. Modwiz, Pharmington Rex, XXXoxtica, and a few others I can&#039;t remember offhand. I saw a lot of 1024bit keys out there though. I would think that that would be the majority keys, then comes 2048bit. Might even be some 512bit keys out there. <br /><br />

				Yeah, when I imported 1020 vendor keys, I added up the different key sizes. At the time there was one vendor with an 8192 bit key, DrCol, but since then I think there has been one other vendor with a key that big, but I don&#039;t know his name. I forgot how many 4096 bit keys there were, but the vast majority were 2048 bit, then maybe 50 1024 bit keys, and 10 or so 512 bit keys. You can crack a 512 bit key in no time. Most of those vendors are using BCPG, where it is the default for some retarded reason.<br />

				There&#039;s a statute of limitation in most jurisdictions to prosecute drug trafficking related crimes of this sort. Varies from maybe 5 to 7 years depending on state/federal/country. After that, it can&#039;t be pursued. Minor variances in the definition of the limitation (like when LE should have known) that might extend that a few months or so. Sending around PGP messages of just addresses doesn&#039;t constitute evidence other than you or someone is sending around PGP messages with your address. LE has to prove that you took possession and/or paid for the drugs. Lots of little dots in between that frustrate the whole thing. They like getting tips and making busts with drugs, cash, paraphernalia, weapons, cell phones, lists... tangible stuff a D/A can present before a grand jury or judge and make a simple narrative before a jury given all this evidence. <br /><br />You PGP&#039;ing around messages yet nothing directly connected to those messages has no value to a prosecutor of LE in a western world country.

				If you killed someone and wrote the confession in a PGP encrypted message, then they&#039;ll care about decrypting it in 20 years, otherwise they won&#039;t care about petty drug transactions you made 20 years earlier. They&#039;ll be busy solving the crimes of the 2030s.<br />

				@ JasonBourne. <br /><br />Two things. <br /><br />1. Yep, yep, and yep except my only concern is drug trafficing. It&#039;s an issue close to my heart. LOL. But I like Astor&#039;s comment about PGP&#039;ing a confession to murder. A crime which has no statute of limitation. (I see what you did there).<br /><br />2. Laws do evolve. But in the West, there&#039;s a concept of grandfathering. Meaning, for example, let&#039;s say that in Jan 2020 they now say that the statute of limitation to prosecute drug related crimes is 10 years. That means drug related crimes committed after the new statute goes into effect can be prosecuted with evidence gathered for 10 years before bringing it before a grand jury/judge. The evidence for crimes started in 2013 would be inadmissible under the new statute of limitation law since the old statute of limitation was 5 years. And in 2026, the evidence for drug related crimes would be inadmissible for crimes committed in Dec 2019 because they were still covered under the old statute of limitation. <br /><br />For a prosecutor to push the limits of the statute, you&#039;d have to be a heavy hitter and a near slam dunk worth attempting to set precedent over. AKA, High profile.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And what Tree says above. GPG4USB does 4096+ RSA/RSA

				Many of the top 10% vendors have weak keys. <br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First, PGP tends to be over weighted as a security measure. It&#039;s obsessed over by some. It seems to be so by those who are purely buyers and aren&#039;t thinking about all the steps involved in vending. <br /><br />The truth of the matter is, PGP is a best practice against one particular vector of attack: SR is completely infiltrated by LEO. But consider that way less that half of all SR buyers use PGP. The overwhelming majority use clear text/privnote. Low hanging fruit is LEO&#039;s favorite. If they can get 1000 buyers using clear-text, they might not bother wasting time on the 200 using PGP of any strength. The mere fact of making arrests of low hanging fruit is enough to create FUD and render SR inoperable. LEO is not going to waste the expense of brute-force decyrpting a small percentage of buyers using PGP when they can net hundreds not using PGP for free. Politicians eager to put that feather in their cap wouldn&#039;t allow LEO to be patient once they learned that they got a foothold in SR. <br /><br />Also think about this; a vendor has to decrypt your address, then copy and paste your address into some kind of label making software. So now we have your address in clipboard memory and label making software allocated memory. And for vendors that process multiple orders per day, they would have several sheets of addresses printed out before adhering them to their respective packages. It&#039;s going to be more efficient doing it that way instead of doing one at a time. <br /><br />If a vendor gets raided or apprehended between the points where your address is decrypted to the point of your address being on a package about to be dropped to the postal system, your name and address has been compromised. Your PGP efforts rendered moot. <br /><br />This is what I mean about over weighting the importance of PGP. It&#039;s important. But don&#039;t rely on it for protection. Concentrate more on plausible deniability. You should have your game plan down to the point that you would chuckle when accusation is brought against you. Assuming it *could* be brought against you. <br /><br />PGP isn&#039;t plausible deniability. It&#039;s just running interference.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Let me see if I have karma left.<br /><br />Paece out <br />Jason&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Assuming US federal law since we&#039;re talking importation, if they had 21 years of evidence strictly related to narcotic importation and no other crime (like murder, or conspiracy to commit it) associated with it, their look back period would be limited to 5 years (the statute) from the time in which they levy charges against whatever defendants. But sitting on evidence for 21 years would be a problem for the state&#039;s case. Technically, they should have pursued the charges 16 years ago given that they have evidence going back 21 years from the time in which charges are filed. The only way around that is to prove that they (the state) only came upon this evidence which points to 21 years of activity, at most 5 years ago. There can be no logs or chains of evidence of any kind that contradicts that. <br /><br />If there were any principals in this enterprise that got out of it say 7 years ago, they cannot be prosecuted for crimes covered under the statute. They can be compelled to testify to establish character of those defendants being charged and to corroborate certain aspects of the evidence. If there were any murders during this 21 years of operation, then that 5 year look back does not apply since there&#039;s no statute of limitations on murder.&nbsp; Everyone involved can technically be charged with conspiracy to commit murder or aiding and abetting of some kind. The smart criminals never get involved with that kind of nasty business.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s why detectives and investigators, given this time limitation statute, work hard and fast and want slam dunks. Time is money. Money is limited. So they want one of three things; the big score or many mid levels scores or a dragnet&#039;s worth of low hanging fruit. The latter is a last resort. LEO seems to have a &quot;cutoff the head of the snake&quot; mentality. Mostly a view held by those who get to take credit before the media for busts. They just love their press conferences.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, let&#039;s take &quot;the Farmer&#039;s Market&quot; as an example. About 15 people were arrested on 2012. The evidence presented was from 2007 to 2009. But they started in 2005/2006. But because of the time of the arrests, the look back max was 2007. They also had evidence of hundreds of buyers. But they charged only principals and top suppliers. Basically they followed the money. Some buyers were caught up in it but were used as snitches and were probably given immunity. <br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Statute of limitation for conspiracy (act of furthering a criminal enterprise) - 5 years in most US jurisdictions. Clock starts at last act in furtherance. So if you withdrew from &quot;the biz&quot; 6 years ago (last act) and LEO tries to bring charges now because they finally got around to decrypting your PGPs (or compelling you to divulge the passphrase)... too late for them. :) <br /><br /><br />Edit: +karma :)

				Wow, damn Astor!<br /><br />Will a key like that work in all PGP software out there? <br /><br />At 4096bit, I got a few buyers who said it wasn&#039;t importing. And sho&#039; nuff, they didn&#039;t know which program they were using. So I guess it might have been user error. Code ID10T.

				No, it won&#039;t work with any vanilla PGP programs that I know of. Even gpg has to be modified. I also did some benchmarks in a later post. It takes 34 times as long to decrypt a message that is encrypted with a 16K key compared to a 4K, so there&#039;s a noticeable 2+ second lag.<br /><br />It is totally impractical, but I still have it as a novelty.<br />
