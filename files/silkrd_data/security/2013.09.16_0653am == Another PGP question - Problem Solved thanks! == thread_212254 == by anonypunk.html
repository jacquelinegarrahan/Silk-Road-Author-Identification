				I have never sent my address unencrypted to a vendor for obvious reasons. I have an order that is being held up by a vendor who cannot understand how to use it properly. He tried to give me his PGP key and I got a PGP message instead. I&#039;ve explained it as best I can and even sent him Pine&#039;s link. <br /><br />I am wondering how dangerous it actually is to send my address unencrypted (since I don&#039;t have his public key) via the message system on SR and also in the address box when I place my order. I have read that they are deleted as soon as the item is marked in transit but how common are man in the middle attacks? This is bugging me b/c like I said I&#039;ve got an order that&#039;s being held up and it&#039;s a great deal too! Awesomely nice vendor but I have a hard time trusting people who won&#039;t take the steps to be safe. Any help here?

				It really depends on the vendor mate. Remember BlueGiraffe? That&#039;s an example of how encryption still doesn&#039;t matter as it still ultimately has to be decrypted.

				I don&#039;t think MITM attacks are possible with hidden services, unless the Silk Road server got hacked.<br />Though if a vendor doesn&#039;t understand how to use PGP they may have other deficiencies which makes them insecure, because they don&#039;t understand the dangers they are facing. So they can get busted more easily.

				Yeah I feel the same way Bazille. He said he&#039;s using gpg4usb and I have never used that before but was under the impression that it is the same as gpg4win basically. What&#039;s the best and most simple tutorial you&#039;ve seen? Could you link to it or give your own advice? I think that too much info could make it confusing for him.

				Here&#039;s a simple GPG4USB tutorial: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206998.msg1487769#msg1487769<br /><br />But if this guy is having so many trouble with PGP, you have to wonder how much his other security practices suck.<br />

				Hey thanks Astor! I&#039;ll send that link to him and hop for the best. If not I just won&#039;t place the order. <br /><br />It pretty much sucks though b/c its a custom listing at a great fucking price. Which also makes me nervous but new vendors are usually pretty cool.
