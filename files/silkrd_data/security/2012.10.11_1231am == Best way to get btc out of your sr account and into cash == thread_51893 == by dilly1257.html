				bro do not use mt gox!!!!! there is tooo much bs.. transfer them to a paypal account from there eaither send them to a prepaid card or other opyions,&nbsp; cashin bitcoins or buying them isnt illegal, they wont know where your coins came from...look up all your opions, ask oothers vendors for advice, just dont use mt gox tooo many issues there these days..u r gonna need to set up a wallet to send the SR coins to, Blockchain gives you a free wallet, they r awsome
