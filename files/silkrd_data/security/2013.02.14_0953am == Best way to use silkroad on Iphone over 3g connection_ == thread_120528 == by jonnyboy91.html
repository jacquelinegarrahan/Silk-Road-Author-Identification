				Should be avoided at all costs.<br /><br />Quite a vulnerability is created that way. <br /><br />Don&#039;t take it from me, research further. <br /><br />I was doing this last summer, and was chastised from people pretty high up, not just on SR, but on TOR. <br /><br />Keep it on a secure computer. Better yet on a flash drive. <br /><br />There&#039;s no such thing as being too careful on here. Although there seems to be a new crop, that is very brazen, and will ruin it for the rest of us. <br /><br />I just ask that you research further before you proceed. Sure it works. That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s advisable. <br /><br />Smart phones are the most hackable computers made. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />

The last time I used that app was about four months ago. It was okay, it did the job, but sometimes would fuck up and you weren&#039;t able to multitask while using the app, otherwise you would have to reboot the Tor connection. Like I said though, that was four months ago. The developer has updated it, so I&#039;m not sure how much better (or worse) it is.<br /><br />You could just use the .to proxy, but I wouldn&#039;t use it for anything more than browsing on a throw away account. According to the SR forums, it&#039;s not a secure proxy at all.
