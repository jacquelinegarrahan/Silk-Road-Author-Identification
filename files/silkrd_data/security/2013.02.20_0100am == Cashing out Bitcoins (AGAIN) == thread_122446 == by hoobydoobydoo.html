				So I have just been reading post after post on these forums with users asking the simple question - How do I convert my Bitcoins back into cash anonymously?&nbsp; And in every one I have read so far it seems like these questions continue to go unanswered.<br /><br />Mescaline has been in high demand here on SR and I have waffled back and forth about trying to bring some to the road.&nbsp; I now have an old friend interested in performing the extractions on his own and handling the shipping.&nbsp; I don&#039;t personally want to be very involved in the process from a risk perspective but I am happy to help him get started and handle the online identity piece for him.&nbsp; I believe I have everything mapped out for him to be successful except for this piece.<br /><br />The two methods that I have seen mentioned are obtaining an anonymous bank account with a credit card, or selling the bitcoins to users on SR for Moneypak or WU transfers.&nbsp; The credit card method is not ideal since it isn&#039;t cash.&nbsp; And the WU method spooks me a little bit just because of the cameras.<br /><br />I know there have to be other methods that some of the vendors on here are using due to the volume they are moving but I just don&#039;t know what.&nbsp; If you guys don&#039;t want to post publicly can someone send me a PM with ideas?<br /><br />Thanks.

				You will not get this information for free. Nobody with a solid technique will ever publish it on an open anonymous forum (which LE monitor regularly) or it will render that technique useless.<br /><br />People to PM on this forum are : Limetless, Jesusofrave &amp; EnterTheMatrix. These are the three that i&#039;m pretty sure may help you out for a (high) price.<br /><br />Don&#039;t quote me on that though, they may have changed their mind.

				oh yeah, someone will sell you a bridge. <br /><br />bitcopia.com, bitcoin-to-cash.com, localbitcoins.com<br /><br />or buy gold, sell gold. <br /><br />this isnt rocket science.

				agreeing with what dude said above, PM&#039;ing to find the right guy. I&#039;ve heard of cash in the mail for like 25% fee but thats a reasonable amount considering the service they are providing. thousands of dollars in cash overnight.<br /><br />&nbsp;if i was a vendor i wouldnt mind paying the 25% fee, especially since if i let the btc sit it will grow plenty to where the 25% made itself.
