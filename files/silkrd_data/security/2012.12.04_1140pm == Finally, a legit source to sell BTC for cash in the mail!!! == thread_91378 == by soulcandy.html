				I just want to give a shout out to my man at Bitcopia.com for providing a legit service I&#039;ve been trying to find for a long time. I was nervous cause I sent like $995 worth of bitcoins my first time cause it&#039;s like $30 for overnight mail so I wanted to get my money&#039;s worth. But my cash was at my door the next day!!! I go through like $4000 a week in BTC and was doing pretty stupid things to turn them into cash, but this is the easiest and least stupid way I have found. He told me his sell order volume was low and to spread the word, so here it is. Check out www.bitcopia.com.

				I only use bitcopia now. The mark up is 60 cents a bitcoin so 20 bitcoins comes with a $12 fee.
