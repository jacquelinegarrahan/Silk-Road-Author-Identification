				I use a reputable Canadian Bitcoin exchange but a transfer of coins to my Bitcoin Wallet never made it there. I contacted the dealer and the response was to look up the transaction number in the block explorer. I&#039;m not sure exactly what this means; there is no block explorer on the exchange site and I am finding it difficult to clarify this using google. I also don&#039;t know what I am to do with this information once I have found it. So I didn&#039;t find the response from the dealer very helpful, and they did not send me further information, but maybe I am missing something simple.&nbsp; Advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Do you have a transaction ID? If not, you should check the source and destination addresses on blockchain.info, see if there are unconfirmed transactions waiting to be processed by the network.

				Hello,<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: cossette</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I contacted the dealer and the response was to look up the transaction number in the block explorer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your dealer means to use the block explorer website (blockchain.info) to look up the tx number.&nbsp; They have a search function.&nbsp; He should have provided you with that number either in an email or during the purchasing process.&nbsp; Once you look up the transaction number, you&#039;ll be able to determine if your bitcoins have actually made it to the receive address (or some other address, if you made a mistake and gave the wrong one).<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason to panic just yet, mind you.&nbsp; It could be that your wallet hasn&#039;t finished syncing with the bitcoin network yet.&nbsp; If you&#039;re using the bitcoin-qt client (the &#039;official&#039; wallet), this process can take a day or so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had it take less than 30 hours on a machine with an encrypted disk.&nbsp; Unencrypted would likely take less time.<br /><br />Incidentally, when I was trying to figure out what way would be best to get bitcoins, I tried a few different services with small amounts of money each time.&nbsp; Less risk that way.
