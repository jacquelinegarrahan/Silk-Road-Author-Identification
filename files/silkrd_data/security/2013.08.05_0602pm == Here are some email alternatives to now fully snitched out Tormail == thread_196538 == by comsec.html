				Besides making your own/buying your own Domain + email (can easily do this with Namecoin, or KatzGlobal, or any Iceland VPS provider like 1984hosting)<br /><br />https://bitmessage.ch/ - has a .onion server, this forwards emails into bitmessage p2p network. Obviously use PGP. Give customers the email address it generates, and then they can mail you and it will be on the network for retrieval with regular bitmessage client (torify!) or retrieve it from them over .onion access. Bitmessage is highly experimental and flaws galore have been found in it, keep that in mind while using it. <br /><br />I2p-Bote mail - is similar to bitmessage in that it&#039;s p2p/decentralized and doesn&#039;t expose headers like who the message has been sent to. Pretty sure Tails includes this in it&#039;s I2p panel (if they still have i2p)<br /><br />https://privatdemail.net - has a self-signed cert, so at anytime can be MITM attacked. SSL/TLS is totally broken anyways. Always use PGP<br /><br />http://security.resist.ca/create-nym.shtml&nbsp; Classic Nym address. It would be preferred to use a newsgroup in your reply block, like alt.anonymous.messages then retrieve your messages by downloading all of them on either a bitcoin VPS, or through a premium newsgroup service that offers https encrypted retrieval. This is as anonymous as you could get before bitmessages and i2p-bote mail. Always use PGP of course. <br /><br />https://www.cotse.net/cgi-bin/mixmail.cgi for sending emails through a mixmaster. They also offer an email service, prob not suitable for business but they strip outgoing IP.<br /><br />Jabber - only use Jabber with a .onion address. You can make your own:<br />https://www.torservers.net/wiki/setup/jabber<br /><br />Countermail - risky, your account could be yoinked if some idiot rats you out with enough complaints. Hide it behind your domain name: https://countermail.com/?p=support#48 so register a bitcoin domain, then read their FAQ how to set it up. Has at least basic MITM attack prevention, but stupidly no .onion server to retrieve msgs. <br /><br />EXPERIMENTAL - http://tox.im <br />A skype/social media encrypted and decentralized replacement put together by hackers on 4chan&#039;s /g/<br /><br />TorChat - https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/wiki<br /><br />I left out the bulk of .onion msg services because I don&#039;t trust them at all. <br />

				This is a good list for the short term, but for robust censorship resistance, we need decentralized services (including forums and markets and payment systems) so there is no central point of failure. Out of everything on that list, only Torchat doesn&#039;t rely on a central server. The trade off is it turns everyone into a hidden service, which in the default configuration makes users vulnerable to attacks that may identify them.<br /><br />What we really need is better security for hidden services, and then decentralized services built on top of them.<br /><br />We also need something like a Qubes Server Edition that has preconfigured LAMP and LEMP stacks with VM isolated components (web server vs mysql database, eg), plus VMs for Tor, ssh, any other services you would care to run (xmpp server, ircd, etc.). It would be like Tails / Whonix for hidden services, a complete out-of-the-box anonymous and secure server OS that would make it easy to spin secure hidden services.<br />

				I2p-Bote messages, bitmessage (the protocol/network.. not centralized bitmessage.ch front end) newsgroups/nym servers, and tox.im are all decentralized too. <br /><br />VMs are not any good for any sort of popular Tor service, memory is eaten up by the all the encrypted connections. OnionCloud it appears is in early concept stages, not at all ready to go and they will undoubtedly vet services so they don&#039;t end up like the Freedom Hosting guy. It will do what you want though, PaaS application hosting so anybody can turnkey their own hidden service. <br /><br />We need more stuff like GnuNetwork applications instead of Tor anyways, Tor was designed for usability not traffic analysis defense which wasn&#039;t important back in 2006 but now it is. There is a lot of decentralized software being built but it&#039;s heavy crypto engineering, which means these PHDs won&#039;t release it until after a year or so of testing. Just rushing something out ends up like Crypto.cat debacle.

Remember though, Hushmail claimed they couldn&#039;t read your encrypted email either. They got around this when forced by the authorities by presenting the target with a MITM attack login screen. Instead of the usual login screen, you got one that leaked your password in the clear to the FBI. No reason countermail can&#039;t feed you the same MITM login to spill to the feds but you said you&#039;re using PGP on top of it so doesn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />I used to use countermail (with PGP) and they killed my account when a junkie nutjob complained relentlessly confusing me for another vendor claiming I ripped him off of heroin, something I never sold. The admin sent me warnings, and then with no further communication cancelled the paid account I had.&nbsp;

No other new decentralized crypto services will be ready anytime soon either, they need vetting and alpha/beta testing for a year or so at least. There&#039;s a mathematician working on PGP replacement which uses keyfiles and updates the protocol but the guy has been testing it with his crypto PHD analyst peers for a year still. He updates hacker news once in a while but like all crypto engineers is unwilling to release it until perfected because they have academic reputations to uphold so that takes a long time.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nym servers are ok. kmf has talked about some the PIR methods that are information theoretically secure, so as long as they are implemented in safe ways, they can be a good alternative.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I was any kind of mega dealer I would definitely be using a nym server/mixminion. JonDonym CD comes with mixminion if you want a live CD solution, it&#039;s an awesome Type III Anonymous remailer solution that still works today. You can tunnel Tor through Jondo mixmasters and then tunnel mixminion through both. You can buy Icelandic domains + email with bitcoins to forward your (PGP encrypted) customer emails too so nobody even knows you are using a nym server or mixminion, and reply with the Icelandic domain as your reply-to address. It&#039;s probably the best solution around because then trolls, pyscho customers trying to extort you with threats to your provider and aggressive competitors spamming you won&#039;t be able to kill your communications easily. Feds can never find you with anonymous padding, timing delay, plus Tor. At least in the carding game you get these kinds of customers and attacks from competitors, I&#039;m sure it happens now too in the dope game. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I hadn&#039;t heard of tox.im so quickly read up on it.

The other problem is the host OS can see what the VPS is doing. Even if you rent the VPS anonymously, you run the risk of the provider noticing you&#039;re doing something illegal and canceling the service or notifying LE.<br /><br />On the other hand, a lot of people can&#039;t afford multiple dedicated servers for physical isolation, or it&#039;s just not worth it for them. While physical isolation is better, one dedicated server with some VMs is still way better than running naked services over Tor, and it&#039;s within more people&#039;s budgets.<br />

				I am not really all that tech educated; much of what is being posted is over my head. I just thought I would ask you pros a question, though. Whatever email service is used, PGP/GPG is used only for the body of the email, correct? Or do you guys use it somehow for signing in, as well. I am pretty new at this. I haven&#039;t yet performed any transactions...Any clarification would be great. Thank you in advance.

				Found some more options<br /><br />http://www.rayservers.com/e-mail Rayservers has email + Tor access and they accept digital gold currency probably bitcoin too if you ask or just convert bitcoin to Gold Globals somewhere. They&#039;re also Pecunix exchangers. Rayservers is pretty security competent, all their servers are in Panama and running openbsd and everything is encrypted on the server (but you&#039;re using PGP anyways right?) http://www.rayservers.com/blog/rayservers-mail-server-features-and-faq I don&#039;t see anything about removing the outbound IP, but who cares you&#039;re connecting with Tor and removing IP isn&#039;t foolproof anyways. The important part is everything is encrypted and you&#039;re staying .onion so no MITM attacks.<br /><br />If you buy your own domain and use it w/Rayservers (anon whois), it will be harder for a troll customer to shut you down than using &lt;name&gt;@countermail.com where they can war complain to abuse all day long to shut you down. Your rayservers email will be hidden, customer will only see domain address vendor@domain.su <br /><br />Don&#039;t pick a stupid name like LSDman@iselldrugs.com use something that doesn&#039;t automatically identify you as a drug dealer. <br /><br />You can use a domain w/Countermail too I think, but I don&#039;t like that java signup. and no .onion access <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I found two more email services that haven&#039;t been mentioned here.<br /><br />For anonymous communication, there&#039;s a Tor-only email provider at this address<br /><br />http://365u4txyqfy72nul.onion/mail/<br /><br />You can&#039;t send email to clearnet addresses and there is no web interface. You have to configure a desktop email client like Thunderbird.<br /><br />If you need a throw away clearnet email address for registering on web sites, receiving bitcoins, etc., there&#039;s Yandex Mail<br /><br />https://mail.yandex.com<br /><br />It&#039;s run by a Russian company with servers hosted in Russia.<br /><br />You can register over Tor and with JavaScript disabled, but you need to enable JavaScript to use the webmail interface. However, you can configure a desktop email client to use the POP and SMTP servers without logging into the webmail interface. Make sure you configure Thunderbird to connect over Tor.<br />

				Found another one, called Pond.<br /><br />https://pond.imperialviolet.org<br /><br />It isn&#039;t email. It&#039;s an independent messaging system, kind of like BitMessage, but hopefully it will be more secure. It is designed to run over Tor exclusively, and instead of being a true p2p messaging system like BitMessage, it relies on central nodes. Although, it still isn&#039;t as centralized as getting your messages from a single provider.<br /><br />Really the old model of email is insecure, outdated and needs to be replaced by a different kind of messaging protocol.<br />

				Yes. And if there&#039;s a better alternative to the now-gone Tormail I haven&#039;t found it.<br /><br />The alpha-numeric login is actually a Bitmessage address.

				While some people used Tormail to email clearnet recipients (and could use many clearnet email providers over Tor to do the same), the majority of Tormail users used it as an internal messaging system. Something as simple as TorPM could be an effective replacement, as long as it is stable and easily accessible (bonus if you can add attachments to messages).<br /><br />The down side is that you have to trust the operator of a centralized system to not read your messages or look at the metadata of who you are communicating with if you use PGP, but a messaging system like TorPM is easy to set up. I&#039;m surprised a replacement hasn&#039;t come along yet.<br />
