				You just log into your SR account, and then click the &quot;account&quot; link at the top of the page. In the middle of the page, you&#039;ll see a box that says, &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:&quot; and an address under that. Copy that address, and then in Bitcoin QT, click the &quot;Send coins&quot; button at the top of the window. Put your silk road address in the&nbsp; &quot;pay to&quot; field, enter the amount you want to send, and then click &quot;send&quot; on the bottom right corner of the window. Remember to subtract .01 BTC from the total you&#039;re sending to account for the transaction fee.<br /><br />Correct, you don&#039;t have to transfer the coins to the vendor directly. The SR site handles that automatically. If a vendor ever asks you to pay them directly, run far, far away.<br /><br />Some other tips:<br /><br />1.) Since you&#039;re just getting started, this will probably work ok for you, but in the future, I&#039;d suggest using a method similar to bitinstant.com direct to address-&gt;bitcoinfog-&gt;silk road account. It&#039;s fairly easy to track where the bitcoins came from and went when you don&#039;t use a mixer like bitcoin fog. Again, not a huge deal, just do it the way you are now, but in the future look into something like that.<br /><br />2.) It can take about an hour for the confirmations and tumbling on the SR side, so don&#039;t panic when your coins have left your wallet, but nothing shows up in your SR account.<br /><br />3.) Each time you deposit money into your SR account, you should generate a new address. This can be done by clicking, &quot;get a new address&quot; on your account page.<br /><br />Good luck! I hope everything goes well

				I 100% agree with Banjo. Bitinstant is gonna be your best bet. It&#039;s really fast and easy. I use the bank deposit method. First time the coins took a whole day to show up in my wallet. The next time I changed my wallet address, deposited money at the bank and they were there in 2 hours....nice.

				and one more question ;) ... for the vendor of my choice.... I have to finalize early...like apparently everbody does (saw in the feedback)&nbsp; - sesampino by the way... so thats quite unsafe right? when the moneys gone, its gone...? what is that &#039;in escrow&#039; thing about? sorry, I&#039;m not that familiar with &quot;advanced english&quot;.... ;)

				Yes, unfortunately bitinstant.com is only available in the US. Anyone can use bitcoin fog though. If you&#039;re buying your bitcoins by money transfer from your bank account, you should definitely use bitcoin fog.<br /><br />New buyers are often required to finalize early. I, and many others, refuse to do business with anyone who requires early finalization for everyone. Once you get about 5 successful purchases under your belt, you should have no problem finding vendors who won&#039;t ask you to finalize early.<br /><br />You&#039;re correct. If you finalize early, the money is gone, and there&#039;s nothing you can do to get it back. So, you&#039;re completely at the good will of the vendor at that point. If the vendor doesn&#039;t require you to finalize early, then DO NOT DO IT. There&#039;s nothing dumber than all this feedback I see all over the place of, &quot;FE for trusted seller&quot;. Fucking idiots.<br /><br />Anyway, the escrow system works like this (assuming you don&#039;t finalize early):<br />You make your purchase. Once the vendor says he&#039;s shipped it, the money goes into escrow. That means that SR is holding it, and neither you or the vendor will be able to access it.<br />Once you get your order, you click finalize, and the vendor then gets the money.<br /><br />If there is a problem, like the order never came, you got less than you paid for, the wrong product, etc... then you don&#039;t finalize it. First, you try and resolve it with the vendor yourself. Most of them are happy to work with you on an issue if it&#039;s a legit problem. If for whatever reason you and the vendor can&#039;t come to an agreement, then you can go to the resolution center. There, each of you can state your side of the story, and a SR administrator will make a ruling, and release the money from escrow to the appropriate party.<br /><br />Also, since you&#039;re in Europe, don&#039;t ever order from the vendor THEBuldog. He posts people&#039;s name and address here on the forums when he gets mad at them.

				wow, thanks a lot for your time...! I&#039;m always very pleased when people like you help out newbies like me... I just think when you order the very first time(in SL in general), it&#039;s kind of common sense to finalize early no? and it&#039;s gonna arrive sooner then, I guess... probably I&#039;m gonna take the risk ;) cause I want it at fast as possible!

Whether that was an error or whatever I don&#039;t know, but it just goes to show that communication is key, both as a buyer and a vendor.<br /><br />Anyway, the goodies arrived next day and were consumed to much merriment. <br /><br />When in doubt, ask. Vendors need customers, even new ones. It is a matter of who to trust, and good communications helps in that regard enormously in my opinion.<br /><br />
