				I know there are a ton of wicked smart people on here and excuse my ignorance but i would like to purchase something online anonymously.&nbsp; I am an avid user of SR and spend way too much money on here lol so i was hoping someone could help a sister out.&nbsp; It seems like everything requires you to give some sort of ID.&nbsp; I just would like a fast way to buy something with a visa or master card type credit card, without giving all my id info. Id appreciate any help! Even just pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated! Thanks<br /><br /><br />-CE

				I really don&#039;t think you asked your original question clearly enough. What is your end goal ? Of course using a credit card under your real identity is bad, it doesn&#039;t necessarily destroy your anonymity to do so but it certainly doesn&#039;t do anything for your anonymity to begin with and it is generally a bad place to start from.

				if your just tring to buy shit online go get a vanilla visa giftcard from one of the many stores that sell them (even dollar general) n u can load up to 500 per card. should be anon. enough for most stuff ud be buying on clearnet anyway. you can have ur item shipped wherever works for your situation im guessing not ur house if your remaining anon.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anyway should work i know mexicans that do this to buy shit on line cause they have no bank acct. or id.&nbsp;
