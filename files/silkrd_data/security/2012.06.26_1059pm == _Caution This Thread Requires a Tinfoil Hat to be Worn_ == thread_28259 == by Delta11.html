				So a good friend of mine sells a variety of psychedelics irl and off SR. He&#039;s a well established seller and is quite good at it, the other day he was shipping something he sold on ebay and as he was driving back from the post office to his house a car started following him but he didn&#039;t really pay attention. He took the shortcut on his way home which is through an alley and the car was still on his tail and then out of nowhere a car blocked the exit of the alley and agents rushed out of their cars with their guns drawn. Scared shitless, he got out with his hands way up in the air and they cuffed him and told him that they got an anonymous tip that he was shipping drugs. He denied everything and denied their request to search his car which agitated them (he had nothing to hide anyway). They called it in and asked for a search warrant for the package (he used USPS), once they got the go ahead they opened the package only to find the item he sold from ebay and no drugs whatsoever. They apologized and said they rarely get misleading anonymous tips but it happens, then they let him go and he never had a problem since.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s the part that I don&#039;t understand and hopefully someone can shed some light on this. Was it really an anonymous tip they received or have they been watching him and just figured he decided to finally ship out some psychs (he rarely ships anything)? Also, how did they know which package was his? Remember, they pulled him over after he dropped off the package so how did they know? Luckily he doesn&#039;t sell on SR so he has avoided this problem ever since the incident but what about the rest of us that do sell on SR? How can we avoid something like this from happening during our drops?

				I don&#039;t know, LE might have been telling the truth and it was a snitch. If they WERE staking out his house then why would they go through the trouble of tailing him and getting a warrant to search his car, why wouldn&#039;t get they get warrant to search his house? Unless they need more to get a warrant and they thought a bust in the car would provide enough evidence to pursue a residence warrant.<br /><br />Your first sentence is, &quot;So a good friend of mine sells a variety of psychedelics irl and off SR.&quot; Then at the end, &quot;Luckily he doesn&#039;t sell on SR&quot;. Does he sell on SR or no? If he does, possibly he mentioned this to a f2f customer who got busted and rolled on him?

The only time the DEA would jump like that on an anonymous tip is if they had evidence already and it would give them a chance to bump it to a trafficking charge (which is what they were trying to do clearly, that is rather transparent IMO). Also the DEA is a Federal branch of the Oinker family tree is it not? Oinkers of the Federal bloodline as don&#039;t fuck around like the Plod bloodline Oinkers, that&#039;s because Plod bloodline Oinkers are the minions in the chain and that is what they are meant to do, plod around like minions. They get the scraps while the Federal Oinkers get the best chow.

Now what would you do if someone was rocking up to your house at 6pm every night while your trying to have dinner with your family and the only way to get rid of him is to sign a piece of paper?

They reacted fast to a tip.<br />And the DEA does small time busts all the time. <br />Shit, they have a reality show on FX busting inner city gangs for half kilos of coke and pounds of weed.<br />They are a joke.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This.<br /><br />The DEA goes after anyone at the mid-level and above. That means middle men reselling to street dealers and definitely anyone selling online or in other places where feds have total jurisdiction. Someone probably snitched on your friend. It likely wasn&#039;t an &quot;anonymous tip&quot; but rather a very much nonymous statement from someone they are already &quot;working with&quot; if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Your circle should now be aware of the rat that is probably in their midst. That, or the DEA may have gotten some random intelligence from the postal inspector or some other hidden means that lead them to follow your friend whenever he prints stamps or it looks like he&#039;s mailing something. Depends on how careless he is versus how much he runs his mouth. They weren&#039;t actually investigating him for a while or else they would have made sure it was drugs in that package before they busted him, or they would have just followed him to an in-person deal and swooped in the second an exchange was made. If I were him, I&#039;d avoid doing in-person deals as well as anything online until I could make sure none of the people I sold to were possible informants. I still think the local snitch or a similar character tipped them off. That&#039;s usually the source of most cases like this.

If they WERE staking out his house then why would they go through the trouble of tailing him and getting a warrant to search his car, why wouldn&#039;t get they get warrant to search his house? Unless they need more to get a warrant and they thought a bust in the car would provide enough evidence to pursue a residence warrant.<br /><br />Your first sentence is, &quot;So a good friend of mine sells a variety of psychedelics irl and off SR.&quot; Then at the end, &quot;Luckily he doesn&#039;t sell on SR&quot;. Does he sell on SR or no? If he does, possibly he mentioned this to a f2f customer who got busted and rolled on him?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i may be wrong here, but it seems to me that if it was a snitch they would already have warrants in place for the car, house, etc. In my area of the country, at least, LE does a lot of &quot;fishing trips&quot; like this hoping the perp will spill the beans and let something slip under pressure.
