				Ok so i have most of my security aspects covered, However i am far from an expert. <br />I have a couple of questions that i need answered that i just dont fully understand. Thanks in advance for your answers. <br />So even if you are using tails and tor bundles your isp can still check if you are connecting to the tor network, and Agencies if they were looking to you could gain a much further advancement of knowledge on your behaviors.<br /><br />my questions are this.<br />So does using the torbundle with built in obfsproxy basically mask that you are using tor to your ISP?<br />will you need to update tails&#039;s bridges periodically even in &quot;bridge mode&quot;<br />is the partition encrypted enough with the linux encryption or should you install truecrypt as well and add the secret drive thing in as well?<br /><br />And it frequently says that bridges arent completely safe even obfuscated bridges, So how do you make this properly safe? And what would the protocol be? <br />Would it be smething like connect to Tails using a VPN like torguard, and using bridges at the same time. Have everything encrypted such as your HD or if you just boot from usb have that encrypted. . would this mask the fact that you were using tor? this is more a question about the VPN aspect and keeping things hidden from your ISP originally. Not to do with encrypting things etc.<br /><br />i take it the new TBB with the obfsproxy built in isn&#039;t enough? <br /><br />i really appreciate all your help, Some people round here know im always asking for help, but i figure it&#039;s better to ask and be clued up than be full of it and really know nothing.<br /><br />thanks in advance, i know some people are going to hate me for asking all this lol

				If you don&#039;t want your ISP to see what you&#039;re accessing you need to have your connection encrypted. You do this through a VPN. TrueCrypt is only offline protection is should only be used as a last ditch effort to protect yourself (if you are storing illegal files on your computer). I recommend Air VPN because they are cheap, can be purchased using bitcoin, and does exactly what it needs to do. As for tails I don&#039;t personally use it but really all you need is Tor and a VPN for SR stuff.

				Honestly if you live in big city you really don&#039;t need to hide TOR usage. If a package coming from your area is intercepted they&#039;re not going to check everyone using TOR. Drug dealers mail drugs too and a lot of them don&#039;t use TOR at all. They won&#039;t even bother to do an investigation, customs are gonna seize it and send a love letter but that&#039;s it. If it gets intercepted on a domestic order I also don&#039;t think they&#039;ll care, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re shipping kilos of weed in one package.<br /><br />What&#039;s important is using TOR safely, which is why I&#039;d recommend whonix over something Debian or Ubuntu. Full disk encryption should also be used, it&#039;s not much of a hassle and it gives more peace of mind. Also, run something like BleachBit (with secure deletion enabled) regularily to remove possible traces of whonix being run if it&#039;s in a hidden partition, and other hidden files being opened.<br /><br />Honestly I wouldn&#039;t bother with obfsproxy unless you&#039;re in a rural area, and even then if you&#039;re small time it&#039;s not that important. Someone that hide TOR usage is more suspicious than someone that doesn&#039;t. Convince your friends to use TOR too and you&#039;ll be safer that way.

Many OSs keep logs of opened software, or if it&#039;s not logs it&#039;s some traces in another form. Linux shouldn&#039;t leave many traces but using BleachBit (open source obviously) is a good thing to do IMHO. Having the hidden volume on a flash drive leaves traces but the advantage there is that it&#039;s easily thrown away and broken, you shouldn&#039;t use an SSD though!

It only takes like 1minute to clean so it&#039;s really not so annoying. And a flash drive uses the same type of memory as an SSD so they both have the same security issues and it&#039;s easy to determine that a hidden volume exists on the drive. An SSD is even worse though. <br />Qubes is pretty cool too, it runs each software in a different VM, so that all things you do are completely isolated,! It sounds pretty cool but I think whonix is better for routing all traffic through TOR, I&#039;m not sure if Qubes does that.<br />You&#039;re welcome mate :P
