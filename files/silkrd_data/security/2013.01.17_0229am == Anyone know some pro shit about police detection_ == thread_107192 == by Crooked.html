				I know you can go to radioshack and buy some pretty fancy radar detectors and whatnot. but does anyone know of any detection equipment that can pick up on and alert to any clandestine operatives. i.e. a detective conducting regular surveillance on a residence?<br /><br />Anyone care to share some beginner&#039;s info on RF jammers, white noise generators, or other cool, useful spytech that can be utilized by the paranoid SR user?

				you&#039;ll probably attract more police attention with jammers and generators.<br />just get some wired CCTV with motion detection, some decent hiding places etc. <br />dont have any shit laying around

				If they&#039;re already drilling holes in your wall to snake in cameras, you&#039;ll probably need the help of someone involved in counter surveillance. LE won&#039;t bother going crazy like that unless you&#039;re involved in something high dollar or otherwise serious. Usually they&#039;ll be limited to basic physical surveillance, wire taps, attacking wireless networks, garbage picking, and going through records. The first one is usually obvious, especially if you&#039;re aware of your surroundings and notice strange cars or people following you around. They can extremely covert if necessary, but that doesn&#039;t happen unless you&#039;re a high profile target or there&#039;s some other special reason to justify it.<br /><br />As for taps and bugs, the latter aren&#039;t common at all while the former are impossible to detect these days. Cops listen to your phone calls while sitting at a workstation at the office connected directly to your wireless or landline provider. Depending on the severity of your case, bugs/wires can be easy to find or they can be extremely well hidden. In most cases, you can find wires on people with commercial equipment assuming searching them isn&#039;t an option. Detecting the kind of bugs LE will realistically use should also be possible with commercial bug detectors. However, there aren&#039;t any one-size-fits-all solutions outside of consulting someone involved in this sort of thing. If you can&#039;t afford to, odds are you won&#039;t need that kind of security.
