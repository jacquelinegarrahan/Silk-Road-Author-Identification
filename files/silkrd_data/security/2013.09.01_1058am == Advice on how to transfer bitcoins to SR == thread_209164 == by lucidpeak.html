				Hello, i bought some bitcoins at localbitcoins.com. My question: Is it safe to directly transfer coins to SR from mentioned page or is it better to transfer coins first to my wallet (i am using electrum wallet) and than to SR. Is the ownership of coins traceable anyway. Any thoughts on that would be great.&nbsp; :D

				this belongs in newbie discussion but...<br /><br />the safest bet would be to move them from lbc wallet to a tor wallet (could be blockchain.info via tor, or a local client connected to tor), then to bitcoinfog via tor, then to SR.&nbsp; otherwise, the link to SR is not hard to establish at all.&nbsp; bitcoinfog charges 1-3%.&nbsp; &nbsp;this can all be worthless without other security precautions such as ensuring your pc is not compromised, so read up and do things right.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />true peace of mind is fucking priceless!

				Personally I just transfer the coins directly to my SR account but I&#039;d like to hear others thoughts on this. Silk Road has its own built in tumbling service but lots of people question its effectiveness. Is it really that sketchy to transfer your coins directly into SR or do people just like taking those extra precautions to be safe? Obviously &quot;better safe than sorry,&quot; but can that bitcoin &quot;trail&quot; really be tracked back to you that easily if you don&#039;t use a third party tumbling service? <br /><br />Sorry to answer your question with questions :P I&#039;m just curious on this subject as well.

				if you&#039;re involved in selling on the road then you&#039;d probably be best advised to take those extra precautions. but if you&#039;re just planning on buying a gram or two of weed or something of low value then you need to consider that transfering through multiple btc wallets will put the price of your drugs up way more than they already are.

				i&#039;ll say it again, peace of mind is fucking priceless.&nbsp; cost of moving btc to a wallet is about 5 cents so &quot;transfering through multiple btc wallets will put the price of your drugs up&quot; is total nonsense.&nbsp; only real fee you&#039;d be adding is from bitcoinfog which is 1-3%.&nbsp; so if you&#039;re spending $200, that&#039;s $2-6 more.&nbsp; &nbsp;if you&#039;re buying a gram of weed, it&#039;d be like what, 20-60 cents more?&nbsp; the point applies no matter what you&#039;re buying.&nbsp; &nbsp;there is no point in not taking precautions when they&#039;re hardly expensive.
