				I live in the same town as the owners of Gspot and know, through a friend, that their account has been compromised, and their homes have been under surveillance for several weeks. If you look at the forums they (and their alt account which is really easy to figure out) have been ordering bulk MDMA pills.<br /><br />The owners, one of whom I know personally, have been bragging about being Silk Road vendors at dance parties and pissed off more than a couple of people. GHB in small town USA is a big deal. I messaged Gspot (and their buyer account) about the fact that one of the people they pissed off being a fucking cop&#039;s kid, and they took down their listings and (stupidly, I thought) their Facebook accounts. I can only assume they are cleaning house as hard as they can right now.<br /><br />They then emailed me saying this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; I am unsure who these people are I recently purchased this account off Hack BB and will be setting up my listings soon </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see three things having possibly happened. Either they are covering their tracks in the most awkward manner possible, or they have been arrested, or they have sold their vendor account and the account cannot be trusted.<br /><br />I&#039;m a Silk Roader for six months now and I wanted to warn the community that if you have ordered from them in the last few weeks you need to clean house right now. I am happy to give proof to Silk Road administrators, but pretty much anyone who has received from them can look at my name and verify that I know what&#039;s up.<br /><br />Be careful.

				Oh so now I know the name of the twit who linked his Silkroad account to his facebook.&nbsp; They were just asking to be busted.&nbsp; I feel no remorse for them.
