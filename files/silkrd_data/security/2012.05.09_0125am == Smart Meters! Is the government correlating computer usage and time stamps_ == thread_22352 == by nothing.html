				what is the thinking here?&nbsp; Is there a way around this?&nbsp; A super computer could easily correlate such simple information as each post has time stamps..........And is there such a thing as micro surges when larger data is transfered that is noticeable.....I think CPU chips have to be variable in power usage.......NSA datamining?&nbsp; no need to crack your system we have you already monitored 24/7????

				smart meters in the EU will come for every household and have to be installed in every new build house.<br /><br />And they can make pretty accurate profiles but not as accurate to check the useage of a CPU.<br /><br />On the other hand beware if you grow weed. They see the &quot;light&quot; periods pretty exactly.

				I don&#039;t know, it seems it would not actually be that difficult to monitor micro surges, you are underestimating all the talent and funds driven into &quot;spyware&quot; the last decade in unison with the police states..........they profile everyone because it works.......<br /><br />they don&#039;t care who wins and who loses as they run the game and in essence always win no matter what (except until they destroy nature and the earth tottally) but that is besides the point, everything is subconciously a game.&nbsp; <br /><br />War is just a game of who will die and who will not in pointless killing at which the average man has no say in how the killing will be done and also will share not in any benefit no matter the outcome (At least in todays armies) they used to have a game of reward and split the pillage.&nbsp; There is no such things as justice, liberty, freedom, tyranny ect merely constructs of the imagination........<br /><br />freedom is a state of mind, what is Justice?&nbsp; even if someone pays with their life it does not undo what is done?&nbsp; it is just the imagination that is satisfied, but is that really justice?&nbsp; it does not exist.........true love is also merely just a construct of humans, it does not exist......every relationship human, has some form of requirement known or hidden that makes it work........for example if you cheat your true love is no longer true love,,,,,,it was merely a construct......here today gone tommorow......

				@kmfkewm&nbsp; Nice post.&nbsp; you should also look into the smart phone attack that runs a key logger that reads keystrokes by measuring feedback from the accelerometer.&nbsp; (keep your smartphone on the floor or at least on a pillow if its on your computer desk)<br /><br /><br /><br />This is just an idea but perhaps you should mix up your internet usage:<br /><br />Use tor to visit sites other than silk for part of your internet time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[this gives you time online that your SR user is not online]<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of logging in at the same times.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[repetitive patterns are easier to track than variable ones]<br />If possible find a secure secondary location to login from.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [this gives your SR time online while you appear offline in your real life location]<br /><br />(VPNs to another country are also a good plan)<br />[between these three suggestions it&#039;s at least not blatantly obvious that you are only surfing the net while you are logged into SR]<br /><br /><br />In addition to the methods mentioned buy 12345 and nothing it would also be possible to monitor via a sufficient number of LEO run Tor nodes or even something as simple as subpoenaing ISPs to hand over their records of you accessing Tor.

				The main point of smart meters is to measure your &quot;peak billing usage&quot; so they can fleece you for money. They claim it&#039;s so they can catch power thieves and grow-ops but that was just so the public would allow these spying machines on to their property.<br /><br />If you get a smart meter be prepared for your bill to triple in size the first month. They claim it&#039;s because the old meters weren&#039;t accurate enough which is total bullshit. Multiple attempts to hack these things have been successful if you check all the Blackhat 2011 and 2010 conference presentations freely available<br />

				first, sorry brothers for my gibberish - it&#039;s 5 AM and I can&#039;t sleep.<br /><br />LOVE this thread !!!<br /><br />A few years ago, they busted some guy - perhaps a dealer or something?&nbsp; -&nbsp; By using his smart phone to listen in on conversations even when the phone was not in use - the trick was to always remove the battery - also good for keeping your GPS location to yourself.<br /><br />I sent these links to my brother who I told about a year or two ago that &quot;they&quot; can listen and know what you are typing as every key on your keyboard has it&#039;s own, unique sound.<br /><br />(no tin-foil hat)<br /><br /><br />Cheers/

				yes, they can do that. it was about two or three years ago, now that I remember reading the article.<br /><br />they were not sure if he had sent in his phone for repairs and they fucked with it or if it was a backdoor that all/most/some smart phones have.<br /><br />
