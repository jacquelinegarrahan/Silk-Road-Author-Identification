				Sup<br /><br />Been looking into this for awhile here s what I ve found so far.<br /><br />Intersango has a Metro bank account which I could feasibly put cash into, but they only have branches in London for the cost of what i am doing its not worth the expense of getting there.<br /><br />Mt Gox has a Barclays Bank Account, went today and the teller told me its not valid.&nbsp; Re checked the details i had written down and they were as they appear on the Mt Gox site, lost all faith in dealing with them as this seems highly unprofessional and a bit shady.<br /><br />Ukash to bitcoins seems like scammer heaven, all google searches i ve done have led me to just scam artists and the few reputable money changers on here have said they wont do it, which tbh I can understand.<br /><br />I appreciate that the bitcoin encryption is meant to be solid etc but I am not enjoying whacking unaccounted cash into my bank then transferring that day and repeating week after week.<br /><br />Anyone got a good method for doing what it says in the title, namely ANONYMOUSLY getting physical £&#039;s to bitcoins?<br /><br />PS for any scammers browsing this I wont be going to any shady reagnn.nl or whatever it is and giving you Ukash numbers so gtfo.<br /><br />All help much appreciated.

				Just to update my apologies to Mt Gox is fine to deposit to with the details they gave on their Barclays account, unfortunetly I dealt with an inept idiot teller who told me that the details were invalid when they CATEGORICALLY ARE CORRECT.
