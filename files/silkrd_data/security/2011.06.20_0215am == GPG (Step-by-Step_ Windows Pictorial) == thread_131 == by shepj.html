				All of my notes are in red. They are present for a reason, read them.<br /><br />Step 1) Download GNUPG<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/01-Download.jpg)<br /><br />Step 2) Install GNUPG<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/02-InstallGPA.jpg)<br /><br />Step 3) Open GPA<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/03-OpenGPA.jpg)<br /><br />* GPA Main Menu<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/04-GPAMainOpened.jpg)<br /><br />Step 4) Generating a Key<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/05-GenerateNewKey.jpg)<br /><br />* Enter Name<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/06-GenerateaKey-EnterName.jpg)<br /><br />* Enter Email Address<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/07-GenerateaKey-EnterEmail.jpg)<br /><br />* Backing Up Your Key<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/08-GenerateaKey-BackupKey.jpg)<br /><br />Step 5) Creating / Entering Your Passphrase<br /><br />This step I will elaborate on. Your key needs to be extremely strong, having a 50-70 character password is not unheard of. The more characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) your passphrase contains, the harder it will be to crack. Also, when it is time to generate your key, the more you mess around on your computer (opening &amp; closing files, listening to music, moving your mouse, etc.) the better the entropy.<br /><br />Never store your key electronically. I recommend having two copies of your key WRITTEN. Storing your key is useless and will give LEO your passphrase (should your computer ever be compromised).<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/09-GenerateaKey-EnterPassphrase.jpg)<br /><br />* Re-enter Passphrase<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/10-GenerateaKey-Re-enterPassphrase.jpg)<br /><br />Step 6) Key Generation Complete<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/11-KeyCreated.jpg)<br /><br />Step 7) Encrypting Messages<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/12-EncryptingMessages.jpg)<br /><br />*Selecting a Key (the addressee)<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/13-Encryption.jpg)<br /><br />*Encrypted Message<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/14-EncryptedMessage.jpg)<br /><br />Step 8) Decrypting Messages<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/15-DecryptingaMessage.jpg)<br /><br />*Message Decrypted<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/16-Decrypted.jpg)<br /><br />The pictorial will be updated, as I need to elaborate on Key Exportation and utilizing Notepad. This is the beginning.

				Is the vulnerability of physical evidence the reason we have encryption in the first place? If the feds are on to you, they&#039;ll find your sticky note. What about sticking your super-long pw&#039;s in an encrypted container with an easier to remember, but still long, pw? Seems to be the best way to have all the security for sensitive online stuff while still being safe and accessible.

				I found a way from using Thunderbird with the Enigmail plugin to copy and sign my keys and then using Cryptophane to encrypt normal messages.&nbsp; I like the management with Enigmail and the ability to sign things like my address when ordering with Cryptophane.&nbsp; My problem with Cryptophane is that I haven&#039;t figured out how to add labels/emails to each key so it looks likes this:<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=da1a6d42ede9ea4591c86a08fedb03f9.jpg<br /><br />Which gets a little confusing...

				How can I import my private key to another computer? I just bought a new laptop, and after installing GPG the key manager wants me to generate a new key. When I try to import my personal key via a USB stick from my desktop it only imports the public key, and I can&#039;t decrypt with it. Is there a way to get my private key on the new computer without resorting to just generating a new key altogether?

				I use Tails live OS to browse SR and keep by keys etc, the GUI is called Seahorse. The option for me is &quot;Export complete key&quot; which exports the private key, it took me a while to find this option. &quot;Export&quot; simply exports the public key.

Open GPG Keychain Access and click &quot;New&quot;. Enter your username or a fake name and your tormail or a fake email. You can select whether or not you want to have the key expire too. Leave everything else default. <br />After you click &quot;Generate Key&quot;, it will prompt you for a passphrase. The longer and more complex the better.<br /><br />---Importing a Sellers Key---<br />Start by pasting the public key on their page to a TextEdit window. Be sure to include everything from the first dash to the last dash. Next select Format-&gt;Make Plain Text. Then save the doc to your desktop.<br />Open GPG Keychain Access and click &quot;Import&quot;, then select the doc. The key should now appear in the list.<br /><br />---Composing a Message---<br />Open System Preferences-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Services. Scroll down to &quot;Text&quot; and check off all the OpenPGP options. Open a new TextEdit window and write your plaintext. Right click in the window and click &quot;OpenPGP: Insert my key&quot;. Select your key and press &quot;Choose private-key&quot;.&nbsp; Now your public key should appear in the box below your text. Always remember to insert your public key when sending a message to someone for the first time, as if you do not include it they will not be able to reply using your cipher. Select the text and right click again. This time select Services-&gt;OpenPGP: Encrypt. From the list that appears choose the recipient&#039;s key. You may have to repeat this step if it doesn&#039;t work the first time. The cyphertext should now appear in the window beginning with &quot;-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----&quot; and ending with a similar footer. This can now be sent.<br /><br />---Decrypting---<br />Paste your received message into TextEdit and select all. Use &quot;OpenPGP: Decrypt&quot; to decipher the message. A prompt will ask for your passphrase. You should be left with a plaintext message afterwards.<br /><br /><br />I think this info is all correct, but I&#039;m new to GPG too so feel free to correct me.<br />

				Thanks a lot, great tutorial! Even before I started using Tor I tried to learn about PGP and it never made any sense to me... until now!<br /><br />Just one question: I understand the logic and mechanism of two people encrypting messages using each other&#039;s public keys so only the intended recipient (with the private key) can read them... but when and why would I sign a message? If I sign a message, the recipient needs my public key to decrypt it, right? So, is the practice to send every message but the first one both encrypted and signed?

				Thanks a lot, Drunk N High! It&#039;s good to feel useful! :D<br /><br />Claws Mail is a nice little e-mail client that integrates PGP functionality, so it&#039;s pretty convenient for sending and receiving encrypted messages. But you&#039;re not correct in thinking that you *should* use it. There are other solutions. For example, using Thunderbird with the Enigmail plugin, which gives it the same PGP functionality. Personally, I just use GPA&#039;s clipboard to encrypt my messages, then copy and send them through tormail.net&#039;s webmail client (and the reverse for receiving, i.e. copy them from the webmail client into GPA&#039;s clipboard and decrypt).<br /><br />But I confess I haven&#039;t looked into the security aspect of this too deeply. It might be that Claws Mail is more secure than what I&#039;m doing, or that Enigmail has some glaring security flaw I&#039;m not aware of... hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me will clear your doubts better.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck! If you find out more about this, I&quot;d love to hear from you myself. :)

				ok thank you, im getting the hang of it now i think, one more question.<br /><br />when ecryping the message, should you encrypt ONLY your plain text message and THEN add your public key to the bottom?<br /><br />OR<br /><br />write your plain text, then wright YOUR key, THEN encrypt the whole message?<br /><br />OR <br /><br />attach your key to your email in an attached file and leave it out of the message body..<br /><br />havnt got a reply from a vendor back yet.. think i may have did it wrong..

				- some people like to add their gpg / pgp public key cut &amp; paste as text at the bottom of the text &quot;email&quot;, then encrypt the whole thing ...yes<br /><br />- the other is adding the .asc public key as an attachment, this helps with being able to be saved directly as a file for later use;.<br /><br />- its down to how people work whether they favour one or the other, of course you can do both above methods, encrypt all and add as attachment.<br />&nbsp;<br />

				Hey guys, forgive me if this is an obnoxious question, but I am not understanding how to encrypt my address on SR when placing an order, or how to encrypt SR messages. After reading through the tutorial and this topic, all I am seeing is instructions on encrypting email. Is this just me still not fully understanding the program, or is it as simple as copy and pasting the vendor&#039;s public key at the end of the box where your address is entered? <br /><br />I&#039;m obviously a noob, but I&#039;ve been reading for a week now trying to get this right... disappointingly I had my first order cancelled today by the vendor. There was no message so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I&#039;m unknown or because I didn&#039;t encrypt my messages. If it&#039;s as simple as just re-reading the tutorial I&#039;ll give it another shot but wanted to throw this out there first (regarding encrypting one&#039;s address). <br /><br />Thanks for everyone&#039;s patience on here while us noobs figure this shit out!&nbsp; :D

Your key needs to be extremely strong, having a 50-70 character password is not unheard of. The more characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) your passphrase contains, the harder it will be to crack. Also, when it is time to generate your key, the more you mess around on your computer (opening &amp; closing files, listening to music, moving your mouse, etc.) the better the entropy.<br /><br />Never store your key electronically. I recommend having two copies of your key WRITTEN. Storing your key is useless and will give LEO your passphrase (should your computer ever be compromised).<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/09-GenerateaKey-EnterPassphrase.jpg)<br /><br />* Re-enter Passphrase<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/10-GenerateaKey-Re-enterPassphrase.jpg)<br /><br />Step 6) Key Generation Complete<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/11-KeyCreated.jpg)<br /><br />Step 7) Encrypting Messages<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/12-EncryptingMessages.jpg)<br /><br />*Selecting a Key (the addressee)<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/13-Encryption.jpg)<br /><br />*Encrypted Message<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/14-EncryptedMessage.jpg)<br /><br />Step 8) Decrypting Messages<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/15-DecryptingaMessage.jpg)<br /><br />*Message Decrypted<br /><br />(http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n610/pictorialone/GNUPG%20Step-by-Step/16-Decrypted.jpg)<br /><br />The pictorial will be updated, as I need to elaborate on Key Exportation and utilizing Notepad.

				Hi, everyone<br /><br />I have the PGP for Windows software, the one with Kleopatra as the administrating application. It&#039;s already downloaded and setup; I have a private and public certificate, know how to import others&#039; public certificates, and can decrypt messages as well. The only aspect of it that I have a problem with is the encryption of emails. I compose a message in a text editor such as Wordpad or Notepad, save it as a &#039;plain text&#039; file, then try to encrypt it with the program, and the result I get is either a text with Chinese or other foreign characters but not cryptography! What&#039;s going on?! Can anyone give advice?<br /><br />By the way, saving the file in a different format like &#039;Rich-Text Format&#039; (rtf) or &#039;Unicode Text Document&#039; or &#039;MS-DOS Text Document&#039; does not help either.<br /><br />Thank you.

				I&#039;ve been working on this for weeks now. Each time I come back in here daily and spend hours reading posts I learn just a tiny bit more. I just used the GPG (Step-by-Step: Windows Pictorial) and sent myself an encrypted message. Hoo-ray - right? <br /><br />NOT! I have 2 keys, both (wrong or not) with the same pass phrase. Both saved on a 1 gig USB. I tried both keys and entered the pass phrase 5 times each. Can&#039;t copy and past it so I watched my finger and punched in each character 5 times each. Each time it said the password was incorrect!<br /><br />I checked the pass phrase 4 times for each key right after I used them. It is the same one that my GNU says is wrong now. <br /><br />I give up!<br /><br />I think SR should just encrypt everything they want encrypeted. It&#039;s their assess too and they have a lot more money and smarts than I do. Trust that! Lol.<br /><br />Oz

				..nope, its in your best interests to encrypt your own messages its not just SR messaging here, the gpg/pgp thing is used when encrypting / decrypting msg&#039;s outside of<br />&nbsp; SR too; there&#039;s only so much someone should be spoon fed; the obvious reason why gpg/pgp is an individual responsibility is the owner needs to own / maintain their<br />&nbsp; own keys so this is also why its back to our own apps, i suppose you could pay someone some service to do it for you...but then you&#039;re partly back to the reason why<br />&nbsp; gov&#039;s own and think for everyone cos the general public don&#039;t want responsibility and expect gov&#039;s &amp; local authorities to regulate more and more.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I was skipping it anyway because it crashes at each launch. BUT, check this...<br /><br />Derp. I had a feeling that the five (!!) downloads and installations of Gpg4win had somethin&#039; wrong with the files or installation. So I got a brand new copy of the bundle from a site other than the one I tried the first five times, and installed everything except Claws mail. Removed some fussy VPN software, so it makes me mildly suspicious that was part of the problem.<br /><br />Launched GPA and easily created the first key. This time when I launched GPA the only difference was that when it asked me if I wanted to backup the key during creation, I declined. Then I copied the key later to a secure, encrypted location.

				Wow! I just want to say, what a great thread and big ups to ShepJ for the visual tutorial. It&#039;s what finally made it sink in for me. Took me a couple tries, but I think I&#039;ve got it. It&#039;s amazing how the lightbulb just turns on after a little bit of time invested in reading and then practicing. And I want to thank Traveling &amp; CrunchyFrog. Some of your answers were exactly what I needed as they were pretty clear. I was confused on encrypting the message with my public key at the bottom and then pasting it, you guys cleared that up as well as the whole signing process! AWESOME community here!! Now I just need to figure out a secure email service since tormail is not allowing new registrants :/ lol Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

				I am so fucking lost....<br /><br />I have downloaded the GPG4win bundle, and when I open the Kleopatra program I can create a key (or certificate as it calls it) - <br /><br />After this I have NO IDEA! I do not see a clipboard on kleopatra. All it has is my certificate on it. I don&#039;t know what to do, and I have the first three pages of this post. My one vendor has disappeared and now the new one wants me to encrypt, but I still don&#039;t know how! It would be easy if there was a clipboard, but I do not see one. I don&#039;t know, the original guide was for a different program, it looked different and everything. <br /><br />This is so frustrating because I RARELY have problems figuring anything out, and I am just stuck with a freaking key I created, and no further knowledge of how to even START a message to use the key. I even tried to import a vendors public key, but since there is no clipboard I opened up a text doc on my computer and pasted the public key for this vendor. I then went to &quot;Import Certificate&quot; and the file wouldn&#039;t even show up as one I could import. <br /><br />Please help, at least with a link for a dummy guide for Kleopatra that someone here has used. <br /><br />Thank&nbsp; you, for whoever helps me.<br /><br />Eco

				Hey ecopaktm, I&#039;m not an expert obviously, I&#039;m a newbie. But when you download the GPG4Win, there&#039;s a prompt that asks you what you want parts of the program that you want to install. The GPA is unchecked by default. It&#039;s the second one in the list I believe. Check that box. If you have to, go through the unistall and reinstall because i&#039;m not sure how to add it after it&#039;s been installed. Once that is checked in the install process, you&#039;ll get the GPA app on your desktop and that is the program that nice picture tutorial is from that ShepJ did. I was lost too, until I realized that. Hope that helps

				Thanks a massive amount to all the contributors here - seemed daunting at first but the pictorial is spot and and makes it pretty simple to get your head around.<br /><br />Just a quick question - if LE were to (worst case scenario) somehow open your version of GPA would this work as evidence (i.e. they open it and see a stored key with the name as same username in SR, additionally other keys with username of sellers if you had not deleted them)? <br /><br />Or would it be a case of without the pass code they could not really do anything???<br /><br />From this do people then not use the same username as SR / Forum for the GNU key? Noticed already that some sellers keys will bring up other information on them in GNU, i.e. email addy, SR username<br /><br />*<br />Also it would seem the best way for security would be not using email and just PM encrypted messages through SR - less of a trail? <br />I am probably totally wrong as not very technically savvy but for me this seems certainly the easiest way.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the help from the community here<br /><br />D<br /><br />P.S - bit of a silly question but just wanting to confirm doing this all right - <br /><br />EDIT: Answered this last question myself!

Noticed already that some sellers keys will bring up other information on them in GNU, i.e. email addy, SR username<br /><br />*<br />Also it would seem the best way for security would be not using email and just PM encrypted messages through SR - less of a trail? <br />I am probably totally wrong as not very technically savvy but for me this seems certainly the easiest way.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the help from the community here<br /><br />D<br /><br />P.S - bit of a silly question but just wanting to confirm doing this all right - <br /><br />EDIT: Answered this last question myself!

Use VM Ware Workstation. Then use truecrypt (open source=free) and encrypt the whole virtual machine. They&#039;ll never be able to open it to see any kind of evidence. Deny everything.

				Yep you&#039;re almost there bro. What I do after reading it several places on here is after typing your address in the clipboard before encrypting it to post to the address box on SR is to paste YOUR Public key below your typed address and then encrypt that whole thing so when they decrypt it on their side they&#039;ll have your address and your public key. So yeah you encrypt your address with the sellers public key and they read/decrypt with their private key and vice versa if they send you a message back. Cheers!

				Hello everyone. New GPA user here and I am having what I believe to be problems. I created a public key and a passphrase. I go on clipboard, write a message and encrypt with MY key. I then decrypt and type my passphrase, the message appears. However, i tryed encrypting a message with someone elses public key, and when I try to decrypt, GPA says &quot;Clipboard contained no valid encrypted data.&quot; So i then signed the message encrypted with another persons public key and then hit decrypt. A notification pops up and says &quot;Clipboard does not contain any OpenPGP data.&quot;<br /><br />Can anyone help me or point me in the right direction here?

				You can&#039;t decrypt messages that are encrypted to other people&#039;s keys. Like if you write me a message and encrypt it with my key, only I can decrypt it.<br /><br />You write the message, sign it and then encrypt it. If you&#039;ll sign an encrypted message GPA won&#039;t detect the PGP message (no OpenPGP data) unless you select just the part that starts with -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- instead of the whole -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----.

				Sorry I can&#039;t help more lamonteyoung. No Mac here.<br /><br />You encrypt the message with the receiver&#039;s key which should posted in his profile. Maybe you have to ask for it, it depends on the vendor. You send it via PM, email, etc. If you have specific problems with encrypting it tell me the name of your software and I&#039;ll check it out.<br /><br />For BigScrote.

			<dd class="postbody">
				So after days of trying to read all the forums on GPG for Macs (yes I know they are hard work at times like this) and testing all the great tutorials one after the other, I am still close, but no cigar.&nbsp; I have a&nbsp; mac air running lion 10.74 which when I download GPG 9.9 it says it is not compatible.&nbsp; Have tried to install GPG 10.1 but it still reads as 9.9 and same problem.&nbsp; Tried Guru&#039;s &#039;nightly&#039; link as he had similar issue I think but no joy.&nbsp; Tor seems to crash constantly on 10.74 too, I have to install it each time to use browser - many forums on that and apparently it is a glitch with Tor.&nbsp; So now I have dug out my old macbook and after trying two of those great tutorials, I got as far as creating my own keys but when importing vendor keys from text edit, the saved file won&#039;t highlight as an option. Not sure what that is about. So read further down the forum and apparently GPG is only compatible with 10.6 and above - my macbook is 10.58 so crap once again.&nbsp; Tried one more tutorial (you guys are seriously fucking awesome) but got stuck at changing keyboard options and text edit options as there is no &#039;service&#039; option in my preferences. So.. I noticed one person suggested privenot.com and it looks super simple but not sure if vendors like it or if it is as easy and safe as it sounds.&nbsp; I have tried to read all the advice before posting another &#039;help me&#039; note but seriously, any tech heads out there know what I am missing??<br />Thanks!

				Thanks a lot for this guide, it made getting started with PGP a lot simpler than I thought it would be!<br /><br />I only just joined here, and the sheer amount of work people have put into protecting their own and others&#039; privacy online through services such as Tor and PGP is amazing to me.

				This seems very straightforward, but I&#039;m having trouble figuring out how to select the addressee&#039;s public key. Can anyone help me out? Here&#039;s what I did:<br />1. generated my key, okay no problems there<br />2. created a text file of the addressee&#039;s public key and imported it, just fine so far<br />3. clicked Clipboard, wrote my message<br />4. clicked Encrypt... under &#039;Public Keys&#039; I can only see my own key that I generated... I cannot see the public key that I imported, so I can&#039;t encrypt a message to that user...<br /><br />Am I doing something wrong? I tried a variety of things, refreshed my key list, restarted the program, tried selecting either my own key or the public key before going to clipboard... nothing... it only lets me encrypt to myself. What am I missing?<br /><br />Edit: Now I see that the public key I imported is actually expired, obviously that&#039;s why I can&#039;t select it. problem solved

				Ok now I&#039;ve spent the last two or three months scouring Tor and its forums trying to find out how to encrypt/decrypt/send encrypted messages/etc. and I have obviously found the OP to be VERY HELPFUL. But I am also assuming that, like many visual learners out there like me, prefer to see things in real time rather than click, paste, look, repeat. Here is a link to a youtube video that helped me out tremendously. Once again big props to the OP for helping out a noob like me in understanding the vast world of encryption and computer logistics. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SywCI91kfq0&amp;feature=related<br /><br />Please be cautious when viewing this video on the tor network or on unprotected computers as they can be linked to you.<br />CHEERS!&nbsp;

				please help me. i downloaded gpg4win from the website www.gpg4win.org and I read everything connected with it, even the installation process step by step with pictures. well, I downloaded it, but the installation process that they showed me with pictures step by step did not take place. And I can&#039;t even find my download. I looked in &quot;downloads&quot; and it&#039;s empty. so can you please help?<br />because first I read wiki like I was told to on the forum, and did what I was told and no gpg4win! so i have no encryption so I can&#039;t order anything. I thought this was kind of too good to be true anyway, ordering whatever I need. yeah, right.<br />&nbsp;Is there someone I can communicate with, or ONE CENTRAL LOCATION where newbies like myself can just follow step by step, and then have it actually work?!<br /><br />First I read wiki like instructed to on the forum. Itt led me to a site where I can download gpg4win. I read and watched the instructions with pictures, and then I downloaded it. It never went through the installation process, and gpg4win is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />. This reminds me of a maze with 50 different forks in the road, all leading to nowhere!! <br /><br />Here, you can buy this medicine that you desperately need and cannot spare any time getting it because you need it NOW, oh, but here it is for you. All you have to do is A, B, C, D, and E before you can order this medicine from me. But as far as how to do A, B, C, D, and E, there&#039;s no clear road how to do that. <br /><br />I spent days dicking around on here. Can you get ONE CENTRAL LOCATION and say this is what you do? There has to be hundreds like me. Not everyone is a computer geek. We all have different skills. It doesn&#039;t mean someone is lazy. I&#039;d even be willing to pay for the help, if there was a number to call or a person I could communicate with, or even one central location for the information I need to do A, B, C, D and E.<br /><br /><br />

				Just type PGP Encryption in YouTube, click the first video and follow the tutorial. It doesn&#039;t get any easier or informative than that. There is a bunch of videos on it. It took me 5 minutes to master it after beating my head over the table trying to figure it out for days. It&#039;s really as simple as 123. Remember to check the GPA tab. That&#039;s the most important one. Good Luck and feel free to message me if you have any questions that you want answered from a newbies perspective.
