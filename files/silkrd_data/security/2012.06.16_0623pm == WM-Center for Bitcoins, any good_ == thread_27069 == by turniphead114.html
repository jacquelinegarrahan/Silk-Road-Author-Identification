				Hi guys. Does anyone know if the site at https://wm-center.com/index.html is any good? I think they operate out of Russia. I couldn&#039;t find any info using the SR forum search.<br />Thanks in advance.<br />

				I&#039;ve used them several times over the last year without a problem.&nbsp; Their fees are fair and they are pretty good with communications.&nbsp; Usually if i order during the day ill have themlate nite or in themorning when i get up.&nbsp; Theyhave been experiencing DDos attacks lately it seems and it delayed my order a few days, but other than that its been reliable.&nbsp; Hope this helps.<br /><br />Dr. K

				Their fees are not very good compared with places like https://www.bitinstant.com/ where the fees are at least half and you get your coins immediately. There are definitely worse exchangers so give them a try. You should expect them in around 36-48 hrs from my experiences, which were around 6 months ago. Their english isn&#039;t great but they are available and willing to help. Also, the info they give you to send the money to, I am guessing it will be via WU or MG, are extremely complex. If you send the transfer with the name misspelled (usually not your fault but the fault of the cashier at WU) then you will have lost your money if your using fake info (which you MUST) so definitely have the cashier READ out letter by letter what info they have typed in before they submit the transfer so you don&#039;t lose your money.
