				Fucking yes.<br /><br />It is things like this that start revolutions. The community of SR should be one of the better audiences to contribute to a project like this. I know many of us have the funds to do so.&nbsp; 8)

				You would think but I guess no one trusts the link is legit.<br /><br />Basically the ISP encrypts all ingoing and outgoing data in a way that makes it impossible for them to simply hand over any data to the authorities or any third party. Truly anonymous web surfing by making it really hard to find which data is whos.

				The plan to start up a privacy-centric ISP is definitely for real.&nbsp; Just take a look at the list of people that are on their advisory board.&nbsp; Some of those folks are extremely well-known and well-respected in the privacy/anonymity/infosec world.&nbsp; Shit, if I had a spare $5K sitting around, I&#039;d throw it at their project (see hxxp://www.indiegogo.com/calyx) and get a couple of those cats to come hang out and shoot the shit with me for the day.

				Even if it does succeed, I wouldn&#039;t trust them to keep me secure. Would still use anonymizing networks like tor and tools like GPG to encrypt my communication.
