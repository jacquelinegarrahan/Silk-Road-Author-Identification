				Hey kids,<br /><br />Bitfloor has sent out an e-mail and you can visit their website (clearnet) to see the message posted.&nbsp; They are shutting down indefinitely.&nbsp; I have quoted the message at the end of this post.<br /><br />Those of us who still have bitcoins/cash in the Bitfloor system can still access/withdraw them to other wallets.&nbsp; That said, I need to know of another service that allows buying/trading on the market.&nbsp; Since my lovely SR vendors are out of commission while the market corrects itself, I have invested in the market at lows and need an interface to place buy/sell orders (preferably without having to use my real information).<br /><br />Can anyone give me some safe suggestions?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The message from Bitfloor:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am sorry to announce that due to circumstances outside of our control BitFloor must cease all trading operations indefinitely. Unfortunately, our US bank account is scheduled to be closed and we can no longer provide the same level of USD deposits and withdrawals as we have in the past. As such, I have made the decision to halt operations and return all funds.<br /><br />Over the next days we will be working with all clients to ensure that everyone receives their funds. Please be patient as we process your request.<br /><br />- Roman<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Unfortunately, I think that may be your only option.&nbsp; They ceased trading officially at 18:00 EST.<br /><br />You may be able to send in a support e-mail/ticket and get them transferred over by taking a hit; but, I wouldn&#039;t bet money on them allowing this due to the amount of customers they have.

				I need help too. Bitfloor / LocalTill, LLC stole $412 from me.&nbsp; &gt;:( <br /><br />I made a deposit on mon 4/15 and they say it never went through. I emailed them for support about 3 hrs after since it was taking awhile to go through and did not here back from them till the next day. They asked for a copy of the deposit receipt. I emailed a copy. They said &quot;We have no such deposit. Please follow up with the bank to ensure they have properly credited out account.&quot; <br />I went back to the bank today to verify and the bank verified it went through &quot;almost immediately&quot;... Now I come home from the bank and email them again. Log in to these forums and see this thread&nbsp; :-[ :-[ Im so pissed right now&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( I have no Idea what to do. This was my first time trying to buy BTC too. I did my research and everyone on the forums had nothing but good things to say about Bitfloor. Now i&#039;m out a lot of $ and feel like shit. I mean i would at least not feel as bad if I got scammed by a vendor or something illegal. But buying bitcoins through a reputable website. At least I thought it was.&nbsp; :( <br /><br />If anyone has any advise for me on how I can get my $ back please do tell.

				I just heard the news myself, fuuuck that blows.&nbsp; I was using BitMe before bitfloor so i guess i&#039;ll go back to that.&nbsp; The problem with them is you usually end up paying a few extra dollars a btc then the actual mtgox rate but they are just as fast as bitfloor.&nbsp; They are under maitenance right now though so hopefully they come back up soon. ugghh

				I&#039;ve heard a lot of good things about CBX around the web.&nbsp; I will be trying them next.<br /><br />..as soon as my funds are available.&nbsp; I transferred them out of Bitfloor to Blockchain for temporary storage while I researched other places.&nbsp; Aaaannnnddd, of course, that is down now too.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s an uneasy feeling--having so much money just &quot;lost&quot; somewhere between web servers with no way to see it&#039;s okay.

				This is lame. I literally just figured out how to use bitfloor to sell bitcoins and deposit them into my bank account yesterday. Just my luck that they fucking close down the same day. Does mtgox allow deposits into bank accounts? I am only planning on using these BTC for legal trading, so if i have to provide an I.D then there is no problem

So unless you want to mail them 2 IDs and a gas bill... you might be SOL. This is why you should NEVER deposit funds into an account that is in a country regulated by AML/KYC regulation. You either have to verify yourself (Like Gox) or the exchange gets accounts frozen due to lack of AML/KYC documentation. <br /><br />Remember you didn&#039;t get scammed by BitFloor or LocalTill you got scammed by the American Financial System.

Mt. Gox is based in Japan, so a bank transfer would have to be by international wire. There&#039;s some info about that in their Funding Options &gt; Withdraw Funds tab, but it looked too clunky for me. If you get verified on BOTH Mt. Gox and Dwolla, then I think you can move back and forth between your bank and Mt. Gox. Not sure how fast - I think maybe a few days for transfers to finish. <br /><br />I&#039;m getting very gun-shy about smaller exchanges. Not that Gox is any perfect deal, of course. I&#039;ve said before - I hope that this whole past month results in a more robust and reliable infrastructure for bitcoins.

After FinCEN was going to classify them as a money transmitter (forcing AML/KYC regulation) they refunded all current balances and closed up shop. Not as unfortunate as BitFloor&#039;s accounts being frozen with balances still inside.

				Man, I thought that I was SO screwed. I didn&#039;t find out about the BitFloor account freeze until late April 18. I went there and most of my money was in BTC. (and it had gone up, so that was good-especially since I&#039;ve heard you can&#039;t get money out of the account)<br />I went and filled out the withdrawl and the BTC address I wanted it at. <br />Like I said, I thought that I was screwed but by about 330 am, it was in my wallet. <br />So happy, you can&#039;t believe. <br />I think it must have been the government/banks that screwed BitFloor up. &#039;For our own good of course&#039; &#039;Or the childrens&#039; or whatever the focus groups figure are the best weasol words for theft, like Cyprus did to it&#039;s depositers. <br />This thing was getting ALL TOO INTERESTING for me. <br />Maybe I&#039;m a paranoid nut, but the only enity that could/would do all this stuff lately is the government, but I&#039;d be happy to be talked out of it. <br />I&#039;m only sorry that I sold some of my BTC after it went down, it&#039;s already back up to where I would have made money

I used Bitinstant for the first time the other day, it&nbsp; went well, i had the BTC in my wallet in about 5 minutes or less. I didn&#039;t like using a fake name though and having to sign a receipt. I think i&#039;ll give blue sky a try next time.

				Just to say that speedybitcoins is a pretty good service but you&#039;ll need to request an invite and their support are pretty slow doing this. Also localbitcoins always has a better price than bitbargain which I think is well over priced! There used to be a very easy way to get money into bitstamp but UK banks are now blocking transfers to exchanges so be careful. Transferwise was a great solution for SEPA transfers but again will not deposit to exchanges now. Good luck&nbsp; ;)

				Thanks potroast. Wal-mart is a bit of a drive for me but worth it to keep me as anon as possible.
