				It&#039;s not necessary to use a prepaid cc if your just a buyer really. Just an unnecessary cost IMO.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a vendor I&#039;d suggest heading over to HackBB and getting an anonymous prepaid card. Obviously this isn&#039;t a launder method but can certainly add more layers to your cashout.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />Dank

				well i suppose you&#039;re right, acquiring bitcoins *is* completely legal...but i still get this feeling that the minute i exchange money for bc at the bank, a flag will be raised that i&#039;m a potential SR customer.... my anonymity goes from a pool of 7 billion people down to however many people are known bitcoin exchangers, and i don&#039;t know about you, but i DO NOT want to be in that pool. I&#039;d like to find a way to somehow turn green cash into bitcoins.... <br /><br />

				In the US, as far as I know, all of the prepaid cards require you to register the card and provide verification of name, address, social, etc.<br />So even though we can all buy green dot money packs without id, if you want a prepaid credit card to buy things with, you have to provide identification.<br /><br />So, even though buying bitcoins is legal, if you buy bitcoins with your prepaid credit card, you have created a paper trail that leads back to you (if the coins were traced backwards)<br />

				I&#039;m going to read up on the bitcoin system to get a better understanding of how it works, and more importantly, how big the pool is. Anyone have an estimate of how big it is? Few thousand/million people?
