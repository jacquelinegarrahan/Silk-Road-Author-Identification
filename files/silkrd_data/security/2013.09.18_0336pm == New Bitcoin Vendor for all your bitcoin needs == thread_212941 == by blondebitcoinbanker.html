				Hello,<br /><br />I am a retired banker who has been recruited by some top silk road vendors to provide bitcoins for silk road customers.<br /><br />As many of you know there have been quite a few closures of Bitcoin Exchanges.&nbsp; Many of the exchanges still open are requiring ID and are no longer anonymous for the buyers.&nbsp; You can be assured that BBB will be your go to Bitcoin vendor for fast, safe, and stress free transactions for Bitcoins!<br /><br />I have been a lurker on silk road for many months and have seen the many Bitcoin scams that are posted nearly everyday.&nbsp; I can assure you I am here to do business.<br /><br />The vendors I am working with will provide limited Bitcoins (50 - 100) on a daily basis.&nbsp; I will most likely sell out everyday, what that allows me to do is not to take to many orders, allowing me to provide excellent service to my customers everyday.<br /><br />My rates are posted on my main page<br /><br /><br /><br />I will accept:&nbsp; Vanilla Moneypacks, Reloadit&#039;s, and cash in the mail.&nbsp; Greendot&#039;s will only be accepted on a VERY limited basis.<br /><br />

				What protections do we have when purchasing through you? I assume escrow is not involved so it feels dangerous.<br /><br />Do we gain anything for the higher fees compared to a service like LocalBitcoins?<br /><br />What are your usual hours of operation and how fast can we expect our BitCoins during that time?<br /><br /><br />Thanks. :)

				Hello,<br /><br />Thanks for the questions......there are many ways to get you and any customers their bitcoins........I have also sold on local bitcoins.com&nbsp; ......meeting someone you do not know or depositing money into someones BOA account is not without risks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Customers will buy a listing ....complete with SR feedback.<br /><br />The vendors who recruited me have been providing bitcoins for the top bitcoin vendors on SR for many months......have seen lots of them come and go.....have seen lots of bad vendors who rip people off.....have seen it all with these fly by night vendors.........They decided months ago to find someone who is professional, who understand business, who understand customer service, and who understands money.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can do all of that every day for my customers......and that is the plan.....to be available daily for all your bitcoin needs........these vendors are in the top 5% of all vendors, and they need their customers to have quick access to bitcoins to make their SR purchases go smoothly.<br /><br />My experience was with trading currencies......I will do 2 transfers daily directly to customers SR account.......8am &amp; 6 pm pacific time.<br /><br />Of course there will be times, I can make transfers faster......but experience tells me.....to set transfer times.....and if transfers are made sooner.....better for the customer.<br /><br />Thanks

				Dont buy your story<br /><br />1. Vendors recruited you? meaning they know you irl? why would they need anyone else to handle their money.<br />2. your vending on an illegal site and giving away your drop address.....<br />3. why pay 12% when you can pay 1% on localbitcoins?

				Hello,<br /><br />Not sure what you mean.....Vendors want to make sure their customers have access to bitcoins quickly.....and yes they recruited me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have also sold bitcoins on Local bitcoins .....I never sold any at 1% over MT gox or Bitstamp......but if you can get them for that......more power to you.<br /><br />I put the bitcoins right in your SR account in a few hours......once the funds are confirmed.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Sounds risky to me. Way to easy for you to be a scam. Why not have these &quot;top vendors&quot; vouch for you on here if they did in fact &quot;recruit&quot; you?

				Hello.....It&#039;s not a dumb question at all.......I just looked at quite a few of the bitcoin vendors and rates vary.....but the Bitcoin rate is where the SR user could get hurt the most.<br /><br />Some are using the Mtgox rate and then saying their fees are low....3% to 8%......but the Mtgox rate is Weighted Avg:$141.33157&nbsp; &nbsp; SR bitcoin rate currently is ฿1 = $134.53 (keep in mind these are always changing)....so that is almost a $7 difference in the bitcoin rate.....so those low fees ....may not be so low at all.<br /><br />We use the SR bitcoin rate for all transactions.....when compared to others our rates are very competitive.<br /><br />Now as far as fees.....the answer is yes you will pay a premium for your bitcoins......but BBB will put them right in your&nbsp; SR account in 24 hours or less.....sometimes in less than an hour....:) <br />&nbsp;
