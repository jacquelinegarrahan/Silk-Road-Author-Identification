				I also believe MockFrog and Boris are referring to the bitcoin client on one&#039;s computer. If you have coins in it, and something happens to your computer, naturally there is a danger that you may lose some or all of the coins. That goes without saying.<br /><br />I see where they misinterpreted what the OP was saying, however. Probably just misread it. Mock, Boris, the SR wallet is beyond one&#039;s control obviously. I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s ever lost coins that were in it or they&#039;d be screaming bloody murder. But anyone can make a mistake in reading, so good show you guys for giving what is essentially good advice. +1 for both of you.<br /><br />goblin

I assume you&#039;re referring to a Bitcoin client of the kind you can download from Bitcoin.org?<br /><br />Software wallets are safe to store Bitcoins provided you take some sensible precautions.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using the QT Bitcoin client (the one available for download on the main page of bitcoin.org by default) in the first instance you should encrypt your wallet with a strong password. This protects the crucial &quot;wallet.dat&quot; file which contains your private keys and therefore allows you to acces your own coins. Just go to Settings &gt; Encrypt Wallet<br /><br />The wallet.dat file can (and should!) be backed up regularly, you can find instructions on how to do this here:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Making_a_secure_workspace<br /><br />I would also suggest you read through the steps for securing your workspace as it contains some important information.<br /><br />If you run a Linux/Windows based OS it&#039;s possible to run a Bitcoin wallet entirely from a USB stick (preferably encrypted!) - this is how I store my emergency reserve of Bitcoins.<br /><br />Needless to say you shouldn&#039;t keep your wallet.dat backup on the same machine as your wallet itself!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				If you have coins in your SR wallet and SR goes down, your coins will be lost forever as i&#039;ve been told from another member.<br /><br />Try keep SR wallet empty when your not ordering for awhile.

				I had this same question about how safe the built in wallet is on SR. I&#039;ve noticed on the settings page you can have a back up wallet address just incase the road goes down. Then supposedly the balance will be sent to the back up address.
