				Hey, a lil while back someone posted a link to something along the lines of a website that indicated sr had been infiltrated because in court proceedings a govt organization did not did not reveal their witness because he was a mole in sr. Ive searched for the topic with no luck. If somebody please finds me that topic/link i&#039;ll send them good karma and perhaps a btc or two. THX!

				Wow, spamming multiple groups with this. I find nothing on it anywhere. Just a report of some one in the Netherlands that was busted and suspected of being on SR.<br /><br />Oh, and a few FOI requests that resulted in the acknowledgment by the FBI that they had no way to trace activity on the dark net due to the software employed. <br /><br />To me this post sounds like the FBI/DEA trying to attack SR by undermining confidence in the system. Even if they had an informant in SR, we are all connecting via Tor so the informant does what? gives them a list of anonymous people who connected? SR can not see who you are and the vendors are independent of the site owners and not known to each other. Hell, Ill bet the mods, admins, and the owner do not even know each others real names or information.<br />

				Shannon, the link you provided does not show an informant or that &quot;sr had been infiltrated&quot; The guy admitted to looking for SR and finding a CP site. It was the CP site he was reporting to the FBI.
