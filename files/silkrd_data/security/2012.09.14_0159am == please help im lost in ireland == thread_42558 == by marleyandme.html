				As far as getting bitcoins, you may have to do a couple of exchanges if there aren&#039;t any echangers that deal with you tokens or chips or whatever you call your money (I really am not trying to be rude with that, but I don&#039;t know what your currency is called.) you might have to do cash to euro (unless the irish use euros) euros to pecunix or LR, then LR to bitcoin. but is mtgox accepts the money used in Ireland, and I don&#039;t see why they wouldn&#039;t, just get your funds to them via bank wire or whatever options they have now, and buy your coins there, then transfer them to your personal wallet, then to instawallet, then to a gambling site,back to instawallet, then to bitfog, then into SR.<br /><br />you can probably skip at least 3 of those steps as instawallet mixes automatically. and you might have Irish options at mtgox or wmcenter.<br /><br />I guess I am trying to say is that I don&#039;t have any help directly, but I am bored and like to listen to myself type sometimes. search the forum with they cryptic box on the top right of the screen and see if the oracle is more helpful than I am.

				I really wasn&#039;t trying to be rude, it just happens sometimes beyond my control. whay currency is used in Ireland, because I really don&#039;t know. then I might be able to offer some non-asshole assistance.
