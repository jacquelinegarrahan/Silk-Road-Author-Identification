				In case you have not got an answer to this, after all this time, I would think No, it would not make any significant difference.<br /><br />I happened to be trawling through the security board and was amazed at the number of questions that either had not been answered or the OP could not be bothered to let us all know that he had an answer.

Using a anonymous VPN, the ISP will only see the VPN IP addess and not the Tor entry. The problem with this is, as Astor has pointed out, anonymous VPNs provide anonymity by policy meaning they could be persuaded to allow LE to track incoming IPs if presented with a warrant to do so. The other, probably much better, approach is to use bridges to access Tor. The result is the same (internet traffic appears like any other to the ISP) no Tor node entry detected. But with the added security of anonymity by design, not by policy.
