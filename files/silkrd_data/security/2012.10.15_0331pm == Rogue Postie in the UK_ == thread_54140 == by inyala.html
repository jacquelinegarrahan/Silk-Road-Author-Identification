				Hi fellow Silk Roaders<br />I&#039;m fairly new to SR - almost a month now. <br />Have been choosing vendors carefully, ones with good feedback, stats etc - but up to now 3 (possibly 4) of 8 of my orders over the past three weeks haven&#039;t yet appeared! From the feedback I know the sellers packaging is sound and stealthy. <br />Tend to place small orders for goods just in case they do get lost in the mail coming up to the north east of the country. I also decided to use some vendors in the UK as it tends to be quicker and our postal service/Royal Mail is fairly reliable and usually quick 3/4 days at the most.<br /><br />So 3 orders from UK not arrived and 1 from Poland.<br /><br />Any experience out there of rogue posties or suggestions? Thanks<br />

				Never had a problem, brought lots of stuff domestic and from foreigners.<br />Id check with your vendor see there expected delivery times, if there reputable its probably just a glitch.<br />Don&#039;t panic until auto finalize looms closer.

				if your postie knows u do drugs and he does drugs i think hell steal them all apart from the ones with barcodes on and just re pack any that arnt drugs<br /><br />i only no 2 posties personally and they both do smack and crack and 1 im good mates with&nbsp; and if he did my house i wouldnt order no way as hed take it, thats always been my biggest worry as he knows about sr and has acces to my mail and can take any from amsters etc <br />i could also order to other peoples houses though and get him to intercept but never done it ,
