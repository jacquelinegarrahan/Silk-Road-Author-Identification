				SWIM (I see nobody is using this terminology here, but I think he might be easier to identify than most people on this forum due to the nature of his issue ) got a bit hasty and kinda skipped the &quot;read the forums&quot; part in the Buyer&#039;s Guide, and made his first purchase on SR with bitcoins he purchased with funds transferred from his actual bank account. It arrived to him without an issue.<br />He just entered this subforum and noticed everyone here warns not to transfer BTCs you can be personally linked to anywhere near SR (he didn&#039;t even understand much of how BTCs work prior to making the purchase&nbsp; :-[ he understands it much better now).<br /><br />So... What should he expect now? Any tips for minimizing the damage?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.<br />
