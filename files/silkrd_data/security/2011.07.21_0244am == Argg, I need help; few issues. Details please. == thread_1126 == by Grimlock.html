				Alright I&#039;m gonna get right to it:<br /><br />I am selling things on SR, (under a pseudonym of course) and I want to know how to be safe. <br /><br />1. If I am sending something, I usually would use a different name, but how can I &quot;sell from an address&quot; I don&#039;t live/know anyone - at? And yes, I realize this is asking to give away tactics on being hidden, but I wouldn&#039;t be asking if I truly knew.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. I created a PGP key on Portable PGP and am using my Public Key on my &quot;status/profile&quot; page, but how can I use this, to send/receive encrypted messages from others? And besides, aren&#039;t messages pretty much hidden from all users except the one you&#039;re talking to? I mean for example, if you were talking to a LEA/LEO then encrypting messages wouldn&#039;t serve a purpose right? Confused...<br /><br />3. I know I should (and I will) send packages via USPS that way I don&#039;t worry about them opening my packages, (I definitely keep the suspicious of my packaging to a bare slim - nothing except the name/address -&gt; name/address). And if I was sending pills [e.i] then I would make sure that if someone shook the package it would not make a sound. How much safer can I get with sending the package? <br /><br />4. What is my private PGP key for? <br /><br />5. If the transaction goes smoothly, and I hope it will in the future, the BT will be transfered into my SR account? And via Tradehill I can get my money based on the economy of the BT right? How much more anonymous can I make the transaction between [person &gt; BT &gt; SR &gt; Tradehill &gt; Bank Account?]<br /><br />6. I know to use different identities for buying/selling, but I can&#039;t recall who, but someone said buying off of SR is stupid. Stupid why? I mean, I wouldn&#039;t mind purchasing a couple buds/pills for the occasional use. <br /><br />7. Arg I just read another thread about using coin tumblers and etc to anonymize transactions thru bank &gt; Tradehill/mtgov &gt; wallet &gt; SR and outgoing too. <br /><br />But I am completely and utterly confused. <br /><br />E.i If I sold something on SR and the BT came to my SR account after completing the transaction, then I can&#039;t just move my bitcoins to Tradehill and pull the USD out and into my real bank account? What more loopholes do I have to go thru to stay hidden? Using tumblers right? <br /><br />9. What are virgin coins? Or something like that - all I know is that bitcoins spread around from user to user in order to further anonymize users coins. But are &quot;virgin coins&quot; considered new bitcoins that enter the market using my USD from my bank account &gt; Tradehill? <br /><br />10. Should I be using Dwolla as a medium between my bank account to Tradehill? <br /><br />11. Reserved for more questions. <br /><br />Thanks in advance, Jesus, this a lot to ask someone. But please help me out. I just don&#039;t wanna screw myself over for not learning what I can.

				1.&nbsp; You should be sending under a business name, as over 3/4 of all physical mail is corporate and business reply mail.&nbsp; Pick a business in your area (I mean city, not next to your house) and use their return address.&nbsp; Or make your own business name up and use an existing address across town.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; PGP is good.&nbsp; It&#039;s major protection is so that if the site gets compromised by LE and the entire database siezed, your identity and your buyer&#039;s identities are protected. I always cringe when a buyer sends me their address without PGP encryption since if the site got siezed tomorrow LE would be able to see that so and so from here bought an ounce of bud from me.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; You will have to figure out your own methods.&nbsp; There is a forum thread under shipping from someone who interned at USPS with a lot of good info.&nbsp; It&#039;s the one with the most replies ;)<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use your private PGP key.&nbsp; Just forget about it, you won&#039;t need it one here, use your public one and just make sure you have a strong keypass for it.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Here is a thread where I have laid out what I do to make my BTC transactions anonymous:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1066.0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- usually you want to go something like this:&nbsp; Dwolla/LR/CC --&gt; Tradehill/MtGox --&gt; Tumbler&nbsp; --&gt; Bitcoin on PC&nbsp; --&gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;on the way in, and SR--&gt;Tumbler--&gt;Bitcoin PC --&gt;MtGox/Tradehill --&gt;LR/Dwolla/etc --&gt;Western Union, Moneygram, or an anonymous international credit card &lt;--- I use this.<br /><br />6.&nbsp; Buying off of SR is not stupid.&nbsp; You are an insane asshole if you buy from SR and use your seller account to do it, and you should be caught as a matter of principle.&nbsp; Just use PGP, create another public key for your buyer profile, that way you can use an established seller you know isn&#039;t LE and only they will have your ship info (and encrypted, to boot).<br /><br />7.&nbsp; please refer to number 5. thread.&nbsp; Yes, a tumbler is important becuase although it&#039;s extremely hard to actually track a BTC address, a tumbler makes it virtually impossible to tell what the coins were actually used for.<br /><br />8.&nbsp; My thoughts exactly<br /><br />9.&nbsp; Virgin coins are coins that have been generated brand new by being the address that calculates the new coin block.&nbsp; They have no transaction history in the block chain.<br /><br />10.&nbsp; You need to use something.&nbsp; Dwolla is alright I guess.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; Reserved for more answers.<br /><br />I do this because I am a fairly nice guy, and I care about the community.&nbsp; But I also do this so that if you want awesome bud or BC mushrooms you will come to me first.....<br /><br />Anarcho47 <br />

				I&#039;m glad he does have patience, unlike others who tend to just keep information to themselves. I just want to learn is that so bad? And thank *** that he didn&#039;t ask for BTC for the info. (I&#039;m talkin to you Joe).

				Nah, anarcho did good, but a lot of these questions have been answered already but I know it&#039;s a pain to plow thru everything and find all these answers.&nbsp; We hope we&#039;ll get a faq or something on here, as most of these are the same things all people here want to know...but yeah, anarcho does go above and beyond the call of duty...we all try tho...now it&#039;s your turn to help the next new guy ;)
