				Im just trying to purchase a few things for my own personal use, im honestly no good with computers or money so pretty much every thing on this site is confusing me, i have no idea where too start? I understand that i have to transfer my money into bit but apart from that im lost... all the abreviated terms like PGP has got me really confused. I know you have to be smart with these things, should I just give up because the last thing i want is to get caught but I just really have no idea...<br />thanks xx

				everything you need to get started is located here in the forums, there are many many pages of info, you just have to look.<br /><br />Spend a few hours or more reading as much as you can - try this guide to start with - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53140.0 - highlight the link, right click it then left click &#039;open in new tab&#039;<br /><br />if you find that too difficult, then my best advise is to find a friend who can do all this for you (good friend, trustworthy)

				sprinkles147, if you&#039;re that lost, you should do a lot of reading on the forum for a few weeks before you move forward with a purchase.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an easy guide to PGP: http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />As for bitcoins, that can be trickier to figure out, depending on where you live. I suggest searching and reading all the bitcoin related threads you can find on the forum.

				I&#039;m assuming you live in the USA? So that being said, I&#039;m going to give you tips on what I do and how I do it.<br /><br />Create a Tor Mail account so you can send messages to Blue Sky Traders (which is how I get my coins) Tor Mail Link ---&gt; http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion<br /><br />Getting coins - I use Blue Sky Traders (ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm) Just follow the directions on their site, this is about as easy as it gets. I send the coins directly to my SR address and have never had a problem for the 7 months that I have been here, fuck paying for coin foggers and shit like that. To each their own though&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Then after you get your coins from BST, which may take an hour or a lil longer to get into your account, you can place your first order! Just click on an item and then in the box below after you hit add to cart put your address <br />Example: <br />Hugh Janus<br />123 Eat Puss Dr.<br />Fatfuckville, FL, 45823<br />United States of America<br /><br />And thats basically it for the basics!<br /><br />

				Most importantly remember to take extreme caution when you can.<br /><br />ex. Marking your SR package as RETURN TO SENDER and waiting at least 3 days is a good practice. <br />Just in case the police come to your house and try to prosecute you for that package.<br /><br />there&#039;s a lot more practices out there, read around the forums before you fully buy something. the forums is your friend.
