				Hey all,<br /><br />New to SR and still learning all the ins and outs with regard to security. I made my first btc purchase today, Anon Moneygram to Instawallet to Instawallet to Bitcoin Fog. Everything seemed smooth until I logged out of Bitcoin Fog and an hour later couldn&#039;t log back in. I had typed my password in notepad, written it on an index card and then typed the password into the registration page straight off my index card when I set up the account. An hour later the password I had written down wouldn&#039;t work, or any variation of it (and I tried many). <br /><br />The only explanations that I can come up with are that either 1) somehow I typed my password incorrectly twice into btcfog while registering (apparently terribly incorrectly, because some 50 close variations won&#039;t work either) or 2) someone is logging my keystrokes and changed my password once I had deposited my money.<br /><br />Obviously this is very unfortunate for me, and a bit embarrassing. Luckily it&#039;s my first purchase on SR so the amount is fairly small, but nonetheless. I can&#039;t fathom that I fucked the password up, and my only other explanation is a security breach. Malware bytes and avast haven&#039;t detected anything, but obviously that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m safe. I&#039;d like to boot liberte off a usb, but haven&#039;t been able to get the computer to read liberte on startup. Aside from this option are there any other ways to avoid keylogging?<br /><br />Any thoughts on my situation? Am I just a dipshit that can&#039;t transcribe a password? Did btcfog rip me off? Is bitfog even necessary for a relatively small transaction (under $100). Is Liberte good to use for such a small-timer as myself? Can&#039;t a stork just drop a 10 strip of L on my porch and then I won&#039;t have to go through all this?<br /><br />I appreciate the thoughts.<br /><br />Discouraged,<br />Sink
