				Hey, I&#039;m still newer but have been reading up constantly to try to educate myself on the important matters involved with being on here, however, I am not entirely confident in myself yet to not to feel obligated to reach out to the rest of you for advice.<br /><br />In a rush to make a cash deposit this morning for some bitcoins, I could not get bitinstant to work and tried contacting their phone line multiple times for help yet no one answered. So, in a pinch to get coins I went and tried get-bitcoin.com because I saw some good reviews highlighting how anonymous the transactions were. Assuming that the policies for transfers were different than those of bitinstant for over $1000 since they were not clearly stated anywhere, I made a deposit with a value between $1600 and $1800. Now, I know that the service that these sites offer is perfectly legitimate, and if LE wanted to check if I had been using these sources they very well could, however unlikely that may be, but get-bitcoin.com contacted me and said they need a photo of my ID before they can process this transfer through. How serious is it of a risk to send them a photo? I know it&#039;s not ideal and all, but how much does it compromise my ability to remain safe enough to make one purchase? <br /><br />It&#039;s too bad that I can&#039;t just e-mail them back and be like, &quot;Oh, may I please have that split up into two deposits for $850 each then please?&quot;<br /><br />Thanks anyone and everyone for your help and I apologize for the silly nature of this question.&nbsp;

I can&#039;t believe they wouldn&#039;t have said on it that they needed that ID for such a large sum. Did you check it before running to the bank to put down your hard-earned cash?&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean this as criticism of you, understand, but you must be used to running risks, either that or you&#039;re rich. I would never think of plonking down such a sum of money on an unknown to me service; I would start off with much smaller amounts, just to see if everything is on the level with them.<br /><br />But that&#039;s water under the bridge. Send them the ID as you can&#039;t get your money back anyway. Then when you get your bitcoins, sell them immediately and get your cash back through a currency exchange service, even if at a loss. That is, don&#039;t use the BTC for anything illegal. Next time, send a much smaller amount, and first ask them on the sly what the limit is for totally anonymous cash to BTC transactions.

				Use a service like bitcoin fog once you get your coins.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be everything but will make your coins harder to trace

				goblin, I totally understand man and appreciate your feedback! No, surprisingly they did not provide any notice in the e-mail confirmation with the order number and account to deposit to that detailed it either! The only mention of it on their site is buried deep within their FAQ, which I did glance at real quick before purchasing but did not notice it. So, I will admit that part of the blame lies on me even though I think it&#039;s enough that a person could argue with the company. But, I really don&#039;t have an interest in doing that at all. <br /><br />yournamehere, Do you think running them from instawallet to bitcoinfog before SR would be sufficient?
