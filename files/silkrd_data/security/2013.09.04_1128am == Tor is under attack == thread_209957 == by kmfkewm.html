				Yep, tor-talk has some interesting discussion about the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some traffic from exit nodes attacking relays.<br /><br />It&#039;s a hard problem for Tor to solve.&nbsp; They can&#039;t implement IP-based filtering or logging for obvious philosophical reasons.&nbsp; I think &quot;hope it goes away&quot; is the current answer.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like that answer.<br /><br />Building circuits to hidden services seems heavily impacted.&nbsp; Not sure if that&#039;s because of number of hops necessary, or because of load on HSDir/etc infrastructure.&nbsp; Or if some nodes are just refusing to return hidden service descriptors.

				Yes maybe large traffic clogging or other correlation attack. consider who would have motive to do this. think not hackers ;)<br /><br />testing of new massive government data center that open over in US very recent? <br /><br />also think attacks on FH maybe smoke screen for other attack that happened then too. remember some people say jscript change very early in attack.&nbsp; foods for minds&nbsp; :o

You can search for them on torstatus.blutmagie.de<br /><br />They botnet are just Tor clients, not relays. The amount of relays didn&#039;t increase significantly since the botnet started to screw around.
