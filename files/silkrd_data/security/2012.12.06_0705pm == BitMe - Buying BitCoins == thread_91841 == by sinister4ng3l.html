				I just used BitMe for the first time today. It said the money was in my account before I could send them a picture of my receipt. Now the question is, how do I buy the bitcoins now that the money is in my BitMe account? It keeps saying there&#039;s insufficient funds even though there&#039;s clearly money in there.

				Hello I was going through the same thing that you are just a few days ago! And my advice is to NOT USE bitme again! <br /><br />It has been 4 days since I made my purchase and I still do not have any bitcoins to withdraw. Yes it it quick for them to put the money in your account but the next step is to go on the main page and you have to put in the information like how many you want to buy, so there is 2 steps. First you get the money which it seems like you have already got that, then you have to make an order to purchase the bitcoins and then you have to wait untill a seller agrees to sell you at the price you put in . And I am still waiting after 4 days for someone to sell me some coins./<br /><br />This was my first time using the website BitMe and MY LAST TIME&gt; I DO NOT recommend<br />.... take too long

				I&#039;m having the same issue. Notice that there is a balance that has the amount of money you deposited, and then a zero next to it under the word &#039;available.&#039; I think the funds show as soon as you deposit, but for them to be available, you have to send the pic of the receipts and they have to receive and acknowledge it before you can use the funds.

				I agree, at first I was a fan of bitme.com, but now I made a post urging buyers to stop using.&nbsp; It has become a bad market where prices have become too inflated for buyers.

				The exchange has to be paid, the seller has to be paid, everyone takes their cut no matter where you buy them from.&nbsp; Ask some SR BTC vendors to sell on Bitme, its profitable, legal, and safer than moneygrams, western unions, and moneypaks.
