				I have a problem with Mac GPG keychain access.<br />I can import public keys, but of the 20 keys only half shows up for selection when encrypting a message.<br />Anybody have an idea as to why this happens and what I can do to get it work.<br />I use TextEdit to write my address and it works fine otherwise.<br />

				I have GPG keychain for Mac too.<br /><br />What you are experiencing is the glitch in the program.&nbsp; Its there sometimes and other times its not.<br /><br />What I do is:<br /><br />- reboot<br />- Go to control panels, then look for GPG control panel.&nbsp; Click about.&nbsp; YOu will see a button in there called FIX GPG.&nbsp; click it.&nbsp; It will repair GPG to some degree.<br /><br />Now, it should be working or if not, reboot again. .&nbsp; suck eh?&nbsp; They are aware of the glitch and they recommend to just wait for the next nightly build of the software coming soon. .&nbsp; .<br /><br />Another trick is to disable or remove the public keys you don&#039;t need or leave only the ones you use frequently.&nbsp; This may help.<br /><br /><br />Mine sometimes shows no private key in the menu, or sometimes your glitch of no public keys, or some missing from the menu.<br /><br />You are not alone ,but I&#039;m happy with mine doing the above tricks. .&nbsp; &nbsp;I find it helps to only use text edit and not use GPG in any other programs like a web browser or email.&nbsp; Thats where my glitch comes to life. . . .when I try GPG menu (in services) in any other program.<br /><br />take care!<br /><br />j

				Thank you Jediknight. K+1 :) <br />I have found another app that does the job. It is called SimpleGPGEncrypt and I recommend it to all Mac users having the same problem.

				I was having the same problem. Another member of this forum helped me by letting me know that the October 10, 2012 build of GPGTools does not exhibit the bug. I found it, installed it, and now everything works like it&#039;s supposed to. I don&#039;t understand why the latest versions haven&#039;t fixed it, but at least I can use the tools without any issues.

				I&#039;m gonna say up front that this post isn&#039;t really going to be a helpful one.&nbsp; I struggled with GPG Tools since the day I installed it.&nbsp; Had issue after issue (the one the OP mentioned being among them), kept emailing support and getting half-ass answers or no answers.&nbsp; The straw that broke the camel&#039;s back was that I could never figure out how to export my own public key.&nbsp; It is the simplest of things, but my setup just wouldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I could send encrypted messages, but never receive them, because I could never send anyone my key.&nbsp; After an infuriating message from the developers saying that, since I&#039;m supposed to upload my keys to a keyserver, I should really never have to send anyone my key, I just decided to abandon my MacBook Pro.&nbsp; I only use it for clearnet stuff now.<br /><br />I have an amazing desktop PC that cost me $2,300 to build last year, and Gpg4win works like a dream.&nbsp; See below for my public key info.
