				Hello fellow consumers, I haven&#039;t been on silkroad lately due to a good street supply in my area. Thought I will give it a look and what surprised me the most was the bitcoin prices went sky high.<br /><br />I left about 13 bitcoins on my account, bitcoin was worth just below £3, now £5.5? Almost doubled my money, would care more if I left a bit more bitcoins but I am still happy. One question though, who the heck controls the price of a bitcoin? It is ridiculously high at the moment.

				I personally think its stupid at the moment , going up and down. There hasn&#039;t been a day where it ain&#039;t stayed a bit constant. Because i have a feeling most sellers are pegging there prices to the coin and this isn&#039;t good for the buyers. And even those pegging to the dollar it&#039;s not exactly a reliable currency either..<br />For your question, the price is caused by the demand..

				it is impossible for the price to be &quot;constant&quot;. it cant even be stable. it may hover around the same price area for a while, but it cant be stable. i looked at some charts, if you ask me the price is doomed to drop to almost nothing over the long run. looks like the move from 14$ to 5ish now is simply a correction of a further continuation downwards... bad for your btc..

				i wonder what the single largest legitimate user of BTC is?&nbsp; i seriously think theres a correlation between the BTC price &amp; the road;<br /><br />even 4 months ago the BTC was significantly lower than it is now.
