Detectives were waiting for him in the backyard.<br /><br />Almeyda, 31, was ordered held in custody Friday after he was arraigned on a charge of trafficking cocaine. His bail was revoked on an earlier charge of indecent assault and battery on a child.<br /><br />Bail on the new charge was set at $50,000 cash, or $500,000 surety, 100 times more than the $500 cash defense lawyer Christopher O’Leary said his client could post on Friday.<br /><br />Prosecutor Amit Singh told District Court Judge Gilbert Nadeau that the case began earlier in the week with a call from postal inspectors in Providence to Massachusetts State Trooper Paul Baker.<br /><br />Inspectors spotted a box from Aquadilla, Puerto Rico, that made them suspicious. Frankie, a police dog that works with Correctional Officer Anthony Lucca, was used to inspect the package.<br /><br />Frankie’s reaction left little doubt about the contents of the package, police said, so postal officers got a federal search warrant and opened the box. They allege it contained a kilogram of cocaine.<br /><br />They called the state police to arrange for a delivery.<br /><br />“The package was addressed to Noel Valentin,” Singh said. The address was for Noel Almeyda’s home, police report.<br /><br />“There is evidence, in this new case, of a false name, an alias, being used,” Singh said. “There is a flight risk.”<br /><br />Singh requested bail of $150,000 cash.<br /><br />A discrepancy with the name of the person the package was addressed to is a reason to set lower bail, O’Leary argued.<br /><br />“This was addressed to Noel Valentin, 285 Sunset Hill, Riverfalls,” O’Leary said. “That is not my client.He doesn’t know anything about this package. He wasn’t expecting it. He thought he was signing for a neighbor.”<br /><br />Given that, O’Leary said, Almeyda should have a chance to secure his release on bail.<br /><br />“The $150,000 cash is just beyond his reach,” O’Leary said. “He said he thinks he can call family members and come up with $500.”<br /><br />Nadeau revoked Almeyda’s bail on the indecent assault charge that was filed in July. Almeyda had been free on bail while awaiting trial on that charge.<br /><br />If Almeyda resolves that case, or if he appeals the bail revocation and gets bail resumed, he would have to post an additional $50,000 in cash to get released on the new charge.<br /><br />The new charge is a felony that must be prosecuted in Superior Court.<br /><br />A conviction on the charge of trafficking a kilogram of cocaine carries a penalty of 15 to 20 years in prison.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				A good chance to dissect what he did wrong<br /><br />Choosing a name that is a different last name and the same first name, it&#039;s like what a 1st grader would do; especially the name Valentin, I bet he used that name around town because he thought it sounded cool or something, it just sounds fake; I think the best option is changing your name slightly ie: john smith to jon smith or john smit or something<br /><br />Also he ran; pretty much says I know I&#039;m guilty and I don&#039;t wanna get caught; and considering the amount he was shipping he should have known they would post someone on the back, it&#039;s pretty much standard procedure for big busts; just putting your hands on your head and laying down would be best, take the fighting in court, then you at least have some deniability, and no charge for attempting to escape<br /><br />on a side note, I wonder if it was his first time or he had already been doing this awhile before getting caught

				I don&#039;t think people can learn too much here but here is the morals of the stories that I got, most are a duh:<br /><br />0. NEVER SIGN FOR A PACKAGE. I know it&#039;s a lot of money but now it&#039;s also a lot of time. I put this at 0 because if you don&#039;t know this you need to leave NOW. It can be hard to refuse it on the spot and lose your $ and goods to say &quot;that&#039;s not mine&quot;, or &quot;I&#039;m not expecting anything...&quot;, and they are convincing but you have to say NO! When will people learn to not do this. <br />1. Use a fake name (notice, it&#039;s this lawyer&#039;s main argument, however see #2)<br />2. Don&#039;t us a stupid fake name<br />3. Do not order large enough amounts to make it worth their time<br />4. Do not buy ridiculous quantities of cocaine internationally (or from PR)<br /><br /><br />Also, choosing the same name and a different last name can work. Once, for women. Women get married and it happens all the time, however I would never use a combination of fake AND real name (uness it was a missed single letter), especially with stupid names.<br /><br /><br />If you choose

However, in this case,<br /><br />“There is evidence, in this new case, of a false name, an alias, being used,” Singh said. “There is a flight risk.”<br /><br />Perhaps they searched his computer and found evidence that the man had kept a .txt that had his SR name/password, among others? One that said &quot;SR- user- nvalentin2011 pass- ilovetheknickssomuch,&quot; along with some PMs regarding transporting the coke out of town. Or perhaps they found fake I.D. at his house, with applications for apartments out of state and &quot;Valentin&quot; as the applicant. I think the most likely answer is that computer technicians found something on his computer that implied he wasn&#039;t going to live in Sunset Hill forever.

				To me this suggests the POSSIBILITY that signing alone isn&#039;t enough to establish sock solid possession or intent.&nbsp; They seem to be making a big deal out of the fact that he ran.&nbsp; Yes, charges might still be there in any case, but what member of a jury wouldn&#039;t sign if he were told there was a package for him?&nbsp; Everyone likes surprises!!

				Obviously he made huge mistake with the large order from a known drug importation country. <br /><br />Running was a bad move. Made him look more guilty. You want to look perplexed as to why the cops r in your home. Then say nothing.<br /><br />The fake name was amateur hour. By the way, don&#039;t think the fake name wasn&#039;t the reason the bail was so high. Notice the charge he was already on bail for. Bet anything that is the real reason.<br /><br />This guy was a perfect example of how to be stupid.<br /><br />Another thing no one mentioned was not nowing your mail man. If someone different delivers your mail don&#039;t answer the door.<br /><br />Be aware of your environment. Be sensitive to anything that does not feel right.<br />
