				I saw that the URL for the silk road on a tor director I often use was listed as 3wavqui2mpklpcn5.onion rather than ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion -&gt; was that a phishing attempt?<br /><br />And if so, what&#039;s the best way to navigate here if you&#039;re starting from something like TAILS where you won&#039;t have access to bookmarks?<br /><br />unrelated question: what email services do people use for interacting with SR, or is it usually exclusively done via SR&#039;s PM system?<br /><br />Additional question - are these forums frequently down? I feel like half the time I come to look there&#039;s nothing around...<br /><br />Thanks!

				You keep TAILS on one partition, which can be sized just big enough to keep the TAILS distribution.&nbsp; On another partition, on the same USB flash drive you have TAILS on, you keep the Linux version of Truecrypt and an encrypted volume created by Truecrypt.&nbsp; In that volume you keep all your bookmarks and everything else you want hidden, such as a backup Bitcoin wallet. When you&#039;re running TAILS you switch to the partition that has Truecrypt and unencrypt your sensitive data, such as the real SR address, passwords, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or you could switch to Liberte Linux which must be unencrypted at startup.&nbsp; It keeps a large encrypted volume for persistent files like bookmarks and other documents you want to keep private.&nbsp; However, it&#039;s harder to use than TAILS -- there&#039;s more of a learning curve and you can&#039;t add other Linux programs like a password manager or Truecrypt.&nbsp; But Liberte Linux at least allows for the persistent selection of guard nodes, something TAILS does not do.&nbsp; This random selection of guard nodes is considered one of the weaknesses of TAILS.

				Hi CS,&nbsp; That&#039;s great information on Truecrypt thanks.&nbsp; But I&#039;m probably one step even behind dwcoe.&nbsp; How do you find the non-fishing SR onion?&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie, but I&#039;m doing my homework: <br />- MITM attack means I can&#039;t trust my ISP or the TOR Exit node to Destination therefore encrypt<br />- Using TOR means Destination can not track back to me or my terminal<br />- TAILS means I have a amnesiac terminal to run<br />- Any point to point communications to &quot;trusted&quot; people must be encrypted<br />- ** Still about to research BitCoin and multiple wallets and how to get money into them<br /><br />But to the point: If I search TORDIR for SR I get two listings.&nbsp; Are both of these valid or is one phishing?<br /><br />If I use the link TOR2WEB and not the .onion I get a head banner saying only use the .onion otherwise I&#039;m not protected.&nbsp; Okay, I understand that.&nbsp; But it also says to not trust &quot;Hidden Wiki&quot; (which lists two different SR links - presumably a phishing site if the TOR header is to be believed).<br /><br />Also, Wikipedia lists SR&#039;s .onion as *ulzz.onion (which is the same as one of the two listed in TORDIR).&nbsp; Can this be trusted?&nbsp; I would have thought this the first and easiest to corrupt by a phisher.<br /><br />Can someone confirm my side observations please :<br /><br />- Worst case scenario: If I only use an SR account once and upon transaction release BCs to trusted sellers immediate, then it doesn&#039;t matter if I&#039;m phished in SR (if I only use encrypted external TOR PM to communicate to sellers outside of SR).<br /><br />All help greatly appreciated.<br />

				There is only ONE Onion address for SR. As to &quot;how do you find the non-fishing SR onion?&quot; There&#039;s an easy way to get to the legitimate site if you are already here -- the Silk Road Forums.&nbsp; Look through the postings on the SR Forums and at the bottom of some postings, especially the postings of veteran sellers, you&#039;ll see a link to their SR profile.&nbsp; The root address of that link is the address of SR:&nbsp; http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/<br /><br />Better yet, copy the address of SR and any other links you have a hard time remembering to a file &amp; then encrypt that file.&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally, &quot;Using TOR means Destination can not track back to me or my terminal.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately, that&#039;s not always true.&nbsp; There are all sorts of attacks on Tor that have been made over the years.&nbsp; If you do a search for ways to compromise the anonymity of Tor you&#039;ll find all sorts of research papers that show it can be done, sometimes with very few resources.&nbsp;
