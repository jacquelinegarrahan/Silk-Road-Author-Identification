If 4 days pass and your order is still &quot;processing&quot;, the cancel button becomes active and you can cancel the order yourself with your bitcoin refunded to you immediately. (might be minus a SR fee?)&nbsp; Once your order has been shipped and is &quot;in transit&quot;, you have 17 days brfore the order will auto-finalise and release the funds to the vendor. NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! If this does happen, it will affect your &quot;purchasing stats&quot; which could affect your ability to buy things on SR&nbsp; Ten days after your order is &quot;in transit&quot; (I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s 10) and you are still to receive your item, you&#039;ll get a PM from SR Admin telling you to click &quot;Resolve&quot; and send the order to the Resolution Center. Here your given the choice of either extending the time frame out to receive your order, which could be a few days to a few weeks in some cases, or requesting a refund, either partial or full (you enter a percentage). Once you have made your choice, the vendor will be sent what you have requested and they can either agree and accept the resolution offered or reject it. If the vendor and you can&#039;t reach a suitable resolution and your basically butting heads, SR Admin will step in, look at any evidence to support your claims and then make a fair and equitable decision based on the facts available to them. Just be aware that some deliveries can literally take weeks. I&#039;d always start by extending the time out for your order to arrive as this solution has always worked for me on the few occasions I&#039;ve used the Resolution Center. :)
