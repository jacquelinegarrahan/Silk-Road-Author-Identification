				While i am not personally concerned about any java script that left cookies identifying IPs, reading about the whole Freedom Hosting arrest left me wondering:<br /><br />1. I use tails, and have not accessed my tormail account(s) in a while, at least a month. Problem is, I am not exactly sure if there are any messages there that *may* contain sensitive information. I would like to delete all my tormail accounts, but have been cautioned against trying to access tormail. would it be reasonable to try and access tormail when its running using the non-java method? is there any possibile way that any of my messages could possible be accessed if say a government agency decided to try and go through user e-mails? <br /><br />2. is the ICEWEASEL browser that comes with Tails the same as Firefox? <br /><br />thanks for any responses

				Basically yes. Debian changed the name to Iceweasel due to licensing problems where they made some small modifications and couldn&#039;t call it FireFox anymore. It&#039;s the exact same thing almost.<br /><br />It&#039;s too late to delete anything. All that info is archived 2 weeks ago. Everybody should&#039;ve expected tormail to be a honeypot, or run by incompetent kids anyways and always used PGP. <br /><br />The exploit only affected windows users because it made specific windows API calls. Tails not affected, would&#039;ve just shown your fake hostname, and exit IP address if it worked anyways.

				Yes, Iceweasel is basically the same thing as Firefox. If you go to Help-&gt;About, you&#039;ll see that it&#039;s from Mozilla and uses the same version numbers as Firefox. The Iceweasel that comes with the latest Tails is 17.0.7.<br /><br />That said, someone running Tails would not have been affected by this exploit because the exploit was only for Windows. Also, the version of Iceweasel bundled with the latest version of Tails isn&#039;t vulnerable to the flaw being exploited recently.
