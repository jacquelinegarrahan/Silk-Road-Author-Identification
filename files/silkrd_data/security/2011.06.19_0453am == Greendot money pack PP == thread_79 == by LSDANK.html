				Was wondering everyones opinion on maybe paying with one of these like giving the dealer the code or activation needed if thats how it works, and he will get his funds straight to his paypal . no name is needed to purchase just a 5 dollar fee i believe. Anyways let me know what yall think..

				Well, I didn&#039;t get what you wanted with paypal now, but I can tell you it sucks already and isn&#039;t secure.<br />Now, Greendot is even worse. A dealer that needs to cash out a lot of these puts himself at high risk, LE can determine where it was cashed out and in fact, you are recorded on CCTV everytime you cash out.<br />This may be near to acceptable if it was a one-time thing for a small sum, but its pretty dangerous if you do it as a regular dealer often.<br />imho either use Bitcoins or Pecunix.<br />Greets, M

				Some atms don&#039;t have security cameras.&nbsp; Also if you have GreenDot re-loadable debit cards you load the MoneyPaks onto those and never use Paypal.<br /><br />To obtain a GreenDot card for this type of withdrawl you need to register one to a drop location with a Name and SSN not associated with you.<br /><br />Many people accept payment this way, just not many people on Silk Road.

I have a Anon GrenDot Card and I will be the first vendor to accept this form of payment on this forum. <br /><br />Also, I know this is an ancient thread but in response to what Modoki said. Nobody is encouraging anyone to use a GreenDot Card with there REAL INFO. That would be insane and also retarded. I clicked on the link you posted and the kind of GreenDot ATM we are reffering to is:<br /><br />&quot;Underground ATM cards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly increase the security of centralized E-currency &quot;<br /><br />not<br /><br /><br />&quot;Reloadable Debit Cards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOT SECURE - DO NOT USE (EVER!)&quot; <br /><br />When it is not in your name it becomes underground ATM. This is a great way to cash out money and is 100% secure. I know people on other forums who have been cashing out GreenDot MoneyPaks for years and are still running anonymously. The key is that you have to get the card in another name and SSN and not your own.

				I have always wondered about greendot.&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw a post either here or somewhere else where a guy said it wasn&#039;t and he made some pretty good points...i just don&#039;t remember them at the moment lol.<br /><br />Seems at least more secure than WU or MG as far as receiving unless you send a bum in everytime but then you gotta dump the dudes body which adds extra time to it all.
