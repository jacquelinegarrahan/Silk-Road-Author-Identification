				I I were to move to the country, where the pop density would be infinitesimal compared to any medium-sized city, and I were to continue using Tor, I suppose I would stick out like the proverbial sore thumb to my ISP, with any consequences (or not, as the case may be). <br /><br />Therefore, how would I to go about disguising my use of Tor? Would the simultaneous use of a VPN do that, and if so, how? How would I implement it? The Tor site cautions against using a VPN simultaneously with Tor because you could make things worse IF YOU DON&#039;T KNOW WHAT YOU&#039;RE DOING. I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to make things worse for me (in the case I were contemplating moving, that is). Being hypothetical here.<br /><br />Any suggestions?

				use a bridge? even if the bridge is in the middle of nowhere its not your nowhere. That and SSH tunneling though I&#039;m not sure what sort of footprint ssh tunnels have

I am not sure what SSH tunneling is, since tor doesn&#039;t need SSH in hidden services. But to access the clearnet, yes. Still, I wish I could find out how to do a VPN at the same time as tor.

				You can try using a bridge relay. These are entries into the Tor network that aren&#039;t published, so in order to tell that you&#039;re using Tor, an ISP (or other interested party) would need to keep an updated list of all bridge relays.<br />[clearnet]<br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#RelayOrBridge<br />[/clearnet]<br /><br />It&#039;s been my experience though, that as long as they don&#039;t get complaints about you, ISPs don&#039;t really care what you&#039;re doing. I&#039;d especially avoid using bittorrent, or other illegal streaming or files sharing services, as that&#039;s a lot more likely to get your account/IP addresses flagged than using Tor is.

				Hi Soyyo,<br /><br />I feel for you buddy, I&#039;m based in the Isle of Man (LEO no doubt are furiously trying to trace me as we speak!) and it&#039;s quite easy to see from the network map there aren&#039;t many people who use Tor - it is feasible to track someone down in this way which is why I add a few bridges to my Vidalia every day. Please let me know if you need help getting this set up, it&#039;s very easy.<br /><br />V.
