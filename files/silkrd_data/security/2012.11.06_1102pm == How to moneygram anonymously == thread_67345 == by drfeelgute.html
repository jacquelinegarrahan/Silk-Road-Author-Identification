				Omg that freaked me out.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t prepared for it and gave some personal information.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to worry too much about it as it was a small amount and I&#039;m just an occasional small buyer, but is there a way to do it anonymously?&nbsp; Moneygram or otherwise?&nbsp; I&#039;m really missing the bitinstant cash through Wellsfargo which they said is down until Dec. 1st in the least while they update their computers - no doubt the LEO is behind it imo.

				For sure LE is behind it.&nbsp; Really pisses me off.<br /><br />Where did you go to do the moneygram?&nbsp; I think if you&nbsp; go to a Check Cashing place and not have to show an ID most of the time.&nbsp;

				Pretty certain if it is under $800 you are not required to show ID. I&#039;ve made three payments with MG and not once had to show ID. The last time was with a totally useless woman and she asked for ID right at the end, told her I didn&#039;t have one and she was fine with that.<br /><br />Make sure you have a fake name, address, phone number and birth date ready. Don&#039;t stress out and wear a cap if you can. <br /><br />If they get curious about who you&#039;re sending it to you can either say: <br /><br />1. none of your business or<br />2. a friend out of town/overseas who is stuck for money<br /><br />If you are sending a different currency make doubly sure it is sent in a currency of the recipient. <br /><br />Check out how many MG places there are around your area and go to a different one each time. I am not sure if each one shares information with the other - this will have implications on the fake name and other details that you give. <br /><br />Try not to stress next time.
