				So I ordered a medium size amount of mdma from a vendor on the site that has been on here 9 months and has amazing packaging from germany. The 1st couple arrive over a 2 week period. <br /><br />I then ordred one package one day, then the next day ordred another. So now both of those packages have not arrived. My biggest concern at this point is that I made a mistake in using dwolla and the police could have got the packages and got a warrant to check my accounting info. I read where one guy on here claimed that happen to him and they kicked down his door waving wire information. Needless to say I am thinking I am being over paranoid. But why would 2 packages not making it after I have had SEVERAL make it thru. <br /><br />I have a 3rd on the way. What would you guys do? Would you do a reship or ask for a 50% refund. At this point I have no clue whats going on and overly paranoid. NOt keeping anything at my place. Now using BTC much more intelligently. If it was one package I would not be so freaked but 2 ... just very weird becuase I really trust this vendor so I do not think it is on his end. <br /><br />

				How long has it been since ordering that second batch? I&#039;d feel the same way as you, overly paranoid no doubt. But you did a smart thign so far, clean up and leave no traces. Prepare for anything, but try your best to stay calm and get as much information on other people&#039;s similar experiences / PM&#039;ing the vendor you purchased from if they might have info as to anything going wrong. Use that paranoia-rush to research and stay a step ahead of the game. I understand your situation and how you feel, just think of whatever you can do to 1) make yourself feel calm/comfortable&nbsp; 2) be prepared in case this situation turns into a worse-case scenario; such as how to speak to LE (which is basically not talking at all lol), lawyer info, etc.<br /><br />But No.2 is just so you can be prepared and not get caught off guard. I wouldn&#039;t worry about worse-case toooo much yet.<br /><br /><br />And side topic: Just curious Limitless, is it not smart to order too much at once? The obvious answer I would think is yes because it draws less heat clearly. But as for me man, it&#039;s damn difficult to wait a week or worse, TWO weeks, when some much wanted listings may get taken down / just the extra wait to receive, etc.

What is the vendors stats like? I suggest you start having things shipped to different addresses and clean house.

				Vendor has great stats, nothing is in my house at all and my entire computer is encrypted. <br /><br />So you think I should just get a 50% refund instead of doing a re ship?

				I don&#039;t know mate, these things are hard to call when the vendor is a playa. It&#039;s not my place to say because I don&#039;t know the situation. Do what you think is fair and right.

				Just an FYI, if you&#039;re buying different products, it doesn&#039;t matter much, but say you order a gram of coke from seller A and a gram of coke from seller B, how do you know who to finalize when the first one shows up? If the second one never arrives, now what? This happened to me and I had no idea who to finalize for the one I received.<br /><br />I messaged each seller requesting the state they ship from stating the postmarks showed the state anyway, and I stated why I was asking. I didn&#039;t what to appear suspicious and get my handle blackballed. Turned out both were from the same state so I was no further ahead. I finalized both hoping that the other package would show up late but it never did. I suppose it was the price I paid for that lesson. Better off ordering one thing at a time.<br /><br />
