				so the other day i feel that i have done everything necessary to FINALLY make a purchase on SR and i have a couple hundred bucks so hey i figure lets get it done i inspected what site i was gonna use to buy bitcoins understood the concept of bitcoin adresses wallets how the transaction goes down so i go to mtgox(most suggested site from what i&#039;ve heard)and i look at payment methods to buy bitcoins......yeah....and i sit there for like 10 mins like.........what in the fuck.....i&#039;ve never even heard of any of these payment methods....as much as i could sit here and complain about how they wont accept a credit/debit card or paypal im just going to ask this question:<br />what is the best(easiest)way to buy bitcoins(to get money into the account so i can actually make &quot;bids&quot;on coins)<br />mind you i&#039;ve never even heard of the payment methods that i saw listed so be very specific please on steps to essentially get money onto mtgox so i can buy bitcoins with it in turn(easiest way)

				Well, keep in mind that the easiest way is often not the best way. You of course want to do it in the most anonymous way, which might require you getting off your ass :) That is, making a cash deposit to an account at a local bank branch in order to get your Bitcoins anonymously.<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert though and have not used Mt. Gox, am only familiar with the cash deposit system of CaVirtEx.
