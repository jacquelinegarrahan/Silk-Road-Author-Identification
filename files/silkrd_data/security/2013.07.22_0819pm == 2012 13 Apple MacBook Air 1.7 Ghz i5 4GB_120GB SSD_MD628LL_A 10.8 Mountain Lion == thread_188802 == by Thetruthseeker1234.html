				So what is the most secure way I can set up:<br />2012 13&quot; Apple MacBook Air 1.7 Ghz i5 4GB/120GB SSD/MD628LL/A<br />10.8 Mountain Lion<br /><br />Someone help me please, I am about to purchase a vendor account and start selling some crucial products on the road.<br />I happen to be under a good amount of heat and I want both no chance of my customers ever being in jeopardy or myself. On the day the police bust in and confiscate my laptop, I want to be 100% sure they will have no way of getting in/accessing the information on it.<br /><br />I can offer 100 tabs of tyl3r durdens legendary 1200ug 25i tabs as payment to whoever helps me. Or I can offer 5$. Your choice.<br />Free help is also always appreciated.<br />Thanks all

				My advice to you would be to ditch MacOS in favor of Tails. <br /><br />However, you will probably have a hard time installing Tails on you MacBook Air, as it doesn&#039;t have a CD drive, and Macs don&#039;t like booting anything thats not MacOS from USB drives. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend using a different machine to vend on SR (sorry. I love my Mac too, its not not the best tool for SR purposes). Maybe you can pick up a cheap laptop on craigslist or at a pawnshop?

My friend got a new $400 toshiba and it works just as good as my 4 figure macbook.<br /><br />You can probably find a used toshiba, just like new for $200. I would look into that and then post the version you are looking at in here.<br /><br />As far as the internet anonymity stuff, I am in the same boat.

Figure out how much it cost and come back here with the model and all and we will give you a good to go.<br /><br />You should be able to find a good used computer on eBay. Look at a couple and search for their reviews to find the best value. I would get a Toshiba.<br /><br />Your call

				Really any PC will do. One is not more secure than another. When you are running Tails they are all equally secure. I think the only consideration you will have is the RAM. You will need a descent amount, as Tails stores a lot of info in RAM. I&#039;m not sure exactly how much RAM you will need, but I&#039;ll guess that info is readily available.<br /><br />I would just get the cheapest possible machine with at least the required amount of RAM. And go ahead and pick up a USB stick while you&#039;re at it (at least 2GB) so you can set up a persistent drive. There&#039;s a great Tutorial by Fallkniven on how to do this.

I need to be way over protected. If the police bust in, there needs to be no chance of them ever breaking into my machine.<br /><br />Someone was telling me I should also run tor through a VPN. If someone can tell me what that means that would be great. I have no idea what a VPN is.

I doubt they will be able to connect my one purchase anyway.<br />For example, if someone on here says they are about to go to a certain festival, is that a security risk? Obviously no, because there are a large number of other people who would also be there, making it impossible to know who the person is.

				To do this you&#039;re going to want a 2 USB sticks and a PC. Load tails onto the first USB using the PC(http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/). Then when you start your mac hold down the option key, or download an RFID(it&#039;s what selects what to boot, your mac os, or tails) or it&#039;s called something like that. I&#039;m not sure. <br /><br />Now you have tails on your mac. To get persistence use the USB installer in TAILS to install the next one with persistence. A USB with persistence won&#039;t boot on a mac so you need to use both to boot with persistence.

				Keep us updated, @Thetruthseeker1234. I&#039;m curious to see if you are able to get Tails up and running (w Persistent Drive) on your Macbook.<br /><br />I was not able to get my Macbook to boot from the USB drive no matter what I tried. I&#039;m always interested in others&#039; success stories, though
