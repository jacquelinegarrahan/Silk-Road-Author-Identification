				I&#039;m having a problem with Tor.<br /><br />When I start it, there&#039;s a notice of a security update.&nbsp; When I got to the TorProject download page, I see that the latest version is the one that I&#039;m currently running (tor-browser-2.3.25-2_en-US).<br /><br />I tried &#039;New Identity&#039; several times and I still get the notice to update TBB.<br /><br />I then ran the executable to unpack to see if that made a difference, and the security update notice disappears after the first time I run TBB but then reappears every time after.<br /><br />Can someone help me out here?&nbsp;

				seen that too if you look at there blog <br /><br />it says that there i guess was a update before of a newer one then 2.3.25.2<br /><br />it was a 2.3.25.3<br /><br />and it says that its not safe and that they have changed all the downloads to a downgraded version for security .. <br /><br />so the one ur running is ok .. <br /><br />the one with the 3 at the end is the one that u dont want.. i think they put that up so that people running the newer one downgrade.. to 2.3.25.2<br /><br />

				Ok im a little bit confused. Also saw the update notice, I don&#039;t see it when I open TOR but only when I open a new tab and click home.<br />When I try to see what version I&#039;m using from the Vidalia control panel all I see is 0.2.3.25<br />cant see a 2 or 3 at the end so I&#039;m not sure which one I&#039;m using, have downloaded the update (tor-browser-2.3.25-2_en-US) but did not install.<br />Is there another way to check my version? and what the correct one is I should be using. Forgive my stupidity. Think Ive done the right thing by keeping the bundle I&#039;m on now?<br /><br />Just checked the TOR blog and it seems there is a new one posted Feb 22nd - Tor Browser Bundle (2.3.25-4)<br />Not sure what to do.<br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />From the blog:<br /><br />Very important: if you&#039;ve been using the Tor Browser Bundles with Firefox 10.0.x, you must not attempt to overwrite it with the new bundle. Open these into their own directory and do not copy any profile material from older TBB versions.<br /><br />I am using firefox 10.0.12, so that would mean I need to delete TOR all together and install this new one if I was to update to 2.3.25-4 ?<br /><br />I usually give these things more thought without asking but I&#039;m sick and stressed out at the moment, from various other shit.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really all that critical, provided you don&#039;t use the TBB to surf the web as your usual, everyday browser.&nbsp; The version of Firefox ESR that the Tor project distributes as part of the bundle jumped from 10.x to 17.x -- about a year&#039;s worth of fixes, etc..<br /><br />Again, personally I don&#039;t think it matters too much as long as you don&#039;t use it regularly.&nbsp; I did see something about rolling back an update to OpenSSL libs or something or other though, which is definitely disconcerting.&nbsp; Usually you don&#039;t downgrade something unless there&#039;s a pretty serious hole.&nbsp; I&#039;m also clueless about this &quot;can&#039;t use any of your old profile&quot; thing.&nbsp; Makes very little sense to me, but it&#039;s their project... they should know, right.

				Check out the blog on the Tor site for specifics. The short of it is that they posted a new release too early and it wasn&#039;t quite ready. <br /><br />It now appears that all is fixed with the latest release so simply download it, erase the old version, and install the new one.<br /><br />No worries.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)
