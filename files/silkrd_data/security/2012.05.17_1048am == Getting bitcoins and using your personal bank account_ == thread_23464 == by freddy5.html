				Ok, so I&#039;m pretty damn confused about dealing with bitcoins at the moment. I have an account with one bank and seldom use it. I&#039;m not sure at all if it&#039;s even a good idea to use it for transferring money to mt.gox, as that would leave a trail back to me, correct? But then I need SOME account to deposit money, correct or no? If no, then I just walk into a bank and tell the teller I would like to....what exactly? Are most banks familiar with bitcoins? <br /><br />&nbsp;For those looking over this thinking &quot;what a noob, moving on&quot; please help as it would be a great favor to me. <br /><br />EDIT<br />-------<br />In case the above does not make sense, let me try again. So let&#039;s say I got $100 and want to get x amount of bitcoins for it. So I set up a mt.gox account first, but now I need to deposit the money through some bank. My bank is vystar. Do I go there or do they even recognize bitcoins? If not, what banks shall I consider going to? Do I have any buisness going to these other banks considering I do not have an account with them? If it doesn&#039;t matter, exactly what do I say to the teller?<br /><br />Yes I am a dumbass but I also do not deal with banks all that much and don&#039;t know what to do in this situation.

				If MtGox allows real world cash deposits at a bank then you do not actually have to be a member of that bank to deposit cash into their account - you just go in with the cash and the reference number etc.<br /><br />But if you want to transfer money from your bank then obviously that speaks for itself. Tbh the first option is probably safer but if you&#039;re buying personal amounts I really wouldn&#039;t worry it. Then again other people on this forum would tell you opposite. You can buy coins from mtgox then put them through bitcoinfog if you really want to anonymize the entire process.

				No you would not use your bank, you would use the bank of mt gox. Check out the FAQ at mt gox, they should say how to do it. But basically you would go to lets say bank of America, say I want to deposit money into a account. You don&#039;t need to be a member of that bank. Just fill out the form with the info mt gox gives you. Give them cash and your done the money will get to mt gox.
