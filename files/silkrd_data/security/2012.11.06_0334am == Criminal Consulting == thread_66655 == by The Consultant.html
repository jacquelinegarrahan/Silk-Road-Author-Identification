				Title: <strong>Criminal Consulting</strong><br />

				[This is a copy of a thread I posted in Product Offers, but since it IS a discussion topic, it makes sense to put it here too.]<br /><br />Hey there Silk Road!<br /><br />I&#039;m The Consultant, and that&#039;s just what I plan to be. I&#039;m not a seller yet but I want to know if you&#039;re interested in my service before I go any further. My specialty is thinking, contemplation, and analysis. Therefore my service is doing that for you, for basically anything. The main one I have in mind though, is crime.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve got a crime in mind but no idea how to carry it out, or you want some advice, come to me! I&#039;ll sort you out. Any crime you need done, I&#039;ll tell you how, and I&#039;ll see about putting you in contact with people to help you... with the hands-on work, if required.<br /><br />Crime isn&#039;t all though, I&#039;m also open to consulting you on pretty much anything. Anonymous, of course, I don&#039;t want to be creeping your life or anything, but I&#039;m happy to help someone in need of some counseling or whatever. I&#039;m a good person to talk to, honest; I can&#039;t count how many people I&#039;ve talked out of suicide for goodness sake.<br /><br />Why crime then? I&#039;m bored. Bored bored bored and life as it is isn&#039;t interesting enough and I&#039;m not going to commit crime myself but I definitely have the mind for it. So instead, I can help you commit yours.<br /><br /><br />What do you think, sound like something you&#039;d buy in to? It would be free at first, of course, but after that I&#039;d charge for it.<br />Let me know what you think! Thanks a lot. :)<br /><br />- The Consultant
