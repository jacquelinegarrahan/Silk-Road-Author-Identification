				blockchain.info is currently down because of a DDoS attack, according to their Twitter page. Just sent a bunch of coins there, hope everything is OK. You can&#039;t access any part of the site currently, they say they are working on it. Just passing along the info!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m absolutely dumb struck that the price of Bitcoins hasn&#039;t dropped to nothing over the past 48 hours.&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s almost unbelievable to me.&nbsp; If they can survive this... fuck it man, I&#039;ve got to seriously consider going all in or something...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the info :)<br />

				blockchain.info has a very popular BTC wallet that many people use.&nbsp; They used to have a btc mixer service as well,&nbsp; but it is my understanding that they discontinued that recently.

				The mixer still exists but it&#039;s called a &quot;shared&quot; address now. It&#039;s under the Shared tab of your receiving addresses.<br /><br />They also lowered the fee from 1.5% to 0.5%.

				If they are getting DDOSed, it&#039;s probably only their front-end that will be affected.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they would have place their BTC daemons right on the same server hosting the wallets and everything.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about your BTC transactions to them.
