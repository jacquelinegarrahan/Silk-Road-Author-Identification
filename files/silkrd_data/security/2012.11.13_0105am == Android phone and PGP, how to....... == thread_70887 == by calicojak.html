				Yeah. Check out AGP (PGP keys) and Orbot (Tor).&nbsp; Standard Google Play store, or market, or whatever the fuck they call it now.

				Also get Orweb. It&#039;s like the tor browser, while orbot is simply the tor service.

Create a key with it or use Kleopatra on your desktop to export your key, then import it from your sd card or something.

				Er, thanks Berry.&nbsp; Yeah, APG.&nbsp; Not AGP (nope, can&#039;t download accelerated graphics processors from Google after all.<br /><br />You can download them anywhere. They&#039;re .apk files.&nbsp; Then sideload them by going into your device&#039;s options and enabling &quot;non-market installations&quot; or whatever in developer options, then execute the .apk file on your android device.

				SS is right, you can download the .apk elsewhere and sideload them onto your device. I use android commander (PC program) to install all of my apks whenever i flash a new ROM or download a cracked app/game.<br /><br />However, creating a fake gmail account and attaching it to your phone for the sole purpose of downloading apps is fine, and much less of a hassle.<br /><br />While we&#039;re on the topic of android security, what other apps are out there? The OS is pretty secure on the iteration i&#039;m using (JB 4.1.2) but some extra security measures/ways to lock down the phone would be nice/

				Honestly, none that I know of.&nbsp; I mean I tried Lookout (the antivirus) for like a week after one of those &quot;did you receive a text?&nbsp; ZOMG YOU HAVE MALWARE!&quot; scares after I first got the phone.&nbsp; Was just irritating.&nbsp; Like most of them.&nbsp; Removed it, never had a problem in 2 years of an android phone.<br /><br />I do use Droidwall though.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a GUI interface that uses &quot;iptables&quot; to change the kernel&#039;s firewall behavior (just like you&#039;d use &quot;iptables&quot; on any Linux box -- android uses a modified Linux kernel if you didn&#039;t know).<br /><br />Edit: think you have to be rooted for Droidwall.

				Who wouldn&#039;t want their phone rooted? It&#039;s generally very easy nowadays for most devices and there&#039;s no reason not to!<br /><br />Not really interested in antivirus, that has literally *never* been an issue and I used to download a bunch of cracked apps. I go to the right sites.<br /><br />Thanks for the suggestion with Droidwall, I&#039;ll check it out.

				Shit, I just realized that Droidwall would probably fuck up Orweb or Orbot.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;ve never used either. I&#039;ve got Orbot, but... I&#039;ve &quot;got&quot; every cool piece of software I find for this thing, ya know.<br /><br />I know torify or torsock or tsock (or all of the above) count on Linux rerouting the packets at the kernel level to function.&nbsp; That&#039;s what Droidwall is manipulating.&nbsp; Just wanted to be sure to point it out before somebody did something they were uncomfortable being in the clear.
