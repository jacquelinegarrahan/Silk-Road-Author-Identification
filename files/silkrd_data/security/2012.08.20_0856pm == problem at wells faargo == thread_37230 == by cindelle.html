				went to purchase bitcoins through bitinstant using wells fargo. a ritual i practice very regularly. easy to do, i can even use the drive through. this afternoon i again, used the drive through, when the teller told me that there was an alert on the account i was trying to deposit into. she told me to hold on and she got a supervisor. after waiting about 5 minutes (felt like an hour), she came back and told me everything was ok and that the deposit went through. when i asked her what went wrong, she said that she had no idea, but that she had to get a supervisor to over ride the transaction. i know there have been issues with wells before, but i just wanted everyone to know about my experience.

				had the exact same thing happen to me today<br />every detail you just shared --- the teller called someone first though and then got the supervisor<br />but they came back and cleared it<br /><br />no idea what to make of this -- anyone else ever seen this happen or have any insight?<br /><br />maybe it&#039;s just a standard audit or something on the &#039;middleman&#039; agency that&#039;s handling the account? <br />i went to their website later that afternoon and noticed some peculiar things about their home page<br />maybe they had been hacked somehow?<br /><br />seems like it&#039;d be one of those type of things<br />

				Happens all the time, nothing to worry about it&#039;s just an automatic flagging by the system and tellers don&#039;t really have any permission other than to withdraw/deposit money (if you think about it most of them are young). I&#039;ve had supervisors get called for deposits, withdraws, transfers, etc. I do shit bricks every time the teller smiles nervously and says &quot;hang on one minute&quot; and then leaves to get the supervisor. The paranoia kicks in and I&#039;m thinking &quot;Just run, they&#039;re calling the feds!&quot;

				Heyo folks, <br /><br />I&#039;m obviously new to the forum as you can tell by my post count but I&#039;ve been lurking SR for a week or so now. All of my trepidation is because of how unsure I am regarding getting USD into BTC and onto SR safely. The whole idea freaks me the hell out for obvious reasons. Do you mind explaining your processes of going Wells Fargo --&gt; BTC --&gt; SR? For me, it seems to be the closest process as to how I&#039;d like to proceed since there are tons of Wells Fargos around here. <br /><br />Also, is there a universal place to see what the BTC exchange rate is as of today? I looked a few days ago and it was like 12:1 BTC:USD but then I was lurking again yesterday and ran into a conversation saying that it went down to 7:1 over the weekend?

				I would use MP&gt;BTC with a trusted vendor, sure you lose some money but hey it&#039;s fast and anonymous. Us vendors lose money to cash out too so I figure if we lose money to stay anonymous so should buyers&nbsp; :D

				the entire idea of being on camera at a bank that has very long and regulated rules on keeping image and transaction data sounds horrible.

				I agree that the idea of being at the bank physically has issues that come with it<br />But frankly, that&#039;s how I learned to get on here and make things work<br />I use cash deposits (NO room for electronic deposit for BC) and then get BC from Mt Gox<br /><br />For me this is how it works - might be better to do the drive up thing but I think you&#039;d still be on camera - only then it would include your car&#039;s info if they can see the tag.<br /><br />Back to the topic though -- it&#039;s good to hear that others have seen this and haven&#039;t seen anything come from it<br /><br />I can understand how there could be several possibilities that could lead to an account being &quot;flagged&quot; but when it happened....it was worrisome<br /><br />Noting else occurred though --- instant override and no further info was requested of me<br /><br />I have both a local BOM and Wells F option for cash deposit and have been varying my routine between the two<br /><br />Might be time to switch back to BOM for a little while<br />&nbsp;:-X

				i speculated on another thread that the FLAG might be due to some withdrawal or transfer restriction that had to be put on thanks to scammers. i do not know, it was an idea.<br /><br />and yes nothing illegal about buying BTC. if you get screwed though, being on cam buying 1,000s of btc 2 weeks before u get busted with 50 kilos won&#039;t help your case legal or not.&nbsp; :-X

				good point about the timing thing<br /><br />which makes me wonder if BC purchases are tracked and prioritized the same way most drug enforcement activities seem to be<br /><br />i.e. -- small purchases aren&#039;t that big of a concern given limitations with LE staffing / resources ..... <br /><br />I think we&#039;d all be guessing to try and figure that out<br />But it makes me want to search this site for more historical conversations on how people think LE might be out there trying to counter TSR <br /><br />After all, I don&#039;t know if there is a truly 100% anonymous way to go about this.<br /><br />I think you have to hope to some extent that small transactions aren&#039;t going to be at the top of anyone&#039;s priority list for tracking/stopping<br />&nbsp;???<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
