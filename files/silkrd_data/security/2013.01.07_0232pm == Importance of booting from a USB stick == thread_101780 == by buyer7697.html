				I&#039;m wondering how important this really is.&nbsp; The only thing they would find on my computer would be a link to TOR browser and Windows GPA.&nbsp; No incriminating evidence is on my computer.&nbsp; Would LE even bother going through my computer for a QP of weed, especially given medical marijuana is legal in my state.&nbsp; Is there any risk signing onto my SR account on other peoples computer using the tor bundle?&nbsp; Thanks for any info

				You don&#039;t have to use a boot USB.<br /><br />You can use truecrypt to encrypt a USB drive.<br /><br />Then you can download gpg4usb. http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/<br /><br />And you can run TOR from the USB.<br /><br />As long as your truecrypt password is good you are set to go.

				Thanks for the replies, there would be literally no evidence to find, except maybe vendor keys but they can&#039;t do anything with that. I provide weed to under 5 people and none of that is discussed over a computer.&nbsp; There is nothing linking my SR name to anything else on my computer.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m just overly worrying, wife says if I go to jail for this shit she isnt visiting lol.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to convince her (and myself a little) that nobody goes to jail for a few ounces of weed, no priors, upstanding citizen besides pot and the occasional mushrooms.

				if you&#039;re paranoid about keeping logs in the first place, use a laptop or computer with no hdd, and only run off a live CD. usb has hardware serials that may potentially be identifying, but still an unnecessary risk altogether. use random wifi if possible (this would require a laptop) and evade cctv. <br /><br />

I anticipate unless you are an arms length from computer when the door goes flying off the hinges, you won&#039;t be able to do much with your computer. I like the idea of a cheap laptop and using random wifi although I&#039;ll have to see how that works around town. I bought a laptop off ebay for $90 refurbished that I installed Ubuntu, Tor, Truecrypt, and have USB with GPG4USB on.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t taken the hard drive out but I guess I could if preferred - anything else I&#039;m missing?

				It has been said before, but I see you have only 10 posts.<br /><br />When you use T.A.I.L.S. , you will find no evidence on your computer al all !!!<br /><br />No need to take the hdd out and so on.<br /><br />Gpg4usb and T.A.I.L.S. , that&#039;s all you&#039;ll need to stay out of reach of L.E. agentcy&#039;s

				You can use Full Disk Encryption on Windows, OSX, or Linux. With a secure password this means that as long as your computer is powered down when the raid comes then none of the information on your computer will be accessible.<br /><br />I would say that yes there is a problem logging onto SR with someone else&#039;s computer. That computer could have a keylogger or other program installed on it which could steal your information. Since you don&#039;t own and control the machine you can not be sure it is safe.<br /><br />The best use of a USB would be to load Tails on it. You can use that at home to keep your computer completely free of any SR business, and you can use it on a friend&#039;s computer to be reasonably sure any viruses they have will not cause you harm. Tails is sort of the dumb-simple way to be super secure, and it works for almost any situation.
