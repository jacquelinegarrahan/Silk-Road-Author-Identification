What private browsing does is to: <br /><br />Private Browsing - Browse the web without saving information about the sites you visit<br /><br />As you browse the web, Firefox remembers lots of information for you: sites you&#039;ve visited, files you&#039;ve downloaded, and more. There may be times, however, when you don&#039;t want other users on your computer to see this information, such as when shopping for a birthday present.<br /><br />Private Browsing allows you to browse the Internet without saving any information about which sites and pages youâ€™ve visited. This article explains what information is not saved when in Private Browsing and gives you step-by-step instructions for using it.<br /><br />Warning: Private Browsing doesn&#039;t make you anonymous on the Internet. Your Internet service provider, employer, or the sites themselves can still track what pages you visit. Private Browsing also doesn&#039;t protect you from keyloggers or spyware that may be installed on your computer.<br /><br />What does Private Browsing not save?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Visited pages: No pages will be added to the list of sites in the History menu, the Library window&#039;s history list, or the Awesome Bar address list.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Form and Search Bar entries: Nothing you enter into text boxes on web pages or the Search bar will be saved for Form autocomplete.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Passwords: No new passwords will be saved.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Download List entries: No files you download will be listed in the Downloads Window after you turn off Private Browsing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cookies: Cookies store information about websites you visit such as site preferences, login status, and data used by plugins like Adobe Flash.

The money is held there, in trust, to pay the vendor for your purchase.&nbsp; After you have received your goods, and are satisfied, you click on the Finalize button to release the funds from escrow so they can be moved to the vendor&#039;s account. <br /><br />Under normal circumstances, transactions are auto-finalized 17 days after being made.&nbsp; This means that you have 17 days to receive your&nbsp; goods and finalize the transaction; if you do not dispute the transaction (i.e. go to resolution) the money will be automatically released from escrow and sent to the vendor after 17 days have elapsed.&nbsp; If you stil have not got your goods by say, 15 days, you can use the resolution feature to have the finalization date extended. <br /><br />To finalize early means to release the money from escrow BEFORE receiving the goods. Finalizing early is discouraged, as it can be used as a means to scam the buyers.&nbsp; Read the buyer&#039;s guide on the main Silk Road site for more information. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />You might also want to&nbsp; look at the Seller&#039;s Guide: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide<br /><br />

When you get your product, you &quot;finalize&quot; it. Then the seller gets the money. It automatically finalizes after a certain amount of time if you don&#039;t finalize.
