				I don&#039;t understand...how does Localbitcoins seem shady? They have an escrow system, feedbacks on the BTC vendors. It&#039;s actually a lot less risky than buying BTC say from SR vendors.

				Coinbase, LocalBitcoins (although I find most of the prices to be outrageous), or BitcoinTalk forums. Latter is the easiest IMO.

				BTC Quick is also a viable option...since the whole BitInstant debacle I have made accounts with a couple different bitcoin providers to ensure I have access to a readily available supply of bitcoins whenever I need them.

				I traded with Jumbomonkeybiscuit a little while ago<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/75803901ae<br /><br />But now they are only trading with people who have at least 3 transactions with them....<br />&lt;sadface&gt;<br /><br />Hopefully they&#039;ll resume their service for anyone in the next few weeks.&nbsp; Completely trustworthy anonymous cash-in-mail professionals!&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a priority flat-rate envelope or box go missing so I dove in with confidence.

				See my post and the rest of the thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188755.msg1365135#msg1365135<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to take it seriously but it should make you think.&nbsp; Extend the same type of scenario to bank transactions.&nbsp; As one user suggested, you might want to think about burner phones and disguises.&nbsp; And, I suppose, leaving your car a few blocks away - backed in of course, to avoid the plate scanners on many cop cars these days.&nbsp; I would only go that far if you are making purchases in the thousand $$ range.<br /><br />Hopefully MoneyGram &amp; Western Union are a little more anonymous (but you are still having money delivered to a known and flag-able entity somewhere, possibly LE, and in front of a camera).<br /><br />I still think the safest route is the reload type card.&nbsp; You are paying cash at a gas station or Walmart checkout line.&nbsp; The pin is unknown to anyone until you scratch it off (again we hope).&nbsp; There are still cameras of course but, presumably, no flags that would alert someone to review the footage.<br /><br />The down side is that LBC vendors usually charge more for reload cards.&nbsp; They don&#039;t always have listings up.&nbsp; The max amount is fairly low.&nbsp; Some of them still want you to do SMS verification or tell them what zip code you purchased from (avoid).<br /><br />Food for thought.&nbsp; In the end, yes, this whole process is a huge pain in the ass.&nbsp; Less pain = less anonymity, just as The Man intended.
