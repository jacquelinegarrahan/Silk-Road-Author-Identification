				Never let Law Enforcement in the Door.&nbsp; I know this and still I caved like a wimp.<br /><br />Today, I&nbsp; &nbsp;Was burning, and got a knock at the door.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the State DEA.&nbsp; <br /><br />They smelt marijuana and they wanted in.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I made the mistake, I let them in when they did not have a warrant.&nbsp; Maybe I thought they would go easy on me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They where not there for me but someone else in the building.&nbsp; &nbsp;They where in Full bullet proof gear, I surrendered:&nbsp; 4 oz of Ecuodr, 1.5 oz of Texas Psilocybin, 18 grams of Kush, 7 grams of Bubba Kush, and 5 grams of Mephedrone (bath salts).&nbsp; They laughed at me, and said they where just looking for the person downstairs but since their here theyll take it.&nbsp; &nbsp;They wrote my name down said they call me.&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; well see.&nbsp; they took both of my scales.&nbsp; &nbsp;WEll see if any more trouble comes.&nbsp; &nbsp; Im officaly on vacation from the road.<br /><br />They left me my bong and and a almost empty jar of weed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I My friends got plenty more so im all set anyway when it comes to smoke, and I know someone who is getting some more cubes soon.<br /><br /><br />

				Wow I wanna move to your city, Never heard of any leo none the less a DEA agent who lets someone go, who is in possession of a Schedule 1.<br />If I were you I would check everyday to see if they have issued a warrant for you or you could get a notice to appear in court.

In an upper middle class to upper class neighborhood in a liberal state? They don&#039;t care so much. In a lower class or lower middle class city in a republican state? You are probably fucked. In the south you are probably fucked times ten. Being white helps a lot also. So does being older.

				ah, this reminds me of a time when i was smoking(chronic) in a three level apt. building. i was on the second floor. after smoking a J, i became a bit worried that the neighbors upstairs could smell it. became paranoid, a few minutes later an unexpected ring came from my doorbell. became even more paranoid. could not see out the peep-hole as it was covered with some decoration, could not peek out the window because of the close proximity to the door. so i was frozen there for a bit as the doorbell rang again, no one announced them self&#039;s, so i just waited and waited until finally they left the building. i was still too paranoid to do anything for a while, so to make a long story longer i will just suggest that you do not answer unexpected rings or knocks on the door. <br />yes. it was good chronic, purple, i believe. ;D<br /><br />oh yeah, to quote NWA. &quot;fuck the police!&quot;

				I&#039;ve been wondering, does anybody know EXACTLY what to say to a cop/fed if they knock on your door? I&#039;m sure they&#039;ve been trained to strong arm/ manipulate you into cooperating, and can even break a few people even if they know you aren&#039;t supposed to talk to the police. <br /><br />So what exactly do you say? They knock on your door, ask if they can come in, and then you say &quot;am I free to go&quot;? That doesn&#039;t really make any sense. <br /><br />Do you say &quot;Am I under arrest&quot;? <br /><br />If they say no, do you say &quot;I don&#039;t volunteer any information and don&#039;t consent to a search&quot;? And then they have to leave?

				Not sure how the law works where you are but over here if you don&#039;t answer the door (and they DO have a warrant) and they kick the door down, then unless you are unable to pin a single thing on you, the cost of repairing the door is on you - surely the last thing you want to be worrying about if they have just grabbed your stash and arrested you? I<br />That being said if they don&#039;t have a warrant (or the laughably named &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;) to get in feel free to send them on their merry way!<br />Also door jamb armour or similar may give you the extra time to loose any incriminating material around the place, assuming you keep a lot of it around.

I know several people who&#039;ve had their doors knocked down / forcibly entered with no warrants or any suspicion at all other than the police wanted to get in.<br /><br />A friend of mine who grows weed has a pitbull that&#039;s nearly the size of a human (body size, not height lol!) and whilst it&#039;s really really really soft and wouldn&#039;t hurt a fly, it likes to bark and is scary if you don&#039;t know it. Law enforcement now won&#039;t enter his house on &#039;health and safety&#039; grounds.<br /><br />My own front door is solid steel along with the frame, which is bolted into the foundations and walls by about a meter using more steel core. The letterbox, bell and handle are connected to the mains electricity supply which I can active remotely using a system I purchased in South Africa, all my ground floor windows have steel bars over them on the outside and inside and the upper floor ones aren&#039;t large enough to enter by. I have a server protection system fitted in my entrance hallway which instantly fills the room with potentially toxic argon and carbon dioxide gas if the door is forceably opened.<br /><br />I suppose you could get in by taking the tiles off the loft but the police aren&#039;t the SAS so I&#039;m not concerned.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing things but I have better things to do.
