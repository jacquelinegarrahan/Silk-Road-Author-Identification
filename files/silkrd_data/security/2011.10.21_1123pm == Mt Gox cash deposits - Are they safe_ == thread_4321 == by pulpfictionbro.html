				Are they safe? You need to be a verified acct for which you need to provide them with 2 forms of id but it says on their website that they wont share the info with anyone unless subpoenaed by the Supreme court of Tokyo (they are Japan based btw).<br /><br />From their website, <br /><br />&quot;Any information submitted is subject to Mt.Gox&#039;s privacy policy and as such will not be shared with any 3rd party, corporate partner, or agency external to Mt.Gox under any circumstances. Documents collected via this form will be accessed by Tibanne&#039;s staff only. Please note that we will only release your information if we are subpoenaed by the Supreme Court of Tokyo.&quot;<br /><br />So is it safe to provide them with your id? I mean it might not make sense for the sellers because they have a lot more on the line but the buyers should be safe right?

				As long as you wash your coins a couple time before sending to SR and you&#039;re dong under $10,000 I highly doubt you will run into any trouble<br /><br />(You can use any exchange or online wallet to wash your coins, foreign ones are better because they are a pain in the ass for the feds to order around)

				Mt Gox deleted the deposit link to the old Morpheus, and now is using a new form of cash deposit. They are fairly professional, but when they make a mistake, other than the hack they experienced, they are very rigid and inflexible. They run an increasingly stable and professional exchange, but unfortunately, are becoming as bureaucratic as a bank. Maybe that&#039;s the price you pay for a scalable exchange of &quot;last resort&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4321.msg36088#msg36088">Quote from: pulpfictionbro on October 21, 2011, 11:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are they safe?

				Took them 72 hours to credit all pending Chase cash deposits instead of 24 as stated on their website. I say proceed with caution.
