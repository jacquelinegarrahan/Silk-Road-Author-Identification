				Well it looks like the worst just happened. Lost 300BTC into cyberspace from a simple transaction from SR to my bit wallet :(<br /><br />I wonder how this sort of stuf happens. My BTC address is always checked before confirming...

				Every bitcoin transactions is very traceable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you not look up the transaction information on blockchain.info?<br /><br /><br />

				That sucks man, hope you are able to figure out what happened and get them back.<br /><br />Along this line, I&#039;ve always read that doing like an instawallet-instawallet-SR&nbsp; was always a really good amount of security as is.&nbsp; Is blockchain really necessary?&nbsp; I understand it adds (more) security but is it more for people dealing in huge amount of BTC?

It does NOT specify a BTC address to which you withdraw to. <br /><br />This is rather unfortunate. Makes me want to disable my SR vendor account. <br /><br />And to answer the guy above me, Ive always used blockchain as my BTC wallet.

				It makes me more comfortable that SR isn&#039;t keeping easily accessed records of withdrawal addresses.&nbsp; Hopefully, they don&#039;t keep them at all after they use them, but they probably have to to document that they sent out coin for a withdrawal request.<br /><br />Seriously, you guys should keep your withdrawal address around until your transaction is confirmed on the blockchain and by the receiving wallet.<br />

				Update: Emailed SR support team, and they gave my the BTC address to which i withdrew to, and its correct how I wrote it. <br /><br />So my question is, does SR hold withdraws and release them in a specific time frame?

				I did a withdrawal with what was left in my buyer account, and it showed up in the blockchain in less than 120 seconds.<br /><br />If you have the withdrawal address, look it up on blockchain.info (using Tor) to see if the transaction occurred.&nbsp; If the transaction is not there, then ask SR why it is not.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is there, then you should figure out why the money left your wallet, which may indicate your wallet is compromised.&nbsp;
