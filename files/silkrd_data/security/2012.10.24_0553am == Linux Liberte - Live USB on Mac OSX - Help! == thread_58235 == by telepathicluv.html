				I have been doing insane amounts of research - and because I am not well-versed in computer code- much of it has been hard to understand. But what I do know from searching the liberte support forums, as well as the forums here, that there has yet to be a good explanation to the problem I am having. I am not the only one who has had this&nbsp; problem, but no answers have been forthcoming.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, I am using a mac and trying to run liberte from a live usb. I have extracted the .zip file on the usb, formatted to FAT 32, but the problem comes in opening the setup.bat file. On the liberte install page, it only gives directions for linux and windows. I have seen people state online that they have successfully booted liberte this way, but what is the next step I need to take?&nbsp; How do I launch setup.bat ? Thanks!!

				You need to download the image file and &#039;restore&#039; the image to a partition (or the whole thing) on the USB drive... not use the .bat file setup.<br />.Hades.

				If you extract the .zip file directly to the USB, you don&#039;t need to run the .bat file. Just make sure that the liberte files that extracted from the .zip are in the top level of the USB (i.e. they&#039;re not inside of another folder), and you should be good to go. Hold &#039;option&#039; when you&#039;re starting up, and you should be given the ability to choose the liberte USB. I found that choosing &#039;framebuffer graphics&#039; was necessary in order for it to load properly, and if my cursor went to the extreme right of the screen, liberte would freeze, but YMMV.<br /><br />Basically, just follow steps 1 &amp; 2 on the liberte &#039;install&#039; page, and you&#039;re in business.

				This is how I got it working.<br />Extract the zip to fat32 USB. Then run the .bat file from the usb on Windows from an elevated command prompt.<br />That;s it then hold option and when booting the mac and it works good.

				for some reason it doesn&#039;t show up when I hold option when the computer reboots.&nbsp; I have tried using the terminal, and this is what I got: <br /><br />username$ dd if=/Users/username/Downloads/liberte-2012.3.iso of=/dev/disk1<br /><br />435472+0 records in<br />435472+0 records out<br />222961664 bytes transferred in 292.355265 secs (762639 bytes/sec)<br /><br />I also tried mounting the image file directly using the &quot;restore&quot; function in disk utility and that didn&#039;t work either.<br /><br />any other ideas? what I am missing??

				Looks like your missing the EFI boot on the disk. Did you run the bat file from the usb stick on windows?

				The USB drive you &#039;restore&#039; onto also has to be formatted w/ a GUID Partition Table, not Master Boot Record (which is typically default). You can change it by opening up Disk Utility &gt; selecting the drive &gt; choosing the &#039;Partition&#039; tab &gt; Setup your desired partitions/sizes/etc &gt; hit &#039;Options...&quot; and make sure it&#039;s GUID. :)<br />.Hades.

				man, I have tried about everything on the internet, including rEFIT, unetbootin, CCC, manually entering DD code, etc... with rEFIT and unetbootin, I am able to see the linux penguin come up in the boot menu. but then, when I open it, it says it will autoboot in 10 seconds, and then starts the 10 second cycle over and over ad infinity...&nbsp; so if I can figure this out maybe this will work...<br /><br />as far as windows, will I be able to set up my usb stick using the setup.bat file and then be able to return to my mac with linux ready to go? If so, I am ready to try that option! thanks! any other ideas?<br /><br />I am currently trying dd again after partioning according to guid...

				is your mac 2011+? If it is refit and other linux bootloaders will not work, you need to use EFI. Did you try what I said with the boot bat file or what? I&#039;ve said it like 3 times now, use the .bat file on windows which loads the EFI bootloader which will make your stick work on mac and windows machines.

				upsman, as soon as I get a chance I will try a windows computer - I just don&#039;t have access to one everyday, but it sounds like that will be the best thing - although if I can&#039;t do that I might have to settle for a virtualbox liberte install inside a truecrypt volume. I am on virtualbox right now, that is the only way I have been able to access liberte so far.

				Yea trust it works like a dream on macs and windows desktops..far superior than using a VM. You could spin up a quick windows VM in osx to do the install.
