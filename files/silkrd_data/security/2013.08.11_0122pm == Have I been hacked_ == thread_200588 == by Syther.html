				Hey, so long story short I was going through my startup programs and looking through services etc and I noticed something to do with media player (I&#039;m running vista) that I don&#039;t use, so went into media player to change a setting after probably months, if not years, of not using it.<br /><br />As soon as I open it I see 4 pictures are listed in there, alone, that are from my backup pictures of my iphone. The pictures are of the general (shitty apple GPS) location of my cannabis grow site that I screenshotted incase I forget the way and couldn&#039;t find them again (it&#039;s in a forest) - not just random pictures.<br /><br />Now, I haven&#039;t used media player in months atleast as stated, so how have these pictures got there? Have I been hacked and how can I tell if I have? Kinda worried here as I wouldn&#039;t count myself as an advanced user.<br />Thanks in advance for replies! :)

				So let me see if I understand this correctly... you have a personal computer that you&#039;re running vista with, and you noticed four pictures on it of your grow operations that include geo tagging from your iphone.&nbsp; You&#039;re confused because you don&#039;t know how those four images got into your media player there?<br /><br />It&#039;s just my impression that you may have forgot that you uploaded them there or emailed them to yourself, or something.&nbsp; Maybe it was on a thumb drive or maybe you selected something to share all media.... not sure, but I don&#039;t see how or why a hacker would place four photos of your grow operation in your vista media player.

				Yes you are correct.<br />I know I know, it&#039;s most likely me just forgetting I&#039;ve done something - but I just can&#039;t understand why they would be there? Especially those specific pictures.<br />I&#039;ve never sent them to anybody and certainly not used media player for anything with them. How would I tell if it was indeed a hacker?<br /><br />Edit: I just realised that it&#039;s showing each picture as being 1.9GB each, of being type &#039;PNG&#039;, and having a different outlined-5-star-rating for each of them. I just can&#039;t understand why?

				Turn off photostream on your iphone.

				For what reason?<br />And the location where the photos are is where I backed them all up manually, not from photostream.<br />Also strangely the 4 photos obviously aren&#039;t next to eachother in the folder they come from.

				Media player probably just indexed your drive so you can find stuff quickly.<br /><br />Turn off photostream if you have an iPhone and are taking pictures of illegal shit, because it&#039;s transmitting your pictures wirelessly to Apple, storing them in the cloud, and sending them to any device you have iTunes\iCloud enabled.

				You shouldn&#039;t be taking photos of your grow operation or geotagging it anywhere.
