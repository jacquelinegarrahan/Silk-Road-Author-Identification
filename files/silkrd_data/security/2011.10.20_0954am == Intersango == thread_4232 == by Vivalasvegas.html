				Hello all, this is my first post and I am a true SR and Bitcoin newbie. <br />Yesterday I opened an Intersango account (formerly Britcoin) and tried to walk into the UK bank that they use and deposit a small amount of cash. The bank tellers looked at me weirdly after they punched in the Bank Account details and stated there is no way you can deposit that money over the counter. My own bank electronically transferred it but said it will take 2 days. Why can you not deposit it in personally? Any help will be appreciated.

				@Dorito- I am not really sure why you think I am a scam site from China or that I posted the same question 9 days previously but i assure you you are wrong and I am a genuine person who finally found SR after tinkering around with my computer to figure out how to get there. This is a GENUINE question from a GENUINE person and not a scammer!!

				Was this HSBC you walked into? If it was I can understand however I deposited £40 into their Lloyds account in person, with cash, no ID so I&#039;m not sure why you had trouble. Try another branch?

Lucky for you that you did not join up on October the 19th. It took me about a month of ping pong emails with Intersango to get my money credited.<br /><br />All in all life is simple for you and myself now with Lloyds. Rememember the whole Bitcoin thing is is a new currency that most banks would not advocate. It is only a matter of time for us to both have problems again:( Then welcome to my past pain.

				...that shouldnt stop you being able to deposit cash into one of their nominated accounts unless they knew that the Bank a/c &quot;name&quot; was related to intersango and that intersango were britcoin..<br /><br />
