				http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/2779644/Internet-drug-trafficking-skyrockets-experts-warn.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">STOCKHOLM (AFP) â€” Drug trafficking on the web has soared as Internet use has become commonplace, presenting far more challenges and dangers than traditional trafficking, experts warned at a conference in Stockholm that wrapped up Wednesday.<br /><br />&quot;Buying drugs on the Internet is really easy. You only need an Internet cafe, a credit card, and it&#039;s done,&quot; said Daniel Altmeyer, an Interpol officer attending the World Forum Against Drugs in the Swedish capital this week.<br /><br />While he said there were no available statistics, drug sales via the Internet have skyrocketed in the past few years.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a new kind of audience, helping new people to try many new things,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Internet drug buyers are primarily people under the age of 30 who are open to new experiences and are web savvy. On the Internet they have access to websites, forums and chatrooms where a link that can provide them with illegal drugs is only a click away, Altmeyer said.<br /><br />&quot;You feel safe because it&#039;s anonymous,&quot; said Krister Gaefvert, a police inspector in Sweden, a leading country in the fight against Internet drug trafficking.<br /><br />&quot;There&#039;s this feeling of being anonymous behind your screen... It doesn&#039;t always feel illegal,&quot; he added.<br /><br />His colleague Cecilia Fant noted that drug trafficking via the web was almost perceived as &quot;a white-collar crime. There&#039;s no more Pablo Escobar with handcuffs behind his back.&quot;<br /><br />But the anonymity of it all presents a big risk.<br /><br />&quot;With traditional trafficking, you knew your dealer, you knew where the drugs came from. Here, you don&#039;t know anything,&quot; Gaefvert said.<br /><br />A traditional dealer might also provide information on how much of a certain drug to take.<br /><br />But on the web, &quot;you can find out what effect a product will have on you, but not so many people have accurate information on what quantity you should use. It&#039;s very dangerous,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Prescription drugs -- &quot;as dangerous as hard drugs&quot; when used without a doctor&#039;s recommendation -- represent about 90 percent of the illegal substances sold on the Internet, according to Gaefvert.<br /><br />The web has become a perilous minefield for pharmaceutical products, the experts said.<br /><br />&quot;You find a lot of products with some comments from fake specialists and photos of people wearing a white lab coat. The purpose is to look very serious, just to make the client think that he&#039;s not doing anything illegal,&quot; Gaefvert said.<br /><br />Synthetic drugs such as amphetamines and ecstasy, as well as cocaine, cannabis and heroin are also easily available via Internet.<br /><br />It is difficult for law enforcement authorities to have an overview of web-based drug trafficking.<br /><br />&quot;The crime doesn&#039;t take place in the machine,&quot; Altmeyer said, noting that the computer was just a communication tool.<br /><br />&quot;A website may be hosted in Sweden, but the drug will come from Latin America and will be shipped by boat to South Africa, with dealers spread out across Europe. It&#039;s a global network,&quot; he explained.<br /><br />In addition, narcotics legislation varies from country to country so one product may be illegal in one place and not in another.<br /><br />Altmeyer cited the example of ketamine, an anaesthetic often used as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties and which is legal in a number of countries including India.<br /><br />&quot;If I find this website in India, even with the best laws in Sweden, Germany or the United States they can send me as much ketamine as I want by post,&quot; he said.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
