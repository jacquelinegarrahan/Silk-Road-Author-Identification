				this is new to me you need a verified account to withdraw to a bitcoin address? do i literally have no other option but to get my account verified or is there a way i can send the money somehow and get the money to my SR account? here i was thinking it would be smart to buy coins and send them there first while the site was down..

				that&#039;s what i thought since i&#039;ve done this once before but everytime i try it says &#039;Your account is currently pending review, please visit https://mtgox.com/forms/verification&#039;<br /><br />i did try to get my account verified a while back but it was rejected.. form i sent was too old.. problem right now is even if i wanted to get my account verified idk if i could because my current address isn&#039;t the same as the one on my drivers license..

				They haven&#039;t changed anything as far as I&#039;m aware.&nbsp; I know you can get flagged for suspicious activity and they will have you verify.&nbsp; Have you contacted them?&nbsp; This is interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on this thread.

				Have you accessed Mt.Gox through TOR?&nbsp; That is known to flag you until you get verified, they don&#039;t like TOR access.&nbsp; Regarding your documentation, old license address doesn&#039;t matter, mostly a recent utility bill or something is fine at your current address.<br /><br />Good luck

				Mt. Gox can ask you to verify your account for absolutely no reason at any time; this is stated in the terms &amp; conditions which you should have read prior to trading on their exchange.<br /><br />On March 13h, 2013, Mt.Gox revised their BTC withdrawal limits:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Mt.Gox Support Desk</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Due to recent events in the Bitcoin community and the spike in the Bitcoin price we at Mt.Gox are putting in place a new daily withdrawal limits. While our daily limits for traditional currencies will remain unchanged with a maximum of $1,000 USD per 24 hrs, the Bitcoin daily withdrawal limit will change from 200BTC to 100BTC per 24 hrs for unverified customers. Verified and Trusted customers that already have their daily/monthly limit raised will not be affected with this change, however, Verified and Trusted customers that hare not yet asked for their withdrawal limit to be raised will then be offered the following limits :<br /><br />Verified Status (Level 1) Maximum monthly withdrawal of 50,000 USD (or equivalent) capped to a maximum of 10,000 USD per 24 hrs and a 1,000 BTC withdrawal per 24 hrs without any monthly limit.<br /><br />Trusted Status (Level 2) Maximum monthly withdrawal of 500,000 USD (or equivalent) capped to a maximum of 100,000 USD per 24 hrs and a 10,000 BTC withdrawal per 24hrs without any monthly limit. Of course we will re-evaluate these limits and adapt and revert them to their past value if necessary and if the value of Bitcoin against USD decreases.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As mentioned above, you can normally withdraw up to $1,000 USD per day without verification, but can only withdraw 100BTC per day (so be careful if the value falls below $100.00 USD per BTC), and accessing Mt.Gox through Tor will get your account flagged for verification.<br /><br />Libertas

				i too had a nasty experience with gox. unverified, using tor... i even went to make a second account forgetting i made a first one. made the mistake of putting 7 bitcoins into the account, then discovered that they wouldn&#039;t let me have it back.<br /><br />as far as i&#039;m concerned, SR users should shun gox. bitstamp does not act prejudicially against tor users. the cloudflare loadbalancing service they use occasionally puts up a torwall but i have not been treated like a second class citizen for having used tor to access my account.
