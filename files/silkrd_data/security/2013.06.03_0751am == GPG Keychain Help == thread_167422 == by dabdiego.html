				Hey guys, <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if this question has been answered a hundred times, but I&#039;ve looked through a bunch of material and also consulted many guides... none of them seem to answer the question in a way I am able to understand, if at all. I have installed GPG Keychain for Mac and have went through the whole generating a key bit. I have three different keys up on my screen, two of which are RSA and one of which is DSA. I am confused as to how I am able to view my public and private keys associated with these. I am trying to get this down before opening my vending profile to the public tomorrow. Obviously I need to be able to post my public key, but also would like to know that I understand how to decrypt them with my private key. Again I am very, very new to the receiving end of PGP messages, any help you can provide will be very much appreciated. +1&#039;s to anyone who helps&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Dabdiego

				I understand what your saying, even reading everything, it can be hard to wrap your head around it. So you have GPG Keychain, I&#039;m not sure that is the same as GPG Tools, its on the same site but the downloads look different.<br /><br />Go to this clearnet link and download GPG Tools:<br />https://gpgtools.org/installer/index.html<br /><br />Okay a little about encryption, you do not need your own key.&nbsp; Down the road you may need a key if you ever want a seller or someone to send you something encrypted but for the most part what you will need is a sellers public key.&nbsp; You take the key of a seller you want to use, you import the key into your gpg tools then you type out the information you want to encrypt, encrypt that information using the sellers public key, then send the encrypted information to your seller. <br /><br />Here is a clearnet link to a video showing you the process.&nbsp; The video shows how to encrypt inside a text editor with a few clicks, its about 2 min in. <br />https://gpgtools.org/screencast.html<br /><br />In the event that you do make your own key with gpg tools, then that key will consist of 2 parts, a public and private part.&nbsp; When you copy your key, your copying your public key, someone can use it to encrypt messages for you.&nbsp; Your private key part will stay on your computer and is only used to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your public key.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope this helps, please note that none of this is from me, I got all this information from the SR Wiki, even the links were there. So be sure to read up remember everything you need to know is here on the wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

				I only mean to say that if you&#039;re doing illicit things in which your communications need to be secure/private, you should probably know a little bit about the methods you&#039;re using to make them so. If I come across as heavy-handed or not constructive, I apologize. It&#039;s not my intent. Perhaps I was reacting a bit to your &quot;mac users&quot; comment ;) Cheers, mate!

				Sorry, but I really am attempting to learn this stuff. I understand that I need to know how to use it, that&#039;s why I&#039;ve posted asking for help. Unfortunately I don&#039;t think I am explaining myself well enough. I have my key generated, I am able to view all of the information on it including the short id, the key id, and the fingerprint. I guess my questions are this. <br /><br />1) what forum do I use to actually message. There doesn&#039;t seem to be any place for me to write or copy/paste an encrypted message as I guess I assumed there would be. That&#039;s great, but that leaves me to wonder how I am able to input my encrypted message that has been sent to me. <br /><br />2) I am having quite a go of it trying to figure out how to get my public key (the one that is pasted in my vendor profile) so that I may forward it to buyers. I have tried to export it to the key server but can&#039;t seem to find it there in subsequent searches. <br /><br />Again sorry these are probably really dumb questions. I have never been good at this stuff but am very interested in learning as I don&#039;t see myself as having much else choice. Beyond that it really is interesting to me. I would really appreciate it if anyone else had any thoughts on what I might be missing. <br /><br />Also for those worried about my safety, I am using a mac because it is my second computer that I have available to dedicate solely for this purpose. I am in the process of clearing everything off of it but am doing this while also attempting to put up a vendor page and gauge interest on the forums, it is a full time job to say the least. <br /><br />Anyways, thanks again for any guidance you might be able to provide&nbsp; :)
