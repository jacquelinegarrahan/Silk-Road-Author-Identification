				Hey everyone, on Friday I tried placing my 3rd order(25c), but unfortunately it didn&#039;t work out. I ordered Silo&#039;s 1000microgram 25C-NBOME tabs x10. If anyone has tried them btw how are they? Anyways, the reason it didn&#039;t work out was because apparently I encrypted my shipping address with a key that did not belong to the vendor. <br /><br />I posted a thread here yesterday, and then tried sending him an encrypted messege with my shipping address, but his public key posted on his page would not import when I clicked certificate import(I use Kleopatra). I went into configuration settings and everything and did something that I can&#039;t remember, that was supposed to help it, but it didn&#039;t. I tried looking him up on the servers, I typed in silo, a list of a bunch of variations of the name showed up, with a plain silo at the top. I clicked his name, clicked import, and it showed up on my certificate manager but the name was red. I&#039;ve succesfully sent encrypted messeges to &#039;&#039;Righteous&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;Frylexa&#039;&#039;. Can someone maybe remind me how to import a new vendors key on kleopatra since I think i&#039;m fucking up somewhere, please?

If you run into a situation like this, please stop immediately and ask for help! Please do not change any settings, and flail about trying to fix the problem -- believe me, you will only cause more problems than you solve. <br /><br />As far as the keyservers go, a lot of vendors do not post their PGP keys to the keyservers, so the odds of success are minimal. The absolute best place to obtain a vendor&#039;s key is from their SR vendor page, or here on the Forums, if they happened to post their key here. <br /><br />If I were in your shoes, I&#039;d ditch Kleopatra, and use gpg4usb instead. You can download it from: <br /><br />http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html<br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />
