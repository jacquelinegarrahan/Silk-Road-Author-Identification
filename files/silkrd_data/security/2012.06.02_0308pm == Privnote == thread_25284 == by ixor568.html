				So I&#039;ve noticed some vendors have started using this over PGP encryption; I wanted to get the communities thoughts on this and is this a safe alternative or should I just avoid any vendors using Privnote?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; ;)

				I think pgp should be the standard, and I dont like privnote. The only problem is some vendors dont use pgp, so if you want to put in an order you have to use privnote or send your address unencrypted. Kinda shitty, but i make exceptions for certain vendors.<br /><br />I look at it this way, if the vendor is shady and possible LE collecting addresses, he could just as easily set up pgp and accept orders using it. Also if this were the case, that pgp encryption could possibly be used against you because its proof that you were the one who put in the order as only you would have the code to decrypt messages sent back to you. Theres no deniability that is isnt you if you are communicating with pgp and they are watching you. Anyone can send a privnote with you address and that could be something that saves you in the long run. <br /><br />I dont know i guess thats just how i justify sending my address with privnote, Its really nowhere near as secure as pgp, and i wish all vendors were required to use pgp, but its the nature of the beast so it really comes down to if you as the buyer are willing to take the risk.

				as a vendor I use it as a LAST RESORT I will contact the buyer 3 times about the PGP encryption not reading properly and then I will ask them to use privnote &amp; I only open the link in SR or the forums just for security purpose

				why even bother to use privnote it is just one more place where shit can be intercepted you might as well just send plaintext over SR

However after that they&#039;d only have the stooge&#039;s word for it that the Privnote contained his particular name and address as it&#039;s being deleted after being viewed (or so we are told! :-D ). Examining the problem from the other end i.e submitting my associate&#039;s name and address to Privnote on its own also gives LEO nothing as anyone could have written his address there, including himself for any reason. <br /><br />Sending a plaintext address over SR may be more secure theoretically but ensuring that people only view the address when the envelope is sent reduces the chance my customers will store it on their machines by saving an e-mail or message to their hard drives. Of course this isn&#039;t a problem if you use full disk encryption but we&#039;ve already discussed that is by no means a guarantee of safety!<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend people use it over Tormail + GPG generally but it suits my particular needs when dealing with newer clients. I don&#039;t understand why some vendors don&#039;t use GPG though, surely it&#039;s something that&#039;s covered in the Seller&#039;s Guide?<br /><br />V.
