				Summary<br /><br />1) INTRODUCTION<br /><br />2) SOFTWARES USED AND LINKS<br /><br />3) ENCRYPTION<br /><br />4) CREATION OF A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING VIRTUALBOX<br /><br />5) TWEAKS TO VBOX<br /><br />6) INSTALLING AND SETTING UP LINUX<br /><br />7) TOR<br /><br />9) SHORT INTRODUCTION TO PGP VIA THE TERMINAL<br /><br />10) ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />1) INTRODUCTION<br /><br />First of all, I&#039;m no security expert. The following guide will be nothing but technical instructions to securing your machine to make digital information storage and transmission secure.<br /><br />Your security is divided in 3 parts. Also remember your security (as in lowering chances to get caught) is only as strong and your weakest link. Those 3 parts are :<br /><br />a) Money You can (and will) get caught if you aren&#039;t careful with how you move money. Banks and LE work hand-in-hand to trace money. I won&#039;t cover that aspect but you need a bulletproof way of buying (if you are a buyer) and/or selling (if you are a seller) your bitcoins.<br /><br />b) Drugs Yes, you&#039;ll get caught if you don&#039;t handle drugs in a secure fashion, ldo. It includes shipping, stealthing, receiving packages, storing. You get the idea.<br /><br />c) Information Here is the part I&#039;ll develop in this guide. How to handle information (mostly digital information) to not get caught and be as stealthy as possible.<br /><br />2) SOFTWARES USED AND LINKS<br /><br />All the following softwares are : 1) Free - you don&#039;t have (and shouldn&#039;t, as sad as it sounds for security reasons) to pay anything to fully use them 2) Open source - Anyone with knowledge can see what the programs are made of. Def a security plus.<br /><br />We will need (In order of use) : a) a good anti-virus (exemple : AVG) b) a password manager, multi plateform recommended (exemple : KeePass) c) Truecrypt d) VirtualBox e) Ubuntu 13.04 f) Tor Browser Bundle for Linux<br /><br />a) a good anti-virus Before even starting the job, we need to make sure we&#039;re working in a safe environnement. If you have a keylogger installed on your computer then all futur steps will be for NOTHING. So if you don&#039;t have an updated AV installed yet, get one. I personally use AVG. Here is the link but it&#039;s recommended you search it yourself using google, after all, I could be a hacker myself. http://free.avg.com/<br /><br />b) a password manager You&#039;ll need to save at least 5 complex passwords. I strongly recommend using a password manager (with passwords creation) such as KeePass. It&#039;s multi plateform (windows/linux/android). http://keepass.info/<br /><br />c) TrueCrypt Very powerful piece of software which allows you to encrypt files/folder or even full system partition using bulletproof algorythm such as AES. http://www.truecrypt.org/<br /><br />d) VirtualBox Very powerful software which allows you to run a completely autonom virtual machine inside your physical machine. http://www.truecrypt.org/<br /><br />e) Ubuntu 13.04 Free OS. Very safe. Not so user friendly but you&#039;ll only use it to browse SilkRoad and use PGP (more on that later). http://www.ubuntu.com/<br /><br />d) Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) A package of pre-configured software to use TOR. Awesome. https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en<br /><br />3) ENCRYPTION<br /><br />I assume you already installed the antivirus and ran a minutious scan on your system. Your system was clean already ? Great, you can read what&#039;s next.<br /><br />So first, we want to create an encrypted folder so that we can install a complete different OS in it. It&#039;ll be 100% safe and impossible (without the passphrase ldo) to know what it is you are putting in the folder.<br /><br />1) Click on &quot;Create Volume&quot; 2) Select &quot;Create an encrypted file container&quot; 3) Select &quot;Standard TrueCrypt volume&quot; note : Do your godamn research on which option you want to use. 4) For Volume Location, select where you want to save the file. Type in a random name and click &quot;save&quot; then &quot;Next&quot; !! Note : You can select a USB pendrive (with at least 10GB and USB 3.0 strongly recommended) so that you have a portable, encrypted OS. Very useful since that you can physically hide it from LE in case of a search at your place) !! 5) Encryption Options I advise to use AES. The technology is old which, in security, is a good thing since it means it has been tested by many security experts. I don&#039;t know about Hash Algorithm. I think I use RIPEMD-160 but it&#039;s up to you to do your godamn research on which option you want to use. 6) Volume Size Pick at least 10gb, (no more than 15GB really). Note : TrueCrypt will encrypt the whole 10GB no matter what it is you put in, even empty space. So consider the number you type in (10GB here) as gone once you click &quot;Next&quot;. 7) Volume Password Open KeePass (!!!!!!!! with a strong masterpassword !!!!!!!!) and generate a random passphrase using at least 15 (25+ advised) characters (with lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols, space everything checked). Save it carefully, and copy paste it twice in TryeCrypt. 8) Large Files Select &quot;Yes&quot; 9) Volume Format Move your mouse randomly (to create randomness in the Key) a few seconds then click &quot;Format&quot;, wait. 10) Congratulation, you now are the owner of an encrypted file container.<br /><br />4) CREATION OF THE VIRTUAL MACHINE USING VIRTUALBOX<br /><br />First, you need to mount the encrypted folder you just created. For this, open TrueCrypt, and click on random letter (remember it and always use the same to avoid corruption). I personally use R: (don&#039;t ask me why, I guess I used it the first time and it stuck). Then, click on &quot;Select File&quot; and browse to your newly created folder, click on &quot;Open&quot;. Then, click on &quot;Mount&quot;, it&#039;ll ask for your passphrase. Open it with KeePass and copy past it. Click &quot;OK&quot;. If everything went well, you can know access your encrypted folder using Windows Explorer in computer. Truecrypt created a virtual partition.<br /><br />Okay, so now, off to creating a Virtual Machine. You must have downloaded Ubuntu 13.04 (700MO or so). Good, save the .iso file somwhere.<br /><br />a) Open VirtualBox, click on &quot;New&quot;. In name, type in Ubuntu, it&#039;ll automatically select the type and version needed. Click &quot;Next&quot;. b) Memory Size. It&#039;s the amount of RAM you want to allocate to your virtual machine. I personally have 12GB of RAM and I allocated 4096MO to my VM (virtual machine). Note : Consider that the amount of RAM you give to your VM gone from your physical machine. Even if you don&#039;t run anything on your VM, the amount given (4096MO) won&#039;t be usable by your physical machine until you shutdown your VM. Click &quot;Next&quot;. c) Hard-Drive. Select &quot;Create a virtual hard drive now&quot;, click &quot;Create&quot;. d) Type of hard drive file Select &quot;VDI (Image disk VirtualBox)&quot; Click &quot;Next&quot;. e) Select &quot;Fixed Size&quot;, click &quot;Next&quot;. f) File location and size For location, click the yellow folder and go to the letter you mounted the file in TrueCrypt (for me R:\the-name-of-your-VM.vdi) In size, pick whatever the amount of GB you allocated to the crypted folder MINUS 1.5GB. !! Note : very important. For exemple, if your crypted folder is 10GB, you must pick 8,50 Gio. !! Click &quot;Create&quot; and wait a minute or two for VBox to create your VM.<br /><br />5) TWEAKS TO VBOX<br /><br />Here are the settings I use for my SilkRoad Machine.<br /><br />To access settings, in VirtualBox, select your newly created VM and click &quot;Configuration&quot;. Go to the onglet &quot;System&quot; =&gt; &quot;Proc&quot;, select a reasonnable Value (where the green and red meets is generally ok). Type in 90% in allocated ressources. Go to the onglet &quot;Display&quot; =&gt; &quot;Video&quot;, select a reasonnable Value (where the green and red meets is generally ok). Number of screen, 1 by default. You can use more screens if you have more than one. Vbox supports it beautifully. Click &quot;OK&quot;.<br /><br />6) INSTALLING AND SETTING UP LINUX<br /><br />a) Open VBox, select your virtual machine in the left and click &quot;Start&quot; at the top. You now are running your virtual machine.<br /><br />Now you must install Linux on it. A window will pop up and ask you to select a booting disk. Click the yellow folder and browse to the Ubuntu.iso file you previously downloaded. Click on &quot;Start&quot;.<br /><br />You VM will now boot using Ubuntu. Install it, check &quot;Download updated while installing&quot;, leave everything else as is.<br /><br />Select &quot;Erase disk and install Ubuntu&quot;. File in the settings needed. In name, type whatever you want (note : I usually just type in the same letter I used to mount the folder with TrueCrypt). Pick a password (a new fresh password, that one isn&#039;t necessarily important but make sure you remember it). Select &quot;Require my password to log in&quot;, you don&#039;t mind extra lawyers of security. Click &quot;Continue&quot;. Now, wait, the installation can take up to an hour or two.<br /><br />When done, click on &quot;Restart Now&quot;. When rebooting, you will be asked to if you want to boot using the installation, DON&#039;T anything and wait. Now you have a beautiful orange/purple page asking you for your password. Type in the password you wrote during the installation process and press Enter. Welcome to Ubuntu.<br /><br />b) You need to setup a few things.<br /><br />First, you can go fullscreen pressing Right CTRL + F (the CTRL next to the arrows on the right of your keyboard). Better, right ?<br /><br />You&#039;ll notice those black borders onto the sides. That&#039;s ugly and bad for your eyes. To remediate, you need to install a pack of drivers especially made for Virtual machines.<br /><br />To do so, put your cursor to the very bottom center of your screen (if you are in fullscreen mode, else you have access to the options at the very top of the window). Click on &quot;Peripheric&quot;, Click on &quot;Install Guest Additions&quot;. An autorun window will open up, select &quot;Run Software&quot; and click &quot;OK&quot;. Enter your Ubuntu password. Click &quot;Authenticate&quot;. An ugly purple window will open with ugly white characters, it&#039;s the terminal. We&#039;ll use it later for different stuff. Wait a minute or two until you have the terminal says this &quot;Press Return to close this window...&quot;. Press Return on your keyboard (above Enter) to close the window, ldo.<br /><br />Reboot the virtual machine by going to the very top right of your screen. Now to go the options, on the left, you&#039;ll see a dock of icons, click the Gear with the Red hammer or whatever you call it in english (I know it&#039;s not a hammer). Double click on &quot;Displays&quot;, pick your favorite resolution. Click &quot;Apply&quot; then &quot;Keep that resolution&quot;. Much better, cierto ?<br /><br />You will notice the OS seems slow and laggy, even more so if you installed your VM on a USB pendrive. To remediate, follow those steps.<br /><br />Run the terminal (push ALT + F2 and type in &quot;Terminal&quot;, double click to open it. Copy past that command :<br /><br />/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p<br /><br />The following should appear :<br /><br />Not software rendered: no Not blacklisted: yes GLX fbconfig: yes GLX texture from pixmap: yes GL npot or rect textures: yes GL vertex program: yes GL fragment program: yes GL vertex buffer object: yes GL framebuffer object: yes GL version is 1.4+: yes Unity 3D supported: no<br /><br />As you can see, 3D acceleration isn&#039;t activated. To activate it, return to terminal and copy past those commands, enter password when asked. When &quot;asked to continue [Y/n] ?&quot;, type in Y then press enter.<br /><br />When done, enter this command in the terminal.<br /><br />sudo bash -c &#039;echo vboxvideo &gt;&gt; /etc/modules&#039;<br /><br />Shutdown the virtual machine (you can do it manually inside the VM or press Right CTRL + Q and select &quot;Send extinction signal&quot;.<br /><br />Go back to VirtualBox and go to configuration =&gt; display. Check Activate 3D acceleration. Boot your VM, open terminal and type<br /><br />/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p<br /><br />You should now see that Unity 3D is supported. Good.<br /><br />7)TOR<br /><br />Run your VM. Open a firefox window and go to https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en<br /><br />Select the Linux version and download it. Close Firefox. We want to use that machine on the clearweb as little as possible.<br /><br />Unpack (or drag&amp;drop) the tor-browser_en-US folder in the folder &quot;Home&quot; or desktop or whervere you want.<br /><br />Open the folder and double click on &quot;start-tor-browser&quot;. It will open a weird text editor with gibberish stuff in it. Close it. We need to activate an option first.<br /><br />Push ALT, in that window, type &quot;dconf-editor&quot; and press Enter. In dconfg-editor go to: org =&gt; gnome =&gt; nautilus =&gt;preferences Click on &quot;executable-text-activation&quot; and from drop down menu select: &quot;launch: to launch scripts as programs.&quot; Close dconf-editor.<br /><br />You can now launch TOR. and browse anonymously the road. I strongly advise you to install KeePass for linux by going to Ubuntu Software Center to save passwords for Silkroad as well as your PGP passphrase.<br /><br />9) SHORT INTRODUCTION TO PGP VIA THE TERMINAL<br /><br />PGP is a powerful protocal that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages and files. It has been used for over 15 years and is the standard all over the world for industry and governement communications.<br /><br />So first, we must create our own set of keys. A) Creating your own keys To do so, open the terminal and type GPG. It will reply :<br /><br />gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...<br /><br />Ok, you&#039;ve got GPG installed already, perfect.<br /><br />To create your key, type :<br /><br />$ gpg --gen-key<br /><br />Type 1 then hit Enter<br /><br />You&#039;ll be asked to chose between 1024 and 4096 bits. Chose 4096 (the most secure), hit Enter.<br /><br />Next window, type 0, press Enter, then type Y, press Enter.<br /><br />You are now asked to enter your name, it&#039;s important you don&#039;t type in your Real Name obviously but it&#039;s also important to chose something that identifies you. I chose my Silkroad name so that my contacts know the key is mine.<br /><br />Email adress : a@a.a or whatever you want, shouldn&#039;t be real.<br /><br />Comment : none, press Enter<br /><br />Type in &quot;O&quot; to confirm, press Enter<br /><br />Enter passphrase, very important to chose something very secure. As usual, open up KeePass and generate a strong passphrase, there is no limitation AFAIK.<br /><br />Then you&#039;ll be asked to do random stuff on your computer to generate bytes to ensure randomness in your key pool. Do stuff, open a random file and type in stuff for exemple. Once it&#039;s done (it can take a few minutes), you now have your own set of keys.<br /><br />What we want to do know is to export the public key so that you can share it with your sellers/buyers.<br /><br />Type :<br /><br />gpg --armor --export your-email-adress-used-before<br /><br />Copy paste the public key in a .txt file on your desktop and share it whenever you buy/sell.<br /><br />B) Importing a public key<br /><br />To send a message to someone, you must important its key. To do so, create a document and copy paste the key there, close &amp; save it.<br /><br />Now, open seahorse (hit ALT and type in Seahorse, open the program called &quot;Passwords and keys&quot;.<br /><br />Put your cursor in the very top left of your screen and click file =&gt; import, select the file you saved the key in. Done.<br /><br />9) Encrypting a message<br /><br />Open the terminal and type :<br /><br />gpg -ear name-or-email-of-your-contact &lt;&lt;end<br /><br />Press Enter Type your message<br /><br />Press Enter, finish by typing &quot;end&quot; and press Enter again.<br /><br />You&#039;ll have your encrypted message. Something that looks like that :<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />hQIMA7eD31/5BBRZAQ/9Hq1r1gpOIf2r06zSIL8Ww0tUCC9PlNiMpemPwhpZsccB vO4MOMrnV41BHToTQNfh0xiZdXFxO/T6ow4oatP2Ap/BvZtipcAAjJKowP6aaTOJ Wgd7nC4FTJvRUjgkW/p3imlQsdTVb3+2dNzCPp0yrr8NocW77+4Ka/+4aoql0UmI 3mKLjo0+eof8qAnQd5jOaAcWTszhIwBd99rXVbRCjNa/jMsSQ9Vnn7L+WqYGHuAI MMdOCU3peifV/7zA6A0bMKzStWc1JIa84wus91/mmErkRcNZHqThCje8eulinzRm RthaH0yi7ty65F3IuSqbq/qdpdE9UXvwjySbFE7ANCPpnkP4jv+oL95UezyjbO2x ra1Il7XKbYvaf0oXJAz5xKsLfeHKB3kCR+Kxzt9NmdRZ4rPZ4ZjSN5WI9YeOL0t/ W7oaCyBcFD/6/m/63VNYZTrwrqBGqsWhXVFpoHalvd+09CffsdQjwDIMy9u3TtRk j+FDSGuukKrS/7exWSoajSDhTK+koSS8CIFvyocZ81EkGhnUjd4kxlIAu4UCXmG6 LiJXXo7X5PK7knGtlzZXstrtrrttr8FFeAbSHsZ0+ihdxtNSvx1EPewl TtLSKoUT9ickUrxFoPm2z1vqBwN/087EaCU6BSX8uwZ8GrxMwSKgVmQKfVyfgMDS RAGGtmuRwgfyhthrertwF0KV8nTajDnSqoGiMAgK7y+e320OEFnYXOKIXlue l7FvOHwi9jZbBAR4HHAfhgJIj78P =OT60 -----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />You can now send the encrypted message to your contact.<br /><br />10) Decrypting messages<br /><br />Open the terminal and type :<br /><br />gpg -da &lt;&lt;end<br /><br />Press enter, then copy paste the message you received. Press Enter, finish by tiping end then press Enter again.<br /><br />You will be asked to enter the passphrase to decrypt it. Open KeePass and copy paste it. The result will be like this :<br /><br />You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user: &quot;abcd a@a.a&quot; 4096-bit RSA key, ID xx, created 2013-05-08 (main key ID xxx)<br /><br />gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID xxx, created 2013-05-08 &quot;abcd a@a.a&quot; ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO THE SILK ROAD HERE<br /><br />You can now safely converse with your vendors.<br /><br />10) ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />If you found this tutorial helpful, you can send donations to <br /><br />19mvrcHzHTam5StiG4KJgUvY8WAU4iiUq1<br /><br />I hope everything worked well. Finally, the most important security advice someone can give is to use your brain. Don&#039;t do anything stupid and you should be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to discuss issues you may have encontered here or by PM, I&#039;ll gladly help you getting setup.<br /><br />Remember also that your security is only as good as your contacts security. For exemple, if your seller is stupid and keeps detailed informations of his buyers on file, then there isn&#039;t much you can do in case he gets caught.<br /><br />I could have sold this tutorial but I chose not to because my personnal security is guaranteed only if yours is aswell.
