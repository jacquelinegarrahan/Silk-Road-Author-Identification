				I suggest using bitinstant. Just go to bitinstant.com and select cash deposit to mt.gox. You obviously must sign up for an mt.gox account if you haven&#039;t already done so. After that you just put in the amount you want transferred to your mt.gox account. They will let you choose a bank near you to make the deposit, and they will send you an email with all of the information you need. You then go to the bank you chose and make the deposit into the account # that they emailed you. The bank will not ask for id or anything so you should be good. After the deposit just call the number that is in the email and confirm your deposit and the funds should be in you mt.gox account within a couple of minutes.

Gox access via clearnet. Mt Gox should be fine, but since you can&#039;t access it via Tor without getting your account locked, some people don&#039;t like the break in anonymity. In my opinion, there&#039;s no fuckin&#039; difference lol.

I don&#039;t think LE will track down specific e-mail addresses from bitcoin purchases, then look for the specific IP linked to that address. If they go this far, woopee they proved that you bought bitcoins. What now?<br /><br />If you really don&#039;t feel safe, create an e-mail with a proxy, you&#039;ll only need it for a day anyway lol.

I say throaway because hushmail is known to cooperate with law enforcement when asked. You do not need to use your real name on the GetBitcoin order, so there&#039;s no way to trace those coins back to you or your Silk Road account.

				Thanks for the responses. I guess hushmail could be OK if it was a one time thing, do they have a .onion URL? <br /><br />Would creating and using a yahoo or other web-based free email through tor be more or less equivalent to using a proxy? I was thinking of going that route unless there is some reason to not do that that may be escaping me.
