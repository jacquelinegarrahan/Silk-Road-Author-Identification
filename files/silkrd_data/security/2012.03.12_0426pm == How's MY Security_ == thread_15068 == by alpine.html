				just wanted to know what people thought about this plan.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.truecrypt&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; aes/two fish/serpent on all computers<br />2. all work done from a unhackable, self defending, ironkey flash drive same flash drive used by the Department Of Defense. <br />3. on the flash drive theres a portable vm liberte linux running from portable virtual box<br />3. i use a unprotected network to surf while changing my mac address with smac <br /><br />hows that and if you have any advice its more then welcome thanks, alpine

				visit https://bridges.torproject.org/ and pick at most three that use port 443, then tell your tor control app to use them. for obfs2 bridges I grabbed the obfs browser bundle, extracted a list of bridges from there and plugged it into arm.

				Haha, liked the answer.<br /><br />But the guy is just a buyer, and he already has a great security system. I don&#039;t see how bridges would improve or help it. Maybe if he is in a place that blocks Tor, but it&#039;s not the case.<br /><br />Stimulate everybody who access hidden services to use bridges may kill it.

				I was actually going to post the same question today.<br /><br />My plan:<br />- Anon Surfing/Silk Road/Email - Live Liberte USB, if I was forced to give up my pw it&#039;s okay because LIberte doesn&#039;t store any information (Correct me if I&#039;m wrong)<br />- Bitcoin/Money - Running Kubuntu on my freshly wiped machine with hidden OS. on the hidden OS have a hidden file container containing VM of Kubuntu with bitcoin wallet. Do all of my bitcoin transactions never going on TOR or SR or any other websites.<br /><br />Any other ideas would be good, I thought this sounded okay.<br /><br />Btw, OP I like your idea with the ironusb. If I used TrueCrypt to encrypt the drive would that be just as good, it seems like they use the same technology<br /><br />**update**<br />I just realized I can do all of this on the USB stick.<br />-Run Kubuntu on Encrypted OS, Run Liberte/Kubuntu on multisystem boot US(Hidden OS), keep bitcoin data in an encrypted file container on Kubntu Hidden OS.

				sounds like a great plan to me!!<br /><br />to answer some of your questions. <br />1. the difference between the ironkey and trucrypt are that ironkey has hardware encryption and self defends its self meaning if it detects someone hacking it will basically kill itself with multiple methods including short circuiting its memory meaning data recovery is next to impossible. ironkey has never been hacked. but keep in mind that even the FBI could not break true crypt so it is pretty safe unless you think the CIA or NSA are after you. LOL <br /><br />2.&nbsp; Correct me if i am wrong but i think if you create a live usb of liberte linux it will save things. becaause i just made one and it saved my text doc i put on the desktop.<br /><br /><br />3. only thing i would recommend is connecting to unprotected wifi. if theres none around you i would just get a cheap longer range wifi antenna or you could break someones wifi with wep in like 2 seconds lol.&nbsp; &nbsp;

But you can store your Liberte on a regular usb key and encrypt it. Then you can use the Ironkey for any persistent storage you need. It&#039;s a little tricky to access Ironkey from Liberte due to Liberte&#039;s security precautions, but if you&#039;ve got this far you&#039;ll work it out easily.<br /><br />

				Hi, I don&#039;t want to hijack this thread, but I&#039;d not heard of Ironkey before reading this.

Ironkey can also make sure that no exit-node is redirecting your web traffic by providing additional DNS protections. This anti-pharming [sic?] measure can also help mitigate phishing attacks and other threats&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Would there be any benefits, or hazards, to using their &quot;private Tor network&quot; for SR stuff?

The best option of course is to instead use a private bridge which you are running yourself since you are basically immune from non passive traffic confirmation attacks then.

				Ironkey is not immune from being hacked. It has a hardware encryption system with some neat features though. It protects from being brute forced because it securely erases your encryption key if too many bad attempts are made. It also is filled with encapsulation material and has a metal skin, to make it difficult to get to the encrypted key without damaging it and erasing it from memory, although (ex)military hackers have gotten around systems like this before:<br /><br />http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10625082&amp;pnum=0<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tarnovsky needed six months to figure out his attack, which requires skill in modifying the tiny parts of the chip without destroying it.<br /><br />Using off-the-shelf chemicals, Tarnovsky soaked chips in acid to dissolve their hard outer shells. Then he applied rust remover to help take off layers of mesh wiring, to expose the chips&#039; cores. From there, he had to find the right communication channels to tap into using a very small needle.<br /><br />The needle allowed him to set up a wiretap and eavesdrop on all the programming instructions as they are sent back and forth between the chip and the computer&#039;s memory.<br /><br />Those instructions hold the secrets to the computer&#039;s encryption, and he didn&#039;t find them encrypted because he was physically inside the chip.<br /><br />Even once he had done all that, he said he still had to crack the &quot;huge problem&quot; of figuring out how to avoid traps programmed into the chip&#039;s software as an extra layer of defence.<br /><br />&quot;This chip is mean, man - it&#039;s like a ticking time bomb if you don&#039;t do something right,&quot; Tarnovsky said.<br /><br />Joe Grand, a hardware hacker and president of product- and security-research firm Grand Idea Studio, saw Tarnovsky&#039;s presentation and said it represented a huge advancement that chip companies should take seriously, because it shows that presumptions about security ought to be reconsidered.<br /><br />&quot;His work is the next generation of hardware hacking,&quot; Grand said. <br /><br />&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ironkey is a nice high quality thumb drive with built in encryption and some nice difficult to defeat physical security features, but it is not the completely unhackable magic device you are making it out to be. It is FIPS140-2 level two certified, but the military probably uses level 4 certified stuff mostly.&nbsp; Anything without physical intrusion detection features can only get level 1 certification, level 4 needs to be able to detect any potential physical intrusion.

Since Ironkey controls the exit-node in your encrypted Tor circuit, we can ensure that no one is injecting unwanted or malicious content into your online communications, such as ads or spyware. <br />2. Ironkey can also make sure that no exit-node is redirecting your web traffic by providing additional DNS protections. This anti-pharming [sic?] measure can also help mitigate phishing attacks and other threats&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Would there be any benefits, or hazards, to using their &quot;private Tor network&quot; for SR stuff? Seems a bit too good to be true, and an excellent way for LE to connect to a big fat pipe of all sorts of interesting stuff...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Using their private Tor network is about as secure as using any other VPN, maybe a wee bit more since it is actually based on the Tor software, which protects better than most VPN software does from website fingerprinting and such. They also exit traffic through their trusted servers, so you can be more certain that traffic through the exit node wont be modified or spied on by random malicious parties. Of course it also ensures that all of your traffic can be modified and spied on as soon as the feds issue a warrant and force ironkey to cooperate. I don&#039;t know how much they have modified Tor or if they use any of its servers other than theirs. I am also not clear on if they are using Tor nodes they have added to the public Tor network or if they are using a fully private Tor network. In any case it is probably about as anonymous and secure as a VPN managed by a company like ironkey can be, which means potentially better than nothing but I certainly wouldn&#039;t rely on it. Do they even caim to not keep logs? It seems like they are selling it more as a tool to encrypt your internet traffic than as something to keep you anonymous, but in either case that is all you should really expect from it.
