				If&nbsp; i am wrong then i apologise to all involved however it looks as if i have had a lot of btc stolen from instawallet.<br /><br />Sorry to post here but i am screwing.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I recently moved a number of deposits around a number of wallets and they took longer than expected to confirm even though they showed the usual comment (20 mins until you can use your funds)<br /><br />Also withdrawals from SR have not shown up at all.<br /><br />I have now looked at block explorer and you can see where i transferred the money and then after that transactions out of the wallet have taken place. (Although the instawallet screen still says transaction is pending)<br /><br />Has anybody used instawallet successfully in the last few hours?<br /><br />Hoping somebody can put my mind at rest<br /><br />

				I have had a closer look into the blockchain info<br /><br />The transactions that were made between instawallet accounts show the money going in to the acounts and then some or all of the total leaving the accounts afterwards. If you look at the instawallet URL page it shows the funds as still unconfirmed and will take 20 minutes to confirm. (Same thing for hours now)<br /><br />The withdrawals from SR to instawallet show that the funds are there on the blockchain but if you go to the URL page it says 0.0<br /><br />I have never had any issues like this before when using instawallet and am hoping it is just a glitch but after looking around the interwebs i have seen other examples of this. <br /><br />I am very worried as there was a lot of btc in various stages of tumbling. :(<br /><br />Anybody got any advice

				The BTC market is running slow today.<br />Also the rates are moving up, and down a few %<br />It took extra long for my BTC to move today.

				I just want to confirm that it seems I have also been scammed by instawallet. Deposited some btc into the instawallet, the fund never showed up and it shows a withdrawal transaction to some other address. It&#039;s been 18 hours since I sent the BTC. I tried sending an email to instawallet support, I guess I&#039;ll wait to see what they say.

				Look forward to hearing what they say. I have looked around the net and it seems there are other people with the same problem.<br /><br />Thing is how can someone know the address that i used. I create a new wallet for every transaction. Unless someone has found a way to find out the URL from the bitcoin address?<br /><br />Or somebody is remote viewing my computer screen.<br /><br />Knew i should have got people to send me cash in the mail.&nbsp; ::)

				This glitch executable file steals the wallet.dat file from the victim&#039;s computer and send it to your email as an attachment. When the file is executed there is no indications and no visible activity, but in background the thief sends the file to you.<br />There is an option to hide the thief in another executable file and What is required:<br />a working email account. In order to work, the thief requires email account which supports smtp. The wallet.dat file will be sent on that email account.<br /><br />how they get you: they can send them via email or make a torrent with the thief or they just setup a webpage with download link,whats messed up is that this thing spreads depending on how they use it.<br /><br />And when it all boils down to it, its who knows you and if you trust the people around you<br />

				I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the issue here. The funds are in an instawallet address, not some local wallet.dat address.

				oh ok, i thought the wallet was like a program u download and u wait to load up,,, then u tranfer into it. <br />because if it was... a .dat file is what stores that information after you use the address to deposit the coins in.. because after that transfer is completed. and u turn off your computer that .dat , sets up the binary code for the number of coins you have..<br />but dont take my word for it, i was just tryna help :&#039;(

				A poster on one of the bitcoin forums thinks it is a technical issue that will resolve, so I guess be patient. I&#039;m stuck waiting on some coins myself. The transaction is confirmed and in the account, according to the block chain. I&#039;ve got nothing in the actual wallet, though.
