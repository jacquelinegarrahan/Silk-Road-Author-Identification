				I see bitcoins going on ebay for at least $22 per bitcoin and they always sell.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t more people buy from an exchange for 13.5 and then just resell them on ebay for a tidy profit?&nbsp; Are there dangers or pitfalls that Im missing?&nbsp; It seems like a rather simple way to make some quick cash.&nbsp; So what am I missing?

				There is a reason. Paypal does not allow digital delivery of goods. People will pay 50.00 a piece for your coins because they know as soon as they buy a 100 coins from you that Paypal will give them their money back and they get to keep the coins. Scammers are waiting for you right now to do that and will buy all you have and then PayPal will charge you back every dime and let them keep your coins. Even if you have a tracking number they will say they never received the digital items and you will get fucked by Ebay and PayPal as they watch scammers fuck you out of your coins and jack off while they watch. So be warned there is a scammer waiting on you if you do that and PayPal will let them scam you and them make you pay the money back that they paid you and they will keep your coins and your money. DO NOT DO IT!

				Thanks for your response, dashes my hopes at making some quick money but sure am glad I asked the question here before taking the risk.&nbsp; So these people that list the bitcoins simply don&#039;t care about the risk involved? I see the same people with multiple listings, why do it if the risk of getting scammed is so high?

				Those couple of people still selling after the last few weeks are most likely Ebay security and people who mail out a hard copy of bitcoins which still does not protect you and then they can redeem it after they receive it but that still isnt good enough for PayPal and Paypal will side with the customer every single time no matter what the case. Tracking or no tracking. STAY AWAY FROM EBAY AND PAYPAL! All they do is gather information on you and fuck you over. They will ruin your credit after they screwe you and put collections on your account. Never ever sell digital anything through PayPal or Ebay or anyone wh pays with PayPal. PAYPALSUCKS.com is a neat place to visit. YO can actually look up some bitcoin horror stories on googlle. I had a friend who was screwed for several thousand by PayPal and they let customers keep the coins and dont give one fuck about you.

				Wise choice.<br />Scammers can buy PayPal accounts and Ebay accounts and then buy a ton of coins, have them sent to a wallet and then leave you high and dry with the blessings of Paypal and Ebay. If you want some coins free that what they do. If i had account with Bill Me Later and about a 10,000 limit i could get it all sent to my BTC wallet and then be done with it. People use their Bill me Later this way and then say they never got the coins and then they are bot out anything and if the account is stolen then it really dont matter. Best thing to do is never use PayPal, never ever give them your information because they are fucking BANKSTER TRASH.
