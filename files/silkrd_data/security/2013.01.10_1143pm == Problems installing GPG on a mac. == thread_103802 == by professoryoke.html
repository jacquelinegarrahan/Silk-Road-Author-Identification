				Trying to install GPGTools (As per the suggestion of the bitcoin-otc wiki) so that I can trade on bitcoins-otc, however I can&#039;t seem to be able to install it on my mac. I can download it, and when I open it I can use the installer, but after I go through all the steps to install it nothing happens. I don&#039;t have any program I can use, just the same zip file and disk image I started with.<br /><br />Can anyone point me in the right direction? Or suggest another mac friendly GPG?

				Google gpg for usb, I guess. Windows users should use it too. There are benefits for the usb-gpg above the gpg-win version.

(The authors are working on a Mac version, but who knows when it will be available.) <br /><br />Your only option is GPGTools at present, provided that you are running a supported version of OS X.&nbsp; GPGTools will not run on Leopard (`10.5) -- you must be running Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8) for GPGTools to properly function. <br /><br />Furthermore, you may need to be running one of the nightly builds. <br /><br />Here is Guru&#039;s tutorial: <br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X <br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5) <br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using <br />the command-line. <br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the <br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and <br />running. <br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into <br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check <br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut. <br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts: <br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text. <br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you <br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do <br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration <br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button <br />is selected. <br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: <br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links. <br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire <br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to <br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only <br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to <br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is <br />checked. <br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then <br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of <br />keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring: <br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />============================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG. <br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the <br />recipient&#039;s PGP public key. <br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste <br />it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file, <br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be <br />found in the Documents folder. <br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the <br />Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then <br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It <br />will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the <br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key <br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring. <br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a <br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then <br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in <br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you <br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message <br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR). <br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will <br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the <br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else <br />that it needs to go. <br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that <br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use <br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D <br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, <br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase <br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, <br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing <br />the encrypted message that was there previously. <br /><br />Guru<br /><br />
