				Does anyone know what sized encryption the persistent volume in tails uses and if it is secure from most&nbsp; bruteforce attacks we would have to deal with here? Would I be safe if it was bruteforced by those nsa computers in utah? lol. After some reasearch I think LUKS in Ubuntu might use AES-256 but im not sure about tails. The only information I really found is that it uses LUKS, I stopped using truecrypt because I don&#039;t really trust it as much. I&#039;m trying to make sure LUKS in tails is secure if anyone can help out?

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Yes, it is secure. Ubuntu uses AES-256 to encrypt the disk volume and has a cypher feedback to help protect it from frequency attacks and others attacks that target statically encrypted data.<br /><br />As an algorithm, AES is secure and this has been proved by crypt-analysis testing. The weakness actually lies within the cypher and the software to pass it the keys. Specifically lies in the keystore (which is stored in the header of the volume), the keystore is secured by a passphrase. Passphrases are of course open to some attacks such as dictionary/brute force (if this was successful, it would decrypt the keystore). Using long &quot;complex&quot; non-word passwords would reduce the chance of this happening.<br /><br />The only other possibility to decrypt is using recording devices or social engineering to determine your passphrase.<br /><br />In short, your computer is reasonably safe unless you are subject to serious organised cyber crime or Government investigation!&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>~ Source:***CLEARNETWARNING*** http://askubuntu.com/questions/97196/how-secure-is-an-encrypted-luks-filesystem<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to be &quot;that guy&quot; but you should startpage/duckduckgo it. You can find a lot of research but I suppose your encryption will only be as strong as your key.<br /><br />I would personally consider LUKS encryption safe as long as you have a lengthy key with lots of variation.

				Technically it&#039;s just as secure as TrueCrypt. And unlike TrueCrypt, which you can only download over an unsecure connection, Tails gets downloaded over a secure connection.<br />Downloading TrueCrypt over an unsecure connection means that an attacker could intercept the connection and give you their version of TrueCrypt with backdoor instead. Most people don&#039;t verify their TrueCrypt downloads.
