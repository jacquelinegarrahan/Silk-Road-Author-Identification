				Is there a possibility that the TSA could detect a tiny amount of LSD (5-10 tabs) if carried in carry-on wrapped in a pen casing. (IE. open the pen pull out the ink cartridge. Roll wrapped LSD around it and stick it back in.)<br /><br />Or put as a &quot;book mark&quot; in a book.

				You&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; I have never heard of LSD being detected, and you have concealed it well enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				It&#039;s very unlikely that you will be caught, dogs are not trained to detect LSD either.<br />Your only downside is freaking out, and having them search your stuff thoroughly.<br /><br />Which really, you&#039;ll very much most likely not get caught.

				edit: -----<br /><br />You should be fine. Maybe put your tenstrip in a gum wrapper with a piece of gum so it&#039;s wrapped in foil, then transfer it to real aluminum foil after getting through security. Or just keep it on the gum and eat the gum when you want to take the doses too for good measure.

				You&#039;ll be fine man. A few 1/4&quot; by 1/4&quot; tabs are pretty easy to stash. Besides LSD is MILLIONTHS of a gram. No way can it ever be detected by scent. I&#039;ve had liquids of mind tested by TSA before, but never on solid objects like a tab of blotter. I honestly have never heard of someone getting busted for blotters. Maybe vials I could see, but not blotters.

				^ dogs can smell LSD, they&#039;re just not trained to detect it. I can&#039;t imagine how they would train them to smell LSD anyway...<br />Active at such small doses, I could forsee many accidental trips.

				Few weeks ago I had 2 flights with some blotters with me :) Everything was fine. I won&#039;t tell you my way of hiding it just because I don&#039;t want this to be read by the cops.<br /><br />But there are 1001 ways to conceal few tiny pieces of paper. I assume the best way is to hide it is in some other papers (no picture on x-ray). The one should spend a lot of hours skrutinizing your luggage knowing what he&#039;s looking for.

				ok, because LE is a legitimate concern can you guys answer this question instead of saying acutal methods:<br /><br />what materials are ok to package LSD in?&nbsp; will wrapping it in paper transfer the dose to the paper at all?&nbsp; etc.

				IMO LSD has to be the easiest drug to smuggle in small amounts (&gt;a sheet). Put it in your wallet in the middle of some business cards. Or put it in a briefcase with other important documentation. Too easy and I wouldnt shed a drop of sweat over it. Be safe.
