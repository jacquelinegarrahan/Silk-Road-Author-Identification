				iv heard people say not to use TorBrowser when looking up tracking numbers with USPS. i guess what im asking is what kinds of dangers are there in checking on a package and how can i protect myself? any help on this subject would be appreciated.

				Hey self!! If say u do check thru for. Yeah they many not be able to get to u in time but if there is a backlog they can always just flag the address and plag e sending address or even zip.. Once that comes in again they can log it and ever time I assume until they have so many logs.. Thy may even see a pattern in the times in which the packages are coming through. Knowing the pattern then they can take that approx date and really watch the screens or what ever they do and find said package and then flag it grab it and do an inspect. <br /><br />Would they come after you mr small time I don&#039;t sell I am a nobody ...... U are somebody and u have the one thing they need to keep this whole thing rolling nice and smooth. CASH...... They can come get u and tie u up for a nice long time while your pockets empty green bills that oil the enti system until they bleed you dry and hang u out with an orange jumpsuit cleaning sides of roads... <br /><br />Maybe I think on it too much....A?

				i will keep the faith that it stays that way for u! <br /><br />U gotta believe they are light years ahead of where we think they are in the realm of weeding out packages. Its the GOVERNMENT its their JOB to knwo everything u are doing. If they didnt they would not be able to control as they do.. THey are slipping but they are still in power so they are doing the job they are SUPPOSED to do...&nbsp; u know how u always hear something 2 years down the road that they had the program or processes in place.. Like the VEST testing ground. If i was a developer and i am not but i was developing something for the mail system where u gonna test it and who u gonna sell it for and where u gonna make the most bang for your buck... . They dont have any money.. Its like scare tactics.. Like the news when its gonna snow. THE run on the store for bread and milk.. They say STAMP prices are gonna rise better STOCK up!! Run on stamps means influx of cash.. <br /><br />I am a freak and when i hear things like that i just think what are they really trying to hide..&nbsp; <br /><br />they know way way way too much and hide most likely double. PLOD along and keep the masses glued to the idiot box while its business as usual..

				I can say unequivocally that checking through Tor does not mean SHIT.<br /><br />I have used it for years ....<br /><br />Like others have said, they are billions in debt and there is a couple million tracking requests a day I am sure, maybe more. So even if they flagged something, most packages are labelled with pen and ink, not registered in a central database like Fedex/UPS ... it just isnt possible.

				I&#039;m really at a loss to think of one good reason for using Tor to check the tracking on your own package. But I can sure think of a few reasons why it&#039;s probably a good idea not to.<br /><br />Places like MtGox will freeze your account and launch an AML (anti-money laundering) investigation if they detect you logging to their website through Tor, so it&#039;s no big stretch to think package couriers - particularly one run by the US Gov&#039;t - are capable of it. I only hope they remain sufficiently disorganized and incompetent to put into action because If they did track such things, they would flag those packages for a &quot;closer look&quot; or maybe just log it in a database, or maybe they would use it for pinpointing the people who *send* you packages. <br /><br />Fortunately USPS is staffed and operated by half-witted public-sector workers and their tracking information, at least the public side of it, isn&#039;t updated very often (compared it to, say, UPS). But make no mistake about it - the browsing anonymity provided by Tor is effectively nullified when you&#039;re accessing personal information linked to your location and identity. It&#039;s much less likely to draw any attention if you use the normal internet for things like that.

				people track packages everyday. treat the package as if its anything else legit when it comes to dealing with the PO. if your a personal buyer and dont expect a CD, its okay to track your package. On the other hand, if a CD is possible, there goes your plausible deniability because it shows you were expecting the package.
