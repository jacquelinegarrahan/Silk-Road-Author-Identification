				&nbsp;- The Setup -<br /><br />So, I have a SR account with the same user name as my account here on the forums. I also have a tor email account with the same user name. I had allowed in the SR forums settings to allow others to email me and set that account to the tor email address. I also had my GPG key with the tor email address posted in these forums.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Now the problem -<br /><br />I accidentally replied with my Tor e-mail account to a friends normal email ( i.e. msn.com gmail.com aol.com lycos.com). In the reply was my Normal email address which is unmistakably linked to my real identity.<br /><br />&nbsp;- The Paranoia ?-<br /><br />Do you think it is likely that the US Government is scraping this website ( I do with out a doubt). If so, do you think they are keeping a DB of all the email addresses they find here ( I do with out a doubt). If so, do you think they have some kind of blanket search warrant to get a copy of any email with the From or To set to one of these email addressees in the DB that go though any of the major email providers?<br /><br />That last question is the big one. Like do you think they have a system setup to monitor all email&#039;s from major email providers, or that the email providers supply the US Government with the emails? Second, do you think the US Government dose have a blanket Warrant to get any and all email that is sent to a major email provider from one of the email addresses found on this website?<br /><br />&nbsp;- The Real Question -<br /><br />So, do you think I should stop using this identity all together, and start fresh on SR with a new username?

				Well this is Jinx is not the username in question. It is another user name that I compromised. I guess I can just tell the people I bought from before that I am changing my user name and build up the rep agin from them. I do not have a big enough record at this point for any cops to care about me yet, so as long as I change it now I should be fine.<br /><br />If anyone ells has any thoughs I&#039;d like to hear them :)<br /><br />P.S. someone took the Jinx username on SR already, Arg.
