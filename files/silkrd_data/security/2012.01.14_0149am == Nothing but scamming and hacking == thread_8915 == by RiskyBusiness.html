				Given you joined the forum yesterday, I can&#039;t understand your rational? I have been scammed twice out of 25 purchases, and the scam happened when I was new and fresh meat? These days and with the help of the forum, it has been flawless, plus I have experience some great characters. And made some really friendly anonymous mates lol...<br /><br />Post a problem and you will get a solution, the SR community is farking awesome!<br /><br />Hoffa

				Joining the forum yesterday...under THIS name, yes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been active on SR as both a vendor and as a buyer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only lost btc, had posts deleted, accounts closed without cause, accounts hacked, customers burned without any way to contact them.&nbsp; All along, SR is actually causing the dysphoria by eliminating my vendor accounts and buyer accounts over and over again.<br /><br />They know that I&#039;ll come back and plop another $150 in btc in their lap.&nbsp; They know that I&#039;ll fill orders and leave my btc in my wallet.&nbsp; They know that if they cancel my pending orders and close my account, they can count on more btc than if they just collected a meager commission from my sales.&nbsp; And they know that they can let scammers pay them for accounts, and run amok for enough time that people don&#039;t lose faith in SR, but still SR collects whether they are &quot;flawless&quot; or far from being such.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaving.&nbsp; I&#039;m done.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lost too much money, and that&#039;s the reason why SR feels it was worth it.&nbsp; What they don&#039;t know is there will be an insurmountable amount of blow back for their failure to do any effective policing of the site, and their failure to use proper discretion when deciding which vendors to allow to continue conducting business on the SR.&nbsp; I have huge rolls of personal information from selling on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on blowing the doors wide open on what&#039;s happening here, one buyer at a time.

				Why is SR picking on you?&nbsp; If you have a legitimate complaint, then define it. You have blamed SR, then go on to say all your buyers deserve their identities revealed.&nbsp; I have a feeling you are simply too impatient to become established as a vendor or run a profitable service, and you are obviously the type to do something to halt that process, threatening to give out customer info.&nbsp; We are happy to see you go.<br /><br />Like I said, if you have a specific problem, then define it. It makes no sense that your account has been shut down only to start a new one multiple times and suffer the same fate. Then complain AFTER the fact.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d check that you have the right link for silkroad, first. I think those activities could be representative of somebody on one of the phishing/scam sites. But, for the vast majority of the rest of us, SR has treated us very well. I&#039;ve had 13 successful transactions, and 8 or so are still in the works, though I&#039;m very confident that they&#039;ll arrive. I&#039;ve been frustrated by BTC value fluctuations, but any loss of dollar value has not in any way been the fault of SR; as a matter of fact, the fluctuations by chance actually caused me to gain over $200 on my last BTC purchase, which I was very happy (albeit lucky) about.

				People on SR are whispering.&nbsp; There are rumors of new vendors getting blacklisted for no apparent reason.&nbsp; BTC being seized by SR administrators, and the vendor account fees being forfeited.&nbsp; SR protects the older vendors from the lower prices of new vendors, and the older vendors kick them a higher commission, in return.&nbsp; SR vendors are recommending using PGP for all private messages.&nbsp; For instance, just us having this conversation is enough to get your account banned, and wallet hijacked.&nbsp; I think that my last vendor who I ordered from was one of those that is posting on this in the forums, because right about the time he vanished, I noticed the same style of writing in the forums, under various names.&nbsp; Now the forums are closed.&nbsp; With this message:&nbsp; &quot;The Silk Road forums are down for maintenance. We will get them back up asap, but it could be a couple of days. Thank you for your patience.&quot;<br /><br />...right after that thread blew up.<br />The point of all of this is simple.&nbsp; If even just a few of us are subject to malicious acts by SR, as powerful as those described in the forum, then it stands to reason that all of us are at risk.&nbsp; Not one of us is immune to this racket, except those that are running it.&nbsp; If this evidence-backed allegation on the forums is true, then SR is not a libertarian dream.&nbsp; It is an authoritarian nightmare.<br /><br />The presumption that this &quot;one guy&quot; is the only case, is incorrect. In his thread, he mentions how this was the only thread that got any public attention before being deleted by the administrators. In comparing the very few regular and long time posters, with the infinite amount of suppressed voices, it is reasonable to suspect that a large majority are having their wallets hijacked and vendor&#039;s account deleted. Since this person seems to be asking for nothing more than a reasonable explanation from SR administrators, I question whether he had his account deleted for any misconduct. For what reason is SR silent on the issue? Why do they keep deleting the accounts of those that are exercising their right to free speech? How many accounts need to be silently deleted until the more reputable dealers feel insecure?<br /><br />A reasonable person might say &quot;You know, there actually aren&#039;t many vendors that have accounts predating several months ago. I wonder where they all went?&quot; SR is silent on this issue.<br /><br />It&#039;s a great opportunity for vendors to make money, but what if these same vendors have zero recourse when SR decides to permanently delete the fruits of their efforts? What if there is no forum to address this serious issue, even though every other possible issue is public? What does the closing of the forum and deletion of the threads say about SR? Why are there only a few that take to SR&#039;s defense? Who can say that these &quot;people&quot; who claim that they&#039;ve had no issues with their account, aren&#039;t silk road themselves?<br />What if this is all one big hoax, and SR responds with a full explanation of what happened to these numerous and nameless vendors? Nothing. But what if they can&#039;t explain why so many accounts seem to vanish, and forum postings describing unexplained banishment from SR, remain unanswered? Nothing good.

If you go the fake ID route I suggest using in state ID because eventually the feds may start to pay close attention to boxes registered with out of state IDs (since a higher overall percentage of them are probably used for illegal things than boxes registered with in state ID). <br /><br />Just a warning to any anti-drug crusaders who want to publish peoples addresses, but you really should be careful, just because LE are incompetent fuckwads doesn&#039;t mean you wont piss off a smart hacker buyer and end up deanonymized with your personal info spammed on SR as being a snitch who is attacking SR. I sure wouldn&#039;t want 100k drug users and dealers to know that I am not only a snitch but want to snitch on them. It doesn&#039;t seem like it would be safe to me. Just looking out for you of course if you didn&#039;t think of that possibility. But really you are just a troll.

				Let&#039;s a take a general lesson from this obviously angry person, whether a previously legit vendor who got a raw deal or whatever - we will never know. I do know that Digitalink has been very upset over the accusations, even though many, many of his buyers came to his defense. <br /><br />We do not know who this person is. The accusation he levels at SR as having a policy-based on anti-vendor actions...well, as Mr. Ddro says, ....in short, what ever Ddro says is right. Overall, the vendors here that are professionals have overall stuck with it and have worked out some nasty technical and process problems that cut to the heart of their BTC accounts, and other very sticky buyer issues. So, if they worked it out, why can&#039;t another vendor work it out?<br /><br />I know a full time &quot;dealer&quot; of pain meds. A local. he has done a very good quantified modeling of using SR as opposed to his daily drive of 8 or 10 stops, plus the new, unknown pop up customers that theoretically should not happen in his world. he has an almost airtight defense against busts in his current modality, yet he thinks that SR could be an adjunct or alternate way to reduce risk, reduce labor, and slightly increase profit margin. He&#039;s done the math, not the meth!<br /><br />I hope that any vendor who has a bad experience will not harm their customers; I am troubled that any vendor would keep shipping addresses as leverage. Very bad idea, and shortsighted in the extreme, and it cuts both ways. Uncorroborated drops of evidence from an unknown source with unknown intent might not even&nbsp; play against a buyer. Not in many cases.<br /><br />Also, one last fact. Vendors not only have SR, they have intermediaries like Digital Arch, Nomad, other vendors in good standing - and I am 100% positive that other vendors would seek to help another vendor in similar good standing if there was a repairable dispute between that vendor and the SR administration. <br /><br />SR is only as good as its vendors, and its growth is tied to new vendors. The bonds between a good vendor and their customers are very strong, stronger than I ever could have imagined. This is the &quot;some else&quot;, that is missing from real world, small time, local trafficking.&nbsp; There is the ability to get a reputation and have it administered in the context of &quot;a system of advocacy and standards of good practice&quot;, is a valuable service. SR is more than a market - its a system of trust ranking. <br /><br />SR has flaws, it&#039;s still too easy to have sham sellers get their first 1000 BTC with no apparent down side. As for good vendors with really really unfortunate circumstances, I do believe that there must be some type of recourse, and if not, at least a way of limiting one&#039;s losses before going ballistic&gt;&gt;&gt; like this gentleman (err...) here. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
