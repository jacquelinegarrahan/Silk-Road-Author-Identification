				In February I am departing on a cruise ship that goes to the Caribbean, and to a little bit of South America. It hits the virgin islands (St Thomas, St Marteen, St Bartts) and Barbados. I was curious how crazy security is on a cruise ship. Me and some buddies were talking about bringing on about 1/2 oz of Marijuana and some LSD, MDMA, etc. Would it be easy to bring all of that aboard? If not is the true stuff easy to obtain on shore? I know with Alcohol there are no Taxes, Duties, but they won&#039;t let you have it until you get back. Do you guys have any tricks on how to bring on some high quality booze from the shores without the ship taking it away?

				No direct knowledge, but it would seem like there would only be so much security.&nbsp; If they treat their customers like criminals, they aren&#039;t going to have many customers!&nbsp; Be aware however that staff will have access to your room when you are not in it, so some secure way to keep things out of their hands is probably your biggest issue.&nbsp; Otherwise the staff will be VERY happy and you will be a sad panda.&nbsp; What would you do, tell on them for stealing all your contraband?

				Ive been on cruises before and i usually just throw some booze in water bottles and pack it in my bag. They have the right to search your bags coming onboard but don&#039;t always do. Just don&#039;t bring anything you cant live without if it were to get confiscated.

				I was thinking... if I was to bring Marijuana aboard, where would I smoke it. I know drinking on international waters is not a problem, but the recreational use of Marijuana? Maybe the top deck, or is security pretty much everywhere? The last thing I would want is to spend my cruise at the bottom of the ship in a clunker for possession of Marijuana.

				I&#039;m sure you could find a spot.&nbsp; Bring papers and roll J&#039;s so they are easy to get rid of if you need to.&nbsp; Bring some dryer sheets and make a silencer like you&#039;re 15 again.

				<br />If you&#039;re not married to bringing your own, generally when you pull into port you&#039;ll be bombarded with locals trying to sell you &quot;the real marley weed&#039;. When i travel to jamaica, thats the first order of business, find a good dealer and tell him to come back in the morning with a lb, maybe 200 USD. Quality is low but, for vacation, price is right. After picking out all the seeds and shit,&nbsp; we(4)&nbsp; have enough to smoke for the week .<br />

				When I went on a cruise security was tight, but not that tight, you should be able to smuggle some weed and other stuffs on, I wouldn&#039;t keep it in a bag, if memory serves they do scan the bag. A s far as where to smoke, just smoke it in your room and spray some air freshener or something.

This dude emptied out a large bottle of Listerine and refilled it with vodka, then added three drops of green and one drop of blue food coloring. He posted pics, and it looked like the real deal. And if your luggage does get searched, who&#039;s going to test out your mouthwash? It seemed like a clever idea to me.

If I was to buy on the island I was wondering about anywhere in the Virgin Islands or Barbados, or are the virgin islands closely patrolled?

Is weed legal in any of these ports?

				A cruise I went on to the Bahamas searched luggage &amp; took alcohol. They didn&#039;t search all luggage as someone I was with got over 10 bottles on-board; it all comes down to disguise; stash it within an electronic; make a stash box out of something like an antique camera.

				Speaking from experience here-they will not search your person before boarding, just a metal detector, so any thing you can put in your pockets gets on the boat. And of course a glass or wood pipe will get on fine. Once on board, if your lucky you have a balcony and your in there, if not, smoke in your bathroom with shower and fart fan on, the old toilet paper roll with dryer sheets will take care of the smell plenty good. It doesn&#039;t hurt to tip you room steward throughout the cruise. <br />Just remember, they want you to have fun and come back and spend more money, so as long as you don&#039;t put your hands on anyone or stick your dick in the mashed potatoes, they will not fuck with you. <br />And last but not least, make sure all your party favors are gone by the time you return, you gotta go through customs...have fun friend.
