				To all people who are skeptical of using clear net for self destructed notes. (basically Privnote.com), there is a TOR based service that does the same thing but better because its a TOR hidden service like Tormail. <br /><br />http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion/<br /><br />http://sms4tor3vcr2geip.onion/faq<br /><br />SMS4TOR. <br /><br />Use it and&nbsp; don&#039;t forget to donate.

				The concept of Privnote itself is retarded..<br />It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a hidden service or not.<br />Why should I trust private communication with an unknown third party when I can use PGP instead.<br />For all I know that site is run by LE..

				I didn&#039;t say it was a substitute for PGP. It&#039;s a substitute for not leaking your IP to clear net sites while sharing non critical information. <br /><br />If you exit into a clearnet site you are using a tor exit relay, but if it stays in TOR you are much more secure. <br /><br />Use your judgement when using these sites but in any case, it&#039;s better than Privnote and vendors who accept privnote will most likely switch over. <br /><br />

				You aren&#039;t leaking your IP address to Privnote either if you&#039;re visiting them through tor.<br />I also highly doubt that the vendors who accept Privnote, are using it for non-critical information.<br />I don&#039;t see any valid reason why I&#039;d want to use this to share non-critical information..<br />They could be storing every message indefinitely and sharing all messages with LE.

				The guy who created that site started a thread here a few months ago. There was a long debate with him about why it&#039;s unsafe, but he might have deleted the thread, because I can&#039;t find it. Other people have come up with similar ideas:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131274.msg897203#msg897203<br /><br />You can read the extensive debate there and how we go into great detail explaining why it&#039;s a bad idea.<br /><br />The issue isn&#039;t whether it&#039;s a hidden service or a clearnet site. It&#039;s the fact that you have to trust a third party with your sensitive info. PGP is the safest option you have. Don&#039;t be lazy about your security.<br />

Why should we? <br /><br />I&#039;m skeptical more of the Privnote .SYS itself than it being on clearnet. For the record I don&#039;t like clearnet either. <br /><br />................................. wait a minute. Wasn&#039;t this that PGP thing that sus username came in here a few months back supporting? It looks exactly the same, except barely re-designed and re-labelled as Privnote. Guys, it&#039;s exactly the same thing, it even has the same wording, background and icons for fuck suck. 2 people on the PGP thread blasted his idiocy and he picked up his ball and went home, now 3 months later the exact same thing has returned. For all I know the OP is the same person, who really knows on an anonymous marketplace forum.<br /><br />I also cannot donate as I do not know where the money is going or even the identity of the webmaster or even if they are LE. For all I know, it could be my dad. :o <br /><br />Whatever.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I&#039;ve finished reading the FAQ at this site and it is the exact same text as the one before, along with the site design. In addition to this the PGP they use is called bCrypt, which I have never heard of and which they claim is a stronger standard of encryption. However, it is only a fraction of the length of standard PGP messages. Anyway I searched &#039;bCrypt&#039; and it turns out it is not made up. Congratulations. My recommendation is unchanged however. Don&#039;t use it. Use Privnote before using this. And we all know you don&#039;t use Privnote for SR. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />

				Peeps...<br /><br />If you use PGP properly, it doesn&#039;t matter if you use tormail, privote, clearnet email, semaphore, carrier pigeons, smoke signals, or fucking postcards to send them.<br /><br />Just use PGP and Tor. They&#039;re there to protect you

Sometimes we make it too complicated. <br /><br />Also, as from a few days ago, privnote now encrypts your messages but it doesn&#039;t make any difference, it&#039;s still unsafe. Also, a message sent to me via privnote the other day malfunctioned as privnote&nbsp; warped the decrypt process and my message was lost. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
