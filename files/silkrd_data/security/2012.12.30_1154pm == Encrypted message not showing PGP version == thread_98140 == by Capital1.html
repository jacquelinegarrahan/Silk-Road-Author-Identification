This string is informational only -- in general, it has no bearing on whether or not you can encrypt/decrypt any particular message. Sometimes it is useful to know which version of PGP/GPG and which OS a user is running -- e.g. if a user&#039;s key bears the following version string: Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32) then this is a giveaway that they are running Windows, and they likely are using GPG4WIN (and possibly Kleopatra) to boot. <br /><br />Likewise, if a user&#039;s key has the following Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.18 (Darwin) we know they&#039;re using Mac OS X. <br /><br />This information is nice to have, if the user is running into problems, so a proper recommendation can be made to help remedy the situation. One side effect is leaking a little information (i.e. your OS) to a potential adversary, but the risk from this is vanishingly small. <br /><br />NC<br />

Matching the key ID will be much better evidence than the program version. Still, as I said, it&#039;s entirely avoidable. Publishing the version makes sense in the normal use case for PGP, which is distributed software development. Those people are not anonymous and have no reason to hide their PGP program. In that case, I understand the argument that posting the version can allow others to alert you if you are using vulnerable software. You have that benefit at no cost. In our case, the cost is a smaller anonymity set, sometimes down to a unique identifier.<br /><br />Think of it this way, most people would not dare to post their first name (even without the last name) publicly. Somehow that&#039;s a scary proposition, even though there are millions of Johns and Daniels in the world. But they have no problem posting a PGP version with no more than 1/1350 market share, which is like publicly posting that your first name is Kolten, Jensen or Yurem. <br /><br />http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/baby_names_top1000.asp?page=2&amp;gender=0<br /><br />Not a good idea, in my opinion.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98140.msg694996#msg694996">Quote from: Nightcrawler on December 31, 2012, 10:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Frankly, the people who have the most to worry about in this list are those with the BCPG PGP versions.
