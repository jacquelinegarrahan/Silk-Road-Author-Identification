				If anyone has the funding available to them&nbsp; I think another sound level of security for your person is to have webcams set up in your house or any other type of surveillance cameras that are hidden and that upload on the fly to not just a destination in your home but to one off site as well just in case LEO discovers it and they&nbsp; destroy the contents.<br /><br />The contents being if they ever bust in on you&nbsp; try to goad them into violating your right. Like smack you around or something while you are just sitting down in a chair (hopefully handcuffed. That way&nbsp; once you make bond and get out not only will charges if any not stick you will probably get to file a law suit against them for violating your civil rights.<br /><br />Again just trying to add layers to all of our protection.

				Lol I agree with your concerns, I&#039;m all for hedging bets and tucking corners to make sure you&#039;re being safe. But installing video surveillance in your house for the off chance that you are busted for an amount that produces a warrant and the small chance that they will let you remain in your house while it&#039;s being searched, even lesser percentage chance that they will put you in front of your said hidden surveillance camera and then the miniscule chance that you will be able to entice an officer, surrounded by others who will be searching your home, to hit you or violate your rights in some way?

Not very much at all. It wouldn&#039;t cost you that much to set up a few cameras.<br /><br />And it&#039;s good for general security anyway, not just for if you got busted. It wouldn&#039;t be very hard at all to set them up streaming to a mobile device, which means you would be able to keep an eye on your place when on the road/out and about. <br /><br />Why the downer, what possible harm could this do? For any serious vendor here, or just anyone who has to be slightly more concerned about their security, this is a great idea. <br /><br />I wonder how many times the police have roughed someone up or planted evidence, only for it to be their word against the defendants word. Probably a lot more than you would think. And even if its very very very rare, why not plan ahead for that contingency, however unlikely?<br /><br />When it comes to risking years of your life in a fucking prison cell, there&#039;s no such thing as paranoia.

				I can&#039;t make it any clearer on how poor of an idea it is than my last post. It&#039;s standard for the home owner to be removed from the home while it&#039;s being searched. An officer &#039;roughing up&#039; a suspect is one thing if it&#039;s a beat cop busting meth heads, quite another for one to try this with the numerous other officers that would be around.<br /><br />Just seems like a stupid waste of time and effort for nothing. If you&#039;re really at this stage 10 of paranoia then the cameras would be better spent monitoring your mailbox, profiling mail carriers so you know who fills the normal postman&#039;s route when he&#039;s gone, monitoring for suspicious cars staking out your house.<br /><br />Like I said, I&#039;m all for being cautious, but this just isn&#039;t a reasonable idea for a sane person.

				Good way to make sure nobody installs physical keylogger on your computer or bugs your house while you away. Of course it can be defeated too in many cases.

				Meister&nbsp; your outlook on this is all based on speculation and what you are ASSUMING the cops will and will not do.<br /><br />Like hit you in front of others - WRONG<br />Not be in view of the camera. Cams can be assigned&nbsp; up in corners&nbsp; to where an entire room is under surveillance<br />Setting up a cam system for this purpose would not be extravagantly expensive.<br /><br />All it does is&nbsp; add one more layer of security. If you want to ignore one go ahead. Just do not be surprised when your number is called and you do not have that contingency prepared for.

				sounds like an interesting idea but it also sounds expensive. How much do you think a set up like this would cost for the average person?
