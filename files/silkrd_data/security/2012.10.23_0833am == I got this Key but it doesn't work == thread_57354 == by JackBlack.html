This vendor needs to be shot and pissed-on. <br /><br />This is nothing short of absolute, complete and total incompetence, even negligence. <br /><br />What literally takes, eats and shits the cake is that&nbsp; this guy sells Ecstasy by the kilo. I think my head is going to explode now. <br /><br />If congenital idiots like this are allowed to do business here, I might as well say, &quot;Fuck it!&quot; and throw in the towel -- this place is beyond redemption. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Key is actually from user Dutchaanbod .. he sells very decent Product&nbsp; but the encryption method doesn&#039;t satisfy me ... I thought of using privnote and sending it as a pm instead of encrypting email ... what u guys think .. ?<br />

				priv note is definitely not secure or recommended <br /><br />what to do i am really not sure except maybe try to find another vendor. there is no &quot;safe&quot; way to send your address really unfortunately <br /><br />or actually since he is just going to unencrypt using igolder, you could just encrypt using igolder too. just dont put anything but your address... even if igolder logs your address as long as you dont mention anything else (absolutely NOTHING about drugs) then all they will have in their system is you address, which is basically nothing incriminating compared to your address being in cleartext on SR servers.<br /><br />im sure others will disagree with me... i want to make it clear i am not saying its safe though or even recommended - thats not what i am trying to say, its just an idea; trying to figure out which would be the lesser of two evils if you must use the vendor - which i dont recommend...
