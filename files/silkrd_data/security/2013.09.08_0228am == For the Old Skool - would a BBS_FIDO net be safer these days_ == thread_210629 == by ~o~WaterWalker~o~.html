				&quot;Burlap Road?!~&quot; LMAO!

				It actually would be &#039;safer&#039;, but you would adapt it for modern arch and ditch the phone lines. You would ssh into a hidden freebsd jailed server that presented you with the same kind of text only interface RenegadeBBS had which would eliminate Xorg and browsers completely removing that enormous attack space. It would be pretty much impossible to remote pwn you through ssh unless whoever ran it could social engineer you into running console commands. You could also set it up so each user has an ssh key instead of passwords, remove that entire attack space of brute forcing. DDOS attacks would be difficult because they would just be dropped without a key to log in. <br /><br />http://www.martini.nu/blog/2010/06/tor-vbox.html sort of describes this, but just as a shell. You&#039;d have to write scala/python or other safe language scripts in the jail shell to access the menu. Lot&#039;s of options, SCP over your symmetric encrypted AES256 container with your order information, avoid PGP completely. Could also just write an IRC or jabber bot to take orders and host a hidden channel if you know what you&#039;re doing. <br /><br />Technically, you could use use regular telnet as well, and actually use real BBS software that&#039;s still around if you were insane enough to do this. Since Tor connections are already encrypted doesn&#039;t really matter if you Telnet out of tails to the board.

				I think you can tap 300 baud modem traffic with a stethoscope.&nbsp; &nbsp; Love the post, though.&nbsp; &nbsp; Reminds me of the opening lines of William Gibson&#039;s Johnny Mnemonic, &quot;if they think you&#039;re technical, go crude&quot;:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think you&#039;re crude, go technical; if they think you&#039;re technical, go crude. I&#039;m a very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible. These days, thought, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness. I&#039;d had to turn both those twelve-gauge shells from brass stock, on the lathe, and then load then myself; I&#039;d had to dig up an old microfiche with instructions for hand- loading cartidges; I&#039;d had to build a lever-action press to seat the primers -all very tricky. But I knew they&#039;d work. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Great replies guys...&nbsp; all on point -&nbsp; ECC, I always think on the reverse too&nbsp; :)<br /><br />and comsec, you blew my mind...&nbsp; now I might want to be insane enough to make what you said just to see the cheesy color ASCII graphics store front &#039;Welcome to the Burlap Road !!!&#039;<br /><br />
