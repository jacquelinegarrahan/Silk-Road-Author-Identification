				Can&#039;t figure out what it is... Know I didn&#039;t forget my password, and never accessed thru a different url so wasn&#039;t hacked.

				good.<br /><br />Haha but seriously, I suggest not ever doing that. There&#039;s multiple threads here explaining why. The bottom line is it isn&#039;t secure at all. Maybe try getting a cheap laptop.

				You&nbsp; have updated to a newer version of orweb browser which automatically blocks all cookies. Go to settings and select accept cookies (if you only use it for SR this isn&#039;t a problem; make sure you always check URL)<br /><br />Not getting into the whole using Tor on a phone debate; but I think you&#039;ll find that&#039;s why it isn&#039;t working

				Surely this applys to all ISP not just mobile providers? And if so it renders Tor fairly pointless.

				And as far as GPS goes, surely your phone is doing that whether or not you use it&nbsp; to access SR? An ordinary cellphone can also be used to track you from records of it pinging cell towers, but I&#039;m not sure how this information can be connected to your Silk Road account&nbsp; at the other end of three hops?<br />Of course, malicious software could be installed on your device and used to deanonymise you but isn&#039;t this also true of laptops? The only truly safe solution&nbsp; is a bootable cd or USB stick using tails or liberte.<br /><br />I have been playing with custom ROMs on my device, and I believe it is possible to install Ubuntu on an android device. You can also mount USB drives. I wonder if it would be possible to boot liberte on an android tablet? (Tails takes too much RAM I think?). Beyond my abilities I suspect but sure it could be done.
