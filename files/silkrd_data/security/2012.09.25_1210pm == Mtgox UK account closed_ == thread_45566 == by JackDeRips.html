				Just tried to make a deposit to MtGox and received this message. <br /><br />&#039;Payment rejected. Destination account closed. Your payment has been re-credited.&#039;<br /><br /><br />Has the account really been closed or is this temperamental?<br />

				I got the same problem too, but i didnt get any message... where did you get the message, in the mail? have you accesed gox through tor maybe? have you sent btcs into sr account? i&#039;m tring to figure out what it could be cause i &#039;ve always been very carfeul not to do the things i said before...<br />If you check the gox account funding menu you can see that theres a message about a new policy, it says that the bank can only accept 300 transaction a day so it advises not to tranfer money into the bank account on&nbsp; sunday and monday cause they start clearing orders on tuesday and doing so the tranfers add up and starts the problem...so i GUESS but i&#039;m not shure, that it could be that there&#039;s been already more than 300 transfers&nbsp; and the bank is rejecting ours... <br />If anyone could please enlighten us up about this issues it will be very nice indeed...<br />keep me informed please if ypu know something more...<br />regards<br />PPfield<br />
