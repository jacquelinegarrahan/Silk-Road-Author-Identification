				If your using the Tor Browser bundle you just need to delete the app to hide everything. Make sure to delete GPG Keychain Access if you have it installed also. <br /><br />Or if you want to do a whole restore. Get the System Restore DVD and restart into that. You can click in the top menu bar Utilities &gt; Disk Utility I believe.<br /><br />Select your hard drive then go to the erase tab. Then click Security Options down the bottom and select most secure. And that will completely wipe everything you have on your Mac :)<br />

				Wipe your Silk Road stuff with a file shredder with multiple passes to be safe.

				Use SecureErase. Or failing that, DBAN. Multiple passes e.g. 48.&nbsp; 8 is the smallest number you should do. Better to go whole hog.<br /><br />If you want uber-security, do the above, then go get a hammer, unscrew and smash your HD to pieces, and then drop the pieces into a river or into a water filled sink and then out to several different trashcans in the neighborhood.

				This is why you use TrueCrypt to begin with. You could have the world&#039;s most incriminating computer and nothing could be gained. No need to wipe or restore anything (though it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea to anyway).

You need to have used it from the start. <br /><br />Here&#039;s what to do, for you:<br /><br />1. Back up your (non-incriminating) personal files.<br /><br />2. Wipe your entire HD with DBAN. Use DoD 5220.22-M (7 passes). It will take a few hours. If you&#039;re very paranoid, after DBAN finishes, run it again.<br /><br />3. Reinstall your OS (hopefully the disc came with your computer), and then add your personal data back.<br /><br />4. Install TrueCrypt. Use a STRONG password that you don&#039;t and will never use for ANYTHING ELSE.<br /><br />5. You may want to set up a hidden partition in the future, for SR and other incriminating stuff. But don&#039;t do it while you still have scrutiny on your computer.
