				Title says it all.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to get a shipping destination to use that has no name/address/or anything that could be traced back to me.<br /><br />The problem with PO boxes (in the US at least) is they require ID &amp; a physical address to get one.&nbsp; Ok seems simple, get a fake ID and just use a fake non real address.&nbsp; You could use a real address of whoever but if somehow they send something related to your PO Box to said physical address, renewal notices, or whatever, that would be a security risk especially if they end up with a package containing drugs.&nbsp; But also suppose they try to verify a non-existing physical address you gave them and find out it doesn&#039;t exist - that could lead to a red flag on the PO Box and more investigation into the question - another security risk.<br /><br />Is there some way you can rent a private mailbox without having to provide a physical address?&nbsp; Am I missing some obvious solutions?<br /><br />What do ya&#039;ll think is the best way to get an address that is not traceable or at least extremely/improbably difficult to trace?

				you could use the street address of an apartment complex without specifying the apartment number, it will check out as valid and mail to it will not be deliverable to anyone.

To quote the SR Buyer&#039;s guide<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Use a different, unrelated address than the one where your item will be kept such as a friends house or P.O. box. Once the item arrives, transport it discretely to its final destination. Avoid abandoned buildings or any place where it would be suspicious to have mail delivered.<br /><br />Do not sign for your package. If you are expecting a package from us, do not answer the door for the postman, let him leave it there and then transport it as described above. Do not use your real name. This tactic doesn&#039;t work in some places because deliveries won&#039;t be made to names not registered with the address. If you think this is a problem, send your self a test letter with the fake name and see if it arrives.<br /><br />If you follow these guidelines, your chances of being detected are minimal. In the event that you are detected, deny requesting the package. Anyone can send anyone else anything in the mail. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So you might want to open a PO box in your own name, and then once it gets there, pick it up as soon as you can. Also, try getting some legit mail delivered to your PO box too. Try to not let your PO box become your &quot;shady&quot; mailbox though. I also suggest having it delivered to a friend&#039;s house.
