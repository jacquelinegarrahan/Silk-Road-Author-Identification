				OK, suppose you use a computer to surf to a deep net website, first the ISP will log your activity by your IP (supplied by your ISP), then log your MAC ID, which you can change.<br /><br />Tor exit nodes also leave your IP vulnerable too. And public anonymous proxies might also log your real IP.<br /><br />So other than real IP, proxy logs, exit nodes, and MAC number, what other elements make one trackable?

				Online methods:<br /><br />- rip facebook cookies out of a browser from your honeypot/sting site (how they unmasked China&#039;s hacking team)<br />- java exploits (not javascript, java plugins), PDF or some other direct file download like DCC on IRC<br />- traffic analysis like grep&#039;ing the logs of ISPs looking for direct Tor connections or a VPN IP you know is the person of interest<br />- reprogramming aircards/3G internet sticks of suspects to unmask and locate them<br />- directional analysis of wi-fi signals <br />- MITM attacks by running malicious exit nodes<br />- intimidating some cloud service like Gmail to give up your info and emails<br />- various browser and kernel exploits (illegal in some countries, used heavily in Germany and UK)<br />- software manufacturer hands feds exploits to use before they patch them (leaked by Snowden, microsoft does this)<br />- looking at your google search history, or bing search history, or feeding you tracking cookies.<br /><br />How to avoid: Use something like obfsproxy3 or a VPN to hide your traffic from local analysis. Use Tor browser only and don&#039;t go to any links people feed you, use Tails or virtual machine to limit exploit damage. Assume all SSL is compromised and don&#039;t use any sites that aren&#039;t .onion for business. Use end to end encryption and don&#039;t trust Hushmail or Countermail. Stop using closed source software like OSX and Windows. Install everything recommended here for regular browsing (don&#039;t add anything to Torbrowser though)<br /><br />http://donttrack.us/<br />http://fixtracking.com/<br />http://dontbubble.us/<br /><br />Social Engineering methods:<br /><br />- confidential informants, usually people you work with who got busted and roll on you for a lighter sentence<br />- insisting on sending cash for a huge order, playing off vendor greed<br />- offering to trade items for product like a pill press or anything they can put a tracking device into<br />- offering &quot;security services&quot; like a VPN or to set you up a store/server<br />- becoming your friend and waiting for you to drop enough intel on yourself with your guard down to find you<br /><br />How to avoid: trust nobody ever, even if they&#039;ve bought off you for 10 years with no problems. Always accept only bitcoins for payment. Don&#039;t take any trades, don&#039;t talk about yourself or operations ever. Go on youtube and search for &quot;OPSEC For Hackers&quot; by the grugq and watch the entire video.<br /><br />Passive intel collecting methods:<br /><br />- if you have 300+ posts here you probably gave away enough points of intel they can narrow down a search<br />- watching what you say here or on IRC or anywhere else you&#039;ve used the same handle/nym for intel<br />- analyzing this entire forum which they are already doing<br /><br />How to avoid: Watch the grugq Opsec for Hackers video, stop talking about your operations, stop using this forum like it&#039;s facebook or a reddit circlejerk and dropping intel constantly about yourself.<br /><br />Post office interception/controlled delivery:<br /><br />- order drugs, get the tracking number and have postal inspector hold package. Find some excuse to inspect for drugs or attach tracking device and return it to sender claiming insufficient postage hoping vendor goes and picks it up.<br />- order or find drugs, check for fingerprints, hairs, DNA any forensic evidence. check printed labels for hidden serial numbers they can match up to sales records. <br />- check sending post office if vendor was stupid enough to go in person and mail it on camera<br />- hold everything sent from that address or post office for analysis for drugs and forensic analysis<br />- use their standard methods to detect drugs like &quot;Oh, a California express prepaid box. Let&#039;s make up an excuse to open this&quot;<br />- find drugs, bust whoever is picking it up, turn them informant. see above section on social engineering<br />- check all addresses to see if they are fake, now have cause to open package.<br /><br />How to avoid: Use a fake address that&#039;s real, like an apartment with no unit #, a business but add on a fake unit #, not an obvious address that doesn&#039;t exist. Only use drop boxes with anonymous payment. Don&#039;t be greedy and go get a package that was returned if you have access to the address. Don&#039;t get sloppy with packs and leave fingerprints or badly seal the dope causing dogs to flag it. Switch up where you mail stuff from, don&#039;t use overnight service they always flag it.<br /><br />Wholesale surveillance and traffic patterns to identify networks<br /><br />- packet inspection of BGP routers/backbones for mass analysis<br />- forcing backdoors into all proprietary software like Skype<br />- exploiting backdoors left by inept manufacturers who use them in routers and other blackboxes for maintenance or tech support<br />- hiring non government contractors run by ex CIA and NSA to scrape social networks en masse and then analyze for hidden networks, writing styles, ect. <br />- buying software like this http://www.ntrepidcorp.com/tartan.php to do the above<br />- NIST recommending inferior random number generation in encryption standards as a backdoor: http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115 <br />- operating surveillance drones<br />- operating gigantic networks of surveillance cameras<br />- Using Stingray fake cell towers to intercept cellphones<br />- Mass spying of all telecoms and ISPs as per snowden leaks<br /><br />How to avoid: end to end encryption using only open source programs. Only using open source operating systems. Not trusting blackboxes or anything proprietary. Running your own firewalls and routers with openbsd or linux instead of buying a blackbox. Not using facebook. Never using your real name online ever. Not using credit cards or other traceable payment methods for business items like label printers or vac sealers. Aluminum tin foil hat to block the drone mind control :) :) :)<br /><br />I probably missed a thousand other methods<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				ya know the way most people get caught up by LE or other government nets is by their own doing/ stupidity. the best thing to do is keep your mouth shut. say nothing to anyone not supremely vetted. Never discuss SR. Never. be smart in your movements. change travel patterns often. dont go to the same McDonalds everytime you want to get on SR or other HiddenServices. dont get fucked up and pulled over in a vehicle. dont beat your kids/ wife/ neighbor and get the cops called to your house. Dont smoke weed in the car, probable cause is a MOFO.

				Bravo and thanks to comsec!&nbsp; Sticky that post!<br /><br />All I can add is that I am confident that the number one reason people get busted is by opening their mouth.&nbsp; Try to keep that in mind at all times.&nbsp; This country is fucked at any number of levels, but the whole &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; thing is a glorious right to have (for now).&nbsp; <br /><br />Prosecutors need mountains of circumstantial evidence to equal just one stupid thing you said that indicates guilt, or to be equal to eyewitness testimony (rat).&nbsp; So if TSHTF, shut up and make them do all the work on building that mountain of circumstantial evidence.<br /><br />I am pretty misanthropic, but with a decent defense attorney, I feel pretty good about my odds when being judged by a jury of my peers.
