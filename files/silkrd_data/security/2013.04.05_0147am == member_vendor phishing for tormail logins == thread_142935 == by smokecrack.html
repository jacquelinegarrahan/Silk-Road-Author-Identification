Gone sour with something by the looks of things. Asked people to FE which is now against the rules. Lol, locked himself out of his account and had to reset PIN? Really? Yeah, looks like a bee in his bonnet past vendor who might well think it&#039;s amusing to take out past frustration on forum members never involved in his issues to begin with,. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.<br /><br />No seriously what are the addresses? http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion is the correct one to use.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				This guy is just here to cause trouble. Thanks again for bringing this up. ALWAYS bring this stuff up. (+K) The correct address for TorMail&#039;s SquirrelMail service is:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/squirrelmail/src/login.php<br /><br />........... and not:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjltwc23w5fb.onion<br /><br />And the correct address for TorMail&#039;s Roundcube service is:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube<br /><br />........... and not:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjljtqrtkr7t.onion<br /><br />Notice the difference between his addresses and the proper ones. They don&#039;t even look legitimate when you really look at them. If the address is not the main page, how could it be this short?&nbsp; The main page for TorMail is http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion. So naturally any link within this page should have this in the next link. Roundcube and SquirrelMail both contain the original address, just like Silk Road forums contain the original address. The links merely provide extended info in the addy. Look at it this way and you will never be phised again, so long as you know the original addy. Even if you didn&#039;t, I can tell you it is too short for a link inside a site. The two false addresses he gave you both go to phising pages that are identical to the real ones, Just the addresses are different. <br /><br />This guy is an asshole. He is taking his issues with admin, whatever they were (he locked himself out of his acc./ ::) ) on us, who have not even heard of him. Any future contact from this person, let us know about it. And any incorrect addies being passed out on the forums, also let us know about that as well so he doesn&#039;t phise anyone.<br /><br />Have a good day, mate.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
