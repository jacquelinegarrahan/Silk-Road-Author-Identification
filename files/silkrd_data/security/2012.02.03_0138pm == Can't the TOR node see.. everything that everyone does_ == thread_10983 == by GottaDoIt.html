				This might be a stupid question. But doesn&#039;t the last TOR node see everything you purchase, the address its sent to, the passwords used for SR, etc.? Or have I missed something?

Silk Road is a hidden service that exists only within the Tor network, which means that all traffic to and from the site is encrypted by default.

				each node in the network only knows the previous and next nodes (also a counter telling it how many more hops to make), typically a tor connection is bounced off 3 nodes. each node has a different encryption key, this prevents your information/position leaking in transit. <br /><br />so to answer your question the last node does know every thing you are sending to the sr server, but it also happens that the last node is the sr server. :)

How can you log in if the site can&#039;t see your password?&nbsp; :P<br />Most importantly, though, the last node can&#039;t see your IP.

But that&#039;s why you want to connect to these sites via https - that way, not even the middleman (the last tor node, but also any othe rproxy you happen to be using) can see the data. At least not without a little bit of dirty work.

				If you are absolutely paranoid, positively paranoid, and never in a hurry ( Page loads are very Looooong). Pay for a portable VPN service that has multiple geographic launch points. Be choosy, pick a VPN service that uses advanced encryption like L2TP. The one I use has 7:<br /><br />Three North American<br />Two European<br />Two Asian.<br /><br />Go to a starbucks/hotel/airport with open Wi-Fi<br /><br />Connect to your VPN that gives you an IP block from let&#039;s say: Los Angeles, or Paris.<br />Ensure all your traffic is routed through your VPN<br />Start your TOR session. Ta-Da, any backtrace to your first hop will only be to your VPN.&nbsp;
