				I had the same thought as you when first asked to use Privnote, so did some research. In brief my conclusion was that either the site is totally compromised and run by some federal organisation, or its pretty safe, depends whether I have my paranoia mode on full.<br /><br />The technology it uses is a reasonably secure concept - the url that is generated is in two parts, one is the actual address of the note, and the other is an encryption key. They say they dont store the urls themselves, so their servers only contain encrypted data with no keys to decode it.<br /><br />They also say that they dont record any IP addresses, so your notes should not be traceable back to you, which also means they shouldnt be able to prove that it was actually you who sent your address to some SR vendor rather than your malicious stalker looking to incriminate you.<br /><br />There is https://certified.privnote.com/ which is the &quot;Europrise&quot; certified version of Privnote, means it has the European Privacy Seal issued by an EU organisation. Again this won&#039;t reassure you if you have max paranoia since then you have to assume the feds have control of everything.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldnt use it for high risk/value business (if I did any) but I have used it for small SR purchases.

				&nbsp;Privnote.com is currently hosted at Rackspace Hosting.<br />&nbsp;The IP 174.143.172.154 links to a server in San Antonio, United States.<br />&nbsp;The company behind this all is Slicehost<br /><br />&nbsp;The privnote.com server is powered by Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) webserver software<br />&nbsp;The developers of Privnote have built the app by using Django and Python<br /><br />- perhaps stick with gpg / pgp as already suggested.<br />

				So here&#039;s what happens when you create a note in Privnote:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You write the note and click the POST button<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server generates a random note id, let&#039;s call it the NoteID. This is the 16 chars ID you see in the note link<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server hashes the note ID and gets a HashedNoteID = Hash(NoteID). We&#039;re currently using SHA-1 as the hashing algorithm, but the particular algorithm is not very important here<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server encrypts the note contents (and also the email and reference, if there is any) using the NoteID, and stores the encrypted version in the database using the HashedNoteID as the database primary key<br /><br />If someone with access to the database would like to read the note she would be unable because she doesn&#039;t have the key to decrypt it (NoteID), only the database primary key (HashedNoteID). The HashedNoteID cannot be used to &quot;go back&quot; to the NoteID because hashes are &quot;one-way&quot;. So the only person who can actually decrypt (and thus see) the note is the one who has the original NoteID or, in other words, the one who has the link to the note.<br /><br />For completeness, this is what happens when you view a note in Privnote:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server extracts the NoteID from the URL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server hashes the NoteID and gets the HashedNoteID. This is the same HashedNoteID used when generating the note, since the NoteID used to make the hash is the same in both cases<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server retrieves the note from the database using HashedNoteID as the database primary key and decrypts its contents using NoteID as the encryption key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server shows the page with the decrypted note<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The server permanently deletes the note from the database, keeping only a record of the HashedNoteID, the time when it was read, and the IP address where it was read from, to show it when someone tries to see the note again<br />

				I had a new buyer send me their privnote link as a way for me to get their address and I refused to accept it... am I being paranoid?<br /><br />Something that forces me to connect to an external URL so that I can obtain an address seems like a great way for L.E. to identify sellers...&nbsp; again am I being paranoid?

				A privnote can only be read once. If someone&#039;s note has already been read when the intended recipient opens it, they know that something&#039;s off.<br /><br />Other than that, don&#039;t assume privnote is secure. PGP is best.

Safe-mail intercepts the e-mail and replace Alices public key with their own then send it on to Bob. Bob sends Alice his public key and safe-mail does the same thing. Now when Bob encrypts to Alice he is really encrypting to safe-mail, who then can decrypt the message and re-encrypt it (or a modified version of it) with Alices real public key before sending it to Alice. <br /><br />I really worry the most about instant messages and OTR. I think it would be very trivial for any of the instant message servers we use (or SILC server etc) to MITM OTR keys, and so few people use any authentication / verification methods that it would not likely be noticed. <br /><br />I have thought of putting out a few exit nodes that SSL strip connections to popular instant message servers and MITM OTR key transfers, just for shits and giggles. I bet I would be able to intercept a lot of communications that people thought were secure. But I am not an asshole so I wont :).

				Yes, for quick communications involving newly generated keys, mitm is a significant threat.<br /><br />But in terms of SR, where vendors post their public key and keep them forever, mitm is pretty useless.
