				safe-mail is shit. Not only does it tell everybody when you&#039;re online so they can profile you it doesn&#039;t even work half the time.<br />I personally don&#039;t trust SSL cert authorities, so at least with tormail you have better encryption instead of exiting through a tor node running this: http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/

				Neither (although tormail a bit more, because it stays inside Tor). You&#039;ll never know what either provider will do with your mail, so I wouldn&#039;t trust them with it (unless it contains nothing of interest or is all encrypted).

				Personally, I like the big FUCK YOU which is directed towards authority on tormail&#039;s start page:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Notice to Officials - Abuse Complaints<br /><br />This web site is just an informational web page.<br />None of Tor Mail&#039;s mail systems are hosted on this server, or on any server that you can find the IP address.<br />Siezing or shutting down this web site will have no effect on Tor Mail&#039;s services.<br /><br />Tor Mail consists of several servers, a Tor hidden service, and an incoming and outgoing internet facing mail servers.<br />These internet facing mail servers are relays, they relay mail in and out of the Tor network, they are disposable servers purchased anonymously and not tracable to us.<br />The only thing stored on the hard drive of those servers is the Exim mail server, and the Tor software. <br />No emails or logs or anything important are stored on those servers, thus it doesn&#039;t matter if they are seized or shut down.<br />We are prepared to quickly replace any relay that is taken offline for any reason.<br /><br />The Tor Mail hidden service and SMTP/IMAP/POP3 are on a hidden server completely seperate from the relays, the relays do not know the IP of the hidden service.<br />Tor Mail does not co-operate with anyone attempting to identify or censor a Tor Mail user.<br /><br />Tor Mail&#039;s goal is to provide completely anonymous and private communications to anyone who needs it.<br />We are anonymous and cannot be forced to reveal anything about a Tor Mail user.<br /><br />You can only sign up and access Tor Mail via our Tor Hidden Service, we do not ask for any identifying information such as name or address, our service is free so we do not have billing information and tor hidden services cannot see your IP so we have no way to identify any user.<br /><br />We have no information to give you or to respond to any subpeona&#039;s or court orders.<br />Do not bother contacting us for information on, or to view the contents of a Tor Mail user inbox, you will be ignored.<br /><br />If you wish to contact us for any reason, you may send an email to click here to reveal email address.&quot;

Suffice it to say that Tormail is set up in such a way that intercepting e-mails by third parties is virtually impossible - however if you want to be certain of your privacy, suggest using PGP to encrypt your messages as Wretched says - that way even if there&#039;s a mole in Tormail, they&#039;ll only be able to intercept protected messages.<br /><br />If you need a more convenient way to speak to people there are a number of messaging applications than can be run through Tor and use encryption - Pidgin with the OTR plugin is good - I have just been introduced to Psi+ which can import PGP keys for each user, saving you the trouble of having to encrypt messages each time.<br /><br />V.

				That&#039;s not entirely true - their welcome page which contains no information about individual Tor users may have been compromised but that wouldn&#039;t do any good if you wanted to trace individual users.<br /><br />Of course using PGP to encrypt your messages is also essential - that way even if a corrupt Tormail admin were to leak the location of their servers all they could hand over is your encrypted inbox. <br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16968.msg169645#msg169645">Quote from: Ronind on March 30, 2012, 02:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">tormail was hacked since the afternoon yesterday...i thought you guys would have noticed that!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I guess tormail wins over safe-mail if you read through the thread.<br /><br />Still, sometimes you may not have access to TOR (on another computer or whatever) and maybe you are in grave need of getting access to your mail.<br /><br />In that case, I have some hopes on the quite new https://countermail.com/<br />It&#039;s created by some like-minded people to be used as a safe-mail. They&#039;ve done some nice security measures. Their USB-key alternative to security makes it even more interesting. It&#039;s worth a look!
