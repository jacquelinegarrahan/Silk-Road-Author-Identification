				Hey i want to dban my macbook pro,&nbsp; does it work for mac too? I need to wipe out my HDD before i sell my computer. Is there any other application for macbook that does the same in case that dban does not work?<br /><br />Sorry for asking such a stupid question, but when it comes to security to just want to take the extra mile and be 100% sure, plus im kind of paranoid.<br /><br />Thanks for readin, have a nice day

				Been a while since I&#039;ve done it but I thought dban v2 (think it was called beta at the time) should &quot;just work&quot;&nbsp; Burn the iso to a disc, hold down option key and power on macbook, choose dban from list of boot devices.&nbsp; If you have a macbook without a cd drive you can try to make a bootable usb stick.&nbsp; Alternatively you can use the mac&#039;s built in partition shredder. I think you hold down R and reboot and goes to recovery area where you can launch disk utility and have it securely erase partition (although my guess is it doesn&#039;t wipe, say, the recovery partition otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be able to run the recovery programs).<br /><br />Depending on how sensitive the data is/was and with the price of hard drives, just destroy the physical drive.&nbsp; Find a local place that will shred the physical hard drive or drill a bunch of holes through it and let is sit in a bowl of your favorite carbonated beverage (all the sugars and such are not good for the aluminum platters).&nbsp; Or take the drive apart to get access to the really powerful magnets in them.&nbsp; Or whip up some thermite and melt the thing.<br /><br />And I expect the next question may be &quot;what level do I use?&quot;&nbsp; Honestly, for 99% of the cases, just writing zeros to the entire drive is sufficient.&nbsp; At that point someone would have to take the drive to a clean room, carefully disassemble it, and use expensive equipment to try and recover the data.&nbsp; If this situation feels like a real possibility I&#039;d go for the physical destruction of it.&nbsp; Otherwise go for the next level up (3 or 5 pass, forget how many) and consider it irrecoverable.
