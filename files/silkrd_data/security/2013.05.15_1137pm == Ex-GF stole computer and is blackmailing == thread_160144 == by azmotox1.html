				Are/were you a vendor?&nbsp; If you were, I&#039;d really worry.&nbsp; You can never trust those women scorned.&nbsp; I would schmooze her to get it back and then run like hell in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Any girl like that can be your worst nightmare.

				Hire some crack addict to break in and dump the thing in a tub of water or negotiate if possible to see if shell sell it back to you or trade or something. I am guessing if she is &quot;psycho&quot; she wont really be the negotiating type...<br /><br />Maybe even get a buddy of yours who she doesn&#039;t know to get her drunk &quot;meet her&quot; and get invited over then once hes inside have him destroy it...If/when diplomacy fails you&#039;ll have to resort to these kind of tactics, i worry about this with my girl everyday. Cross your fingers and treat your girl right or you could get fucked i guess best policy is never to tell them anything ever, but its to late for some of us to do that now...

In fact how can she prove that the HDD is his? He only has TOR on it.<br /><br />Think about it. This way, anyone could frame anyone they have a grudge on.<br /><br />I hate my boss right? So I buy a HDD, copy lots of his photos and shit on it, and download tor and conduct some illegal business on silkroad and then call the police and say I stole my boss&#039; computer and he has a lot of drug shit on it.<br />Instead of my boss, you can think of any other living person, doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s your boss/your friend/your boyfriend/girlfriend/neighbour/monkey WHATEVER. It was just an example.<br /><br />Now what do you think is gonna happen?<br /><br />First off, they will probably ask you why you stole the computer if it was his private property. And this is like turning yourself in for stealing. GOOD. They will add a theft charge and will arrest you. Then they will interrogate you to see what the fuck is up with you and why you are admitting to stealing a computer. Then they will also have to investigate the other claim you have made. They will have a hard time figuring out whose PC that is. It&#039;s not like a hard drive has anybody&#039;s fingerprints on it. There&#039;s no way by looking at a hard drive to know who it belongs to.<br /><br />So they&#039;ll go up to your boss and ask him if his computer got stolen. He will obviously say &quot;no, what the hell are you talking about&quot;; but it doesn&#039;t matter what he says, he will be called in to give a statement. They will ask him if he knows you and if he has any idea why you would claim such things about him. <br /><br />Again, your boss/friend/whatever can say: &quot;Yeah I know this guy, he&#039;s a fucking psycho he once threatened me to beat me up and I&#039;m trying to avoid him. He hates me for whatever reason&quot;.<br /><br />Now back to your psycho ex-girlfriend. You won&#039;t get charged with anything and your psycho bitch will get arrested or have a misdemeanor thrown in. She&#039;s gonna come out as the psycho who denounced herself and admitted stealing your computer, you won&#039;t.<br /><br />So I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Unless you&#039;re sure they CAN actually determine that it was indeed your hard drive. Either that or if you have some pictures or addresses of people or drug contacts etc. Those will get investigated. But if the only thing you have on it is TOR then you&#039;re probably safe.<br /><br />This is why you should always keep your hard drive encrypted though.<br /><br />One more thing. Did you ever keep stuff like vendor pictures/drug contacts/addresses/whatever on your PC but then deleted it and thought you had erased them completely? If that&#039;s the case I&#039;ll have you know you have to format your hard drive with at least 2 passes of zeroes to it for it to be considered &quot;safe&quot; and not even then, I&#039;d recommend at least 3-4-5 pass formatting. Deleted files aren&#039;t really deleted.<br /><br />Now unless you give me more info I cannot determine the correct course of action for you.

				I agree with Libertas.&nbsp; What is she asking for?&nbsp; That means a lot in this situation.&nbsp; If she has a dollar amount pay it if you can, but I assume she wants whatever happened between you not to have happened.&nbsp; In that case you need to take it all back, tell her you love her, and tell her you want to get together.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever you need to do to get that computer box back, even if it means eating her box.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; I recommend exhausting all options before you risk adding breaking and entering, burglary, and possibly assault if someone is there to your theoretical drug charges.

				If you&#039;ve never sold anything on SR then she and the police can both suck your dick :).<br /><br />And even if you sold stuff, they won&#039;t be able to prove it was actually you. Unless you still keep drugs @ your house. <br /><br />But that would mean never dealing again :(

				Why have you not encrypted your computer?<br />This is a huge security risk and why the have you enlightened your psycho girlfriend about your SR business?<br />You have one thing to do now, get your computer back.Force yourself into her home and get it.<br /><br />If you are a vendor you deserve a kick in the nuts for being so insecure and stupid.

				Five, simple points:<br /><br />#1. If anyone other than you has physical access to your computer, always use whole disk encryption (like TrueCrypt) with a strong passphrase. ALWAYS.<br />#2. Using anything other than a strong magnetic field to try to erase or kill a hard disk is a waste of time. Three words: large, neodymium magnet. Just watch your fingers.<br />#3. If you have Tor installed, but no bookmarks, use Tormail for e-mail and no one knows your passwords, you most likely have nothing to worry about here.<br />#4. If #3 is right, then you can either do nothing, or report your computer stolen. If LE initiates a search on your computer without establishing probable cause, most of the evidence can be tossed.<br />#5. Never try to negotiate with a psycho ex-girlfriend.

				Cant you blackmail her back? Dont you have some personal photos of her or something haha? Or why not just order some drugs to her address and tip of the police.. then she will try to blame the computer on u but it will look like she is just trying to defend herself with bullshit. <br /><br />Or if you have any personal items of her wear gloves and post some weed with fibres of her clothing in to a government official haha that would fuck her up.. <br /><br />Idk reverse blackmail seems like a good way or break into her house and take it back! it really depends what you have talked to her about on clearnet or txt to whether she wud be able to proof u did anything. <br /><br />If my ex did that first thing I would do is threaten to send her family members are home made porn videos then upload them to porn hub or something.. do it all anon as if some hacker managed to get it out of your computer so in court it comes down to her word against yours cuz u can get in serious trouble for that shit. <br /><br />Ex boyfriends gettin jealous of their ex girlfriend havin a new bloke and posting pics have ended up in jail in the UK..<br /><br />What a fucking bitch tho!

He has learned that you have to prepare for the worst but still hope for the best. He got very luck on a couple of fronts. The laptop was not in his name, but it was in his possesion which made him call his dog. Now this is the planning for the worst. If you are gonna play this game, regardless if your a buyer or seller. You have to prepare for the worst if your not comfortable with high stress. This means save money and find a law dog you trust. You don&#039;t have to explain what&#039;s happening up front. Just put them on retainer with about 5k so when and if the shit hits the fan you have someone other than personal contacts to get you out. Trust that this is enormous. You will be amazed how quickly the people you think you can trust and say they care about you will suddenly be ghosts. Well I guess you can imagine that being your girlfriend turned on you, huh?<br /><br />Now is there any chance you can be calm and regain her trust? You really have to make an uncomfortable situation better by playing her game. At least you do if you are concerned about this. If not, fuck her, she has the laptop and could have had it the entire time, right? You did buy this for her as a gift, right? hint ;)<br /><br />If your unable to just relax and let it go then you need to kiss ass and get her trust back. These fucked up bitches do it all the time, now it&#039;s your chance to do it back. Just remember it is their game that they have been playing all their life, so you have to be good at it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Keep your head up, if all you said is true you really have nothing to worry about, but I am very curious as are others. What the hell does she want from you?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thank you everyone for all your advice! I will give everyone +1 when I have the time :]<br /><br />Anyways, I have still not gotten my computer back but after learning she really had nothing on me (considering I have 0 bookmarks, 0 saved usernames, passcoded) I am not worried. <br /><br />I eventually told her she can have the damn computer and then she realized she had no more &quot;handle&quot; on me, and softened up. I am sure she will give it back soon but I won&#039;t pressure her for it because it&#039;s not worth getting her worked up again and myself as well.<br /><br />Lesson learned: Trust no hoe!&nbsp; 8)

				Without giving too much personal info, I have a background in criminal law.&nbsp; So here is the quick version of my opinion with the limited information I have seen.<br /><br />First, blackmail is a FELONY in most states.&nbsp; What she is doing is VERY illegal.&nbsp; She is trying to use knowledge for personal gain at your expense.&nbsp; People seem to think it is legal to do this when the other person (alleged) committed a crime.<br /><br />Do not say anything further to her.&nbsp; Don&#039;t talk about what is on the computer...it is none of her business.&nbsp; Also, since the computer has been in her control, it casts doubt on anything it contains.&nbsp; Moreover, she has already shown malicious and illegal intent.<br /><br />Say nothing...do nothing!&nbsp;

She may try to record it any take it out of context. Circumstantial evidence may not get you in jail but it isn&#039;t worth the hassle.<br />Hopefully you will live long enough to apply what you learned.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;....wake up....<br />As for your life like others have said here: Compartmentalization.
