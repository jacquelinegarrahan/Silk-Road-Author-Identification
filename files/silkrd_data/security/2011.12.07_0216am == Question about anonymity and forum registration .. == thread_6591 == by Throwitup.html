				So, i made an account here on the forums .. then i forgot my password .. not the first time, i rarely post here and consider forum identities as being disposable ..<br /><br /><br />Anyways.. to the point ...<br />I made two forum accounts today, and the second time (a few hours after the first one) i got a message saying something to the tune of &quot;Sorry you can only make one account from a computer at a time&quot;<br /><br />So, i brainstormed and remembered my previous username/password ...&nbsp; <br /><br />but my question now is : HOW DOES IT KNOW ?!??!&nbsp; i thought this was anonymous.<br />I even tried the &quot;use a new identity&quot; in vidalia .. still same thing :( <br /><br />and that brings me to another question that i have been pondering ...<br />when browsing the SR marketplace (logged in of course), and then you click &quot;use a new identity&quot; (some people have said this is a &quot;tip&quot; to try if TOR is being particularly slow) <br />... how come you don&#039;t have to log in again ? how does it know it is still the same user ?<br /><br />is there some kind of &quot;signature&quot; for your browser, and/or each login peroid ? <br /><br />hoping someone can clear this up.

				The Dr is of course, correct.<br /><br />When you &#039;change identities&#039; in Tor, it doesn&#039;t clear your cookies, and that check is built into the forum software. If you either manually cleared your cookies, or shut down and restarted you browser during which torbutton clears any tor based cookies, it wouldn&#039;t have had a clue.

				thanks Doc,<br />&amp; to VJ as well.<br /><br />i feel better now.<br /><br />that is more or less what i thought at first, but after a second thought ... i figured it couldn&#039;t hurt to ask.<br /><br />in retrospect, i think it was the wording that threw me off. it didn&#039;t sound very anonymous...i wasn&#039;t expecting that.<br /><br />(maybe the powers that be would see fit to change it to something like &quot;You already have an account. If you don&#039;t like it, clear yo&#039; cookies/restart your browser and try again, foo !&quot;)
