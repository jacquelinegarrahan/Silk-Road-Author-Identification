				I&#039;m presently getting ready to use SR. So far I&#039;ve got TOR, an SR account and GPG. The most difficult part for me is to purchase bitcoins anonymously, since I live in Sweden, but I&#039;ve got a plan. First I am thinking I will make a wallet on blockchain.info, then I will set up a proxy for IRC so I can be 100% anonymous (I use SSL), and hopefully find a Swedish seller (I&#039;ve had no success in that yet, but I have a good feeling). I will then ask the seller to transfer the coins to my blockchain.info wallet (in exchange for a bank deposit to his/her account), and I will use blockchain&#039;s mixing service (in case my seller is under investigation I don&#039;t want to be cross-referenced), before sending the coins to my SR wallet. My questions are:<br /><br />1. Does this method seem safe to you all?<br />2. I s blockchain.info a fine choice of e-wallet?<br />3. Is blockchains mixing service reliable?<br />4. When I go to my wallet on blockchain, will I have to remember to always visit it with TOR browser? In other words, will I give away my identity if I accidentally visit the e-wallet using a regular broswer at some point?

				Just use this guide. All your answers are here for you:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46294.0<br /><br />blockchain is IMO the best wallet but follow the steps to launder your coins. All the info you need is in that thread I gave you above.

				Thank you. I did read the guide and I think my method would be a bit different than the one suggested because I don&#039;t live in USA, so the answer to my first question is still unclear to me. My second question is answered. The third question is not answered, unless I missed something in your guide. I didn&#039;t see you mentioning blockchain&#039;s mixing service. I think the answer to question four is that I always need to visit with the TOR broswer, but if anyone can tell me what happens if I forget I&#039;d appreciate it.

				I don&#039;t know if converting bitcoins like that is safe, though I wouldn&#039;t want to do that with any more money than I&#039;d feel comfortable losing. Also, aside from trusting the other party to give you bitcoins when they have your money, there&#039;s the issue of trusting them with your identity. Edit: realised you&#039;re just depositing to their account, not transferring, so you don&#039;t have the identity problem, just the scam risk.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about blockchain beyond having used their mixing service a couple of times, so I won&#039;t comment on your second question.<br /><br />But connecting outside of tor means the site you connect to will have your ip address, and so can potentially identify you. So probably better to just use tor. Of course, they can know you use tor, so that&#039;s something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Other people probably have more experience than I do, so might give better advice. But here&#039;s what I did. Being in europe it&#039;s possible to send a SEPA transfer to intersango (and mt. gox, but i think you need to be verified for that). They&#039;ll have your info, so connecting through tor isn&#039;t a good idea. Then I send to strongcoin, then through blockchain&#039;s mixing service (using tor) to a temporary wallet, then perhaps through another mixing service to silk road. One thing I haven&#039;t looked at properly is the amount of money transferred - I&#039;m thinking of keeping money in and out of mixing services to integer values to make them less unique and potentially identifiable, but I haven&#039;t investigated enough to know if that&#039;s a real concern or not. Edit: this probably is a concern, maybe bitlaundry is better. Anyway...<br /><br />Also, be careful of bitcoin services - I got burnt by torwallet. In the future I&#039;ll be doing smaller transfers to keep scam damage to a minimum.<br /><br />Anyway, this all might be overkill, unless buying to deal where you want as much secrecy as possible. If buying to consume, then I think excess bitcoin camouflage is probably just masturbation. Maybe fun, maybe helps relieve stress, but probably doesn&#039;t make a huge difference. The risk posed by the mailman putting a bag of drugs in your letterbox seems to outweigh bitcoin risk. Still, doesn&#039;t hurt.
