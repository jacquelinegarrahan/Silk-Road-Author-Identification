				Vendors are not allowed to store buyer information... But is has to be expected that some still do.<br /><br />Some might just think they&#039;ll never get caught, other don&#039;t know or don&#039;t care that their printer is capturing all printed data. Worst, some might keep them to use for negotiating deals with LE or to use for whatever shady business down the road.<br /><br />My guess is that DPR would lock an account it something like that happens, but not do much more.<br /><br />I personally think, its buyers responsibility to talk about what would happen, if a case like this should ever occur. And maybe even have some agreed upon actions to take. <br /><br />Right now, except for the ethical, there don&#039;t seem to be much of a downside for vendors in storing buyer data.<br /><br />Share your thoughts!

				well... there is some downside for the vendors by keeping buyers data, its some more evidence for the fact that they were selling and the more buyers - the more evidence,<br /><br />lets assume that LE arrest some vendor and reveals hes SR nickname - &quot;111112222&quot;<br />and the vendor gives hes buyers list. what does he achieve by this other than more potential people to testify they bought off him once they get interrogated?<br /><br />&quot;did you buy off 111112222?&quot;<br />&quot;ohh yeah mister officer im just a small time buyer, i bought some coke off 111112222 , and i dont know who he is.&quot;<br /><br />but once LE&nbsp; links 111112222 real identity to hes SR name, the more buyers they question - the more he gets fucked, some buyers will say nothing and some will say everything.<br /><br />other than realizing this problem, there is not much to be done against vendor storing Buyer Information, anyway it doesn&#039;t seem like a very smart move.<br />also i don&#039;t believe that anyone will want to trade their buyers details - that will fuck them for sure - maybe their suppliers details can get them some deal.<br /><br />i think that most details storing is due to vendor stupidity and its not good to any of the sides. and im pretty sure its not uncommon as one might think. and DRP cant do anything cause addressees gets deleted from SR anyway once the order is put in transit, and most storing is offline in shipping stages, labels, printers, excel files or whatever.

				the probability the seller is retaining a buyer&#039;s info, at least until package shows delivered (assuming he has shipped and isn&#039;t a scammer) is a major concern to me<br />the probability 50% or more sellers retain it longer is even more troublesome, whether they&#039;re retaining it out of stupidity, laziness or whatever, layers on more concern <br /><br />the well known vendors like norcalking, even though their prices are premium, give some feeling that they&#039;re smart enough to retain that info for the shortest period of time

				This is a problem which presents a difficult answer. I am doing some research and if I find any information I will let you know. Posting to sub as well.

				well, if the vendor is busted, odds are LE already knows his account and can proof it. And linking the drugs found to offers on the road... how hard can that be?! the account proofs that whatever amount of drugs has been sold. so keeping buyers data would only improve his position. <br /><br />there is stuff that can be done. Eg. creating a very obvious DOWNSIDE. Ive got some ideas, but would like to keep the topic open at this point. I think vendors might participate here as well, since it takes away what has to be the biggest problem to ordering in SR.<br /><br />Let me repeat, right now there is no downside for them. Losing their reputation is not really an argument. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think visiting all the buyers on the list is the biggest concern. Being placed in some hidden database has to be a bigger concern.<br /><br />DPR won&#039;t do anything. I think its something buyers need to get behind.

				A vendor who gets busted will be under a lot of pressure to turn over all info that he has. He would have to turn it over if he wants to sign a plea agreement. It&#039;s an unfortunate and dangerous situation for everyone, but if you have an open order or have recently made an order from a vendor who gets busted, expect that info to be compromised. Act like it has been, get a new shipping address, etc.<br /><br />For personal amounts it&#039;s unlikely they will go after you. When vendors in the Farmer&#039;s Market were busted, LE clearly got some of the customer information, because some US customers received warning letters from the DOJ, so it does happen. They may not send a letter every time, but be safe and act like they have your info. They will likely only go after people ordering large amounts, though.<br />

				i wish i was wrong i have been there too many times -&nbsp; ask any lawyer,&nbsp; telling on your buyers =&nbsp; telling on yourself.<br />telling on your dealer = might get you some deal.<br /><br />saying nothing at all is best :)<br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s not the point, its for another discussion - to the main topic - which is an important point -&nbsp; &nbsp;i believe that the best and only way to be really safe is use drop point and not your house, other than that, it sucks but nothing can be done to protect our details from being kept/shared&nbsp; -&nbsp; for whatever use they might be used.
