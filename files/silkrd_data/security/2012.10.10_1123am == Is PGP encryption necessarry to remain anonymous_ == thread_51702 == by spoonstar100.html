				I always assumed that it was absolutely necessary to use encryption on your sensitive details such as name and address. However one vendor seems to think it is a waste of time and a false security measure as silkroad apparently encrypts and then deletes all data sent through it, whereas any PGP encrypted message sent to a vendor may not be deleted and therefore is less safe.<br /><br />&quot;I fucking hate PGP - Please do not use PGP or privnote..! Addresses are automatically encrypted and deleted<br />through the SR system. However, if you want your address decrypted, copied and pasted into my documents,<br />and not automatically deleted after use - please feel free to continue relying on false security...&quot;<br /><br />The vendor is &#039;revenantchild&#039; here is a link to his page.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/e4f447f64a<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d just like to know if anyone else has an opinion on this as I&#039;ve googled it to no avail.<br /><br />Cheers.

				The encryption used by SR only offers any benefit at all if the server is not running when it is seized. This is unlikely, so using GPG is pretty much a must.

However, this vendor goes much, much further than that. It is nothing less than gross negligence to ask that their buyers not make use of either PGP or Privnote.&nbsp; Even their PGP key uses the old key format, abandoned more than 2 years before the key was generated, so it would appear that the vendor couldn&#039;t even be bothered to use up to date encryption software, let alone use it properly. <br /><br />My advice?

We don&#039;t know the kind of resources the authorities will have in years to come. We don&#039;t know how far they&#039;ll be willing to go to prosecute. When your freedom is at stake, the precautionary principle is well and truly justified.<br /><br />Paranoid...maybe! It&#039;s entirely your choice...A buyer not using PGP is silly. A seller not using PGP is suicide. I would not hand over any information (encrypted or not) to someone who refuses to understand elementary basics of cryptography. If a seller is not using PGP, I&#039;d simply make the assumption (right or wrong) that my address is not safe in their hands.<br /><br />The only thing you are in control of is the information you have encrypted using a password. The only thing tying you to a purchase is your address...treat it like your baby and never lend it to people you don&#039;t or can&#039;t trust.<br /><br />/rant<br /><br />And more importantly PEACE!

				Using PGP only helps you so much. Yeah, if the server is busted, you personal details are safe. However, what if your vendor gets busted? How do you know he hasnt just saved your unencrypted details on his computer? Unfortunately, there is no way to mitigate the latter threat.

				Spoonstar, <br /><br />The vendor is deceiving you into thinking that SR deletes everything and that Darknet &quot;just keeps everything encrypted&quot; <br /><br />I would find another source of whatever it is that your wanting and learn PGP to send your name and shipping address securely, directly to the one guy who knows a password at the other end of the communication, not just anyone who looks at his screen, or hacks his account (LE).

				Whether you use PGP or not; you are relying on the vendor to treat your address carefully. Once decrypted, he/she will copy paste it to somewhere to print it, and then hopefully destroy it. There&#039;s no way to avoid this as you want drugs sent to the address! However, using PGP ensures that no one but the vendor can read your address. If SR were to be compromised or your communication to be intercepted in any way, PGP encryption ensures your address is safe. I&#039;m not sure how this can be described as &quot;a false sense of security&quot;?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PGP might not protect you against a careless or compromised vendor, but it takes so little effort to learn and use, why not avail yourself of the slight extra protection it affords?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case, since you are relying so heavily on the discretion of a vendor in disposing properly of your address, a vendor who is so scornful about PGP is a big red flag. Whatever other security and encryption measures are in place, using PGP ensures that only the intended recipient can read your address. Given that the real world address is definitely the weak link in the whole SR process, anything that adds, however slightly, to its security is vital. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t bother replying as I&#039;ve got my hands over my ears going &quot;LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA!&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				2048 bit PGP keys will be resistant to brute force attacks for a few decades, so the only sense in which PGP is &quot;false&quot; security is that you would turn over your clients&#039; info when you got a knock on the door. Thanks for the heads up, at least.
