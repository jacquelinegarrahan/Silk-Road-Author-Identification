				New to this whole process but definitely want to try it out...<br />My only concern is the mailing process to the US...Do I have anything to worry about?&nbsp; <br />They can&#039;t legally open my mail correct?&nbsp; If it were to get seized, don&#039;t I have the option to either go into the mail office and open it in front of them or they just throw it away?<br />Looking for some closure here...Thanks

				The belief here is that as long as your vendor of choice is mailing via USPS then they would effectively need a warrant to open your mail.<br /><br />I say belief because while I do personally believe it to be true, I have never actually heard this from a credible source. (USPS)

				ok, either way since its all anonymous..couldn&#039;t I deny all allegations anyway if anything went wrong?&nbsp; (I&#039;m not that worried that anything will go wrong but I just want to make sure)

				just buy from a trusted vendor with good shipping/packaging(check on forums 4 that), and you probably will never get a domestic pack intercepted.<br /><br />in the case you do you can&#039;t get in trouble unless they kick down your door and found shit in your house. This could happen so to be safe, never have drugs in the house you ship to

				Im looking to buy a very small amount of something...would they really waste their time warranting me for .2g of dmt?<br />I know back in the day, a buddy of mine bought steroids online and his package was intercepted...he said they sent him a letter saying he can pick up the package at the post office or it would be thrown away..Is that kinda routine still in effect?

Now it is fact. Right off the federal site, allow me to quote:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. Can Postal Inspectors open mail if they feel it may contain something illegal?<br />First-Class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant. If there is probable cause to believe the contents of a First-Class letter or parcel violate federal law, Postal Inspectors can obtain a search warrant to open the mailpiece. Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />the next question becomes..what is NOT First-class letters and parcels. Bulk mail? Or is any &quot;business mail&quot; considered to not &quot;private correspondence&quot;. If so this raises a NEW question.<br /><br />If a vendor is masquerading the postal system as a business. Mailing weed with a return address of &quot;Global Herbal Supply International&quot; Does this IMPLY that the package does not contain &quot;private correspondence&quot;? or is the classification only judged via the shipping method chosen with in the USPS system. <br />I.E. - First class, Priority or Express Vs. Bulk fixed postage mailings<br /><br />Real question. the answer could change the game for a lot of people.
