				Hey,<br /><br />I just wanted to voice my minor concern regarding Silk Road&#039;s login CAPTCHA. <br /><br />While my intention is to be as constructive as possible, I must be frank: Silk Road&#039;s CAPTCHA is absolute garbage.&nbsp; It may use dictionary words or look somewhat nice, but it fails to succeed with respect to any CAPTCHA&#039;s main objective, that is, to distinguish humans from bots.&nbsp; <br /><br />Though I haven&#039;t cracked it as there&#039;s no exigency for me to do so, I&#039;m sure I could crack it within an hour or two.&nbsp; It&#039;d be very easy to separate the characters; as I recall, they&#039;re evenly spaced.&nbsp; They are not warped.&nbsp; They are easy to isolate from the background.&nbsp; The list goes on.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons why a solver could be troubling to SR and its community.&nbsp; First and foremost, if it&#039;s easily solvable even by novice programmers, then it&#039;s nothing more than a waste of human time.&nbsp; That is, it fails to prevent bots, but still wastes human time.&nbsp; Second, a solver could be a nuisance or worse to SR and its members.&nbsp; For instance, somebody could write a script to register many many accounts.&nbsp; This makes the site slower, wastes server space, and leaves the door open to further problems.&nbsp; What if somebody wrote a script to spam users?&nbsp; How would 100 spam messages a day feel?&nbsp; Worse yet, if security vulnerabilities were to be discovered somewhere on the site, they could be perpetrated throughout the site rapidly.<br /><br />I don&#039;t intend to scare anyone, I just figured I&#039;d get my point across.&nbsp; As a disclaimer, I am not paranoid, nor am I intoxicated at the time of writing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best,<br />DP<br /><br /><br />

				Never gave this much thought...&nbsp; I was just happy that the CAPTCHA was easy to read! ;)

				Captchas in general are garbage, and there are actually very few of them which cannot be cracked by programmers of reasonable skill using various image processing libraries.&nbsp; The only one I know of that seems fairly crack-proof is the RECAPTCHA service [not like SR is going to sign up for such a thing] - some of those are even hard for me to do unless I get right up close to the screen and squint a little in order to try to figure out if what I&#039;m seeing is an &quot;a&quot; or an &quot;o&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />As to whether or not a captcha-solver bot could be troubling for SR.... Your first point about the captcha being a waste of human time is sort of meaningless.&nbsp; Do an extra few seconds really matter to you that much?&nbsp; If so, then you probably shouldn&#039;t be using Tor hidden services to begin with.&nbsp; Could a bot register lots of accounts?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But think about your own account and the kind of information contained in it.&nbsp; How much space do you think that really takes up?&nbsp; Think about the latency and the overhead involved in each connection to a Tor hidden service.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the same as scraping a bunch of data from a clearnet website, where you can just pound the fuck out of the target with every ounce of bandwidth you have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Could a bot spam users?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But that&#039;s already possible, and it would remain possible even in the presence of a much more difficult captcha unless a captcha were required every time you wanted to send a message.&nbsp; As it is, though, all you&#039;d have to do is manually perform the login step, and then let the bot take over from there.<br /><br />All of this assumes that there aren&#039;t any other hidden security features behind the scenes that watch out for this kind of bad behavior.&nbsp; Maybe there are, maybe there aren&#039;t.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about the SR server and what is or isn&#039;t running on it.&nbsp; That said - could the captcha be &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more secure&quot;?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But in the grand scheme of things, there are probably more important things to worry about.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m just in an argumentative mood today.&nbsp; You could tell me that the sun is shining and I&#039;d find a way to tell you that it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; :-)

				Many of your points are well taken.&nbsp; Of course, it is only a minor issue, as I stated in my first post. I don&#039;t mind spending a few seconds entering in the text.&nbsp; I just wonder why it&#039;s there at all if it&#039;s so half-assed.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think it&#039;d take more than a few minutes to improve it at least to the point where it&#039;d be a considerable project to solve it rather than something that can be done in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually very easy to drastically improve CAPTCHAs.&nbsp; As with any CAPTCHA, of course some clever programmers can solve an improved version, but I posit that fewer would attempt to solve an inherently better CAPTCHA. <br />

				I&#039;ve always have been wondering how safe the captions&nbsp; were on silkroad.i&#039;ve never seen a caption use words before but my theory is maybe tor is a bit slow for a full on brute force attack but i&#039;m probably wrong
