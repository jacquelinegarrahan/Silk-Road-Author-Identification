				Title: <strong>Australian LE Report on BC/SR</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Winters86</strong> on <strong>August 26, 2012, 01:11 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello all,<br />I come from a family of LEO&#039;s, Not just uniformed officers, but upper echelon personnel in multiple agencies both state and federal. I can&#039;t be more specific than that unfortunately. Recently, I gained access to an internal confidential report distributed to several Australia LE agencies and a few international anti-narcotic bodies regarding possible methods of combating illegal activities involving BC. Of course SR was a main feature of said report.<br /><br />I was told not to share any of the information, however I feel this report should be made available to the SR community because it contained methods through which LEO intend to begin to infiltrate and if possible start serious interdiction of the quote &#039;blatant and continually growing narcotic trade SR supports&#039;. Now I can&#039;t post the report openly for everyone, because It could lead to serious consequences for myself and members of my family, I will however share the relevant points made and share an altered version of the report with a few members of the community whom I have already discussed this with and who have agreed to help get the information out there, because I know this one post won&#039;t be enough.<br /><br />So here are the nuts and bolts of the report, spread the information as far and wide as possible friends: <br /><br />1.PGP is terrifying them, every new user who learns it and helps others learn, closes a possible loophole they where planning to exploit. <br />2. User ignorance of the technology being used (Tor, PGP etc) is the their single best hope for any kind of serious action against the SR community. <br />3. Narcotic trade historically involves exploitation and violence. Users working together as a community for a greater good and towards the same goals has made all previous interdiction training basically obsolete. In other words, every user who helps newcomers learn how to be safe and secure especially through the use of PGP for all transactions and communication is a nail in LEO&#039;s coffin.&nbsp; <br />4. A total lack of violence and exploitation is very much working in our favor. So in other words, the idea of a community working together to protect the new and vulnerable has been identified as a huge obstacle for any kind of serious attempt to stop SR.<br />5. Their morale regarding fighting SR and BC is very low at the moment, mainly because very few LEO have the capacity to comprehend how the whole system works, but unfortunately, recent media coverage demands some kind of action, so they are going to have to show the public they are doing SOMETHING to combat SR, they just aren&#039;t sure what yet.<br /><br />So there you have it my friends, Think of it like we are involved in an Insurrection and they are trying to pacify our homeland. History dictates that a determined and unified local populace will always defeat an invading enemy, regardless of strength through slowly sapping that enemies very will to continue the fight. We have the upper hand, there are just a few things we need to do to win the war and if you have read this post, you will see what those things are.<br /><br />Go forth and educate yourself and anyone who needs it. Lean PGP, use it, teach others, encourage the spirit of community and helping others and victory shall be ours.<br />Be safe and smart friends.<br />

				+1 Good to see some insight from the inner workings of LE. They posted the FBI intel report as well which pretty much says that the Bitcoin is strong and scary because they don&#039;t know exactly how to trace it and when you was the coins it becomes almost impossible. There are rumors that the NSA has a computer that is capable of cracking PGP but it&#039;s just a rumor and I honestly doubt they would waste it on us. <br /><br />The best thing noobies to SR can do is just read, read, and read some more. That&#039;s what I did when I joined a year ago, I went through almost every thread! Granted it was mumbo jumbo at first but through trial and error you get the hang of it&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				Glad to see so many people have read this :), I have been made aware that a new, more detailed report on BC/SR is due to be distributed among Australian LE sometime soon, I will strive to post as much information about it as possible if I get the opportunity to read it, In the mean time, I am going to attempt to digitize and distribute the first report to a few members of the community who have kindly offered their assistance in spreading the information, Until then, be safe everyone and keep and eye on the forums. I will continue to post relevant counter-Intel as I get it, thankfully the LEO&#039;s in my family are concerned with combating real crimes on the darknet, mainly CEM (Child Exploitation Material) They actually believe that drugs should be legalized and have no problem with SR (especially now the armory is closed, that was a smart move.), This is why they share information about BC/SR with me freely. If only more LEO had the same mindset... <br />

				Hummmm..... you know... I&#039;ve been doing some reading and it seems more possible that LE will fight to shut down BC&#039;s, not SR and try to cut off the flow of money...<br /><br />I think the main focus LE has is the idea that money laundering and funding terrorism will grow out of control and that they will have no real way of tracing anything. There much more interested in the mafia or the cartels using btc to move money and create wars in the street and terrorists to use it to fund training and attacks then the little guys moving some drugs... ALTHOUGH...I would NEVER EVER EVER sell anything hard on any site anywhere on the darknet or clearnet myself. (no hate for those who do)<br /><br />LE has issues with Coke, H, MDMA, Prescriptions, LSD pretty much all hard drugs.. to be honest I&#039;d love if this site split up to and opened a new site just for green.. LE has too much on there plate to go after some green.. but kids being able to buy H&nbsp; online ship it to there &quot;older friends apt&quot; and smoke it like they see in a movie.. well now tha&#039;st pushing it a bit too far... God forbid&nbsp; that kid OD&#039;s and dies...<br /><br />I&#039;d rather be part of a 420 only community then one rapped up with all the hard drugs, plus I&#039;ma big hippie at heart!<br /><br />All in all.. only time will tell what will happen here... but its laying the ground work for big changes to come and that can only be a good thing!<br />

				Matrix: According to SR the mailing information is never stored on their servers. And TOR is encrypted. So as long as TOR and SR are trustworthy, I have nothing to worry about. If SR were untrustworthy it&#039;s more likely they&#039;d just steal all our money.<br />There have been a couple times where I&#039;ve messaged a vendor my address in plain text due to re-shipping, and then instructed them to delete the message immediately.

I&#039;ve been arguing&nbsp; this for some time now. I would even go so far as to say that some of the BTC thefts may have been designed so as to shut-down the smaller exchanges, likely the ones with lax (or non-existent) AML controls. The idea would be to force everyone though controlled and/or LEA-friendly channels (like Mt. Gox). <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Even if we all end up being forced to use tracked exchanges, like Mt. Gox, using mixers and tumblers can make tying a specific suspect transaction or BTC address to a particular person is difficult.<br /><br />Take the address in my signature, for example, it&#039;s received something like 3 payments.&nbsp; Of those 2 went to other people/entities and the larger one went through a mixer to its final destination.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.msg458261#msg458261">Quote from: Guru on September 10, 2012, 06:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think it&#039;s more the idea that they&#039;re trying to shut down an experiment. If the authorities are unable to shut down SR, or control alternative means of exchange (like BTCs) then they&#039;re afraid that this meme will spread. I suspect they liken it to an early-stage cancer -- better to nuke/excise it when it&#039;s only a few cells... they don&#039;t want to wait until it spreads. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you&#039;re probably right there.<br /><br />As for the concern about Bitcoin being used for money laundering or funding terrorism, the entire market cap of the Bitcoin economy (of which 80-90% is probably &quot;legitimate&quot; trading, mainly currency trading) isn&#039;t large enough to be a major concern (yet).<br />

I lived through the crypto wars -- take it from me -- the police were literally apoplectic at the prospect of unescrowed encryption, i.e. PGP. <br /><br />The heads of the various police agencies were literally going around screaming, &quot;The sky is falling!&quot; to anyone who would listen. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, they were.&nbsp; Key escrow was a particularly nasty idea, but was doomed to failure because it depended on people willingly handing over a copy of their secret keys to law enforcement or registering their use of PGP.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.msg458274#msg458274">Quote from: Guru on September 10, 2012, 06:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Check out Stephen Levy&#039;s book: Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government, Saving Privacy in the Digital Age -- it&#039;s a good history of those times. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Another good one for some background, but with less detail is The Code Book by Simon Singh.<br />

As it stands, I can find multiple references to 100% of incoming mail to Australia being screened. I have read one report that claimed 100% of non-letter mail is screened, and that is how people manage to get letters through, it is still screened but not 100%. <br />

				I wouldn&#039;t be so sure that they will only go after big time importers, I knew someone in Aus many years back on a private forum who got raided by feds with guns drawn at dawn and they had intercepted something like half a sheet of acid a few grams of k and some mdma (can&#039;t remember exact order details). He only ended up getting probation, although he was likely sent to prison shortly after as another vendor sent a package to him after that ordeal and we never heard from him again (plus it was only the first part of a two pack shipment and he never claimed he got the first pack or made any new posts so).

				I suspect both moksha and kmfkewm are correct, depending on your definition of what &#039;inspection&#039; means in practice. I suspect their 100% claim actually weakens their ability to intercept more parcels, since it is a normative metric and not a dynamic one. e.g. political pressure to make a precursory sweep if you can&#039;t inspect the last 5% properly.<br /><br />Whether customs are more or less adept at interception depends a great deal on geographical circumstances so far as I can see. It&#039;s easier to look smart when the terrain is in your favor, and that confidence may then increase proficiency elsewhere. But take away the geographical advantage, and they lose the war entirely. In fact I think this will happen, since I think swarming is something that will come to the postal services of most countries eventually (small autonomous aircraft like drones taking parcels from A to B, both within countries and across great distances).

				Still is a huge difference between 100% of mail having some screening technique applied to it, regardless of how effective, and less than 100% of mail being screened (or whatever it is in USA I am not sure) with only 100% of mail from certain high risk countries being screened with some technique, regardless of how effective.

				Alright, I&#039;ll consider using PGP in future.<br />My orders have been delivered to Aus fairly successfully. My experience is to not use a fake name. Only a couple packages arrive before &quot;something&quot; happens, but seizure letters never arrive. Makes me think working as a customs officer would be a nice job! ;)<br />Working on that light sensitive RFID chip idea would be fun; if only I had the time!

Customs/Borders Authorities have no motivation to claim that they screen anything less than 100% of international post, particularly given the current situation with regard to fake terror threats. <br /><br />I suggest you think carefully about what you are trying to achieve before you try to make a point so vociferously. As there are no doubt some nervous Australians 1st time buyers who may think twice unnecessarily on the basis of what you&#039;ve said. Not what you&#039;d want, surely?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, it is what I want. Australia indeed has tough as shit customs, indeed they screen 100% of incoming international mail (as I have proven with multiple citations from multiple sources including internal government agency assessment documents that were never intended for drug smugglers to look at), and if people in Australia start to only import letter sized packages due to my pointing this out to them, then there are going to be far fewer busts and interceptions of international packages going to Australians.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think most Australians would much rather know that their customs screen 100% of incoming mail and that getting large shipments through is extraordinarily harder for them to do than it is for people in countries like U.S.A., than they would like to hear a bunch of feel good bullshit and non cited claims to the contrary. See a naive user here may not know that their countries customs is more difficult than the customs of most other people ordering drugs here, and it is good to let them know that before they try to import a kilo of ketamine (safe enough in USA) and get ass raped (very risky in Australia). Why do you think internationally sourced drugs cost five times more in Australia than they do in other countries? Ask anyone in the mail order drug game for several years which country has the most notorious customs and tell me what their answer is. Ask any vendors who have shipped to many countries for long periods of time which countries they have had the most interceptions to.

Of the 54 million air freight parcels received through the postal system, only 21 million are X-rayed.<br /><br />Customs says these odds are not as tempting as they might look to criminals, because 100 per cent of cargo and freight is risk-assessed, and high-risk shipments identified during this process are subject to inspection.&quot;

				OTC is the answer. A decentralized network of exchangers big and small with different types of tertiary market services. Right now it may seem inconvenient, but with enough infrastructure it&#039;ll be even easier than the current system, albeit the spreads are likely to be higher, but the anonymity property drastically higher, making less important the concept of disguising traffic on the blockchain.<br /><br />localbitcoin, bitcoin-otc, tradebitcoin are just a few clearnet examples. I expect to see hidden services offering the same functions when those clearnet sites are attacked.<br /><br />This will be part of a greater evolution, where vendors find it much better turnaround time on restocking inventory because they can go to a huge set of entities for exchange, using a thousand different methods. Don&#039;t think 1 solution, think an entire kaleidoscope of them.<br /><br />Unless of course, there aren&#039;t millions of poorly paid, intelligent well educated young people out there willing to work for decent money without tax and nearly zero risk of getting caught.<br /><br />So you see it all comes together, sooner or later. We are at the *perfect* spot in the economic cycle.<br /><br />I am not suggesting we be passive observers. No Sir! I&#039;m saying this is mother fucking Gold Rush time. We are going to construct the bridges, canals and roads for this new Industrial Revolution on the Black Markets, using 21st century technologies. In the future our financial markets will have the equivalent of vast container ships moving product, currency and information, for today we are small but tomorrow we will rule the coming century. The Black Market is simply exploding in size, all over the world in every sector, SR is simply a drop in the ocean and we represent the first group of people to realize the practical application of cryptocurrencies for placing a financial foundation underneath it. According to economists, although developed GDP growth has slowed down in the last 50 years, the black markets have accelerated, becoming once more the true face of &quot;actual existing&quot; capitalism.<br /><br />Today&#039;s vendors and market participants will be tomorrow&#039;s Rockefellers and Rothschilds. You just have to grab a shovel and slam it, this is our country and there&#039;s gold in &#039;em hills.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to believe it, but I do and I&#039;m going to make it happen by the whatever means necessary.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if Bitcoin itself fails. It doesn&#039;t matter if SR fails. Only the Network matters. The supply and demand. That is what drives all this technological progress, little else. If a roadblock is dropped in our way, we&#039;ll build bypasses and fairly squiggly roads. It&#039;s not a matter of &quot;belief&quot;, it&#039;s a practical matter of making money and recognizing arbitrage points.

But that&#039;s ok, it is a stepping stone, an intermediary. It&#039;s funny that some bitcoin proponents think that we&#039;re some kind of parasite on bitcoin, when in fact it&#039;s basically the other way around. SR is like a country. Bitcoin people who think that because SR is 1/3 - 1/2 of the market of bitcoin or so, it&#039;s not the main picture, are completely bonkers. This is why:<br /><br />When I said SR is like a country, I wasn&#039;t using a metaphor. Let&#039;s say we have two countries. Americastan and Silkroadistan. Products in Silkroadistan are priced in bitcoins. Products in Americastan are priced in dollars. When you want products from Americastan, you must sell bitcoins and acquire dollars, then you visit Americanstan and return with Americastan products. Similarly, in order to obtain products from Silkroadistan, you doing the exact same process in reverse.<br /><br />It&#039;s simply amazing how many people on the bitcoin forums do not comprehend this simple piece of economic logic. They say that &quot;exchanges and currency trading&quot; is the mainstay of the bitcoin economy currently, not the Silk Road. I fell over laughing when I heard that, but nobody seemed to get it.<br /><br />Nooooooooooo. Not correct. The reason why those &#039;sectors&#039; exist in the first place, is because travellers to Silkroadistan require currency to acquire product in Silkroadistan. Their accounting is badly wrong.<br /><br />Thus, the currency trading done and the darknet markets are one and the same thing, just two sides of the same coin. The bitcoin advocates against SR are simply double counting. Actually almost the entire bitcoin economy is powered by the darknet markets. Not unless they literally mean that the trading fees from MtGox and Intersango are over 20 million dollars in income, which they are definitely not. 1 BTC bought on an exchange is 1 BTC used to buy drugs (or nice socks). Currencies are only worth their use value.<br /><br />&quot;Speculation&quot; is another thing they fall back to. This doesn&#039;t add up either. Speculation is by definition a zero sum game. Gambling in such a way doesn&#039;t put any value into the bitcoin economy, it merely provides temporary liquidity. This is important property, but it doesn&#039;t materially change prices over any reasonable time frame and so it doesn&#039;t make sense to quote it as a sector. Similarly, real gambling e.g. bitcoin for poker games doesn&#039;t add value to the economy either. At no point is further value generated back into the bitcoin economy. Currencies are exchanged, but new value, actual products and services are not generated. An easy way to see this, is to visualize yourself on a desert island. If you use coconuts as a medium of exchange with your fellow ship wrecked friends, you&#039;ll quickly note that exchanging coconuts, at any kind of speed, does not change the economic value of the coconuts. The value of the coconuts remains static, but the prices continually changes, following the typical boom and bust process. Ultimately, if you average out the value of the coconuts over different (long) periods of time, you find that you reach an average that is almost exactly the same every time. This is because actual goods and services, real things, are what actually underpins the value of a currency, despite all appearances to the contrary. I know that bitcoin is mildly inflationary, but you see my point. Bitcoin is used to buy alpaca socks and drugs in the physical realm, and but for that it&#039;s just a bunch of geeks trading a sophisticated version of World of Warcraft game gold pieces back and forth. The exchanges themselves do actually add value to the economy, not the net transactions they facilitate, but the service of making transactions. This however, is not really that much value. Witness the size of the stock exchanges. The stock exchanges themselves are huge. The stock exchange, that is; the company offering the stock exchange service, is really really tiny, manned by a dozen staff or so in most cases.<br /><br />LE, not having the rose tinted glasses so much, likely grasp this instinctively even if they don&#039;t hire an economist to work it out, which is why the exchanges are going to be raided and shut down. That is simply inevitable. I think they would try to hit SR first, and then the bitcoin exchanges later, which is the only reason why it hasn&#039;t yet occurred.<br /><br />At some point naive bitcoin people and we shall part company. They will likely go into a tailspin like every other e-commence currency. I mean, I hope they don&#039;t, honestly. But any concessions to the State in the form of identification or registration is the regulatory death knell for an e-commerce solution trying to compete against the financial established order. They are up against MASSIVE corrupt banking corporations and officials making backroom deals. They haven&#039;t a hope in hell. They need us, but not all of them know it. SR is an extremely practical identification of a market requirement that already had a high threshold imposed via regulations i.e. that the product was illegal and therefore by definition regulated out of white market existence. So, looking at it this way, you see SR has less hurdles &quot;paperwork&quot;, if you want to call it that, in obtaining product for many people.<br /><br />Eventually however, the darknet markets will actually provide *cheaper* access to drugs. This is an outcome not many people get, not even on SR. But it too is inevitable. One simple reason among many, is that the entire apparatus of distributing drugs normally, this big hierarchy of gangs, is hugely expensive for the Mafia and other entities to maintain. The majority of players get pittance in fact, but there are so many of them that it&#039;s something (off the top of my head) like 20% - 40% of the cost of the drugs themselves. The second reason is horizontal and vertical integration is economic and highly profitable for a huge number of new market participants. Look those up on youtube or wikipedia or some place if you haven&#039;t heard of those ideas before. Basically it is now possible for a tiny team of even 3 or 5 person operation (making synthetics or doing grow-ops) to provide the same level of output as an entire traditional black market corporation with hundreds or thousands of workers. And there are others too.<br /><br />Black market just turned Industrial. It&#039;s just that not everybody&#039;s caught up yet. In the future, all this will seem stupidly obvious to anybody on the street.<br /><br />

Granted most of them were concerned with stealing credit card information and hacking into bank accounts though. There are a lot of safe ways to handle financial transactions though. There must be a dozen different E-currency providers in a dozen different countries that don&#039;t require identification documents to get accounts with. Pretty much any electronic currency can be mixed. So some places are making it hard to get Bitcoins, but really it is not that hard. You can still send money via WU or bank wire to any of the several dozen different traditional E-currency exchangers, cash it out to liberty reserve or pecunix and then buy bitcoins from an exchanger that takes those forms of payment.

				So in reference to the question about all international post being screened...<br /><br />All post that will be on an airplane at some point will go through an x-ray as explosives are organic and no one wants that on their plane. So even if it is not scanned at the receiving end it will be scanned at the sending end. All mail coming into Australia gets put through an x-ray before customs releases it. Even if you don&#039;t believe that you should at least be prepared as such. <br /><br />The best way to avoid detection is to try and blend into the surroundings. Imagine a conveyor belt with a huge screen and a team working 24/7 to scan all the items. They can still only report on what they see with their eyes. You want to try and blend into the other organic material (colour orange) also passing through (hint: paper and clothes are organic).<br /><br />Therefore if you are sending powder, make sure it is packed down as thinly as possible. This will be less likely to be pulled out of the flow for observation. From this I would consider powder safer to be sent than pills. Think about how the latter would show up on an x-ray.<br /><br />Also, if customs finds something they have no choice but to pass it into the AFP. The AFP officer can then decide whether it is worth the trouble of chasing up.<br /><br />Of course all of this is hearsay and and third hand information (as everything else on this forum is) but it seems logical to me.

				BC you can be assured that anything going on an airplane will be x-rayed for organic (explosive) material. That includes domestic flights (your express post from Sydney to Perth) or international mail (Amsterdam to Darwin). <br /><br />Whether or not it all gets scanned at the receiving end is up for debate.<br /><br />Either way - prepare your packages to beat xrays.

Or actually open the tubs (ie: whey/protein powder) etc ?<br /><br />Wonder if OP is still around... Would be good to get some more inside info.

I will continue to post relevant counter-Intel as I get it, thankfully the LEO&#039;s in my family are concerned with combating real crimes on the darknet, mainly CEM (Child Exploitation Material) They actually believe that drugs should be legalized and have no problem with SR (especially now the armory is closed, that was a smart move.), This is why they share information about BC/SR with me freely. If only more LEO had the same mindset...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really appreciate everything you have shared here.. it was informative and inspirational. It all seems a little too convenient, though. It&#039;s exactly what a lot of people would want to hear. This worries me. I always look at things from an objective point of view, both sides of the coin, if you will. Don&#039;t take that the wrong way. The downfall of anonymity is you can trust everyone and no one at the same time.<br /><br />Perhaps this will make me into a successful patron of the SR.<br />
