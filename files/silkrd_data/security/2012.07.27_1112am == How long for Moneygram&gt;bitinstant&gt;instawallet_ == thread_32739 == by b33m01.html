				Hi,<br />I tried to use Moneygram last night to send myself some BTC.<br />Went to bitinstant, set it up, took my ZipZap payment paper to Wal-Mart and filled out the form and sent it. I got a ZipZap confirmation email so I know that worked, but there are no coins in the wallet address I put on the form, and BlockChain shows no transactions associated with that address. Now, I did this at 10pm EST, and it&#039;s not only 7AM EST, could that be the reason why it hasn&#039;t shown up yet?<br /><br />Thanks for any help

				Is that instawallet.org? It can take some time, just make sure you got the address right,<br /><br />And were you planning on sending from there to your SR address?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don&#039;t, use bitcoinfog as an intermedialry. You&#039;ll get truly mixed and untraceable coins into yur SR account.<br /><br />goblin

				SR hides the outgoing bitcoin transactions, not the incoming ones. And if there&#039;s a purchase, and coins are in escrow, you might say that it&#039;s mixed there, but not before, nor after. Before, you have a path that leads from an online wallet to your SR address (not hidden), and after, if you&#039;re a seller, the newly-acquired coins that now sit in your account, are hidden (mixed) when they are withdrawn to wherever it is you send them to cash out. But even then, it&#039;s wise to use a mixing service to completely obliterate any traceable path that may lead to you.<br /><br />goblin

				I have used bitinstant before and my transactions were always completed very quickly, like in under an hour or so.&nbsp; Also The other day I had an issue with a transaction where I was cashing out to a paypal account.&nbsp; I received email support form them from 2am to 4am in the morning and they fixed the issues for me. I was pretty happy with the customer support. You should just hit them up and see what they have to say about it.
