				I agree with Guru here and will add<br /><br />RUN AWAY!<br /><br />I would not touch a vendor that requested privnote with a 100 meter cattle prod.<br /><br />But that is just me.

				Personally, i do like privnote, but not for exchanging addresses to vendors, but more so of asking Questions or things that i wouldnt want to see saved in any inbox or anything like that. <br /><br />@.@ Still need to set up my pgp, been putting it off for so long now.

However, a vendor who either cannot -- or worse yet&nbsp; -- will not -- use PGP is another thing altogether.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t do business with such a vendor, regardless of what he is selling or at what price. It only stands to reason that a vendor is more of a target for the authorities than a customer. If a vendor does not make the fullest use of the best tools available to protect both himself and his customers, then I have to call his competency into question. <br /><br />Ask yourself, do you really want to deal with a vendor who is either too lazy (or too incompetent) to use the best tools to protect _your_ information? <br />If you do business with this guy, that&#039;s exactly what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; Personally, I wouldn&#039;t touch him with a barge-pole. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I disagree entirely. It is almost entirely the customers risk if GPG is not used. Vendors are barely more vulnerable if they use GPG or not provided they take all the other required counter measures. So I think customers who do not use GPG can not be cut slack, since using GPG is almost entirely to their advantage.

Thus being a LARGE risk for the dealer.

				If you search the forums that dude kmefkwm goes on a hilariously enlightening and informative tyrade against the use of privnot. He convinced me to never use it again.<br /><br />Ill find the link here soon and post it.<br /><br />There are decent vendors who may not have figured out pgp right away when they started, but I agree with the other posters, go with a vendor who offers a pgp key.
