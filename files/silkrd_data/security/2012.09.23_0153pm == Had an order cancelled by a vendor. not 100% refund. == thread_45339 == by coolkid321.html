				I had an order cancelled by a vendor. I paid 921.17 at $12.22 per bitcoin. so thats 75.36 bitcoins. SOOOOO as I said the order was cancelled but I only recieved 72.46 bitcoin back. The price of bitcoin has dropped a bit since last night. but how in the hell do I LOSE 2.9 bitcoin?? BTW the order NEVER shipped.<br /><br />also I remember reading somewhere that if I get a refund it should be the value of what I paid no matter the price of bitcoin. so if spend 2 bitcoin that are worth 10 a piece and by the time I get my refund they are only worth 5 bucks then I should get 4 bitcoin. someone correct me if im wrong.<br /><br />PS the vendor is well known on here so if im being cheated and he makes it right then I wont out his name.

				The refund rate varies unless you choose the hedge option ( that there is a fee) from what I have read so far. try searching for hedge and it should give you a load of info

				The vendor didn&#039;t have the coins yet so it&#039;s not the vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Silk Road fee.&nbsp; Just to be clear i feel certain the vendor didn&#039;t keep your coins.&nbsp; SR did.&nbsp; They get their fee or a portion of it regardless of the cancellation.

				BTW Coolkid.&nbsp; I did an order with CaliforniaBuddy a few weeks ago and he is top notch.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dealing with him then it&#039;s going to be a top notch transaction!&nbsp; I would wish you good luck, but you don&#039;t need it.
