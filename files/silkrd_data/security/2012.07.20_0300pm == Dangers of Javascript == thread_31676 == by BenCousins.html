				So sometimes i have to briefly turn javascript on to view things in TOR (privnote etc) and forget to turn it off, I see alot of javascript paranoia around here so im wandering what are the dangers of this? <br /><br />Also what are the dangers of using both the clearnet and TOR at the same time?<br /><br />BC

				A lot of the simpler anonymity issues with javascript are protected from by TorButton. The remaining concern about javascript is that it can be used by an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in your browser. Not having javascript enabled makes it harder for hackers to pwn you through your browser.

The width of a human thigh is quite thick and would normally make it difficult to tell an age characteristic on a image so tiny, but the width of the woman&#039;s leg on top gives a clear frame of reference because is 3 times larger than the girl below her. At the very most it is a girl in her early teens with a small frame and an especially larger older woman, but it is even more likely that it is preadolescence child porn.<br /><br />Delete your avatar and ideally, leave the site entirely, SR&#039;s reputation is not to be sullied by accusations of hosting child porn.

				If JS was turned on, you could do a lot more than expose an IP. The dangers come of using JS/Flash to install any type of malware, which could search for .dat and steal bitcoins. Javascript is the #1 way computers are infected by viruses. I have written several flash/js based cross site scripting worms. Something like that all across tor, where people notoriously have bitcoin wallets or log in to SR/mtgox would be highly insecure. You&#039;d be opening up a market of people who largely have some untraceable money somewhere.

				pine i agree with everything you said about privnote and beleive me i dont use it but plenty of people do. I actually spend most my time sober (depression, anxiety makes the come downs from most things including alcohol just not worth it) so i dont actually order from here that much but when i do i use PGP but someone i know IRL is a vendor (aus vendor) and we were speaking about it and he was mentioning how many people who order form him send a privnote and he has to use javascript to view it so we were wondering what the exact danger is? now if he only uses his java script for privnote and tracking sites (official post ones) and TOR for SR mostly is there any real danger.<br /><br />Also I comend your&nbsp; PGP club but ive got the basics for the rare instances i use it down pat, but are you teaching any more advanced stuff to do with PGP/anonymity etc?<br /><br />sincerly<br />Ben<br /><br />P.S. No blackhelicopters down here we buy them but we cant seem to work out how they can fly<br /><br />P.P.S I DO NOT USE FUCKING PRIVNOTE

That&#039;s assuming that privnote is in fact an actual business and not simply just a front for a LEO, which I think it most likely is given that as kmf was saying everybody is suddenly all &quot;fuck yeah, privnote&quot; out of nowhere on here and other drug related forums.<br /><br />It is also not a good idea to use post tracking sites for locating packages in the mail system.

On that subject, many of us believe, including myself, that the postage tracking services of the world have a list of public Tor nodes which they check against any query.
