				I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to post this and if it is not could someone direct me were to post deals gone bad.<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR and have been trying to get some bit coins so I could start up as a seller ( I&#039;m from Canada and finding it VERY HARD to get then).<br /><br />I posted I had some D8&#039;s (Hydromorphone 8&#039;s to trade for bit coins. I received several inquiries and decided to deal with a SR member named A( I now assume the A stood for Asshole ) as he is also from Canada. He deposited 3 bit coins to prove he had access to them. I then shipped him the amount of pills we had agreed upon. Once he received them he was to put the rest of the bit coins that he owed me into my SR account ( so I could start up as a seller on SR ). On Oct. 03 at 10:56 AM the package was delivered. since Oct 01 I have not received any responses to the several messages I have sent him. I know he&#039;s been on SR every day for the last 5 or 6 day ( I checked his profile it tells you last time on line ).&nbsp; Not only did I loose the pill it also cost me over $30 to have it sent to him overnight (at his request ).<br /><br />Does anyone have ANY SUGGESTIONS on how to not get burnt in the future?<br /><br />Also if A wants you to ship first on any deals he won&#039;t pay so don&#039;t ( I know he&#039;ll just sign up as a new member with a different name and try and find another sucker like me.<br /><br />Candyman626

				If you&#039;re from Canada then you could try out a Canadian service https://www.cavirtex.com. They accept direct bank account deposits so as long as you have a canadian bank account you&#039;re good to go. And remember that buying bitcoins is completely legal. Just because you may have a less than legal intention for them doesn&#039;t mean anybody knows the difference.<br /><br />As for not getting burned in the future it would be to get bitcoins from cavirtex, then buy a seller&#039;s account and *never* go out of escrow. <br /><br />Sorry to hear that you got ripped off, it sucks hardcore. :/

				somehow this sounds familiar .-)<br />altho i did not get burned, i started<br />in a somewhat same situation.<br /><br />I offerd some cheap test samples to the community,<br />1b for some 3-4 trips.<br />around 16 ppl responded/pm&#039;d to the offer,<br />from those 16 around 11 where from obious<br />fresh made accounts&nbsp; :o :-\( i suspected randoms looking for a easy scam).<br />These Folks never responded to pm&#039;s from me offering<br />them the Test Pakcage not for &quot;pay afterwards&quot; but for&quot;pay at least 50% upfront&quot;.<br />..wave 1 of scammers seeded out....<br />the remaining 5 where trusted members / new members that responded to pm&#039;s.<br />2 where just corious and wanted to have a talk with me about stuff :_)<br />(nothing wrong with that)<br />3 Where seriously intrested in my product for the stated agreed conditions.<br />- ;D :D ;)<br />... Trust is hard to come by in the interwebs and that includes SR..<br />You have to expect some sort of Fraud/Scam trys when ur new to the community<br />as vendor i guess..<br /><br />I would suggest beeing smart about stuff,<br />develop a good nose for smelling scams,<br />live with some minor setbacks in the beginning/progress of your projects.<br />it&#039;s not worth getting worked up over it.<br />If you cant afford to loose a 30$ overnight shipping + Product to<br />a &quot;random dude from the intwerwebs which is in this awsome<br />drugs selling community&quot; you should not do it :_)<br /><br />karma is a biatch, scammers will get it back soemday somehow ;D ;)<br /><br />my 2 cents.<br /><br />TW

				I get hit up all the time thru pms by people wanting to sell stuff without giving SR their cut.&nbsp; This site was set up to avoid rip-offs, and snitches.&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#039;t designed for us start selling to each other on our own.&nbsp; Not really fair to the site owners either.&nbsp; I figure if I go outside of proxy, and don&#039;t use SR the way it&#039;s setup, then I can&#039;t complain when it goes sour.&nbsp; Take it as a learning experience and play by the rules.&nbsp;
