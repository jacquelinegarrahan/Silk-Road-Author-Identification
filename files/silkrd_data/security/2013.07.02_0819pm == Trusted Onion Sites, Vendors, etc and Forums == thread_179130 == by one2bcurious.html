				I have been browsing through different Tor &amp; Onion directories and there seems to be a lot of cool sites to browse and even some that are merchants.&nbsp; However, there doesnt seem to be a good place for reviews or to find out if they are legit.&nbsp; Does anyone have any links to something like that?<br /><br />Also, all the Onion and Tor based forums seem to be pretty dead.&nbsp; Are there any good ones for general discussion?<br /><br />This may belong somewhere else but since I am looking for secure sites, this seemed best.

				A lot of the independent vendors in onionland are scammers.

				Damn, Evil Wiki is a good one.&nbsp; Havent been there yet.&nbsp; Cleaned Hidden wiki has kind of been my go-to.<br /><br />Are any of the vendors out there reliable?<br /><br />I am not down to do any of the scamming stuff like Paypal accounts, credit cards, etc.&nbsp; I have had my shit hacked before and it sucks.&nbsp; However, I have been looking for somewhere that describes that process because I am really curious as to how people do that and how it is so prevalent.&nbsp; <br /><br />It doesnt really shock me that you can buy substances and weapons but the one thing about all this is those kind of sites.&nbsp; I have to imagine that 90% of them are scams but it seems that some are reliable.&nbsp; I was trying to find a forum that had like a FAQ on that kind of stuff just to quench my curiousity but the forums seem kind of dead for the most part.

				Dude, I know a lot of people in this community and a few others on the darknets (on Tor and I2P), and I don&#039;t know anyone who has purchased from the independent vendors that are listed on the wikis, not the drug vendors, not CC vendors, not computer equipment vendors, not assassins, no one. The few cases I&#039;ve heard about have universally involved scams. Forget about them. Stick to the centralized markets, and obviously 90% of that activity and 90% of those reviews are right here on SR. I&#039;m not shilling for them, it&#039;s just a fact. You won&#039;t get better information about vendors than right here. You stand the lowest chance of being scammed right here.<br /><br />

				Tried going on a couple of private vendor shops, listed on Clear Hidden Wiki, but they wouldn&#039;t load. Been having similar problems with TORDIR. Anyone know why this would happen? The directories themselves load ok, but the links are being blocked or something. Seems to have started after I installed the new TOR browser bundle, but this could be a coincidence. Tried it with my old browser but had the same problem. Nearly all my usual sites are working fine, its just links from those 2 directories.<br />Any assistance gratefully accepted! :)
