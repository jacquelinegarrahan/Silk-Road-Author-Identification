				I don;t know if you noticed, but when you login to mtgox.com your access details including username and password are displayed in the adress bar in PLAIN TEXT!<br />Anyone who has access to your browsing history can now clean your mtgox account.<br />Even the SSL connection doesn;t help, because if someone is sniffing in your network, he will know what URL you visited and he&#039;ll have your login and pass.<br />Fuck them.

				thats why I have a yubi key...worth the 30 bucks or so... (even though I think they should give them for&nbsp; free) the only bone that I have with mt. gox is that you (the customer) has to keep good records of all incoming and outgoing money/bitcoins. They dont seem to be able to catch their own errors.&nbsp; the last month, I would have lost 3k dollars had i not kept good record and let them know that my money never made it to dwolla.<br /><br />I guarantee they collect a lot of money by unsespecting customers. Keep good records and tell them asap when you notice a discrepancy... I dont trust them as far as i can throw them, lol.. So far, they have fixed all their &quot;mistakes&quot;..

They have taken care of the problem each time though. <br /><br />I got offered one of those key things... I didn&#039;t even feel like it was worth my time, even though it was free. What do you think about it?

				yubikeys are fucking solid<br /><br />a virtual USB keyboard that creates long AES one time passwords for secure two factor authentication merely by plugging it in<br />and then it has pretty nice APIs and OATH support and shit making it really easy for a website to add yubikey support (say, mtgox and lastpass)<br /><br />i&#039;m sure good smaller business sysadmins love the heck out of it, great easy way to add multifactor authentication to your openVPN server or anything else<br />i wonder if there are GPG or truecrypt builds with added yubikey support, because if somebody felt like they wanted to i see no reason why it couldn&#039;t be done<br /><br /><br />you can also use it to automatically enter a static gigantic high entropy overkill password for say your fully encrypted laptop drive with client information on it, or your wireless, or anything else really, although this doesn&#039;t really provide any additional security over a quality memorable password, but it can add convenience
