				So I learned today that you could bypass mtgox completely and just transfer bitcoins straight to your bitcoin address. I took a nap, woke up and was talking to a local friend. I told him how we could just skip bypass and transfer straight to our SR bitcoin address. My buddy went to go check and told me there was not an option for that. I go and check and confirm there option to transfer straight to your bitcoin address has been removed. Anyone got any info on why??

				This happens more often than it should. If you notice at the bottom when that option dissappears it will usually say &quot;All Reserves Up&quot;. Meaning that they don&#039;t have any cash on coinapult (exchange that handles straight to BTC) and cannot process your order until they have topped up their reserves. It appears to be back now though, at least for the moment.

				Thanks for the reply I was very impressed with bitinstants communication, they responded to my question in less than a few minutes and told me why it was down. Thanks.
