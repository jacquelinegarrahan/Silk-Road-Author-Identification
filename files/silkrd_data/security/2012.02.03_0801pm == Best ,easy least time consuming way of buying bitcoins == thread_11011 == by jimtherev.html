				If you are prepared to wait over 72 hours then use get-bitcoin.com.&nbsp; I read lots of reviews and most were good; however, my experience has been frustrating so far.&nbsp; Apparently, they are having internet connectivity issues and the excuse before that was someone forgot to place my order.&nbsp; Now, I am patient and I will give them credit for being quick to answer my questions but depositing cash in their account on Tuesday and still not having coins by Friday is not acceptable.&nbsp; Maybe when they aren&#039;t so busy their service and turn times are better.&nbsp; I&#039;ll advise once I get my coins.

				Received my coins this morning along with fee refund.&nbsp; Good communication through the whole process it was just slower than I&#039;d hoped.&nbsp; I will give them another chance though because they are trust worthy.

				Just curious. Isn&#039;t going to one of the many exchanges the cheapest and safest way to get BTC? Why do people look for other options? I would think that the level of anonymity is just about the same, is it not?

As far as the Bitcoin network is concerned, all you do by tumbling on your own, is add one more link to the chain. Not sure how much that helps. But, sure, I do it anyways.
