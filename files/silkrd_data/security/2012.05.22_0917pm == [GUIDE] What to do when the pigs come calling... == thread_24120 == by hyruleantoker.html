			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve seen so many threads and posts in my short time here, regarding how to handle cops, among other things. Most of the time, the word has been to keep your mouth shut, and let the only word you utter be &#039;Lawyer&#039;. This however, seems to only fit some situations.<br />I&#039;m making this post as a sort of guide for that off chance you have an encounter with a pig from LE.<br />I&#039;ll be the first to admit that every situation is unique, and some call for different actions than others, but this should cover some basics. Ultimately, how you behave is up to you.<br /><br />Situation 1: Signing for packages<br />You get a letter in the mail after ordering something from SR. This note tells you that you need to come to the Post Office to sign for a package.<br /><br />What to do: Do not go in! Do not sign for any package. Signing means that you acknowledge ordering whatever is in the package, and you can be held accountable as such.<br />If you get such a letter, you&#039;re out of luck, and you&#039;re best bet is just to lie low for a short while (I would personally suggest ~2-3 weeks), and then try again.<br /><br /><br />Situation 2: Call from Police<br />You get a call from local police asking you to come in to talk. You&#039;ve recently ordered something, and the package never arrived. The officer may or may not say why they want you to come in.<br /><br />What to do: Go in! No matter what!<br />Option 1: If you have even a half-decent poker face, play the good, innocent citizen card. Play ignorance, and deny that you expected any package to come for you. MAKE SURE TO NOT USE THE WORD ORDER(ed). That will get you caught. Make the situation as light and friendly as you can, and act as a &#039;normal&#039; person would. You have a job, you believe drugs are terrible, etc... If you can think of some reason someone else would send you a package with illegal things, have that up your sleeve if you need it. Local homeless kids trying to use your mailbox, some enemy you&#039;ve made, a spiteful ex-girlfriend, etc... While keeping everything light and innocent, be mindful of what you&#039;re saying. Obviously take care not to say anything incriminating, and keep your mind sharp against any tricks the officer may try to use on you. If you sense that the interview has gotten heavy, and you may be getting into deeper mess, you MUST go to option 2.<br /><br />Option 2: For when you don&#039;t have a poker face, and if option 1 has failed, you switch to this. What everyone else says to do: Don&#039;t say a thing! If you feel like LE already has solid evidence on you, or if the situation just feels too heavy, stay quiet, and demand a lawyer. Doing this makes you seem guilty of something, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s option two. You can and should tell your lawyer everything. They are not legally allowed to divulge any information that you give them. Once you fill your lawyer in, he/she will know how to handle things. Again, when in the presence of LE, be mindful of what you say.<br /><br /><br />Situation 3: Non-LE asking about package confusion<br />Perhaps not a common occurrence, but you&#039;ve ordered a package, and some person, perhaps of the postal service, comes to your door with your package in hand. He&#039;s asking you about something, confirming that this package is for you, or something. Maybe you used a false name when ordering (Which you SHOULD NOT do by the way), idk.<br /><br />What do do: Refer to option 1 of Situation 2! Play it easy and nice. You&#039;re a normal guy who didn&#039;t expect any packages to arrive. Make light conversation, and deny expecting the package.<br /><br />Situation 4: Held in Customs<br />Your package has a tracking number, and you see that you&#039;re package has been held in excess of 5 days by customs. It is released, and it arrives at your house, or wherever you receive it.<br /><br />What to do: While this may not always be the case, chances are your package was checked, and found to have illegal items within. The fact that you&#039;ve received it anyway means that LE is likely watching it. I personally would not take the risk of even opening it, and would act as though it was not meant for me. So upon finding it in your mail box, or on your front step, take a marker and write &#039;RETURN TO SENDER&#039; on the package, placing it back in the box, or taking it to the post office shortly/immediately after finding it.<br />The last thing you want is to take it inside and open it, only to have LE pigs knocking down your door 30 minutes later while you&#039;re trippin acid or lighting up your pipe.<br /><br /><br />Hopefully that will answer some questions many worried buyers have. If you disagree with any of these points, feel free to post, and we can have a discussion! ^_^<br /><br />Cheers,<br />~Toker<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: Posting violence in my thread is strictly prohibited, and I will ask any mods to edit out posts who do not follow this rule. Thank you.

				I disagree with going in if a you get a call from the police. I would simply tell them that I did not wish to talk to them and that if they had questions they may speak with my lawyer. Going in is not good advice IMHO.

				As for going in, at first I agreed with you, but avoiding LE like that does a damn good job at raising suspicion. If we weren&#039;t thinking about suspicion, then we all can just stay quiet and ask for a lawyer.<br /><br />The sad part is that most people don&#039;t care about suspicion.

				oh noes the police suspect me of doing bad things now that I asked for a lawyer but they didn&#039;t when they intercepted drugs coming to me and called me in for questioning, I better try to outsmart them against the advice of every single lawyer ever because I don&#039;t want to look suspicious to them because they are the ones in the grand jury or the jury and also they are the judge

				The police are the ones who decide if you&#039;re even worth looking into. If you can convince them that you haven&#039;t done anything wrong, you don&#039;t even need to mess with jury and judge.

				True enough. I just don&#039;t personally think I would jump straight to asking for a lawyer. I&#039;m confident in my poker face, and my ability not to ramble on and say things I shouldn&#039;t.

				I get what you are saying about looking suspicious OP, but I think that if the police find drugs addressed to you they are already quite satisfied of your guilt.&nbsp; They are just looking for enough evidence to charge you. Yes the package might have been sent maliciously, just like if someone caught with stolen goods might have &quot;found them&quot;. But the nature of their work inclines police to develop a healthy cynicism and realistically the most likely explanation is the drugs were ordered by you.<br />Ignoring their request to come and talk with them is not something they could put before a jury. But if you go in and play the innocent there is nothing to be gained and a lot to lose if you slip up.<br />Don&#039;t make the miastake of thinking they are stupid. Even if they are they have practise at interviewing every day. All the advantage is on their side.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have read so much stuff on line saying there is NEVER anything to be gained from talking to them. Even if you are innocent, which in this case you aren&#039;t. There are plenty of people who thought they could breeze through a police interview now sat in prison.

				they are experts at what they do.<br /><br />you are... not an expert in being interrogated. which will start off as a simple friendly conversation I&#039;m sure :)<br /><br />no one digs a badass in this game. unless you really want to play... then go ahead... play. just make sure your slips don&#039;t <br /><br />effect anyone around you. you may even have a great experience with it. most would choose no. <br /><br />

				A couple of things I would disagree with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lawyers will tell you they are not there to &quot;get you off&quot;. The will tell you that they are there to represent you so you get a fair hearing. If you admit to breaking the law, the fair hearing is that you are guilty which is something people want to avoid. This is based on what I have heard lawyers admit in public, although the amount you pay them may change their mind. I really dont think a public defender will go in to bat for me if I admit to breaking the law.<br /><br />Secondly speaking to LE. Pitting my intelligence against theirs? Seems like a decent idea but it also seems a bit egotistical. They have possibly been working the job for years and the the experience edge. Maybe I am smarter and can talk my way out of it, but if not then I incriminate myself.<br /><br />You are correct when you say there are a lot of threads about the same. What I would say is that there are a lot of threads which have better info as well.

				not going in would be foolish, in the minds of many going in n seeing whats up like any other normal citizen would is a-ok but the moment drugs are mentiond its plead the 5th+&quot;lawyer&quot;. <br /><br />id not even tell my lawyer im guilty, blame it on the dog or the cat but never me. <br />unless they SOMEHOW get into your SR account&nbsp; or find something in your residence that you shouldnt have then heck can they do? <br /><br />so hide the pill press ;)<br /><br />

				A pig&#039;s job is to be suspicious. They will suspect regardless of whether there is a real reason to, or whether you do anything in particular.<br /><br />You cannot get a cop to move along by allaying their suspicions. If they are looking at you... they are already suspicious.<br /><br />There is only one thing which will cause a pig to &quot;move along&quot; and that is the belief that they are not going to be able to make a collar or bust. The only way this happens is if they think you are too careful or lawyered up from the word go.<br /><br />Never talk to them. Period. &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;&quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;&quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; .<br /><br />Whatever you think you may know about dealing with the cops.. matters not one whit. Let a professional handle your interaction for you. &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;.<br /><br />You have (if you are properly paranoid and careful) zero or almost zero experience handling an interrogation or even a semi-casual questioning from a pig who has been doing it day in and out for years or decades. You are the chump. They are the champ. Guess who&#039;s going to fuck up?&nbsp; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;.<br /><br />It really is that simple. &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot; &quot;Lawyer&quot;

				A lot of really good replies. I suppose it comes down to one&#039;s view of police. I personally seem to have a slightly more optimistic view on LE, and most of the time believe in the good in people. However, this standpoint seems to be a minority among the forums, with the majority of people I talk to believing that all cops are inherently out to get you.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to argue that point here, but because of my different viewpoint, I don&#039;t think too many people are going to agree with my OP.

				Each to their own. At least you have provided an intelligent discussion on what people would/should do.<br /><br />I also like to believe people are inherently good. I just believe LE just gets paid to ignore that feeling.
