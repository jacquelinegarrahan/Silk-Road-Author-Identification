				I didnt want to keep my bitcoins on SR, so I created an offline wallet on my computer. i got an address for that wallet to deliver my bitcoins to, and ive tracked the transaction on blockchain, but it says i have 9 confirmations, and yet no money in my bitcoin wallet.. i was wondering if there was a certain amount of time it usually takes for this type of transaction. anyone help?:( :-[
