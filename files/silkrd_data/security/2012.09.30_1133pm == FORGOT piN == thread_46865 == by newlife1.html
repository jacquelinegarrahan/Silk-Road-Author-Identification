				I legit forgot my PIN. It&#039;s asking me to wait 7 days. Can they not verify me any other way to make my account available to me quicker? I really can&#039;t wait 7 days. And yes, I swear I am the original account holder. I deposited money earlier on today in hopes of a transaction but then I don&#039;t remember the pin I made a month ago, this is my first purchase attempt.

				&quot;there&#039;s nothing you can do,&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s making me lose hope. I really would like to speak to the humans that are in charge of the PINs. I am in a very desperate situation here. I need to order the items by tonight so that the seller can ship tom [Monday, USPS opens] in hopes of the items arriving by Thursday. I need it by Thursday or else I lose the customers. Now, if I really didn;t need the money from the customers on Thursday, I wouldn&#039;t have cried out asking for help. But it is extremely urgent and important that I do not flake on Thursday as the money that I will be getting from these proceedings are for a life threatening cause - no joke! Please someone understand? Any one care at all?

It is your responsibility to remember your PIN, not Support&#039;s responsibility to hold your hand here. When you&#039;re registering it tells you in bold beneath the PIN box &quot;DO NOT FORGET YOUR PIN!&quot;<br />As a result you&#039;ll get very little sympathy here - both for the fact that you forgot your PIN in the first place, and you posted this thread in the wrong forum.<br /><br />See the link in my signature for the reasons why you have to wait 7 days.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				&quot;Why does Support make you wait 7 days to have your PIN reset? It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you a week to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.&quot;<br /><br />And how exactly is waiting 7 days protecting the guy&#039;s account if the hacker already has the guy&#039;s password and the new reset pin?<br />Anyway, that is not the case here, I already swore to it and had I known a little earlier that I was going to need it, I would have remembered it.<br />I am not saying I am innocent as I am pleading fully guiltily for not remembering my pin but I am just trying to ask for a helping hand instead of waiting for 7 days. Other wise I have to figure out other extreme measures to get that money in by Thursday.<br />Waiting 7 days or waiting 10 minutes makes no difference in my opinion if the hacker has already compromised the password. And then even if the account was hacked, how would you go about proving to support that the new guy that has your account is the hacker and that you aren&#039;t just trying to get access to that account or shut that accnt down? Waiting 7 days for your funds to be released on a site where the original owner can&#039;t reset the pin and pass based on personal info is just useless.

If your account has been accessed by a third party, the fact that there is a PIN means that they will not be able to transfer funds out of your account. That is the whole reason that there is a PIN. After 5 guesses, the PIN will be locked. This is done in order to make it impossible for a program to crack your PIN in the same way that it may have cracked your password.<br />By waiting 7 days, SR gives the original account holder (who may be someone that doesn&#039;t log in every single day) the option to message SR Support from a new account letting them know that their account has been compromised.<br />You say &quot;that is not the case here, I already swore to it&quot; - do you honestly think that makes a blind bit of difference?!&nbsp; ??? I swear that I&#039;m a unicorn with fingers and opposable thumbs, but just because I&#039;m swearing that it&#039;s true doesn&#039;t make it so.&nbsp; ??? How is anybody supposed to trust the words of a completely anonymous entity?!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46865.msg495667#msg495667">Quote from: newlife1 on October 01, 2012, 12:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Waiting 7 days or waiting 10 minutes makes no difference in my opinion if the hacker has already compromised the password.

Their workload would be cut in half if people remembered their PIN, as instructed to do when registering.<br />I am not going to go into how you can prove to SR Support that you are the person who owns the account, but it&#039;s incredibly simple. Seriously, think a little instead of working your fingers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46865.msg495667#msg495667">Quote from: newlife1 on October 01, 2012, 12:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Waiting 7 days for your funds to be released on a site where the original owner can&#039;t reset the pin and pass based on personal info is just useless.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think that you&#039;re entirely grasping the concept of this anonymous marketplace, the scale of it, nor the security that a 7 day wait provides - if you don&#039;t log in for a number of days and the attacker has managed to compromise both your SR account and your email account, wouldn&#039;t it be terribly foolish for them to email you a link where you could go to reset your PIN, thereby allowing the attacker to do so, and run off with all your Bitcoin?<br />These security measures are in place in order to protect members, not to inconvenience them. Every aspect of this site has been thoroughly thought out and designed with security in mind.<br /><br />To conclude; if it&#039;s useless to you, feel free not to use it. There are countless members who follow the rules, guidelines and instructions and have absolutely no problems. Do not blame the system for your own misgivings.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
