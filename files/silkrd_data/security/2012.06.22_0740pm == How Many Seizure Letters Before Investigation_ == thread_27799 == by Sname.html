				I got a letter from customs yesterday complaining about intercepting &quot;steroids.&quot; I don&#039;t even know what their talking about ;D. Unfortunately, there is a possibility other international packages may be coming to my address in the coming weeks. If my address is flagged, how many letters will I get before I would be formally charged? In theory, these packages would be personal use products but bought in bulk for the discount.

				Honestly, if I were you, I would clean house right now. All but wipe your hard drive, get all drugs and drug paraphernalia out of your house, pay your taxes, help an old lady cross a street...and most certainly stop posting on these forums. I&#039;m sure you would rather be safe than sorry. Btw what country?

				Yeah, you definitely want to live a clean life for a while.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if some of your packages make it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep us updated on how this goes.
