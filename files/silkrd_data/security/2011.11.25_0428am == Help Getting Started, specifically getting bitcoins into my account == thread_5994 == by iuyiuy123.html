				hello all - <br /><br />first off, i think this site is great and i fully support what everyone&#039;s trying to do here. now to my question: can someone post a step-by-step guide for getting bitcoins into my account? or if this is already covered in another thread, please post a link... but so far i haven&#039;t a solid thread that walks newbies through the process. <br /><br />so my question is: how do i get bitcoins into my account? <br />is it safe to do a bank wire transfer into something like tradehill or get-bitcoin.com? and then how do i transfer those bitcoins into my SR account? <br /><br />i set up an acct with tradehill, but when i try to deposit funds into it, it says: &quot;To deposit Bitcoins (BTC) simply send the Bitcoins to your permanent BTC Deposit Address at 17.....&quot; but how do i do that? <br /><br />i&#039;m just looking for step by step instructions with safety and security in mind.<br /><br />thanks to anyone who is willing to help with this.<br /><br />long live SR!

SR, Instawallet, BTC client, etc.), and vice versa. Personally, I think it&#039;s safe buying BTC with your bank account though an exchange. But, I&#039;d tumble them through a couple Instawallets before sending it to your SR account.<br /><br />You should check out the SR wiki, there&#039;s more extensive info there:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

				It takes time to get the ball rolling as I figured out by researching and reading up on things.<br /><br />I personally use Dwolla to exchange money to send to Mt.Gox, where I buy my bitcoins. From there, I use several Instawallet accounts to move it temporarily, then to a tumbler (ex. bitcoinfog), let the bitcoins wash for a couple days, to another couple Instawallet accounts, then all of those finally to SR.<br /><br />Dwolla--&gt;Mt.Gox--&gt;Instawallet (1-&gt;2-&gt;3)--&gt;Tumbler--&gt;Instawallet(4,5,6)--&gt;SR<br /><br />I only buy bitcoins and go through the process when I make purchases. I feel safer that way. Don&#039;t keep any money in Mt. Gox or bitcoins in a one specific location. If so, leave it in the SR account. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Be a little wary of parking your BTC&#039;s in several Instawallets and letting them sit there for several days without checking on them (every day).<br />My sad story:<br />Purchased 145 BTC&#039;s from getbitcoin&nbsp; (a fast operation: I used Western Union on-line to transfer $$ from my credit card to getbitcoin. Probably shouln&#039;t go overboard with that!)<br />Anyway....<br />Once I got my 145, I split it up in 3 instawallets. All was well for 2 or 3 days that I was available to go on-line--however, I had a funeral to attend and was computer-free for a week (Parent&#039;s house)<br />I came back on the eighth day, checked my bookmarks ( you bookmark each Instawallet that you have BTC&#039;s in) and&nbsp; :-[ all three were empty.<br />I keep mentally saying to myself &quot; live and learn....live and learn.....live and learn....)

				Wow, I am incredibly sorry to hear that happened to you my fellow traveler! That is unbelievably unfortunate and understandably upsetting. Do you have any idea what could have caused all three of them to empty like that? <br /><br />If you are looking for a more stable place to hold your coins that is browser based, I have had some coins residing at https://strongcoin.com without incident for some time now. It seems very secure comparatively, the only hitch is they take 1% of each outgoing transfer which isnt too extreme. <br /><br />I may suggest you approach SR and any funds converted to bitcoins as having a high probability of being lost even if only due to value fluctuations or non-delivery... Do not risk money you can not afford to lose, and just do everything you can to minimize the risk. The majority of the time it works out to astonishingly satisfying outcomes. I admire your positive attitude and agree that you can look forward to a brighter tomorrow by learning from our experiences. <br /><br />All the best,<br />- microRiboNucleicAcid
