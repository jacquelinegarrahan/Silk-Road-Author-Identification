				A bitcoin tumbler is a service that obfuscates your coin history with the purpose of hiding the source of of where you obtained your bitcoins. There is a tumbler built into Silk Road. <br /><br />This is not something that you can download.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;key password&quot;. Can you specify its context?

				It can be a bit overwhelming, all the terminology makes it seem confusing.&nbsp; Since you got here, you&#039;ve managed TOR, so you are already getting the hang of things.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to study up a bit on bitcoins, obviously.&nbsp; That is the currency we use here, and it protects us from each other and LE (law enforcement).&nbsp; I suggest going thru the Security forums--as I&#039;ve done--focusing on bitcoins: what they are, and how we get them.&nbsp; Tumblers are just way to make them less tracable.&nbsp; A good &#039;tumbler&#039; is instawallet.org ...&nbsp; I&#039;d study up, buy a few bitcoins, and send them to instawallet.org, so you can see how it works.&nbsp; To buy, after you read thru the forums, I recommend either get-bitcoin.com, which is fairly quick, or dwolla and tradehill.com, which takes longer.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to read up on them.<br /><br />Key is referring to PGP.&nbsp; Another area we&#039;ve all had to learn and study up on.&nbsp; I&#039;d go here: http://www.gpg4win.org/documentation.html&nbsp; That is excellent documentation, and from that site you can download and install everything you need, and then practice up a bit.&nbsp; You will download Kleopatra--or PGA--and then you will make a matching key pair, which includes your private key, which is for you only, and your public key, which you can give to anybody, so they can encrypt messages to you.<br /><br />Obviously it would take pages to explain it all, so this should get you started, and after a day or so of study, you&#039;ll get a better grasp of this.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get discouraged, most of us have had to do the same thing, and, if people see you are studying and trying, then they will be much better about answering the many questions you probably will have.<br /><br />Best wishes.<br /><br />Edit: Saw you already got your pgp stuff, well done!&nbsp; And also, I forgot this vital piece of info&nbsp; OUr Great useful wiki: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

All this triple-walleting and encrypting is a little overblown.<br /><br />Your address is always encrypted, then destroyed when the order ships.&nbsp; Your SR &#039;wallet&#039; virtual location changes EVERY TIME you use it! Which means even if someone is somehow &#039;watching&#039; you on Tor, the bitcoins appear to go to a different wallet every time you re-load, the wallet string is untraceable to SR, its just one of thousands of encryptions here... any one of which would take the best decode software hundreds of THOUSANDS of years to crack! (Why do you think this site has operated for so long while they shut down tunnels all over the mexican border every week?) Even if you type your real name and address in, the minute you hit &#039;enter&#039; or &#039;order&#039; its scrambled.<br /><br />Even if they seize your dealers pc and UN-encrypt that (near impossible and too expensive to try) so what? Addresses are phished all over the place, so yours is in there, somehow...<br /><br />Even here they say DON&#039;T give your real name and address yet a few pages on they say that giving a false name is a waste of time and the cops don&#039;t care what your name is if you got busted with shit on your person, or in-room.&nbsp; Name Address? Who cares? They need to catch YOU with stuff!<br /><br />Having encryption software on your PC is in itself a big red light to the LE if they troll through it. (i keep Tor off my system entirely).<br /><br />But wait, how fucked is this next bit... no one encrypts their many thousands of sometimes VERY incriminating posts here! <br /><br />I may be new but after the initial newbie panic, and struggle with encryption, I stepped back and started THINKING...<br /><br />Now I can see a shitload of paranoia here, fostered by the culture of post 9/11 fear and the &#039;excitement&#039; of the illicit goings-on -and I don&#039;t buy it.<br /><br />Much of what passes for &#039;personal security&#039; on SR by members is all as knee-jerk as the fucking useless harassment of the TSA! <br /><br />Even if this site is hacked... they still have to trace your posts to you, and how they gonna do that on tor?<br /><br />Everyone chill the fuck out! ;D
