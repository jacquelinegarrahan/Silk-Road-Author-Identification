				Hey, I&#039;m looking for some opinions on my &#039;situation&#039; if in fact there is one.<br /><br />I took plenty of precautions to stay as anonymous as possible before making my first purchases here. Coming to the Security section of the forum was a big help, and I made sure to research as thoroughly as I could before initiating any transactions. I will admit I am somewhat suspicious of the whole Tor deal, but seeing as I can&#039;t prove anything either way and it&#039;s one of the best options open to us that I can see, I&#039;ll leave that aside for now.<br /><br />So I had peace of mind to a certain extent until very recently when IRL, one of my relatives (who knew about my excursions in these parts) got a call from a friend, and proceeded to openly declare all the details about the purchases I made as if it were merely part of everyday conversation; my method of payment, a rough time frame of the arrival of the goods, and (believe it or not) my name, which unfortunately for me is fairly unique. Being in the same room it took me about half a minute to realise what had just happened, because after all the time I&#039;d invested in trying to keep this thing on the down low, here was my relative basically blowing my cover like it was nothing. Ever since then my mind has been racing and I have no idea what to do, seeing as I basically just got fucked over by the one person who I entrusted this information to, and that was the LAST thing I was expecting to happen.<br /><br />The few things he didn&#039;t spill were the name of the site I bought from, login details (which thankfully he doesn&#039;t know) and an exact date of arrival.<br /><br />Just a few vague details to put this into perspective - I live in the UK where black-box monitoring of all mobile phone calls and internet traffic is now common practice and considered legal. The goods that I purchased are small amounts of (illegal) psychedelics for personal use, with no intent to become anything more than the occasional buyer. Basically I&#039;m quite worried and obviously angry about this predicament but I was wondering if anyone here would offer any advice as to what they would do in my situation, assuming of course that it wouldn&#039;t just be like closing the door after the horse has bolted.<br /><br />Should I be worried?&nbsp; :-[

				How stupid is your relative?&nbsp; Sounds like he needs to get learned.<br /><br />It&#039;s doubtful something may happen over the phone call but if you&#039;re worried, clean house.<br /><br />Also, explain the risk and dangers to your idiot relative.

				I think you may be working yourself up a bit. The thing is the situation is all still under your control. Make sure your relative understands not to spread it anymore. Move stash if needs be.

				Well first of all, LE aren&#039;t going to bust a small-time user.<br />Think of how you are represented here, do you sound like if they&#039;d bust you spending hundreds paying guys to come over and talk to you, whatever, is it worth it?<br />For saftey&#039;s sake, keep your house clean and FUCK THAT GUY OFF.<br /><br />Damn... I know those feels man, it does it very stressful.<br />Cry if you can, feels amazing.<br />Honestly, you&#039;re fine though, I can&#039;t see you getting into anything.<br />Who was he giving this information to?<br /><br />Y&#039;know what this is, another learnign step, it took me some fucking rough ones too, make sure you laern frmo this.<br />Generally, each time you learn, it&#039;s to be more and mroe secretive.

				All the more reason you should never tell anyone about your SR use, ever, unless maybe it&#039;s like your brother or best friend, you are talking business, and you have more shit on him than he has on you. If possible, tell no one at all. Just say you got the drugs from some dude IRL if people don&#039;t leave you alone. I doubt you&#039;ll see any legal repercussions as a result of what you described in the OP, but then again you&#039;re in the UK so who knows. It would be really fucked up if you actually got arrested or even questioned for that.

				Your worrying FAR to much mate. <br /><br />The Police are not going to be interested in a small time buyer/user. If they did we would all be fucked by now.<br /><br />Take a deep breath, count to ten. Ive done some ridiculous things in the past&nbsp; (i.e transactions on private forums that got busted, had ALL my order history and even my address as some numpty PM&#039;d me it to confirm, asked publicly on Topix for contacts and left me e-mail address, sent my address for samples that never turned up to 4/5 people) all not using TOR etc.<br /><br />I have never had a hint of any Police action or Police knowing about me. I have a clean record and hope it stays that way.<br /><br />Jah Bless

				yeah honestly mate...don&#039;t worry.! It amazes me on here the level of paranoia sometimes. I&#039;m guessing your relative was just gushing excitedly to the freind? Maybe boasting proudly about you? &quot;yeah its cool we&#039;re getting (x) of the internet you use these things called bitcoins&quot; He was probably surprised when you went mental at him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you any reason to think your calls are being monitored? I mean have you any idea of the huge quantities of class A drugs that are being sold in your town on a daily basis? The police are not recording your calls, I think I can state that with a fair amount of confidence.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thats not to say that we all shouldn&#039;t take as many precautions as possible, but when something like this does go wrong, there is really no need to panic. I wouldn&#039;t fall out with your relative over it. My brother would of LOVED this site; unfortunately he died a few years ago....you should make peace with your relative and enjoy the drugs together, (while perhaps advising him to be more discreet in future!) My bro and me used to order K, psychedics, GBL valium and allsorts over clearnet using our real emails....never had any problems! This site is pretty safe.<br />At the end of the day though, we are getting illegal drugs posted to us....you need a certain level of equimanity and fatalism about it....its never going to be risk free! I always think when people get so worried; if its going to cause you so much stress, don&#039;t do it!

				Lesson learned.&nbsp; This site has been very good helping me become cognoscente of how much low hanging fruit there is for LE to just snap up.&nbsp; I am amazed at how even very bright people I am acquainted with are so loose lipped and lackadaisical.&nbsp; I just keep my shit locked down and avoid all those random texts, calls and conversations that are unnecessary but tempting to engage.&nbsp;
