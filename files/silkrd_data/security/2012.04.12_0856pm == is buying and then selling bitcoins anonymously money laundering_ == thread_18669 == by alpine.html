If however you earn an income as I do from trading in BTC, in theory you should declare this on your tax return and failure to do so would be a felony in the USA and a crime in the UK where I&#039;m from.<br /><br />It&#039;s worth saying in the first instance that Bitcoins are designed to be an anomymous system of currency so the point is fairly moot but the answer to your question is no, it wouldn&#039;t be illegal. If you buy a drug addict&#039;s motorcyle for cash and he then uses that cash to buy a gun to hold up a liquor store, the responsibility would legally fall squarely upon his shoulders, even though you&#039;d done business before.<br /><br />The law is less clear about the kind of business I am in whereby you assist in transforming the proceeds of Bitcoin sales from illegal activities into legitimate money. It&#039;s not in itself illegal to make the conversion however knowingly accepting a consideration from the proceeds of crime does place you in a questionable position legally. <br /><br />In practice however this is not an issue as if I choose to mail you 100 dollars in exchange for 25 Bitcoins, it would be near impossible to detect the transaction had taken place. Moreover it would be extremely difficult to prove that those particular Bitcoins a) belonged to you and b) had been earned illegally, as there are many lawful uses for them.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is illegal to launder money, whether you use Bitcoins or regular cash to do it. However trading in Bitcoin does not in itself mount to money laundering, that&#039;s simply one type of crime that can be committed through the Bitcoin network.<br /><br />V.

				Using bitcoin mixes is money laundering. Using bitcoin to pay for drugs may be money laundering in itself. Bitcoin is somewhat of a legal gray area right now afaik, but they could probably try and say it is money laundering depending on how you go about using it. <br /><br />Actually being a bitcoin exchanger is almost certainly illegal in the USA unless you have licenses and follow some sort of know your customer regulations.

				If trading in Bitcoin amounted to money laundering exchanging Linden Dollars on Second Life would be too - No, I think this is a rather narrow interpretation of the law.<br /><br />A bitcoin mixer simply swaps your Bitcoins for someone else&#039;s. It is true that it makes it close to impossible to detect the passage of Bitcoins through a network from one person to another. It&#039;s also true to say that Bitcoin mixing services can be used (and are!) for money laundering services. This said, running an exchange of this nature is no more illegal than exchanging any other kind of virtual currency for another, for which a licence is not required. <br /><br />As I said before however the point is moot in any case as Bitcoins are designed to be used anonymously. KYC procedures would rather defeat the point of the exercise.<br /><br />In theory if you did earn an income from exchanging or trading in Bitcoins, this should be declared and taxed but in practice it would be extremely difficult to detect unless you were stupid enough to transfer large unexplained sums of money to your bank account.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18669.msg187904#msg187904">Quote from: kmfkewm on April 13, 2012, 06:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Using bitcoin mixes is money laundering.

Splitting finances over multiple accounts to avoid being investigated for money laundering is pretty much the textbook definition of account structuring, which is in itself chargeable under money laundering statutes. Not to mention bitcoin mixes exist for the sole purpose of obfuscating the source and or destination of money, which is essentially the textbook definition of money laundering.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No person shall, for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section 5313 (a) or 5325 or any regulation prescribed under any such section, the reporting or record keeping requirements imposed by any order issued under section 5326, or the record keeping requirements imposed by any regulation prescribed under section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or section 123 of Public Law 91–508— [...] (3) structure or assist in structuring, or attempt to structure or assist in structuring, any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As I said before however the point is moot in any case as Bitcoins are designed to be used anonymously. KYC procedures would rather defeat the point of the exercise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First I would like to say that bitcoin was not designed with anonymity in mind. If they wanted to they could have built anonymity right into the protocol, but they didn&#039;t for whatever reason (possibly in an attempt to make it less blatantly money laundering) and anonymity needs to be layered on with third party mixing services. Bitcoin is actually very much not anonymous, the entire transaction history is viewable by anyone and it is entirely non-obfuscated. Using Tor with Bitcoin can give you network layer anonymity, but that is because Tor was designed for anonymity and has next to nothing to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoins primary design goal appears to be censorship resistance, it will be infinitely harder to end Bitcoin versus centralized E-currency companies like E-gold. Bitcoin also aimed to be seizure/forfeiture resistant, since you control your own keys which control your bitcoins, third parties can&#039;t steal them from you. Bitcoin also of course aims to do all the things that any other E-currency aims to, let you send and receive value over the internet. Alas, anonymity is not a property of bitcoin.<br /><br />Second, I would like to point out that the government doesn&#039;t give a flying fuck what bitcoin was designed to do, if you don&#039;t follow know your customer rules and run a financial exchange it isn&#039;t going to do a bit of good to argue that the software you use was designed for anonymity and that following the governments know your customer rules would be counter productive to this end goal. Running any sort of financial exchange without following the applicable know your customer and licensing rules is illegal.

In practice money laundering is essentially anything that involves money that the government has not explicitly approved. Several E-currency exchangers and services have been busted in USA and charged with money laundering, even ones that were apparently taking some efforts to follow the law. You would really need to have solid brass balls to operate a bitcoin exchange in USA unless you get written permission from the government saying that you are allowed to do so (probably in the form of some license) + keep detailed records on each of your customers + fully comply with suspicious activity reporting laws etc etc etc.

I do this for someone close to me who lives in New Zealand (I am English). I use my bank account to buy Bitcoins via Intersango, then move the coins to BitNZ, sell them and withdraw them to my friend&#039;s NZ bank account. It is true that there is a layer of deniability to this transaction but it is not illegal in itself.<br /><br />The question of whether the exchange themselves are laundering money comes down to whether their trade constitutes offering a financial service. The IRS in the USA was able to pin this on E-Gold despite the fact the organisation didn&#039;t own a bank account. As I said the point is moot in any case as it&#039;s possible to set up and run an exchange anonymously, although such exchanges have not enjoyed much success in practice.<br /><br />V.

I can show a few sources of government officials claiming that bitcoin = money laundering, and there are plenty of cases of centralized e-currencies and exchangers being charged with money laundering, and bitcoin mixing has been called structuring and money laundering by at least one legal analyst (I can&#039;t find that link atm but might dig it up later) .... but I can&#039;t point to any specific law (other than in regards to structuring)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">What he does go after, however, is Bitcoin:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;It&#039;s an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money, and to disguise who&#039;s both selling and buying the drug,&quot; said Schumer. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br /><br />it is also pretty obvious that exchangers lawyers are telling them that the government will consider them as financial exchangers (which they are) and regulate them as such<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">TradeHill Chief Executive Officer Jered Kenna cited “increasing regulation” and a lack of funds. “TradeHill can not operate in it’s [sic] current capacity without proper money transmission licensing … [W]e have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and pursue licensing while raising funds,”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Any attempt to hide money to avoid taxation could be considered money laundering...&nbsp; I was more under the impression that OP was simply asking if buying and subsequently reselling btc was, in and of itself, a form of money laundering- but I could have misunderstood the question.<br /><br />If the income is claimed, and taxed, then no, it&#039;s not laundering.&nbsp; How could it be?&nbsp; If an attempt is made to shield money from taxation, then I would say absolutely.

				buying and selling bitcoins for profit might be illegal if you don&#039;t have the proper licenses, but I am sure that depends to a large extent on the scale you do it. There is a difference between trading your twenty euros to your friend for some dollars, and setting up a business that exchanges euros and dollars.&nbsp;
