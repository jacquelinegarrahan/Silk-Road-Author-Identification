				Hi folks just got everything figured out with silk road apart from this PGP deal, from what I gather it is for encrypting your address when sending it to the seller.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m about to make my first order tomorrow and I&#039;m wondering if I can send the seller my address through SR without using&nbsp; pgp encryption?<br /><br />I will get reading up on it now as I understand it is probable the sensible thing to do but for the time being I&#039;m wondering if it is possible to order without using it. <br /><br />Thanks

				Your name and address is the MOST sensitive peice of information in this site.&nbsp; I do whatever it takes to protect that.&nbsp; Even if you used a fake name and drop, you still dont want to make that place hot.&nbsp;

				Vendor_Joe has public and private keys. He sends you his public key. You encode with Vendor-Joe public key and Vendor_Joe decodes the message using Vendor_Joe private key and Vendor_Joe private key password.<br /><br />If you want vendor-Joe to send you an encoded message then you must provide him with noblesavage_public key. <br /><br />You have secret noblesavage private key and password to decode this message.<br /><br />

				Iv got it now guys. I encrypted it saved the encryption and opened it as a notepad file. I assume that when it odes come to making an order I just paste that into the name and address box and wait for the seller to decrypt it.
