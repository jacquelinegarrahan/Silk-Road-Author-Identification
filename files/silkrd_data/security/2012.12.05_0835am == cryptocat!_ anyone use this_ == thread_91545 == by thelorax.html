				... Um, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to say no.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t touch it, personally, but I&#039;m a little more cautious than most I think.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;ll work fine.&nbsp; Maybe it won&#039;t.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t recommend it though.

				I have used it for non SR related nonsense.<br /><br />There are a few &quot;issues&quot; if you are thinking about having fully anon conversation with it.<br /><br />#1 Note it doesn&#039;t not say &quot;anon&quot; anywhere. It only says &quot;encrypted&quot;. This is to say that your location (via IP) could be deduced.<br />#2 you could push your browser through a proxy (AKA Tor) and then your location would technically be obfuscated.<br />#3 Its browser based (at least it was...) That is way too limiting to me.<br />#4 is it java script? If so all the usual &quot;Tor be-careful&quot; rules apply. It could leak your real IP address/ location.<br />#5 Why not use &quot;Torchat&quot;?<br /><br />...its a client that gives you all the benefits of Tor with the ability to IM.<br /><br />I offer Torchat to my customers. I have my Torchat &quot;ID&quot; on my vendor profile....in case you need a friend.&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Well there are two points.<br />1. Contents. You have no idea if Cryptocat is not currently controlled by FBI or whatever. Public key of the other side can be fake. So never share any personal info through it. When 3rdparty with its remote servers involved, there would always be a risk.<br />2. Anonymousity. Cryptocat does not hide the connection fact itself, so use it behind i2p/tor layer (xdtfje3c46d2dnjd.onion) only. <br /><br />btw, as Shroomeister said, torchat is much safer, IMHO.
