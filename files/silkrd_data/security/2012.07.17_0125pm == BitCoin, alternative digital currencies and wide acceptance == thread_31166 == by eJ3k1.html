				So, I created this thread so we could philosophize a bit about the future of BitCoin.<br /><br />Do you guys think there will be alternative crypto-currencies, ie competitors of BitCoin, in the future? Talk in the BitCoin community says that if BitCoin ever gets accepted by the big public, the value of a BTC will skyrocket. And there&#039;s people who appear to be holding on to thousands of BTC&#039;s solely for that reason.<br /><br />But if BTC ever gets widely used, I think that means that the whole idea of digital currency get&#039;s widely accepted. I suspect that in such a scenario, various alternatives will also pop up. And along with that, various exchange sites, etc. <br /><br />BitCoin is designed to mimic regular currency. However ever since the early days, there have always been various types of coins competing, and today it&#039;s still going on. Why couldn&#039;t that happen with digital currency?<br /><br />How do you guys predict the future of BTC?

				I don&#039;t think governments are too happy about it. I can definitely see the government trying to shut it down. It kind of allows us to bypass their whole system. Can you imagine a future where you work for someone and get paid in bitcoins lol. You can use bitcoins to buy food, shelter etc lol.<br /><br />I can see it going one or two ways really; 1. the government shuts it down, says its allowing terrorism, organized crime etc. 2. it skyrockets like you said and becomes a kind of global currency. I really can see both happening, but idk I&#039;m not an economist lol! Fun to think about though!<br /><br />:)<br />-dimethyltryptamine

I imagine the most attractive type will be one which is decentralised like the Bitcoin but doesn&#039;t require a publicly searchable block chain to require anonymity - how this would be done of course is anybody&#039;s guess - I&#039;m just a banker, perhaps our more gifted SR users can enlighten us as to what steps have already been taken in this direction.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />
