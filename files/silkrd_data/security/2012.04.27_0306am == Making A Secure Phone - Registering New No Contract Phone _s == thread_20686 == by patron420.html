				Ok guys, i&#039;ve got a pretty legit communication setup i&#039;m about to implement to communicate with people IRL. I&#039;m looking for a way to make a burn phone. You always see people getting prepaid phones for drug dealing. However communications also need to be secure while using the phone. I think i&#039;ve found a good setup but I need steps on the activation procedure. I was looking at prepaids, but secure comm is going to require data usage. No pre pay plans allow smartphones to use data.<br /><br />So this requires signing up for a no contract type phone. I&#039;m looking specifically at T-Mobile with the Samsung Gravity Smart. This is a SIM card phone, prepay type-able, &amp; runs android OS (get to that in a minute).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know exactly what is needed to register a no contract phone. My one friend told me I buy the phone &amp; call in &amp; provide random name, address, etc &amp; it gets activated. I know this is how prepaids work, but i&#039;m looking at the $50 T-mobile unlimited everything &amp; not sure if it&#039;s also the same with a no contract type plan.<br /><br />I want to go to a physical store &amp; pay cash for the phone, but not really have them register it for me. I would rather call in to a activation phone # &amp; give fake info. Can anyone verify if this is how T-Mobile no contract plans work? I figure I can give an apt complex address with a random name &amp; apt #, register account online, only access account through Tor, &amp; pay account with prepaid visa/mc debit cards each month. Change out sim whenever I need a new #.<br /><br />Now, why it needs android &amp; a data package is for secure communications. There are some really great advances in security to be had with a smartphone nowadays. For call encryption there is cellcrypt &amp; Gold Lock, however a license for one phone for either app is over $1K, not feasible for most of us. However I also stumbled upon Kryptos. It is a $10/month for the app for android which is suppose to encrypt all calls with 256bit AES keys. $120 a year is a damn good alternative to over a $1K license per phone. So now that we have secure military grade calls in place, let&#039;s secure our texting.<br /><br />There is textsecure from whispersystems, but they have been bought out by Twitter so they sketch me out that gov&#039;t is now involved with them, even though the program is opensource/GPL. Gibberbot is a better looking alternative which supports OTR, which is a plugin i&#039;m familiar with &amp; know it&#039;s secure. Only downside is you have to register an account &amp; so do the people that wish to communicate with you, it&#039;s not really &quot;text messaging&quot; anymore. <br /><br />The best looking alternative that i&#039;m about to try with my friend who also has a android phone is Cloak SMS. It looks like a phone version of what we do on SR everyday, just automated. He showed me the app, &amp; I stressed it must have encryption during transmission, which he said it did. It looks like it generates a certificate key based off your phone when you first run the app, just like we have our PGP public keys here. You type your message &amp; i guess click send or whatnot &amp; it prompts for password to do encryption then transmits your message as an encrypted pgp message to the other android device in which they then paste the message into a box that auto runs everything &amp; asks for there password to decrypt it just like we do &amp; displays the output.<br /><br />With calls encrypted &amp; texts encrypted I mean they can still triangulate your ass, but they should never be able to tap you to know wtf is going on for it to ever get to the point of them needing to triangulate you.<br /><br />So now is the main reason why I posted this thread. I have no idea what is required to sign up for a no contract phone. Is ANY ID at all required or anything that requires me to identify who I am? I assume all payments can be made electronically with prepaid visa/mc debit cards that are loaded with cash, is this correct?<br /><br />Anything else anyone would like to add about secure phone communication options.

				I sell encrypted phones if you are interested. If not Gold-Lock is the way to go, it&#039;s what I/the people I work with use and we all have contract phones.
