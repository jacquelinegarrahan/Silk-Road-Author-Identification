				So I placed an order using pgp for my address with a vendor that I&#039;ve used several times before. He/she messaged me and said <br />&quot;Hey,<br />Well, this is embarrassing, but I&#039;m gonna need for you to try again. Not only did I generate new keys, but I also changed computers; and I have managed to fuck things up royally, I guess. So--if you don&#039;t mind, can you try with this key? All I need is your shipping info. Thanks again,&quot;<br /><br />I imported the new key they gave me in the message and the emails do not match up with the previous key. Also, there&#039;s no mention of a new key on the vendor&#039;s profile or forum thread.<br />Any reason to be cautious of this?<br />Should I post the new and old keys for you guys to look at and inspect??<br />Call me paranoid but it&#039;s not like I want my door kicked down any time soon...<br /><br />EDIT:: the vendor does state on his profile that he has a new key but...it matches neither his old one that I used to place an order less than a month ago with nor the new one he sent me via pm...

				I wouldn&#039;t go through with it. Even with a trusted vendor, it isn&#039;t worth the risk.

				@sellmebulk--no it&#039;s not just because they changed their key. It&#039;s because 1) their email for their old key and the new one don&#039;t match ((for example the old one was vendorname@tormail.org and the new one is vendorname@tormail.net...why would they be using an old, outdated email, like tormail.net that isn&#039;t correct anymore for their New pgp key?)), 2) their message just seemed a bit off to me. Didn&#039;t seem like the same writing style as previous comms., 3) the key on their profile that they say is the new one isn&#039;t the same as what they sent me.<br />The whole thing is just weird and I&#039;d rather not take the chance of giving my address to someone I don&#039;t know, even if I&#039;ve ordered from them before.

				I frequently change my PGP and email (usually every few months) but as a buyer it&#039;s fine.&nbsp; For a seller you have to put more trust in them.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be overly worried, but be careful.

No I have never thought of doing that. Im pretty consistant with my language and offers/behavior with my clients. I hope they can see that and not get sketched. Def will start doing that next time I want to change it. But I have a good setup now, should be secure for a while. I def understand being cautious. But some people are way paranoid. Personally I dont think LE is hijacking and setting up accounts to bust buyers. Thats working backwards. Im more cautious of the buyer than vendor. The situation that started this thread though was sketch and I would have done the same thing.
