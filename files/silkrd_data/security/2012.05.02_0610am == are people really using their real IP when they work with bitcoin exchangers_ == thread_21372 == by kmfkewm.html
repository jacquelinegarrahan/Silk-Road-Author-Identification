				That sucks if it is the case. You need to find a way to be anonymous when you buy and sell bitcoins. There is absolutely no point in using anonymous cash in methods if you connect to the exchanger from your real IP address. Buy a private VPS anonymously and connect to it via Tor, then use the VPS for exchanger stuff. Or find an exchanger that doesn&#039;t lock accounts that they see proxies connecting to. At the very least use open WiFi from a random location when dealing with them.

				I agree. If you use get-bitcoin.com from behind Tor. Have the BTC sent to an instawallet. Use a Tor-friendly email (hushmail works fine for this), and remove exif data from the image you send of your BoA deposit receipt. Very, very secure.

				We badly require a book, SR for Dummies or something.<br /><br />In general, there&#039;s a bizarre combination of paranoia and laxity. Too much focus on tech security and not enough on the human element.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a non-exhaustive list of 10 peculiar things I&#039;ve seen. Check it for your sins...<br /><br />1. Many people are actually using the same handles or avatars on the clearweb. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Including some of the most paranoid people on here. Without using a single &#039;hack&#039;, I could easily ID 25% - 50% of the people on here. No, that&#039;s not me boasting, that&#039;s you being insecure.<br /><br />2. Too lazy to use PGP encryption.<br /><br />3. Mentioning they were at specific locations and dates, or worst yet, that you will be in the future.<br /><br />4. Using colloquial slang.<br /><br />5. Mentioning specific clearweb sites that they have accounts on.<br /><br />6. Indirectly or directly referring to the time. e.g. This afternoon I... etc<br /><br />7. Mentioning you&#039;re going to purchase, or have purchased, certain items from Ebay or Amazon.<br /><br />8. Imagining that using Tor doesn&#039;t influence how banks, exchanges, email providers and others could profile you. You use Tor to access proxies which are ideally private and located in your geographical region. Unless you think it&#039;s not weird for your bank to see you&#039;re accessing your account from Bermuda, and then Belize ten minutes later. See: &quot;I have my rights&quot; section below -&gt;<br /><br />9. Mentioning your jobs past, present or future, and people you know.<br /><br />10. Mentioning any government controlled data relevant to your person. e.g. prescription drugs you&#039;ve taken, when and for how long, how long you&#039;ve been unemployed, your crazy bitch ex-wife, how much tax you paid, and unbelievably: that you have a criminal record etc.<br /><br />Some General Rules:<br /><br />Never, never believe that just because something is legal, that means that it can&#039;t be used against you in some way. Enough with this &quot;I have my rights&quot; bullshit already. It&#039;s called circumstantial evidence and prosecutors use it all the time.<br /><br />Many Nos make a Yes. It&#039;s a combination of both additive and subtractive knowledge that builds an investigative case. Tor allows you to give a detective the universal set of 7 billion people to extract you from. Why narrow the field?<br /><br />Remember Occum&#039;s Razor. The simplest model that fits the known facts is usually true. For example: some of you were proposing that SR itself was colluding with scammers. But why would they even do that when they could more easily simply embezzle all your money in the first place? Similarly, intelligence agencies like the NSA and CIA do not have mandates to find drug dealers. It&#039;s not in their jurisdiction. The local police, FBI and DEA do have such mandates and it is in their jurisdiction. Simple!<br /><br />If you have committed security sins, or even if you haven&#039;t, then you had better start putting down some red herrings. It&#039;s just good practice to drop the occasional white lie as a matter of principal. <br /><br />-- Agent SuperPine<br /><br /><br />

Certainly for some of us, finding that out would be quite difficult. Nevertheless, yes, you can build a certain profile out of people&#039;s posts and use other educated guesses. By far the easiest way though, is to make a positive ID by simply asking people for their addresses. e.g. come to my special discount website. Have my free samples of felony quantities. Buy your B$ for SR with credit card and Paypal here at clearwebexchange.com etc<br /><br />In case you think I&#039;m making the last one up, there was a guy on here a couple of hours ago doing just that. QuickBitcoin or something like that. He deleted the posts though. It was so blatant that I wondered if he was legitimate and just very stupid. He had a special code for SR users to enter onto his website and everything.<br /><br />

				You don&#039;t have to be totally anonymous just to buy and sell small amounts of bitcoins. A vendor does, but the buyer doesn&#039;t need to unless you are buying a barrel of Ephedrine from India for $15,000.<br /><br />You could say somebody on IRC sold you a service for bitcoins and you sent the coins to that address. They can&#039;t prove otherwise that this didn&#039;t happen because bitcoin is decentralized and allows for 3rd party payments. How are they going to get DPR&#039;s priv keys to all his escrow addresses he&#039;s ever generated to match up with your transaction and at the same time get you to confess because unless there&#039;s evidence on your comp or SR usernames linking you to it and you talk they aren&#039;t going to be able to prove shit in a court of law.<br /><br />Remember there are people selling heroin and stolen Oxy&#039;s for paypal on Topix for years and still have yet to be busted.

				Sometimes I feel like writing a &quot;SR for dummies&quot; on here but I feel like it would only help LE, what do you guys think? I think the main problem is the &quot;they wouldn&#039;t bother with a small time buyer&quot; mentality which causes SR users to be lazy or to just stay ignorant because of this mentality.

It&#039;s simple to counteract, just don&#039;t use identifiers you use on other websites -&gt; usernames, emails, avatars. Like kmf has been saying so frequently, it&#039;s the &#039;I&#039;m not hurting anybody so I&#039;m a good person and the law can&#039;t touch me&#039; baggage that&#039;s the root of this. If you are posting, or even reading this forum, the the law considers you a criminal, it merely remains to prove it. It&#039;s no good thinking there&#039;s no laws on the books that prevent you reading or talking about drugs, there are, the criminal conspiracy laws are extremely wide ranging, and in most cases are very suspect.<br /><br />I mean, you don&#039;t even actually have to sell drugs, to be convicted of drug trafficking offenses. I kid you not. As long as LE can show you &#039;intended&#039; to sell drugs, that is more than enough.&nbsp; This is universal, in Australia, if you are caught selling tablets which are placebos, but marketed or inferred that they were MDMA, then you go to prison for as long as if you actually had sold them. Similar rules apply in America. This is from DEA guidelines:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Defendants convicted of conspiracy or an attempt to commit any offense involving a controlled substance warrant the same level as if they had completed the object of the conspiracy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Furthermore, merely having an account on SR, whether you acquired drugs or not, makes you guilty of criminal conspiracy. People don&#039;t understand these laws at all. They are very draconian. Essentially, LE has given up because it&#039;s not smart enough or has enough resources to actually prove anybody broke the law. So they apply a new kind of a law, called the conspiracy laws, which are quite literally straight out of the Middle Ages (England in 1305) Again, the DEA says:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A conspiracy is an unlawful agreement by two or more persons to violate the law. Whether or not the persons accomplished what they conspired to do is immaterial to the question of guilt or innocence in regard to a conspiracy. The success or lack of success of the conspiracy doesn’t matter. The laws of the United States and many individual states provide that if a defendant is convicted of a conspiracy to commit any offense involving a controlled substance, the punishment is the same as if the object of the conspiracy had been completed. In other words, the punishment is identical to the crime the conspirators sought to commit. Conspiracy is not a lesser-included offense of the object of the conspiracy; it is a separate crime within itself. If the conspiracy ended before the goal of the conspiracy could be accomplished, this fact alone does not absolve the conspirators of their crime.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Notably:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whether other members of the conspiracy knew the crimes were going to be committed or even if they discouraged other members from committing these crimes is irrelevant. The prosecution must only show that these crimes were committed to further the goal of the conspiracy. The prosecutor does not have to prove that as a member of the conspiracy, the defendant either participated in, or even knew of the existence of these crimes, only that he was a member of the conspiracy at the time they were committed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You know, even the Old Testament, not exactly a model for 21st century judicial proceedings, says the crimes of the father shouldn&#039;t result in punishment on the child. The basic concept that scapegoating is fundamentally unfair. Yet under the law of the USA, if one of us murders another person to further his drug enterprise, then we are all held accountable as if we had committed murder ourselves despite not knowing each other, aiding or abetting that person in any way. There are caveats to conspiracy laws as there are for all legal matters, but the gist of them, is what I&#039;ve just told you. These laws are not almost Orwellian, they actually are 1984 inventions, where thought-crime is prohibited. <br /><br />Now, whether those laws are enforceable, now that is a different matter. But that is the law.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21372.msg219393#msg219393">Quote from: a_blackbird on May 02, 2012, 04:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I&#039;d say that&#039;s about the size of it psychologically.

				Ok so let&#039;s say hypothetically that one were to have purchased bitcoins from Mtgox and then transfered it directly to the SR wallet... if said person were to then transfer it through several other wallets in different amounts thereafter and back to SR but to a different wallet address... would that be secure?

Otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be able to update your account balance when you send bitcoin to an address you had previous used on SR.<br /><br />Effectively, SR owns your Bitcoin wallet (as does pretty much any Bitcoin service online). Now, if we were LEO doing blockchain analysis and we had all SR&#039;s private keys and account details associated with them, we could see that Bitcoins entered SR and returned to SR to an account controlled by a single entity. This loop suggests that the transactions were controlled by 1 entity. It is circumstantial evidence rather than hard evidence.<br /><br />For a bitcoin to get recycled in and out of the Silk Road is probably normal, given it&#039;s influence on the bitcoin economy. But for a bitcoin to get cycled from that 1 SR account and then that exact bitcoin comes home later to that same account, that is pretty unlikely in my estimation. If you had a different SR account for it to arrive into, that would be different unless there was a way for LE to show an ownership connection between those two accounts e.g. you sent vendors the same geographical address and it wasn&#039;t encrypted from both accounts.<br /><br />The things to watch out for are:<br /><br />- anonymously obtaining bitcoin or visa versa for your currency.<br />- using Tor network/proxies as described in this thread whenever accessing any wallet related service. e.g. the exchanges, instawallet etc.<br /><br />I am wary of instawallet. It is good and it is popular. Maybe too popular. I would like to see more diversity of temporary instawallet like services being used instead of one entity. I also am concerned that people might be using these services on the clearweb. On the other hand, it&#039;s better than using a wallet on your computer. What if a edition of bitcoin wallet sent your IP address and Bitcoin address to LE? I&#039;m not saying it is happening, only that you can circumvent that possibility in the first place.<br /><br />Again, if you are anonymous in the first place, it is best. Hypothetically you then don&#039;t need to use a mix or pool service for bitcoins. Then even if SR was compromised completely, it would not be relevant. There&#039;s a long way between the cup and the lip from LEO&#039;s perspective, but why make their life easier? Earn your tax payer dollars you animals!<br /><br />tldr; <br /><br />1. Don&#039;t send from exchange to SR wallet directly.<br /><br />2. 100% definitely don&#039;t use clearweb and do No.1 <br /><br />3. If you did 1 or 2, it&#039;s ok, everybody makes mistakes, then put your bitcoin through a mix and use instawallet-like services all of which you are doing through proxies which you are accessing through the Tor network. Then forward your bitcoins to a new SR account or one not associated with your old one. Not associated with your old account. This is the important bit or everything you&#039;ve done could be a waste of time (if SR fell to LE) e.g. use a new PGP public key, don&#039;t send your address to old vendor you used before through your brand new SR account, think it through step by step.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank you pine, i just posted this exact question in security two minutes ago.

Indeed, any financial institution. If you use a private proxy and use Tor to communicate through that proxy, then you are anonymous. It is less likely that they have a list of all the public proxies in the world, but possible they have some of them, hence the private proxy. <br /><br />Suggest reading here: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21578.msg221779#msg221779

Many people are actually using the same handles or avatars on the clearweb. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Including some of the most paranoid people on here.

Too lazy to use PGP encryption.<br /><br />3. Mentioning they were at specific locations and dates, or worst yet, that you will be in the future.<br /><br />4. Using colloquial slang.<br /><br />5. Mentioning specific clearweb sites that they have accounts on.<br /><br />6. Indirectly or directly referring to the time. e.g. This afternoon I... etc<br /><br />7. Mentioning you&#039;re going to purchase, or have purchased, certain items from Ebay or Amazon.<br /><br />8. Imagining that using Tor doesn&#039;t influence how banks, exchanges, email providers and others could profile you. You use Tor to access proxies which are ideally private and located in your geographical region. Unless you think it&#039;s not weird for your bank to see you&#039;re accessing your account from Bermuda, and then Belize ten minutes later. See: &quot;I have my rights&quot; section below -&gt;<br /><br />9. Mentioning your jobs past, present or future, and people you know.<br /><br />10. Mentioning any government controlled data relevant to your person. e.g. prescription drugs you&#039;ve taken, when and for how long, how long you&#039;ve been unemployed, your crazy bitch ex-wife, how much tax you paid, and unbelievably: that you have a criminal record etc.<br /><br />Some General Rules:<br /><br />Never, never believe that just because something is legal, that means that it can&#039;t be used against you in some way. Enough with this &quot;I have my rights&quot; bullshit already. It&#039;s called circumstantial evidence and prosecutors use it all the time.<br /><br />Many Nos make a Yes. It&#039;s a combination of both additive and subtractive knowledge that builds an investigative case. Tor allows you to give a detective the universal set of 7 billion people to extract you from. Why narrow the field?<br /><br />Remember Occum&#039;s Razor. The simplest model that fits the known facts is usually true. For example: some of you were proposing that SR itself was colluding with scammers. But why would they even do that when they could more easily simply embezzle all your money in the first place? Similarly, intelligence agencies like the NSA and CIA do not have mandates to find drug dealers. It&#039;s not in their jurisdiction. The local police, FBI and DEA do have such mandates and it is in their jurisdiction. Simple!<br /><br />If you have committed security sins, or even if you haven&#039;t, then you had better start putting down some red herrings. It&#039;s just good practice to drop the occasional white lie as a matter of principal. <br /><br />-- Agent SuperPine<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />after reading this my first thought was, &quot;impressive.&quot; zooming my browser out after reading your sig and seeing your avatar, my heart skipped a beat. it was love.<br /><br />but then i considered what you just said and realized it was very unlikely pine would have an actual avatar of herself - and that it was actually probably a dude. does that make me gay? oh no, am i gay???!?!?<br /><br />
