				Hello SR travellers,<br /><br />I just have a few questions about BTC and anonymous purchasing. I have some good IRL sources for drugs such as bulk Ketamine, MDMA, Speed etc but I don&#039;t have any source for bulk LSD, Cocaine (this is all related to bulk buying/selling btw).<br /><br /><br />1) Regarding BTC anonymity is the only TRUE way to remain anonymous with regards to coin tracing to remain internal within SR? I.e. I sell MDMA/Ketamine/Speed off on one SR seller account, transfer the coins internally to another SR buyers account and buy my bulk Cocaine/LSD to sell IRL again, use the extra cash to buy more MDMA/Ketamine/Speed stock and repeat the process all over again? Effectively I see this is an unbreakable loop (obviously apart from the fact i&#039;m getting drugs shipped to my house, but we&#039;re all in the same boat with this one.)<br /><br />2) I see this plan saving a lot of hassle with mixers/fees/and BTC purchasing which can sometimes be a headache (especially in large amounts). Also it eliminates the hardest step of all of getting your BTC out of SR and into hard cash without a trace. Can anyone see a hole in this plan?<br /><br />3) To my knowledge the only two TRUE ways of purchasing BTC anonymously are cash in the mail via a trade site like localbitcoins.com or anonymously through a BTC cash in the mail vendor on here (the most anonymous and preferred option). If you want to get real paranoid, the localbitcoins.com option isn&#039;t completely anonymous as you have to access the site via clearnet, using a valid email address making you traceable. Also you may have to meet up in person with said vendor for large transfer amounts like I am talking about. Regarding the second option, this isn&#039;t any use to me at the time of writing as there are NO cash SR vendors offering consistent and large amounts in my area (or any that I trust) so this is out.<br /><br />4) Last question, if I buy a SR seller account (not sure how much this is, 40 BTC?) is this a one off charge, and will I be charged for leaving the account stagnant for a few weeks? Also, does SR JUST charge me 10% per sale I make?<br /><br />I look forward to hearing your replies!<br /><br />;)<br />

				Hey blagga19,<br /><br />Seems like you&#039;ve thought this through. 1 and 2 look pretty solid to me, although the people you sell to IRL are the weak points in your chain. I think you already know that though. I have a similar scheme that I&#039;ve been toying with for a while, and the reliance on the IRL contacts is what is holding me back (or making me hold back). The best thing I can think of so far is a cash-in-the-mail and dead drop arrangement, but I digress.<br /><br />3 is a local/regional thing, can&#039;t help you there unfortunately.<br /><br />I think the answer to 4 is that seller fees are one off, although they changed in the order of 300% without notice so it could change any time.
