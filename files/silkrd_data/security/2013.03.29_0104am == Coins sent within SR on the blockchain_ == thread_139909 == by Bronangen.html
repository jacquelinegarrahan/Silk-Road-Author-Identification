				Are coins sent from member to member via the username option visible on the blockchain? <br /><br />Im worried i may be doing it a bit excessively...<br /><br />Any input is much appreciated, thanks folks.

				AFAIK transactions member to member do not appear on the blockchain since SR has one pool of bitcoins. You are sending 1BTC to your own address essentially. Take my words with a pinch of salt because I don&#039;t know! I can&#039;t see why SR would need to be connected to the blockchain for internal transactions.

				No, I am quite certain there is no record of member-to-member transfers outside of Silk Road.&nbsp; When you deposit to your SR bitcoin address, those coins actually bounce right off that address and are automatically sent on several times over -- that&#039;s the built-in mixer mixing them all up.&nbsp; It just credits your account with the coins in SR&#039;s database; when you transfer to another member, no actual coins are involved.&nbsp; It&#039;s just adjusting the SR database, that&#039;s all.<br /><br />Be warned though!&nbsp; I am not a vendor and have never had experience with such an account.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s true of coins that come out of escrow and go to a vendor&#039;s balance.&nbsp; Those could be actual coins, I have no clue.

				Thanks for the replies guys...I was thinking along the same lines, that perhaps the coins are always in the SR database while being bounced from member to member.<br />This gives me some optimism but it doesn&#039;t seem to be for sure.<br /><br />Oh and to clarify I meant from normal account to another, no vendor&#039;s involved. <br /><br />Thanks again&nbsp; :)

				I certainly wouldn&#039;t worry about too many transactions.&nbsp; SR does a nice job mixing everything up, it&#039;s impossible to tell to any reasonable degree where coins came from when they go into or out of SR.<br /><br />lelmeriodici
