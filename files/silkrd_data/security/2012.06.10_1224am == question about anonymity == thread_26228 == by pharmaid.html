				Being new here and having now made several smooth purchases and sales transactions I&#039;ve just got this&nbsp; &quot;this is too good to be true&quot; feeling going on. I take impeccable care in making my drops in different boxes in surrounding towns, wear gloves, stealthily disguise my shipments, etc. I know many of you have been doing this for many months and I haven&#039;t heard of a single bust via SR.<br /><br />But here&#039;s what I was thinking today. I know how TOR is supposed to work but maybe I don&#039;t understand enough about it.&nbsp; I have made a lot of sales recently and I read on these forums that LE has probably staged themselves as customers and have made purchases in order to gain location intelligence. So let&#039;s take this hypothetical scenario:<br /><br />Suppose I fill an order and ship it out to a buyer who is actually LE. He receives the shipment and sees the post mark on the package revealing the postal facility where it originated which is a small city or a surrounding town of the small city. So therefore LE now knows for sure that someone in that small city region is conducting sales via SR. So now LE goes to the few ISP providers in the small community and asks (with subpoena) which local IP addresses are signed up to and using the TOR system. I would guess that besides me, there aren&#039;t many others. But lets say there are 10 others or even 20 others. Now LE has me narrowed down to one of these 10-20 users. I would think that from this point on it would just be a matter of time before mailboxes are monitored and the pinch is made.<br /><br />Is this theory plausible? Am I being too paranoid? Could LE actually do what I describe here? Does my local ISP know I am using TOR?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				I am by no means an expert but from what I understand a VPN would be more secure, though the exact level of that security would depend on the vpn, if its your own all is well, if its a commercial one they may well give up your location if LE ask them.<br />As I understand it SSH tunneling and VPNs are both pretty secure and using either one in conjuction with tor would give an increase in annonimity
