				I&#039;ve set up an Mt Gox account but noticed a warning after creating the account that cash deposits via Barclays may not be accepted. <br /><br />Has anyone had any problems obtaining bitcoins through the Barclays cash deposit to Mt Gox route? If so were you just asked to verify the Mt Gox account by providing passport and utility bill or was there more to it than this.<br /><br />I&#039;ve enlisted the help of a friend to use his details so that the Mt Gox details are different to both my own details and the SR delivery address, so if the account did have to be verified it wouldn&#039;t be a huge problem. I&#039;ve also changed my MAC address and used public wi-fi when setting up the Mt Gox account.<br /><br />Any information from anyone who has used this method would be appreciated. <br /><br />

				When I used to use Gox a little while back I did around 5-6 cash deposits in a Barclays branch and these all came though fine. (Just make sure they add the reference code in capitals or it can delay funding)<br />Gox advise against you doing cash deposits but myself and a few other people I know have done this without any problems.<br />It should be fine although I would recommend going the bank transfer route if its possible in your situation or maybe looking for a trader and do Ukash/BankXfer &gt; BTC

				I have just setup a new MTGox account through my vpn with a new username and disposable email address (as far as i&#039;m aware there is no way they can associate the account with me as my true IP address is hidden.) <br /><br />Would someone be kind enough walk me through the process of depositing cash with barclays please? <br /><br />Do i just walk in, fill in a form with the details on my MTGox page and hand it over with the cash? <br /><br />Where do i write the message that associates that deposit with my MTGox account? <br /><br />Also i understand i&#039;ll most likely be on their CCTV, would it be a good idea to ask a trusted friend to make the deposit for me? What are the implications of this? e.g. I dont want s/he getting into trouble.<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions but i wanna make sure my tracks are hidden as much as they can be before i make my first purchases on the Silk Road!<br /><br />Thanks

				Mt-Gox have suspended the deposits to the Barclays a/c.&nbsp; The establishment are obviously putting pressure on the BTC exchanges.&nbsp; You might need to search the forums and find some alternative methods to get your coins.<br />Very annoying!<br />cheers<br />PTF
