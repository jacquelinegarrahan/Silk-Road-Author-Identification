Just as we started the rate rocketed so it was quite a busy time. I also had some mug try to fuck my feedback too, I don&#039;t need that stress and haven&#039;t got time - it&#039;s not hard to sell Bitcoins, I don&#039;t need or want that nonsense! So with whats going on recently I&#039;m tentatively considering some trades. <br /><br />Check my vendor page if your after THE safest way to get your coins. There will only be on offer what is on hand so there isn&#039;t going to be a situation where I over stretch and can&#039;t meet orders. The system is a great idea, just because some idiot gave it bad rep there&#039;s no reason to pass on it! <br /><br />Best, GBBTC

				Credit card payments can be subject to a &quot;charge-back&quot; initiated by the cardholder.&nbsp; If you were a bit-coin issuing authority, you would unnecessarily risk every coin you &quot;sell&quot; to a credit card user, because he could call his card company and issue a charge-back.&nbsp; The bit-coin issuer could put a hold on the bit-coins, to keep himself safe, but I think 90 days is the window of a charge-back, and that&#039;s a stupid long hold - aka not economically feasible to use credit cards due to fraud. Debit/Bank might work, but I&#039;m unaware.

				yep, the only real way to go (in the UK at least) is cash in the mail of F2F! It&#039;s safe enough though if using Special Delivery.
