				why do we even have fucking tails/liberte/privatix and a range of other security distros etc etc???<br /><br />what do they have that an ordinary desktop with the tor browser bundle does not have?if it was anything serious, i think tor would highlight it in RED that we should be using them.<br /><br />ive just installed Linux mint with persistence onto my micro SD card....and i have just installed the tor browser bundle...and&nbsp; i must say,its ten times faster....there is a full tor GUI,not some half job....and its the latest version of tor with the aurora browser..which tor themselves have implemented..obviously for security reasons....<br /><br />i must admit, i do feel more secure with my new setup..the reason being...my tor comes DIRECT from the tor project...but with tails...they mess about with it before i use it..and every other security distro does the same....using there own browsers for whatever reason...ultimately, im laying my trust in a third party if i chose these distros.<br /><br />i dunno...<br /><br />

				Everyone seems to think what they are using at the time is the &quot;best&quot; option out there. To say &quot;why do we even have fucking tails/liberte/privatix&quot; is not a lot different that saying &quot;why the fuck is there 500 different strains of marajuana&quot;, or &quot;why are there so many types of cars in the world&quot;.... its because people like &#039;choice&#039;. People have preferences. Creativity, supply &amp; demand. Specific requirements.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of the bootable distro&#039;s, but aside from what I see as their disadvantages, they still have some advantages over what you or I may happen to be using. Carrying a tails CD in your pocket is basically carrying access to SR where ever you go. Sure a laptop works better for me, but that&#039;s not everyone&#039;s preference.<br /><br />By the way, thread title is very catchy&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;m a noob on live distro world, but I think I read somewhere you can pre-cofigurante a liveCD to use some programs. Is it possible?<br /><br />Or you can use a live distro and point the program in your hard drive to use. Is it possible too?

				Sorry, I misunderstood. I was thinking linux mint was not a live distro and you installed it in your hard-drive.<br /><br />But, anyway, you can use a live linux mint with Tor Browser Bundle, so why you can&#039;t use tails/liberty/privatix with it?

				Hey there, RR, you *know* i couldn&#039;t pass up this thread, ha ha, I think I&#039;ve posted, that sometimes I get all sick of it, wonder if it&#039;s necessary, and just use Tor bundle on a flash drive and I&#039;m good....then I&#039;ll bounce back to the more secure junk....lately, I&quot;m stone Tails, and I&#039;ve not messed with the other...but tonite on some other thread, there was a guy who seemed to really know his security, and he pretty much convinced me that it&#039;s good, that we shouldn&#039;t give up on being as secure as we can...but *anyway* just for whatever reasons, here&#039;s a compromise I sometimes use:<br />&nbsp;<br />On forums, use the tor bundle: hell, it&#039;s not illegal to talk, fuck, and since I spend most of my wasted time on here, I feel safe enough withjust the tor bundle on a flash...then I can hop over to chrome and go fast, on the pc, hop over to usb/Tor to talk shit here on forums<br /><br />NOw, I&#039;d never buy anything myself on the main site....but if I *did* what I&#039;d do is then grab a little netbook and go down to the coffeeshop and plug in Tails ...and Tails, as we know, keeps us honest, since it&#039;s all gone and erases itself afterwords....<br /><br />So Tor is cool enough here...anything dicey, can thro in Tails on a little netbook, and go get a coffeee somewhere and use their IP addy....&#039;just in case&#039;&#039; ....<br /><br />sounds like you&#039;re having fun, bro, glad to hear it...I slammed some damned mehadone pills like an idiot, and ...well ... fuck me...I hate this shit, sometimes...<br /><br />Worst thing I&#039;m having, is this laptop, my cursor jumps all over the fucking place...isn&#039;t their some linux app I could thro in my boot, so I can adjust touchpad...this fucker drives me crazy, always erasing everything...it&#039;s one of those modern *three* way touchpads or something...I&#039;ve got it all turned off on the windows side, it&#039;s just when I&#039;m running live linux distro, it gets crazy on me...another reason, of course, that from here on out, I&#039;m just using tor app on the forums, where I spend 99 % of time anyway<br /><br />So, Tor on a stick for the forums....Tails on a stick and get out of dodge for any purchases....
