				So obviousley we sre always using tor, but do you take it a step further by using someone elses isp? I personally have been interested in selling my boomer on here for like a 115.00 a zip for p.cubensis.&nbsp; I dont trust Tor Package for windows.&nbsp; I will impliment a few security measures befoe I vend.<br /><br />1. My computer will be using a SSD with Live edition on it, the hdd will be unhooked.<br />2. For a isp, I will buy a prepaid droid with card and activate with fake info. then i will root it and use it solely and only for sr sales.<br />3. I will never walk away from this computer screen without closing it down so that all ram killed.<br />4. I will keep this computer only for sr sales and never store anything larger than a SD disk which I will keep hidden except for when on seller account<br /><br />5. any and all other personal and professional manners will occur on my normal isp.<br /><br />Does the extra computer with clean hard drive and cellular isp add any level of protection to my business? I&#039;m just not comfortable running tor browser bundle on my personal pc to sell shit.

Never use your home ISP if you are doing to do deals on SR. Just for a measure of extra security, but why go pre-paid?&nbsp; Why not just go to someplace that has free wifi?&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need to go it... just sit at table outside.&nbsp; Obviously this would take some extra time, but just looking at it from a harder to trace pov.

				Visit a bar with free wifi, don&#039;t go to the same one consistently, and try to randomize the times of day you go.&nbsp; Also, encrypt that Solid State Drive (with something like TrueCrypt)!&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure how the cellular plan would be too much better, than just going to a free wifi place (Pros/Cons anyone?).&nbsp; If you are really worried about being tracked, even at a bar, maybe try changing up your MAC address even time you go?&nbsp; Anyone else think this might help?
