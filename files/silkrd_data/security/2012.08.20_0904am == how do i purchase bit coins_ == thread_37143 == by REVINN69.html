				I&#039;m no expert by a long way and I&#039;m sure some other guys will be on to explain it better, but basically it all depends on your location and how discreet about it you want to be..<br /><br />I&#039;m in the UK and have used two different ways, firstly using a vendor on SR to convert a ukash voucher, secondly using a company called intersango where it&#039;s as simple as doing an online money transfer...<br /><br />The first being more expensive due to commission but having the benefit of been pretty much untraceable.<br /><br />Intersango are a pain in the ass, simple in theory but they seem to be having problems fairly regular which leaves you with your money floating around in the air..<br /><br />Mtgox is probably the most popular but I have never used them..<br /><br />I&#039;m sure some more experienced guys will be on to guide you a little more but as I already said, it&#039;s all about where you are how much you want to hide..<br /><br />I believe there&#039;s a guy here that does cash in the mail service, I forget his name, begins with a V, not sure what his rates are but that&#039;s about as discreet as you can get, I&#039;m pretty sure he&#039;s UK so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s an option if you&#039;re else where..<br /><br />Good luck, it can be daunting to start with, I did a dummy run with my first time using intersango with a small amount of money incase it went wrong... It&#039;s not as hard as first appears though...!!!

				Not sure what country your in but there are heaps of options ! Spend a little more time researching before jumping straight in. <br />Stuff like pgp, how to deal with vendors the right way and how your account works. Im only new-ish myself so I cant really help you, but the information your looking for can easily found on this forum and your vendor will appreciate it :)

				I use bitcoin central and its the most simple and fast way I found so far, dont need to give them any ID <br />You register, make a bank transfer, wait a few days for the money to arrive, then exchange it for other people&#039;s bitcoins. You can then transfer them to your SR account or through wallets/other sites if you want.

				If you live in the US search bitinstant on Google.&nbsp; Very easy, you just take cash to your local Walmart, CVS, Bank, etc and if you use your SR Bitcoin address it will go straight from cash to SR in about an hour. ;-)

				I&#039;m going to assume you are in the USA.&nbsp; Here is how I fund my account.&nbsp; This is just how I do it and I find it easy and within my comfort zone of anonymity.&nbsp; No ID needed and I give a fake name, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;m on camera in the CVS.<br /><br />Create a MtGox.com account<br />When logged in to MtGox, select funding options under the Buy &amp; Sell along the left side.<br />This will take you to the Add Funds page<br />At the &#039;Choose Funding Options&#039; pick BitInstant<br />Write down your Exchange Account and follow link to BitInstant<br />At BitInstant.com, choose CVS (or 7-11 or Walmart, etc.) the Pay From drop down box<br />Leave the Pay To box as Mt. Gox (unless you have another BTC wallet)<br />Be doubly sure you put the correct Exchange Account<br />Enter the amount you would like to send<br />Push send and you will be taken to the ZipZap website<br />At the bottom of the page, choose Create Payment Slip (the Payment Slip is a bill that can be paid at any MoneyGram location)<br /><br />Go to CVS<br />Pick up the red phone.<br />Enter invoice info from my Payment Slip.<br />Had some trouble entering the amount.&nbsp; Enter the whole dollars, then push *, then cents, then push #.<br />Gave them a fake name, address and phone number.<br />Go to the CVS counter and tell them you need to pay an overdue bill today.<br />Clerk will ask you if you are Mr. Dimmydummydummerdorf.&nbsp; Say yes.<br />If the clerk asks for a CVS rewards card, decline<br />Give her the cash - have exact change ready.<br />Sign the receipt - scribble it.<br />Given a receipt.<br /><br />By the time I get back to my office, a Bitinstant email is usually waiting.&nbsp; It shows up in my Mt. Gox account within a few hours.<br /><br />I like the fact that the printout says it is a bill payment.&nbsp; The lady at CVS didn&#039;t bat an eye.&nbsp; She seemed familiar with ZipZap, so maybe people use it regularly for bill payments.<br /><br />Any moneygram location will do, so I can mix it up.

				I&#039;d also recommend bit instant if you&#039;re in the US. I&#039;ve used moneypak -&gt; bitcoin exchanges on SR and I&#039;ve never had a problem, but by doing that you run the risk of being scammed and paying high exchange fees.
