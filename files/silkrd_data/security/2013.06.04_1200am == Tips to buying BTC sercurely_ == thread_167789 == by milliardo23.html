				How many wallets should you transfer your BTC before sending it to your SR account? And how often should you keep changing your btc wallet account?<br /><br />I got a seller that sells to me personally in very low amounts but I don&#039;t know if I should keep making new wallets or new accounts from different sites. <br /><br />Should I use tor to sign up for other wallets?

				I think what you are more looking for, is the laundering aspect. Bitcoin Fog is frequently noted for this ability. http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ however know that while it is a deterrent, its not 100% safe. But, that goes for everything. ** Edit: Just note, you do ultimately have to implicitly trust that whatever you put into bitcoin fog, you will get back out. I don&#039;t like to risk an opportunity for a large loss, but take that however you&#039;d like to.<br /><br />Changing wallets frequently can help, but I don&#039;t honestly suggest using online wallets. You get far more security from just running your own wallet, and you get the added benefit that you don&#039;t have to worry about a company going under and losing your funds either in limbo or to seizures by the US or otherwise.<br /><br />I use bitcoins for more than just SR, and I change my SR BTC address any and every time I add to it. Any time I go from outside SR, I use Fog. I buy BTC through bitcoininstant, using cash. Depending on the amount you purchase, since it goes through moneygram (or similar, depending on where you choose to go), you don&#039;t have to provide ID. This means you can use any name you want, so long as the name matches the name that you put into bitinstant. There gets a point where I feel complexity breeds opportunity for mistakes, and I prefer to try and be as close to the background noise as possible, so thats generally the limit to what I do.<br /><br />At least for the time being, BTC doesn&#039;t seem to be monitored as closely as say, bank accounts and credit card accounts. This is changing though, especially in the exchanges. As the US works to catch up to technology and limit our freedoms more, they are targeting ways that they see as methods for tax evasion. The more you exist in a system that can be monitored, the more the opportunity exists for you to BE monitored. BTC doesn&#039;t actually require you to USE an exchange, except if you then need to convert it into cash. In that area, I really can&#039;t give any advice, as for the moment I don&#039;t operate any businesses in BTC.
