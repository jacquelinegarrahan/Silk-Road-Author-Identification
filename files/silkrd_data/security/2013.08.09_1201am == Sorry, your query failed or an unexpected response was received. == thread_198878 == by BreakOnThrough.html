				Yeah I&#039;m a bit worried with all the security issues going on recently... I&#039;ve had the latest update for quite a while I&#039;m sure.<br />The Vidalia control panel still says &quot;connected to the tor network&quot;.<br /><br />Anyone more knowledgeable have any ideas?

				https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looks fine to me.<br /><br />When you updated, did you unpack in a different location?... or just overlay your old version?&nbsp; If the latter, that can cause problems.

				Same message here when launching TOR bundle.&nbsp; Onion icon states connected to TOR network, and allows connection to SR. However, I am concerned with the error.&nbsp; Anyone&nbsp; have insight, please let us know, this is a big concern.

				I updated this am (again), I was already up to date, but installed again anyway.&nbsp; I got in the am (after installation) without the message.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s related, since other people are receiving, and I got in w/o error this am.&nbsp; Is Astor around to answer this one??

				Oh... that &quot;home page&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Note the last line....<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Tor Check Outage on 03 and 04 July 2013<br /><br />Over the past 24 hours https://check.torproject.org has been unavailable due to excessive DNS queries to the exitlist service. It seems there are a number of individuals and companies with commercial products relying upon this volunteer service. We finally hit the point where we couldn&#039;t keep up with the queries and simply disabled the service.<br /><br />This is a volunteer service offered as a proof of concept. We strongly encourage people to run their own. The code is available at https://svn.torproject.org/svn/check/trunk/.<br /><br />The new Tor Browser 3.0 alpha series includes a new way to detect &quot;tor or not&quot; locally, without relying on a single point of failure service. This is the first step towards finally retiring check.torproject.org for good.<br /><br />As of 09:00 on 04 July 2013, the service is re-enabled. We reserve the right to take it down as needed without notice.<br />&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-check-outage-03-and-04-july-2013
