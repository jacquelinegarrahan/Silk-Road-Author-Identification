				It&#039;s a little bit more problematic than you&#039;re thinking it is... I mean it&#039;s entirely possible, but it&#039;s not like &quot;sure, somebody will have that out to you this afternoon!&quot;&nbsp; Just use APG to encrypt messages and email them back and forth, possibly as attachments so you don&#039;t have to cut &amp; paste I suppose.&nbsp; Not all that familiar with the app, but there has to be a PGP encryption app for iOS too.&nbsp; I have no clue what it is, but it&#039;s got to be out there.

				For ios there are a couple of apps: secumail, ipgmail?( I think) and oPenGP which is the one I have used. It works fine, but if you have a jail broken iPhone then Cydia comes with GPG. You use it from the command line (Mobile Terminal) in combination with iFile. I wrote a tutorial for it a while back. When I get chance I&#039;ll trawl back through my posts; unless someone cares enough to beat me to it. It&#039;s basically same as Linux command line GPG, but since copy/ paste doesn&#039;t work great in Mobile Terminal it&#039;s best to use it to encrypt .txt or .asc files using -a in the command ( this will output an encrypted.asc file rather than a .gpg file, which you can copy paste from.)<br />It sounds a bit complicated, but once you get set up with all the commands as shortcuts in Terminal, and a blank .asc file to copy paste to, it works pretty well and is more versatile than the GUI versions above

				2048 bits is generally considered the minimum size RSA key (assuming you want basically &quot;guaranteed&quot; security, not a &quot;good enough&quot; security).&nbsp; My key is 4096 bits, and the minimum ciphertext using it (encrypting the letter &quot;a&quot;) is 905 ASCII-armored characters.<br /><br />That&#039;s 6 text messages.&nbsp; Again, it&#039;s not impossible or undoable... but the question is why does it absolutely need to be done via SMS?

				Had a look at this app. It looks good but can someone explain it to me like I am a child. <br />It says it advises installing k9 email as well. So I installed k9.<br /><br />I generated a secret key on the app, but I am finding it difficult to &quot;export&quot; a public key, and it only seems to give me the option to export my &quot;secret key&quot;.<br /><br />With k9 supposedy if its set up right, you can automatically send and receive emails which will encrypt and decrypt. Has anyone got it running smooth? Thanks.

				i&#039;ve heard a lot of warnings and cautions against using IOS devices for anything SR related<br /><br />is this because of having your identity so closely tied with the device? <br />I&#039;m sure apple is a corp. that would cooperate with LE on anything if they haven&#039;t already<br /><br />if the iphone is unlocked/jailbroken and paid for thru an anonymous method does this make it potentially securable?

				I have also heard these warnings and every time they come up I ask for the details of why using an IOS device to access Tor network,&nbsp; or using GPG to encrypt messages sent over Tor from iOS. I hear a lot of &quot;Personally I wouldn&#039;t trust a smart phone &quot; but I&#039;d like to know the specific risks so I can decide for myself. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have used Onion browser in the past, with Tor bridges and user agent spoofing so I appear to be using windows 7. How is my identity being leaked? At which point in the chain? Please understand I am not casting doubts on people better informed than me, but whenever this question comes up there is a lot of muttering into beards but no solid facts. There has been suggestions that malicious code may be pushed to my device, but I have changed my root password and disabled OTA software updates. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or is it suspected that the Onion browser project and oPenGP might have backdoors, either deliberate or accidental?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I understand about it being a bad idea to, say, burgle a house while carrying a mobile phone as your location in the area can be confirmed. But this seems to me not really to apply to using it to access Tor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just to add, I order rarely from SR and only small amounts, and so obviously I am less concerned about what an adversary with large resources could do against me; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess another risk is that if one of my small packages were intercepted and my device seized, it isn&#039;t encrypted in the same way a PC can be. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;d just like one of the security gurus to step in here and advise me of the details of the vulnerabilities here. <br />I have also heard about phone microphones being remotely activated . Again, I don&#039;t really see this as a concern in this instance. <br />I guess the core of what I&#039;m asking is in what way is using Tor from a phone more risky than using it from your home IP, which I&#039;m sure many of us do? Can my communications be intercepted between my device and the cell tower? But surely I would have to be under scrutiny already?<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t trust any device that is FCC-compliant, GPS-capable, and closed-source with built-in data transmission whose functionality is controlled by a wireless manufacturer. Maybe I&#039;m a little on the paranoid side. <br /><br />Tor and PGP are only as secure as the machine you&#039;re using it on. If it&#039;s a 1-piece unit built and controlled by somebody else, they could easily have direct access to exactly what is shown on the screen and which connection requests the user is making.

				My thinking is that if you use a phone you are better off with Android than an I phone. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t think it was possible to do truly secure pgp encryption on phones and tablets yet.<br /><br />It is just so easy to hack a cell phone I didn&#039;t think it was a good idea to use it for SR business ( not just looking around ).
