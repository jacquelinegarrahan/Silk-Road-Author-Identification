				How do you configure a vpn service to work with tor?&nbsp; I have the vpn service installed and the icon is green and says its connected but when I check my ip through my normal browser and not tor it has my real ip. So if its not even changing my ip on the clearnet then its not working with tor obviously.&nbsp; Im a little confused on how to set it up.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Do you want to run Tor over your VPN? Or VPN over Tor?<br /><br />Running Tor over VPN requires that you configure your VPN to use UDP. Otherwise Tor will be shit slow because Tor prefers to be tunneled over UDP.<br /><br />Running VPN over Tor is just the opposite. Tor will only tunnel TCP traffic over it. If you don&#039;t configure your VPN to use TCP when tunneling its traffic over your Tor proxy, it won&#039;t work at all.<br /><br />If you trust your VPN (private is top notch) and you&#039;ve paid for their service with bitcoins then Tor over VPN is best and most versatile. This also has the effect of hiding all of your traffic from your local service provider. If you don&#039;t trust your VPN provider then run their service over Tor. It all depends on who you will allow to know your real IP.

				I am in the sam situation...using the same vpn provider as well.<br /><br />Which is better? Tor over VPN or vice versa? and which is each doing?<br /><br />Sorry to hijack the thread...but I would be so grateful if someone could help and I think the information can be beneficial to both parties.<br /><br />Also, I have just connected to the vpn, then Tor. I have not configured anything other than tcp.

				I hope you realize people don&#039;t need to trace you through Tor if you tell them the VPN you enter into Tor from

				I got the vpn service to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;I paid with bitcoin and used a tormail account to set it up.&nbsp; That&#039;s all of the info they have and they say they do not keep any records.&nbsp; I was going to open the vpn service which now is working and has changed my ip and then use tor on that.&nbsp; Is that wrong or do I do to do additional steps in order for it to work?&nbsp; What are the same guidelines to follow on vpns.&nbsp; Should I never access personal information on a VPN like facebook email accounts?&nbsp; Is it not good to track a package through a vpn?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always went down to a open wifi cafe or something to check tracking for packages.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also UDP is enabled.&nbsp; Since my ip is changed on clearnet, and im on tor.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t everything be working?&nbsp; It&#039;s not slow and havent had any issues connecting on tor.&nbsp; As you can tell im a noob with all this stuff.&nbsp; I rather not have my isp see me connecting to tor.

				What I normally do is connect to the internet through my normal ISP... Thats normal. <br /><br />Your only connected to the Net at this point.. Now before i go open a browser. I go to my program i have downloaded that MASKS your IP, To make sure its been really masked iv even gone went to my browser, then went to one of the sites that will tell your IP address on the site..<br /><br />Long as i MASSK my IP, it always shows my fake on when i check to see where it shows me at and whats the IP address to make sure it is in effect, i then go jump on TOR, where again im giving another IP for the tor browser, so im behind 2 fakes when im on the net..<br /><br />If anyone see;s any errors or whole in what i do let me know

				if you click &quot;Modify&quot; on your first post, you should see at the top where it normally says &quot;Subject&quot;, it should say &quot;Thread Title&quot;, or even if it says &quot;subject&quot; it changes your thread title lol.<br /><br />
