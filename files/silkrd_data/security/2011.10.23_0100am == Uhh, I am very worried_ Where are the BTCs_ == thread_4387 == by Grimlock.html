				Well I placed an order with get-bitcoin.com yesterday (more than 24 hours), and they said they sent the BTCs I ordered to my wallet. I am assuming this wallet is obviously the one on the Bitcoin client/program on my computer, so I gave them my address (that I newly generated specifically for this transaction). <br /><br />It never got here. I searched my hash code they gave me in the bitexplorer, search pretty much everything I know. But nothing. I don&#039;t even see anything coming into my bitcoin program. Is there somewhere else I should be looking? <br /><br />I contacted get-bitcoins.com, and they said that they withdrew the BTC from their Mt. Gox account (oh god) and sent me the funds. They even sent me a picture of the transaction taking place, being sent to my address. <br /><br />I waited until I downloaded all the blocks: nothing. I waited until I had more than 40~ connections: nothing. <br /><br />What do I do? <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				I&#039;m bumping this for you, because I have a similar problem (I think) as well. My order was through Mt. Gox, took them 2 days to get straight and now have been waiting over a day to see the BTC&#039;s in my bitcoin wallet. Nothing yet....<br /><br />I&#039;m a newbie and maybe missing something, but I have done everything to the letter of what I&#039;ve been told to do and nothing. I really don&#039;t know what to think/expect.

				Yea, it&#039;s pissing me off, especially because they should have been transferred to me yesterday. I was going to order a couple of things, but that doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s happening...

				Transferred BTC funds from Canadian Virtual Exchange to my SR account.<br /><br />It took around an hour and a half.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not bad.<br /><br />The same happened in my previous transactions last month.

				I ordered from get-bitcoins and they were in my wallet in less than an hour...have you checked that the blocks are increasing on your wallet software?&nbsp; I have heard of some people&#039;s wallets getting stuck on a block and they have to manually update the blocks to get their coins.
