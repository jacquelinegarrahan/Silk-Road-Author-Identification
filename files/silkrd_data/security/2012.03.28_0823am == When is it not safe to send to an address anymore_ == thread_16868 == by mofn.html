				I&#039;ve been using an address to send my packages from NL -&gt; US now, and so far only one vendor has succeeded in this. (Twice). The other two vendors recently had problems getting their package to me.<br /><br />My question is, do you think I should move on to another address? I don&#039;t actually have that many places to send it to... The vendor I want to buy from that is in NL now has a 100% ship rate to the USA and is going strong, but I&#039;m worried my next order might not come if my address is flagged. My next order is quite a bigger one (&gt;$500), and I would prefer to get it.<br /><br />Just want to emphasize that the two vendors I ordered from that I never received were having shipping issues and other people had the same complaint.<br /><br />Should I go open a PO box or something?

				Two haven&#039;t made it through? I&#039;d rather not risk third time lucky.<br /><br />One you can explain away (maybe). Two? Maybe bad luck, but why risk it if you don&#039;t have to, and let&#039;s face it, no one has to.

				What is the chronology of this?<br />If you had two deliveries followed by two failures then I would give up on that address.<br />If you let us know when the deliveries/failures happened it will help.

				From what I have been reading DQB might have a less than perfect rep for actually sending stuff, this is just conjecture as I have never ordered from him and is just based on stuff I have read on the forums.<br />With that in mind then you may just have a late delivery from CB, if you have had no letters from customs I would not worry too much mate.

Yeah I really hope CB&#039;s package is late, I would prefer to receive it than to get a refund. I also read about DQB&#039;s rep, but I also hear that customs might not send love letters anymore?
