Secrecy and anonymity have always played roles in the movement of money, most commonly because they offer a strong measure of privacy and protection against being targeted by thieves, but also because the parties in financial transactions can have other reasons—some legitimate, some not—for keeping a low profile.<br /><br />The combination of the enormous growth in social networks, the complexity of peer-to-peer systems and software, and the number of Internet and wirelessly connected devices is altering the landscape of financial transactions at a rate and to a degree that is unprecedented. Today, such transactions can be conducted not only using traditional, state-backed currencies, but also through purely digital currencies, virtual currencies, and virtual goods. In addition, mobile phone-based money transfer systems enabling traditional currencies to be moved in novel ways are experiencing rapid adoption, particularly in developing nations.<br /><br />Almost no one would argue that governments do not have a right to track and trace digital financial transactions associated with activities such as terrorism and human trafficking. It is less clear, however, how governments can surmount the formidable technical and organizational challenges associated with detecting and monitoring these transactions. The solution will require a combination of self-regulation, government-industry collaboration, and change in both technology and culture within government agencies.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />also, another journal mention in this article (this came up on journal watch as well)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the use of encrypted identities in Bitcoin has spurred the creation of an online market that accepts payments only in Bitcoins and links anonymous drug buyers with anonymous drug sellers.12 As Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated in a June 2011 letter sent to Attorney General Eric Holder and Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Michele Leonhart, “after purchasing Bitcoins through an exchange, a user can create an account on Silk Road and start purchasing illegal drugs from individuals around the world and have them delivered to their homes within days.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
