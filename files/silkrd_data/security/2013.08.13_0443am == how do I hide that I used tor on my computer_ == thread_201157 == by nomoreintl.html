				Do you mean you need to erase any Tor related files on your computer, or that you want to hide all Tor web traffic?<br /><br />If you want to erase Tor related files, use the program Eraser to delete your Tor Browser folder. You can find it here (CLEARNET): http://eraser.heidi.ie/<br /><br />If you want to hide Tor web traffic, use a VPN.

				The only way to erase all evidence of the browser bundle is to write random data over the entire hard drive.<br /><br />Here are the traces that TBB leaves behind on Windows after you delete the folders it was extracted to:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.msg1152452#msg1152452<br /><br />That&#039;s what we know about based on one analysis. There may be other traces on other setups.<br /><br />Check if your hard drive has the ATA Secure Erase feature and use that to perform a full disk wipe. If it doesn&#039;t have that feature, download DBAN and use that to perform at least one random write over the whole drive.<br /><br />Then reinstall Windows. It will still be obvious that you reinstalled Windows.<br />

				using sandboxie to run the browser bundle should effectively keep it from changing data on your system.

				I&#039;m going to go with astor on this one. Unless your hard drive is securely encrypted, the only way to hide tor use from a sophisticated attacker is to wipe the entire drive via software such as DBAN, or the ATA secure erase command if your hard drive supports it--see the drive manufacturer&#039;s website, they should have diagnostic toolkits available for download that will allow you to initiate a secure wipe.<br /><br />Most any OS, and especially Windows, leaves behind way too many artifacts for a simple &quot;evidence cleaner&quot; type program to get rid of. If your freedom is possibly at stake, just wipe the whole drive and call it a day.
