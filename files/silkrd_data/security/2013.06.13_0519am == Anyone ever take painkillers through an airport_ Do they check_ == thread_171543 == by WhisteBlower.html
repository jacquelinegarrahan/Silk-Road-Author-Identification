				Anyone ever travelled through an airport and lets say, had oxies on them? If I were to put them in a bottle of a LEGITIMATE percocet prescription, would that be a problem? Or is it smarter to put them in a bottle of tylenol or herbal supplements and just check that into checked luggage?<br /><br />Any insight on this? Does TSA scrutinize pills/medications/read the prescription bottle labels? <br /><br />I know checking them in is the foolproof way to go, but taking them on the plane in your carry on (next to contact solution, shaving cream, deoderant etc.. just in a bottle labeled Percocet or some other medication).. any safe?

				I think that you will be fine if they are in a medical bag with all other pills and stuff around, I think the worst case scenarios is that they get confiscated, provided you do not look like a mob lord with 300 OC in a baggie on you.

				Odd enough, you are NOT required to have medication/pills labeled by the TSA. Yes, you read that right. <br /><br />Source, TSA website. *CLEARNET WARNING* http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/what-expect-if-passenger-needs-medication<br /><br />And the TSA Travel Blog *CLEARNET WARNING*&nbsp; http://blog.tsa.gov/2011/08/traveling-with-medication.html<br /><br />So no, you can take your pills with you. Put them in your percocet bottle. Or put them in vitamins. Who knows. TSA is the Trave SAFETY Administration. As long as your not posing a safety risk to the airport/airline/passengers/.. they do not care what &quot;medications&quot; you bring and how. <br /><br />Other drugs, OTH such as coke and weed and heroin and other things that dogs can sniff out. Thats a crapshoot. Most dogs in airports are for bombs, not drugs.<br />Although, who knows.

				As long as you&#039;re not muling a kilo of the things you&#039;ll be fine. Just follow what most people do and stuff them in in with your aspirin and travel toothpaste and Emergen-C!&nbsp; I&#039;ve never once had TSA look at any of my prescription pills or supplements. Airport security cares more about explosives and biohazards material than drugs. <br /><br />Also, in some ways carry-on makes more sense than checking, especially if it&#039;s a long flight. Nearly half of all US citizens are on some form of prescription medication, and it&#039;s not unusual that people need to fly with theirs. If you&#039;re really worried about not having a prescription just buy one of those weekly pill organizers and divide them up that way (along with a few other vitamins and such): it&#039;s a nice excuse for not having the bottle on you and will look as though you&#039;re using them to manage an unpleasant health condition.

				Just put them in a prescription pill bottle and you&#039;ll be fine. They never check. If you&#039;re really worried about it, you can forge a prescription label so it looks like they&#039;re legit ;D

				I take benzos and legit painkillers all the time with me on my carry-on. Haven&#039;t had issues yet.

				I have flown internationally with unmarked prescription painkillers mixed in a bag with other pills and vitamins. Neither the TSA or their foreign equivalents ever noticed or cared.

				Same here. I was all freaked out and it was nothing.<br />Now if you make the special screening I can&#039;t say.

				many people i know and myself have never had a problem with security taking benzos and painkillers<br />i always take as little as possible to be comfortable. personally i wouldnt try to get 500 pills through<br />usually i just take all my pills and put them in 1 bottle and i like to throw a bunch of vitamins and herbal pills in there too just so its a mix. hopefully they get camouflaged a bit. i dont put them in the bottom of a pill bottle cuz i think if it was looked at it would stick out if they found pills hidden in the bottom of a tylenol bottle. i think it looks better all mixed together<br />i have taken methadone all over the place<br />

				Just to reiterate what others have said, with just a little bit of effort you have nothing to worry about! Just don&#039;t store them loose, in baggies, or something sketchy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve flown domestically many times with ALL sorts of pills in carry-on and it has never piqued even the slightest attention. I know others who have done the same. I think it&#039;s probably pretty common for people to put all of their pills into one container while traveling. Just think about how many people pop a Xanax at takeoff alone. Shit, you would probably get in trouble for trying to carry-on too many RX bottles.<br /><br />I just pick one RX bottle with a label in my name to use, then put everything in there. I&#039;ve also taken sizeable amounts of illicit powders concealed in bodybuilding supplement bottles (there are all sorts of obscure bulk powders) or other containers. Just make sure that it&#039;s not something a dog would ever detect.

				Is it better to put them in a pill bottle that HAS my name? But it is it a different med? Say, putting them in a legit script of ambien or flexeral? (because at that time u r techincally misrepresenting what the bottle states). But then again the tsa is not concerned with anything other then plane safety.<br />Or mixing a bunch of pills and advills and vitamins in 1 bottle?<br /><br />or am I jsut overthinking it? I also would assume that those pill containers/boxes that contain a 7 day slot (for people who take legit meds daily) should be good enough as well as elderly people probably never fly with doznes of RX bottles.. would just be too damn bulky.<br /><br />I havent flown in a couple years.. I know liquids and tootpastes etc must be put in that clear baggie.. but r u required to remove medications from ur shaving kit and place them seperately? or can just send the backpack thru?<br /><br />sorry 4 all the questions. been a nerve racking last few weeks and running on 0 sleep.
