				I have been on the Road for over a year now and have never had any problems with deliveries. <br />Today I picked up a package of pills from a very reputable vendor with whom I&#039;ve done many successful transactions. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;m giving away too much by saying it&#039;s usually a priority envelope with a smaller package inside wrapped in bubble wrap.<br /><br />When I picked up the envelope I noticed it had been opened (not cut with knife, but opened at the usual pull strip), and resealed with packing tape. Inside I found the smaller package without its usual bubble wrap and completely unsealed (usually the inner package is well sealed). <br /><br />The meds I ordered were inside and appeared normal and work just fine. <br /><br />I contacted the vendor who was very quick to respond. We discussed everything and he said he did NOT send the stuff in this condition.<br /><br />I keep a clean house and for peace of mind I will definitely switch to a new mailbox center, however can anyone advise if this has happened to you. <br /><br />Also, any guesses about what might have happened? I have read posts by someone who sounds very authoritative stating that LE (at least Postal LE) opens suspicious packages very carefully and reseals them carefully to avoid tipping off the suspect. <br /><br />The vendor suspects it may be a nosy/thieving postal or mailbox employee. The guy who works there is a young punk kid. He always looks at me suspiciously (that&#039;s when he&#039;s not fucking around on the internet) and acts like it&#039;s a hassle to pull out my packages. <br /><br />Any thoughts much appreciated. Like I said, I am a long-time buyer and have never had a problem thus far.

				#1: i think ur giving away to much info about the shipping and should edit your post.<br /><br />#2: i think what happend to ur package was .. maybe it WAS opened by the post office .. <br />but they saw it was a pathetic ammount and didnt want to alert the feds for a warrent about it..<br /><br />#3: you should never get anything shipped in that name or that place.<br /><br />#4: relax there is nothing they can do now ur safe for now but u are prolly being watched now that punk kid will prolly be waiting for a bigger shipment to come<br />and will take it and say it was lost in the mail... lol either way chill out ur alright now they would not let u have the package normally they switch it out with fakes then raid u
