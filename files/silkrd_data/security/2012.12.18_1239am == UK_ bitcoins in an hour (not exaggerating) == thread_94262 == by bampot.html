				I&#039;m in two minds about writing this, as I don&#039;t want this guy to go anywhere (damn banks closed his account for too many transactions, but he&#039;s back with a better system).&nbsp; I&#039;m posting this as a favour: I told him I could get him a lot more customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Believe me - you will not get service like this anywhere else, I guarantee.&nbsp; He adds 4% commission or so to Mt Gox rates, but you can transfer money any time of day and have your coins within the hour.&nbsp; Those of you in the UK will think this sounds too good to be true!&nbsp; trust me, it isn&#039;t.<br /><br />Anyway, his email is: bitcoinfridge at gmail dot com.&nbsp; He says that if it&#039;s a one-off then he won&#039;t ask for verification; but if you&#039;re buying regularly then you might need to give ID or something (don&#039;t know what this involves).<br /><br />Please do not mention anything about silk road, or even where you got the source... he hasn&#039;t mentioned it, and I would imagine he probably wouldn&#039;t trade with people who stated that that was their purpose.&nbsp; Just ask for a quote; he&#039;ll give you payment details and get your bitcoin address.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS - If you are as grateful as I was, then I&#039;ll happily accept donations for the tip! Same username ;-)<br /><br />

				Hmm required ID? No thanks.<br /><br />The best service I have used so far has got to be BTCxUK - http://64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion/<br /><br />I deposited my money at a local bank branch at 3:30, had the bitcoins sent to me within 2 hours.

I wouldn&#039;t trust this guy, if he&#039;s had his bank account shut down once for doing too many transactions, he&#039;s not planning properly, there&#039;s a chance it might happen again. Here&#039;s his website (clearwebalert)&nbsp; http://bitcoinfridge.co.uk , there is also a thread on bitcointalk (clearwebalert) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118396.0 and this post explains why he needs id (clearwebalert) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118396.msg1359585#msg1359585. I wouldn&#039;t do it, stay safe everyone, nobody as ever asked me for my ID for a bitcoin transaction if they did they&#039;d never hear from me again, there&#039;s much more anonymous ways to obtain bitcoins than this.
