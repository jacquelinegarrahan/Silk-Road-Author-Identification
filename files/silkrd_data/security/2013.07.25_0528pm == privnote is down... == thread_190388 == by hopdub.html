				I don&#039;t use privnote, but I know a lot of people do. If LE ever subpoenaed them for their data, they would be able to flag quite a bit of addresses. I don&#039;t really think they would or even could without solid cause. I realize many people use it for other things and business addresses and what not, but still....kinda makes you wonder.<br /><br />Learn PGP people. There is no reason to give your address to a third party. You might as well just send it through SR.

				I was about to start a new thread on the same subject, here&#039;s the post I wrote:<br /><br />At the moment privnote.com seems to be down, and buyers are likely to turn to other sites offering the same service.<br /><br />If one of those &quot;new&quot; services turns out to be a LE honeypot, any vendor that visits the honeypot to retrieve a delivery address without using Tor (or similar) would be trivial for LE to track down. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure others have pointed out the risks associated with using privnote.com, but now that buyers might start using a multitude of unfamiliar but similar sites I think the opportunity for LE to launch a dragnet honeypot attack is big enough to start a separate thread.<br /><br />Vendors: Do you accept these services as a valid way for buyers to give their addresses? Are you sure you are following best practice when opening those links?

				I am glad it is down.<br /><br />PGP is easy to learn, but using privnote instead makes things worse not better. Pleased just send as plain text if you cannot figure PGP. The only thing that privnote accomplishes is sharing the information with privnote.<br /><br />If you use PGP then only the vendor can read it.<br /><br />If you send plain text then only Silk Road and the vendor can read it.<br /><br />If you send by privnote then privnote, Silk Road and the vendor can read it.<br /><br />Privnote saves information and surrenders it to law enforcement on request.<br />

				I have never seen privnote down so that would worry me a little bit if you ever have used privnote before...maybe they could get a subpoena and sift through all the &quot;destroyed&quot; notes and random addresses.&nbsp; Even if the code is written to destroy the notes, the data must be saved somewhere or is at least retrievable by someone with technical skills.

				I am in agreement with you all. I think that if a vendor really cares or the privacy of thir buyers then they would make it a requirement to order from them. PGP is dam good privacy. I read somewhere that it took a government operative all of 6 months to hack into one PGP encrypted message

The javascript on Privnote encrypts the contents *before* (client-side) sending them off to the server. This means that if there is no javascript for encrypting client-side, you are sending plaintext to the third party and *hoping* that they encrypt it for you and throw away the key.<br /><br />Just use PGP.

This is the same HashedNoteID used when generating the note, since the NoteID used to make the hash is the same in both cases<br />The server retrieves the note from the database using HashedNoteID as the database primary key and decrypts its contents using NoteID as the encryption key<br /><br />3.The server shows the page with the decrypted note<br /><br />4.The server permanently deletes the note from the database, keeping only a record of the HashedNoteID, the time when it was read, and the IP address where it was read from, to show it when someone tries to see the note again<br /><br /><br />If someone with access to the database would like to read the note she would be unable because she doesn&#039;t have the key to decrypt it (NoteID), only the database primary key (HashedNoteID). The HashedNoteID cannot be used to &quot;go back&quot; to the NoteID because hashes are &quot;one-way&quot;. So the only person who can actually decrypt (and thus see) the note is the one who has the original NoteID or, in other words, the one who has the link to the note.<br /><br /><br />These are facts people.
