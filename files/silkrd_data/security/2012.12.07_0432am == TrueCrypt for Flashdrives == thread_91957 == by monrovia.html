				Ive been trying to read a little more on the security forum lately. I&#039;ve finally got myself a flash drive with a substantial capacity. I&#039;m wondering how secure you guys feel using truecrypt ALONE to encrypt my SR stuff on the flash drive. I tried using liberte but was having some problems. I&#039;m still going to de a bit more research and maybe try some other methods/approaches, but for the time being, how safe am I at the moment with just truecrypt?

				I use a tiny 4gb SD microcard stick to encrypt my SR acct data and bitcoin shit. I feel damn good using it in my opinion as its better than using nothing, easy to dispose of, and sure as hell better than keeping sensitive data on your HD.
