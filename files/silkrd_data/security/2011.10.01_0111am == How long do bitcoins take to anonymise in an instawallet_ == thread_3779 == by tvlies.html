				I believe that I read in a thread on here that it was around 6 hours.<br /><br />Also I bought some bitcoins from MtGox using my Debit card (had to use MtGox because it was the only one that I could see that accepted GBP) and plan to launder them through 4 stages of instawallets in varying amounts. After the 1st wallet I will be using Tor to access them. Will that be enough?

				Yes that will most likely be more than enough. It doesn&#039;t necessarily take 6 hours. It can be far less. After 1 hour just go to &#039;blockexplorer&#039; ( &lt;--- google it), and tap your btc wallet address into the search. If you can see that all the BTC has been sent out (and new coins come in), then its had a stage 1 wash. Now send to new wallet. (only do this twice, 4 times seem overkill).<br /><br />Just be aware that instawallet may keep http logs, to you might want to reset tor exit node between wallets. I think there will be more free wallets than instawallet soon, so it will be best to pass between at least 2.... insta + 1 other.

				So, after that, would it be safe enough to trade the &quot;clean&quot; coins for MoneyPaks and reload a Visa debit card with it ? Would it be safe to cash out at Bank of America with those coins ? Thanks ..<br /><br />TFM

				&#039;Safe&#039; is but a vaporous mirage in these here parts&nbsp; :o but in all likelihood its safe &#039;enough&#039;&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />So many variables to consider (such as are the new coins really &#039;clean&#039; [eg: not dirtier than the coins you already owned]), and also what techniques / attacks are adversaries (for lack of a better word) currently deploying (I&#039;d say *none* that would be of concern of you took the above precautions).... conjecture and speculation at the moment, but I think washed coins will not be the weakest link in the chain of accountability, and this precautionary measure is safe enough for the time being.

				Oh fuck!<br /><br />I sent money directly to SR at once about a month ago and still in the blockexplorer. Thinking to delete my wallet, ccleaner and reinstall the client.<br /><br />Is there someway to delete an address from your address book? I don&#039;t know how, but I used an address at once to receive 1 bitcoin and it&#039;s not listed in my addressbook anymore, but it is listed in the &quot;receive tab&quot;. I typed it manually in blockexplorer and the transaction for it address is cataloged.<br /><br />Another question: is there any advantage of using the proxy socks4 in the bitclient?
