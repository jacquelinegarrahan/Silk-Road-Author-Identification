				So I xferred bitcoins to my Silk Road address<br />14K5txMuPXM6kDC3W5ZTmg5qzGA6Z8n5qY <br />4+ hours ago.&nbsp; In blockchain.info and block explorer it shows the coins already in there and confirmed!&nbsp; This address is a year old so is it possible it&#039;s corrupt?&nbsp; I know Silk Road users can send me coins by my name but it looks like transferring to my address is not happening.&nbsp; This was $300 worth so if someone could help me I&#039;d be very grateful.

				E-Mail them with an anonymous email or something. I ran into a problem with my last BTC purchase. My dumbass forgot to set the right recipient on the website I used, so it got sent to MTGox instead of my BTC address. All I did was email them off of my tormail, and they straightened it out within a few hours.

				Thanks for the respones guys.<br /><br />So to be clear, I used bitinstant which sent BTC to an ewallet within an hour.&nbsp; After I got the BTC into my ewallet, I transferred to my SR address.<br /><br />The address is correct, blockchain says its in my SR address but SR doesn&#039;t see it.&nbsp; But thanks guys you&#039;re making me feel better, i guess it&#039;s just slow here on the road.

				As long as you didn&#039;t screw up the address I am sure it will be straightened out. I kinda remember reading about this issue in the past and the recommendation was to always get a new SR address before sending but I am sure you can and will still receive at the old one it just takes time must be a glitch somewhere.&nbsp; I would recommend that your posts on this matter go in a different category

				I&#039;m having the same problem. Blockchain is giving me tons of confirmations to the right address, but my SR account remains empty. This has happened to me once before, and everything got cleared up. If you&#039;re showing blockchain confirmations to an SR address associated with you, you&#039;ll be fine. DPR already mentioned that he was behind schedule on support, so I imagine this will get resolved as soon as he&#039;s able to get to it.<br /><br />Just remember: &quot;Serentity Now....&quot;

				I have also been having trouble getting bitcoins sent. And, just like you, I sent them to an old address (months old). Perhaps this is the common denominator here?<br /><br />I sent mine back on 10/20 and the coins still show up as &quot;this transaction is not yet confirmed&quot; in my bitcoin wallet. However, my coins have already been debited from my account.<br /><br />I sent a message to SR support this morning and have yet to hear back.<br /><br />Anyway, just letting you know you&#039;re not alone.

				I think that they should directly add, in the account page, before &quot;Please be patient, it may take a few hours for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction.&quot;, something like &quot;Get a new address before sending your Bitcoins to your SR wallet!&quot;<br /><br />This way (almost) nobody should have this problem in the first place.

				just send them to your silkroad btc address. people send them to mtgox and then a few others wallets to tumble the coin. tumbleing coins is met to avoid detection from the law but most people send them directly to there sr btc address....<br /><br />MAKE SURE YOU CLICK NEW ADDRESS FIRST SO IT DOESNT TAKE FOREVER.<br /><br />so bitinstant to btc address (btc addres being your sr wallet address.)
