				I only have the URL of bitcoinfog - http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion - there are more but I don&#039;t remember them. <br /><br />A few days ago there were many threads about it being not reachable, right now it looks fine for me, but perhaps do some research on the forums about the current state of bitcoinfog and if everything worked out for the people affected by the downtime.

I contacted the site admin and they actually respond, they&#039;re honest people (at least I assume they are because you never read about them stealing anyone&#039;s money). Anyway, they basically said it was a small server issue and it was nothing to worry about. It&#039;s the same thing when SR goes down, obviously it&#039;s an inconvenience for us just how it would be an inconvenience if gmail or amazon stopped working but these guys don&#039;t have the resources google/amazon have so you kinda have to cut them some slack&nbsp; ;)
