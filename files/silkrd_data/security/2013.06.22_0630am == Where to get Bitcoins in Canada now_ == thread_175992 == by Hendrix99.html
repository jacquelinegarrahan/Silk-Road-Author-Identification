				Just wondering how others get them here? It seems our options are limited, I only know of 2 websites to get them and as of today no more cash deposits . You must get verified and use bill payment!!.&nbsp; Ive read about this happining at mtgox and bitinstant or what ever they use in the US but I dont know anything about them as I dont think we can use those sites.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looks like there clamping down. Is there any other ways?

				sad to say, the best I can offer is &quot;I&#039;m working on it bro&quot;<br /><br />As for a solution at the moment to stock up on coins, I have no idea other than the exchanges already there which as you pointed out, have started claiming verification even though everything I read says that the government up there isn&#039;t pushing regulations like they are down here. <br /><br />Any ideas would be solid. If not.. well screw it, verification it is, and then fees.. fees up the ass.

				Hey guys,<br />Unfortunately the large exchanges have to adhere to the banks regs and the banks get them from the govt, obviously. So, although the govt regs may not be as strict in Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia aka Scotiabank has been cracking down on transfers to mtgox. I haven&#039;t heard of many more incidences with banks in Canada. Anyway, if you guys need coins for now, you can send me you pgp key via email and we can work a deal. I have some at my disposal and would b willing to send them to your for a nominal 8% fee. Hit me up or send me your key and we can talk. Oh, and yes, the obstacles and fees you pay to the exchanges are a bitch!

				Hendrix99.&nbsp; I have been using Virtex since they opened a year or two ago.&nbsp; Up until last Friday they accepted cash at several banks.&nbsp; Of course that was too good to last and the banks decided to stop accepting cash deposits to their accounts.<br /><br />They just posted their new method of doing cash deposits.&nbsp; You can make a bill payment to their payment provider via Money Mart or several banks.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried it yet at Money Mart so I don&#039;t know if they will ask for ID or if you can just give them a name and account number.&nbsp; But you do have to be &#039;Cash Verified&#039; to be able to do a cash deposit of more than $3000 a month, otherwise you can setup your account with any name you want.<br /><br />Even if you are verified it really isn&#039;t that big a deal unless you are dealing in very large transactions.&nbsp; Remember, it&#039;s not illegal to buy or sell BTC, so as long as your amounts aren&#039;t huge and you keep your trail clean (don&#039;t go transferring directly from your BTC provider to SR, move it around first between the provider&#039;s wallet and a couple of your own wallets or via another tumbling site) you are fine.<br /><br />First someone would have to bring you to LE&#039;s attention and provide them with your BTC providers account number, next they would have to have some reason for getting a warrant other than the fact you buy and sell BTC.&nbsp; They might try and talk to you and scare you into co-operating with them but they cannot do anything without a warrant and the chances of them even bothering with you are extremely low.<br /><br />I would be more concerned about keeping your main domicile clean and staying alert for any kind of CD than worry about your BTC transactions somehow leading them to you.&nbsp; They are more likely to look at your BTC transactions AFTER they have already caught you with something you shouldn&#039;t have than the other way around.&nbsp; So long as you have been doing your BTC in cash with a made up name and you erase your wallet and any presence of SR on your computer they would have nothing to trace back to you.

				I think the easiest way to procure coins is definitely via localbitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;You end up meeting the person craigslist style at a coffee shop,etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had success with transactions ranging from 1-10k.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Bare in mind I&#039;ve never used localbitcoins<br /><br />but to my understanding. You use the site to contact someone that is either buying or selling at a price that you can deal with. There are different methods of payment for the coins, it all depends on what you and the other person will accept. Because there isn&#039;t an escrow system, only a rating system (correct me if I&#039;m wrong I&#039;ve never heard of escrow with localbitcoins) it appears to me that most people like to meet up to make the exchange in person. This is why people meet up at starbucks. I imagine it goes something like a friendlier version of:<br />&quot;show me the money... alright cool, whats you&#039;re address? alright they are sent. lets get a coffee and wait for the blockchain whatever..&quot; 15 mins later &quot;cool there&#039;s the first verification. thanks for the cash. later&quot;<br /><br />again I&#039;ve never done this, but thats more or less how it seems to me. I imagine someone else can elaborate a lot more accurately. <br /><br />The down side is that you are meeting a stranger. I imagine this may become a target of street rips, muggings and the like. apart from that there is also the chance of meeting up with LE. I read a thread on here a little bit ago that was a story (true or false) about someone meeting to do a trade, after the trade both parties left like normal. The buyer (who was the one telling the story) was home when LE showed up at his door with a bunch of questions. afterwards he figured that the person he did the trade with was an undercover and they must have either tagged his plate or followed him to his home after the transaction. <br /><br />Anyways thats my limited understanding.

				Here&#039;s what I already posted in &quot;MtGox is dead for Roaders&quot;:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The thing that skeches me out most about LocalBitcoins is.... they&#039;ll somehow find a way to get my cash and fraud me on the actual BTC transaction.&nbsp; Like get my address wrong without me knowing or something.&quot;<br /><br />No way. Not if you use the LBC system the right way. You have the BTC seller fund the transaction right before the meetup. He does this by sending the bitcoins to an LBC holding wallet. That shows you he&#039;s not bullshit. Then after receiving your cash, he releases the bitcoins to your LBC wallet. If you list your cell number secretly on the site you&#039;ll get a text with a confirmation code only you will know confirming the release of your bitcoins. You can also login to your account and just check it to make sure it&#039;s been released. After that you can immediately transfer the BTC to your own wallet elsewhere. Escrow is only needed if a bank transfer is involved, since you&#039;re not meeting in person and have to trust someone else online whom you&#039;ve never met. Sound familiar?&nbsp; 8)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m very familiar with the LBC system and have used it a bunch of times.

				I&#039;m not in Canada so I can&#039;t say for sure if there are different regulations for if you&#039;re out of the country or inside...&nbsp; but I&#039;ve recently used nanaimogold, which is based in BC, Canada and I&#039;ve purchased BTC from them via Western Union cash transfer.&nbsp; They are a bit more pricey that I&#039;d like, but I had no problems with them and they don&#039;t ask for much in the way of personal info.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then again, like I say, maybe this is only an option with them if you are outside of Canada...&nbsp; &nbsp;that, I don&#039;t know...&nbsp; Wishing you luck though :)

				Ok everyone in Canada prepare to love me (clearnet Warning) www.1616exchange.com (clearnet warning) This site is truly anonymous.Send them an email anytime they will reply FAST you use WU or you can actually send money in the mail to them if you do not mind waiting/sending cash in the mail and do not want to pay WU fee&#039;s.You do not need to produce I.D at WU you are supposed to write your name but just write whatever they do not ask.Once you send them the M.T.C.N within the hour(usually within 15 min) you will get confirmation that your BTC are on the way!<br /><br />I have used them many times they do not disapoint!They are open on weekends as well so Sunday night you can grab some coins if you have a WU close that is open.Local bitcoins is supposed to be great as well but 1616 have never let me down i almost do not want to spread the word about them but hey gotta help out the fellow Canuck&#039;s hope you all get your coins and get to enjoy the road anonymous!<br /><br />Edit-- Heck ask the creator of this post... i told him about 1616 earlier this week and he said they were great!

				And now Canadainbitcoins.com isn&#039;t taking cash anonymously. Guess I&#039;ll have to bite the bullet and get verified with an exchange.

I had em an under an hour late on&nbsp; a sunday !!<br /><br />

				So with the recent changes to some Canadian websites, I&#039;ve been looking into some new options for acquiring bitcoins anonymously in Canada. <br />So far I’ve found the following:<br />https://www.nanaimogold.com/ <br />They accept cash by mail. <br />They also accept direct cash deposits to their account up to $500.<br />They seem pretty legit. <br />They’ve been around a while and they have a presence on the bitcointalk forums. <br />Though from the feedback I&#039;ve seen, their customer service isn&#039;t always quick.<br />Looks like they sell for about 10% above mtgox.<br /><br />http://cadbitcoin.com/<br />Buys/Sells bitcoins for cash in person in TO.<br />Can’t find a way to contact them by email but their address is on their webpage.<br />Looks like they sell for about 10% above mtgox.<br /><br />http://www.bitcoiniacs.com/<br />Buys/sells bitcoins in person in Vancouver.<br />They have a storefront but I’m not 100% certain that its open yet.<br />They will accept cash in the mail.<br />They buy at 7% above the current CAVirtex rate.<br />Their customer service seems quick, responsive and friendly.<br /><br />In addition to this I have been referred to two people who sell on localbitcoins.com that some of my customers have used. They sell by cash in the mail for 3-5% above mtgox. I haven’t personally dealt with either of them but they come highly recommended by reliable, regular customers.
