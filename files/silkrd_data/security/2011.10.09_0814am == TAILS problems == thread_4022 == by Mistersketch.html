				Well it&#039;s generally bad practice to save ANYTHING that could come back to haunt you later.<br />That being said i know what you&#039;re talking about and i think i have a fast easy solution for you.<br /><br />http://www.linuxliveusb.com/<br /><br />&quot;<br /><br />What is persistence?<br /><br />Usually, on a live CD or Live USB key, all modifications are discarded when you reboot.<br /><br />The persistence allows you to keep your preferences and data even after reboot.<br /><br />The data are stored in a special file called casper-rw (for Ubuntu) and overlay-USBLABEL-UUID (for Fedora). This is a completely transparent process for the user.<br /><br />&nbsp;Usually, 300 MB are enough to install some software but you can use more.<br /><br />&quot;<br /><br />Make sure you configure it to use persistence and i think you&#039;ll be good to go.<br /><br />You&#039;re welcome and i do believe you said something about compensation for fast results (*cough cough) lol

				To answer your question here:<br /><br />OpenBSD is a security focused OS<br />Backtrack is a penetration based OS<br /><br />These i&#039;ve heard of but know nothing as to where they are or how to get/use them.<br />----<br />OWL<br /><br />http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/primer.xml<br /><br />Hardened gentoo, has a bunch of antiexploitation patches put in.<br /><br />I know for a fact that backtrack works with that software and can do<br />persistence quite well.<br /><br /><br />Anyway i am bossman, but since the forums synched back up i can&#039;t seem to log in so i made a new account, i requested a new password be sent to my email but idk how long that will take. In the mean time i&#039;m working on getting a virtual wallet for my bitcoins, does anyone know of any good one to use, i had a place in mind about a week ago and i thought i bookmarked but apparently not so any links or help would be nice. <br />Check out my (bossman)s signature it&#039;s boss@tormail.net so if you don&#039;t believe me you can email me there and i can help you out with more specific concerns if you want or...idk lol.<br />Hope that helps i&#039;ll try and post my bitcoin address when i can log back in or get a decent one online cause i&#039;ve been having too many issues with the software based one.
