				&quot;Cop Recorder&quot; for the iphone.<br /><br />Basically it discretely records once you start up the app, and then you have the option of uploading your encounter to their website where your audio file gets exposure as well as a review from volunteer lawyers to make sure the honkers didn&#039;t get out of line.<br /><br />Also there&#039;s &quot;Open Watch&quot; for the android.&nbsp; Pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />http://www.yaliberty.org/posts/recording-police-encounters-theres-an-app-for-that

				Awesome.&nbsp; But be careful, there are a lot of laws going onto the books that are laying out serious penalties for recording them.&nbsp; A girl is looking at up to 5 years in prison, I think in Pennsylvania or Illinois, for videotaping a cop sexually assault her.&nbsp; The cop hasn&#039;t even been written up (he should be shot in the kneecaps and his tiny chicken-shit balls)

				Sorry for resurrecting an old thread but I&#039;m curious as to the legality of such an app. Are you allowed to record your own conversations with law enforcement if you haven&#039;t been arrested at the point of recording? I&#039;ve been in confrontations where I was temporarily detained and officers have said some questionable things. Such an app could prove to be valuable leverage.

				You can record.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t let the cops know, and check your state laws.&nbsp; Currently there are 9 states that have put laws on the books that makes recording police under any circumstances illegal, unless you have their express permission.&nbsp; Some of them have no limits on maximum sentences for these crimes, so be careful.&nbsp; usually people in these states get ten times the punishment for recording cops as it is for whatever crime they have been arrest for in the first place.&nbsp; (Correction, mostly &quot;crime&quot;)

				Whether it&#039;s the law or not, the police, and people in positions of power in general, don&#039;t play by the rules. The power goes to their heads. It&#039;s sad but true. Keep that in mind.

				Here in my state (live free or die) we have had multiple occurrences of people recording cops and then being arrested/charged, however they have been rightfully protected by their constitutional rights. However the cops are also protected by the police commission and the state from charges being brought against them for trying shit like that.
