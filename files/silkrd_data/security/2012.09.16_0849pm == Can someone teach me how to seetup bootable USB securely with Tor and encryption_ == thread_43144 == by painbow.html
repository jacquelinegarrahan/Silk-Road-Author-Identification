				The current Tails distro allows you to use Truecrypt.&nbsp; Once you have Tails set up on a USB drive you can make it include Truecrypt in the Applications -&gt; Accessories menu.&nbsp; At boot time, wait for the Tails menu (It will show two options: Live and Live(Failsafe)).&nbsp; Hit the Tab key and at the command line type in &#039;truecrypt&#039; (without the quotes).&nbsp; When Tails boots you&#039;ll be able to use Truecrypt along with all the other apps available from the drop-down menus.

				i think this is one of those things that if you have to ask how to do it you shouldn&#039;t be doing it at all<br /><br />better to grab one of the anonymity-geared distros like liberte or aos, they were not made in a day and are generally very good at what they aim to do

				Just have a few questions regarding using truecrypt through tails<br /><br />1. Is there anyway to actually encrypt the original USB that tails is installed into, so that when u boot into tails with the USB drive, it asks for a password?<br />2. Is truecrypt just used to create a secured location for sensitive files? or can it also be used to create a secure location for sensitive programs, such as TOR and PGP?<br />3. As a small time buyer, is truecrypt really necessary? I dont really have any sensitive information thats stored? Only thing i can think of is PGP keys, but there all things that are only used once, so keeping them is not necessary.<br />4. If LE got a hold of the original USB drive that tails is installed onto, but no sensitive information is held, like only thing on the USB drive is tails, tor and PGP, can they use that against me?<br /><br />At this point, i just cant really see a beneficial reason to even use truecrypt

				1 and 2. You can create an Encrypted File Container, which creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file or Encrypt a Non-System Partition/Drive which encrypts a non-system partition on an internal or external drive with the option of creating a hidden volume.

At the moment, to access my tails OS, all you have to do is plug in the USB drive, and tails pops up. Sure I can encrypt a volume within the USB stick to store sensitive information, but what im trying to do is encrypt the original bootable section of the USB stick that has tails installed on it, so that when you first plug in the USB stick, it doesnt automatically boot up tails, instead you are prompted for a password before even entering into the OS. What would be even better is to setup 2 bootable OS&#039;s, one safe one that can be used for plausible deniability, and then a secondary OS that has TOR and PGP.&nbsp; <br /><br />So basically what im trying to achieve, is when you plug in the USB drive, it asks for a password. If the safe fake password is entered, it boots up some stock standard safe linux distro, one that doesnt come with TOR and PGP preinstalled. But if you enter the real password, then tails boots up. Is something like this even possible to do?<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone through the truecrypt website back to front and cant seem to find the relevant information.

				Hi rogerdavid,<br /><br />I found this which should help you with regards to the questions you&#039;ve asked.<br /><br />System Encryption.<br /><br />TrueCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, i.e. a partition or drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.<br /><br />System encryption provides the highest level of security and privacy, because all files, including any temporary files that Windows and applications create on the system partition (typically, without your knowledge or consent), hibernation files, swap files, etc., are always permanently encrypted (even when power supply is suddenly interrupted). Windows also records large amounts of potentially sensitive data, such as the names and locations of files you open, applications you run, etc. All such log files and registry entries are always permanently encrypted too.<br /><br />System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct password each time before Windows boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by the TrueCrypt Boot Loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive and on the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk.<br /><br />Note that TrueCrypt can encrypt an existing unencrypted system partition/drive in-place while the operating system is running (while the system is being encrypted, you can use your computer as usual without any restrictions). Likewise, a TrueCrypt-encrypted system partition/drive can be decrypted in-place while the operating system is running. You can interrupt the process of encryption or decryption anytime, leave the partition/drive partially unencrypted, restart or shut down the computer, and then resume the process, which will continue from the point it was stopped.<br /><br />To encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, select System &gt; Encrypt System Partition/Drive and then follow the instructions in the wizard. To decrypt a system partition/drive, select System &gt; Permanently Decrypt System Partition/Drive.<br /><br />The mode of operation used for system encryption is XTS (see the section Modes of Operation). For further technical details of system encryption, see the section Encryption Scheme in the chapter Technical Details.<br /><br />Note: By default, Windows 7 and later boot from a special small partition. The partition contains files that are required to boot the system. Windows allows only applications that have administrator privileges to write to the partition (when the system is running). TrueCrypt encrypts the partition only if you choose to encrypt the whole system drive (as opposed to choosing to encrypt only the partition where Windows is installed).<br /><br />Hope that helps. :)<br />

I understand you want Windows 7 on your main system, standard install for day to day activities, a Linux OS installed on the flash drive to &quot;seem normal&quot; and another OS installed on a hidden encrypted partition. Truecrypt gives you a 3 step password process as detailed below. Sorry for the long post.<br /><br /><br />Hidden Operating System<br /><br />If your system partition or system drive is encrypted using TrueCrypt, you need to enter your pre-boot authentication password in the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen after you turn on or restart your computer. It may happen that you are forced by somebody to decrypt the operating system or to reveal the pre-boot authentication password. There are many situations where you cannot refuse to do so (for example, due to extortion). TrueCrypt allows you to create a hidden operating system whose existence should be impossible to prove (provided that certain guidelines are followed — see below). Thus, you will not have to decrypt or reveal the password for the hidden operating system.<br /><br /><br />Before you continue reading this section, make sure you have read the section Hidden Volume and that you understand what a hidden TrueCrypt volume is.<br /><br /><br />A hidden operating system is a system (for example, Windows 7 or Windows XP) that is installed in a hidden TrueCrypt volume. It should be impossible to prove that a hidden TrueCrypt volume exists (provided that certain guidelines are followed; for more information, see the section Hidden Volume) and, therefore, it should be impossible to prove that a hidden operating system exists.<br /><br />However, in order to boot a system encrypted by TrueCrypt, an unencrypted copy of the TrueCrypt Boot Loader has to be stored on the system drive or on a TrueCrypt Rescue Disk. Hence, the mere presence of the TrueCrypt Boot Loader can indicate that there is a system encrypted by TrueCrypt on the computer. Therefore, to provide a plausible explanation for the presence of the TrueCrypt Boot Loader, the TrueCrypt helps you create a second encrypted operating system, so-called decoy operating system, during the process of creation of a hidden operating system. A decoy operating system must not contain any sensitive files. Its existence is not secret (it is not installed in a hidden volume). The password for the decoy operating system can be safely revealed to anyone forcing you to disclose your pre-boot authentication password.*<br /><br />You should use the decoy operating system as frequently as you use your computer. Ideally, you should use it for all activities that do not involve sensitive data. Otherwise, plausible deniability of the hidden operating system might be adversely affected (if you revealed the password for the decoy operating system to an adversary, he could find out that the system is not used very often, which might indicate the existence of a hidden operating system on your computer). Note that you can save data to the decoy system partition anytime without any risk that the hidden volume will get damaged (because the decoy system is not installed in the outer volume — see below).<br /><br />There will be two pre-boot authentication passwords — one for the hidden system and the other for the decoy system. If you want to start the hidden system, you simply enter the password for the hidden system in the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen (which appears after you turn on or restart your computer). Likewise, if you want to start the decoy system (for example, when asked to do so by an adversary), you just enter the password for the decoy system in the TrueCrypt Boot Loader screen.<br /><br />Note: When you enter a pre-boot authentication password, the TrueCrypt Boot Loader first attempts to decrypt (using the entered password) the last 512 bytes of the first logical track of the system drive (where encrypted master key data for non-hidden encrypted system partitions/drives are normally stored). If it fails and if there is a partition behind the active partition, the TrueCrypt Boot Loader (even if there is actually no hidden volume on the drive) automatically tries to decrypt (using the same entered password again) the area of the first partition behind the active partition where the encrypted header of a possible hidden volume might be stored (however, if the size of the active partition is less than 256 MB, then the data is read from the second partition behind the active one, because Windows 7 and later, by default, do not boot from the partition on which they are installed). Note that TrueCrypt never knows if there is a hidden volume in advance (the hidden volume header cannot be identified, as it appears to consist entirely of random data). If the header is successfully decrypted (for information on how TrueCrypt determines that it was successfully decrypted, see the section Encryption Scheme), the information about the size of the hidden volume is retrieved from the decrypted header (which is still stored in RAM), and the hidden volume is mounted (its size also determines its offset). For further technical details, see the section Encryption Scheme in the chapter Technical Details.<br /><br />When running, the hidden operating system appears to be installed on the same partition as the original operating system (the decoy system). However, in reality, it is installed within the partition behind it (in a hidden volume). All read/write operations are transparently redirected from the system partition to the hidden volume. Neither the operating system nor applications will know that data written to and read from the system partition is actually written to and read from the partition behind it (from/to a hidden volume). Any such data is encrypted and decrypted on the fly as usual (with an encryption key different from the one that is used for the decoy operating system).<br /><br />Note that there will also be a third password — the one for the outer volume. It is not a pre-boot authentication password, but a regular TrueCrypt volume password. It can be safely disclosed to anyone forcing you to reveal the password for the encrypted partition where the hidden volume (containing the hidden operating system) resides. Thus, the existence of the hidden volume (and of the hidden operating system) will remain secret. If you are not sure you understand how this is possible, or what an outer volume is, please read the section Hidden Volume. The outer volume should contain some sensitive-looking files that you actually do not want to hide.<br /><br />To summarize, there will be three passwords in total. Two of them can be revealed to an attacker (for the decoy system and for the outer volume). The third password, for the hidden system, must remain secret.<br /><br /><br />In the next steps, the wizard will create two TrueCrypt volumes (outer and hidden) within the first partition behind the system partition. The hidden volume will contain the hidden operating system. The size of the hidden volume is always the same as the size of the system partition. The reason is that the hidden volume will need to contain a clone of the content of the system partition (see below). Note that the clone will be encrypted using a different encryption key than the original. Before you start copying some sensitive-looking files to the outer volume, the wizard tells you the maximum recommended size of space that the files should occupy, so that there is enough free space on the outer volume for the hidden volume.<br /><br />All the rest of the info can be downloaded from the link I previously posted today. :)<br />

				rogerdavid, this is directly from the Truecrypt FAQ section.<br /><br />&quot;How can I use TrueCrypt on a USB flash drive? <br /><br />You have two options:<br /><br />1. Encrypt the entire USB flash drive. However, you will not be able run TrueCrypt from the USB flash drive.<br />Note: Windows does not support multiple partitions on USB flash drives.<br /><br /><br />2. Create a TrueCrypt file container on the USB flash drive (for information on how to do so, see the chapter Beginner&#039;s Tutorial, in the TrueCrypt User Guide). If you leave enough space on the USB flash drive (choose an appropriate size for the TrueCrypt container), you will also be able to store TrueCrypt on the USB flash drive (along with the container – not in the container) and you will be able to run TrueCrypt from the USB flash drive (see also the chapter Portable Mode in the TrueCrypt User Guide).<br /><br />Does TrueCrypt also encrypt file names and folder names? <br /><br />Yes. The entire file system within a TrueCrypt volume is encrypted (including file names, folder names, and contents of every file). This applies to both types of TrueCrypt volumes – i.e., to file containers (virtual TrueCrypt disks) and to TrueCrypt-encrypted partitions/devices.<br /><br /><br />I posted the link to the TrueCrypt docs on an earlier post for you to look at. Using the free TrueCrypt software, you can create an encrypted, secure USB flash drive for use on SR.

				Ben, what are you on about? Truecrypt can encrypt a HDD (hard disk drive) and can&nbsp; run in so-called portable mode, which means that it does not have to be installed on the operating system under which it is run.

Link is below for you (clearnet site)<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=truecrypt-portable<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ive tried a few times with no success however im not that technically savvy but i thought a portable HDD like a USB is unable to handle a portable OS

				im on the same page as ben cousins.<br /><br />all the stuff that wadozo has been linking refer to installing a hidden OS onto a HDD on a PC, or creating a encrypted volume on a USB.<br /><br />None of this information is helpful, since we&#039;re trying to create a hidden OS on a bootable USB, not on the HDD of the PC.<br /><br />If i encrypt the entire USB drive following the instructions on the truecrypt website, i then cant run the USBinstaller to install tails onto the drive, because its no longer recognised, because its encrypted. Even if i was somehow able to run the USBinstaller and install it, I still wouldnt have plausable deniability, because only 1 OS would be installed and not a 2nd hidden one.<br /><br />Lastly USB drives cant be partitioned, so i cant follow the instructions truecrypt says about installing a hidden OS onto a HDD on a PC, and apply that to a USB drive.<br /><br />Wadozo i appreciate your help, but could you please be a little more helpful than just posting vague links that don&#039;t really seem to get us anywhere. As i&#039;ve said earlier, ive read all the related guides on truecrypt about 15 times now, continously linking them isn&#039;t going to help.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually starting to think, that what were trying to achieve is not even possible. It would be nice if someone could come in here and verify that it is possible, and maybe give a run down on how to do it.

Tails is shipped with LUKS full disk encryption implemented since v.0.12. <br /><br />**CLEARNET**Link: https://tails.boum.org/todo/remove_cryptkeeper/ **CLEARNET**<br /><br />The tails installation is a pretty straightforward process. Their are 2 seperate ways to create a Tails live USB. The first one is where you burn a live CD then boot off of live CD and create a live USB from inside tails. The second you simply use the usb instllation tool from pendrivelinux. Keep in mind that not creating a live USB from inside tails will mean you have no persistant storage. This can be a good or a bad thing depending on your goals. <br /><br />**CLEARNET** Live CD-&gt;Live USB Link: https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html **CLEARNET**<br />**CLEARNET** Tails USB Installer Link: https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/index.en.html **CLEARNET**

Your Public IP address would be different than the exit node IP address. I don&#039;t think you realize how difficult and expensive this little surveillance would be not to mention highly unlikely.

If you are browsing this with any of your Attribute&#039;s Ratings with a Red (meaning Critical Security flaw) then you should seriously solve that problem ASAP or else you risk your real IP being uncovered. And nobody on Silk Road would want that, am I right?<br /><br />Keep in mind that the majority of SR users are buyers, so naturally they don&#039;t need any more security than TBB although they should still make sure that all their TBB security settings, according to ip-check.info, are optimized for anonymousity. <br /><br />Proxy Judge is another good site for testing your security/anonymousity settings for TOR on.<br />http://www.stilllistener.addr.com<br />

				Aidoneus, I was intending on letting it go but the this dickhead has now accused me of (In Ben&#039;s words) &quot; attempting to use mine and other peoples lines in some sort of vague attempt to insult me.&quot; This bloke is not the full quid. ::) So I have asked him to PUT UP OR SHUT UP!! If he posts evidence of this, I&#039;ll gladly apologize and move on. However, it&#039;s just complete bullshit and a lie from a wanker who in his hey day, would have trouble spelling the word goat, still puts any teeth that fall out under his pillow for the Tooth Fairy and writes to Santa every year and complains he never gets a reply!&nbsp; ???

As I previously posted, I&#039;ll gladly apologize to anyone who&#039;s post I plagiarized and used as my own but I know for a fact and am 100% certain of, I haven&#039;t and would never do such a thing. I am an educated person Ben, capable of writing my own posts based on my own thoughts, knowledge and beliefs, which ever the case may be. You, on the other hand, are clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed, maybe a beer short of a six pack or perhaps just best described as a real life dumb cunt. :-[
