Was my first and last time i will transfer money to them and wrote an email whats this about but im expecting not much of them...

				Hi mate, <br /><br />I registered on the forum as I have exactly the same problem as you and looking for some answers. Was wondering if this issue got solved?<br /><br />Has anyone else had this issue with VirWox or have any idea as to why they might be blocking accounts like this? I sent them an email regarding this issue but haven&#039;t obtained a response since.<br /><br />Also, checked my address on blockexplorer and it detected no transactions. Any help appreciated.

				i&#039;ve had issues with virwox before where it would take days to transfer to a bitcoin address. i finally just stopped using them all together and started using mtgox.

				It took a few days to transfer the bitcoin to my wallet but I got them. Unless I did something wrong, their fees are super high. Out of a $52 transaction. I got 30 bux in bitcoin and 9 dollars USD. I don&#039;t like that you can only buy whole bitcoins and no fractions.
