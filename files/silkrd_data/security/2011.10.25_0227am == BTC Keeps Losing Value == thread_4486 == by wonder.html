				&nbsp;I&#039;ve read quite a few articles in the past couple of days about the imminent demise of the bitcoin. I was just wandering what we&#039;re going to do if it never recovers, and completely implodes. Are there any other methods for anonymous payment? Would SR survive? Could it be that LE doesn&#039;t even care about SR, because they know that our currency is dying?

				Tell me about it ... <br /><br />Though I have been told by a couple of people recently that BTC was/is in a bubble, and that I can only blame myself for trading at that time.<br /><br />The only thing to do is wait for the rate to (hopefully) level off and take it from there, i guess...<br /><br />It&#039;s all a gamble, but I (and many of us here) still have a lot of faith in the BTC. So hang in there, and take the chance...

				This actually brings up a newbie question for me, seeing the recent drops in BTC conversion and the &quot;sky is falling&quot; reports on the tech blogs about &quot;implosion.&quot; (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/10/bitcoin-implodes-down-more-than-90-percent-from-june-peak.ars)<br /><br />Looks like a pretty classic investment bubble to me. There was no way it was really worth that much. That&#039;s how it stands as an investment platform.<br /><br />But as I understand it, BTC was never really meant to be an investment medium, but a real time exchange medium. And it&#039;s a decentralized protocol. So as long as people choose to use to as an exchange (for the advantages we see on SR and other sites), it won&#039;t go away.<br /><br />Am I wrong there? It can&#039;t be &quot;shut down&quot; and as long as there is a community that values what it offers, it will be useful for purchase.

				Yep: kind of like this site itself, it&#039;s an all new form of doing commerce.&nbsp; Ever since &#039;real&#039; money quit being based upon anything tangible, &#039;money&#039; has been very hard to define.&nbsp; And the huge rise...then fall...just show our wariness.&nbsp; But I think it&#039;s calming down, somewhere between 2 and 3 dollars...but what&#039;s a dollar worth?&nbsp; It&#039;s not based on anything real either...time will come, world gets crazy enough, btc--and gold--and a shotgun-- will be real handy to own.&nbsp; And most of us hate the bounces, but this whole site is possible because of btc...without it, we&#039;d just have another lame dopesite.
