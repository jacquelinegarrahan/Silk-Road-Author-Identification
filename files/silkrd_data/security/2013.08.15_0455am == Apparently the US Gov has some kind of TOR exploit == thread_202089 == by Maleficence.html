				I was reading on a FB page I am subscribed to something about how some branch of the US Gov was able to use some sort of exploit to get lots of user&#039;s personal information on some TOR site I can&#039;t remember which one, but then I thought &quot;well fuck me they are probably cleaning house on Silkroad, Atlantis, BMR, etc&quot; so I didn&#039;t log on for a few days to be safe until I heard more information. Well, tonight I put my big boy pants on and checked the forums on here, and I didn&#039;t see a single topic about this.&nbsp; The source I read it on was a legit one.&nbsp; I&#039;d have to go on the regular internet, and search around a bit to find that article about how they were exploiting the TOR software to find user&#039;s IP address&#039;s and shit, but I was hoping maybe somebody on here knew more about this than me? If no one seems to have heard of this (I highly doubt it, because generally people on here are 10 steps ahead of me when it comes to this kind of news..) I am willing to go search around, and find the link to that article, but I was hoping someone on here had the scoop on this. Do you think it&#039;s safe to use our accounts on the main pages? I have a bad feeling about this, and I&#039;m not the most paranoid dude.

				Oh, thank god.. https://thehackernews.com/2013/08/Firefox-Exploit-Tor-Network-child-pornography-Freedom-Hosting.html is the link to the article I read, and it would seem that that is the same FH thing.. Ok. I feel a lot better now. I thought they had exploited tor itself, and just went for the childporn first, cause let&#039;s face it the NSA doesn&#039;t look too hot lately, and going for the child porno first before the infamous &quot;War on Drugs&quot; would be in their best interest, but you&#039;d better believe had that been the case the DEA would be fucking GUNNING for Silkroad, and we&#039;d all be locked up man.&nbsp; Good. I was fucking scared for a second. Sorry guys for posting an ignorant topic I didn&#039;t know any better, but I think it was a legitimate concern.&nbsp; I am not quite as security savvy as many of you, and I&#039;m about to become a vendor soon, and that article spooked me a bit. Sorry again.
