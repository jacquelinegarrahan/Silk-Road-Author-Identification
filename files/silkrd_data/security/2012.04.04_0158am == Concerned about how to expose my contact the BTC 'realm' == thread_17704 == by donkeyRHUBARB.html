				At some point in the BTC rabbit hole you have to contact the world of BTC in a some what compromising manner. This is the rub that I have concerns about. <br />The point where you have to leave Tor and the deep web to interface with services that move currency from your brick &amp; mortar bank like bitinstant then move said digital equivalent of your bank notes to an exchange like MTGox for BTC then start the vapor trail for tumbling your BTC before you deposit to SR.<br /><br />What is the least compromising approach to establishing contact with services like bitinstant and MTGox? Currently I have thought about using bitinstant&#039;s cash deposit then from there to an exchange then to bitcoin fog, instawallet then to my PC&#039;s bitwallet then to SR. The problem for me is at some point you have to use non-proxies or Tor to access bitinstant and MTGox. Where I live it is difficult to find &#039;public access&#039; computers w/o showing some form of ID. I do not have a laptop to fish for open connections. Right now I&#039;m finding it difficult to assess the risk of using public computers that require ID and have surveillance cameras. I mean is it acceptable risk to login to the exchange sites without hiding your IP? How much trouble can you get into for exchanging $ for bitcoins then moving BTCs around before they eventually end up at SR?

				If you&#039;re just buying personal amounts of drugs you have nothing to worry about. Buy some bitcoins, transfer them to yourself, then transfer them to SR. Use truecrypt to encrypt wallet.dat once it&#039;s empty of coins with a gargantuan random character password then wipe it from your disk.<br /><br />

				Create a truecrypt container on the USB. Use it to store your GPG keys, passwords, email logins or whatever else.<br />Then you burn Tails or Liberte to CD and just plug in the USB and decrypt it whenever you want to use it. I used to do that with an encrypted IronKey until I started using a different system, but it works fine. I never installed Tails directly to a USB because that kind of defeats the point, I would&#039;ve had evidence lying around unencrypted whereas the live CD is read only. <br /><br />On the tails bootup screen, you can press tab and just type &#039;truecrypt&#039; and press enter and it will be available when you boot up. Or just download it from the site and double click to install it while using tails. <br /><br />When you first boot up tails (if you have no gpg key) you simply generate a new one clicking System-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Passwords &amp; Encryption Keys in the top menu, then export both the private and public key (they&#039;re text files). You move them to your truecrypt container. Next time you nee d to use them (rebooting tails), just double click them and Tails automatically adds them to your keyring. <br /><br />Can also just download Virtualbox, and any operating system .iso like debian, archlinux, windowsXP. It&#039;s a window on your desktop that loads a new operating system, so you have two comps at once basically. It creates a 2g (or however big you want) .VDI file and installs whatever operating system you want onto it. Now you have a seekrit computer to use. Install Tor browser, bitcoin program, ect. Then take a snapshot. Your virtual computer is saved and will reboot to that state evertime. When you&#039;re down, truecrypt the .VDI snapshot into a container. Nobody can access it now.<br />https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Screenshots<br /><br />I use Virtualbox on a shitty 1G mem laptop running debian and it works fine for testing.

				Forgot to add, if you want a free XP copy<br />http://www.zone54.com/<br />Note the right side, they are piratebay links to his torrents there<br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7110234/Windows_XP_Professional_SP3_32-bit_-_Black_Edition_2012.3.17<br /><br />Download that and have Virtualbox use the .iso for the virtual CDrom. It will boot and install<br />Better to use linux though. Debian .iso&#039;s are more secure obviously<br />

				if you go down the virtualbox path you might want to use &quot;portable virtualbox&quot; which is installed/runs off the USB.
