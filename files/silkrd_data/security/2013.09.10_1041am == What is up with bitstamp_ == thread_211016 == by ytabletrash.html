				Noticed on bitcoincharts.com/markets bitstamp hasnt had a trade in 14 hours, but on their website they have a different price that seems to be changing and thus having trades. Based on how the SR price is calculated (gox + bitstamp /2) The price on the website is off by ~$2 a bitcoin. Not sure if this is due to bitcoincharts fucking up or bitstamp changing their code and thus not allowing bitcoincharts to read their prices and thus giving sr the wrong numbers but something is definitely up.

Its just the API which www.bitcoincharts.com uses which is off for Bitstamp. Buys and sells work fine today.

				@friendlyface, I know but its throwing off the price on the road because SR is reading off the broken number instead of the number bitstamp is actually selling at.
