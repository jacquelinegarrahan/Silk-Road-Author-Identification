				I&#039;ve been using TOR/bitcoin-qt on my imac but have decided I want to run it off a USB on a spare laptop.<br />What is the best method for completely clearing any traces of these programs ever being on my computer (aside from the secure empty trash) option.<br /><br />cheers

				Search function at the top of the forum, &quot;delete tor&quot;, first page of results:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72700<br /><br />The short story is that there no safe way to remove individual files from journaled filesystems. It&#039;s possible the files were written to multiple places on the disk and a good forensics program could search the free space and find them.<br /><br />The only safe way is a full disk wipe with something like DBAN, but you would have to backup all important data and reinstall the OS.

				On Windows there&#039;s the added problem of defragmenting, which moves files around and only &quot;deletes&quot; the old copies in the sense of removing the pointers. They still exist on disk. <br /><br />I agree the mere presence of Tor isn&#039;t illegal and wouldn&#039;t worry about it as long as you didn&#039;t save a link to SR in your bookmarks, but OP asked how to remove it anyway.<br /><br />I firmly believe that a random write across the whole hard drive is the only safe way to remove all potential traces of a file. &quot;Shredding&quot; programs that overwrite individual files multiple times are an illusion of safety, since they only overwrite the most recent copy of the file, that the OS knows about.

See the discussion I had with someone here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71415.msg686230#msg686230<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97109.msg688348#msg688348">Quote from: peeweed on December 28, 2012, 10:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only real way to have a completely TORless system is to not download or run it on your computer.&nbsp; Use a VM or a Live USB OS (like linux) to download run/setup and use Tor.&nbsp; Even then encryption is still highly suggested since these are more &quot;stealth&quot; security, you also want &quot;lock/key&quot; security if found.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe full disk encryption is safe as long as the device isn&#039;t on when LE arrives, so they can&#039;t extract the encryption key from RAM, but realistically speaking, the LE that pursue a drug buyer or low level drug dealer won&#039;t be sophisticated enough to do that, so I believe full disk encryption is safe in our threat model. Although, as discussed in the link above, an OS on real-only media or in a VM with FDE are the strongest protection.
