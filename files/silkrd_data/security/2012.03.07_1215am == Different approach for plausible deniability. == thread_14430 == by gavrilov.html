				For situations where plausible deniability is a top priority - e.g. if there is a risk of rubberhose cryptoanalysis if they find any encrypted data on you, no matter how hard you insist on it being just a filler rather than hidden partition - yet, there is a need to access persistent data, here is something I think could be used. Obviously, I invite comments and criticism.<br /><br />Preparation stage:<br />1. Create a Truecrypt -encrypted file container, small enough to just hold your private data (keys, contacts, bookmarks, any non-standard software you need).<br />2. Move the data to the container.<br />3. Upload the container over Tor to some anonymous storage provider.<br />4. Remove all traces of the container and data from your system.<br /><br />Now, to use:<br />1. Boot any live distro with Tor bundle and Truecrypt.<br />2. Start Tor.<br />3. Download the container<br />4. Work...<br />5. If private data were updated, dismount container and reupload it.<br />5. Clear memory &amp; reboot.<br /><br />For larger containers, step 3 could be replaced with mounting the file over nbd-http, with resulting read-only access to private data.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />- no encrypted data on any of your media,<br />- you&nbsp; only need to remember the URL and password<br />- you can access your data even if you have to build stuff from scratch<br /><br />Does it make sense?<br /><br />Max

				What&#039;s to stop LE from demanding the password and encryption keys of the anonymous storage site once they discover you&#039;re using it?<br /><br />But on a positive note this is a really good idea. Are there any anonymous storage sites on the onion network now? I&#039;ve used something called infoencrypt.com before, which acts as encryption/decryption without any installation, however you have to save the cyphertext to a physical state.

				Sounds extremely secure and might be a good idea if you do any super illegal shit.<br /><br />That said, it seems like a real hassle, especially since you&#039;d have to download your info over the Tor network, which is really slow.<br /><br />My idea would be to create hidden partition on a USB drive containing Liberte.<br /><br />I&#039;d then double bag the USB drive into small baggies, then place the outer-most baggie inside a realistic-looking small fake rock, then place the rock somewhere away from my home and property outside of plain sight.

However, and more practically with respect to the end result, a defendant can sometimes be forced to use a decryption password—without divulging it—and then to provide the files in readable form. Whether the government can compel decryption in this manner depends on a legal doctrine called “foregone conclusion” that was first articulated in a 1976 Supreme Court ruling relating to paper documents in a tax fraud case.<br /><br />Under the “foregone conclusion” doctrine as applied to digital documents, handing over files is not considered testimony if the government already knows that the files exist and what machines they live on. And when there is no testimony, the protection of the Fifth Amendment’s self-incrimination clause is not available.&quot;<br /><br /><br />If you haven&#039;t noticed, our rights have been slowly but steadily taken away over the last decade.

				It will eventually get to the supreme court. Lower courts have held people in contempt for not giving up password to hidden truecrypt volumes, even when their own experts admited they couldn&#039;t even prove there were hidden volumes. Essentially they ordered people to make ciphertext decrypt into things that would incriminate them, when they were not pleased with it decrypting into non incriminating things.

				sshfs is worth looking into<br /><br />http://linux.die.net/man/1/sshfs<br /><br />Essentially it lets you treat a drive on a remote system like a local drive.
