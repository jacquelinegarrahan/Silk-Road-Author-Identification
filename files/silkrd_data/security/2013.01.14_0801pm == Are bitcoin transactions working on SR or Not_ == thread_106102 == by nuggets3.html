				Just like the title states. I have seen several threads of people buying bitcoins and they aren&#039;t going to their SR wallet even after 100 confirmations. What is going on? I am supposed to make a big deposit tomorrow but I am scared it won&#039;t show up.<br /><br /><br />Any insight, and possible DPR can chime in?<br />

				It&#039;s not necessarily a big deal, but it&#039;s undeniable that something is fucked with bitcoin transactions in several different areas of the SR site.&nbsp; Transfering, withdrawals, deposits... they all appear to be nonfunctional.&nbsp; Just wait it out, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; But yes, something is wrong and it&#039;s not working now.<br /><br />Wait, 17:00?&nbsp; ... that&#039;s 5pm.&nbsp; 26 confirmations since then?&nbsp; Where the Hell are you?

				I tried withdrawing BTC from the site I buy Bitcoins from to my SR wallet, starting at 17:20 UTC. It is now 20:30 UTC, so three hours and ten minutes, with 20 confirmed transactions, without any moneyz on SR. It usually takes between five and ten confirmations before I have the BTC on Silk Road. <br /><br />I&#039;m somewhat glad that I&#039;m not alone in having these issues, hopefully it will all be solved soon!

				I agree with SS. There have been too many posts about bitcoin problems lately for it to be trolling or FUD. There are probably some issues with SR&#039;s accounting.<br /><br />The nice thing about bitcoins is that you have indisputable, cryptographically secure external proof of your transaction, at least for deposits and withdrawals. Internal transfers between accounts is another matter.
