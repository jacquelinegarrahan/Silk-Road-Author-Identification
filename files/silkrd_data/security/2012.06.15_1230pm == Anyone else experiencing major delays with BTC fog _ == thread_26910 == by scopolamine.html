				It&#039;s been over 15 hours since I withdrew my balance from bitcoin Fog with delay set at 0.<br /><br />Usually it starts transferring after an hour or so, but so far, nothing has happened, and my balance is now 0.00, meaning the coins must have gone somewhere!<br /><br />When I check the receiving address with blockchain explorer, it shows no sign of activity.<br /><br />I messaged the admin, but he hasn&#039;t responded yet.<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing these kinds of delays ?

And you won&#039;t see any bitcoins in your bitcoin fog account if you ordered them all sent. And you won&#039;t see any in SR until the moment when the first mini deposit has enough confirmations, which could vary anywhere between an hour and four hours. So this is normal.<br /><br />What I think is happening is that the time when they supposedly start the transfers, which you determine, is not in fact when they start. I think that for some reason the start time is now when your withdrawal order is &quot;qeued&quot; for starting, and they will start it some time later, again probably due to manpower problems if they do it manually (which I don&#039;t think happens) or hardware or software problems which I think is more likely. You don&#039;t mention the time frame you selected nor the start time. I would guess in another few hours you will start seeing the mini deposits accredited to your SR account. We&#039;re gonna have to get used to it, at least until they solve the problems.<br /><br />Neutron Man

				Its been going pretty slow for me too today. Not that slows, but about an hour or two longer than usual. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, it&#039;ll catch up eventually or be rejected and return the funds.

				I&#039;m having some major delay trying to get my coins deposited to bitcoin fog. I sent them from coinapult. Been over 5 hours and nothing appeared. Transaction states that the coins have &quot;Not yet been redeemed&quot;. I dunno what the problem is :-/

Deposited to the fog yesterday AM, set up a 6 hour transfer to SR with a one hour delay and the account balance at both ends is now zero. I suspect an issue with the fog and I hope they have it fixed today. I have&nbsp; a message in at both ends and I am impatiently waiting for a reply. I have used the fog many times and have never had a problem with them. My guess is that a lot of their business comes from SR travelers. It would cost them a chunk &#039;o change if word gets out that they are losing BC&#039;s.&nbsp;

				UPDATE:<br /><br />Support got back to me and reassured me this was just an internal system delay and not any kind of breach. As of a few hours ago, things started going through smoothly. In any case, they assured me that in case of any kind of loss, they will reimburse!<br /><br />Nothing to worry about.
