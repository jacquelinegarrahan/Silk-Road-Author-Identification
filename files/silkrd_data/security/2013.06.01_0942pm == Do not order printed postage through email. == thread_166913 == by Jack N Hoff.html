				I didn&#039;t know whether to put this in security or shipping because it has to do with both but in general this is a huge security concern.&nbsp; It has come to my attention that a user(s) of this forum has been sending a URL to a service that offers to print postage and email it to you in return for bitcoins in private messages here.&nbsp; This is not safe and quite frankly it sounds like law enforcement to me.&nbsp; I can not think of a legitimate legal use for a such a service and it is very dangerous for you and your customers for you to be using a service like this.&nbsp; A user has already informed me that they are using this service...<br /><br />This is from said website<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi and Welcome to [removed], a bitcoin-based shipping label provider, available from USPS for domestic and international flat rate packages. This is relatively simple, you fill out an ordersheet with your shipping information, pay with bitcoins, and receive your shipping labels in your inbox. The ordersheet does all the calculations for you, so no boring math, and i do all the processing so no tedious one-at-a-time ordering and customs forms to fill out. For now im doing this all manually, so orders placed during the day will be processed by the end of the night. All profits will be put towards making this instantaneous, so please support the bitcoin community by supporting my bitcoin business. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

It&#039;s the way it should be. Survival of the strongest or in this case the smartest. I&#039;m not if what you posted was perpetuated by LE however if I was a vendor would risk my freedom in the name of convenience? I haven&#039;t been on SR for that very long but I can tell the Pro vendors from the ones that don&#039;t give a fuck and steer clear. As a customer you should make your own discretion and how responsible a vendor is. Not trying to downplay the topic but if customers stick with well established reputable vendors than it&#039;s just that much more secure for you. You might pay a bit more but there&#039;s a reason for that. Sorry if I didn&#039;t elaborate more in my first post.

If it&#039;s such common knowledge then you think a &#039;smart&#039; vendor would know better than to do something outrageously stupid and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s vendors that did use that service. I&#039;m not hating at the OP it&#039;s good to share things like that. I&#039;ve just dealt with way too many shitty vendors and had my share of bad experiences with them that know I deal with only 2 ever.
