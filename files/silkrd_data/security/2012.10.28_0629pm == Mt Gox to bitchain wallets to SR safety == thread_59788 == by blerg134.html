				Hi All- i have a verified Mt gox account from which i will send bitcoins into multiple blockchain wallets all created with different ip addresses- i plan to thread the coins through at least 3 wallets before sending to SR.&nbsp; Do you think this is enough security? I just worry because it is a verified account.&nbsp; Would love your thoughts.&nbsp; thanks!

				That can easily be traced through the bitcoin log chain. The best way is to use Bitcoin Fog or some other Bitcoin laundering service. Your basically swapping your coins with someone else. It&#039;s hard to trace as long as you receive 100% fresh coins. The only way to follow the transactions is by using statistical analysis. Look this up.<br /><br />I would send your money to blockchain. From there use there anonymous washer to transfer to Bitcoin Fog. Keep the coins there for a week then transfer into your SR account. Make sure to access block chain and the fog using your Tor browser so your IP address isn&#039;t associated with the account or the transactions.<br /><br />Blockchain - http://blockchain.info/<br />Bitcoin Fog - http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br /><br />Hopefully that&#039;s easy enough to follow.<br /><br />Goldust

				The reason I said keep the coins in Bitcoin Fog for a week is so that you don&#039;t get any of the same Bitcoins back when you withdraw. The more the website is used the more of your original Bitcoins will have gone. This all depends how many Bitcoins you sent into the fog. If your sending thousands then you can imagine it&#039;s going to take ages. If you sent some Bitcoins into the fog and instantly withdrew the coins then your almost certain to have some of the coins you just deposited. If you have any of the same coins back when you withdraw, then this whole process is almost pointless because some clever person could trace it back to you using the publicly available Bitcoin log. A week is what they suggest a safe period. <br />&nbsp;<br />The reason I mentioned using Blockchains anonymous service as well is because you are trusting Bitcoin Fog to remove your transaction from their stored logs. They say they keep logs for 1 week in case something goes wrong.&nbsp; The same goes with Blockchain although they say logs are kept for just 1 day. How do you know they are telling the truth? What happens if they are compromised and their servers were investigated? Blockchain is also a legit company so logs could be requested by LE if they hadn&#039;t deleted them.<br /><br />This all sounds complicated but it&#039;s really easy and probably quicker than making several Bitcoin wallets to try and make the transfer look anonymous which won&#039;t work anyway.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you how paranoid you are about sending money to Silk Road. I&#039;m sure LE can guess your doing something illegal if your trying to make the Bitcoin trail impossible to follow. Silk Road also acts as a kind of mixer to hide your transactions. I don&#039;t know much about this though.<br /><br />The best option would be to purchase Bitcoins using cash so there is no name attached to the Bitcoins in the first place.<br /><br />Goldust
