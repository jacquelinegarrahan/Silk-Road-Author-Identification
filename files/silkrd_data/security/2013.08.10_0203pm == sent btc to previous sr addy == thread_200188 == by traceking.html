I know I&#039;ve sent to older BTC addresses in the past and they coins were in my wallet without issue.<br /><br />If you sent them to an address associated with a previous account, that you no longer can access, then you&#039;re out of luck.<br /><br />Either way update us if they show up in your wallet.

				when transferring btc to your sr wallet, or any wallet&nbsp; in fact, go to silk road, click account, then copy/pasta the btc address straight from there into the wallet you&#039;re transferring them from. never ever ever ever use a copy of the wallet address that you saved somewhere or whatever. always copy/pasta at the time you&#039;re transferring them at, don&#039;t even try typing the address out, copy/pasta every time. you&#039;re very lucky you got them tbh.
