				Unless you buy face-to-face with cash the transaction won&#039;t be anonymous - not that this matters unless one is making very large purchases of btc. As for &#039;washing&#039; them, another option is to move the coins to a Blockchain wallet and then send from there using &#039;shared send&#039;. This costs around 0.5% as I recall, but makes it close to impossible to trace the origin from the destination address.

You meet the seller, give them the cash and have them send the btc to a blockchain wallet like bitcoin fog which washes the coins.

				On local bitcoins you are given a four digit code when you place an order and you have to memorize it.<br />When the seller has sent the coin to you the code is then released to him. So when your seller tells you the code you know your coin has been sent.<br />No need for a smartphone. :)<br /><br />Bitcoin fog sends your coin though a load of dummy transactions to make it very hard to track.

				Hi mate<br /><br />bitcoinfog is excellent IME. its allows you to create multiple addresses to deposit coins and charges a variable rate between 1 and 3% IIRC.<br /><br />It then tumbles them out to your clean address over a period of time and with a&nbsp; start delay so anyone watching addresses can&#039;t sit there and see shit happening.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure too much step by step guide is useful here as we don&#039;t to give too much away to the lazy lardarses from Dock Green :)<br /><br />t<br />
