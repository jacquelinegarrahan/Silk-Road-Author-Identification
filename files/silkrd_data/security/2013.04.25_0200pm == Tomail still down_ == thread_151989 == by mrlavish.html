They refuse requests and subpoenas from all LE agencies that don&#039;t go through the proper Canadian authority channels. You must realize that ALL clearnet services MUST operate this way or face criminal prosecution. Hushmail is at least better than gmail, which has been known to hand over emails WITHOUT a warrant. The idea that LE has a password that works for all accounts seems highly unlikely to me. Hushmail would have no customer trust if this rumor had ANY veracity to it.<br /><br />Not trying to defend hushmail. Just trying to get to the bottom of who is actually the best to go with now that I&#039;m done with tormail.
