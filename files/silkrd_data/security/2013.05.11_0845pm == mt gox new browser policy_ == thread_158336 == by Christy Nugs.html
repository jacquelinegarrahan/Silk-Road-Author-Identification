				for past 2 day&#039;s i haven&#039;t been able to access MtGox website to find current weighted average.<br />keeps telling me i must run script and wait for response!<br /><br />is there a new Mt Gox browser policy that only allows you to view web page with script enabled and possibly cookies?<br /><br />i am (EDIT: using) a popular browser with noscript...lol&nbsp; :P

				Hi Christy Nugs, <br />I just looked at the MtGox code and it definitely requires javascript to function.&nbsp; Maybe they changed their code in recent days but I think it always required javascript.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s really no security threat in allowing mtgox.com in NoScript so I would just allow&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br />You can also find the MtGox Weighted Average in your Silk Road shopping cart.&nbsp; Just add an item to your cart, then when you browse to the cart you will see the BTC value at the bottom, this is the weighted average updated every 10 minutes from MtGox.<br /><br />edit: maybe it&#039;s not 10 minutes and SR might weight the weighted average but it&#039;s always real close.

				Fuck Mt Gox. - I wasted my first two months on SR trying to figure out all their complicated unnecessary rules. Now they want ID for withdraws I hear, and are totally in bed with LE. <br /><br />Drop them like a hot potato. - BItInstant has toughened up their system, as they&#039;ve been hit with similar attacks as SR. <br /><br />Also check out Blue Sky Traders (assuming you&#039;re in the US) - access from Tor/Onion at;<br /><br />&nbsp;http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />They work great. <br /><br />If you&#039;re just going to the site to find the current à¸¿tc price? - Then I got one easy site, that does that, and only that. Access from regular browser. Bookmark!<br /><br />www.Preev.com<br /><br />I believe they base it on Mt Gox&#039;s most recent trade rate. Sometimes they switch sources as Mt Gox has become increasingly unreliable and cumbersome.<br /><br />Been on here over a year, and that&#039;s my method. I make buys bi-monthly. 80 transactions and over 5G&#039;s spent.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Though I do change my forum name every so often. Gotta throw LE off whenever possible. Everybody should be doing this,.
