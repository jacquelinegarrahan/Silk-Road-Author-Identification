				Hi I have been on SR for awhile now and one thing that fucks me everytime is how much money gets lost/taken out by fees in converting USD to BTC. For every 1k i spend it seems like about $100 extra for that stuff. I have been trying to find a consistent CHEAP way to get BTC. Being fast is another important thing but if there is even a way where i can buy a large amount at once and save for later if that is cheaper id also be willing to do that. If anyone can help or has any input on this let me know!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Td

				For a limited time all cash transactions ie Western union,Moneygram, bank wire or other e-currencies are fee free for a limited time just do not mention SR. <br />Current selling price for bits is only $4.99us<br /><br />&nbsp;http://wm-center.com <br /><br />Read about it here&nbsp; &nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25325.20<br /><br />Scroll down to bottom of page.

				$USD &gt; Your bank &gt; Dwolla.com &gt; MtGox &gt; $BTC<br /><br />Some people worry about their coins possibly being connected to their bank account through Dwolla, but I doubt that would ever get anyone in trouble unless they were moving huge volume. Dwolla charges $.25 per transaction, and MtGox is something like .6%.

				I&#039;d love the answer for this also.<br />I used mtgox first but ended up getting my account flagged and they wouldnt release my btc until I sent ID to verify my account. that defeats the whole anonymous thing. It took me a week to finally get my money &amp; it scared me from using them again.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d love to find an easy, cheap way to get bitcoins. The vendors on SR do charge a bit but they are fast and easy and its basically anonymous so much less worry and you can get btc in minutes to a few hours (depending on seller) if you REALLY want to buy something right away and cant wait days to get btc. They send btc directly to your SR wallet ready to spend.<br />&nbsp;<br />You are basically paying them for the convience and to get your btc FAST.

				Why cant you use wm-center.com and use moneygram, etc? That seems cheap, easy, and fast.

				Even when using WM-center you&#039;ve still got to get money to them via moneygram or WU, which charge their own fees. I was looking to buy 150 worth of bitcoins and while wm-center wont charge any money i was still looking at over 5% from the WU.
