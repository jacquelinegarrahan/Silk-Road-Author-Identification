				It seems these reload type cards (Vanilla, Moneypak, etc) are the way to go if you want to get BTC quickly and *anonymously*.&nbsp; The only other options I can find require a visit to a bank teller, customer service desk or waiting on snail mail.&nbsp; That or get into fake IDs, fake Paypal accounts and the like...<br /><br />So, I&#039;ve noticed in my town that these reload cards are really hard to find.&nbsp; I&#039;ve checked Targets, Walmarts, gas stations and drug stores.&nbsp; It turns out that gift cards and prepaid debit/phone cards are all the rage these days.&nbsp; All the stores I checked carry these things.<br /><br />But - only 1 chain of stores carry the reload cards.&nbsp; And they carry several types.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not name the chain but has anyone else noticed this?<br /><br />If you check my posts, I have a couple of Paranoid Theories on the Newbie thread.&nbsp; Here comes another one:<br /><br />Let&#039;s assume local LE and the feds realize BTC buyers are being driven out of the shadows as I described above.&nbsp; And that they realize anonymous BTC buying frequently leads to SR.&nbsp; If so, funneling buyers to one chain of stores would be a great way to track them down, no?&nbsp; <br /><br />For example, let&#039;s say Bob&#039;s Drug in Cheyenne, WY.&nbsp; LE could work through the other retailers (or, hell, why not Vanilla and those guys?) and ask them not to sell reload packs anywhere except for Bob&#039;s in Cheyenne.&nbsp; Since there are cameras every damn where, it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to flag those transactions and pull the tapes, possibly even get a shot of the parking lot &amp; plate of the customer&#039;s car as they leave.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing there aren&#039;t a whole lot of sales on these.<br /><br />From there, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Maybe they try to match names to faces (not too hard in 2013 right?) and then start watching peoples homes and mailboxes.<br /><br />Or, if nothing else, let&#039;s say a local drug bust happens.&nbsp; It would be super easy to match the suspect to a tape of her buying a reload pack, thereby strengthening the case that much more.<br /><br />Anyway... Paranoid Theory over.&nbsp; Time to take a Xanex.&nbsp; Back to my original question, are peeps in the US able to find these pretty easily at multiple locations in your area?

				Tldr I guess.&nbsp; Bump with the short version:<br /><br />Anyone out there having a hard time finding Reload type cards (Vanilla, etc)?&nbsp; If not, are they typically just in one chain of stores or all over the place -- in your town?
