				How safe is it to leave some sum of bc in your SR wallet. Im thinking I need to do this to an extent because while waiting around for my bitcoins to transfer through everything the product I want always sells out. (IE all of you are acid hogs). I think I read that you shouldnt do this but am wondering the general consensus was for doing this.

				i leave a deacent amount of coins in my acct. just in case sumthing catches my eye, and ive never had any issues. one thing to consider tho is that dont have any more money tied up n any of this that you cant afford to lose. i havent really heard much about accts. getting hacked till recently but i suppose anythings possible. i suppose the only major downfall of keeping a stocked acct. would be on the awfull possibility that the site closed and your money goes with it but if that dreadfull day ever comes it would be out of everyones control. there have been plenty of times tho when having sum coins sitting paid off because i scooped up some listings that would of sold out while i waited for my coin exchange. youll just have to personally weigh out the pros and cons of it.

It would only take an hour or so for the funds to be sent from there to your SR account?<br /><br />V.

				On the SETTINGS page in your SR acct there is a place to put a BACKUP BITCOIN ADDRESS.&nbsp; They say it is a place where your btc would be sent if SR is ever shut down unexpectedly.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know for sure that it will work but it&#039;s a really good idea if you keep any coins in your SR wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you haven&#039;t done this already everybody should put one in.

				@ vlad1m1r <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;honestly i didnt know how to do that sort of thing. thanks for the tip though i did not even know that you can transfer coins off SR. ill be checking into that and try to set one up. <br /><br />@jackstraw<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thanks friend! im sure this will put some minds at ease. these forums are such an asset to the site, with out helpful tips like that the less techy people or plain computer ignorant folks like myself would have a much harder time navigating the road. <br /><br /><br />its nice that we have people in this community who take the time to guide others in the right direction.<br />

				Thanks V. and Jackstraw. Also, dman I kind of feel you. This site/vendors seem like a gamble so why not just gamble with all the money you are willing to spend on here and dont put anymore money then you are willing to lose.<br />
