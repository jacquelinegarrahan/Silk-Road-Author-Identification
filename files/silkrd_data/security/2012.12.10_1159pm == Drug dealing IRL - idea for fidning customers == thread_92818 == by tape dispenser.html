				How risky do you think this idea is or likely to get any IRL drug buyers?&nbsp; <br /><br />Search craigslist for posts/ads/whatever with &#039;420 friendly&#039; and similar wording.&nbsp; Pick the ones that seem least likely to be LE trolling for prostitution/stolen goods busts and email them (via tormail address) asking if they&#039;re interested in purchasing weed, x, or other psychedelics.

People who are too paranoid to order from international vendors (which financially only works out for a few drugs here), that of course limits my market to only people in my country.&nbsp; Also that niche market may already be pretty well saturated anyway.<br /><br />Also some initial investment costs with selling on SR - good vac/heat sealing equipment, packing/shipping materials, and other misc items to increase stealth.&nbsp; Not good because I am broke as shit, can&#039;t exactly get even a teeny tiny bank loan for this.

				Grow you some shrooms. Depending on what you already have around the house, it&#039;ll cost you maybe $100 to $200 to get everything you need (rob a bank if you don&#039;t have the money), but mushrooms are a lot easier to grow discreetly than pot. You don&#039;t need to buy or store any big, hot lights or conspicuous-for-someone-like-you gardening equipment.<br /><br />You&#039;d have to get quite a few projects going at once to turn a real profit, but it&#039;s surprisingly easy. Nothing like seeing that first burst of mycelium in the jar...

				Yep, The Shroomery.<br /><br />The &quot;tek&quot; most people start out with is the PF Tek, because you don&#039;t need a pressure cooker to do it. Basically you pack a damp mixture of brown rice flour and vermiculite into little glass jars to make &quot;cakes&quot;, which you then sterilize with steam, inoculate with spores, allow to colonize, then &quot;birth&quot; into a terrarium and watch the magic happen. (Though like I said, seeing the white, cottony mycelium race across the side of the jar for the first time is almost more magical than seeing the fruiting bodies [mushrooms] themselves.)<br /><br />The spores themselves contain no psilocybin and are legal everywhere but I think Idaho, Georgia and California. I&#039;m sure there are reputable spores vendors on SR, but I have to point out there are several clearnet sites that been selling spores for over a decade- PM me and I can recommend one. Might be a better idea to go with an SR vendor for anonymity purposes though. Your call.<br /><br />All the steps of the PF Tek are demonstrated in this 4 part series on YouTube (!): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHJQrsZFQdE<br /><br />A good written guide with pictures: https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/15223324/fpart/1/vc/1<br /><br />Literally every question you might think of has been asked on the Shroomery forums, so search first because they tend to be less patient with repeated questions than people here.<br /><br />Winter is a good time to start growing mushrooms because there are less potential contaminants swirling through the air than in the warmer seasons. Get to it! ;)<br />

				i mean you could. common sense would probably protect you. people are pretty lax about weed where I&#039;m from though.<br /><br />around 6-7 years ago i actually sold a decent amount of bud to ppl IRL that i met on forums. It was centered around &quot;meeting up to smoke&quot; though.<br /><br />boy i sure was inexperienced and paranoid. but it worked. I had one regular customer that paid $140 per 7 grams and bought once a week. A surburban house wife paid $120/7g regularly. One younger college aged kid paid $350-$400 for an ounce.<br /><br />you see, the people that seek drugs in that way really have no other way / source. Thats pretty good for drug dealers. Lots of people from certain walks of life seemed to have more difficulty finding good consistant sources. or picked up smoking again later in life<br /><br />it built up a great network and you can do well selling bud if you&#039;re in your late teens to early 20s. It&#039;s safer and more acceptable than other drugs :) <br /><br />the key is to just make friends and be cautious.<br /><br />oh wait that was 7 years ago just use sr TLDR

				Man I tried to grow a few jars of shrooms once using the PK Tek I think.&nbsp; I tried to keep things clean but they all ended up contaminated with red, green &amp; black shit &amp; I had to throw them out although they did all grow mycellium.&nbsp; I&#039;d try a method that uses a pressure cooker or some other stereilization equipment if I did it again, it&#039;s such a fucking drag to have to throw it all out because it has potentially toxic molds &amp; bacteria growing all over it.

That&#039;s why I did ten jars the first time I did the PF Tek- one contaminated and two didn&#039;t grow anything at all- I think because I squirted the spores straight into the dry verm barrier. :o But I still had enough to trip for a month straight...<br /><br />They say to make sure you can nail the PF Tek before you move on. A lot of things could&#039;ve gone wrong. Did you steam sterilize the jars for a full 90 minutes? Wipe everything down with alcohol before inoculating? Use a glove box with gloves and a surgical mask- or least inoculate in a clean, still room, with no fans or AC running? Flame sterilize the needle between jars? Maybe the syringe or print itself was contaminated- I know Ralphsters sold me a syringe with fucking oyster mushrooms in it (lovely species, but they had to fight P. cubensis for space in the cake...)<br /><br />You can take none of these precautions and get lucky, but if everything contaminated, I&#039;d try again and go overkill with the sterile procedure this time.<br /><br />(Sorry for hijacking the thread. Still sort of relevant though, assuming we&#039;re all selling shrooms...)

And it&#039;s nice that you don&#039;t need a dedicated grow area. There is a bit of simple chemistry involved, which seems like something I could manage to fuck up.&nbsp; Also, ordering mimosa root bark makes me more nervous than purchasing spores because, although they&#039;re both clearly going to be used to make drugs, mimosa root bark actually contains DMT while Psilocybe spores contain no psilocybin.<br /><br />Anyway, even if DMT extraction were easier, I think the demand for shrooms is far greater and would still go with them. <br /><br />Would love to hear from anyone who&#039;s successfully extracted DMT though. The only thing I know about mimosa extraction involves orange juice and champagne.&nbsp; ;D

				I have experience extracting DMT. There was a time before the dawn of SR that I badly wanted to experience this psychedelic. I looked everywhere for it for over a year and I finally just said fuck it and made it myself.<br /><br />Its actually an extremely easy extraction process. So easy a little kid could do it. Its a billion times easier than trying to grow indoor bud and a hell of a lot less time consuming.<br /><br />But then again, I did graduate with a B.S. in Chemistry so..... <br /><br />But now that I have discovered this drug heaven, I would definitely just order from a DMT vendor.

				Ya if you have never done it before, I highly suggest doing it at least once. It will be an experience you will never forget. And I wouldnt even mess around with small doses. Just go with the breakthrough doses (50-60mg). Thats where the action is.<br /><br />Ya Elvis looks pretty good. 1/2 gram for $80 is plenty.

				Well when I was smoking it, my friend had a valcano so I would use that. Definitely the best and easiest way to breakthrough. I have tried using a normal piece a couple times with the DMT in between some vaped weed but I had a hard time getting anywhere close to a breakthrough.<br /><br />I have heard that using a meth pipe is a good way to breakthrough, so if you cant find a volcano or another good vaporizer, I would definitely try that.

				The 3 people I get oxycodone from I met through craigslist or another similar site.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also sold NBOME and DMT to people through craigslist. We email, text and talk on the phone before anything and they&#039;re usually willing to pay the most. I&#039;m talking $50/hit of DMT or $100 for a 10-strip of 25i. Not once did I say it was LSD either :)<br />Honestly I&#039;ve never had issues with LE, but I have decided not to meet up with a handful of people cause of bad vibes.<br /><br />Once you get a lot of customers you can also remove your ads and work with what you got to stay safe.

We email, text and talk on the phone before anything and they&#039;re usually willing to pay the most. I&#039;m talking $50/hit of DMT or $100 for a 10-strip of 25i. Not once did I say it was LSD either :)<br />Honestly I&#039;ve never had issues with LE, but I have decided not to meet up with a handful of people cause of bad vibes.<br /><br />Once you get a lot of customers you can also remove your ads and work with what you got to stay safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />May I ask the basic set-up of making an ad like that? Primarily I made my connections from my time in college ( knowing like 5 people who enjoy drugs that were my friends, and then letting them connect me with their friends from back where they live ) which netted me a good amount of money but at the cost of me having to drive 3 hours to get to their area. I mean, I make enough with their business to give me decent profit, but driving 6 hours in a day is taxing regardless of how much money you make. <br />

If too much water, even by say 15ml, it will be too moist and grow bad mold. Too little and you will hardly yield if at all. <br /><br />Second is like another said. Maybe wasn&#039;t sterilized long enough in the steamer. I have never used a pressure cooker to sterilize. Just a large pot with lid. I have ruined some cakes by getting too much extra water in jars while steaming....due water being too high in pot and bubbling excess water into my jars. <br /><br />I have never sterilized using alcohol though, everything has been fine. Once you get a system down you will rarely lose a cake.

				you multiply your chances of being caught exponentially by marketing to randoms. Keep a tight circle, and let word of mouth do your advertising for you. Moving your shit at $5 or $10 below market price won&#039;t hurt either.
