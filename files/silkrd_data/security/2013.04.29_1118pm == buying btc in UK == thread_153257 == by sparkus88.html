				I&#039;m looking for somewhere to buy btc online, not OTC. I had been using blockchain but they aren&#039;t taking deposits from uk anymore. Also found bitbargain.co.uk but most of the sellers have a minimum buy of 20+ btc, i&#039;m only wanting a few at a time with these prices. The only ones with lower min orders have stupidly high prices. Anyone got any suggestions?

				I&#039;ve bought single and half bitcoins on bitbargain. In fact, that&#039;s the only place I&#039;ve bought them. Unfortunately, as you say, the prices tend to be a bit high, like, I paid I think 112 pounds/bitcoin for 3 recently (they were at around 100 on mtgox).<br /><br />I just looked there, and the prices don&#039;t seem that bad, except no-one is online. I can&#039;t recommend anywhere else, unfortunately.

				Just as a matter of interest, why not #bitcoin-otc or #bitcoin-otc-uk?<br /><br />You could always do the AML thing with MtGox and do euro bank transfer, but it will cost you about twenty quid.

				Urgh, such a headache acquiring BTC in the UK atm, WTF???<br /><br />Bitbargain is a total rip off!!! Their prices have stabilized as of late but a couple of weeks ago it was like 30%+ the price it was on mtgox, daylight fucking robbery.<br /><br />I bought some BTC form an SR vendor at a 10% commission rate, just search for them on SR, there are many. Most charge a 15% fee but I found one that charged only 10%.<br /><br />PayPal where art thou?!?!!?

				Plenty on e-bay!!!<br /><br />Risky as fuck though - I guess washing the dirt from them before sending them to your SR address could work??<br /><br />I must admit, while completely off my tits I did purchase 1 coin from a vendor on e-bay and sent them to a different wallet, before washing them and putting them into SR....I was off my tits at the time and probably wouldn&#039;t advise it, and I wouldn&#039;t of done it if I was straight!!<br /><br />I did get the coin in less than 10 minutes though.<br /><br />Just remember be vigilant - which I clearly wasn&#039;t that night. But as far as I&#039;m aware buying Bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, it&#039;s what you do with them that is!!!

				£140!!! Seriously WTF!<br /><br />I think I paid about £88 at the time, which was expensive but I was rolling hard and went in recklessly!! I won&#039;t be doing it again though. I find bitbargain to be good. Not too bad prices either and so easy and quick to use.

				Another vote for bitstamp.net ****EDIT*** See this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151666 It looks like bitstamp may not be secure at all ***EDIT***<br /><br />You will have to transfer Euros to a European bank account, and your bank will charge you for this but it doesn&#039;t take too long.<br /><br />In a rush with money to burn? Try From One To Another on SR. 15% commission but they are fast as fook. I had BTC in my SR wallet within 10 minutes of the money transfer. great stuff when SR is up and down like a yo-yo.

				I haven&#039;t heard of bitstamp.net before, will check it out.<br /><br />It&#039;s great to be able to acquire BTC on eBay as I can imagine it&#039;s really fast so I will defo keep that on my radar for future reference. Might be the lucky sod to get loads of BTC from an auction at a decent price!

				If you guys are doing SEPA transfers to Bitstamp or Mt Gox, &lt;&lt;&lt;CLEARNET&gt;&gt;&gt; https://transferwise.com &lt;&lt;&lt;CLEARNET&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; will do it for £1, which is definitely cheaper than your bank!

				Thanks guys, this is thread is quite helpful.<br /><br />Does the fact that it&#039;s so difficult to get bitcoins at the moment suggest some sort of&nbsp; a conspiracy against crypto-currencies by the major UK banks and financial institutions?<br /><br />Seems they&#039;ve been cracking down on all the convenient means of payment.

				localbitcoins.com is okay. Similar to bitbargain - It sucks that these rip off sites are now our only option doesnt it :| I miss blockchain. <br /><br />Why did they stop selling to the UK? I remember reading something about fraud problems.. Anyone shed some light?

				@ pakchoi23<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been using bitbargain and it is so quick and easy, and depending who is online selling them you can get some very good prices too.<br /><br />From Bitbargain to my storage account to SR in about 1 hour 15 minutes.... Ideal.

				I guess it just depends if you&#039;re lucky enough to have a good vendor at the time you look. I got 2 BTC&#039;s for £151 earlier - over the mtgox rate, but I can&#039;t be bothered with all the waiting about for mtgox, their service is shocking (including their customer service). I did use to use mtgox before it went under for a while - but in reality they&#039;re a bunch of useles time wasting fukwits.<br /><br />The busier bitbargain is the better the price you&#039;ll get - but like I say, it&#039;s not going to be too cheap as the vendors have to pay their fee&#039;s per sale etc etc. I just like it because it is seriously quick to get coins in and out. I&#039;m not exactly rich but I&#039;m impatient and don&#039;t mind spending a little extra for an instant service. But I guess if you&#039;ve got time to wait and not much money then mtgox will always be better.<br /><br />I just like the idea of if I&#039;m shopping on SR and I&#039;m a couple of bitcoins short for what I need I can get them nice and quick. Even if you&#039;re 0.1 short you can just buy that measly amount.<br /><br />But as I say it&#039;s potluck who is on vending at the time...plus all the recent fluctuation doesn&#039;t help as vendors aren&#039;t sure whether to stick or sell low, and run the risk of the prices rising again.<br /><br />

				Could also try speedybitcoins.co.uk but will need an invite and support is not so quick off the ball to send it. Prolly take a few days but once set-up is real easy to purchase for low commission. Only problem is you don&#039;t see the prices.<br /><br />Otherwise, SEPA transfer or localbitcoins which i believe has better rates than bitbargain. You will obviously pay a premium but for a quick and easy transaction, it&#039;s the place to go. <br /><br />There&#039;s also bitcoinary and Ripple (launching properly soon). Worth checking out anyways. Good luck!

				Looks like it may be unwise to use bitstamp . net&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Read this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151666<br /><br />It explains that some people have had their accounts flagged as being associated with IP addresses connected to unlawful activity.<br /><br />Not a risk worth taking.
