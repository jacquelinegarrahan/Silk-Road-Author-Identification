				I decided to write some tutorials on how to use PGP and eventually other things, since there&#039;s so much confusion about these things.<br /><br />The first one I wrote is for GPG4USB. I kept it deliberately concise so people are more likely to read it, while pointing out common misconceptions, stumbling blocks, etc., and giving tips that I&#039;ve learned along the way (bigger key size, etc).<br /><br />You can find it here<br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Other stuff that I&#039;m planning is on the main page.

				Beautiful, excellent work and very easy to follow.&nbsp; This guide will help anyone who takes the time to use it.&nbsp; Thanks, astor, you are such an asset to the community!<br /><br />This comes at a good time, I was reading a post by Nightcrawler this morning where he says estimates are that between 75 and 90%&nbsp; of buyers on SR do NOT use encryption. The information came from SR vendors.&nbsp; I would have bet money that those figures would have applied to buyers who DO use encryption, certainly not the other way around -

				Thanks! :)<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;ve seen the thread where the vendors say 80-90% of their buyers don&#039;t use encryption. It&#039;s sad. They could read through my tutorial in 10 minutes.

				[REDACTED from wrong thread; edit.]<br /><br />I know pine is missed by everyone here, but without her it’s even more important we maintain the strong security mantra at SR. Good to see PGP Club still ^ even if not quite as active. And that nomad bloodbath is back again. I won’t even bother answering the war in Asia question (yep, it’s likely), or whether U.S. is more likely to revert to protectionism (nope, it won’t) as that boat now has sailed on the igiveashitaboutyourreply meter.<br /><br />(And for godssake thecrackhead, she’s a she, not a he! Why you play with us like that lol.)<br /><br />An overdue +1 to Bungee54 for posting the link *clearnet* http://www.hacker10.com/other-computing/u-n-report-reveals-secret-law-enforcement-techniques on 2012/12/11. I think everyone new to Tor should read this, and know mistakes to avoid. <br /><br />I won’t bother asking about trusted downloads for PGP as I am sure pine or someone else will have posted that on here, but while I’m writing this I can’t very well search for it can I?<br /><br />Speaking of security, wot (web of trust) at *clearnet* http://www.mywot.com is worth a quick investigation if faced with a dubious website, and isitup at *clearnet* http://isitup.org is invaluable to Tor users who keep getting timeouts and are wondering if it’s them or the website itself. Old news to most, but new users are reminded that tormail.org at http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion provides anonymous email with no verification or archiving abilities implemented. And do I need to remind new users not to come here launched from onion.to . <br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />Edit. TY for posting PGP link. Explains it simply.
