				Here is a product I came across a while ago..<br /><br />Gets released soon and sounds like it works as described..<br /><br />The OFF Pocket tm...<br /><br />&quot;The OFF Pocket™ is a phone case that blocks all wireless signals from entering and exiting the case.<br /><br />To use the OFF Pocket™ simply place your phone inside the case and close it. Your phone is now OFF. Untrackable. Unreachable. Unbreachable.<br /><br />The OFF Pocket has been extensively tested on all major networks, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. It is compatible with all mobile phone hardware including but not limited to iPhones, Android, Blackberrys, Nokia as well as all modern phone operating systems.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Our preliminary lab tests demonstrated full shielding effectiveness for the wireless spectrum used by smartphones. We will continue testing more phones and carriers and will publish our test results during our Kickstarter launch.&quot;<br /><br />Cant be a bad thing..

				I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d trust this, given that you can get the same results from wrapping a cell phone in a few layers of tinfoil or by sticking your cellphone into a mylar pouch. Cell phone signals are weak, and can be blocked pretty easily with a layer or two of tinfoil or mylar. This doesn&#039;t mean the phone can&#039;t be traced, though, or that the container is EMP protective. <br /><br />If the OFF pocket can keep a simple radio from picking up a signal, it might have some value. If all it can do it block a cell phone signal? You might as well save some money and just use one of those mylar bags you use for shipping. :)<br />

Beyond the fact that many phones these days do not easily enable battery removal, identifying a pure off is complicated.<br /><br />“A lot of modern devices (not just phones) do have states that are somewhere in between fully on and fully off, where some circuits<br />are powered up and others are powered down,” Seth Schoen, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group that focuses on rights in the online world, explained by e-mail. (Snowden appears to be a supporter of the organization, as he was photographed with an E.F.F. sticker on his laptop.) “These modes often allow the device to wake up autonomously if certain conditions are met, such as pressing a certain key or even receiving certain data over the Internet on a wired Ethernet connection (known as ‘wake-on-LAN’).”<br /><br />Battery removal can be equally deceptive. Even once one figures out how to extract the primary battery, there may be additional power sources within the apparatus. “Some phones use an additional battery for memory management; it’s unclear whether this battery could be used by logging and/or tracking systems such as Carrier IQ,” Mr. Harvey explained, referring to software that monitors mobile phone users.&quot;
