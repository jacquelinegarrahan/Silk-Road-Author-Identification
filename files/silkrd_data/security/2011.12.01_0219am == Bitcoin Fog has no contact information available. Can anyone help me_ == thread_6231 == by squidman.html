				I had split up part of my mtgox bitcoins into two instawallets (the exact amount to make a purchase), then into four. I deposited three of those into bitcoinfog successfully, with about an hour&#039;s worth of waiting time in between each and changing the address each time. Everything went well but the last one has not shown up. I come back to check much later after sleeping and working (over twelve hours ago was the last deposit) because I figured I didn&#039;t need to wait for the last one and I planned on leaving them in there for two days anyway.<br /><br />They have it written on there that if they don&#039;t show up in two hours to contact them. Those words aren&#039;t clickable and there&#039;s no information anywhere whatsoever. Anyone have and suggestions?

				Have you checked out the following thread:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50037.40<br /><br />The threadstarter and apparent Bit Fog rep there is Akemashite Omedetou, but he hasn&#039;t been active there for three days. His profile:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=44692<br /><br />Best of luck.

				Thanks. That&#039;s one step forward I suppose, but no contact info to be found. What&#039;s annoying is he keeps suggesting people contact them if they have problems, and gives no information!!!

				Ok, I&#039;ll admit to being a complete noob but could someone tell me what this means:<br /><br />&quot;Sorry, you are not allowed to register on this forum.Open proxies are banned due to abuse&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m unable to make an account because of this, so I&#039;m unable to contact the rep (who hasn&#039;t been active for a few days anyway), but it&#039;s my only chance that I know of.

				You could try a new identity under Tor, as they may have one or two high volume exit nodes banned for abuse. Lots of forums subscribe to open proxy lists as well, and ban them as a matter of course to avoid endless spamming for fake Rolex&#039;s, pyramid schemes and penis enlargement devices.<br /><br />Or, they may import the Tor exit list and ban all Tor exit nodes, much like imgur does cause asshole kept uploading CP over Tor, so you may not be able to use Tor to register there at all.
