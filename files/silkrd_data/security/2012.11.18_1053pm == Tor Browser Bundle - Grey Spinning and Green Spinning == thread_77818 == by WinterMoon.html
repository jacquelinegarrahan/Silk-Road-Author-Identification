				I use the Tor Browser Bundle.&nbsp; There&#039;s a status thingy that changes color &amp; direction when it spins.&nbsp; At first, it is gray &amp; it spins counter-clockwise,&nbsp; Then, it turns green and starts spinning clockwise right before loading a page.&nbsp; What is Tor doing when it&#039;s spinning gray?&nbsp; What is happening when it starts spinning green?&nbsp; I obviously need the For Dummies version if anyone can explain this.&nbsp; Thanks

				You mean that thing on the tabs?<br /><br />In that case, I&#039;m using Ubuntu and Tor for Linux, and here it is orange and grey. The Tor browser has it, but regular Mozilla Firefox does too.<br /><br />It&#039;s a Firefox thing. It has to do with loading the page, but I don&#039;t know what it indicates exactly.

				Yes, the thing on the tabs. You are correct, it is a Firefox thing.&nbsp; Just curious about the mechanics of getting here, so much spinning :)<br /><br />It seems like the grey spinning is Tor trying to find some way to get me to the requested server (hailing a cab) and the green spinning is when the server has been located &amp; now I need to find a way in (waiting in line to get into a popular club) <br /><br />(shrug)<br />

				Good question, I&#039;d like to know the answer to this too.

				I asked Duck Duck Goose instead of Mozilla:<br /><br />&quot;...The Tor Network is an incredibly complicated network of servers designed to anonymize your activities on the Internet. Remember, every time you load a web page your browser sends out a request for the data on that page and returns it to your home computer. When you use Tor, that request enters the Tor Network via an entry point known as a relay. Most relays are servers running a copy of the Tor software, which encrypts the request and sends it through a random series of server relays (at least two) to confuse surveillance and frustrate anyone monitoring your Internet activity.<br /><br />Every time your request passes through a node it will remove a layer of the encryption, until at last your request hits an exit relay and proceeds out into the Internet again to request data from the web page you&#039;re trying to visit. Even if the server hosting the web page you&#039;re trying to access logs your search queries or IP, there will be no way for anyone to associate that data with your name...<br /><br />...Unfortunately, browsing the Web anonymously through Tor is still awfully slow. The problem is that every time you access a new page you have to jump through a randomly generated number of nodes in the Tor Network, and there are less than 1,000 nodes being shared amongst all Tor users...There are three kinds of Tor relays: exit relays, middle relays and relay bridges....&quot;<br /><br />Above text copied from this site + very simple diagram: http://www.techhive.com/article/235174/tor_network_1.html<br /><br />well then ...

				When it&#039;s grey, it&#039;s trying to connect to the server.<br /><br />When it&#039;s green, it has connected and is downloading the requested page.
