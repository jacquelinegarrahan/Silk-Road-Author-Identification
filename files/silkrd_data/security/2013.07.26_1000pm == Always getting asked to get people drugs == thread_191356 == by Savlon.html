				I started buying off the silk road primarily because it allowed me to connect with people who supplied drugs that weren&#039;t prevalent in the area I lived. It all went fine at first. I have done Acid and MDMA for the first time through the silk road. It was beautiful. I have literally had life changing experiences brought about by these compounds. Unfortunately for me though I have got a bit of a reputation as the guy who can get the hard to get drugs around here. Alot of people have started asking me to get them this... or sort them out. They ask me to introduce them to my dealer. I&#039;ve said everything from my dealer is part of my extended family so it&#039;s a bit dodge to my dealer doesn&#039;t want to meet any new people at the moment . Some people even ask me this shit over fucking email etc!. Thing is these people know about SR... they just don&#039;t know how to get bitcoin or use PGP or plain out dont trust it etc. It&#039;s fucked. I don&#039;t really want to supply these guys. I&#039;m not cut out to be a drug dealer nor do I particularly want to be. Fuck that. But I don&#039;t want them to go away empty handed... because I know what it&#039;s like trying to find a connect for molly or lucy. Desperately trying to find a substance that you can&#039;t obtain...<br /><br />What are your guys thoughts?<br />Ever had anything similiar?<br />Should I brush them off?<br />Or buy and sell for a profit?<br /><br />Are you in my shoes?<br />What would you do/ suggest?<br />Peace and love.<br />

				If they are stupid enough to ask you over plain email i would not recommend it.&nbsp; the reputation you already have could be a blessing and a curse if you would start selling for a profit.<br /><br />Its totally up to you, but personally i would buy some extra stuff to keep around for people you trust and sell for a profit, if they could keep quiet about where they got it from.<br /><br />Start telling people your dealer only sells to people he trusts, and that he doesnt want to expand for the time being<br /><br />Good luck and keep us updated. Im kind of in a similar situation myself.<br /><br />Cheers

				Youre in charge of the rep you get, no one else. My advice honestly is ditch the crowd your with. Who the fuck asks to meet your dealer? Bad news, thats who.<br /><br />If you want to sell, first thing youve got to realize is that your &#039;friends&#039; wont pay over the national average after they look up street prices online.&nbsp; 2nd: If you have friends rich enough for a drug habit, they are going to get dope envy when you stop supplying them.<br /><br />Its sounds like youre lost already, and havent even pissed one of them off yet.&nbsp; People love you when you share drugs. But when you become their drug store, the prices are too high, the products too bad, the layout of the store doesnt make sense,etc

				Definately cut ties with the people asking you for drugs over email. Or at the very least talk to them in person and very calmly explain why that&#039;s a really bad idea. Same goes for texts and phone conversations too. Only talk about drug deals in person.<br /><br />As far as the opinion that being asked to be introduced to the dealer is sketchy, I&#039;m going to respectfully disagree there. It all depends on who the person asking to be introduced is and the quantities involved. If its someone you barely know, then yes, that&#039;s sketchy as hell. But if its someone you&#039;ve known for a while and trust, I don&#039;t really see a problem with that, especially for personal use quantities. The bigger the quantity, of course, the bigger the sketch factor.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to be a drug dealer, then don&#039;t be a drug dealer. Don&#039;t let people pressure you into being their supplier. Stick to what you&#039;re comfortable with.<br /><br />I&#039;m also in a bit of a similar situation. Its really my fault for sharing all the awesome drugs I&#039;ve bought here on SR. If I just kept them for myself, no one would ever know. But what&#039;s the fun in that? ;) So people started to notice that I always have really amazing drugs and they are asking me where they can get some. For the most trusted friends I offer to help them get set up with PGP and bitcoins so they can start buying on SR. But its always a judgement call. Just use good judgement. :)

				I&#039;m in 100% the exact same position. I am considered &quot;that kid who can get hard drugs.&quot; People ask me often. I will help out good friends, yes, but for a random kid i don&#039;t know, i will say no.<br /><br />To people i really have a dislike for, either because they&#039;re stupid, irrational, reckless, or just plain rude, i will tell them that i&#039;m not just going to &quot;hook them up&quot; because it took me A LOT of time and research to get a good, constant, and consistent source for substances.<br /><br />On another note, don&#039;t feel bad about not getting people substances. If they really want something, they will try all of their options and eventually get what they desire.

				In respect to buying and selling for profit, here&#039;s my take:<br /><br />I have always loved sharing good moleules with people. L, DMT, Mushrooms, MDMA, MJ, really, just good entheogens, whatever the substance might be. I believe these molecules are important for humanity on a much deeper level than just for the sake of fun; and I think many people agree with me.<br /><br />The time period we live in is but a tiny slice of the entire span of the history of humanity. This period of prohibition where all drugs (except the ones manufactured for profit by pharmaceutical companies, of course) are demonized is so ridiculously incongruent with human history. Humans, different cultures, have been consuming various psychotropic substances to alter and expand their mind for thousands of years all across the world and still do so today in more removed settings from the modernized world (take ayahuasca for example or native american peyote ritual). Entheogenic substances are important. They are therapeutic, medicinal, and I believe they facilitate our evolution and spiritual development. Even in the scope of western medicine, drugs like LSD, Psilocybin, and MDMA have proven to be incomparably therapeutic for a range of disorders and illnesses. <br /><br />I believe these substances are important and helpful for many people, but many people do not have these available to them. With SR, one can supply people pure products to provide these life-changing experiences.<br /><br />However, these substances are costly. If I had piles of money, I&#039;d buy tons of this stuff and give it away to anyone willing to partake with the right intention, in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, the next best option is for one to buy and sell for profit. This way, people can have access to these beautiful molecules at a fair price, and you can continue to supply. It&#039;s not a matter of selling for profit so that you can buy a new stereo system, or take a trip to Hawaii. There&#039;s no harm in using the process to add a little more padding to your savings, but the primary motive should be to be able share these molecules to those who would otherwise have no access to them or may try to buy them from someone who is selling them a RC.<br /><br />And don&#039;t make it something where you sell to just anyone who is willing to shell out the cash. Be selective, in a reasonable way, and use your instincts as well. Mostly, sell to friends or people you feel comfortable with and around; you know, not people you feel are going to take the stuff and then stomp all over it and resell it. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable with a person, like they give off a negative vibe or they do things you are uncomfortable with (like asking for things through email, or being pushy or nosey etc.) then just don&#039;t sell to them, simple as that. I know the feeling of not wanting someone to go empty handed, but if they aren&#039;t showing you that they can be mature, discreet, and genuine, then you have nothing to feel bad about.<br /><br />Anyways, I know that was a lot, if you read it, I hope it was helpful.

				I hear you my friend and understand you totally.<br />The are 2 options, make profit and teach them (to your close friends) how to use SR.<br /><br />I was also afraid of this situation and I think I really did a smart move. I told my my friends (or at least those who I could make a profit) that I have a friend in another city and can send me anything. &quot;He is my friend and I can get them free or at least really cheap for myself. If you want I can tell him to send me the X drug you want, but he is expensive&quot;<br /><br />I always charge double for two reasons. First is to avoid buying stuff for others (not into dealing but still I manage to pay all my orders by my friends money :) ) and second because the market supply is really zero and they can&#039;t find. &quot;That&#039;s the price my friend, I know he is expensive but he has everything and in good quality&quot;<br /><br />Hehe.<br />All is up to you. If you tell them no I can&#039;t they will eventually stop bothering you if you don&#039;t want to fix them with substances.<br /><br />All the best my friends.<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />&nbsp;

You&#039;re dealing, out in the real world, where there is no such thing as anonymity. Very, very risky.<br /><br />Friends, and even relatives, will 9 times out of 10 save their own skin even if they risk yours. This true story (with names disguised) should be an object lesson to all. It&#039;s the very reason I will never transact except on the Road, where my anonymity is guaranteed:<br /><br />A friend of mine, call her Rosie, had a legitimate nursery. She grew flowers and trees, had 3 or 4 greenhouses, all legit. She realized, like Nancy Botkin, how much more money she could make by throwing down a few cannabis seeds.<br /><br />She followed certain strict rules. ONLY sell to family, and friends she had known for eons.<br /><br />She sold, for example, to her daughter, and her daughter&#039;s husband of many years.<br /><br />One year, the daughter got a divorce. Out of anger the husband vindictively turned Rosie in.<br /><br />By way of epilogue, the cops took every dime Rosie had. She lawyered up and beat a horrible rap, but she was left with no means of an income and no money. It would have been far, far worse to go to prison.<br /><br />I get the impression that folks around here have never stepped foot in an actual prison. One day of it will make you pay any price to avoid it.<br /><br />Walk with care, folks. Don&#039;t deal. Not even to your grandma. Faced with the option of jailtime or turning your ass in, what choice will grandma make? What about that friend you&#039;ve known for a year, what choice will he make?<br /><br />If you must be generous, be nice and share your drugs. But once you exchange drugs for money you&#039;re a dealer, and the person you sold to has evidence of that. And what do you gain? Folks saying about you &quot;he was such a sweet guy before he fell!&quot;

				Giving SR vendor his address and having it posted there vastly reduces your risk as yu never touch the goods.&nbsp; If domestic, this is almost guaranteed delivery.&nbsp; Additionally these guys are desperate for drugs so will unlikely scam you when they get great stuff as they will be so happy.&nbsp; Charge a premium and collect payment in cash.&nbsp; I agree the guy who emailed you has kinda fucked you.&nbsp; Weed out the morons but can make a bit of pocket change this way.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you find someone trustworthy enough you cold sell them bulk and make decent profits whilst they take all the risk.&nbsp; Dealer by proxy.

				@zazoo: that´s exactly what i would suggest!<br /><br />You pick out the trustworthiest of them and have an intense dialog about not telling anybody anything about where to get the stuff!!<br />1. Then you only deal with that guy and he can do the work (and earn a little money - and you too of course!).<br />If there´s only one action you don´t like (or you hear sth about) you will immediately stop dealing with him!<br />He should feel like he gets a very special offer (that it is)!<br /><br />Or you pick out the trustworthiest of them and have an intense dialog about not telling anybody anything about where to get the stuff!!<br />2. Let him give you the money in advance and order on SR. Let the stuff send to his adress and tell him the story about a good connection in another city. He takes the risk of course! (If it comes to a seizure, your dealer was soooo nice to resend 50% or he gives a bonus at the next order).<br /><br />Don´t meet this guy where other people can see you!<br />Nobody should have a proof of a connection between you and him!<br /><br />Maybe some will speculate about you and him, but if there´s no proof, they can just speculate!!<br /><br />In any case avoid to deal with more than one of them!!<br /><br />Or 3. you just enjoy YOUR stuff and let them try themself to get THEIR stuff...<br /><br />That sounds maybe selfish, but that´s no kindergarten - there´s jail in view!!<br /><br />My few satoshi´s

				I definitely get this problem all the time... I&#039;m not the type of guy who keeps the silkroad secret, i think it should be enjoyed by everyone although no one i has ever told has actually used it themselves... pussys.<br /><br />Anyway so i always used to tell my mates the epic deals i could get, which in turn would end up in them wanting me to order it for them for little extra, like $10 on the top.<br /><br />So i did this maybe 10 times and then i started telling them that i was getting all these epic deals from international and whatnot, and then a couple weeks later i told them that none of them came through and that SR is heaps risky.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a package go missing haha, so these days i charge them a premium and instead of ordering what they want, i order what i want and sell from that. half the time they think i get it from IRL sources anyway<br /><br />
