				Instawallet has been having a lot of issues lately. The last time I used it, my bitcoins didn&#039;t show up for 24 hours because they were having issues with their bitcoin client (and their customer support is basically non-existent). I just deposit directly into my SR wallet now.

I&#039;ve never really had any problems with instawallet though, the one time i did i messaged support and was responded to within a few hours.(could of been lucky) I haven&#039;t used them for about 2 weeks though so i don&#039;t know whats up. As of right now it isn&#039;t loading on tor for me, but clearnet works fine.

				I&#039;ve used InstaWallet many times and never had any issues, never lost any coins.<br /><br />I also used TorWallet.net a few times before it was identified as a scam, but I never lost any coins there, either. I was one of the lucky ones, I guess.<br /><br />These things could turn scam at any time so I just don&#039;t use them for more coins than I can afford to lose.

Later on they come back crying on the forums about how they were scammed (usually moneypak to bitcoin).<br /><br />They just don&#039;t want to know that they are going to be scammed. That is why I think that people like that were simply born to be harvested by scammers like TheTeflonDon. It is the reason for their existence.
