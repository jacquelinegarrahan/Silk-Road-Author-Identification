				I personally use CampBX and Dwolla to buy Bitcoins. Check out the buyer&#039;s guide here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide

				Basically,<br /><br />1. Create a Dwolla account and link to your bank account. This takes several business days. Then you use Dwolla to transfer money from your bank account to your CampBX account, which takes several more business days.<br /><br />2. On CampBX you can buy BTC with the funds you transferred in from Dwolla. BTC are deposited into your CampBX wallet. <br /><br />3. Transfer your BTC from your CampBX wallet to your SR wallet and buy drugs.<br /><br />Keep in mind CampBX has a dumb new rule where Dwolla accounts have to be at least 30 days old to be used.

				Here&#039;s a quick guide that I&#039;ve been using. Message me if you need detailed info, it&#039;s all fairly straightforward though. Enjoy!<br /><br />Buy BTC using BitInstant (they have a lot of deposit options, I&#039;ve deposited at a bank and used Moneygram without any problems. Info that you provide to Moneygram can be made up.). Use the option to receive bitcoins as a BTC address and have it sent to your throwaway email account.<br />Create an email account, I used secure-mail.biz<br />Walkthrough the steps to deposit money with BitInstant. Put in a local zip code and it&#039;ll give you a list of stores/banks where you can go to deposit. Put in fake credentials for the info, print out the form, deposit the cash, and if all goes well you should have the BTC address sent to your email within a couple hours, it could take longer so don&#039;t worry.<br />From here you can either send the funds straight in to SR or send them to Coinapault and then SR.<br /><br />BitInstant takes I think %4 for the service so its always a good idea to deposit a bit more than what your buying costs, not to mention the value of BTC goes all over the place.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not familiar with buying BTC other than depositing cash in person. I think there&#039;re some services that let you hook up a bank account, maybe Dwolla? It takes a few days for every transaction though.
