				I was on Onion.core in the talk section, and there was a recent thread citing an FBI informant close to the Silk Road operators.<br />Sorry if this has been posted before, it was the resent date (last few days that drew may attention). Plus I&#039;m getting closer to that magic 100 post.<br /><br />The OP stated; <br />&#039;The FBI cited Exemption (b)7(d) in that case, which excludes from disclosure &quot;records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes which could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source and information furnished by a confidential source.&quot;.&#039;<br /><br />He went on to say that he believes the informant is close to someone actually running this site. This my worst fear. I personally think the two most realistic ways of shutting down Silk Road are: [1] DPR or his close team are grassed up (ratted on) by someone close to them, and unless they have a lightning fast backup plan for a raid of homes and/or offices, this would likely be the end for them. And [2] governments legislate against anonymous Bitcoin purchasing (not hard), this wouldn&#039;t affect bitcoins themselves, just the ease of obtaining them anonymously.<br /><br />I really hope for DPR sake he doesn&#039;t live in the USA. It&#039;s one of the only countries with the time, money and resources (and that even cares enough) to pull off the kind of operation to tackle Silk Road. DPR come live in England, are police are facing 30% cuts to their numbers and having their budgets slashed. There was an article in The Sun (a huge paper here) about Silk Road and the public didn&#039;t bat an eyelid. Or maybe some other European country with better laws to protect the individual and leaner sentences (Netherlands). I&#039;m no expert, but I wouldn&#039;t want to get caught in the USA (mind, you could get extradited!).<br /><br />I&#039;m sure DPR has already considered this and knows more about it than me. I just love this place, not only for the drugs, but it has one of the best community groups on the forum anywhere.<br /><br />I&#039;m rambling, I&#039;ve done to much coke :o amongst other things :-[, I&#039;ll shut up.<br /><br />PS. They gave Silk Road until 2013 in this forum (blah!), I have another thread about what to do if it does get shut down (the old Hydra method). Night all. ;)

				DPR wouldn&#039;t care, even if they raided his house right now do you think he keeps Silk Road papers all over the place and the servers under his bed? Of course not, the servers are located in Russia hosted by some dodgy anonymous host and everything is done remotely, the law enforcement can&#039;t do anything.<br /><br />The worst the law enforcement could do, which they have been known to do in the past is commission people to flood the site with DDOS attacks or discredit the site&#039;s reputation by constantly doing scams etc here.

				I&#039;m curious how you know SR servers are in Russia? Maybe DPR does have the server under his bed. Maybe DPR is some high school kid with the server in his parents basement. Maybe the DEA has an undercover agent posing as his prom date. You really have no idea about the level of security that DPR is actually using, so it is best to assume that he is using nothing at all (other than Tor obviously).

				The point I was making is that just because those Russian servers are available anonymously and it is common knowledge does NOT mean that DPR is using one. The fact is that YOU have ZERO idea what he is actually using, and it is ignorant to claim that you do. I operate as if DPR will be compromised tomorrow with everything I do on here, and it is just lazy to operate any other way. I for one would NOT be signing up for a Tor bridge run by DPR for silk road customers.

				I think the most hilarious thing about this thread is.......out of all the talk of encryption and hiding files on this forum and so forth..... people actually assume DPR takes few precautions. LOL.<br /><br />I pretty sure it&#039;s safe to assume that someone who is smart enough to build/maintain this site is more than capeable than 99% of the people on this forum to take precautions to protect his wellbeing.<br /><br />Do people not realize what it&#039;s like for him? I can only take a guess, but If I was running one of the biggest underground drug trafficking sites on the network, and be smart enough to maintain it for this long... I would take every precaution including multiple failsafes incase one thing or another goes wrong. It seems to be common sense... or else do you really think he would have made it this far..?-.-<br /><br />I seriously doubt he is just some druggy who has maintained this site by pure luck.... Not to mention, the dude is probably a millionaire. I mean, with all the Fees vendors are charged and the massive amounts of money moved on this site. Chances are he makes tens of thousands a week, but in my opinion that is a lowball number.<br /><br />DPR is not a fool. I&#039;d go as far to brand him a genius.

				I&#039;ve been on here pretty much from jump st, and all I have is respect for DPR and whoever runs this site.&nbsp; As a libertarian who has paid hard prices for his beliefs this is the one true hope for those of us who believe no government has the right to legislate what goes in my body.&nbsp; Silk Road and all who chart her course are my heroes.&nbsp; Paranoia and speculation are fun, but the truth is we know nothing.&nbsp; The simple fact that site is alive and healthy shows how little outside forces can do...and when I just think of them trying to bring any sort of reasonable case to a jury...and explain bitcoins?&nbsp; hahaha....have fun, LE, but DPR is drinking umbrella drinks in some caribbean island ... no worries...

Nobody provides you with a .onion domain you generate a public keypair and the .onion you have is based on that. Any server in the fucking world can run a site like SR, it isn&#039;t like he had to use bitcoins to pay for it.<br /><br />That said Russians do have some nice bulletproof hosting services. But I highly doubt SR is hosting with heihachi or 2X4. And last I check they are not underground, but are going on rants about how interpol can suck their dicks to people complaining to their abuse departments lol.
