Current trading is based on several factors: <br /><br />1. Greed<br />2. irrational exuberance (Greenspan quote)<br />3. blind enthusiasm <br />4. Total ignorance<br /><br />The esoteric concept of a digital currency can only be appreciated and implemented by the bold and the brave. Not your average Joe/Jane. <br />Last time I checked, the bold were engaged in a snooze-fest and the brave were out to lunch. <br /><br />Stay away from GOX! manipulation extraordinaire!<br /><br />jus&#039; sayin&#039; <br /><br /><br /><br />
