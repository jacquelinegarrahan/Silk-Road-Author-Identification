				Do you think getting &#039;Postage Underpaid&#039; note from the post office should ring alarm bells? <br />You can pay the fine remotely and they will resend but it seems a bit fishy...<br />Any idea what would happen to anything that was not resent or collected? Do they bin it? open it?<br /><br /><br />

				If the postage remains unpaid then they will return it to sender and if there is no sender on the reverse then they will bin it.<br /><br />It&#039;s not suspicious, if law enforcement were after you they wouldn&#039;t use this tactic, unpaid postage isn&#039;t admission of ownership, you don&#039;t know what someone could have posted you until you actually receive it, so there&#039;s no risk, don&#039;t worry.<br /><br />The vendor should get in shit though, it&#039;s very bad selling to do this. Very bad.

				hi again,<br />it was a small package so will not have jammed a machine. <br />i think it is probably best not to collect this order. i think doing so could connect me to the addressee - is this an argument for using your actual name on SR??????<br />if the post office will disgard stuff that doesn&#039;t get collected I would rather consider this a right off than take the (slightly higher than normal) risk trying to retrieve it.<br />now that i have decided not to collect due to my perceived extra risk, do you think i should finalize and take the loss myself or do you think the vendor should split it given the circumstances? <br />i don&#039;t want to name the vendor as it sounds like teething problems so i don&#039;t think it will happen again.<br />maybe just temporary paranoia but i think this might be the end of my days on SR... <br />cheers<br />e

Facebook is full or real name to use.. Sometimes in one country there is 50 or more people with the same name... Just don&#039;t use one like &quot;John Wayne&quot; or &quot;Tom Cruise&quot;&nbsp; :P
