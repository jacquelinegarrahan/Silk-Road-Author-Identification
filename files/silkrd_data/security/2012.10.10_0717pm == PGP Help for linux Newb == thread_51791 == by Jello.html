				I just installed Fedora 17 on my computer and am completely new to linux. Most things i was able to find and understand online but i&#039;m having trouble setting up pgp. I&#039;d like to have an application to use instead of doing it in the terminal(if possible) but if you can only use the terminal that&#039;s cool too. Also i already have a pgp key from windows, should i just create a new one?&nbsp; The main problem i have is encrypting messages, and saving keys. I&#039;d like to figure this out today hopefully. Any and all help is greatly appreciated&nbsp; ;D

				I haven&#039;t used it myself (I&#039;m very much a terminal guy,) but seahorse is the gnome frontend to gnupg, and should be pretty and easy to understand, and available from fedora&#039;s package manager.<br /><br />I expect there is general gpg info on the wiki, and there&#039;s tons on this forum, so read up, and ask when you&#039;re confused, and you&#039;ll get there!

				Thanks for the responses. I just read KmfKewm&#039;s command line tut and found it very useful. It has actually given me some motivation to learn some command line commands&nbsp; :D.
