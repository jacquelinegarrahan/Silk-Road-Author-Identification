It will ask for an email, but you should not under any circumstances use a real email. Make up one, and write down your password. <br /><br />Next, your private key will be formed. Keep it in your GPG folder for easy access, but be aware that this is the least secure manner - if your computer is raided, they will be able to decrypt your messages.<br /><br />Next, you&#039;ll get your public key. I actually lost mine, but as a buyer you don&#039;t really need it. Vendors are highly unlikely to need to send you encrypted information.<br /><br /><br />Now, with your private key set up, you need to scooop up someone&#039;s public key via the copy function. In GPG4USB, there is the option to attain public key&#039;s from your copy function, so do that. You now have a public key in your collection. Make sure that all extra toolbars and functions are checked. I nearly threw my keyboard at my monitor because I could not find where my list of public keys were! I had accidentally unchecked the box because a separate floating box can be bothersome.<br /><br />Now, in the main box, in the empty white space, write your address and keep it properly formatted or you might accidentally make a vendor work for their money. <br /><br />Now, you&#039;re going to return to that floating box, and check the mark next to the public key you wish to send an encrypted message to, and click &quot;Encrypt.&quot; After successfully doing so, you&#039;ll get the normal looking scramble with the GPG header and footer, and you must then copy that and send it to the recipient who can decrypt it, or other people if you want to fuck with them.<br /><br /><br />PM me if you need any further assistance. <br /><br />Also, we may have spoken earlier on the silk road.&nbsp; :)

				If you&#039;re going to use GPG4USB, you might as well use TAILS IMHO. Setting PGP up through TAILS is really easy. Then again I&#039;m biased. Just food for thought.

				Use GPG4USB on a TrueCrypt usb flash drive so no-one can steal your private key.<br /><br />www.truecrypt.org
