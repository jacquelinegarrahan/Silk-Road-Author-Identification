				Hey guys,<br />I&#039;m kinda high on shrooms right now, lol, but had an idea.<br />I&#039;m a programmer, and saw that some people might not have the technical skills to remove metadata from images.<br /><br />My question is, would people be interested if I set up a tor service where you can upload an image and it will process it for you, just returning an image that you can right click, save as, whatever, that&#039;s been completely scrubbed of all data? And don&#039;t worry, the original image with the data will be wiped as soon as it&#039;s processed, and as soon as it&#039;s returned to the user, the cleared image will be deleted as well. no images will be saved, and will be securely shredded after processing.<br /><br />I just like to take on stupid little coding projects while high, and thought this might be an interesting idea/tool for people to use to automate things and generally make lives easier, as well as aid in keeping things as secure/discreet as possible.<br /><br />Just wanted to get feedback, and see if people would be interested.<br /><br />Also, forgive me if this isn&#039;t the right section of the forums to post this in.

				It sounds like a good idea in theory but that would mean *you* would have the metadata for the photos in question.<br /><br />Not too sure how people would feel about that... -.^

				@zifnab - <br /><br />True. Though, with the way I&#039;d write it, it would be completely automated, and the images will be completely destroyed as soon as the script finishes.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a basis of trust, but that&#039;s how things work around here. You have to trust that I&#039;m doing what I say I am.<br />I can say up and down that I have no ill intention, and merely want to make people&#039;s experience as quick and easy as possible.<br /><br />But still, the user has to place their trust in my system that it does as it says it does.<br /><br />I really do have no intention of keeping people&#039;s pictures, or metadata, as soon as it&#039;s processed. script will accept user upload, store the image in memory, strip all the metadata except for the dimensions and color information, then return the modified image to the user&#039;s browser to save locally. as soon as the script finishes, the image and data will be gone. nothing ever hits disk.<br /><br />Sorry if this doesn&#039;t come across clear, but as I mentioned, I&#039;m rather high on shrooms, so I tried to explain things the best I could. :)<br /><br />Also, @kmfkewm, I know how lazy people can be at times, haha. this is just upload, save, done. plus, it retains all of the original photo&#039;s dimensions and filesize, some things that just hitting print screen can&#039;t.<br /><br />Also, as mentioned, this would be something fun for me to do. I just wanted to get feedback to see if people would be interested.
