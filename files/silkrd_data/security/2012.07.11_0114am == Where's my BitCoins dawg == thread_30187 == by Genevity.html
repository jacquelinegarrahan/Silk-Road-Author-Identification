				Noob here, trying to buy some nice kush. Can anyone tell me if I did anything wrong? I still don&#039;t have my BC.<br /><br />I went to bitinstant.com and selected pay from walmart and pay to bitcoin address: (my SR address)<br />Went to walmart, did the instructions, paid for 20$ worth of bitcoins<br />Got a email confirmation saying my trade has been confirmed and thank you for your transer for Bitcoin Address.<br />Been a couple hours, no Bitcoins.<br /><br />Maybe wrong address? Maybe I&#039;m just too damn impatient?<br /><br />thanks

				I did this today as well. Had mine sent to email. From email it took me to coinpult, from there I entered my SR address and the showed up in about two hours. Also 20 bucks is only about 7 btc.

				Got it finally, only $18.14 which leaves me about... 2 different options for a gram, but it&#039;ll do.<br /><br /><br />Anyone have opinions/reviews on Vlad Tepes?
