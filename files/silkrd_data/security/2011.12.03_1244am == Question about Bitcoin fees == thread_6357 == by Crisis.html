				Title: <strong>Question about Bitcoin fees</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Crisis</strong> on <strong>December 03, 2011, 12:44 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi all,<br /><br />There&#039;s an bitcoin dealer on SR that&#039;s selling without a fee. However, he&#039;s charging $3.50 per BT whose value is currently hovering around 3.10-3.12 US dollars. If my maths correct, that&#039;s roughly 8-10% extra or $8-10 dollars per every hundred dollars spent, which is consistent with the service he&#039;s providing.<br /><br />Get-BitCoin, I believe, is charging around 5-6 percent with around a week turnaround.<br /><br />While this dealer&#039;s claims of not charging a fee is correct, an upcharge is certainly being applied.<br /><br />I am in no way knocking the business or claiming it&#039;s involved in shady practices, I&#039;m just curious if my math is in anyway correct (mathematics isn&#039;t my strongest suit) and with larger transactions, say around $200-250, if fast turnaround makes up the difference in charges.<br /><br />Hope I&#039;m not being too confusing or overthinking this.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Crisis

				You&#039;re always going to pay less for BTC off-site.&nbsp; The extra you pay on the Road is for the convenience, it&#039;s always instant, and you can use cash for a Money-Pac at just about any chain store in the US (eg; walmart, right-aid, gas station.)&nbsp; Get-Bitcoin, like you said, takes about a week.&nbsp; I just went through the exact vendor you&#039;re talking about, and it went like this:<br /><br />1.Cashed my paycheck and picked up an MP on my way home from work.<br />2. Logged into SR and Pm&#039;d the vendor.<br />3. He confirmed he had the BTC, I ordered the listing, BTC in my account less than 2 hours after getting paid today.<br /><br />You just cannot beat that speed and convenience. I didn&#039;t do your math, but I wanted to place orders this weekend and not next weekend. Now I can, and I&#039;m willing to pay extra to do so.&nbsp; Now, if I were looking to buy $1000 dollars in coins, I&#039;d probably go for the best deal and wait it out.&nbsp; It&#039;s all relative to what you&#039;re trying to do and how quickly you want to do it.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re talking about BTC-Buddy, and if so I&#039;d just like to chime in that so far he&#039;s been the fastest exchanger I&#039;ve used.&nbsp; I used to go with SumYunGai, but he ran into some trouble.&nbsp; Normally I&#039;d stick with him because I&#039;m loyal like that, but he was gone so I went with Buddy, and couldn&#039;t be happier.&nbsp; It was REALLY fast!

				Thanks subtlety,<br /><br />You confirmed everything I was thinking. I just wanted some level headed advice.<br /><br />And you&#039;re correct, I was referring to BTC-Buddy. I just didn&#039;t want anyone to think I was questioning his practice or ethics. He seems to be out of BT at the moment so I was&nbsp; trying to figure out if I should wait for him to get some more in or go through Get-bitcoin. Either way, I&#039;ll be tying up cash.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice,<br />Crisis

				I&#039;ve never used them so I just assumed what crisis said was correct.&nbsp; Even so, 24 hous from them verifying, then the time to tumble to instawallets (optional, but a good idea if you do direct bank transfer, of if Get-bitcoin deposits to a personal wallet or an MtGox, Campbx, ect. account.) Then the time to go from instawallet(s) to the Road. Gonna take a lot longer than two hours from the moment you get paid.

				The one and only time I used Get-BitCoin, I paid directly with an echeck through my checking account.<br /><br />Verification of my order was immediate but it took about a day for them to reply as to where to go and pay for my order. Then it took 3 days for my bank to set up an account to pay through echeck. Then another two days or so for Get-BitCoin to process my order. So about 6-7 days total. May go faster since I have my echecking set up.<br /><br />I think Get-BitCoin now has a one day turnaround with a 3 percent surcharge. Haven&#039;t tried it. Or you can pay them direct through their account by paying cash at BOA or Chase.<br /><br />Not the speediest nor, in some people&#039;s eyes, the safest way to order bitcoins but it worked without a hitch.<br /><br />Just contacted BTC Buddy and it looks as if he has bitcoins in again. Going that route this time.<br /><br />Thanks for you help subtlety,<br />Crisis

				Just placed an order with BTC Buddy. Less than 5 minutes from placing order to finalizing. Amazing!<br /><br />Thanks for everyone&#039;s help.
