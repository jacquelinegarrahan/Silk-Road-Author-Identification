				Now that i&#039;ve been working my way up there in cash, i was curious the best ways to purchase large amounts of coins? I&#039;m talking the 10-20k range.<br /><br />Currently i&#039;ve been using LBC to get my coins. Sadly i live in bumfuck nowhere and my only option is bank deposits, except the occasional 2 hour drive to someone with coins. I have quite a few trusted people on there that are usually always in stock for Bank transfers, but i&#039;m curious of how to go about so much money. I&#039;m assuming i should just make a few small transfers and drive twon to town making different purchases to protect myself, i think usuing the same bank all the time will be a bit sketchy, i still feel sketched bringing a few k into the same bank every couple weeks making out of state deposits. <br /><br />Do you guys have any advise? Is there any special services i should be looking into, or do you think i have the right idea?

				Pretty much answered your question but if you have a friend that you can actually trust...rare these days just have the friend make the deposit for you. I do this all the time!

				It doesn&#039;t matter what bank branch you use as long as it&#039;s the same bank. A bank is a bank is a bank. So if you have several branches in your area you can rotate visits. Also rotate who makes the deposit.

				Note that some big US banks have policy that any cash transaction over $3000 USD will be reported or kept on file. fyi

				Buy a seller account, become a Bitcoin exchanger. This site full of people looking for cash in the mail, you have cash and need bitcoins, win/win. Or go on #bitcoin-otc and sell for cash in the mail. Build trust and can get all the coins you need, plus make money doing it<br /><br />Or buy online mail order gold/silver, sell it to people for coins on the usual sites. Buy a bunch of cellphones,&nbsp; ASICs and GPUs and other shit that sells for coins. Do research on bitcointalk what ppl want <br /><br />
