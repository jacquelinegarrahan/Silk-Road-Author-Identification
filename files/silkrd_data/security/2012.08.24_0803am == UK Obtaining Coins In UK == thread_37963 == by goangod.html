				what do you mean by &quot;intersango has gone belly up&quot;?<br />afaik only their UK bank accounts have problems, you can also use their Polish bank account for deposits,<br />I have never had any kind of problem with that one. (you will have to pay some fees for the GBP-&gt;EUR conversion,<br />but they are very low, 1-2 percent or so.
