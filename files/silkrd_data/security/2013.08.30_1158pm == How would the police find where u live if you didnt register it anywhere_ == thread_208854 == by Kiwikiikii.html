				So for instance i havent given the government, the banks, the insurance companies, my employer or my family my address, all my government/bank registration is at an old defunct address. The only person who knows where i live is my landlord, so he has that down in writing, but i dont think landlords register their tenants in any sort of central database, so if the cops were looking for me for whatever reason how would they go about finding me?

				Do you drive? All it takes is for a cop to see you talking on the phone, they pull you over, licence check... busted. <br /><br />Catch public transport without a ticket? Again, an easy way to get busted. <br /><br />Got a Facebook account which you use daily? Cops love following the trails on there.<br /><br />Go out late at night or to some dodgy areas frequented by cops? They can check your ID. <br /><br />Basically you need to lay real low for no one to notice you. <br /><br />As far as a landlord database goes, I dont think its reported to anyone. Might change very soon though, the more we embrace the IT world.

				Most of the time when you rent a house the power bill and other utilities will be in your name. There are easy ways around this... to live totally off the grid. Just be creative. People do it all the time.

				Lots of clearnet articles recently about how LE can use however many cameras they want to track you.&nbsp; Cop cars have cameras, lots of intersections have cameras, most stores have cameras, and they can all be checked and if you are seen on one or more of those cams LE can track your physical movement in vehicle or on foot or bike or rickshaw or whatever in the USA fully within the constitution according to supreme court.<br /><br />Cops can&#039;t put a GPS tracker on someone without getting a judge/grand jury/etc to sign off on it. But they can track people with the numerous security cameras that are in vehicles owned by govt, and lots of street intersections, commercial buildings, and other places with no warrant or anything required.&nbsp; So that&#039;s how I think they would find where you live if they cared.&nbsp; Or just follow you from somewhere they know you go, like that work place you talk about.

				If they are actually looking for you they&#039;d more than likely ask your bank for help. The bank may have your old address on file, but the cops can ask the bank to flag your debit/credit card, sooner or later you will use it with a cop around the corner close enough to get a hold of you. They got quite creative with that shit.<br /><br />If you use any sort of social media they can sift/analyze/correlate that shit too, quite efficiently so.<br /><br />There&#039;s a myriad of ways to track someone these days, and it&#039;s only getting worse. Plenty of European metropolitan cities are experimenting with facial recognition systems on their vast CCTV networks, heck one of them is even attempting to &quot;predict&quot; criminal behavior (I think it was London), so just loitering next to a pricey car might prompt a closer look by an officer. I think the next logical step in that department is to get live streams of the on-board security cams inside public transportation vehicles.<br /><br />All in all, times are getting rough for the wanted ones...
