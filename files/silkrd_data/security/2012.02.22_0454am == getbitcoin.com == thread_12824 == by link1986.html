				There is already a thread on get-bitcoin.com here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8370.msg115565<br /><br />I used them about a week ago (bank deposit method) and got the btc within 12 hours. I actually just used them again about 12 hours ago; still waiting for them to transfer the btc into my SR account.

				IMO the bank deposit isn&#039;t as anonymous as one would think... I know a lot of buyers are driving your cars there n shit instead of parking far away and walking and such...

				And not to mention that YOU are on camera too, facial recognition software...need I say more? Maybe that&#039;s being over paranoid, but I prefer to think it&#039;s just being extra careful. Use cash by mail with get-bitcoin.com sure it&#039;s going to take several days longer, but it&#039;s worth my peace of mind.

As someone else said, you might be waiting a while.

				Bitinstant.com works better. Turnaround time to get btc in sr account is 2 hrs max. I never like getbicoin because when you make deposit the account name you deposit to is getbitcoin,llc. Which pretty much the bank knows whats that all about and pretty sure they monitor activity on that account. When you use bitinstant.com. they use a third party bill pay service with no no mention of bitcoin. So when your going to the bank all they think is your going to pay a bill. Alot safer to me.

				Link1986:<br /><br />Be patient as this is your first time. You made an elementary mistake that I made as well my first time. They will email you in a period (probably 24 hours, maybe quicker) to inform you that they can&#039;t find bitcoins at that price, and would you subsequently like to by them at market price (roughly 4.35usd at time of post). Next time you use their service, put a 0 in the bitcoin price range and they will process your order at market price, ensuring in my opinion, transparency, and expedience. I have used them a number of times and they are expanding their staff as i understand. Hence the possibly abbreviated waiting time. Also, orders@get-bitcoin would be happy to answer a reasonably minded email I am sure...<br /><br />Stay Safe out there Kids<br />ggg

Which requires that you connect using your REAL IP address, they specifically indicate that they will require forms of further identification if you connect via the TOR network...thats one reason I&#039;ve always liked get-bitcoin.com is because its simple, cash by mail is secure, and they dont care if you use TOR.

				Yeah, there are ways around that. I won&#039;t specify exactly what I do. But, you can use a laptop goto public wifi. Best, a place no cameras. And so you do your transaction there. And yes, your right cash by mail is the most safest. But takes a little time and hope your mail doesn&#039;t get lost.
