				hi <br />i have a ukash voucher and i wanted to convert it into bitcoin by using a cashu account and then converting from their to bitcoin, via BCNordic<br />i set up the cashu account - and they asked for a phone number, which i made up <br />then when going to make the transaction of adding ukash to my cashu, further information was required an address (which i made up) and then a scanned image of an ID card (WTF!?) and a utility bill to prove the address (WTF!)<br />i stopped there and thought id check in with the good people of the Road<br /><br />anyone have any experience of adding ukash to a cashu account ? <br />thanks<br />

				I&#039;ve been looking into UKash &amp; CashU due to the recent closure of OTC funding of Mtgox in the UK. <br /><br />I saw it was possible to use Cashu or okpay to fund my mtgox account &amp; that I could use UKash to fund both of these. After putting some cash into UKash I went on MTgox to see how to fund via cashu. Turns out they only take Cashu in $ &amp; charge around 10% of the $ value. So that&#039;s exchange rate losses &amp; a 10% fee. I didn&#039;t go into the ucash verification stuff due to the high charges but I think a lot of these sites need some kind of verification due to money laundering &amp; tax laws. <br /><br />As the okpay fee on mtgox was only 1% I signed up on it and they&#039;ve got a 300Euro a month limit for &#039;unverified&#039; accounts, that&#039;s folk who&#039;ve not sent them a copy of ID, address &amp; phone call. I figured I&#039;d just setup 2 accounts if I needed to send more than 300Euros. <br /><br />Turns out though that despite their website saying they take UKash due to &#039;technical issues&#039; this is shut down, for at least a few weeks. Haven&#039;t found another solution using UKash - and I need one as I&#039;ve got Â£ tied up in there now.

				You may want to try mercabit.eu <br />Can&#039;t vouch for it but its discussed elsewhere on these fora. Bit pricey though: &quot;The fees I pay for providing<br />this service, to exchanges and 3rd party providers, are 11.5% over mtgoxEUR daily high<br />and get included in the final quote, along with my 0.12btc commission per transaction,<br />which is independent of the amount.&quot; <br />

I may be wrong though. And what&#039;s with the: &quot;I get charged 3% for redeeming other<br />currencies vouchers, so it will get included in your price quote, but you can convert to<br />EUR anytime with the ukash toolkit and avoid the extra fee on my part.&quot; What&#039;s that all about??<br /><br />All these threads really need to be merged into one big thread for discussing the pain us Britts are going through trying to get a good deal for bitcoins. It&#039;s just as big a headache searching through and cross posting!<br /><br />Come back Vlad, all is (almost) forgiven.
