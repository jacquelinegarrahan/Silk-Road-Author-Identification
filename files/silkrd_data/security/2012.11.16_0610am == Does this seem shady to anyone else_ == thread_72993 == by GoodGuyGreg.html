				Using a MP to BTC vendor. He asks for the MP code, amount, and Zip code where it was purchased. Okay that&#039;s fine. I send it encrypted with the PGP key from his page. Got a message from him asking to send it unencrypted because he cant decrypt on his iphone. Told him I don&#039;t feel comfortable doing that and will just wait till he is somewhere he can use PGP. He messaged me again asking me to encrypt it to a new key of his which he also put up on his profile page.<br /><br />I&#039;m a completely cautious and paranoid person, and from my perspective, this seems like it&#039;s LE on a repossessed account. <br /><br />Am I being nonsensically paranoid?

				A situation like that happened to me where someone had a new PGP.&nbsp; I was totally noided out and walked away.&nbsp; Fortunately the canceled.<br /><br />Not to put a downer on you, but I&#039;ve heard some negative hearsay on Moneypaks.&nbsp; Lots of scams and crap.&nbsp; I have no idea though.<br /><br />Ask them to recover their old PGP, but if this vendor&#039;s feedback or anything looks screwy, and takes too long to get back to you (if we are assuming this was a convert/mole and they didn&#039;t crack 100%, it should take some them time to get his info (don&#039;t quote me, but I believe it is inefficient to crack PGP), which will make the odds a big in our favor, otherwise, walk away.<br /><br />Some money is not worth your life.&nbsp; I&#039;d try to salvage what I could, but keep your liberty at a premium.<br /><br />Stay safe.

				I would be more worried about being scammed than leo as buying bit-coins raises suspicion but is not a crime.&nbsp; is there a reason you have not posted the vendor you might get more feedback that way. I have heard of a couple vendors mp-BTC but most I hear are &quot;poor me I just got scammed&quot;
