				Reading through the security forum, it seems like the proper processes for anonymity and security have been very well covered. However, it just dawned on me that LE is MUCH more likely to catch people through old-fashioned policework + perp&#039;s mistakes, not by hacking into your box and tracing your IPs from SR through multiple instawallets or whatever :)<br /><br />That said, anyone have advice on a couple top basic rules of thumb for conducting business either on the buying or selling end of SR? Probably good to include stuff that *should* be common sense since there&#039;s always a few who don&#039;t have it. (Apologies if this is already well covered elsewhere!)

				Your best bet is to find a vendor who uses photovoltaic cell triggered interception detection chips and have packages sent to private mail boxes registered with fake ID. Then you can remotely detect if a package has been intercepted on its journey from the vendor to you. However, nobody in the online drug scene is currently using this sort of technology, and as far as I know there is not much attempt being made at getting a design for these devices out. <br /><br />Vendors should make sure that they wear gloves of appropriate thickness the entire time they are coming into contact with packaging materials and drugs that can hold fingerprints on them (like sheets of LSD, hard tablet drugs, pretty much anything other than weed or power/tars). If they wear thin plastic type gloves then fingerprints can get out through them, because the thin plastic conforms to the contours of their fingerprints and turns the outside of the glove into a rubber stamp of sorts, which then presses debris/dust/etc into the shape of their fingerprints onto the packaging material. <br /><br />Vendors should ship from different locations and of course do so away from cameras. They should not carry a cellphone (or really any transmitting device) with them when they are shipping product. Also, they should seriously consider using public transportation or non-identifiable transportation. More and more cities have license plate scanners that keep record of the positioning of cars and if LE can identify enough areas shipped from they could carry out an intersection attack with the data from license plate scanners (or from cellphone geopositioning data as well).

				kmf do interception detection chips exist yet?<br />if so, where do we get them?<br />if so, how the fuck do we convince every single vendor to start using them?

No smart vendor would order a bunch of electronic components and start putting them in all of their outgoing packages. It needs to be a design and tutorial on how to construct the devices, maybe some open sourced software.

				Yes, they would have to be either made by the vendor or something so common that everyone IRL also used them. Their components would certainly have to be common and able to be purchased locally with cash.<br /><br />I would certainly make this a shipping option if such technology existed.
