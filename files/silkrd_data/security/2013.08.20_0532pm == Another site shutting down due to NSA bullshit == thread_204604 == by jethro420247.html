				No shield from forced exposure&#039;: Groklaw website shuts down over NSA spying<br />Published time: August 20, 2013 16:10<br />Edited time: August 20, 2013 17:09<br />Get short URL<br />AFP Photo / Mehdi Fedouach<br /><br />Tags<br />Information Technology, Intelligence, Internet, Law, SciTech, USA<br /><br />Groklaw, a legal news site that has won numerous awards for its courtroom coverage of tech issues during the last decade, is shutting down in the wake of revelations about the lack of online privacy.<br /><br />In a farewell post published on Groklaw.net early Tuesday, paralegal and founder Pamela Jones wrote that she will no longer update her site following the recent high-profile disclosures about digital surveillance programs operated by the United States government and other nations abroad.<br /><br />“[T]he conclusion I&#039;ve reached is that there is no way to continue doing Groklaw, not long term, which is incredibly sad. But it&#039;s good to be realistic,” she wrote.<br /><br />Jones said Tuesday that the recent shuttering of encrypted email provider Lavabit over surveillance woes put her over the edge with regards to whether or not she should continue publishing her site in the wake of leaked National Security Agency documents detailing vast-reaching spy programs that collect the emails entering and exiting the US.<br /><br />“The owner of Lavabit tells us that he&#039;s stopped using email and if we knew what he knew, we&#039;d stop too,” Jones wrote. “There is no way to do Groklaw without email. Therein lies the conundrum.”<br /><br />“And the simple truth is, no matter how good the motives might be for collecting and screening everything we say to one another, and no matter how ‘clean’ we all are ourselves from the standpoint of the screeners, I don&#039;t know how to function in such an atmosphere. I don&#039;t know how to do Groklaw like this,” she added.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Forced Exposure ~pj --- This is the last Groklaw article. Thank you for all you&#039;ve done. I will never forget you and our work together.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; — Groklaw (@Groklaw) August 20, 2013 <br /><br />&quot;There is now no shield from forced exposure,&quot; she wrote.<br /><br />Citing leaked NSA documents describing how any email intended or sent from a non-US person can be retained for years — as well as any correspondence encrypted for security — Jones wrote that she no longer feels comfortable running a site where she suspects her communications with an international audience can legally be intercepted by the US government.<br /><br />“I&#039;m just an ordinary person. But I really know, after all my research and some serious thinking things through, that I can&#039;t stay online personally without losing my humanness, now that I know that ensuring privacy online is impossible,” she said.<br /><br />“[F]or me, the Internet is over.”<br /><br />Jones’ decision comes less than two weeks after Lavabit owner Ladar Levison announced he’d be shutting down his email service after more than nine years. “I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit,” he wrote on his website. In an interview with RT, Levison made further comments suggesting that he was asked by investigators to provide the government with access to private emails or risk prosecution.<br /><br />“Our government can order us to do things that are morally and ethically wrong, order us to spy on other Americans and then order us — using the threat of imprisonment — to keep it all secret,” he told RT.<br /><br />Hours after Lavabit closed down abruptly, competitor Silent Circle said they’d be taking their secure email service offline as well after seeing “the writing on the wall.” Now only days down the road, another site has pulled the plug not over fears it will be asked to compromise the privacy of its customers, but because that sense of security is largely already absent.<br /><br />“Another site,” tweeted Cato Institute fellow Julian Sanchez, “decides it&#039;s not worth being online if there&#039;s no real privacy.”

				I feel like this is the beginning of a revolution of sorts. It might not be totalitarian in nature, but I have a feeling this is not the end of these types of stories. As more and more dominoes fall, the regular citizen has to recognize it, right?? Or is the &quot;it doesn&#039;t matter if I don&#039;t have anything to hide&quot; mindset too widespread these days? I even had a buddy of mine that I consider like-minded and very much a free thinker say to me that it didn&#039;t matter because he didn&#039;t have the energy to do anything about it. I about died...I told him it was our job to make sure our less than aware friends knew the bullshit that was happening. His response? &quot;Meh, like they care&quot;.

				This sort of apathy is what has been in the works for years. There are so many points to make it would take forever to explain how I truly feel about the evolution of oppression in America. Once the human populace feels powerless against oppression and humbly takes their whipping then the government has a much easier transition to totalitarianism. It&#039;s happened throughout history all across the globe. I say we look to the recent uprisings for inspiration when we begin to lose faith in our own personal freedom. Protest. March. Picket. If more people were actually involved and didn&#039;t back down then the government wouldn&#039;t feel it stood a chance against it&#039;s citizens. We are NOT the minority here and sadly peaceful protest will have to give way to more direct action.

				It makes me wonder how secure our programs really are.. I know we are not the ONLY ones that know about programs like tails, TBB, and other things... so why wouldn&#039;t they use something like that unless there was a flaw..However DPR is still out there doing his thing, so something must be working right on our end.. hmmm...... I wish I had the skills that some of you possess when it comes to computers and such.<br /><br />Ryno

				Great points guys. I think the problem is the daily struggle in this economy. Most of the people that have the time to protest/march/gather, rely on the government for their food, etc so it&#039;s like biting the hand that feeds them in their eyes. The other people that have time are generally financially independent and either don&#039;t care or are part of the driving force for the totalitarian movement for a global government.

				I&#039;d like to hear more evidence of a totalitarian movement to global government, Mucho. Maybe a corporate government state. But your point is well made. <br /><br />This is just so disappointing. And I talk to a lot of people who are more or less resigned, and don&#039;t even find it to be objectionable.

				I think the US did have a protest culture at one time. It would take something jarring—I don&#039;t know what—to wake Americans up again. Winston Churchill once said that you can always could on Americans to do the right thing—after they&#039;ve tried everything else. : )

He was detained at an airport I believe returning to meet up with Greenwald, I don&#039;t remember. The full story is at http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters but this section stood out<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That work is immensely complicated by the certainty that it would be highly unadvisable for Greenwald (or any other journalist) to regard any electronic means of communication as safe. The Guardian&#039;s work on the Snowden story has involved many individuals taking a huge number of flights in order to have face-to-face meetings. Not good for the environment, but increasingly the only way to operate. Soon we will be back to pen and paper.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />and this next one from steve gibson pretty much echos what people here have said:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Steve: There will be.

I think bitmessage is going to be a topic within the next few weeks.&nbsp; https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm has transcripts to all of them and low quality audio and then http://twit.tv/sn has audio and video links
