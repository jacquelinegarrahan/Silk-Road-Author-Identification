				I am currently looking into purchasing bitcoins and am slightly befuddled by all the conflicting/contradictory info here in the forums. Problem being that my funds are limited at the moment and I can&#039;t exactly afford to fuck up. <br /><br />I found a guy who sells bitcoins through Google Checkout, and was interested by the ease of it but somewhat sketched out by the idea of it being overseen by Google Checkout. On one hand, it means I&#039;m not going to get scammed. On the other hand... that doesn&#039;t sound very secure from LE taking a peek at it...<br /><br />For the curious, the address in question is here: http://www.1209k.com/bitcoin/<br /><br />My plan was to buy the bitcoins and transfer them to an instawallet. Then to another. Then to another. Before finally going to SR where they&#039;ll be tumbled. Am I missing any crucial steps here?<br /><br />Thoughts/suggestions?<br /><br />

				ExchB only works with certain banks, unless I&#039;m mistaken, which makes it fairly inconvenient for some of us who only have a few banks nearby. And unreliable modes of transportation. And a dislike of the sun.<br /><br />All this paranoia is starting to get to me... Any tips on cleaning/tumbling bitcoins?

				You can mail a money order to ExchB. Doesn&#039;t matter what bank is near you just buy a stamp. The cash deposit in the bank is faster perhaps but the mailing of a money order is just as safe. This method would be cheaper and safer than google checkout.<br /><br />PS - Fuck the sun I fucking hate it too!

				You can register at EXB and generate deposit slips for either BOA or Wells Fargo.&nbsp; You or your emissary can then make a cash deposit and within hours the funds should be available.<br /><br />There are also a couple of blokes here that do this for about 5% and within a couple of hours.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get ripped off.&nbsp; Know the market.
