				I hope you are able to sleep at night knowing that you put innocent people that never did or meant any harm upon others in dirty cages. I bet you are&nbsp; really proud of yourself every morning when you look in the mirror, proud of being a tool for a government that will never give a shit about you. You are so brainwashed you actually think you are doing something truly great when you bust a dealer. You hate drugs, you are disgusted by drug users and sellers, yet you drown your brain and destroy your liver by drinking alcohol to escape all the horrors of your job. <br />When you were young, you joined the academy thinking you can change the world, bring justice, serve the people. You loved this job. Is this the same feeling you have now? Do you like being a cop? When&#039;s the last time anyone thanked you for your service?<br />Everyone hates you, you are a disgusting filth. Even your kids and spouse hates you, they don&#039;t tell you that, but how do you think they felt when you weren&#039;t there for their birthday/anniversary? Ahh you were doing something more important like busting a fuckface for scoring smack on a back alley. Ahh you are such a hero! Congratulations!<br />You see the war on drugs has done nothing. With the war on drugs you lost whatever little respect people had for you. What do you think a mother thinks about you, when you send her 19 year old kid to the cage just because he had a flower called marijuana in his pocket? I bet she loves you, she will thank you for it every time she will see you. You have become the disgusting filth that you wanted to fight. Of course you hate your job, of course you can barely sleep at night, you know something&#039;s not right but the brainwashing and propaganda have taken over. Now you are a slave, a machine, a tool and nothing more. Do you think your master, the government will ever shed a tear if you die on duty? They won&#039;t give a fuck about you. Never!

				Sigh. I agree with all 3 of you. Nothing is so black and white though. The majority of my experiences with LE while obviously not pleasant, turned out ok simply because the officers themselves were respectable people. I could have had my 3 strikes by now if it weren&#039;t for nice cops. They absolutely do good things for us. At least in most the countries we are from, look how safe we are day to day... There are areas where this isn&#039;t quite so true, but really the levels of random violence are pretty low in most places. This is because of our strong governments. Just look at the countries where the government does not have control, and vigilantes and gangs rule. <br /><br />I also agree they are brainwashed about drugs, they see the worst of the worst day to day. Many more legal things ruin just as many peoples lives except those things aren&#039;t illegal. I think all governments will always be scared of drugs unfortunately. I do every god damn thing possible to avoid contact with LE because there is a small but substantial percentage of them that are not good people. These assholes are the ones ruining lives. I&#039;ve seen my share of police brutality, and blatant lies on police reports and all that. I now realize that you NEED to have cameras. Hidden cameras in your home and vehicle. Then show up to court and flip them the bird as they toss the case out. But seriously, Fuck LE.

				Although this is kinda off topic.. but back in college once I was at a buddies place and we were all drinking. Now his older brother (few years older then us) was a cop. A rookie/newbie cop, but he was always chill and had gone to highschool with us. So we were all getting shitfaced, and there was some blow going out discreetly. To my surprise, the friends brother (reminder: was absolutely a cop) actually took a bump infront of me. He was fucking drunk as shit and just did it. I&#039;m not sure if it was a lapse in judgement or if he routinely partied like that, but I thought that was cool. Odd, but cool. Dunno if he stayed a cop or what.. but I had always thought that even though cops will sometimes take peoples drugs and resell to friends/family, I had never heard of a cop casually USING. Especially coke.<br />I always thought they get piss tested all the time and even 1 strike they&#039;re fucked.

				It&#039;s not LE I hate... they&#039;re just a bunch of tools who hate people and now need to beat them up for a living.&nbsp; They really have no fucking idea what they&#039;re doing and they don&#039;t think enough to realize that a lot of what they do is bullshit.&nbsp; They just like to exercise their power, the same way we like to exercise our power to order and use whatever drugs we like.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s the politicians I hate.&nbsp; They created this &quot;war on drugs,&quot; have completely backwards ideas on how to solve social problems, and keep pouring money into drug convictions and programs.

				redfunguy, go buy yourself a history book.&nbsp; The Mongol Conquests (which later established the Silk Road) left 60 million people dead.&nbsp; The Holocaust left millions dead.&nbsp; And genocide in Rwanda has left hundreds of thousands dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;Or just look around at the present day, take Mexico for example, where the police are para-military in cahoots with narcos.&nbsp; 120,000 dead in six years.<br /><br />Cops have a place in society.&nbsp; Perhaps you disagree with some of the laws they enforce, but I believe they do more good than harm.<br /><br />lelmeriodic

Someone has to be in power, that&#039;s just how it is. Thieves and murderers are just a fact of life. They have always been around and most likely always will be. So that gives the police a job. Yeah you&#039;re right that they are just the ruling class&#039;s gang, doing their fucked up bidding, but we have it pretty good right now. If we didn&#039;t have this government then the next most powerful person with the biggest gang would take over immediately. Not ALL LE are pieces of shit, many of them really went into the field to try and help people. Most didn&#039;t stay that way though. I guess my point is some of them that spend their days dealing with real crime which is what they enjoy, will still have to bust some drug users regardless of whether they want to or not. Now the LE that are reading this, that is an entirely different matter, what OP said.

				The federal bureaucratic rules against drugs are the real problem. Still, individual cops piss me off too because they are indeed worthless tools enforcing unjust laws. It falls to the individual because there&#039;s plenty of cops who don&#039;t care about petty bullshit, and there&#039;s cops who love to power-trip and get a boner from fucking over some kid with weed.

Thing is, we all are all responsible for are own lives. Is shit fucked up? yeah. That&#039;s how it&#039;s going to be. Like I said, I have first hand experience with police brutality, with absolutely no recourse available, because a pigs word is basically law. Most of us need to work in life to have what most of us call acceptable living conditions. This isn&#039;t hard to achieve. We are at a point in history where we are extremely productive, lots of people only work 8 hour days 5 days a week and live very comfortably. Humans historically worked much longer days just to survive. Survival isn&#039;t even on most of our minds day to day. We have much more trivial things to worry about as in how to improve our quality of life. Without the strong government this is not possible. I very recently had a government agency come in and help out me and others very professionally. In that instance I was pretty proud of them for how well they handled it. Happiness is all on you. People tend to enslave themselves, rack up bills for things they don&#039;t need and get stuck at a job they hate. People are inherently afraid of change and like to feel safe and comfortable. Fuck that, you aren&#039;t happy? Go do something else. Fuck LE though I agree.

				Yeah I missed the first half of your post, and I completely agree with you. We are very close to powerless and yes the government does absolutely steal peoples lives without any kind of just reasoning. I have no loyalty to them whatsoever, I have a healthy fear of them, that I am able to keep under control to do what little I can to fight back in my own way. As we all know, just have to do your thing and prepare for the day they try to fuck you. It won&#039;t surprise me one bit if I find myself in a fucking cell, and I absolutely no not commit any crimes that hurt others. I just have to everything in my power to try to avoid this when the shit hits the fan. Until then, I go about my day freely and live a good life.

				Can&#039;t agree more about the mother having a child incarcerated over herb.&nbsp; This is why non smokers are voting to legalize it.&nbsp; Non smokers are seeing family and friends who are knowingly good people being dismissed and labeled by the government and enforcement as high level criminals.&nbsp; Protect and serve is part of the job for police but I am willing to bet that at least half of their day consist of writing tickets and penalizing civilians that could have fed their families for a month with that money over some stupid citation.&nbsp; Or better yet, arresting a parent and making another welfare child.&nbsp; Good work officer.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see LE as an enemy or anything.&nbsp; I do know several of them see us as the enemy though.

We must be willing to sacrifice these things if any sort of change is to happen.<br /><br />I think the fact that Governments will throw you in prison for not letting them steal (tax) your hard-earned cash sums them up perfectly. Greedy, power hungry scum.<br /><br />More on tax - If governments taxed the super-rich half of what they earn yearly, it would be ten times the amount of tax they are currently stealing off the poor. And those same super-rich people would still be super-rich.

So really I think you just gave some good examples that show &quot;just doing a job&quot; is not a fucking excuse for the behavior of the police, or are you a Nazi apologist ?

				Okay, without cops, society would fall apart.&nbsp; This was proven during the police strike in Toronto in the 1980&#039;s and no one can question the social check that LEOs have on the general public.<br /><br />Having said that, the profession tends to attract far too many type-A, quarterback personalities who think they&#039;re god&#039;s gift to the badge.&nbsp; When I first started in LE, I thought it was just me being new, but no - a lot of cops are genuinely dicks.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; See above.&nbsp; They have unmet personality needs, unmet ambition, unmet needs to please superiors, to get promoted, to get better cars, to get a look for the narc division, or the detective division, or the K-9 div, or whatever it is that they currently are not.&nbsp; They tend to be cliquish, and most don&#039;t give a damn (if they&#039;ve been there awhile) about conviction rates.&nbsp; Then, there&#039;s the one or two who love the little notes that go in your box telling you your guy was convicted.&nbsp; But, most cops feel they&#039;ve done their job if a traffic stop culminates in an arrest, without incident.&nbsp; Another notch in the belt.&nbsp; Another blue form with your name on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a different experience, which I would love to tell you about, but which might expose me.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that, while so many times you&#039;re stuck picking up the mess that other people made (murders, serious injuries), my position&nbsp; in the department made it possible for me to actually help victims of violence, and connect them with resources that could continue to help them long after I had gone.&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; said too much already.<br /><br />Generally speaking, cops are dicks, cogs in the wheel of government machinery designed to inhibit personal freedom and enforce the maximum level of control.&nbsp; They are the foot soldiers in the war on drugs.&nbsp; They have us outgunned, and so our only defense is the law.&nbsp; Because they don&#039;t know the law as well as they think they do, and run roughshod over it all the time.&nbsp; The 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th amendments are your friends.&nbsp; Get to know them very well.

				Cops.... oh how we love to hate them!<br /><br />I have a little story I want to tell. This is a true story. Information has been changed enough so that it no longer puts anyone in danger.<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was a pothead. A harmless fellow, grew his own pot in his basement, did not other drugs, owned no weapons of any sort, very peace loving hippy sort of fella. Kept to himself, had never been in trouble with the law. One day, Mr. Hippy was smoking a joint, watching TV when suddenly there came a rapping, rapping at his chamber door. Actually more of a WHAM WHAM WHAM followed by &quot;Open up this is the police we have a warrant&quot;. Mr. Hippy was stunned but ran over to the door and unlocked it right as the cops hit it for the first time with the battering ram. The door flew open, barely missing Mr. Hippy and slamming against the wall while 5 guns were stuck in Mr. Hippy&#039;s face. Mr. Hippy was put on the floor, handcuffed and led away. The execution of the search warrant preceded and Mr. Hippy&#039;s house was cleaned out of much paraphernalia, a little bit of herb, and 5 decent sized plants ready to harvest. Mr. Hippy did not resist. Did not struggle. Did not even say anything harsh (too stunned by events) and simply respectfully asked for a lawyer. At one point, he even spoke with the cops. At the end, one of the police officers actually apologized for everything that was going on, but that they were only doing their job. The police then provided Mr. Hippy (now in jail) with a receipt for the seizure totally much paraphernalia, growing shit, and 10 decent sized marijuana plants.<br /><br />Mr. Hippy&#039;s memory of the events were incredibly odd, thinking he had been busted by the nicest bunch of cops on earth, and wasn&#039;t really sure what to think about it. 3 weeks later he was released from jail because the DA had chosen not to pursue the indictment. Reason? Because this peaceful hippy that was polite, didn&#039;t resist, and had nothing but pot and pot growing stuff for what was obviously a personal stash, had actually had FIVE plants and not TEN plants. The receipt said 10, and when push came to shove, only 5 were in evidence. This broke the whole chain of evidence and made the entire search inadmissible. So... could the cops really not count? were they really so bad at their job that they grossly miscounted plants when leaving a receipt, one of the most important parts of executing a search warrant? Or did they intentionally miscount once they realized this old hippy was harmless and actually a pretty decent guy?<br /><br />No way to know. The fact is that police are in a position of authority, so when one of them is dirty or abusive or corrupt, it is plastered EVERYWHERE. When they are good, considerate, decent people, nothing is heard. <br /><br />My guess is that there are lots of decent people who become police. I&#039;d further gamble most of them remain decent people throughout their careers. Unfortunately there are also those piece of shit, arrogant, pig fucking ass wipes that think they are better than the common man, and insist on lording their power over those that have none. Sadly there is no way to differentiate.<br /><br />Follow the ACLU&#039;s advice when dealing with ALL cops and you&#039;ll get the best deal possible.<br />Remain respectful<br />keep your mouth shut. <br /><br />damn I&#039;m high<br />Thanks SR! ;)<br /><br /><br />***this story, while true, has had many elements changed to protect the TRUE story if you know what i mean!<br />

I think to a good proportion it&#039;s also the fault of the general population and even drug users. If everyone would sell and usedrugs openly, LE wouldn&#039;t be able to do shit. Imagine if 1000 people would gather in a square and light up a joint. What would the cops do? Arrest everyone? Pepper spray them all, use water cannons on them. They would most likely try to intimidate and threat everyone, but what if they would not let themselves be intimidated then what? Drug use had to be demonized and the dealers and users dehumanized for this to work. Most drug users never openly admit to using drugs for fear of being stigmatized. People stereotype and stigmatize drug users because of plain ignorance and propaganda.

				Politicians are scum but they are also tools. <br />We must reform campaign financing. Corporations are not bloody people (pun). They do not starve.<br />e.g Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas, house judiciary committee, for years he refuses to discuss why marijuana is a schedule 1 narcotic.<br />Why? because his campaign is financed, among others, by the beer, wine and liquor industry, his 3rd largest contributor. The largest? The content industry, a dear friend to a lot of us here.<br />If we can&#039;t change campaign financing, well... we all know that JFK quote about revolutions<br /><br />P.S the alcohol lobby gave him roughly $60000 in the last few years, not a fortune and not directly to his pocket. It is sad to think how many innocent civilians&#039; freedoms were &quot;bought&quot; by those $60k

				Sure police have downsides and upsides. On the upside they will allegedly help you if you are burglarized, raped, robbed, etc. They hunt down murderers and child molesters and all kinds of fine shit that is overall quite good for society. On the other hand, they ruin peoples lives over drug crimes, they enforce censorship laws ruining peoples lives over information, they protect the interests of a corrupt power elite that is only concerned with itself and not with what is best for everybody and morally acceptable, they do all kinds of nasty shit. The thing is that these behaviors can be separated! If Bob the plumber fixes my broken toilet then he did a good thing , and since I am not a plumber maybe he even does something that society requires to function at its current state of efficiency. On the other hand, if Bob the plumber fixes my toilet and then ass rapes me , I am not going to defend Bob the plumber on the grounds that he does something good for society as well. Rather, I am going to strongly suggest that we fucking kill Bob the plumber, and replace him with Joe the plumber who does not ass rape his customers. Law enforcement as a theoretical construct is fine and dandy, perhaps even indispensable for a good section of society. The law enforcement that we have in practice, in every single country in the world, is like Bob the rapist plumber. They do not need to be apologized for on the grounds that they offer services that society can not do with out, because these services could just as well be offered by people who are not vicious fucking slave traders. Nobody is really saying fuck law enforcement in general, we are saying fuck these plumbers who ass rape us after fixing our toilets, let&#039;s kill them all and replace them with some new plumbers who don&#039;t ass rape us after fixing our toilets.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the end of the day we are far too passive. We are far morally superior to our enemies, they attack us mercilessly and unprovoked, and most of us are too afraid to even say that they are evil in doing so. Rather, many of us try to apologize for them, we make excuses for what they do, it is like saying Bob the plumber is a damn fine plumber so who cares if he rapes his customers? It is like saying Bob the plumber is just doing his job, who cares that in the process of doing his job he rapes his customers. I think the issue is that psychedelic users in particular tend to be pacified by the drugs they consume, it gives some people a more childlike mentality of naivety and always trying to see the good in things. Don&#039;t let that personality profile turn you into a fucking Nazi apologist.
