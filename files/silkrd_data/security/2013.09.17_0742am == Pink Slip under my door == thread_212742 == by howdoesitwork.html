				So today my roommate gave me a pink slip I got in the mail today. It just says they missed me and that they&#039;ll be back to try again tomorrow. I ordered a gram of dabs on the 27th of august and they never came, does this time frame match most CD&#039;s? What the hell should I do tomorrow? Why the fuck would they do a CD for a grab of dabs anyways????

				Never mind having to look up what the hell &quot;dabs&quot; was...&nbsp; it depends on when it was shipped and where it&#039;s coming from etc.<br /><br />Was it shipped a week later?&nbsp; Was it shipped from EU to the US?... then a month wouldn&#039;t be out of question.&nbsp; Even things form Canada can take a couple weeks.&nbsp; Did the vendor reship to you?... this time requiring a sig since you didn&#039;t get the last one?<br /><br />Anyhow, I highly doubt you&#039;d get a cd for gram of BHO.&nbsp; I personally would just sign for it... hell, there are people around signing for Kg&#039;s of shit.&nbsp; And I personally think court wise, them leaving a &quot;missed you&quot; notice works against the prosecution... since now you have a reason to expect a package, you got a notice.

				I&#039;d rather just lose $100 then risk a CD. If something never came on time for me I would just refuse delivery saying I don&#039;t recognize sender nor expecting anything. Then I&#039;d get in my car and drive away not even giving a shit if I was driving past a stakeout because there wouldn&#039;t be a damn thing they could do at that point..... I can&#039;t imagine all this for a gram though unless it&#039;s heroin and you live in Kansas.

				It might be someone sending you papers trying to sue you. Or that your great Aunt Birgit died and left you a fortune in her will.<br /><br />-Just a thought not all signature deliveries are drugs.

				I think its highly unlikely they&#039;ll CD you for a gram. But at the same time, its important to consider where you live. Do you live in a large metropolitan area? Or do you live in the middle of nowhere, where the cops have nothing to do and are just dying to make a bust to keep themselves from going crazy with boredom? If you live in a city, the chances of a CD for a gram are slim to none. In some small community with no crime ever, possibly...

				You can imagine the O,P when he&#039;s out and about driving along, he see&#039;s cops in his rear view mirror. From that exact moment all his movements are exaggerated&nbsp; he is trying his best to act calm, but his fervent movements are drawing more attention. It&#039;s only a matter of time before the cop lights him up. On his way to county he wished he could of acted&nbsp; normal.

				If I was you I&#039;d just kill the postman. Then you don&#039;t have to sign plus no witnesses to your drug activity. Congratulations on winning the drug game.

However a &quot;sorry we missed you&quot; slip, really just means that it would not fit in your mailbox/slot and the postal carrier did not feel &quot;comfortable&quot; or &quot;safe&quot; leaving it at your door.<br /><br />Read the small print carefully, you can actually sign the back and check a box or two and they will leave it for you. This is all totally normal PO stuff.<br /><br />Sign the slip now and hang it outside the door.....<br /><br />USUALLY...<br /><br />the Postal Carrier will collect the slip the next time they swing by..and THEN drop the package off the FOLLOWING DAY.<br /><br />Keep perspective on all this OP - no one is trying to bust you for 1g of BHO<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Hope you do not lose sleep tonight

Im just one of those paranoid people who would rather dump the drugs than try to get it back. I have very bad experience with cops in germany. I got caught with a couple of grams of weed and had to take drug tests for a year and almost lost my drivers license even though I was on foot. So i am extremely distrustful of the system.
