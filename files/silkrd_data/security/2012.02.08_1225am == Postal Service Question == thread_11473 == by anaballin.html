				Any buyers deal with signing for packages?<br /><br />I buy from a certain vendor and am required to sign for the package. All i do is sign a card and he gives me the pakage and I&#039;m on my merry way.<br /><br />This time though... he had me sign the card as usual.. but then he had me sign the package.. and THEN he proceeded to take my package and put it on<br />a photocopy machine and scanned an image of the package with my address, signature, return address, etc on it.<br /><br />Idk, but that was real sketchy to me.

				Wait, wat?<br /><br />Why are you signing for packages at all? Discuss this with your vendor or change them. You can get fast delivery in most countries without having a signature required. Usually the sig costs more in fact.

I am afraid that I might have to start searching for a new vendor despite his great product and prices.<br /><br />The signing is just stressing me out way too much.. I&#039;m just concerned right now though if I should even go to the post office tomorrow for my next package arriving? It&#039;s fucked up too because I&#039;m getting a QP and my state law says that anything over a QP is a felony.. and my vendor always packs overweight lol

				Doesn&#039;t seem like a square deal to me. If I were vending I wouldn&#039;t be doing that to my customers because it would be fucking stupid.<br /><br />Avoid. It&#039;s a dead loss, take it or take the risk of getting a couple of months in the clink. Quantities shipped should be nowhere near a felony amount. That amount changes depending on location, but my position is that anything over 10 grams is not a hot idea. Start over again to a new address.

I am going to have to confront the vendor about this issue because this can&#039;t go on much longer.. I think i may just go to another vendor and spend the extra $200 for my peace of mind.
