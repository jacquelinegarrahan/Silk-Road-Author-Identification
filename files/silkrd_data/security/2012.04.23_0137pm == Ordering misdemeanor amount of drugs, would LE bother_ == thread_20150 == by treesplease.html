				technically it&#039;s smuggling/importing a controlled substance. but normally little amounts of anything get confiscated and you get a love letter from customs telling you to stop being naughty

You won&#039;t get busted for weed (unless they think you&#039;re dealing) - but you might get busted for personal amounts of coke/h. It&#039;s still very unlikely but you do hear about it from time to time. Usually though in those cases the person IS a dealer and they probably already have surveillance/evidence on them, and the stuff found in the post is just a nail in the coffin.<br /><br />99% chance if it does get found you&#039;ll either hear nothing about it, or get a letter.<br /><br />

				From personal experience, nothing, absolutely nothing happened when I got a domestic order confiscated. They didn&#039;t send me a letter or knocked on my door, but obviously they flagged my address so I never sent packages to that address again. I am constantly getting packages from ebay/amazon so they probably just figured it was a mistake or something. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also had 5g of MDMA confiscated from the NL and even then they didn&#039;t do anything, two guys came looking for my fake alias at the address I listed but luckily a friend of mine was working the front desk and told them that the person didn&#039;t work there anymore so they just left. As long as you&#039;re not ordering large amounts they won&#039;t care about you, but if you do get an order confiscated you better not send another one to the same address.&nbsp;
