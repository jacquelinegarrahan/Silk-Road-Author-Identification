				I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but does anyone buy bitcoins using something like a prepaid visa from walmart or know if its possible? <br /><br />If so, could someone point me in the direction of a reliable website?&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;m not a minor, I just haven&#039;t had a steady job so I just started actually purchasing from the site. I&#039;ve just been using cash deposits in small amounts from walmart.and I wanted to start using a card because they always act really suspicious when I go there and do it in person.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member of this site for over a year, I just haven&#039;t started buying anything untill about 6 months ago, and I started using the forums only a couple months ago. <br /><br />

				A lot of people are in the same boat. Weather it be because of the economy. How far/deep they are in their drug addiction or mental health. These are reasons why someone in their 20s might not have a job now. I don&#039;t know what his reasons are, but i&#039;m in the same boat. I have a little bit of extra cash to spend every month, so i decide to come to SR for better/cleaner and also more varied products then what i&#039;d find on the street.<br /><br />P.S. What&#039;s up with these icons? What happened to the forums? I&#039;ve been away for a few days.

				Rather than bashing you for a simple question, i&#039;ll go ahead and share what i know. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119942.msg814050#msg814050">Quote from: asbdaff on February 11, 2013, 05:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but does anyone buy bitcoins using something like a prepaid visa from walmart or know if its possible? <br /><br />If so, could someone point me in the direction of a reliable website?&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For the past 20 or so deposits I&#039;ve simply went to any retail store selling Green Dot MoneyPak&#039;s (google it to see a picture before heading off to the store if you prefer) and loaded whatever amount onto the card along with the $5 fee.&nbsp; You then scratch off the code on the back and it works as a giftcard from this point on. There are many vendors on SR itself that offer a transfer service between MoneyPak and BTC however the rates and wait times vary immensely. I always have and always will use the vendor BitcoinDeal. I can vouch for them 200% and if you want a sure fire way to get your coins, they&#039;re who to go with. Another vendor I see a lot of is Sugar Mama though I can&#039;t personally give any experience with her. DO NOT GIVE YOUR CODE TO ANY VENDOR WHO YOU DO NOT HAVE COMPLETE FAITH IN AND HAVE RESEARCHED! This will lead to nothing but you being scammed and losing your money. Hope this helps you out :)

Listen if your American use www.bitinstant.com&nbsp; put your SR address in it,and choose the send to address option..<br />Go to Wal-mart or somewhere like that, who cares if they&nbsp; look at u eweird or whatever, ITS LEGAL!!! TO BUY COINS! U R DOING NOTHING WRONG! they can think all they want but until its illegal FUCK IT BRO.... Beside using a credit card leaves a paper trail,COLD CASHDOES NOT..<br /><br />But To the subject of not working an being between Jobs i know what ya mean, Luckily when my Grandma passed away i was left a nice sum of money but thing is she knew i was bad off,i spent 20 k out of one of her accounts on year, so i cant fully get the money she left me until im 30, But i was lucky enough to get a beautiful house with 10 acees wich my dad got 10 and i just wanted the house and the small 3 acres on it..Fuck having to keep up 10 acres of land.... But im still right now far from rich, good thing i go to college and i get Money back from left over student Loan money, I make sure i request to MAX OUT my loans every term so i will have anywhere from 900 to 2grand left over and i get a check sent back every 15 weeks...<br /><br />U should look into going back to college bro! Apply for student loans and gants..Its easy.. Im in computer science and about done, when im done im going back for Business.. So im getting a great education that boosts my getting a Esy good job, and the perks is I get Cash sent to me every term, my terms are 12 weeks.. Im waiting for my left over money now, when i get it<br /><br />300 to 400 right to SR!!! LOL , The place i cash my check they have mony gram so i always cash it, then take my zipzap paper and add coins while im there.. Only one time did the lady which iv come to know very well, i had to gic their computer one time, asked me what is zipzap? I just said its a investment that not many people know about but its rising, i told her remember the first time i did this? coins were around 6 bucks or something, now there 13..This was&nbsp; while ago,she then tells me she wans to get in and maybe invest,,LMAO!!<br /><br />WHICH MAN IF I HAD PUT 200 IN A WALLET WHEN THEY WERE SINGLE OR AT LEAST 12 AND CHANGE ID HAVE A NICE CHUNK NOW..sorry for getting off sibject....<br /><br />but OP TRY NOT TO GO INTO THE SAME PLACE OVER AND OVER, BUT IF U DO THEY CANT DO NOTHING, UR MAKING A INVESTMENT,
