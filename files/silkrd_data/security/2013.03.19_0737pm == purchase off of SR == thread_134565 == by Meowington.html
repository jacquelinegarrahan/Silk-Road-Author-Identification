				recently I received a message here on the forums from somebody named ezecocaina... He is attempting to sell me cocaine so he can purchase a vendor status on the actual SR for his product. He has also offered me a free sample if I wished to do so, I but he also asked to pay for the shipping of it (supposedly from Peru), but would be alright if I didn&#039;t.. I would really love to try this guy&#039;s product(If he is actually legit and not LE) just because I am curious to see some better Cocaine vendors on the road... he has also agreed to use privnote (after I contacted through tormail) I just need some advice in what you all belive I should do. Either receive the free sample of his product(supplying my name and address) and help him out... or skip out on the whole event and save myself from the paranoia.. Also if anybody has heard from this guy or even received anything from him.. any info would be apprrciated.. thanks:) <br /><br />-Meowington

				I would consider 100% of any pm&#039;s you get like that on the forum are scams second only to the great BTC for moneypak deals.

				please don&#039;t ever be so naive. I know you&#039;re probably being optimistic and the prospect of a good deal + creating a business bond with a good vendor is awfully appealing, buut it&#039;s simply not worth it. If you have done your research on SR (as you should have thorougly) you would not be oblivious to the fact that the escrow system is what protects the buyer and promotes a safe, reliable exchange. <br /><br />Is there a chance this guy or others will come through? Most definintely. However, the downside is simply much more likely. You are better served saving your money and paying the going rate for an established, trusted vendor. Think about this and do more research.
