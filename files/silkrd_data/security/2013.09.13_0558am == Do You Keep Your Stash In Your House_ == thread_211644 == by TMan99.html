				Do you guys keep your personal stash in your house? Keeping it in the house, while you have a package coming with your name on it seems risky. If they execute a CD it would be over just like that. <br /><br />I would love to know how I can get rid of my stash while I have some stuff coming in the mail so I can just deny if I run into problems.

				Notorious B.I.G. - The Ten Crack Commandments.<br /><br />Don&#039;t deal from your place, and don&#039;t keep any on you.<br /><br />And agreed, get a drop that&#039;s not connected to you. Bury your stuff in a mason jar somewhere that won&#039;t get found, and don&#039;t forget that it&#039;s there.

				when ever i make an order i take everything illegal out of my house and put it in a buried chest in the back yard. <br />a couple days after its all clear, it comes back in the house<br /><br />of course this is because i dont deal, and inside the house has a million times the legal protections <br />

				Fair enough, that would put me at ease somewhat. <br /><br />Are there any mason jars that keep the products fresh even while being underground? Where could I get them?

				Depends on the order quantity, chances are for a half ounce of weed they&#039;re probably not going to bring in the troops, wheras for 500g of MDMA, itd be much much wiser to take every precaution possible<br /><br />Also depends on vendor packaging techniques, if the addy is flagged/you&#039;ve had lvoe letters from customs before etc.<br /><br />Generally my stash consists of a load of benzos, opiates and maybe some speed, and a load of pharms, enough to keep me happy for the forseeable future but not enough to do time :), i&#039;m happy to take the risk
