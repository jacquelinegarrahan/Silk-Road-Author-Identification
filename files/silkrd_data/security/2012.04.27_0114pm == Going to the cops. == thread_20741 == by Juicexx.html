				Just my opinion.&nbsp; Don&#039;t say that.&nbsp; That sounds like your trying to cover something up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Say you didn&#039;t order a package, you don&#039;t know what&#039;s in it. Deny everything and say you had no knowledge of these events.

				So if one finds themself in OP&#039;s situation, do you guys think it would be best to go in and deny everything, or simply not show and demand a lawyer if they come knocking again? Don&#039;t talk to the police sounds like the best advice to me no?

				guilt or innocence is never determined by what is NOT said... only what IS said...&nbsp; (and the evidence but since your NOT under arrest then that says it all)<br /><br />you are NOT obligated to speak to anyone in Law Enforcement EVEN if you are under arrest... so why would you do it &#039;on the house&#039;?<br /><br />Look you know yourself better than anyone else... are you the kind of guy who can&#039;t handle pressure? does speaking to an authority figure make you want to unburden yourself of all your wrong doings? can you look a cop in the eye and tell him to go fuck himself? (not advised)&nbsp; <br /><br />if your worried get an attorney and let him represent you... I would not recommend playing cat and mouse with them... they do it for a living... let the constitution work for you.. it is your ONLY friend in this situation.<br /><br />good luck!<br />TJ

				I&#039;d just say something like, &quot;I&#039;m not comfortable talking to you about this without a lawyer&quot;. In the mean time, I&#039;d remove any and all evidence from your computer that&#039;s associated with SR in any way, and remove any drugs and/or paraphernalia from your house.

				The don&#039;t want you in for negotiation, it&#039;s called interrogation!<br /><br />This is what would happen, you go in, they act all nice, although very serious... and start asking you questions. <br /><br />OR they start telling you they KNOW YOU DID SOMETHING. They have witnesses, video, audio ANYTHING. They will say anything and use any tactic to get you to talk. They&#039;ll get quiet and say they&#039;re just trying to help you get this put behind you. They&#039;ll let you sweat it out in a locked room for hours until you crack.<br /><br />Can you say NO, No, no, no no no no no for hours on end like a broken record regardless of what threats and evidence they school you with? DO YOU EVEN WANT TO?<br /><br /><br />Follow the advice here. Call them back (OR DON&#039;T EVEN!!!), and tell them you&#039;ve done NOTHING wrong, know NOTHING, and you&#039;re NOT going to talk to THEM. For ANY REASON. If you have anyone who&#039;s a lawyer, or anyone knowledgeable enough to pose as your lawyer, tell them they can call them. They probably won&#039;t because it will have zero results! <br /><br />Good luck!

				It&#039;s as simple as this:<br /><br />Law enforcement doesn&#039;t have anything on you. They are asking you to come and talk to them so you can incriminate yourself. Remember, police are legally able to lie to you. If they had anything on you, you wouldn&#039;t be asked to come and talk to them. Instead, your door would just be getting kicked in. Just don&#039;t show and don&#039;t answer your door if detectives or police know. They would just kick it in if they had a warrant. You are safe as long as you NEVER SAY A FUCKING WORD to the police. ALWAYS consult a lawyer BEFORE saying anything to law enforcement.

				&gt; So the cops discovered an order. They want me in for negotiation.<br /><br />Just say No Kids.<br /><br />Police don&#039;t request a meeting if they have evidence you&#039;ve committed a crime. They arrest you instead.<br /><br />If you do walk into a police station, then watch the &#039;don&#039;t talk to the police&#039; youtube video first. <br /><br />If you *are* arrested, then lawyer up and STFU. More people would be walking the streets if they took that simple advice.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t arrested, then you&#039;re under no obligation to &#039;help the police with their inquiries&#039;. You are a far too busy mammal. You still have yet to watch all seasons of I Love Lucy for example.<br /><br />btw: Some people don&#039;t seem to fully understand this. I did not say: &#039;Deny Deny Deny&#039;. I said don&#039;t talk. If you&#039;re arrested you don&#039;t claim you are innocent of a crime, any sooner than you would confess to one. Just don&#039;t talk full stop apart from giving mandatory details like your place of residence and your name etc, which is usually legally required in your state whether or not you talk to the police.

				Have any of you watched 48 hours on A&amp;E on a regular basis? It&#039;s amazing how many people fess up or try to argue their way out of it, all they did was make the case stronger or wrap it up for them.. I would say 95 percent or higher admit it or say something to mess them up..<br /><br />The few guys that never said a word, i would say at least half of them couldnt be charged with anything, because of the evidence. the others that were convicted, were convicted of a lesser charge, like manslaughter or something..<br /><br />If that show doesn&#039;t prove that you shouldn&#039;t say one word to the police i dont know what will. Like a previous poster said, dont deny or admit, just tell them you have no idea what they are talking about and lawyer up. <br /><br />Also, those homicide detectives lie like crazy, telling suspects that another suspect snitched when they really didnt or tell them that they have dna that will link them.. If they have dna, why tell the suspect.. the cops will act that you are doing yourself a favor by telling them what they want to hear.. It makes me sick when I hear them tell a suspect &quot;If you tell us know, it will make it better on you in the long run&#039; and when they leave the room they high five each other and charge their suspects with first degree murder, so how did admitting anything help?<br /><br />Im sure thats what they do in every departments investigations..<br /><br />I would fork out a few hundred bucks to get a lawyer retained and just refer any questions to him/her as you have done nothing wrong...

				the ONLY words you should EVER EVER say to a cop are:<br /><br />&quot;I CHOSE TO REMAIN SILENT&quot;<br /><br />that&#039;s it!&nbsp; nothing before, nothing after!&nbsp; if they are in your presence and ask for ID, you must show them ID.&nbsp; other than that, the above 5 words are the only words you should ever say.<br /><br />remember it is your RIGHT to remain silent, but once you open your mouth and LIE.. that&#039;s when a crime happens.

				Bump to what ChronicPain wrote: the people who are arrested are ones that talk. You&#039;ll notice on the cases where the interrogated never say a word, they usually walk out, and the case goes &#039;unresolved&#039;. <br /><br />I won&#039;t reiterate what everyone has been suggesting, except that in addition to what everyone else has said, you need to delete this post/thread as well as your community member profile, considering you named what order it was they&#039;re questioning you about. It&#039;s amazing how many people come to the forums posting &quot;hey my order was opened and resealed&quot; kind of thread, and then they describe, in detail what the contents were, etc. <br /><br />At least, that&#039;s what I&#039;d do. Come back as someone else if you want to continue to be on the forums after it&#039;s all said and done.

There were many discussions about this in the &quot;shipping&quot; category, including stuff from post office workers and all, and in the end everyone agreed that using fake names led to package being returned or being suspicious as the fake name was not associated to the address otherwise; even to the postman it may seem odd like if he know that you&#039;re single he may flag your delivery as suspicious if he sees a strange package all of a sudden with a new recipient name... or have things changed since last time I checked?

Anyway, long story short, I ended up in the hospital. A blood test revealed that I had coke in my system. The hospital turned my wallet and cellphone (while I was unconscious) over to homeland security. I (being an idiot) had texted a buddy of mine saying &quot;omg bro I just blew through Miami International Airport with an eight ball in my pocket.&quot; I ended up on an ambulance plane back to the US where I spent about two weeks in the Psyc ward of John Hopkins. At the same time I had a package delivered to my house. I obviously had to tell my father about the package since I figured homeland security would find out otherwise. Anyway, they came to his office to &quot;speak&quot; to him. That is all my father told me. All I know is that he turned the package over to them and that two weeks later I got my phone and wallet back. They gave my father a print out of my texts.<br /><br />What do you think my father said to them? How come I was never arrested? My father won&#039;t tell me what he said or did. He is an affluent business man in a large metropolitan city. He is very straightforward and very ethical. Do you think homeland security just let it go? If so, why? Do you think they are watching me now? I&#039;ve been silly and texted some dumb things since. Should I be concerned? I&#039;ve had packages sent to me since and nothing has been intercepted.<br /><br />hmmm? thoughts, feelings?<br /><br />

If they have dna, why tell the suspect.. the cops will act that you are doing yourself a favor by telling them what they want to hear.. It makes me sick when I hear them tell a suspect &quot;If you tell us know, it will make it better on you in the long run&#039; and when they leave the room they high five each other and charge their suspects with first degree murder, so how did admitting anything help?<br /><br />Im sure thats what they do in every departments investigations..<br /><br />I would fork out a few hundred bucks to get a lawyer retained and just refer any questions to him/her as you have done nothing wrong...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have watched 48 hours.&nbsp; I love cop shows.&nbsp; But the story or interrogation they usually put them through is based upon the evidence (or circumstantial evidence).&nbsp; It&#039;s almost like talking with the devil (if you are familiar with Christian literature).&nbsp; They will mix lies with the truth to distort your perceptions.&nbsp; They will build a story BASED upon the evidence they have... but will fold several circumstances about what could/have/would/has happened just to watch your emotions and gauge how you react.&nbsp; That&#039;s their only base.&nbsp; Disprove the base evidence (I wasn&#039;t even expecting something in the mail) and ensure no other evidence is presentable (on computer or otherwise) and you are fine.&nbsp; Just clean house ASAP and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; You are in the clear.&nbsp; <br /><br />They may just chalk it up to one of those base drops that have been set up for people as prominent as the mayor in the U.S. (which he is recieveing an undisclosed settlement for over $3 mil now).<br /><br />Your other option would be to walk in with a lawyer.&nbsp; They already presume your guilty at this point but you&#039;ll most likely get off because the lawyer will protect you and prove there is no evidence without a probable cause, presuming this is all they have called you in for.&nbsp; <br /><br />From here you&#039;re on their watch list, although free to go.&nbsp; At this point you have no choice but to lay low.&nbsp; Don&#039;t order off of SR anymore.&nbsp; Consider Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in a van across your house just waiting for you to F&#039; up for a week or two.<br /><br />Also, my only opposition to Pine&#039;s, or others ideas of not responding at all.&nbsp; That will put you on an even closer watch list.&nbsp; So either way, you have to lay low.<br /><br />You&#039;re choice...all ways are risky but if you follow any the above you will probably be safe from the cops this time...<br /><br />Just my thoughts, don&#039;t want to step on anyone&#039;s toe&#039;s about saying lawyer up or don&#039;t respond...<br /><br />Best of luck you you<br />

				As a generally polite person, I have a hard time swallowing the &#039;just say nothing, except &#039;May I call a lawyer please&#039;&quot; scenario when I play it out in my head, so here&#039;s a few things I thought of.<br /><br />Be extremely polite, smiling, yes sir/no sir, relaxed.<br /><br />Pretend it&#039;s a game, if you repeat the same things over and over again (lawyer please), then you win, at a minimum, 1000$ (just ballparking the cost of a decent lawyer to show up in court for you, based on the standard DUI rate I googled). At a maximum, you win a whole bunch of cash (less money spent on legal fees), and maybe even your freedom or your job/school. <br /><br />^<br />That&#039;s a pretty fucking compelling case to endure the pressure of saying &#039;lawyer please&#039; to a few neck-vein-bulging cops who would like nothing more than to gouge your eyes out for your non-compliance. <br /><br />It really helped watching the &#039;don&#039;t talk to cops&#039; youtube videos, as well as the ones about how to handle a police stop/home visit, etc. There really is -zero- that you gain by talking about anything, and less than zero that you gain by being anything less than perfectly polite. I have a lot of respect for LE, and they are skilled at what they do- I on the other hand, have no idea of the mind games they can pull on me. Sorry, rambling... kittens.

				The problem with police officers is they are no longer encouraged to protect and serve, but to find fault in the citizens of their jurisdiction and punish them. It is all about making arrests and trying to get the biggest bust, so they are automatically pegging you as a criminal instead as a person that they are supposed to be serving for in the best interest for that person.<br /><br />I wish only Bhuddists could become police instead of arrogant redneck assholes that make it so I can&#039;t even enjoy where I live. I am forced to stay inside, because I get harassed almost everytime I go out for a walk and am seen by them, or they park and watch me to intimidate me.<br /><br />Just had to put in my 2 cents about cops.

However, a &quot;serious&quot; case would be felony, and therefore most likely have 12 jurors. Your lawyer and the prosecutor work together to pick jury&#039;s (as you know). Your lawyer (should) have a 6/12 chance of picking the ONE juror needed to nullify.<br /><br />I&#039;d take those odds over 25-life any day. Depending on my location. This will start to come into play soon I believe in MJ cases in states where the majority (and therefore (theoretically) the &quot;majority&quot; of jurors) support either decrimilization or voted for MMJ.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always wanted to sit on a jury too. Only been called once, MANY years ago. Did not get picked. :(<br /><br />There are many sites online explaining how to increase your odds of being picked. Read up on them. Always show up for jury duty if requested. Exercise your rights, (maybe) &quot;seriously&quot; save someones ass, and raise awareness in the process. :)<br /><br />Agreed as well with your other sentencing comments. Our legal system is FAR from perfecct, but I&#039;d still rather be on trial for drug charges here than in many other countries.<br /><br />Where it&#039;s just &quot;off with your head&quot;, ya know?<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

It goes something like this:<br /><br />Crime, at least of certain stripes, does not occur in the morning. Specifically, it does not occur between the times of 6AM and 12 noon. Let&#039;s call it the &#039;children of the night&#039; hypothesis. In the morning, a young man slouch-walking to the shop for breakfast wearing a hoody, nobody notices him. But at 2AM, all that changes, and he&#039;s carefully watched or avoided on the streets. <br /><br />Why? Beats me. There is no logical justification for the belief per say. But most people, including the police, instinctively appear to believe this. Perhaps it is even generally true. Perhaps young men are more likely to drink later in the day, become loud, brash and prone to violence. Maybe they also believe in this hypothesis in some way, because it is expected. But such examples of mass psychology give an arbitrage point to those who operate against the current. Anytime there is a difference between belief and truth, you can use it against your enemy. I think the Roman&#039;s typically attacked at dawn, maybe they knew people were more fearful then, slower to react.<br /><br />One group of people who have clearly mastered this concept are the professional thieves, that is why the majority of burglaries occur in the morning or early afternoon. People&#039;s psychological defenses and perception of risk, apparently has some link to the the level of luminosity.<br /><br />Think of it. More violent crime occurs in the summer because of the higher temperatures, yet because of the light levels in the northern hemisphere, people are more paranoid about it in the winter. You should then expect to see the opposite pattern emerging in the southern hemisphere (so, it is dangerous to average out your expectations here because it wouldn&#039;t reach the correct conclusion). Weird. I would wager good money you can also derive a fair approximate of a cities average crime rate by measuring the average distance between street lamps and their brightness.<br /><br />

I used a particular city as an example. This city thought it could cut electric costs by turning off street lamps. Critics outcried claiming crime rates would increase. In the end, nothing actually happened to the crime rates and in some areas crime decreased.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL, that fits with my hypothesis that daylight has little to do with a reduction in crime or visa versa. I would however, have thought that the perception of crime would have influenced the perpetrators of it e.g. the broken window theory that LE has, so that removing street lamps would have given brash young men more confidence to mug people, simply because that&#039;s what everybody expected them to do. Perhaps in reality muggers like to see what they&#039;re doing in case they get mugged :D

				Why would anyone take time out of their day to go speak to the police? It isnt mandatory. DONT GO and do something productive instead, ie. smoke methamphetamine and create macaroni necklaces. ;D

				I also feel (if this hasn&#039;t already been stated) that you should most likely never receive another package to that address ever again. Chances are you got a nosy postman, regardless cancel any future orders if you already haven&#039;t.

				Lawyer immediately and do NOT talk to the cops. Watch this video if you&#039;re unsure about that.<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik<br /><br />Story should be a complete stonewall, you didn&#039;t order anything, you don&#039;t know anything.
