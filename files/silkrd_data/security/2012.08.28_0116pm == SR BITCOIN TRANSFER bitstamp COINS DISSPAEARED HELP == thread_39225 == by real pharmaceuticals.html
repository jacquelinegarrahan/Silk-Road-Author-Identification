I messaged them after I posted before and got a short response from Vendor Support saying that they are working on it. Probably not worth messaging them because it just wastes their time, but hopefully it does get fixed today. I do wonder if they&#039;ll send the money out or bounce it back into the SR account at this point?

				I got the same thing.<br />Tried to withdraw 20 btc&#039;s and they disappeared with no sign on blockchain.<br />I thought I&#039;d made a mistake so tried 10 more and the same thing happened.<br />I did message vendor support before I saw this thread, no word yet.<br />Not as bad as 200 but 30 is enough to lose.<br />

				Hello , My biggest worry is the potential for loss in value of BTC , for instance today 10&nbsp; BTC are worth just over $100 but tomorrow it might be worth $70. <br /><br />i want to know whether it will be bounced back to account or sent to destination address , i got another message this morning ,<br /><br />&quot;Dear Real Pharmaceuticals,<br /><br />This is an automated message to all sellers at Silk Road :<br /><br />Unfortunately some withdrawals were not processed correctly over the past couple of days. Please double check your withdrawals and report any that did not make it to their intended destination to Vendor Support. Include the amount, time, and destination address of any missing withdrawals. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road Vendor Support&quot;<br /><br />So hopefully they be fixing it today . <br /><br />Kind regards <br /><br />RP<br /><br />
