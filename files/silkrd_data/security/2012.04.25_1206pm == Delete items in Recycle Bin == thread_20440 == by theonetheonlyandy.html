				Once you delete some data on an NTFS/FAT filesystem (valid for many others as well) - it is not really removed, only the link (a file record) is purged. Basically, the reference is gone, but the content persists. This is typical behavior for a wide variety of filesystems. Meaning, you only need to recreate the link, so that you could get to the data. Various utilities are capable of successfully performing such operations (&quot;testdisk&quot; / &quot;photorec&quot; suite for Debian, &quot;GetDataBack&quot; for Windows, etc).<br /><br />The reason this happens is that once you delete a file, the occupying space (content) is simply declared as free - it is not overwritten. The OS might use this space in order to save another file, when it receives an instruction to do so. Or, it might save it at another location (that is free, of course). This is also what causes fragmentation.<br /><br />Take a look at this utility:<br /><br />http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897443<br /><br />One of its features is to &quot;clean&quot; free space (option -c) - what it does is zero-fill the according sectors. This should achieve what you&#039;re looking for and is pretty secure. The only downside to it, is that it might take a noticeable amount of time to complete on a HDD - but that is largely dependant on the &quot;unallocated&quot; space left on the device in question.

Perhaps, you could provide proof to back up this claim? A single run of &quot;sdelete&quot; should be sufficient from what I know. ATA SE is only suitable for full surface wipes.

				First, it does seem that a single pass with random data is enough to securely erase data. This was widely debated for quite a while (in the computer forensics community at that), but today all the literature I can find supports this, as far as modern hard drive platters are concerned anyway. However, there are two things to take into consideration<br /><br />A. Only parts of the drive that are overwritten are overwritten.<br /><br />This should go without saying. And there is a nice paper...somewhere (maybe I will dig it up later if nobody else has a link on hand) that discusses how normal hard drive wiping software (ie: with no firmware component) can not put the head off the center of the track, leaving magnetic residue that is not actually overwritten along the edge of the track. Even if a file leaves only trace amounts of magnetic residue after it is wiped, in some cases it could be enough to recover partial data (and in some cases partial data is all that is required to determine the entire file that was wiped if there is a reference, at least to a high probability, fuzzy hashing comes to mind). ATA secure erase has a firmware component that allows it to wipe off track center.<br /><br />B. Only parts of the drive that are overwritten are overwritten<br /><br />This should go without saying. And depending on your filesystem, you never really know where all traces of files are going to leak to. So even if you wipe the file itself, are you sure you wiped all remnants of it ? Probably not, unless you wipe the entire drive.

What can I tell you on this. First of all, please refer to this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15952<br /><br />As I have already stated the majority of the essential information surrounding this thematic, in there. There&#039;s plenty of links provided. I believe you are still slightly off on the facts, because even a single pass with just 0&#039;s (NUL / 0x00 bytes) is enough to securely erase data, irrecoverably. Not with a random pattern. It adds nothing more to the process. <br /><br />The original research by Gutmann is severely outdated and obsolete, in regards to the modern day storage. In fact, it is obsolete for a decade. Writing density and the data recording technology have changed quite a bit. It is extremely unlikely (basically impossible) to recover any data with a magnetic-force microscope (after it has been zero-filled) - the error rate is ridiculous to a point, where you simply can not make any sense of the presumably acquired data.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method<br /><br />You are right by saying, that this has seen a lot of debate and controversy, mostly due to the vast amount of myths and misconceptions, that still flourish today. Anyway, a good computer forensics expert should also be a good hard drive repair specialist. And in the midst of such - this is known for ages, so I&#039;m not sure who debated this for quite a while, probably just beginners or hopeless theorists in the field, I guess.<br /><br />Regarding your point A - I would really like to look at that paper. Evaluate it and assess its validity. Because so far it sounds very vague. There&#039;s a lot of sites/papers flowing around that even still misinterpret the Gutmann&#039;s method for today&#039;s use. <br /><br />&quot;can not put the head off the center of the track, leaving magnetic residue that is not actually overwritten along the edge of the track&quot; - um, honestly, I would say &quot;what&quot;. The track itself consists of servo data (embedded for the modern day) , that compose the actual sectors with positioning metadata (so physically, a sector is not really 512B in size). So I don&#039;t see where is the buildup of the &quot;magnetic residue&quot; going to happen on the &quot;edge of the track&quot;, especially with perpendicular recording. In fact, I don&#039;t see how the heads are even supposed to be doing anything on the &quot;edge of the track&quot;. Like I said - seems very vague and stinks of unproven theoretical speculations.<br /><br />http://ultraparanoid.wordpress.com/2007/09/12/securely-erase-hard-drives/<br /><br />If we look at the paragraph from here:<br /><br />&quot;In the paper, the reader is led to believe that ATA-SE can wipe the off-track areas of the HDD platters while BEWTs cannot. The actual phrasing in the paper is:”It is difficult for external software to reliably sanitize user data stored on a hard disk drive. [...] Off-track overwrites could be effective in some drives, but there is no such drive external command for a software utility to move heads offtrack.“While it is certainly true that BEWTs cannot write to off-track areas, ATA-SE cannot overwrite off-track areas either. ATA-SE does a single on-track erasure of the data on the disk drive&quot;<br /><br />Regarding your point B - you can be sure if you know how your filesystem works. That is why &quot;sdelete&quot; also cleans the MFT. I think there is little point to make assumptions here, it is of our best interest to talk facts, instead. But generally I agree with this statement, except that it loses its charm when the filesystem has been thoroughly researched.

				An excellent post, thank you 0x00, I had always wanted more information about the Gutmann thread.<br /><br />I too was a fan of Heidi Eraser back in the day but the point is moot in any case. A detailed forensic analysis of your hard drive may indeed reveal deleted files on an unencrypted file system however using a Full Disk Encryption program like Truecrypt negates this problem entirely as all free space is filled with random &quot;chaff&quot; data.<br /><br />As such I suggest we take the attitude that prevention is better than cure and say to the OP that this shouldn&#039;t be an issue as your file system should be encrypted anyway! :)<br /><br />V.

				If you&#039;re really worried about whether or not your files are recoverable you might want to use an operating system that&#039;s more secure.&nbsp; Tails, Liberte Linux, or the use of a virtual machine will at least give you a good chance of keeping your data safe from recovery.&nbsp;

				i use tail and liberte. but before the forums was here the forums was in SR. So i just used the bundle. and i know that is in the hhd somewhere and i just want to scrub it just in case. im going to try Sdelete and see how that works. thanks for the help guys.

Then a random bits overwrite,<br />the same signal averaging, and saved as waveform 2.
