				Just wondering if anyone else noticed that some of the info that&#039;s on the ZipZap form you have to print out has changed anything about wither the wal-mart or 711 method of moneygram cash deposit. I noticed there isn&#039;t a recieve code anymore and I think the other number was referred to something other than what it&#039;s usually called also.

				I have no idea, I hope it works out for you. At this point, I feel like I would recommend any method that involves a cash deposit at a bank. Seems like bitinstant is asking too many questions now and might turn into an organization that would cooperate with LE.

				Good to hear that everything worked out for you. I know I always check the numbers too when I print out a form. The process of moving money can be a pain sometimes but Bitinstant with ZipZap has actually been simple and fast for me. It seems that there&#039;s always issues with someone, I guess eventually it&#039;ll happen but so far it&#039;s been very smooth. Possibly like you said you made a mistake initially but nonetheless I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on it.

				Just got coins today and the form looked like it always has in the past and had the receive code listed as well as account number. <br /><br />&nbsp;Just and FYI- I have purchased BTC in the past through my blockchain account and they go through BitINstant.&nbsp; Today, I had to enter my &quot;name&quot; so BitInstant could do their terrorist money check that they started a couple months back. But a couple weeks ago, I bought BTC the same way with using Blockchain and they never asked for my &quot;name&quot;.&nbsp; It was a way to skirt the BitInstant check as the name was not required when BTC were purchased this way.&nbsp; It seems as though BitInstant has caught on and now require the name of the person buying BTC through their link.<br />&nbsp; I was just wondering if other BTC wallet sites might have something similar--- where you can buy BTC to be sent to your wallet, but use BitINstant through a link on their page, thereby bypassing the name requirement? If you only went to BitINstant&#039;s website and bought BTC with a cash purchase; there is no way to get around giving your &quot;name&quot; as it is required for the transaction to progress.&nbsp;

				Just use fake information. There is no need to use your real name. <br /><br />I dont know what the form looked like before. How is the one they use now different. <br /><br />You don&#039;t actually give the form to anyone. You just use it to transfer information to the blue moneygram form. <br /><br />So far it is working fine for me. Only bad thing is the fees and you dont get the best price for coins.

				yeah it seems like zip zap&#039;s exchange rate is a bit higher than the mtgox rate.. then there&#039;s the $3.95 wire fee, plus 3.99%.. on $500, that&#039;s $23.90 you&#039;d pay in fees.. and you the exchange rate is lower than mtgox, so you&#039;d realistically end up with something like $468ish. that&#039;s about a 6.4% overall fee, which is high to me.

				I&#039;ve been with bit instant through it all. Been using them since I first ventured down the lovely road. You guys are being way paranoid. For the cautious intelligent user bit instant is the absolute best route. I&#039;ve not heard bad things about blue sky I just don&#039;t trust using a vendor for bit coins. If you follow a few simple easy steps you can use bitinstant and remain totally anonymous. <br /><br />1. never use your personal computer for bitinstant try to use a public computer or at minimum a public hot spot.<br />2. create a fake identity. Moneygram does not require an id of any sort for transactions under 900$. Create an identity to use and switch it up every few months. Also switch up where you do money gram.<br />3. you can send your coins through bit instant strait to SR address. people will advise against this its not that big of a deal if your following steps 1 and 2. SR has a built in coin fogger so your coins are always fogging plus you can change you SR address multiple times for free.<br />4. Don&#039;t be a paranoid twat! you are doing nothing illegal purchasing bit coins!<br /><br />to sum it up you can remain entirely anonymous through bit instant, even with the new birth date and name feature its really just for show. I&#039;ve been using bit instant this way with no snags for at least 6 months.

				Just to give an update, I used bitinstant a few days ago and it worked fine. I definitely fucked up and selected the wrong payment method(eg. not moneygram) from that first drop down list on the page where you fill out the BTC wallet addy and all that.<br /><br />Also, just to pass on some positive info about bitinstant, I fucked up that day and could have lost a good deal of money. I had printed out a form 2 days before I was going to pay for it, and had since used BlueSky to deposit a few coins. I ALWAYS change my wallet address after making a deposit, so my old one associated with the zipzap form wouldn&#039;t have worked. I tried going through with the transaction, totally forgetting about the fact that I had a new wallet address, but thankfully, bitintstant(or zipzap, idk) must have been able to realize that the destination wallet was no longer valid, and rejected my transaction.

You are using moneygram to pay a bill via zip zap&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Your actually buying bit coins but the teller doesn&#039;t know that. She can&#039;t see what you are buying or paying. If you didn&#039;t have zip zap you would have to use moneygram directly to bitinstant in which case the name alone would give you away and make you feel less safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course, but usually the form has zip zap&#039;s information on it - a receive code and an account number. And I know that the cashier doesn&#039;t see what I&#039;m buying, only that I&#039;m paying a bill. I just need to actually get back to that correct receipt.

				I have successfully used bitinstant, zip zap,&nbsp; walmart, blockchain several times.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Usually it is sitting there waiting on me when I log on to check.&nbsp; &nbsp; Today,&nbsp; about 4 hours ago, did the same,&nbsp; Got all my confirm emails,&nbsp; like always,&nbsp; but no coins yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;4 hours!!!!<br /><br />Double checked the wallet addy, spot on,&nbsp; so... zip zap confirms, but nothing on blockchain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has anyone had this before?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Like I said,&nbsp; I have several flawless doing this.&nbsp; &nbsp;This time,&nbsp; &nbsp;my shiny 500 dollar bill is missing in space somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoping its slow day or something.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />* update *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;apparently when you send the same amount more then once within say 24 hours,&nbsp; it gets hung up as a double or fraud thing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Long story short, I will be waiting until monday now for them to manually fix it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to bitinstant support

				Sometimes it does take longer than expected. Are you sure you gave the right address for your wallet. <br /><br />Did you use the same information for both deposits. This is just a guess but they do have a daily limit. Perhaps the second deposit will go through after midnight.

				you think what you want, we try to help no reason to BS. then you tell us why downtime few months ago and when some back no bank deposit and new AML policy + name/dob required for new OFAC check when place order. one day owner wake up and think we need to cut back limit and add new OFAC check for government?? hahaha. ok you think that.<br /><br />all company under US area can be audit/check/search by FBI at anytime when doing money transfers, all we say is wash coin very good, not say don&#039;t use, person decide own risk profile.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We&#039;ve re-opened two of our &quot;Pay to&quot; options on BitInstant.com:<br /><br />1) Bitcoin to email (receive BTC directly to your email address)<br /><br />2) Bitcoin address (receive BTC directly to your Bitcoin account)<br /><br />While customers will be happy to see these options return, please note that BitInstant will now be doing &quot;OFAC&quot; checks on cash deposit orders that go through these methods. OFAC (stands for &quot;Office of Foreign Asset Control&quot;) checks require a customer&#039;s full name and date of birth. This information is checked against a &quot;blacklist&quot; managed by the US Department of the Treasury. This blacklist includes people for whom US companies are not allowed to process transactions, primarily due to alleged or proven criminal or terrorist activity.<br /><br />As BitInstant is continually working to operate in full compliance with US law, the company now requires this additional information before processing any orders that use the Bitcoin to email or Bitcoin address as a &quot;Pay to&quot; method. In the interest of transparency, we&#039;ve also updated the BitInstant Privacy Policy to reflect this new change.<br /><br />You can read more about OFAC checks here.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
