				Title: <strong>Tor Bridges and why you should use them</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>vlad1m1r</strong> on <strong>June 16, 2012, 03:06 pm</strong>

				Dear all,<br /><br />After tentatively making enquiries to see if anyone was interested in using a private Tor bridge I plan to set up in Belize for a small fee I received a few messages asking for further info about bridges in general.<br /><br />If you want an in depth explanation I suggest you take a look at the information and video on the Tor Project site : https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges<br /><br />TLDR : Although Tor does its best to mingle itself in with your regular SSL traffic, the data packets are apparently quite easy to detect (I&#039;ve not done this myself but have some learned friends!).<br /><br />Bridges are Tor Relays which are not listed in the main Tor directory. As such connecting to them make it much more difficult for your ISP or sinister government organisations to filter your Tor traffic.<br /><br />You might need to use bridges if :<br /><br />- You live in a country where ISPs are required to block Tor traffic.<br />- Your ISP blocks Tor traffic anyway.<br />- You live in a place where not many people use Tor/The internet and don&#039;t want to be traced due to being one of the few IP addresses in this area. (This is the reason I use bridges).<br />- You live in a country like the UK where ISP&#039;s are required to record certain parts of your internet traffic such as IP&#039;s to which you&#039;ve connected and you don&#039;t want it revealed you were using Tor at a later date in case it&#039;s used against you in court e.g you try to deny that you knew a package you accepted into your home contained drugs and want your internet activity not to show you&#039;ve been using Tor hidden services.<br /><br />You can view the latest publicly available bridges by going to https://bridges.torproject.org/ - please note that these are not as secure as private bridges as in the nature of things more people know about them - for instance the Police could write these down every day for all we know! This is the reason I was asking about interest in a private bridge but the jury is still out on that one!<br /><br />Once you have your list, go to Vidalia and click Settings. Next click &#039;Network&#039; and check the box which says &#039;My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network. <br /><br />You can then enter the details of the bridges below to begin using them. Just copy and paste them one at a time from the https://bridges.torproject.org/ page e.g 87.105.190.103:444 - press the &#039;+&#039; button each time to add each bridge.<br /><br />Your connection is more secure the more bridges you use so make sure you update your list of bridges regularly.<br /><br />As I said the most secure solution is to use a private bridge but naturally you need to make your own arrangements to set this up. If anything comes of my offshore bridge plan I will let you all know.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />

I am hoping to offer this service very soon but need to make sure the service is reliable first!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

This is incredibly easy for them and means anyone who wants to connect to Tor and get completely free internet needs to use a private or unknown bridge of some kind. They also need to use traffic ghosting techniques, such as making Tor traffic look like an MSN chat or email.<br /><br />B) UK in 2013 - The government is currently passing legislation meaning all internet activity will need to be kept recorded for at least 1 year. This will go through in 2013. This means that from then onwards, the police, hell even the NHS or your council will be able to look back if they want to at your internet traffic records and see that 11months 6 days ago at 14:03 you were connected to the Tor network. This could be used against you in a court of law if you were found with illegal materials in your house, such as the anarchists cook book or use your imagination...

				the uk in 2013 is going to be a scary place! <br />Sorry if I am being dense here but even if the police kick down the door and find illegals under my bed what has that got to do with my internet access? I may well have been using tor at 14.03 but they sure as hell don&#039;t know what I was doing (unless they have cracked tor and are keeping schtum about it?). Proving I used tor is a long way from linking me to ordering drugs, worse case scenario is posession. Or am I missing something obvious?

My feeling is that we should be making preparations for 2013 here and now as no doubt ISP&#039;s will be setting up systems for deep packet monitoring etc. this year to try them out, if they haven&#039;t done so already...<br /><br />Anyway, you&#039;re absolutely right in saying if your home is raided and you&#039;re found in possession of controlled drugs this in itself would be the crime and whether you used Tor or not wouldn&#039;t make a difference to your sentence. However, if you receive a package to your home containing illegal goods and are arrested for it and subsequently try to claim that you had no idea what was inside it, the fact that you used Tor could be used as evidence against you.<br /><br />Moreover as the Silk Road gains in popularity I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if LEO start to single out people using Tor for extra surveillance which will now be possible thanks to this rather draconian legislation.<br /><br />All of this underpins the need to use a bridge - public ones if you must but any level of protection is better than none at all!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If you go round to those IP&#039;s houses, you&#039;ve got a much higher rate of finding something than a random house.<br /><br />3) Police profit!!<br />

Obfsproxy was an “ace up our sleeve,” as Appelbaum described it, and Tor put it into action over the past few days despite its user interface being a bit rough…<br /><br />On Friday, Appelbaum put out the call to the Tor community to start running obfsproxy bridges. He warned that the software is not easy to set up, that it might be effective for only a few days “at the rate the arms race is progressing,” and that people who set up bridges need to either contact the Tor Project or share the bridge addresses directly with users who need them.&quot;<br /><br />Source : http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/02/14/tor-offers-way-for-iranians-to-beat-new-censorship-clampdown/?mod=google_news_blog<br /><br />So can I take it from this that using an obfuscated bridge encrypted traffic does appear to be regular traffic or does Applebaum have it wrong? <br /><br />As for people sharing these bridges it seems to be positively encouraged.<br /><br />As for OZ, he has a Masters in IT Security. You call him a &quot;technobabble spouting idiot&quot; - a textbook case of the pot calling the kettle black in humble opinion but let&#039;s not dwell on it...<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Another issue I just though of with protocol obfuscators like obfsproxy, although this wouldn&#039;t really affect the UK or US, but may affect places like Iran or Morocco, is that you may cause suspicious spikes and volumes of traffic in protocols that are rarely used in your country or area, highlighting yourself to the government more not less. This is be particularly prevalent if you were a novice user and didn&#039;t know which options to choose properly in obfsproxy and chose something you thought sounded random, but really puts you in more risk.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I will leave OscarZulu to decide whether your understanding of node enumeration attacks is correct.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would be hesitant listening to oscarzulu, some of what he says is correct but he gets a lot of things wrong too. I highly doubt that he has a masters in IT security considering some of the extremely stupid shit he has said, like it being possible to brute force 13 character passwords in minutes, or BSD being a type of Linux (for two examples). Most of what Shannon said is correct. One thing I disagree with, public bridges are not safer than private bridges. However, it is an extremely bad idea to use private bridges that you get on an illegal forum like silk road, and using public bridges would be better than using such a private bridge. Not only do you give your IP address to the person running the bridge, you also give your IP address to anyone who monitors the bridge after determining its IP address. Normally it wouldn&#039;t matter that the person running the bridge knows your IP address, but if they know who you are and the illegal sites you visit then you pretty much are deanonymizing yourself to them and any potential feds that learn the &#039;private&#039; bridges IP address. Also, I know you mean well, but it is not that offensive for Shannon to point out that feds have engaged in similar tactics many times in the past, running private VPNs only advertised on carder forums in order to scoop up IP addresses of the people who visit carder forums. <br /><br />Shannon is correct in saying that you should use less bridges. For someone in China, more is better. Because they want to have one that is not blocked at all times, and the more they have the less likely all of them will be blocked. They use bridges for censorship evasion. We use bridges for membership concealment. The more bridges you use, the more likely one of them will be owned by an attacker, and thus the more likely the attacker will be able to determine your IP address is using the Tor network. Additionally, using more than three bridges at a time makes you significantly weaker to end point timing attacks than using Tor without bridges and with the standard number of entry guards selected (3). <br /><br />The reason to use bridges is indeed what oscar said (wow I guess even a broken clock can be right sometimes). Let&#039;s say a vendor lives in a remote rural area. They leak their rough geolocation to customers every time they ship a package. If they ship to law enforcement and law enforcement can get a list of Tor client IP addresses (numerous ways to do this), then they can come to the conclusion that the one Tor client in the middle of nowhere is probably the vendor who just sent them drugs from the middle of nowhere. Even if you live in a more densely populated area, law enforcement could still narrow you down to maybe a few hundred IP addresses. Pretty much any crowd size reduction is bad, and should be avoided. You want to use protocol obfuscators because they strongly compliment bridges, bridges can hide the fact that you are connecting to Tor relays based on IP addresses, but it can not hide that the traffic you are sending has a fingerprint that is consistent with Tor traffic.<br /><br />Also you misunderstood Shannon when he/she pointed out that a bridge doesn&#039;t hide Tor traffic patterns. It is true that bridges do not hide Tor traffic patterns. This is why they made obfsproxy. Obfsproxy hides Tor traffic patterns, and is used IN ADDITION to bridges which hide that you are connecting to Tor relay IP addresses.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If someone was to configure only a few bridges, which lets get real, most people here will do, then forget about it and only be left with one working until that dies which is when they will reconfigure it again as they will realise their Tor isn&#039;t working, well from my perspective (having done it before) someone using only one bridge is like a godsend to pinpointing someone using endpoint timing correlation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Another example of Oscar saying stupid shit. Oscar, end point timing correlation requires the attacker to be able to monitor entry and exit of traffic. If you use multiple entry points you are increasing your exposure. In fact, using two entry points instead of one doubles the risk of being pwnt by an end to end correlation attack. Regular Tor used three entry points which rotate every month to two months, I believe that you should configure bridges in a similar way (use three at a time, and change them every month to two months). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To an extent this is true, personally I think Silk Road needs to set up a private bridge for us all to use which we can trust as it would be self defeating for them to allow it to be breached.

Several hosts accept E-currency like Pecunix and Liberty Reserve. A few hosts accept Bitcoin. Many hosts accept money wires such as WU or bank wires. You can send bank wires and money wires anonymously by using exchangers, for example buying bitcoins, mixing them and then converting them to pecunix and cashing it out via an exchanger for a western union or bank wire to the name / account of the hosting provider. Of course the entire time you pretend that the exchanger is you to the host and that the host is you to the exchanger. Additionally, pretty much every host accepts credit cards and there are virtual credit card services that can be funded with various E-currencies. These services issue you credit card information that can be used at merchants online, but they do not give you a physical card. Unlinq was one popular provider but they have shut down, I am sure there are still several virtual credit card providers though. Here is one place offering virtual credit card, I have NO IDEA if they are scammers or not though: http://ptclub.com/virtual_cc.html ... here is another that I also have no idea about the legitimacy of .... http://yacgplus.com/virtual-credit-cards/

				you can try, but I doubt is any one will use it. more easy to subscribe to some VPN service run by Russians or Ukrainians and for $15 per months you will have 10 vpn servers in different countries to rotate. and traffic not TOR.

				I have a few questions, seeing as though there are quite a few knowledgeable people in this thread. :-)<br /><br />If I am using TOR, which you say is quite visible to my ISP,&nbsp; would it prompt the local LE to investigate my TOR usage further? Or is it only after a delivery of mine has been intercepted that they then look into these areas to gather evidence?<br /><br />Before I got here and read about various security measures that should be taken, in regards to anything SR related, I searched alot about SR and Bitcoins on the clearnet. Would this put me at risk of being monitored for anything arriving in the mail? <br /><br />I noticed that Vlad1m1r posted a recommendation to use Shellmix a few pages back to access exchanges such as Mt Gox and the like. Could it be possible to tunnel my TOR traffic through Shellmix to hide the fact that I&#039;m using TOR? <br /><br />What if it is a particularly sunny day and the light is bouncing off my tinfoil hat, sending a beam of light into the sky and notifying the LE of my overly paranoid disposition. Would that cause my address to be flagged? <br /><br />Just waiting on my first batch of BTC to arrive and will be ordering soon. So forgive me if I am asking overly paranoid and stupid questions :-)

				Just set up your own bridge. Purchase shell access/VPS on some offshore server using e-currency or a prepaid credit card, then install a tor bridge on port 443. Keep changing servers and/or use VPNs to connect to tor, and mix in a few public bridges along with the private one from time to time. Don&#039;t do anything at regular intervals; keep shit random! Also, open wifi FTW!!! &lt;--- don&#039;t forget to randomize your MAC addresses if using wifi!!

				Guys, first of all --&nbsp; The guy who suggested we all use a private silk-road only tor bridge is obviously a fed or intelligence agent.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whoever connects to the Tor Bridge would be exposing their source IP address, as well as exposing themselves to timing attacks if the Tor Bridge is a hostile node.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bad idea.<br /><br />Second...&nbsp; There seems to be some misunderstanding on Private Tor Bridges, Public Tor Bridges, and Entry Guards.<br /><br />A Tor Bridge is a method of entering the Tor Network via non-standard methods...&nbsp; The original point of Tor Bridges was to let people in repressive countries like China get on Tor...&nbsp; Since the repressive regimes had lists of the standard nodes (IP points of entry)&nbsp; on the Tor network,&nbsp; &nbsp;they blocked the published Tor IPs and ports, and thus, their population could not get on Tor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tor Bridges were intended as a way around this censorship, not as a method of increasing anonymity or concealing membership.&nbsp; Tor Bridges are thus a &#039;non-published&#039; list of points of entry into Tor.<br /><br />In terms of the two types, Public Tor Bridge vs Private Tor Bridge...<br /><br />A Public Tor Bridge is a method of circumventing censorship and getting on Tor...&nbsp; it is published in the Tor Bridge email directory, and can be given out to users who request access.&nbsp; It is less public than the list of Tor exit nodes, but it is still available.<br /><br />A Private Tor Bridge is the exact same thing, the only difference being that it is NOT published in any directory.&nbsp; The only way people can use a private Tor bridge is if they are told about it , and know the specific IP address, port, and fingerprint.<br /><br />NOW HERE IS THE CATCH:&nbsp; &nbsp;If you use a Tor bridge to get on Tor, ONE LAYER OF THE ONION IS REMOVED.&nbsp; &nbsp; IF YOU USE A TOR BRIDGE, YOU DO NOT GET ENTRY GUARDS.&nbsp; You still only get 3 onion hops to your destination.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In Tor Default configuration, your circuit to an internet site looks like this:<br /><br />You -&gt; Entry Guard&nbsp; -&gt; Onion Router -&gt; Exit Node-&gt; Destination On Internets<br /><br /><br />When you use a Tor Bridge, it looks like this:<br /><br />You -&gt; Tor Bridge -&gt; Onion Router -&gt; Exit Node -&gt; Destination On Internets<br /><br /><br />Currently, the use of Tor Bridges should be avoided for purposes of increasing anonymity.&nbsp; They do not increase your anonymity except under very specific circumstances.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Correct me if I&#039;m wrong here, folks, but this is my understanding of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;---***--- <br /><br />1) If you use Tor Bridges to enter the Tor network,&nbsp; you do not get the security benefit of Entry Guards.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2) Whatever Tor Bridge (or Bridges) you choose to use get your IP as the first hop into the network.<br />3) You do not get the security benefits of 30-90 day Entry Guard rotation that is in the default Tor protocol.&nbsp; There are no Entry Guards if you use Bridges to get on Tor.<br />&nbsp;<br />Realistically, the only &#039;safe&#039; way to use a Tor Bridge is to set up multiple anonymous (and PRIVATE) ones for yourself via an anonymous hosting provider , and then use those.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NEVER use a Tor Bridge or Entry Guard suggested to you by someone on the forums , or SR.<br /><br />Hopefully in future releases of the Tor protocol , it will support the use of private bridges and entry guards together to increase security.<br /><br />You -&gt; Private Bridge -&gt; Entry Guard -&gt; Onion Router -&gt; Onion Router -&gt; Destination on Internets<br /><br />Until then, and unless you have set up you own anonymous private bridges, you are better off using default Tor config.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And lastly, anyone that tells you to pool into any single Tor resource (like a &quot;Silk Road&quot; bridge, lol, what a joke) is either an idiot or a federalie.<br /><br /><br /><br />

This isn&#039;t an issue if you create your own VPN. My thinking on this is you can change your IP often, on the fly with a socks proxy, so if LE did get your ISP to provide information, they wouldn&#039;t see an IP pattern and would have to go through every IP you connect to 1 by 1? Not likely, but the first thing they would likely do is look and see if you connected to any Tor IP&#039;s.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a post from tor-talk that is very similar to my setup:<br />Setup your own Tor VPN. Similar like JanusVM. Really create your own Tor VPN as JanusVM is closed source, unsecure and unmaintained. One virtual machine running Linux will provide a VPN server and forward all traffic trough Tor. Then use another virtual machine which has no direct internet access but lan-only access to the Tor VPN virtual machine. And connect the VPN. After the VPN is running you can add a proxy to firefox. I tested that myself and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately I tested it with JanusVM and not my own Tor VPN, I am still working on that. This setup could be great, Tor is hiding your ass, Tor Browser is well configured, https everywhere helps a bit to stop eavesdropping of exit servers and proxy servers and you might be even able to use the firefox addon steatlhy to comfortable turn on/off some untrusted extra proxy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Fingerprinting is basically that they can see the encrypted traffic and while they can&#039;t see the contents, they can see the size of the contents. So if connecting to SR login page is a specific size file transfer each time, and your IP had the same size file transfer, they can assume you connected to SR. I don&#039;t know for sure, but I don&#039;t believe this has ever been used to convict anyone since it&#039;s conjecture and would be difficult to prove beyond all doubt.

This isn&#039;t an issue if you create your own VPN. My thinking on this is you can change your IP often, on the fly with a socks proxy, so if LE did get your ISP to provide information, they wouldn&#039;t see an IP pattern and would have to go through every IP you connect to 1 by 1? Not likely, but the first thing they would likely do is look and see if you connected to any Tor IP&#039;s.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you&#039;re using an offshore, privacy-oriented VPN then I&#039;m sure your tor traffic will blend in with the other (justly) paranoid users connecting to tor through that service. Better yet, you can just set up your own VPN or SSH tunnel. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here&#039;s a post from tor-talk that is very similar to my setup:<br />Setup your own Tor VPN. Similar like JanusVM. Really create your own Tor VPN as JanusVM is closed source, unsecure and unmaintained. One virtual machine running Linux will provide a VPN server and forward all traffic trough Tor. Then use another virtual machine which has no direct internet access but lan-only access to the Tor VPN virtual machine. And connect the VPN. After the VPN is running you can add a proxy to firefox. I tested that myself and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately I tested it with JanusVM and not my own Tor VPN, I am still working on that. This setup could be great, Tor is hiding your ass, Tor Browser is well configured, https everywhere helps a bit to stop eavesdropping of exit servers and proxy servers and you might be even able to use the firefox addon steatlhy to comfortable turn on/off some untrusted extra proxy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^This is one approach to creating a custom VPN. Just don&#039;t use the same service/server for too long, otherwise it kind of defeats the purpose.

Yes, I know for a fact that you lose Entry Guards if you hop on a Private Bridge.&nbsp; The Private Bridge connects directly to the second hop of the onion on in the Tor Network&nbsp; (followed by the last hop, the exit node if accessing the clearnet, or another hop, then the RP if accessing a hidden service).&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tor project developers are discussing ways around the path/security reduction of Tor Bridges --&nbsp; one way they discussed was to increase the path to 4 hops, but this presented its own set of problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;These issues are discussed over the last 18 months or so on the Tor blog.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only way using Private Bridges instead of Entry Guards is acceptable is if you have set up and purchased your Private Bridge anonymously (perhaps by buying a secure VPS using cleanly washed bitcoins), where the bridge is located in an Western-unfriendly country (Russia, on RBN or something, etc) , and the paper trail for the bridge&#039;s billing cannot be traced back to you.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to also be pretty sure your VPS provider didn&#039;t keep detailed logs, do DPI, of keep track of what was going in and out of their netblock... And if they did keep such logs of your VPS, you&#039;d have to be pretty sure they wouldn&#039;t give these logs up if they received an email on their netblock&#039;s abuse account.&nbsp; Hence, your best bet is something related to the Russian mafia.<br /><br />Then you&#039;d add this Private Bridge to your Tor bridges list , specifying the Private Bridge IP, the port you are running the Tor listener on, and the cryptographic fingerprint of the bridge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Tor client will then always connect through this specific bridge to hop on their Tor network rather than using Entry Guards.&nbsp; <br /><br />You lose the benefit of Entry Guards via this method (Private Bridge), and you lose one-hop in the connection (you only get 3 hops through Tor regardless of what you use),&nbsp; but this tradeoff is probably worth it if your Private Bridge is untraceable and secure.&nbsp; Basically what you gain (by losing Entry Guards) is the 100% GUARANTEE that your first hop into the network is NOT a malicious node.&nbsp; &nbsp;This says nothing of packet monitoring/DPI surrounding your anonymous Private Bridge, and Yes, they&#039;d be able to see you were on Tor with DPI, but there would be no logs on the machine itself, and there would not be the same level of risk that your Entry Guard is malicious.<br /><br />This is the trade-off...&nbsp; By using your own anonymous Private Bridge , you lose Entry Guards, and You lose a bit of path obfuscation --&nbsp; but you gain the near-100% certainty that your Entry Point into Tor is not a malicious actor.&nbsp; You also lose the benefit (and risks) of &#039;rotation&#039;.<br /><br />I think it would also be risky to use a SINGLE private bridge to always enter the Tor network (I do not know enough about this).&nbsp; I think it would be safer to have two or three anonymous Private Bridges under your control, where you add each one to the Videlia private bridge list with the IP, port, and fingerprint.&nbsp; Maybe someone else can comment on the security risks about always using only ONE private bridge to get on Tor, where that Private Bridge does not change for extended periods of time (30 - 90 days).<br /><br />I do not recommend using a Private Bridge for most people (90% of the people on the forums), because there is a high technical level of skill required.&nbsp; You cannot simply ask on SR or the Forums for a &quot;safe private bridge&quot; because that would break your security if you trusted the wrong person.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You&#039;d need to set it up yourself.&nbsp; Anonymously. And Securely.&nbsp; And I think you&#039;d probably need more than one Private Bridge, but I&#039;m not sure about that.<br /><br />The only way to have a &quot;safe private bridge&quot; is to set it up yourself, using anonymous payment methods, locating it in a far-off country, and only using it yourself, (or sharing it with a very select group of trusted people , that you trust 100%.)<br /><br />You&#039;d also have to ensure that not only was the Private Bridge not publishing itself on the Tor Bridge list, but I believe this is just a binary option in torrc.<br /><br />You&#039;d have to make sure that the Operating System running your Private Bridge was secure and hardened, and difficult to break into.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to make sure your Private Bridge wasn&#039;t keeping any log files of your source IP when you SSH into it to administer it, or when you log into the VPS control panel.&nbsp; You&#039;d need to make sure it was actually private, and not publishing a descriptor in the Tor list, as mentioned.<br /><br />So you&#039;d have to completely disable logging on the machine, as well as probably have it wipe free disk space every night.&nbsp; This would begin to approach really nice security, especially if you had multiple Private Bridges on different netblocks / different countries.<br /><br />If you understand and can implement what I&#039;ve just written , you may want to consider the security benefits of an anonymous private bridge(s).&nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise,&nbsp; you are better off using standard Entry Guard methods,&nbsp; with the entry guards stored in the Tor data files, coupled with storing your Tor installation on an encrypted partition or encrypted USB stick.<br /><br />Then cross your fingers that your Entry Guards are not malicious.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Entry Guards do kind of suck , but they are better than using a new (potentially malicous) entry point into the network every single time you start Tor.&nbsp; <br /><br />One last comment, is that if you are running Tor off Tails or Liberte , without persisting the Tor State information, you are putting yourself at risk .&nbsp; You need to have an encrypted partition, either on a hard drive or USB stick , where you can persist the Tor State information of your Entry Guards, so that you are not constantly rotating to new ones on a daily basis (rather than the intended 30-90 day basis)<br /><br />The way you do this (persist Tor state information if using Tails, Liberte, or encrypted USB stick) is to unzip the Tor Browser Bundle to your encrypted partition / USB stick.&nbsp; When you need to get on Tor, mount the encrypted partition, file container , or usb drive, and run Tor Browser (&quot;start-tor-browser&quot;)&nbsp; from the encrypted subdirectory.&nbsp; Doing this will save the Tor state information, Entry Guards and all, on the encrypted drive.&nbsp; Tor will automatically rotate your Entry Guards over approx 30-90 day periods each time your run it.&nbsp; &nbsp;When you are done surfing over Tor, click Stop Tor on Videlia Control Panel, then dismount the encrypted folder.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hope this helps

				Just an added comment, something I didn&#039;t realize previously....<br /><br />Part of my criticism of using private Tor Bridges , (in particular one you set up yourself anonymously), was that you lose the functionality of &quot;Entry Guards&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not the main issue though... the main issue is the _practical reduction in total hops in the circuit path_.&nbsp; &nbsp;A Private Tor Bridge hops directly onto the Tor network, thus , still only gives you 3 hops total (including the Private Bridge!).&nbsp; My contention was that this decrease in realized path (still only 3 hops!) increased your proximity to your target (whether on the clearnet or as a hidden service), and thus, decreases your security on one metric.<br /><br />What I didn&#039;t realize was that Tor lets you configure the default number of hops.&nbsp; &nbsp;My first inclination knowing what I know , would be to encourage those using their own Private Bridges (and even those in censorship countries using Public Bridges) , I&#039;d encourage these people to consider INCREASING their circuit path to 4 hops (rather than the default 3).<br /><br />You would take a performance hit, but I think that this would increase your security, since your first hop into the network (the private bridge) is not really a Tor node per-se , since it is controlled by you, and more or less only routes YOUR traffic, and your traffic alone. <br /><br />As such , I think it probably makes sense to increase your default circuit path to 4 to make up for this, ESPECIALLY if you are only using a single anonymous Private Bridge (of course, under your control) to access Tor.&nbsp; But this probably also applies to anyone using a private Bridge as a method of membership-concealment.<br /><br />The only method I am aware of,&nbsp; to increase your default number of hops&nbsp; (must be done on your Tor client),&nbsp; is to recompile the Tor client source code.&nbsp; <br /><br />Download the source code, and edit the C header file &quot;src/or/or.h&quot; using your favorite text editor.&nbsp; Change the line that says<br /><br />#define DEFAULT_ROUTE_LEN 3<br />to<br />#define DEFAULT_ROUTE_LEN 4 <br /><br />Or modify it to the preference of your choice.&nbsp; Then recompile. I think 4 makes logical sense if you are using an anonymous private bridge, since your first hop is not really a Tor node per se (it&#039;s your own machine).&nbsp; Input is welcome on this issue, but this is just my take on the security here.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Tor developers admit they aren&#039;t sure of the correct number, which is why the left it hardcoded at 3 hops (tradeoff between speed and security).&nbsp; &nbsp;However, for someone who is using an anonymous Private Bridge as their first hop, I think there is a strong argument that can be made for increasing the total circuit length to 4 in this case.<br /><br />If I was using a single anonymous Private Bridge, I&#039;d probably recompile my Tor client to use 4 hops by default. There is not torrc option (as far as I know) , so if you want to increase your path length, you have to recompile your client.<br /><br />Here is what the Tor developers say. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Q: You should let people choose their path length.<br /><br />A: Right now the path length is hard-coded at 3 plus the number of nodes in your path that are sensitive. That is, in normal cases it&#039;s 3, but for example if you&#039;re accessing a hidden service or a &quot;.exit&quot; address it could be 4.<br /><br />We don&#039;t want to encourage people to use paths longer than this -- it increases load on the network without (as far as we can tell) providing any more security. Remember that&nbsp; the best way to attack Tor is to attack the endpoints and ignore the middle of the path.<br /><br />And we don&#039;t want to encourage people to use paths of length 1 either. Currently there is no reason to suspect that investigating a single relay will yield user-destination pairs, but if many people are using only a single hop, we make it more likely that attackers will seize or break into relays in hopes of tracing users.<br /><br />Now, there is a good argument for making the number of hops in a path unpredictable. For example, somebody who happens to control the last two hops in your path still doesn&#039;t know who you are, but they know for sure which entry node you used. Choosing path length from, say, a geometric distribution will turn this into a statistical attack, which seems to be an improvement. On the other hand, a longer path length is bad for usability. We&#039;re not sure of the right trade-offs here. Please write a research paper that tells us what to do. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My take here is that 3 hops is fine as a general case, 4 is preferred for those entering the network via their own anonymous private bridges, and that really the solution here is to follow a geometric distribution of hops to improve security at the expense of usability . YMMV.<br /><br />Lastly, for those who are NOT using Private Bridges (but are instead using the default method of Entry Guards), especially those who are concerned about connecting directly to Tor from home,&nbsp; such as in proto-fascist countries such as the UK, you can increase your security by purchasing an anonymous HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5 proxy in a different country.&nbsp; Preferably a proxy that doesn&#039;t keep logs.&nbsp; Tor lets you tunnel your connections through this proxy.&nbsp; Thus, your ISP would not know you are connecting to Tor unless they conducted DPI .&nbsp; &nbsp;If they logged your outgoing IPs and kept them for a year,&nbsp; &nbsp;they would just see you connecting to a secure proxy.&nbsp; They can&#039;t prove you are accessing Tor, not yet anyway.&nbsp; Just add one of the following options to your Tor Config File (torrc), and/or edit your setting in Videlia Control Panel to connect to Tor through a proxy.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">HTTPSProxy host[:port]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor will make all its OR (SSL) connections through this host:port (or host:443 if port is not specified), via HTTP CONNECT rather than connecting directly to servers. You may want to set FascistFirewall to restrict the set of ports you might try to connect to, if your HTTPS proxy only allows connecting to certain ports.<br /><br />HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If defined, Tor will use this username:password for Basic HTTPS proxy authentication, as in RFC 2617. This is currently the only form of HTTPS proxy authentication that Tor supports; feel free to submit a patch if you want it to support others.<br /><br />Socks4Proxy host[:port]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor will make all OR connections through the SOCKS 4 proxy at host:port (or host:1080 if port is not specified).<br /><br />Socks5Proxy host[:port]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tor will make all OR connections through the SOCKS 5 proxy at host:port (or host:1080 if port is not specified).<br /><br />Socks5ProxyUsername username<br /><br />Socks5ProxyPassword password<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If defined, authenticate to the SOCKS 5 server using username and password in accordance to RFC 1929. Both username and password must be between 1 and 255 characters.<br /><br />http://www.torproject.us/docs/tor-manual.html.en</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />

				k+ Thank you zer0cool and Shannon you made it really clear for me.<br /><br />Well as a buyer I think setting a private bridge for me would be too much of an hassle as I don&#039;t have the technical skills for it. <br /><br />What would be the pro / cons of using for example a wireless hotspot? They wouldn&#039;t be able to trace you but what about the person who controls the network?<br /><br />I was going to ask for secure proxys who do not keep logs but I realized that is a stupid question to make on a forum like SR....

I can&#039;t (and won&#039;t) endorse a specific service, which is a bad idea, but look around for proxy services that support either SOCKS5 or HTTPS, as well as bitcoins.<br /><br />Then once you&#039;ve got a list of these, narrow them down to the ones that have the best reviews, and where you might actually believe their claims about no logging.&nbsp; Look for ones based outside of fascist countries. The more honest services tell you they keep logs for some fixed period of time, say 7 days, or 30 days, in order to comply with the law as well as debugging.&nbsp; I&#039;d be doubtful of any Western-country proxy service that claims to keep zero logs at all, but they do exist.<br /><br />Just look for some compromise.&nbsp; Say you are in the UK.&nbsp; Using a proxy in a foreign country, that you paid for with a credit card, that keeps logs for 30 days, is definitely better than directly accessing Tor from your house because the UK has increasingly shitty data retention requirements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Using bitcoins to pay for the proxy is even better.&nbsp; Using bitcoins for paying for a proxy that keeps no logs is even better still.&nbsp; Just make sure you configure your Tor client to properly build circuits through the proxy, and this will probably be more than enough security for most buyers.&nbsp; &nbsp;For now, anyway.<br /><br /><br />

				Just did a quick read of today&#039;s posts here and for the most part, I concur with everything that&#039;s been said. Good info ITT.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be accessing tor from open wifi, know that certain establishments do manage to block it somehow. I don&#039;t know if they use DPI or just ban the IPs of directory servers etc, but it is impossible to use &quot;vanilla&quot; tor in some of the bigger corporate chain places. This is where bridges will come in handy, and you don&#039;t need to worry about private bridges or anything like that. Just go to [https] bridges.torproject.org and copy down the ones running on port 443. Enter those into vidalia and you shouldn&#039;t have a problem connecting unless they use some crazy DPI, which probably won&#039;t be the case unless you somehow connected to their proprietary corporate WLAN instead of the public hotspot. lol<br /><br />This was already brought up, but please don&#039;t get yourself on camera or use any form of plastic payment anywhere near the area of your open wifi. If possible, drive there and sit in the far corner of the lot or wherever there&#039;s no CCTV coverage. Don&#039;t look around or act nervous, just sit there and do your thing while sipping on a coffee. Remember, you&#039;re just catching up on some work...<br /><br />High gain antennas are great for this, especially if you live in a city with plenty of hotspots. Combine this with bridge hoping and other forms of tor use concealment and you&#039;ve got some pretty strong-ass security for general SR use.

All you do is then block all incoming IP&#039;s other than your own and make sure you pay for it anonymously.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Re-read what I wrote.&nbsp; You lose the benefit of Entry Guards if you use your own private bridge... There is one less layer in the circuit to De-obfuscate.&nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, this puts you closer to the Rendevous Point and ultimately the hidden service your are accessing.<br /><br />I do not think running a private bridge is a good idea from a security standpoint until there is some form of entry guards added to it&#039;s connection into the larger tor network, otherwise you are just replicating the standard problems that caused the addition of Entry Guards to the Tor protocol in the first place.&nbsp; The real solution here is to update the Tor protocol to address these attacks.<br /><br />YMMV, if you can back up your assertion that it is more secure, then be my guest, but for the vast majority of users here, they will be much more secure using a persistent Tor connection with slowly rotating Entry Guards than they will be using a Private Tor Bridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ONLY way running your own private bridge would be safe, would be if the private bridge was 100% anonymous, untraceable, and was not under surveillance.<br /><br />Even a private bridge still has to deal with the problem of potentially compromised or malicious nodes, which is the fundamental problem on the Tor network, along with timing attacks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It can really be argued both ways, and smart people take both opinions. There are clear advantages to using a private bridge:<br /><br />It is far less likely to be in a given attackers list of known Tor bridges / nodes <br />It is far less likely to be under active surveillance than a random bridge or node, potentially making you much more secure from active timing attacks<br /><br />there are clear disadvantages:<br /><br />Most people don&#039;t use &#039;strict bridges&#039; or private bridges. After enough time, several less than global passive attackers will probably be able to determine that some entity (you) is strictly using a private bridge. This makes you stick out from the crowd and may be cause for further investigation, possibly. <br /><br />There is *no* crowding at the entry guard of a private bridge. <br /><br />there are even some disadvantages to using bridges in general, for one using a bridge gives your anonymity a hit in order to give your membership concealment a big boost. For two, if the bridge fails at actually providing membership concealment it is worse than not having membership concealment in the first place, because now you stick out as someone who is using Tor who feels some need for membership concealment. In this respect, if using bridges is a very good or very bad idea depends entirely on your attackers ability to defeat the membership concealment properties of bridges.<br /><br />It is actually a quite complex question and without having intelligence on the feds abilities it is not possible to come to a definitive conclusion. <br /><br />Also a source of confusion seems to be the fact that bridges and entry guards serve so many roles. Looking at them from a censorship resistance perspective, Vlad is correct to suggest that you should use as many bridge nodes as possible. This is far more in line with a chinese citizens threat model than with ours though. Looking at them from a membership concealment perspective, you should use as few bridges as possible, however using less than two bridges creates serious security issues and it is probably best to use three. Looking at them as entry guards, it is clearly better to use less. It is probably best to treat them like regular entry guards, selecting no more than three at a time. Bridges used in this way become entry guards and thus you are not losing the protection of entry guards by using them.

Don&#039;t follow any kind of rubric or plan as these are predictable, anticipated by your adversaries, and will help them track you down. Just make a nice big list of working bridges and choose them completely at random. The kind of people who need to worry about being traced through tor via poisoned nodes/bridges the second they connect are likely paying top-billed IT &quot;guerrilla security experts&quot; to take care of them and really shouldn&#039;t listen to us. lol<br /><br />For the average SR user buying small amounts of drugs from US to US, connecting to a fed node/bridge once or twice at random (the realistic odds of this happening today) is way, way less of a problem than running one&#039;s mouth and getting caught that way, or simply having a package seized. Even if the feds suspect you&#039;re using SR and stake out your internet connection looking for tor activity, they will have a much harder time meeting their goal if you use public bridges--the majority of which are presumed to be legit ATM--than if you connect to tor directly. Believe me, the security of your local machine is going to more important IT-wise than worrying about tor. We don&#039;t have much control over tor anyway, plus it&#039;s much easier for feds to attack us directly via CIPAV and the like right now rather than try and somehow &quot;break&quot; tor to any significant degree.<br /><br />BTW, enough of the fed hunting. Let&#039;s just presume everyone here that you are not doing business with (and even then) is LE. Communicate, but don&#039;t get all palsy-walsy with each other. Always keep that level of separation where you can share ideas and have fun, but not give away too much about who you are and how you think, type, etc. and not to where you take every bit of advice as gospel (remember tony76). NEVER, EVER trust one, single anonymous entity with your safety. That means no private SR tor bridges. No... just, no. Create your own private bridge but do not use someone else&#039;s. If that person is 100% legit today, that doesn&#039;t mean they can&#039;t become an informant tomorrow and basically screw everyone connecting to their bridge server. That&#039;s a far greater threat to SR than actual undercover federal agents, who are usually very good at what they do and very difficult to spot.

				/me thinks about selling a spyware infested &quot;secure USB!&quot; configuration and making pop ups come up on customers screen questioning why they were so stupid to trust a product they bought on SR<br /><br />fully open source, full tutorial on how it is configured step by step, or gtfo <br /><br />vlad you seem more and more sketchy to me with your assortment of plans to offer products that could be used to deanonymize people, 3G dongles from you, private tor bridges from you, USBs from you, tablets from you.....why suddenly the interest in selling such things?&nbsp; Nothing like this is good for people to buy here, especially bridges tablets or dongles. I really don&#039;t think you mean any harm, but it strikes me as strange to see your sudden plans to offer such things. Also<br /><br />To anyone selling preconfigured live OS: unless your preconfigured live OS or other software is open source and step by step details for configuring them are released for everyone to audit, then only idiots will buy it. There are already free security oriented distros out there made by professionals why the fuck would anyone buy one made by somebody with little experience and sold on an illegal forum for profit (profit here implying that it will not be open to public audit)? , leave configuring security oriented operating systems to professionals. If you don&#039;t know what mandatory access controls are, you have no place in selling pre-configured live operating systems. I have studied security for years and have years of linux and BSD experience and still do not consider myself properly qualified to offer a truly hardened OS (then again, I don&#039;t consider tails or liberte to be truly hardened OS distros either) . <br /><br />It is nice to see people with interest in security and wanting to offer products, but if you don&#039;t have extensive study of such things you will fuck up enormously without being aware of it . The only way around this is to gain experience or to have a lot of support from people with such experience who are willing to audit your products. If you don&#039;t follow an open source publicly audited model for making products available you will never be trusted by anyone with a brain. My suggestion is make it open source and free, document every single step and ask for donations from your users, that is the only way any system from you or anyone else will ever be considered trustworthy.

I have been transparent about my plans and since I won&#039;t even be handling the products in question I fail to see how I could tamper with them. As I said I&#039;m in the process of writing a guide in conjunction with another seller (who is based in the US) to show people how to access SR safely from their Android devices. I have asked OZ and two other more established members on the forum to edit the guide once the first draft is ready and you&#039;re welcome to read it yourself to verify it is simply a way to help people to secure their own device from being monitored through installing a Tor browser, enabling full device encryption and so on.<br /><br />As for selling USB devices and 3G dongles, I seem to remember saying that when I first started selling on SR I suggested this as the ones already available were far too expensive but as I stated above, there&#039;s too much of a risk that the setup will not be secure which is why I did not follow through on this&nbsp; - I&#039;m not exactly sure how someone could interfere with a 3G dongle in that way but of course you know best as always.<br /><br />You may not agree that my plan to sell secure Android Tablets for SR users this is a good idea - here&#039;s a newsflash for you, I don&#039;t give a damn. <br /><br />I already made it clear when you advocated murdering Police Officers that I don&#039;t want to do business with you. You are a pathetic, twisted individual and frankly I think you&#039;re giving us Brits a bad name on here. <br /><br />V.

The devices are compatible with 3G also and instructions to do this may be included with the guide but I&#039;m not sure if this would be as anonymous as using your home internet connection.<br /><br />The alternative would be to set up the devices ourselves but we do not want to do this as there&#039;d be no way for the end user to know that they hadn&#039;t been tampered with and it&#039;s also important to stress people take responsibility for their own security as far as possible.<br /><br />OZ is just one of the people I have been speaking to, to edit the guide and when the time comes as I already said the first step will be to reset the device to factory conditions as soon as it arrives. <br /><br />Anyone who doubts my motives in wanting to provide an affordable and easy way for people to access SR is welcome to read the guide and check that this indeed a much better way of doing things.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Naturally this is a point I want to address in the guide you just read about - it seems your options including removing all such applications besides the Tor browser itself, configuring them correctly or rooting the device to force it always to use the Orbot application to access the net. <br /><br />If you want to be part of the solution, believe me, you&#039;re more than welcome!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Clarke. &quot;Next---The Planets!&quot;, Report on Planet Three. 1972<br /><br />So we&#039;re on to stage two now, all well and good, getting up there! :-)<br /><br />To clarify, what I had in mind was using a device solely for accessing SR - I agree that having your GPG private keys on a device with connectivity to the internet is a risk but do you have much of a choice unless you want to ferry encrypted data back and forth on a USB stick between devices? Wouldn&#039;t you need an extra device to do this in any case? <br /><br />I already mentioned the advantages of a conventional cold boot attack not being possible as far as I can see? I mean plugging in a USB stick with bootable OS wouldn&#039;t work against the full device encryption now available on tablets surely? A tablet would also be far easier to conceal and destroy than a laptop or home computer in the case of a raid. <br /><br />I also think a tablet wouldn&#039;t give off the same kind of EM emissions as a regular monitor/keyboard which could be picked up by the kind of SIGINT spying. There&#039;s also the fact it&#039;s far less susceptible to malware given that there&#039;s appreciably more viruses out there for other Operating Systems (admittedly that&#039;s changing!).<br /><br />There&#039;s also surely the advantage of portability - more so even than a laptop, with all the necessary functionality. I originally conceived this as an idea for people to check the balance of their wallet if buying BTC in cash but have since been persuaded that using such devices with 3G/Public Wifi is potentially dangerous.<br /><br />I&#039;m also hoping to set the cost of these devices well below the price of acquiring another laptop or home computer.<br /><br />So to my count that&#039;s five advantages and one potential advantage i.e slightly higher resistance to malware due to smaller number of viruses that this would have over using a separate computer/laptop. <br /><br />Are we still at Stage two or can we move on to stage three yet? :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

If you read my posts you&#039;ll see I&#039;m passionately interested in protecting users&#039; privacy - I run a cash to BTC service for goodness&#039; sake! I admit I make a small profit out of it but it was always my plan to expand into new areas and one of those is providing an affordable and convenient solution for users to access SR safely. I often speak to new users who tell me about the difficulty they have had understanding some of the advice given and it beggars belief that some of the set ups I&#039;ve heard about on here would be better than a secured Android device - most people just download and install the Tor browser after all. Perhaps this is a discussion for another time but there&#039;s definitely a demand for this kind of service.<br /><br />As for exposing one&#039;s privacy, an Android Tablet properly configured can be every bit as secure as any other device, if not more so as I&#039;ve already mentioned above. It&#039;s true the people buying them might have to give out an address where they can receive it but that risk is surely lesser than having class A drugs delivered to their own home considering the product is legal?<br /><br />Apparently using Pay as you Go 3G isn&#039;t as secure as using your home internet connection to access SR - I&#039;m not exactly sure why but I made the offer to sell dongles in good faith but was told it wasn&#039;t a good idea. How many 3G dongles have you seen for sale on my vendor page since that time?<br /><br />I rest my case.<br /><br />V.

I have asked OZ and two other more established members on the forum to edit the guide once the first draft is ready and you&#039;re welcome to read it yourself to verify it is simply a way to help people to secure their own device from being monitored through installing a Tor browser, enabling full device encryption and so on.<br /><br />As for selling USB devices and 3G dongles, I seem to remember saying that when I first started selling on SR I suggested this as the ones already available were far too expensive but as I stated above, there&#039;s too much of a risk that the setup will not be secure which is why I did not follow through on this&nbsp; - I&#039;m not exactly sure how someone could interfere with a 3G dongle in that way but of course you know best as always.<br /><br />You may not agree that my plan to sell secure Android Tablets for SR users this is a good idea - here&#039;s a newsflash for you, I don&#039;t give a damn. <br /><br />I already made it clear when you advocated murdering Police Officers that I don&#039;t want to do business with you.

				You are going to have OZ audit it well that is a good move, OZ is probably a fucking fed and is certainly a troll who doesn&#039;t have the slightest idea what he is talking about. It would be stupid to buy a security product audited entirely by someone who thinks BSD is a type of Linux even if it wasn&#039;t created by someone whose sole security experience comes from reading a single Schneier book, let alone the fact that these products are being sold on an illegal forum by the same person who tried to get people to give him their IP addresses with the guises of offering a private bridge / 3G WiFi dongles. I don&#039;t give a damn if you don&#039;t give a damn what I think, I am just warning people that buying those services/products from you would be fucking retarded, it is the same type of shit that feds do.<br /><br />PS: Since we play argumentum ad hominmen, I couldn&#039;t give a fuck less about the opinion of someone who wants to murder people for looking at pictures and suck the dick of the cops who want to put us in prison for using drugs.
