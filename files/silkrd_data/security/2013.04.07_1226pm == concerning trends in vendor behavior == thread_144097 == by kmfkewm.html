				After starting to visit the shipping sub forum a bit more I have become aware of a worrying trend. This trend is vendors buying vendor specific products (tracking stamps, MBB and other shipping supplies) from other vendors. I think that this is extremely worrying from a security perspective. In the case of MBB it is worrying simply because the vendors ordering these supplies are getting them sent to boxes that can of course be put under surveillance. Even if they order the bags from throw away accounts, it wont matter, because only vendors are going to order those and they leak their geolocation anyway so it is simply a matter of matching up the geolocation to the vendors known to operate out of that area. If one of the big MBB vendors turns out to be a fed, or is later compromised, that could lead to the busts of all of the vendors who ordered from them, and it seems that a LOT of vendors are ordering these bags from a select few suppliers selling them on SR. This is extremely worrying to me. Even more worrying is the fact that apparently several vendors are buying tracking stickers from vendors on SR who specialize in selling them. This to me just seems so dumb that anyone could think this is a good idea. Now not only do these tracking sticker vendors get the box information of the vendors they are shipping them to, but they can trivially get the addresses of all customers sent anything with those tracking numbers! This means they can easily send a vendor a hundred tracking stickers, put the box they ship them to under surveillance, identify the vendor, wait for them to send out 100 packs, identify all 100 of the customers addresses, intercept some of the now very easy to locate shipments, find they have drugs in them and raid the vendor. That is just fucking horrible security and I am blown away that any vendors are stupid enough to be doing this! I don&#039;t want to point any fingers at anyone, if there is one thing I know it is that a lot of people trying to offer services are not well versed in security , but really to me this full situation just looks like an operation unfolding. They cannot get through our technical security measures so instead they try to get at vendors and customers by tricking vendors into ordering shit from them, in some cases ordering shit from them that allows them to enumerate their entire client bases addresses and locate their packages at will! Now is this certainly happening? No, but it sure as fuck could be, and that is extremely concerning.

				Funny I read this just now. A few hours ago I was having a conversation with someone about how stupid it seems to buy the dope baggies on here. That says nothing but &quot;I am getting ready to distribute&quot;. Also, I think it is a VERY dumb move to buy &quot;pre-loaded&quot; usb devices for &quot;security&quot;. Maybe it is just me, but these things seem like a 1 way ticket to prison/jail. I really do not want to offend any vendor who is legit in offering these things, but security wise, it seems absurd.

But from reading the shipping sub forum I can see that several vendors are apparently dumb enough to buy their shipping supplies here. Hm, vendors accessing SR with preconfigured devices they buy on SR, to get orders for drugs from customers (I can only assume over privnote), then putting the drugs in bags they bought off SR , packaging them up and slapping on a tracking sticker they bought off SR. What could possibly go wrong, other than absolute total compromise of everything related to that vendor?

				It is just far too easy to obtain these things legally and without using a currency that is constantly growing. I do hope vendors that have made this &quot;lapse of judgment&quot; corrects it very quickly. You are putting everyone at risk and most importantly, these are the sly tactics that will be used AND WORK to catch some. I feel like some people are far too wrapped up in making cash on here and moving product to think about what happens when caught. Your bank accounts are drained, your contacts are possibly screwed, you sit in a cell, and most importantly it is a victory for LE vs. SR. Hats off to all of those who go that extra mile!

				This is why I wish they would charge even MORE for vendors to join....... Too many really young small fries joining that haven&#039;t thought out their operations yet...... Takes almost a good YEAR to research and plan out an op for SR that will be safe to run for both the vendors and customers. We take this planning and CONSTANT changes to plans seriously. Please other vendors don&#039;t get into habits or routines for your operation. Stagnation is the death of an operation.

				thanks kmfkewm for being outspoken and bringing this to peoples attention, seems like it would be common sense to avoid such practices but sadly thats not in high supply on sr these days. this was one of the things that needed to be brought up to avoid future problems. hopefully more people will read this thread and improve where they can on their business practices.

The permeability issues can be easily googled for scholastic/scholarly journal papers if you are in the U.S.<br /><br />Google first for safe storage plastics for all your various acids. Look for safety gloves and acids... pertaining to safety. There is a lot of information about polyethylene, nitrile, latex, polypropylene, etc.... I gotta go for now, but that should get you started.

				we can take this thought experiment:<br /><br />a vendor on SR has invented a totally impenetrable bag solution, impermeathon. Unfortunately, the only way you can get impermeathon is by ordering it from them. Even if we all agree that impermeathon is impermeable , and dogs will not hit on customers packs if the drugs are in the impermeathon bags, it is even worse than using no sealing bag at all now because all the vendors are centralized in getting orders of impermeathon from a potentially rouge and certainly compromisable node. At the end of the day the argument has nothing to do with what materials are best, and everything to do with what vending practices are best. Given the choice between perfect packaging and overall vendor security, we would be wise to opt for overall vendor security. Thankfully there are ways you can get impermeathon without going through channels on SR, but just keep in mind that if the vendor is compromised it doesn&#039;t matter if they ship their drugs through a teleportation device that bypasses customs and postal system entirely.

				I was wondering about this myself privately for awhile. There are certain things you can buy here that might indicate you&#039;re&nbsp; a vendor, like those MBB bags, even if you use another account. <br /><br />you can get those bags elsewhere and cheaper too.

Because doing that is going to be way fucking easier than finding an established vendor and making him work with them.<br /><br />You can imagine not many people actually buy this stuff, it wont take the police long to put 2+2 together. And at least you have anonymity on here.<br /><br />I trust the vendor I&#039;ve bought them from.. He was the guy that introduced it all to us. Granted I don&#039;t use my own name or address when ordering.. any vendor that is stupid enough to do that deserves to be caught frankly. <br /><br />Might I add that the bags I get have no serial number or anything either.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s what I&#039;m worried about too!&nbsp; But dude, that person selling you the bags might be law enforcement themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp;And even if there is no serial number on the bag, they can still use the writing on the bag to get the manufacturers info.&nbsp; Lots of them include a batch # or some way to identify the bags.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they can narrow it down to the people in your area who had the bags sent to them. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Mine have no numbers are tracking codes on them - they are just simply a large sheet that I cut out and heat seal together to make pouches with.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel at risk at all, really.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What is more likely, that law enforcement will coerce all clearnet providers into supplying all customer information to them, or that law enforcement will set up shop on a massive international drug selling site and hope that vendors use their service? It doesn&#039;t matter if your bags have serial numbers on them or not, you give the vendor a shipping address that can be put under surveillance. LE would be very smart to start selling vending supplies on SR, it is a surefire way to identify vendors stupid enough to order vending supplies on SR.

I&#039;m not a vendor and don&#039;t go around asking vendor friends to copy/paste the roundtable stuff just for little old me or something, but I&#039;m quite certain I&#039;ve seen people explicitly state that MBBs are almost impossible to find, hence the reason they get them on SR.&nbsp; Is that really just nonsense?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Complete nonsense often known as laziness. This is pretty new to me but if vendors are doing this then I honestly would want to know as a buyer because a vendor that lazy and unsafe shouldnt really be in the community. Not to add that as mentioned earlier its actually easier to obtain than ordering from SR.<br /><br />
