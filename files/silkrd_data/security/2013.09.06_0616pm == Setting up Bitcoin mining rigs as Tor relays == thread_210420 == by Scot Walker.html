				I&#039;m just curious how this would work, and if it could be safely done without interrupting the miner? I have several BTC/LTC mining rigs, and just thought if this would work, it may be a way to help out the current Tor traffic problem. Since the rigs just sit there and mine, it&#039;d be a way to make another good use out of them.<br /><br />Thanks!

				What OS are those mining rigs using? Linux? Which distro?<br />I think there are configuration options which prevent it from using too much CPU time.

				I wonder about this too but is it also putting a big target on the map??&nbsp; if you are running a clean house and never surf dark web it would be good

				If you run a relay then the NSA will know you run a relay, and they may have a closer look at what you do on the internet. I don&#039;t think it means that you have to expect SWAT teams killing your dog though. <br /><br />Have a look at this thread too:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210197.0

				Tor eats tons of CPU, especially as a relay. Why would you handicap your mining rigs with it?

				hmm, I guess that&#039;s true. Depends on the coins you&#039;re mining. If you have a modern CPU with AES-NI, make sure to set<br /><br />HardwareAccel 1<br /><br />in your torrc for better performance, too.<br />

				All GPU mining, but it sounds as though it might not be the best idea anyway. Thanks for the responses!

				This thread got me thinking, could one theoretically construct a very small desktop tower, BTC mining-like system, put it on solar power hidden covertly near a public wi-fi hotspot and chilling as a standalone Tor relay? Would be really simple if pre-assembled to set them up on rooftops with a simple weather housing.. Could even do the same to private residences if you could figure out their wi-fi password.... Set to use a less than noticeable amount of bandwidth.. <br /><br />Would be fun to go backpacking in Asia somewhere and plant Tor relays hehe.. Ideally a more modernized location and a less rural one... Japan comes to mind.

				@bedtime666<br />You can run a Tor relay on a small Raspberry PI. You can probably build a solar powered one for less than 150$<br />Would probably be a good idea to limit its bandwidth usage, so the admin of the wifi doesn&#039;t get upset. Maybe make the Tor relay only run at night or so.<br />Port forwarding would be an issues though, as a port of the relay needs to be reachable from the internet.<br /><br />This webserver runs on a solar powered PI, it&#039;s been running for 219 days without reboot.<br />http://pi.qcontinuum.com/project.html
