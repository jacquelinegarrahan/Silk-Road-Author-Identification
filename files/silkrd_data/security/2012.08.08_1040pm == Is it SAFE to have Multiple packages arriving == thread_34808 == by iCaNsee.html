				You should be fine i have multiple packages arriving the same week a lot. I think my current orders are going to arrive on the same day.&nbsp; As long as your mailman/lady isn&#039;t suspicious you should be fine. It helps if you already receive a lot of packages to begin with. Try to relax, more than 95% of packages arrive-don&#039;t know exact statistic but its around this i believe- safely. We were all a little paranoid at first.

Then again I can&#039;t assure you that you won&#039;t be struck by lightning, or die in a car wreck. Statistically if you didn&#039;t ship it to some retarded name, used a good vendor you&#039;ll likely be fine. The numbers from Pine and from the other studies show around 97% of packages make it through. Really though its always SAFER to have only one package at a time. <br /><br />If you are really worried make sure your house is clean, and watch the video on Youtube &quot;Never Talk To The Police&quot;. Make sure you have 15-20k set aside to pay a good lawyer. If its your first your first offense you&#039;ll likely get a small fine and maybe a few months in jail in the absolute worst case.<br />
