				@gerstoner, did you set up a transparent proxy and firewall rules so that malicious scripts can&#039;t unmask you? If so, can you provide instructions?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to set up an Ubuntu-based flash drive OS where my browser passwords actually save and I don&#039;t have to jump through Tails&#039;s hoops to get stuff done, but would like it to also be secure.

				Well you don&#039;t have my option... I use IE and weatherbug from a DEA computer:)<br /><br />In all seriousness.... I use an encrypted drive that has TBB and USB version of PGP, and run from my normal windows computer.&nbsp; Casual user here, so my needs aren&#039;t that robust.<br /><br />For casual SR customer, I don&#039;t see a huge benefit of booting a whole OS from a liveUSB/CD.&nbsp; Just too much of a hassle... I like to surf while waiting the normal 5 min to login to SR.<br /><br />I did for a short while use VirtualBox and installed a separate instance of Win7.&nbsp; You can encrypt either the OS or even the virtual disks/files themselves to keep people out, while still feeling safe that TBB won&#039;t leave &quot;dirty&quot; stuff on your normal computer.&nbsp; Though I did some digging and found very little that TBB left behind.&nbsp; Though you do have to be careful to keep your traffic entirely in TOR... don&#039;t upload/download files etc&nbsp; Keep notes etc on your normal computer etc... <br /><br />Ultimately I found even an VM was a pain... so I just use USB... and imo the only think USB adds is that extra layer of protection if LE searches your house and takes your computer, they might miss the drive.&nbsp; Where as if they find encrypted files they could try and get you to give them the password.

				Some interesting comments here. I&#039;ve used VM before on Fedora, and it worked just fine, it can slow down the comp and needs a lot of RAM, but it&#039;s a good way to go. <br /><br />Another option that I was just thinking of - like for the extremely paranoid ones: running Liberte from usb on a laptop without HD. I haven&#039;t tried it myself but one hardcore technical guy that I know tells me this set up is possible.<br /><br />Peace,

				I don&#039;t think you gain too much from removing the HDD if running liberte...&nbsp; Just booting to the USB and running the OS I would guess is 99.9% secure... I highly doubt Liberte will create a &quot;Liberte for SR&quot; file depicting your SR orders etc on the installed HDD.<br /><br />Unless you are retarded and decide that Liberte&#039;s cool new feature is that big secondsary drive to store all your snapshots of you doing blow with a hooker and Bill Clinton while making a How to SR video using IE and weatherbug.

You have to try quite hard to screw yourself over with either, for1 thing you need the administrator password to mount the HDDs in both and in liberte there is no use of root after the 1st 2 minutes (assuming you remember to activate from the boot menu).<br /><br />I use a live tails CD but I think its more pertinent where you store your info (private keys, account information and so forth). Personally I keep both encrypted off site to help with the whole deniability issue.

				The most secure way to go on TOR is using whonix over a secure OS (not windows). Whonix prevents anyone from discovering your real IP even if you download PDFs and run java applets (it&#039;s still not recommended but whonix developpers haven&#039;t managed to get their real IPs discovered yet), only the spoof IP that whonix generates. It&#039;s not that hard to configure too. For added security, use whonix with physical isolation, using two computers.<br />I&#039;ve tried it and it&#039;s pretty cool but I did it over windows which wouldn&#039;t be secure anyways..<br />I just use TBB, since I&#039;m a casual user. TAILS is cool too but it makes my computer overheat.
