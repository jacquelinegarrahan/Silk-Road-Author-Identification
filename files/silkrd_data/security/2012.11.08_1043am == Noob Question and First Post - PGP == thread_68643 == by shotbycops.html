				Hi Guys,<br /><br />New around here. <br /><br />I was just wondering if you should be using a PGP code, when placing orders in the delivery Box?<br /><br />And if so, is it as simple as cut/paste the PGP code then input your details for deilvery? I assume, you probably need to install PGP APP/Software.<br /><br />Sorry, I&#039;m sure this has probably been covered, so a point in the right direction would be appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks,

				Ok, fantastic.<br /><br />I have already placed one order, and did not encrypt any info - when input my delivery details.<br /><br />Would this be a problem?? Or is that purely going to depend on the vendor?<br /><br />Thanks again,

				It is a security loophole that I would close for future orders what is one is done is done I would not lose sleep over it just correct it for future orders and since you overlooked this info I would recommend rereading some of the guides for buying as you wouldn&#039;t want to continue to leave loop holes. I know they seem overwhelming as some are very detailed but the more time on the Road the more they make sense

				Thanks for your help, it is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />I have a few tutorials on how to pgp i.e. send messages to users/vendors....<br /><br /><br />But I&#039;m still unclear, sorry to be so annoying, I&#039;m just wondering with the buying process..... when it prompts you to put in your address details, what do you do?? just cut and paste the vendors pgp ??<br /><br />Again sorry for being such a noob....

				1. Install the desired PGP software (GPG4USB, GPG4win, or the Mac or Linux version depending on what you use)<br />2. Import the vendor&#039;s PGP public key in your PGP software.<br />3. Write your delivery address in a notepad file (.txt ).<br />4 Encrypt the notepad file with the seller&#039;s public key, make sure to output it in ASCII format.<br />5. copy/paste the encrypted text from step 4 in the box for the address details.

				I can&#039;t blame them. All the online tutorials I found were overflowing with information I have no use for, and none of them just clearly stated &quot;you use someone&#039;s public key to encrypt a message that only that person with their private key can then decrypt -- and no, you&#039;re not supposed to be able to decrypt your own letter to them after it&#039;s been encrypted.&nbsp; Also, ascii armor it.&quot;<br /><br />Guess I should have checked the forums instead of relying on random internet searches...
