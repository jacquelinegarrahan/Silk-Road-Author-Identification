				Gosh, I&#039;m freaking out.&nbsp; I never knew how computer incompetent I was until I tried to figure out Liberte and TrueCrypt.<br />I have a Mac and I&#039;m having serious issues with trying to install and utilize both of these programs.<br />I tried to encrypt my whole USB drive with TrueCrypt, and it was a long and complicated process in which I got lost.<br />I also was very, very lost with Liberte, and I&#039;ve read instructions/tutorials on the forums as well as the sites where the programs are hosted.<br />Is there a way someone can totally dumb down what to do to encrypt my USB/hard drive?<br />I&#039;ve spent already 5+ hours and I am so lost.<br />PLEASE HELP.

What you could do is 1) delete anything related to TB on your Mac, 2) Run Disk Utility (comes with it) and secure erase free space only ... that would be better than nothing. To boot a linux distro on your mac you&#039;re going to need rEFIt or gnu grub and I recommend you stay away from that software. Just read the bug reports. You can end up with a toasted computer.
