				I&#039;ve read/heard that you shouldn&#039;t use tor to connect to tracking info, and that mtgox will block your account if you use tor to logon / make an account there.<br /><br />Simple question...isn&#039;t tor supposed to protect your identity, as in hide your actual IP address?<br /><br />How does someone determine you are in fact connecting to them via tor?

				because of the way TOR works, if you&#039;re not using a bridge you&#039;re pretty much using the public network of TOR and the neckbeards over at MT Gox know through the exit nodes (correct me if I&#039;m wrong someone) or basically the IP you&#039;re using is linked to TOR because it is public. If you really want to use MT Gox anonymously, you&#039;d first have to make a fake account with fake credentials and use a private VPN.

				Thanks Delta, I&#039;m not looking to solely use mtgox anon, but inquiring with the masses here about tor in general.&nbsp; To be honest, I was reasonably surprised that a site could tell you were using Tor.&nbsp; I always thought of it as generally like a proxy server.&nbsp; Which now that I say that, essentially it seems to be just that.&nbsp; Only the exit nodes are public so if you&#039;re connecting to a site from one of the known exit nodes then its assumed you are tor&#039;ing I assume?<br /><br />So a bridge...essentially is a &quot;more private&quot; exit node, correct?<br /><br />Any reason &quot;not&quot; to use a bridge?&nbsp; I noticed the tor docs suggest not using one unless you have to...I&#039;m assuming to &quot;save them&quot; for those that really do?

				You can do your BTC transactions using VPN or open wi-fi networks such as at a library...somewhere without cameras is preferrable.&nbsp; Really not necessary I guess in the long run but if you&#039;re paranoid enough and want to make it as tedious as possible to trace your activity if someone were interested enough to try...I&#039;d say do everything you can to obfuscate what you do.<br /><br />Also, DONT EVER check tracking # on TOR, I keep hearing that it red flags your package for inspection.
