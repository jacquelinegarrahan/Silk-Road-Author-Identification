				Was looking around and noticed, that virwox accepts desposits made with paysafecard. http://www.paysafecard.com/us/us-paysafecard/<br />It seems, that principle of that thing is very much like moneypak in US, but this is working in EU, which is where I reside.<br />At first I was glad as hell - anonymity n shit, but then I noticed, that Virwox wants 20% (fckn racketeers) from deposited amount, which is highly unreasonably, but still it is option. Then I started to wondering whether paysafecard qualifies as prepaid debit card? I cant find definite answer to that, as company providing these cards call them &quot;prepaid vouchers&quot;. Some online gambling sites call them prepaid cards. If paysafecard is recognised online as proper prepaid debit card, then it makes possible to use it as payment option at get-bitcoins. And they tax only 3% - amount I am more than happy to pay for anonymity.<br /><br />So, does anybody here have some experience or other insight in paysafecard?<br /><br />Edit: Yes I see, that there are some threads discussing paysafecard, but they mainly focus on using netteller, moneybookers -&gt; virvox. Havent seen discussion whether it is possible to use paysafecard with getbitcoins.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry for my broken english - it is not my native language.

				High,<br /><br />paysafecard is somelike a debit card, but you only get a code and with this code you release the value (like MP, i guess)<br />try to exchange them via some of the bitcoin forums or maybe here (I had perfect bussiness with DutchQualityBeans i.e. but beware of scammers, once you handed out the code, the money is gone ;)<br /><br />Grüßung<br />BockZu
