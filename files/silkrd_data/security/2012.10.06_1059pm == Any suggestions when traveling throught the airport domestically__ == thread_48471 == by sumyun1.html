				I plan on bringing with me only about 10 to 15 roxi pills through the airport and wanted to hear any suggestions from you guys out there? Whether to put it in checked bags, carry on? Love to hear anyone else experiences....

				I flew many times with bunch of pills and supplements.&nbsp; I just had them in my carry-on bag and had no problem.<br /><br />They never bothered to ask me what the pills were.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t think TSA cares unless they see massive amount of pills or powder.<br /><br />People fly all the time witht their meds, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be a big deal.

				so you think if i just threw the roxi&#039;s in my klonopin bottle (which is prescribed to me) they wouldn&#039;t think twice about it? or would i be better off trying to hide them in my suitcase somewhere. what do you think?

				Just throw it in a prescription bottle.&nbsp; You will be fine.&nbsp; If you try to hide it, it will look more suspicious.

				You can also put them into a pill organizer (Like one that has slots for 7 days etc) along with other things that are OTC like advil, claritin if you have it, or anything really.<br />I&#039;ve made trips back and forth with 100-200 valium and adderall each way. They really aren&#039;t going to question your medical needs.
