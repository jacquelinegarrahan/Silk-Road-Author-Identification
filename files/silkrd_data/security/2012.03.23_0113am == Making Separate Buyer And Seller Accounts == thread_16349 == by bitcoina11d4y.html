				It would be wise to make an account for buying and a separate account solely for selling correct?

				I kind of agree, but I&#039;m a bit torn.&nbsp; You know, you build up a bit of a rep, whatever&#039;s it&#039;s worth, on here and on main forums, and it&#039;s just easier to keep track of one person...especially if you are active over here, it helps vendors to know who you are.&nbsp; The safety, I guess, is in just being as protective as you can of your username in case LE is selling, or has access somehow to addresses and such...If you use another username as a buyer, it would be kind of tempting to tell the vendors who you are, especially if you&#039;ve been involved in a thread about them.&nbsp; Probably the best policy though, especially if you are just starting out, is to keep them separate...<br /><br />One thing about using the same name: I actually got *boycotted* by one H-vendor who I&#039;d accused of ripping people off over here, but he came thru for some guys with what they said was ass-kicking shit, and so I apologized profusely and he forgave me and let me place an order for several hundred bucks, and I lifted escrow to show what pals we were...and then he promptly *did* rip me off ha ha...not sure what that means, other than that I&quot;m stupid at times...he probably got a good laugh out of that one...the fucker! :)

				I&#039;m guessing LE stands for law enforcement. You say there&#039;s a possibility they could be selling? if anything wouldn&#039;t they be more likely to be buying off you? (catch you for distribution)&nbsp; .........which brings up a good point....how does a vendor mail something without having to put their home address on the package? Could you just get a P.O. box? But you can be tracked by that too can&#039;t you?

				Every item I have got so far had a return address from the vendor. Like you said the vendor can make it so he/she can&#039;t be tracked, but is that only if the vendor doesn&#039;t put a return address on the envelope/package? Which would mean if the package gets lost eventually it ends up at a dead end location and opened to try to figure out who the sender is. Or can the vendor just put any return address.....

				If you&#039;re afraid of an LEO showing up and busting you after delivery, I read a fairly smart way of dealing with it.<br />Anytime you receive a package, immediately write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on it in black marker after getting it into your home. Then wait a day. Two if you&#039;re super sketchy.<br /><br />if Officer Dick doesn&#039;t bust down your door, you&#039;re good to go. If he does, just say &quot;once I got the package inside, I realized I hadn&#039;t ordered anything from that return address and intended to return in to the post office.&quot;<br /><br />credit goes to whoever posted this a couple months ago. it&#039;s a damn good idea if you ask me. If I absolutely can&#039;t wait to open it, I&#039;ll write on it, then immediately leave the house carrying it so the writing is visible to onlookers, drive in the direction of the post office, and then go somewhere else, rip it open, do some lines/roll a fatty, and stash the rest however I usually do.

				Mostly, regardless of what else you do, if you *do* get the unwanted &#039;knock on the door,&#039; remember that if u keep quiet, they can&#039;t prove a thing...even if you open the fucker, and are blasting away in front of god and your neighborhood, who&#039;s to say you didn&#039;t just get an unexpected blast from a friend...&quot;fuck if I know, officer!&quot; should be written in large letters on your ceiling!<br /><br />Again: on separate buy/sell accnts: sooner or later this will seem like a good idea, for different reasons...might as well get it out of the way &#039;sooner,&#039; rather than after you&#039;ve already built up a good rep on your forums username.&nbsp; you can always let trusted vendors know it&#039;s &#039;you,&#039; if that seems necessary to avoid FE or other newb tortures...
