				Hey there, I&#039;m planning on making a relatively small order from Silk Road in the quite near future. I have money; but I just want to know the best way to go about it. As far as I&#039;ve read, there&#039;s no way for me to make a cash to bitcoin transfer (I&#039;m with Halifax), which means I pretty much means I have to tie personal information to the order. So, my plan, was to just set up a bank transfer to MtGox (no card; so would have to be), then send it through to my bitcoin wallet, then to SR. So, if anyone from the UK can help:<br /><br />1) Is that relatively safe? It&#039;s nothing I&#039;d imagine would get intercepted in the post, couldn&#039;t be picked up by sniffers or anything and would easily fit unnoticably in a standard envelope. The risk is coming in me tying personal information to it, up untill the point it hits my actual wallet from MtGox<br />2) If so, should I use my real name for the email linked to MtGox, or is that not something that would ever be cross checked?<br />2) If not, is there any alternatives (i.e. direct cash to bitcoin; short of sending some randomer money over the internet that I haven&#039;t found out about?<br /><br />Cheers guys. You no doubt get a lot of annoying questions like this, so if it&#039;s annoying to anyone, my bad!

				Try Intersango. You can put cash into a Metro bank if there is one near you. (London only)<br /><br />Otherwise transfer funds from your account.<br /><br />Bitcoins are NOT illegal.<br /><br />You may get attention if you bought thousands.<br /><br />You need to open an account<br /><br />https://intersango.com/

But a fair point.. So it wont make a difference to send a bank transfer to a MtGox under my actual name, aslong as I send it to my wallet before SR? Or should I still use a fake name? Ordering it to a friends anyway, so maybe I&#039;m just being paranoid.<br /><br />Aha, a second opinion from someone wouldn&#039;t go amiss to settle my paranoia totally, but thanks for your advice&nbsp; :)

				You can get bitcoins ananymously in the UK one of two ways.<br /><br />Mtgox - set up an account on mt gox under an assumed name. Make a cash deposit at a Barclays bank directly to Mt gox, takes up to 24 hour then your funds will be available in your mt gox account.<br /><br />Intersango no longer allows anonymous cash deposits.<br /><br />Finally you can buy bitcoins directly from vlad1m1r, you send him cash in the post and he sends you bitcoins anonymously. Vlad1m1r is pretty active on the forums and has listings on SR.

				I use mt gox...<br /><br />Used intersango a couple of times as it&#039;s quicker - but the exchange rates are outrageous most of the time.<br /><br />My suggestion is just do small deposits to gt gox and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp;
