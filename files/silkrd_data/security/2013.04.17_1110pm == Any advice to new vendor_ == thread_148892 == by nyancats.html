				Hey all,<br /><br />So I&#039;m a quite new USA MDMA vendor around here. I&#039;ve been an active buyer on SR for a couple of years now, so I&#039;m familiar with the basic do&#039;s and don&#039;ts of shipment, packaging, and stealth.<br /><br />As you can see, I already have some good feedback on SR and intend to continue (though recent Bitcoin crash robbed me of ALL my profit, and no, escrow hedging won&#039;t help when you order and sell in BTC).<br /><br />However, I couldn&#039;t find a good do&#039;s and don&#039;ts lists here on SR.<br /><br />Can anyone point me to a relevant topic - or just list what they know? Any good vending advice is appreciated. Just trying to stay stealthy and safe here.<br /><br />inb4 OMG FBI - NO I&#039;m not a cop gathering tips on how to bust vendors... this information has to be out there somewhere already. I just hate searching forums over my slow Tor connection. IDEALLY I&#039;d ask this question on Vendor forum, but it&#039;s closed to me until I reach certain transaction limit and account age.

				Stay reliable and be fair with your customers - that will go a long way. Also, you most likely won&#039;t blow up over night unless your prices are really cheap. It takes time but eventually if you do those two things you will build a nice business.

				Honestly, a lot of things will happen that are outside your control.&nbsp; most of the do&#039;s and don&#039;t have already been learned, or are things you will learn on the way.<br /><br />The most important thing for you to do is have open communication and to be as transparent as possible with your potential customers when issues do arise.&nbsp; OBVIOUSLY i mean you should be as transparent as possible while maintaining your own security.<br /><br />If you go back and read through JoR&#039;s thread they&#039;ve been riddled with issues, but they&#039;re always upfront and honest about stuff and they VERY quickly rose to the top 1%, and there they&#039;ve stayed. ;)
