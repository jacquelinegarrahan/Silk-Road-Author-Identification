				Can anyone help me getting bitcoins? Is there someone I can make a dwolla transfer to buy bitcoins? I&#039;ve make a few purchases off of SR through WU at first, but now I am finally trying to get bitcoins (what a pain in the ass it is). So I signed up for Dwolla, took about a week to verify my bank. Another week to deposit my funds. Now, just as I think I am ready to buy some Bitcoins from Mt. Gox, it says I need to verify my social/upload id, wait 30 days, and do some other crap. What the hell is this junk? Can someone please help me. I just want to buy something from SR. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.

				Use Get-bitcoin.com. Once the money is in your Dwolla account, you send it to get-bitcoin, then you should have your bitcoins within 24 hours.<br /><br />You already verified your bank account. The only annoying part now is getting money to your Dwolla account which takes a few days (unless you sign up for that Instant thing).

				Yeah I can vouch for the Dwolla to the get-bitcoins route. Worked well for me for my first time getting bitcoins. The only thing that sucked like he said is waiting for the money to get to your dwolla account. lol get-bitcoins was quick with great customer service/ communication. Their website makes you wonder if it&#039;s legitimate or not, but I trusted this community on here and it worked. If anyone knows of any other ways that are faster that doesn&#039;t require a cash deposit at a bank, I&#039;m all ears as I live in a rural rural area of the country and the closest bank that was going to take any of the bitcoin program deposits was an hour and half away. Dwolla let me set it up with my bank account online. I didn&#039;t choose the instant thing because they don&#039;t need to be snooping through my credit.

				Dwolla is a total PITA and is not an option since they require verification now. I deleted my account with them. Now I use Btinstant&gt;MtGox&gt;Bitcoinfog&gt;SR and it usually takes half a working day for my SR wallet to be credited. The only sketchy step is logging into MtGox w/o Tor but I feel that bitcoinfog makes up for that by tumbling the coins. I don&#039;t know if my IP blocker is helpful but I use it anyway. <br /><br />I&#039;m still learning but that&#039;s what has been working for me. I&#039;m going to try get-bitcoin and coinapult this week too.

				Well. It isn&#039;t Getbitcoin.com&#039;s fault... Here is what comes up when I try to transfer money to them:<br /><br />Before you send money to this merchant, let&#039;s get to know each other a little better.<br /><br />Due to the nature of the recipient&#039;s account, Dwolla and this merchant politely ask you that you meet and/or maintain the following requirements. We&#039;ll check them off as you complete them.<br />1. Get friendly, establish a 30 day transaction history This merchant account requires you to have at least one bank-funded deposit into your Dwolla account that is older than 30 days. Link your bank and make a deposit today!<br />2. Get verified, validate your information Verify your Social Security Number.<br />3. Get savvy, turn on the Hub Page Hub Pages are individualized and shareable URLs that allow you to collect money with Dwolla

				I logged into my Dwolla account today, and there is a new &quot;Terms of Service&quot; that you must agree to to use Dwolla. It now forbids buying virtual currencies (bitcoin). But, transferring money from a Dwolla account to a mt.gox account isn&#039;t actually buying bitcoins, because it&#039;s just transferring money. Thoughts? I&#039;m about to give up Dwolla, but I like that it&#039;s cheap and it works well for me.

				Yeah... the new verification and Terms of Service for Dwolla basically made me go elsewhere. Today, I successfully made a deposit via Bitinstant -&gt; Coinapult. Much, much faster than waiting for a couple days for your Dwolla deposit to clear. I made the deposit at my bank, went to get some groceries, and by the time I got back, I already had my Bitcoins.
