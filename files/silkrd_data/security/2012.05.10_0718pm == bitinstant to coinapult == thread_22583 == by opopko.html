				Honestly, your process is a little confusing to me. I&#039;m assuming that you want to buy BTC from bitinstant, and get them sent to your email via coinapult, correct? If thats the case, here is a quick step-by-step guide to that!<br /><br />1. Go to bitinstant.com and select Cash Bank Deposit, with the destination being &quot;bitcoin to email.&quot;<br />2. Fill out the destination account and notification email with the same email. I use a TORmail account and it works great. Fill out the amount to send.<br />3. After you fill out all of this information, you will be sent to TrustCash, where they ask you to select a local bank to deposit the money to. Simply drive over there with the cash and a printed out slip of the confirmation page (it contains the account number that you are sending the money to).<br />4. By the time you get home, you should get an email saying that you have received bitcoins through a cash deposit. Follow the link to coinapult, which will give you a page where you can send your coins. I recommend sending it through a few e-wallets (easy/instawallet are my favorites) before sending it to Silk Road, where it will sit until you buy some goodies!<br /><br />Sorry for the long explanation, hope it clears some things up!

				i just found out about that method 2 days ago, and i will be using it as long as i use bitcoins. <br /><br />do e wallets act as tumblers or do they show up on block chains too? <br /><br />i was gonna use bitcoin fog but if you can just send them through a couple wallets instead of handing over 1-3% and waiting 6-12 hours i would way rather do that.

Having your coins run through a couple of e-wallets can&#039;t hurt though, makes tracking them harder. Splitting the transactions in random amounts is advisable, too. <br /><br />Whether tumbling your coins is necessary when you do small purchases off SR remains disputed afaik. If you&#039;re moving a few k of coins a week it is definitely a must to tumble your coins or launder them by other means.

				I actually found out about going Bitinstant -&gt; Coinapult thanks to this thread, and I successfully completed a deposit yesterday. Made my deposit, went to the grocery store, and by the time I came back, I already received a notification in my Tormail account from Coinapult. Must have been only an hour or so before I&#039;d gotten my bitcoins. This is definitely my preferred choice of funding now. Quite simple, and the turnaround for bitcoins can&#039;t be beat!<br /><br />Used to go Dwolla -&gt; Mt. Gox, but it&#039;d take days for my deposits to clear for Dwolla. On top of that, Dwolla&#039;s begun ID verification AND specifically stated in their new Terms of Service that they don&#039;t want you to use them for &quot;virtual currency&quot;. Screw that!<br /><br />Now with Bitinstant-&gt;Coinapult, I can grab bitcoins, and run them through Bitcoinfog before Dwolla even clears my deposits.

				Hang in there SRE.&nbsp; Are you in an area with concentrated population or no?&nbsp; There may be no banks that participate if you are in a more rural area.&nbsp; I have had customers use coinapult via bitinstant and they are thrilled with it.&nbsp; As far as the people who get stuck- there are many I agree.&nbsp; I was stuck for a while too with pgp and with some bitcoin problems.&nbsp; Some took a little looking, reading, and learning to straighten out while others took time for the bitcoin world to get their operations in order.&nbsp; Not all bitcoin businesses are agressively making it easier for beginners but more are trying all the time.<br /><br />I still like the easiest way to get bitcoins (it seems).&nbsp; This is to just offer something for sale like an electronic gift card from Amazon or Newegg.&nbsp; You have the code for the card in your email, and can sell it for bitcoins with little hassle.&nbsp; Choose a trusted member over there on bitcointalk.org as escrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are female it is even easier because geeks have a lot of bitcoins and most of them have trouble getting laid.&nbsp; Yet another way that beautiful women will take our money.&nbsp; And unfortuanately, yet another way that ugly women will take our money.<br /><br />Most of all don&#039;t despair.&nbsp; Keep communicating on the forum here and on bitcointalk.org and people will help you.&nbsp; I understand the frustrations of being a n00b because it was very recent for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish you lots of luck in getting those coins brother!<br /><br />-flax

It is very important you deposit exactly how much it says on the slip.<br /><br />3. When you get home from the bank, check your tormail and you will probably already have the email from coinapult. If not, just wait a few minutes, they fill orders by the hour. Simply click the link in the email you received and you will be taken to a page that shows however many coins you bought, with a box to type in a bitcoin wallet address to send them to. It&#039;s up to you how far you want to go with security, but you can simply send them directly to silkroad from there if you choose. <br /><br />4. Don&#039;t panic when the coins don&#039;t show up, it takes a little while. There will be a link on the same page to blockchain.info where you can track the progress of the coins being sent. Once it reaches 6 &quot;confirmations&quot;, your coins will arrive in your wallet. The process usually takes about an hour or less.<br /><br /><br />Sounds like a lot but it&#039;s really not. Once you are out of the bank it&#039;s really just waiting.<br />

				I use cash deposit to email (coinapult)<br /><br />I make the order on bitinstant<br />go to 711 (cause its closest) to the kiosk in the back of the store<br />Complete my transaction and by the time I get home, I have my email saying I received my coin :-) <br /><br />I run it through fog before I send it to sir just to be sure ;-) <br /><br />But it works very well

				Thank you very much blackened646 - but i&#039;m still a little confused&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Does bitinstant automatically use coinapult? Is that how it&#039;s able to send coins to an ewallet of your choosing?<br /><br />Also, what are your recommendations on security? Do you need to use bitcoinfog or a similiar service or is that overkill? And what about PGP and Tor Bridges - essentially how much security do I need to maintain complete anonymity?<br /><br />(Also what&#039;s the best ewallet to use in your experience?)<br /><br />Sorry for the metric assload of questions&nbsp; ;D

				No worries. When you go to bitinstant there are two drop-down menus, one to pick how you are going to deposit money (Bank, CVS, etc.), and another to pick how you want to receive your coins (Mt. Gox, Bitcoin to email etc.). <br /><br />Pick the bitcoin to email option. Bitinstant and Coinapult have a partnership, so when you pick this option Bitinstant is taking the money you deposit into their account, and sending you bitcoins through coinapult in exchange for it. <br /><br />So yes, bitinstant automatically uses Coinapult when you choose the bitcoin to email option, you do not at any time have to go to coinapult.com yourself. Just bring the printout and money to the bank, and when you get home you will have an email from coinapult with a link to a page for retrieving your coins. <br /><br />As for security, I don&#039;t want to tell you not to use bitcoinfog because the truth is nobody really knows if it&#039;s necessary. Personally I hate paying extra fees and for my purposes I think silkroads built in tumbler is enough. I&#039;ve never used bitcoinfog but some people would lose sleep if they didn&#039;t. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about Tor bridges but I can tell you PGP is an absolute necessity. Posting your address on here unencrypted would be a terrible mistake. PGP is very simple and takes less than an hour to learn, so there is really no excuse not to. If you need help just send me a PM after you have your coins ready and I&#039;ll walk you through the process.

				Thanks a ton man!<br /><br />In that case (just a last check) am I ready to go?<br /><br />I&#039;ve booted from a USB stick using liberte (should I delete Tor on my other OS / install it on liberte?), I&#039;ve got a Tormail account and I&#039;m assuming its just an easy dl/install of GPG once I need it (read: have coins.)<br /><br />Do things I dl / install on this liberte OS stay solely on the USB stick?<br /><br />Thanks again

				Yes, liberte on a usb stick is a great method to use. Nothing you download on it will leave any trace. <br /><br />Liberte actually comes with a PGP program, I believe you&#039;ll find it under system tools or something like that, just look around the menu. <br /><br />You seem ready to go as far as I can tell
