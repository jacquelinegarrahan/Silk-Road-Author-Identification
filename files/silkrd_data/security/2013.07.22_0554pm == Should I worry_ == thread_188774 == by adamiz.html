				Hello my dear community,<br /><br />I have a situation that I think about.<br /><br />I ordered almost 2 weeks ago some sample of weed from a vendor from Netherlands. Most letters from EU show up quickly. This hasn&#039;t show up yet, so I am assuming that it has been seized. <br />I don&#039;t care about the substance or my money, but I care about my safety. I want to order some things from SR this week and the question is:<br /><br />Should I be worried from the fact that IF this letter got stuck then someone is after me, or they will check every letter that goes to my address?<br />Or am I just getting paranoid with it?<br /><br />Your answers would be more than appreciated,<br /><br />Adamiz

				Assuming you have no record that would raise flags, other than this one incident, id say you shouldn&#039;t worry, however a good rule is to ship to a different address and/or only use domestic vendors to attract less attention. <br /><br />A personal amount of weed wouldn&#039;t make LE knock your door down or CD you, but a little worrying could keep you on your toes.<br />Better safe than sorry.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				just chill and relax. It could be a little late and that happens. If you never receive anything then don&#039;t worry still. It&#039;s only&nbsp; a small amount. But really if it makes you that paranoid then you shouldn&#039;t be here engaging in illegal activities. ; )

				Yeah, maybe because its a sample the vendor was a little slower than usual at getting the shipment out, which could of caused the lag.

				Also something to consider - your pack may have gotten lost due to a number of reasons other than it being confiscated.&nbsp; sounds convenient, but it happens.<br /><br />In addition, (depending on your country) if a package is seized then you receive a love letter or some sort of notification that your package is being held.&nbsp; So, without a love letter, Id assume that its like some other issue that has caused your package to not yet arrive
