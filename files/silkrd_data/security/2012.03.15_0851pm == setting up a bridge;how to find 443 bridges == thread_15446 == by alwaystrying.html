				so im trying to set up a bridge. <br /><br />for the record, all i did was click on the find bridges section..i keep taking away the one thats 443 and trying to find a new one for me. But it keeps coming up otherwise. I read somewhere they should be 443. Any idea how to find my final one? or if its even necessary to have them all 443.<br /><br />edit: So now ive gone on bridges.torproject.org and 3 bridges came up. I copied the one ending in 443 and 2 of the ones that popped up when i looked to find the bridge through my tor bundle. So now they are all 443. Am i really any more secure than before? why is this?<br /><br />any other little tweaks someone whos not that tech savvy could make to improve security?<br /><br />thanks in advance guys! <br /><br />

The main reason one would be interested in this is if they&#039;re a vendor though, I&#039;m not gonna lie, if you just get packs and don&#039;t send them you haven&#039;t really done much unless you utilize a fake ID PO box or something.

				You can always try changing your tor circuits, i.e. click &quot;New Identity&quot;, then refresh the bridge URL to get more. Yes, the 443 bridges are better than the ones running off port 9001 or 33333. It doesn&#039;t hurt to use bridges, and can actually make your connection to SR faster. Beyond that, you can always just use open wifi (or crack some WEP keys) and then tor. Just don&#039;t park/sit next to any cameras.

				great! thanks guys!<br /><br />hey, but im not making it harder for vendors to connect am i?<br /><br />i mean, my anonymity is great and all. But i have a tight enough set up as it is, dont get products sent directly to me etc. so i doubt ill ever be under investigation. although i do sometimes make substantial orders. still, if this takes bandwith from the guys that really need it, i could go back. what do you guys think?<br /><br />thanks for the help though people. its appreciated.
