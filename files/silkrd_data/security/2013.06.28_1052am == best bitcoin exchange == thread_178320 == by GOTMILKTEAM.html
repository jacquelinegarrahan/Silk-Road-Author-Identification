				Any of the exchanges that are worth anything to us (The ones that allow you to get cash quick) are all registered money transmitters. So they go by the regulations that banks do. None of them are safe. It would be better to use a Silk Road money service to cash out or some other anonymous method.

				you might also try btc-e.com .. however..<br />funding an account with euros or dollars.. is quite expensive.<br /><br />But.. it&#039;s all anonymous.<br /><br />i&#039;m expecting btc-e (and the other exchanges listed below) <br />to grow massively in the next 3 to 6 months as people flee from MtGox.<br /><br />Other (small) exchanges you could try include:<br />Vircurex<br />Cryptsy<br />Bter<br />Cryptonit<br /><br /><br /><br />

				you can use this referral link to sign up for a Vircurex account.<br />(this means, if you join, i get some kind of credit for referring a new member,<br />however, i have no idea what i will get... probably some tiny slice of a bitcoin)<br /><br />https://vircurex.com/welcome/index?referral_id=114-30948 <br /><br />it&#039;s an anonymous exchange.. it&#039;s online.. and they do about 12 <br />alternative bitcoin-spinoff currencies.. including litecoin...namecoin.. etc.<br /><br />I have an account there.. but only because i&#039;ve noticed that sometimes<br />bitcoins are cheaper there than they are at the bigger exchanges, like MtGox.<br /><br />That&#039;s gotta be worth a karma point :-)<br /><br /><br />

				Just go to the Money Section, Digital Currency, and find someone with no ratings that will do a MP fast and free and at current rates. Nothing could go wrong!<br /><br />If you live in a populated area, localbitcoins. Sometimes you&#039;ll find a reputable vendor here that cashes out at little to no fee, from time to time. Make sure whoever has a reputation, and if it seems at all too good to be true it is a scam. Don&#039;t pay 15%, even 10% is high. Someone reputable and fast at 5% you&#039;ll get good service. <br /><br />stay vigilant

				I have put through over 3,000 in localbitcoins.&nbsp; Most of the time it is a cash deposit to a bank account or western union.&nbsp; I dont meet face to face with anybody on localbitcoins.&nbsp; Go to a user that has more that 3 trades and 100% feedback it is a great service, I recommend the users bitabond, bauhaus, and schrodingerscat.&nbsp; All of them are quick and simple trades. usually within an hour or so.

				Thanks for all the responses interesting conversation. What we are looking for is a similar system like GOX where you can make large swift bank transfers of funds in multiple currency options and is liquid. <br /><br />MT gox asides form the fact they dont have USD, may not have any other currency they state transfers can take 14 days. Thats unheard of and frankly never was an issue for GOX a few months back. <br /><br /><br />

				I am new to the road and after about 2 weeks of researching, I went with Blue Sky Traders. Their rate is fairly low (It fluctuates but I paid about 4%) and it is 100% anonymous. You give cash to a bank teller in a Bank of America and youll have your coins in a couple hours. You will NOT be asked for ANY personal information or identification by the bank teller.

				You guy&#039;s are doing it wrong.<br /><br />Set up fake online business, register with Bitpay.<br /><br />Launder drug money to legal, taxable income you can freely enjoy without worrying about cops.<br /><br />It&#039;s what I did for about a year. Won&#039;t tell how I did this, don&#039;t want to ruin the game for others but it&#039;s pretty easy. Another method is simply become your own exchanger. UK needs coins right? Sell to them. Figure out how to do this. (hint, get a payment gateway)<br /><br />Also remember bitcoins you can split up to a dozen different cash mail order guys or people on bitcoin-otc
