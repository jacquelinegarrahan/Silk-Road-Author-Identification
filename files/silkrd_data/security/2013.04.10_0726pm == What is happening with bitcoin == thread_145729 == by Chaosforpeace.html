				Steady hands my friend, lots of panic selling going on but that will subside. We will either see a sustainable price for BTC or there is going to be another very large pump by some big whale money. <br /><br />If it was money you could afford to lose, hang on to it. This would also be a great buy opportunity (High risk vs high reward)<br /><br />Just don&#039;t emotionally react<br />

				I only believe that MtGox is being attacked by a DDOS (distributed denial of service) a botnet attack from an army of computers. No doubt that this is planned attack, and probably the people who lose money will have little recourse, because BTC hasn&#039;t caught up with the scandals and technical exploits that are illegal in stock manipulation. <br />If you can buy in at some of the low levels, like $110-$120 I&#039;d do it. But the services like MtGox and BitFloor (sob&#039;s don&#039;t even return a email before today about delays) are too busy probably making money by this known manipulation. People see the price falling, so they start to sell, it got started by some large trades and then they do the DDOS and the market goes wild. Big guys probably already got in at the lowest prices and the price will rise later today (or it won&#039;t, no body knows except the manipulators)

It doesn&#039;t matter if 1BTC = $200 or if 1BTC = .50<br />Its not the denomination of BTC that makes it priceless, its the fundamentals ( crypto-currency ) that make the difference.<br />Plan out your purchases and then convert your currency to BTC a few days or even hours before you purchase your goods.<br />This will take all the guess work out of where the prices of BTC are going. In truth it really doesn&#039;t matter where it goes, just as long as it doesn&#039;t go away.<br /><br />BTC is only a link in the chain people.

Lets say you ordered something last thursday for 1BTC (about $130 then), by the time you got it and finalized that BTC was worth well over $200. I&#039;m talking unhedged orders which I notice a lot are these days.

				I bought in at over 100. (Also ~$50 / $90)<br /><br />Definitely hang on guys! You really think that after all this, BTC is just going to fizzle out and die? Its potential (both good and bad) are only now being realized.<br /><br />Dare I say it, but I&#039;d almost suggest buying more when it&#039;s super low. Worst case scenario, the price stays there. You then have a stable stock of coins that you can spend without any volatility. Best case scenario, they appreciate a bit from all the other people buying at the &quot;floor&quot;.

				The price drop is amazing, I&#039;m sure glad I bought as the price of a btc reached the giddy heights of 145 UK pounds, its now dropped to 42 UK pounds. <br /><br />As for why the price dropped, I&#039;m guessing it has to do with circulation of bitcoins. So far the mining of the coins has been mainly European and USA but surely the Chinese are into this also, in fact, given the fact owning some coins is like a gamble right now, I&#039;d not be surprised if the Chinese went all for bitcoins! <br /><br />My advice echoes others. Don&#039;t panic sell, I predict that the price of bitcoins will go even higher than 145 UK pounds and see no reason why they cannot rise way above 200. <br /><br />As for them going super low again, that would mean coins are easy to mine but its a fact that they get more difficult to mine as time goes on which will generally lead to the price going up, not down. Even if technology made it easy to mine the coins, the difficult of creating the coins would always be on a par with that.<br /><br />And as a buyer of products, right now my coin is obviously buying less. I think we have seen a glut of panic buying today, people watching the btc charts and seeing losses each time they reload the page, will have just bought whatever they usually buy. Be interesting to see how much coin passed through SR today, but obviously, that is private information.<br /><br />I have to make a purchase for someone who sadly bought at just under 100 UK pounds a coin and is now looking at getting half of what they forked out for. I&#039;m leaving my coin and am sure that we will see the btc level out again. <br /><br />For vendors, its a case of most having done pretty well over the past few weeks. I&#039;d have cashed half in and kept half. <br /><br />Anyway, best buy before we see tears!<br /><br />And, bitcoin is actually going up. Its risen almost 1% since I started this.<br /><br />Might wait till tomorrow to grab that listing.

				The price dropped because of panic caused by the MtGox lag. Ironically, bitcoin crashed because too many people want bitcoins and the infrastructure can&#039;t handle them. There are multiple lines of evidence to support this. Account creation at MtGox is up 10 fold over last month. You think those people are going away? Most of them haven&#039;t had a chance to buy, because it takes a week to transfer money to MtGox. <br /><br />We saw the same thing today. As trading began in the United States, the lag went to 3, 5, then 7 minutes and the price dropped from $170 to $120, and then they suspended trading. IF they finally have their shit together when they reopen in a few hours, I think after an initial bout of craziness, perhaps another crash, the price will finally start rising again.<br /><br />There&#039;s 10 times as much interest in bitcoin now as there was when it first climbed from $10 to $100.

				The media keeps talking about Bitcoin...so the more people who jump on and buy, prices will sky rocket again, and yeah they will maybe triple in price..<br /><br />But i&#039;d say in a few hours when the japanese re-open Mt.Gox, things will pick up again.<br /><br /><br />Who believes BTC&#039;s will rise to $500 towards the end of this year? And will LTC&#039;s once listed on Mt.Gox follow them?<br /><br />Will be interesting to see what happens...

				If people stop investing in BC and the sellers on the road stop selling for a while (like some already have) then the price will drop like a rock.<br /><br />This DDOS attack on MtGox is designed to destroy confidence,people will either hang on to what bitcoin they have or sell.<br /><br />If this market can be manipulated so easily by big money u either want to be in with the manipulators or not in the market at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey Chaos, Sleep well last night? <br /><br />Check out this site, it might save you some $$$ WARNING: [clearnet] TheBubble.com. &quot;The vertical jump in prices was&nbsp; indicative of a &quot;mania phase,&quot; and predicted Bitcoin prices will eventually retreat to pre-mania levels of less than $15 apiece.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Given that the Bitcoin market is relatively small (about $2.5 billion), it won&#039;t take much for a bubble to pop.&quot;<br /><br />If you have followed&nbsp; my posts, I predicted 3 days ago that this would happen.<br /><br />You may PM me for private instruction if you wish.

				I extracted this from THE BUZZ, Bitcoins are a bubble. very interesting.........<br /><br /><br />First there was Tulip Mania. Then there was the dotcom craze. And let&#039;s not forget the run-up in housing prices. The newest bubble on the block is in Bitcoins, a 4-year-old virtual currency that has already increased ten-fold this year. And like all other bubbles, this probably won&#039;t end well for any investors who jump in way too late.<br /><br />Prices have nearly doubled during the past two weeks, and show no sign of slowing anytime soon.<br /><br />&quot;It is rare that we get to see a bubble-like phenomenon trade tick for tick in real time,&quot; said Wall Street veteran Art Cashin in a recent note to clients. &quot;But all that may be changing -- before our very eyes -- quite literally.&quot;<br /><br />Related: Bitcoin ATMs coming soon<br /><br />According to Jesse Colombo, an independent financial analyst and investor who keeps close tabs on bubbles at TheBubbleBubble.com, the Bitcoin bubble is currently in a mania phase.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re beyond the point where Bitcoins are only talked about among the early adopters, like tech geeks,&quot;&nbsp; said Colombo, who warned in early 2004 that the housing bubble and banking bubble would trigger a financial collapse. &quot;Bitcoins are getting a lot more media attention and we&#039;re seeing a lot of enthusiasm, greed and delusion.&quot;<br /><br />The buying frenzy has pushed the value of total Bitcoins to more than $1.4 billion, up from less than $150 million at the beginning of the year. The currency really gained attention, and traction, in the wake of a mini-bank run in Cyprus&nbsp; that raised concerns about the health of government-backed paper currencies like the euro and dollar.<br /><br />Related: Major Bitcoin exchanges hit with cyberattacks<br /><br />But Colombo says that&#039;s not enough to justify the parabolic rise in Bitcoin prices.<br /><br />&quot;I could understand a long-term uptrend based on worries about paper money,&quot; he said. &quot;But there&#039;s no real catalyst for the market to go up as vertically as it has.&quot;<br /><br />If the Cyprus crisis was the true spark, Colombo said he would expect gold and silver prices to rise in tandem, but that hasn&#039;t been the case. Gold prices have actually retreated this week, falling to a ten-month low.<br /><br />While Colombo doesn&#039;t believe the Bitcoin is doomed to fail, he expects prices to retreat back to pre-mania levels --&nbsp; less than $15 apiece.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to predict when investors will realize they&#039;re paying too much for Bitcoins, but it won&#039;t take much for prices to drop quickly. Given that the Bitcoin market is small, all it could take is just one large sale to give investors a reality check, said Colombo.

				As long as my paycheck doesn&#039;t come in btc, I&#039;m leaving the big investments for the other daredevils.<br /><br />Last week, on the bitcointalk forum I&#039;ve seen alot of selfcongratulating on being the new wealthy citizens of the New World, the richmen of a New Era and how we&#039;re all part of the most important thing in history since the lightbulb and more funny stuff. Those guys should get amped up and post on our forum in the amp/meth thread.<br /><br />I wanted to check how they&#039;re doing today but weird enough, there was no trace of those posts lmao.<br /><br />

				Jesus christ.. there not robbing anyone dude.. pretend YOU ran than business now, and bitcoins were going up and down DRASTICALLY in hours... your business would get fucked up as well...<br /><br />if u did a transfer and it didnt get through, dont sit and do nothing... hit up their live help, email them, go to bitcointalk and create a account, takes 5 seconds, and create a forum and hit up there rep he WILL answer you within the day and most likely fix your problem, im sure youve lost a fair amount of money....<br /><br />Even i did through bitcopia, it took about 4 hours and i went from 950$ to 750$ but thats the game u play when u wana buy in uncertain times..<br /><br />hopet his helps

				Read this&nbsp; ;) from wired about E Gold that started before bitcoin, it&#039;s only the fisrt bit you will have to check out the link for the whole story ... it&#039;s quite long<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MELBOURNE, Florida — In a sparsely decorated office suite two floors above a neighborhood of strip malls and car dealerships, former oncologist Douglas Jackson is struggling to resuscitate a dying dream.<br /><br />Jackson, 51, is the maverick founder of E-Gold, the first-of-its-kind digital currency that was once used by millions of people in more than a hundred countries. Today the currency is barely alive.<br /><br />Stacks of cardboard evidence boxes in the office, marked “U.S. Secret Service,” help explain why, as does the pager-sized black box strapped to Jackson’s ankle: a tracking device that tells his probation officer whenever he leaves or enters his home.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />“It’s supposed to be jail,” he says. “Only it’s self-administered.”<br /><br />Jackson, whose six-month house arrest ends this month, recently met with Wired.com for his first in-depth interview since pleading guilty last year to money laundering-related crimes, and to operating an unlicensed money transmitting service. His tale is one of countless upstarts and entrepreneurs who approached the internet with big dreams, only to be chastened by sobering realities. But his rise and fall also offers a unique glimpse at the web’s frontier halcyon days, and the wilderness landscape that still covers much of the unregulated and un-policed web, where fraud artists prospect for riches alongside pioneers, and sometimes stake, and win, a claim on their territory.<br /><br />Despite the shackle, Jackson’s conviction isn’t black and white. In a twist still unacknowledged by prosecutors, Jackson turned E-Gold for a time into one of law enforcement’s most productive honey pots, providing information that helped lead to the arrest and conviction of some of the web’s most wanted credit card thieves and hackers. He’s now working with regulatory agencies to try to bring back E-Gold, steps he says he would have taken voluntarily years ago if authorities had given him a chance.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/e-gold/all/
