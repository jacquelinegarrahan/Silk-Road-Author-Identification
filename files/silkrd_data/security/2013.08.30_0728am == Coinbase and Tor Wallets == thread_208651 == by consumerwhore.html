				I recently for the first time tried Coinbase. I got my BTC. But then I tried to directly move the BTC to my SR account. Coinbase wouldn&#039;t let me. I saw somewhere it&#039;s possible to tell if a wallet is tor based but I saw it in passing so I didn&#039;t look into it. Do you think they saw it was a tor wallet and blocked my transfer?<br />inb4 you should use a tumbler<br />I am aware of this I was in a hurry and strapped for cash and couldn&#039;t afford the 10% extra for bitfog.

				I did the same thing today, first time from Coinbase.&nbsp; The transfer happened immediately, which was eerie.&nbsp; It suggests Silk Road didn&#039;t tumble the coin.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Before sending it, I clicked to get a fresh depositing address.&nbsp; Not sure what else can be done but did you do that?

				I would strongly advise against sending your BTC straight from Coinbase to SR. <br /><br />To use Coinbase, you are pretty much giving them a lot of identifying information (bank acct, phone number). They pretty much know exactly who you are. Some recent event suggest that authorities can tell a bitcoin adress belongs to SR. <br /><br />In other words, if you transfer directly to SR from Coinbase (or other exchanges with verification standards), you are leaving a very visible trail.

				Safest course imo would be to transfer your coins from your coin supplier to another wallet that allows for &quot;anonymous&quot; transferring. Then transfer the coins anonymously to your SR wallet.

				This is what I do. I get my Bitcoin(usually virwox), then transfer it to a wallet on Blockchain.info. Then from blockchain I transfer to my SR wallet.

				Transfering to a blockchain.info wallet before SR is still highly traceable. I would recommend using Bitcoin Fog before sending your coins to SR if you bought your coins in a way which could identify you (such as coinbase)<br /><br />fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion

				I did create a new address before trying the transfer as I like to do that before any transfer to SR.<br />Your&#039;s went through? See I was asking because mine would not. It would just disappear entirely like I didn&#039;t even click anything.<br />Luckily I didn&#039;t lose them and was then able to transfer them to blockchain.info and then to SR. Next time I am definitely taking the time and money to run it through a tumbler. I guess they were just blocking it cause they could tell it was SR, I dunno. I just hope they don&#039;t keep that attached to my record or some bullshit.<br />Also, I thought the delay in the transfer to SR had to do with the BTC network confirming the transaction, not tumbling the coins. You&#039;d think SR would have enough accounts to just tumble the coins indefinitely and clean them for us.

				I&#039;ve used coinbase and it has worked every time for me going to SR. needless to say, now that I know more I&#039;m going to create an account on bitcoinfog.

				I think it&#039;s highly unlikely that Coinbase has a way to identify SR addresses. Think about it for a second. If that kind of information was available or there was a sure fire way to get the information you think SR would be around still? Or vendors trying to catch out. No ppl would be getting booked left and right. If you feel paranoid about using Coinbase then don&#039;t. There&#039;s other options like localbitcoins which I&#039;ve used and received my coins in 5 mins and totally anon.

				I&#039;m sorry, I wasn&#039;t clear. I know they can&#039;t tell if the address comes from SR, but that being said, they specifically refused that transaction but let the transaction to blockchain no problem. I was wondering if they are blocking transactions to totally anonymous addresses since there must be some way to tell how the address originated. I don&#039;t know enough of the backend to know. All I know is Coinbase is too convienient to give up and if you run it through a fogger, it would be rediculous to try and trace that. So from now on it&#039;s Coinbase-&gt;BlockChain-&gt;BitcoinFog-&gt;SR. For some reason I had thought BitcoinFog took 10%. Way off. Only 3% max. Much more reasonable.
