				Hi<br /><br />I just logged into my account to see there was $6 missing. I have made no orders recently and there was no record of it in my transactions.<br /><br />I wrote an email to SR staff, and when it said my email was sent, my account was short another 50 cents! in a spate of 2 minutes!<br /><br />How bizarre! But no record of it in my transactions!<br /><br />You may all want to withdraw your funds to a safe spot in the meawhile.<br /><br />Take care all

				mr_sketchy are You losing bitcoins or USD? The bitcoin price fluctuates up and down so the coins in your account are worth more or less depending from bitcoins/usd exchange price.

				Ok everyone<br /><br />I sincerely apologize. massive F**k up on my part.<br /><br />In all honesty, Im not sure why I had such a massive brain fart!<br /><br />All is well, and you need not worry about your accounts. <br /><br />There is a long winded set of circumstances which led me to believe my account had been compromised. Im not going to write an epic post detailing it, and sadly, no, I was not high! lmao<br /><br />So my apologies for the false alarm, jumping the gun and unnecessarily alarming the community.<br /><br />Get high, or stay high folks!<br />

				haha, no worries Mr. Sketch! I thank and admire you for coming back and admitting it was a fuckup on your end. I saw this when you first posted it and was a tad worried but now that you reported back saying it was nothing, I can put all those worries back on the shelf. Most folks would probably realize they did something wrong and run away cowering but props to you for admitting to some potential mistakes. We&#039;ve all been there, mate.<br /><br />~Greck

				Agree, admitting that you have some stupid mistake is action worth of respect. I wish your order arrives safe and you have a good time!
