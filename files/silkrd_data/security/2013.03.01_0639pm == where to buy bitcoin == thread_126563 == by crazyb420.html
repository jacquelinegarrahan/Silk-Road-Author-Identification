				Are you in the US? There&#039;s plenty of vendors here that will buy MoneyPaks you can pick up at a local store in cash. With some of them you will get your BTC pretty much instantly and definitely same day. If you&#039;re in Canada, I&#039;m offering a similar service; you just go to the local store and pay cash to buy a code that you can trade with me for bitcoin.<br /><br />More info here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126470.0

				bitfloor.com<br /><br />I used them to purchase my bitcoins for the first time ever a few days ago...get a tormail address, sign up at bitfloor.com (I think you only have to provide email address, no other personal info), after that click deposit, agree to their terms, input how much CASH you are depositing, then they give you the deposit info..you go to Bank of America, put in the info they give you, by the time you get home your cash will show up in your bitfloor account, then you can buy your bitcoins and transfer to where you need them to.<br /><br />also, im not sure of the link, but there is a review thread on the forums somewhere of different bitcoin websites/vendors

				Bitfloor looks great, only problem for me is no Bank of America in my area. I was going to use Bitcopia, but it seems they are also having trouble...

				I usually use bitinstant but they are down. I tried ziggap and they take a little while (about 6 hours from when I made the deposit to when I got my bitcoins) but they are legit. They accept moneygram and western union.

				https://bitcoin.de<br />You can do it instantly from your computer for a 2% fee.<br />Works only in Europe though.

				Gonna give Blue Sky Traders a shout out here. A lot like Bitfloor, simply get deposit info from them, head to Bank of America, and they will send coins straight to any BTC Address you give them.
