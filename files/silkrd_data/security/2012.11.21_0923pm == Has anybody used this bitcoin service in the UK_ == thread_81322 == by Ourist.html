				I haven&#039;t been on the road in a few months now and only just noticed that Mt.Gox stopped with the Barclays deposits..<br />&nbsp;<br />So I&#039;m just wondering if anybody has had any success with this service as they claim to allow bank deposits to their branch. Trustworthy?<br /><br />BTCXUK - http://64d7qoqgjcw47vvz.onion.to/<br /><br />

				Not myself, but I did research them on:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/<br />and found that many people trusted then and were impressed. I even thought of using them myself but then got into BTC-OTC so never got round to it. They sounded OK though.<br />

				The only thing I&#039;m concerned about is the &#039;onion.to&#039; address. I&#039;ve read that this ISN&#039;T secure - so why not either just go the full length and use &#039;.onion&#039; or, if you&#039;re not trying to be secure, just use &#039;.co.uk&#039; or something.<br /><br />What is the point of &#039;onion.to&#039;? Is it there just to LOOK LIKE &#039;.onion&#039; and trick people who don&#039;t pay closer attention into thinking they&#039;re accessing an &#039;.onion&#039; site? Just seems a bit sketchy to me.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh. I&#039;m a dumbass. I deleted &#039;.to&#039; from the end of the link and tried it in Tor... works fine. Nevermind! - glad we&#039;ve got another reliable UK bitcoin source, and not too expensive either by the sounds of it :)

				I mailed them today and they are charging 8 pound per bitcoin also you can deposit the money into a local HSBC branch which seems brilliant! Hopefully they can stick around!

People should NOT be using the &#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;onion.to&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039; site. I think this can catch new users if they are not forewarned as they will see the &#039;&#039;onion&#039;&#039;&#039; and think OK that&#039;s good and not realise the implications.<br /><br />BITCOIN-OTC recommended
