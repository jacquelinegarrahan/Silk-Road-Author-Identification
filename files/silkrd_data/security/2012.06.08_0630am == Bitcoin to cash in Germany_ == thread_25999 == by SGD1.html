				Try https://bitcoin-24.com, you only need a Email-Adress to register. You can withdraw with SEPA<br /><br />For larger amounts of money use multiple bank accounts.

Most of the checks is hidden under the guise of &quot;anti terrorism&quot;.<br /><br />You can sell to sites or trade with other people through exchanges, I know its a pain figuring what works best for you, but stick with it and you will get there.

				Hi SGD1,<br /><br />If you do open a seller account on here I&#039;d be happy to buy your BTC in exchange for cash in the mail. It will be sent from the UK but I can send Euros.<br /><br />Please send me a message if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				Well i use bitcoin.de all the time. I like that i buy from a private sellers and not a centralized one.<br /><br />Go like this:<br /><br />Bitcoin.de -&gt; Instawallet (optional) -&gt; Bitcoin Fog -&gt; Silkroad<br /><br />It may look like excessive amount of transactions but you can&#039;t be too safe. And don&#039;t forget like knomo said the action of buying Bitcoins is nowhere near illegal. Hope that helps<br /><br />P.S: been using bitcoin.de for more than half a year.

It&#039;s just a few hours for your security.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bitcoinfog can take as long as you like - the longer amount of time you leave it the better as your Bitcoins can be withdrawn and sent in random amounts. The shorter the time between your coins arriving in a mixer and being withdrawn, the greater the chance of a detailed analysis of the block chain detecting the passage of your coins through monitoring the amounts in question e.g you send USD 30,000 of Bitcoins to the Fog and then a couple of hours later USD 29,100 are sent to a different address, it wouldn&#039;t take a genius to figure out what had happened; of course this is easier to spot for larger amounts.<br /><br />SR&#039;s mixer is free of charge but for the reasons I&#039;ve outlined above it&#039;s not as secure&nbsp; - of course you could set up several accounts and withdraw your coins several times to several different wallets, in essence doing the same thing Bitcoinfog does but this is very troublesome and time consuming. <br /><br />Alternatively you could use a service like mine to change your cash to Bitcoins and mixing becomes a moot point as tracing the original transaction back to source wouldn&#039;t reveal anything about your identity - indeed even I don&#039;t know my customers&#039; real identity.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
