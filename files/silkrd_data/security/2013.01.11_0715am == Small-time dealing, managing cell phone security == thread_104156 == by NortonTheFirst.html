				I&#039;ve been dealing molly in small amounts for a few months now, just to friends and friends-of-friends.

So, I&#039;ve been having people contact me via a prepaid number that I pay for in cash. This seems pretty safe, but only as long as everyone&#039;s smart enough to not mention my name when texting me... Or in other words, probably not very fucking long.

Maybe I just need to start using an alias, but since most of these people are already friends/acquaintances there&#039;s still bound to be slip-ups... I realize this is an inherently risky, inefficient business and there might not be much more I can do, but I figure it&#039;s worth asking around. I want to make this as safe as possible both for myself and for my clients. Any advice will be much appreciated!

				Mobile phones are a drug dealers worst nightmare IMO. Yes, they are convenient, however, they can be used to record any transactions and pinpoint your location should you fall under the watchful eye of the law. Here are a couple of threads discussing accessing SR via a mobile device, however, there is an interview with a known hacking expert on how a mobile device can be used by LE should you come across their path. This is perhaps an extreme view, however, since you are selling the potential for you to be put under surveillance at some stage could very well happen.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95973.msg694044#msg694044<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98323.msg693911#msg693911

				I&#039;ve been thinking it would be a good idea to somehow physically disable my &quot;business&quot; phone&#039;s microphone, maybe by covering it in superglue, or just snipping it off the circuit board. (I only do business via text.) It&#039;d be great to physically disable the GPS too, although that would probably be a bit trickier, and I&#039;m not sure how I would verify that it was successful on a dumbphone. But GPS tracking and remote eavesdropping require a lot more time and effort on the cops&#039; part than simply reading my name out of a text message, and thus the latter is a more pressing concern to me. It would be great if I could avoid doing business over the phone completely, but that just doesn&#039;t seem realistic these days at the &quot;street level.&quot;

				I know it wouldn&#039;t be the most convenient scenario, but would it be feasible to deal using a tormail email address? Give your clients the email address and tell them to contact you that way. Only thing with that is that you&#039;d have to make very definite plans to meet people (and make sure they are punctual so you&#039;re not left hanging around) as they couldn&#039;t contact you while you were out and about. Maybe that wouldn&#039;t work, but it is something I have considered myself.

				I like your set up and your points.<br />1. Stop using your real name for dealing. Go under an alias. Not something like smokey, but something belieable, if yoru a white guy. JOHn. mexican, Jose, And so on. My buddy deals with SWIM, and i deal with SWAM. <br /><br />2. Dont even think about using an iPhone or any other smart phone.<br /><br />3.Ensure your phone has a lock code that activates instantly. If you back up, make sure thats encrypted. Cops tend to go through phones after they handcuff you. Say you forgot the code. And forget it. <br /><br />4. dont send pictures, revealing texts, or names. or drug names. <br /><br />5. Im not sure how effective using &quot;t-shirts&quot; is. Its OLD school. but it makes me feel better. and frankly, isnt that what were here for?!<br /><br />6. To be honest with you. Unless your right below a top level dealer or just being crass with your dealing. Nobody is surveying you. Depends on your location and jurisdiction. My city has 8 million people per square mile. (ive said too much!) so its easier to fall through the cracks. Sleepy texas cops, whole different story. Arent burner phones like 35 bucks? if you cant burn a phone a month. Your doing it wrong. Think of it as stay out of jail fee. Beats the alternative. But unless your up there.. or beign sloppy with your money or flashing or bragging. That&#039;ll take you down faster than any cellphone trace or GPS leak. <br /><br />IMHO<br /><br />7. Listen to &quot;Ten crack commandments&quot; by biggie. it&#039;ll put you on the way to be being a hustler/dealer.<br /><br /><br />

Its just a part of not getting caught. You get caught when you get lazy. Think of it as very cheap insurance.<br /><br />Now what your friends do is beyond your control. Just simply don&#039;t deal with them if they are asking of the phone/via text. Tell them a simple &#039;hey man, stop by when you get a chance&#039; is all they need to mention via txt. Tell them not to try and use code (I.E.&nbsp; &#039;i&#039;m out of sugar, you got any?&quot;), it&#039;s not going to fool anyone. Establish their regular amount and just bring that when you stop by.&nbsp; This elimantes them coming to your place and by bringing only a small amount, it wont be considered distribution should you get popped by copper.<br /><br />If they still fuck up, ignore them or have them get ahold of you through a friend. Dave (user) tells bob (mutal friend) to tell chris (the dealer) to give him a call. Chris calls with a new burner number.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in others ideas as well.<br /><br />Edit: also, if you&#039;re looking for even more security, do not bring your mobile with you when you make delivery. Read burb on the clearnet called &quot;the snitch in your pocket&#039;, cellphone = bad bad.

				why dont you use emails instead of texting? <br />you can still do it on a telephone, all you need is internet access. some phones can run tor. maybe you could use tormail?<br />you could teach your clients how to use it...

				Here&#039;s what to do:<br /><br />1. Download and instal Phonecopy. It works with every phone and will let you copy your contacts every time you get a new phone.<br />2. Get a second-hand phone or buy a burner one that isn&#039;t linked to your name.<br />3. Buy a sim-card and register it in a fake name from an internet cafe or over Tor.<br />4. Invent a fake name for yourself, that doesn&#039;t sound stupid and make EVERYONE save it in their phone. When meeting new people, introduce yourself as your made-up name.<br />5. NO NAMES, NO PLACES, NO DRUGS mentioned on the phone. Explain this to everyone you give your number to. Refer to everyone by a fake name and give every location you normally meet people at a fake name (I use the names of bars and restaurants around my city). Don&#039;t say the names of any drugs on the phone either and try and avoid referring to amounts of drugs or money. If any numbers and maths need to be communicated, send people a Privnote.com address so they can read it from the internet on their phone. If the cops tap your phone it should just sound like you have a lot of friends you go to bars and restaurants with.<br />6. Keep conversations as short as possible and if anyone says something suss HANG UP IMMEDIATELY. They will get the message quickly.<br />7. Disable the GPS on the phone if it&#039;s a smart-phone<br />8. If you have a business partner have a phone you have just for communicating with them. I have a phone just for the people I get on from, a phone just for having conversations with my business partner with and a phone I carry with me just for my customers. I change all numbers regularly but the number I use for customers I change the most often. I try and only carry one phone on me when i&#039;m out of the house.<br />9. If you&#039;re ever asked why you have several phones on you say you own 2 different online business&#039;s and that way you know what it&#039;s about whenever the phone rings.<br /><br />Follow these simple steps and you will be safe.

You&#039;re under estimating the methods used by LE should you come to their attention. Fake names, implying you own online businesses and minimizing conversations will not prevent LE from gathering the information they require for a successful prosecution. Turning off a smart phones does absolutely nothing to prevent prying eyes from determining your location. Phones are like having a tracking device fitted. The best thing a dealer could do is use encrypted emails via PGP (GPG) sent through a secure service such as Tor mail. Privnote is NOT in anyway a secure method of communication, firstly requiring Javascript to be enabled (creating vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited) and secondly, leaving your sent Privnote email on a third party server in Plain Text, easily recoverable and able to be read by anyone who looks. Mobile Phones are convenient but will be the nail in the coffin if you or your customers come to the attention of LE. Mobile devices are LE&#039;s first step in acquiring information on suspects or person&#039;s of interest, and is definitely the most fruitful option available to them regarding the gathering of intelligence or potential evidence. If you look at past drug cases world wide, you&#039;ll see just how much incriminating evidence was gathered from the use of mobile phones in most, if not all cases. I&#039;ve read transcripts which all document the ability of LE to gather detailed information which was able to be used to prosecute those charged.

				You need to be worrying about them mentioning your name when they get busted. Not while texting. You worrying about them finding out your name from texting is a complete waste of time because if they get busted they&#039;re gonna make them talk anyway. Deal on the internet and not in person.

				http://www.sms2email.com/site/sms2email.php <br /><br />This is an SMS forwarder, you can give it&#039;s&nbsp; phone number to your buyer.&nbsp; He can send an SMS to that, starting with your email address along with his order. The SMS gets forwarded to your e-mail account.<br /><br />No phone number that leads to you, only an e-mail address which can be registered anonymously (eg. tormail), you can read the emails with a smart phone (via Orbot) on the go.<br /><br />This way the contact can reach you via phone without an internet connection and you can receive it with your via internet without giving out your phone number.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This thread has some great ideas. Reading through silk road forums it&#039;s clear that the majority of posts are not from major players but more from curious small timers looking to earn a little cash here and there. <br /><br />Agreed, texting over the normal cell phone airwaves is a terrible idea. <br />Yet texting if done correctly can be a great way to sort out the much smaller orders for close friends etc. I&#039;ve been using an incredible app for a while now. <br /><br />Wickr. Free app for iOS and Android. <br />Encrypted text messaging sent between devices with automatic message deletion after a set time.<br />You set yourself a master password and create a username with no other information needed.<br />Get your friends to ONLY message you here for anything drugs related. <br />https://www.mywickr.com/en/myapp.php<br /><br />&quot;From Wickr Website&quot;<br />For message encryption, Wickr&#039;s patent-pending &#039;Digital Security Bubble&#039; relies on both the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric block cipher implemented with random 256-bit keys and the asymmetric RSA-4096 algorithm.<br />Messages are encrypted by the sending device, sent through our service and provider networks in encrypted form, and decrypted by the receiving device. Our servers never process or store unencrypted messages nor are they ever in possession of the keys to decrypt them. <br /><br />Certainly would recommend it as a small time solution. <br />

				STOP USING TEXT MESSAGES&nbsp; and DO NOT use google voice services!&nbsp; google logs everything and cooperates with the law!&nbsp; text messages leave a nasty trail, no one deletes them, and the amount of hdd space it takes to record every text msg you ever sent and recieved in your life is less than a gig.&nbsp; skimming through recorded texts doesnt take long compared to having to listen to conversations.&nbsp; but your small time, i wouldnt worry too much about that shit. <br />also dont use orbot for android, it isnt secure!&nbsp; never use silk road from your phone, are you kidding!<br /><br />2 cents.<br />

				there is absolutely no reason for drug deals to be done without encryption and anonymity. Tell your friends to get smartphones and gibberbot otr , then they can hit you up via encrypted text that is routed through Tor.

				Our buyers text a six-digit code which tells us where to find their address, which is hand-written inside a book within a warehouse of books which I own. Once the text is acknowledged, they text a single digit which indicates the amount they desire. We only sell one product, so the only thing to specify is the amount. That amount is then delivered to the address associated with the code, never to any other address or location. Half the delivery locations are not even the buyers&#039; homes, but public places like parks or restaurants. The phone number to text changes every three weeks or so. To find the new number, buyers go to a certain Facebook page and look at the cover photo. The photo shows a wholesome looking white couple standing on the front lawn of a house, and in the background is a for sale sign. The phone number is on the for sale sign as if it were the number of the realtor&#039;s office. We only use two names in our operation, one male and one female, and everyone goes by one of the two names depending on their gender. At the same time, we know (most of) the actual names of the buyers and routinely check arrest records, which are public information in our state. If a buyer gets popped, we will hopefully know about it and be on the alert. I&#039;m sure there are holes in this plan, but it&#039;s what we&#039;ve come up with so far.

				I&#039;ll let you know that cell phone security should be one of the least of your worries when it comes to dealing. Tbh you shouldn&#039;t be using text messages to make deals unless you are using an encryption program (Such as Wickr) to secure all of your texts. <br /><br />The people I know who have been busted by cops for dealing have all been small time and have sold to just their friends. Just as the OP stated. <br /><br />The way cops do it is they will bust one of your clientele, your close friend from school for example. The cops will then ask the guy where he got the goods from and to go pick up from you again very casually or he will go to prison. Business is conducted normally (Obviously your &quot;friend&quot; is going to shit them self and not cover for you) and boom cops bust you the next day. This is how most people got caught in my experience. Cell phone text messages and such are just extra evidence used to prosecute you. <br /><br />There are ways I prevent things like this from happening...Although they may or maynot work. They are definitely much safer than just texting each other back and forth. And may also make you harder to track and prosecute. <br /><br />This is for &quot;small time&quot; dealing of course.<br />1. Use encryption (Wickr) if you are going to be texting. Call them if possible/needed.<br />2. If you&#039;re dealing molly. I personally do not sell to people when its not &quot;rave season&quot;. Most of my sales come around the times when festivals and such are coming up. If New Years just ended...why the fuck are you trying to pick up a jar from me?&nbsp; Meet up with people. Tell them you have a supply for this show coming up. Get it off your hands ASAP (Although most usually wait until the last minute -___-).<br />3. Do not sell to someone more than once (Or in multiple instances). Keep it quick and simple. Let them know to get their order in and that you have a limited supply. If they keep picking up from you on multiple occasions there could be a chance (or they will increase the chance) they got/get busted and you know...(Refer to above).<br />4. Deal with people who are intelligent and are not likely to get caught with your shit. Don&#039;t deal to that that sketch meth addict down the street. Also, If you can...Sell in bulk. Less money but way more secure...which is most important here.<br />5. Make it CLEAR to your &quot;friends&quot; not to give out your personal information (Name, Number, Etc). <br />6. Keep your house clean at all times. That means no empty caps. No scales. No drugs. Nothing. Figure out a stash spot unrelated to you...A trustworthy colleagues house? Pay him XXX bucks And swing by when you need you to do work. Cops will search your house if you get busted. <br />7. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT USE FACEBOOK. Just ignore/delete all messages that have anything to do with drugs and dealing.<br />8. And lastly...if it seems sketch...just don&#039;t deal with it. You can never be too paranoid (Well sort of hah). <br /><br />I think that&#039;s it. Criticism is welcome. I am not saying this is full-proof in anyway although most of of these things are just common sense. But this is what I feel keeps me the most secure when I&#039;m dealing with my friends.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				Fuck, I deal.. I&#039;d say pretty small time, I make anywhere from 500 to 1000 bucks a month, only to friends but I dont use any security at all really. <br /><br />occasionally I&#039;ll do a larger deal to a friend of a friend of a friend and I get a bit paranoid, but other than that I don&#039;t really see how the police would catch me. I mean, dont they first have to have some evidence to start searching texts and emails?<br /><br />I fucking hate the police, what a bunch of losers. Seriously.

				best bet for IRL dealing is to anonymously take orders and payment (bitcoin is nice), and then dead drop the product and anonymously send the drop location to your client. GPS can be used for determining the location of the drop, and for the client locating it. That way even if one of your clients is busted, they cannot get you in a controlled buy as you always drop the drugs and never hand them off. And the money is not going to be marked or tied to you either. Of course to make this system as best as it can be, your clients should not know who you are either. There are a few ways you can accomplish this, perhaps a few highly trusted friends can know the deal and spread around business cards with your anonymous contact information on them or something.

Just demand a lawyer. Talking to them can&#039;t help you, it can only be used against you. Don&#039;t try to be a smart ass and think otherwise, doing so will nothing but harm you and we wouldn&#039;t want that now would we. There&#039;s tons of law professors on YouTube that&#039;ll tell you the exact same thing. So don&#039;t fuck up on this easy part.
