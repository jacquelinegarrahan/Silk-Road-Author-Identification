				I think Silk Road is a catalyst that is getting Bitcoin up to speed for it&#039;s real launch that is just starting now. I think SR will be less important once the worlds people discover how great Btc is. SR has been a great catalyst. I think there were many and they could have gotten this thing going without SR. SR just accelerated the process. The break-all-the-rules (or at least a bunch of them) strategy in place here makes us a great advertisement for the currency (bad press is good press, extra bad press is extra good I think, lol). <br /><br />The banks of the world are owned by people who, if you believe the Zeitgeist-style conspiracy-type theories, make interest on almost every piece of legal-tender in circulation. My overgeneralized perception of these people is that they are often evil and obscenely rich.<br /><br />Bitcoins are apparently an attempt to break away from these rich people&#039;s hold on our money supply at the same time as breaking our governments control over use of money. So, it is, in theory, a Freedom Currency we should support and nurture if we believe in freedom, liberty, justice,...... <br /><br />Of course the richest and most powerful forces on earth (and their governments) would seem to be greatly threatened by a wildly successful Bitcoin-type currency becoming mainstream on an international scale. The current rise in Btc value may scare the heck out of the people who manage the rich peoples money? I think it should. I don&#039;t think this is gonna stop going up unless something drastic happens to stop it (us).<br /><br />The advisors of the richest 0.00001% are not stupid either. They may well be behind the Btc growth as a way to help the rich become more obscenely rich and/or to try and destroy the Btc in some way I have not imagined yet? Maybe they own the Bitcoin mining conglomerates and/or Sell them their mining tech gear? This stuff is so mind boggling it makes me wanna order something off SR to sooth the brain :-)<br /><br />Oh Ya, it is also great for cheating the governments out of their share. Possibly even more aggravating to those who run the world, this can also, so far, be used to keep the likes of Google from knowing who is interested in what and when and where. IT mega corps may not take kindly to our attempts to take financial anonymity mainstream.<br />So, it is an amazing time to be alive/own Bitcoins and Sail the Seas Mateys ;-) NWN<br /><br />BTW, I have very little facts or evidence to back up my wild speculations, so, take &#039;em with a grain of salt water :-)

				I agree with NW Nugz<br />Sr is just accelerating the rise of the BTC, recent events in Cyprus as well.<br />clearnet warning: http://www.cnbc.com/id/100597242<br /><br />My thoughts are bitcoins, if they are really reliable,&nbsp; are going to change the bank system as we know it, banks will have to adapt if they can.<br /><br />like mp3 changed the way we consume music&nbsp; :) <br /><br /><br />

				Let&#039;s get this into perspective:<br />Currently there are 10.96 million BTC with a total value of 1.03 billion dollars at $94.<br />SR revenues are estimated to be 1.7 million dollars/month<br />This is 0.015% of the total BTC value.<br />SR is just another drop in the BTC bucket that is now fueled by growing demand in the Eurozone where 300 million people look for an alternative to Euros.<br />Add in worldwide publicity for BTC which are an extremely tiny market compared to other asset classes.<br />It is your guess where BTC will trade if only 1 million people want to buy 1 BTC out of curiosity.<br />This will rocket BTC past the moon.<br /><br />It has a negative side effect, though: We have delayed all purchases and now we will have only a very frugal Easter party holiday.<br />But I will be compensated as I can already buy twice as many drugs since I deposited my BTC into SR. :P <br />I guess I will wait until my deposit has risen another 20% or so to $110 before I place my next order.<br />

				Just thinking in general/speculating...<br /><br />So with the Cyprus banks reopen now<br /><br />*Some* People will be withdrawing money out and possibly exchanging for a different currency.<br /><br />And with the withdrawl limit in place, could be a slow and steady rise of BC?<br />
