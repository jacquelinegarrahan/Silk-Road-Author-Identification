				Hopefully security is the best forum for this topic. I&#039;m going to a fest this summer. It&#039;s going to have a ton of jam-bands and I fully expect there to be plenty of people on different plains of reality. With that being said, I&#039;m a bit worried about security while I&#039;m there. It&#039;s a three day event with camping and I don&#039;t know if there will be LE presence since I&#039;ve never been there and I don&#039;t know anybody that has. It&#039;s in the mountains in what I believe is a fairly rural area. Anyway, back to my point:<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for people who have been to similar fests and I&#039;d like to hear their experiences. How paranoid should I be about hiding my stuff? What might be a good way to hide it? I expect to have at least ten 00 size gel caps and maybe some edibles. I probably won&#039;t try to bring anything smokeable since I&#039;m not confident that I&#039;ll have a place to smoke it. I should be able to get to my car if I need to but I don&#039;t think it will be close by.

				The cops aren&#039;t stupid. They know what goes on at festivals. If you don&#039;t act like an idiot you probably won&#039;t be bothered. And if it&#039;s on private property there may only be cops outside of the property making sure no one is driving like an idiot. <br /><br />Basically, don&#039;t stick out too much and don&#039;t taunt them with what you&#039;re doing and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll leave you alone.

				after a certain 1000 number of people there is always going to be a place to smoke weed ect at fest. most cops working at them dont care about drug use, only dealing and violence. you will be able to smoke at the campsite easy. its hard to know what to advise you on in terms of serious stashing without more info on the festivals policy on bringing in glass/your own food, but i think if you use your brain with that you should be ok

				You&#039;re going to a music festival and you&#039;re worried about not being able to smoke pot? Lol, I think you&#039;re in for a pleasant surprise. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not selling anything then you have nothing to worry about.

				I frequented a reoccurring music fest for many years (last i knew IRS shut it down :( ). What I noticed is that the LE presence increased every year. It was private property and NEVER any arrests at the fest itself.. but ROADBLOCKS were a HUGE problem near the entrance. These small town cops would look forward all year to these fests... But like I said, I got worse as the fest got bigger. If its a fairly new event, it might not be so bad.. but if its annual and has a large following Id recommend being careful and looking into diversion safes (pop can hidden stash box), they blend in well with a cooler of sodas.

				As long as you don&#039;t run around with drugs in the open, you should be fine. LE is definitely at festivals but they&#039;re really after distributors.

				^Yeah, plus I don&#039;t think any local PD has the manpower to arrest all the thousands of drug users at these events, or even do selective busts. They might cause a panic with that shit. If things get out of hand and they call in a raid to grab anyone for anything, getting caught with stuff is a liability though. Make sure you can quickly and easily get rid of everything by eating it if at all possible; distribute the stash between friends if you have that much.

				Thanks for all the feedback. They&#039;re not allowing any glass but we can bring our own food and drink so maybe a soda can stash would be good. Any of those for sale on SR? That&#039;s not the type of thing I&#039;d want to buy with my credit card.

				Its crazy you ask.. I am about to start a vendor page soon and will offer these cans. Also &quot;Party In A Can&quot; for combo deals and (what i hope is) bullet proof shipping.<br /><br />I got my first diversion safe can at a local head shop, But if you have the right tools you can look up a DIY tutorial online. Well worth the investment as they could prove to raid-proof in many situations. <br /><br />

				At a lot of festivals we have here the cops come inside and check out whats going on... often just to make sure that everyone is being peaceful etc (lol once i was at this festival and one of the cops was obviously a noob; he wore a thick bulletproof vest to a festival, in australia, in the middle of summer)<br /><br />however we have heard of undercovers going in and requesting to buy drugs from people at random... (easiest way to get around this is only accept recommended customers, not randoms who are asking you for illicit substances).<br /><br />By the end of the night you pretty much know most of the main wacked out hippies anyway (they are the only ones who have kept you company throughout the night and are still awake/wired the morning) and you could probs go up to those guys and start a convo to sell...<br /><br />but as far as use goes. you are pretty much fine, at least at most of the festivals where it is appropriate to go on a bit of a bender. Some of the festivals here are not that kind of thing (most of the ones without camping that are really near the city) and those ones they actively search people for drugs on entry, Sniffer dogs the whole shebang.<br />I usually just see those as a waste of time; if i cant have my freedom to feel safe having and doing illicit substances in a safe manner at a festival then thats too far. i just wont go to that festival. ill go to an underground one which the cops cant turn up at (because its deep in the bush on private property :-P)<br /><br />anyway you should be fine if its a decent festival and you aren&#039;t a jew in occupied poland.<br />be smart, and safe. better to be safe than buttfucked in jail (if you are in US, here you would probably just get a fine maybe have to go to court ordered rehab).

				Play it smart and you&#039;ll be safe, no matter where your fest is.<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort anything in large crowds, if you&#039;re purchasing there be VERY discreet, and if you think someone&#039;s LE....they&#039;re definitely LE<br /><br />Undercovers in fests are SO easy to spot, just look for the 35yo dressed like an 18yo candy kid and standing awkwardly not under the influence of anything fun&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And DO NOT leave the fest grounds with any goodies on your person.
