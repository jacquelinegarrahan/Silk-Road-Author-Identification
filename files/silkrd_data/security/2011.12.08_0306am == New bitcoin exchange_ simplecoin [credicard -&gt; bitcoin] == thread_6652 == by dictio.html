				I&#039;ll not waste time by explaining it, you&#039;re all bright people with minds enough to decide whether it&#039;s legit.<br /><br />I will say though, however, that at worst they charge (at current 3 bitcoin to 1 USD) $4.14 per coin for 0-24 coins, $3.73 for 25-75, and $3.52 for 75+.<br /><br />Goes without saying that some tumbling may need to go on. I suppose it&#039;s worth it if there&#039;s really no other way for you to get coins. <br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=53803.0 [Thread with owner answering questions.]<br /><br />http://simplecoin.com/buy-bitcoins [Checkout page.]<br /><br />

				Just ordered bitcoins from simplecoin. Very quick processing, coins were charged to my card within minutes.&nbsp; Simplecoin account status says coins were delivered, but not showing up in my silk road account yet. I&#039;ll update when/if the coins show up in my account.

				Is it me or is that a pretty hefty tax?? I don&#039;t think I paid nearly that kind of tax the last time I bought coins..<br /><br />Nice to see CCs in the picture tho, cos that probably means they&#039;d accept the kind that you can just buy with cash, so another str8 cash to btc option within a couple hours.. Nice.

				This is a pretty hefty tax, but that&#039;s the beauty of a free market, we have choices, we&#039;re not forced to use them, we have them as a convenient option.<br /><br />What would be bad, is if our government, were to subsidies them! <br /><br />Because our government saw the need for a service such as this, and because of all the new gov. regulation attached to every transaction it may not be very profitable......but, because there is a need for such a convenient service, our gov decides to prop them up with large subsidies in the form of forgivable grants in order to make sure there able to provide this service, because our gov never looked at he hidden consequences of such actions, only regulated, and then made new regulations, to keep the regulators and the regulated in line, and of course the fees that must now be placed upon each transaction in order to cover the cost of all the paychecks and so forth for all the bureaucrats it now takes to regulate this industry.........Now, the &quot;Average Joe Bit Coin Processing Co&quot; can no longer afford to cover these cost, or much less make a profit, so he rolls up the sidewalk in front of his little shop and calls it quits.<br /><br />Now were left with a highly regulated CC to Bitcoin Processing Co, that charges ungodly amounts of money per transaction, to cover the cost of all the bureaucracy now in play, and they wouldn&#039;t be here either, but thank god they got that Gov Grant, that help them pay all the fees and so forth.<br /><br />sounds good huh, but now they would need to have photo Id of everyone making a transaction (for your safety of course), in order to purchase the coins......... there goes our anonymity! when it comes to the gov, they can always make it impossible for us to be free, the problem is we never see it coming!<br /><br />LOL <br /><br />Naw it seems like a pretty cool service, and thanks for posting this new option for everyone, I was really only concerned with a couple of aspects of the service.<br /><br />1. sending coin straight to SR!<br /><br />2. Straight from their site:<br /><br />&quot;Verify Your Phone Number....Our checkout process is very straightforward. We will, however, require you to verify the billing phone number you provide us. We do this by placing a phone call or SMS message to the phone number, and you in turn provide the PIN you are called with or receive in SMS on your order form.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Now correct me if I&#039;m wrong here (I am a noob) But, it seems to me if you had them load the coin directly to your SR account, you would be married to that SR account then, and every transaction made from it!<br /><br />Just a few thoughts, see what happens when you read?,

				I&#039;ve actually been in contact with the owner. The reason they are down is not due to any massive charges. They do &#039;human,&#039; as well as phone verification of the cards. It was beginning to take them hours to get coins out the door, so they pulled the service down temporarily. <br /><br />Basically, they didn&#039;t buy enough rackspace at the datacenter.

				Awesome business model, but I bet they didn&#039;t architect the requirements of doing business before opening.&nbsp; They needed to identify all stakeholders and have work flows in place prior to launching and maybe run their data through a few thousand iterations for the range of &quot;most likely&quot; functionality of activities, they would have gotten worst, most likely, and optimum data from those iterations..&nbsp; If they had, then they would have had some risk mitigation in place for the inevitable base on the range of report for those iterations.&nbsp;

				https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=53803.80<br /><br />That thread has a lot of info on simplecoin.com, like that fact that they don&#039;t accept prepaid mobile phones. They are thinking about doing it later on when they get more up and running. Its just for fraud prevention for now. They also said they would be up and running again on the 13th, but they haven&#039;t posted back since the 12th. I check it daily because when they get running again im gunna make my first purchase. I will either use my CC or a prepaid one and my real phone, but if i put it in instawallet or whatever its called and then in my SR account i should be good and not have it trace back...right? or should i go threw bitcoin fog?

				This sounds like another option that would be nice to have if you need your BTC quickly. Too bad they&#039;ve been down for so long, I hope they are up and running again soon. I would like to look into this and see how much they tax you at current BTC prices.
