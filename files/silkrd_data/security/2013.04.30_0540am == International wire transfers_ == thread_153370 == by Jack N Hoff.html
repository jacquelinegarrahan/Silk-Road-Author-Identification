				Do you need ID to send a several thousand dollar international wire transfer?&nbsp; I&#039;m very tired of having to drive all over and pay high fees to structure payments through other anonymous means.

				Jack,<br /><br />It depends on the country. I can only tell you the situation in Europe - they will ask for ID in 99.99% of the cases. I am not sure what the situation is in the States or elsewhere. But when I say Europe I mean the mainland, UK has not IDs and I&#039;ve heard people doing wire transactions without having to show any ID, or maybe some Mickey Mouse stuff like Student ID. Back in the 1990s people were able to open bank accounts in the UK with just proof of latest utility bill. <br /><br />Peace,

				Oh by the way, Almost all wire transfers will require ID in the US, domestic or International.

				Outgoing transfers will ALWAYS require an ID. Otherwise some bloke could just run into the bank pretending to be you and initiate a transfer anywhere. Wire transfers internationally are also a huge red flag for banks as it is the primary means of fraudsters who steal bank info online getting their hands on cash.&nbsp; You need an ID to even get a balance inquiry at 99% of banks nowadays.

You must have an account with the bank to process it I believe.

				A good fake ID + Western Union/Moneygram<br /><br />It must be GOOD though. Not the IDs you used when you were 19 to get into bars. There are pros on other private forums who offer this type of service.&nbsp;

I went to the bank and asked them whether I need to show ID when sending money via WU. They told me it is required. It makes sense to ask for an ID when receiving money via WU, but even this is questionable since you should have the code and/ or the answer to the secret question. They are fucking us over and over again, and it&#039;s getting worse by the hour.<br /><br />Have you tried the fake ID plus WU method? Both for sending and receiving? Was it in Europe?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />
