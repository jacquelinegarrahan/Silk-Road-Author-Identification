				Police came and had a package that was addressed to me with some powder in it.<br /><br />Ofcourse I do not know of anything, but nobody could know I was there. There will be an investigation where it came from and who ordered it.<br /><br />I did leave my phone on the table with torbot and firefox or something. Perhaps they could track this?<br /><br />Any steps that need to be taken?<br /><br />I of course know nothing of no drugs.

				We need info.&nbsp; Former LEO here, feel free to PM me.&nbsp; Did they serve a search warrant and seize your phone, or merely come to your door with questions?&nbsp; If they merely came to your door, did they seize your phone (we had a whole thread on the seized phone situation earlier)?&nbsp; Are you in the Americas, Europe, or other?&nbsp; <br /><br />If the answer is that they didn&#039;t do a search and didn&#039;t seize your phone, then you must assume the worst.&nbsp; Assume that they are using that package as probable cause for a search warrant, and that you don&#039;t have long.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have a shredder, that sucks.&nbsp; If you have any incriminating paperwork, find a way to hide it, if you must keep it.&nbsp; Find a way to burn it or shred it if you don&#039;t.&nbsp; Same with your drugs.&nbsp; Do a double Truecrypt setup on your computer:&nbsp; all the incriminating shit with a password you can remember, hidden, and a non-hidden encrypted drive with porn on it.&nbsp; Make the PW something obvious, like &quot;porn&quot;.<br /><br />Assuming you&#039;re in America, you may not have days; you may just have hours.&nbsp; You might have less than that.&nbsp; Or maybe they&#039;re not coming at all.&nbsp; But you have to get ready for a home invasion by the police.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve never been in trouble with the law before, it won&#039;t be the SWAT team, unless it was a lot of drugs, or you own a lot of guns.&nbsp; If you do own a lot of guns, make sure they are all unloaded.&nbsp; When they come, comply fully with them, but answer none of their questions.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; They are required by law to read you the warrant.&nbsp; Before they ask you any questions, they will read you your rights. The next words out of your mouth should be &quot;I have nothing to say until my attorney is present.&quot;&nbsp; By law, they can no longer question you.&nbsp; They will either arrest you for whatever they find in your house, or they will leave.&nbsp; Oh, and if you have balls, and they don&#039;t arrest you, you&#039;ll sue them for the damage to your door.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Good luck!

				That sucks to hear my friend. Hope it all works out for you. Obviously anyone could have sent you powder in the mail :)<br />As for your phone, what do you mean it was on the table? They took it off your table? Or it was in the table when they came to your house?

				I didn&#039;t know of anything and they didnt check my phone.<br /><br />Everybody could&nbsp; have send it.<br />Investigation will probably start there and search for prints and lead to nowhere.<br /><br />Otherwise people could just ruin other peoples lives by sending drugs through mail and then calling the cops...<br /><br />They must have better things to do than to check where some grams of something came from. Like solving murders or something...<br /><br />Just a bit confused because of the former cia internet detective thread where he said each time a usb stick or whatyever is plugged in is logged and screenshots are made. They can crack bitlocker etc.<br /><br />Now read my thread about my 100%bitlocker encrypted drive 99.5% truecrypt without format encryption failure and now unusable.<br />How would they make it usable? I want my data back. And how can I see what usb thing was stuck where and when and where are those screenshots well hidden ??

				If they come with a warrant they will seize all of your electronic devises, phones, computers, USB&#039;s, hard drives, the lot!<br /><br />You should get anything incriminating out of your home immediately (drugs, paraphernalia, empty packaging that has once contained illegal substances etc...) if you are unable to safely encrypt your computer files and it doesn&#039;t sound like you have achieved that move or redact the lot.

				I&#039;d physically destroy all hard drives and USB sticks you have just in case, or if you think you have time run DBAN or active kill disk on the hard drives and storage devices ASAP. Upload any data you want to save in encrypted containers somewhere on the internet, like a random email account. Computer police are much smarter than regular LE. Get any drugs you might have at your house and get them out of there, put them in a glass coffee tin, wrap waterproof tape around the seam and bury them in the nearest woods at the base of a tree you can find your way back to at a later date. I&#039;d wipe or replace your phone too if you&#039;ve been on Silk Road on that, the best way to do that quickly is to smash it and chuck the pieces in the nearest river.<br /><br />Next time don&#039;t order drugs with your name on them. That might be fine if you order one package at a time to your home address occasionally for personal use, but that shit just helps them build a case if they seize multiple packages from different destinations with the same name. Use drop addresses and different names. Unless you want cops coming to your house, keep that shit away from where you sleep.

				Why would you conduct any business on SR using a mobile phone?? As far as Bitlocker encrypting my sensitive files/info, I wouldn&#039;t trust Microsoft with this important task, ever. Take the time to learn about staying safe and what it actually entails. It&#039;s more than just downloading software to your PC and logging on. There is so much info. here on the forums covering all this.

				A lot of people are giving you some good advice and all you keep doing is questioning them. I suggest you invest some time in the security section and read up on encryption etc instead of second guessing those who are trying to help you mate.<br /><br />Using a mobile is not as secure a connection as you should be using imho. Others may disagree with that but at the end of the day mate you do what you think is best, personally I would never use a mobile phone for anything TOR or SR related but that&#039;s just me.

A couple of reasons that come to mind are - <br /><br />1. After the question of using a mobile device was put to SR Support, they responded by saying (I&#039;m paraphrasing here) that Tor was not designed for use with mobile phones and at this point, they don&#039;t recommend accessing SR on a mobile phone using Tor.<br /><br />2. There is an interview with Jacob Applebaum, a world renowned hacker, where he details just a few of the many techniques which can be used by a hacker to divulge the information they require from a mobile phone. There are some ingenious ideas described in detail by Jacob which illustrate how a skilled hacker can get what they want if so desired.<br /><br />Another reason iOS is insecure is because the majority of users don&#039;t disable scripts and browser add-ons when browsing using a mobile device (including Android devices), meaning your real I.P Address, Location, etc can be given away very easily using Java drive by&#039;s, Javascript exploits (could be sent to your phone hidden in phone updates), etc. <br /><br />Like samesame posted, do as you please mate. You could show others the courtesy of looking through the forums first for answers to your questions before asking them for the umpteenth time. A little effort goes a long way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

Tor apps such as Onion Browser and Orbot/Orweb are not safe IMO to prevent any chance of you compromising your anonymity.Onion Browser, for example, doesn&#039;t allow the user to disable Javascript. Most people know the vulnerabilities in Javascript can be easily exploited to do a host of things.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; I mean really you couldn&#039;t even access Sr unless you were secure right?&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyone could download Tor, run the software and connect to SR. Doing so DOES NOT make your system secure in any way. Security is so much more and should be taken seriously if you value and want to protect what you have in life.<br />I don&#039;t want to sound rude mate, but your comment tells me you have no comprehension of what being secure and protecting your anonymity is and are liable to make serious mistakes in your SR activities which could very well jeopardize life as you know it. Don&#039;t under estimate the Police and what they plan to do at some stage to tackle the issue of SR. When they implement certain strategies to obtain their objectives, it will be those who are complacent in their attitude who will wear the brunt of things.&nbsp; <br />What are the benefits of running Tor through certain apps? What would this achieve for you? <br /><br />

				I&#039;m surfing using a mobile browser myself, the main problems are that you&#039;re not able to quickly wipe or eject like you can with a PC. If my door was being kicked in and I was on Tails I could just reboot my laptop and I&#039;m clean, with my phone I have to manually wipe the thing using the recovery partition.<br /><br />OP should wipe his phone, throw his drugs away and never order to that address again. Also leave negative feedback for that vendor for having shit stealth that fucking ruined his ability to order.<br /><br />No need to burn your house down and smash all your computers up like people here are suggesting. Secure wipe everything and don&#039;t worry to much.<br /><br />And no, your operating system doesn&#039;t take screenshots every time you insert a USB disk, though it will leave a record that some disk was attached. dban and move on, don&#039;t panic.

TrueCrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks which are also present in other software-based disk encryption software such as BitLocker. To prevent these attacks, TrueCrypt requires users to follow various security precautions. These are documented on the Truecrypt website. Here&#039;s the link - warning CLEARNET - http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume-precautions.&nbsp; :)

This person created Silk Road and IMO, would be in the best position to offer any advice about accessing and using the site safely. Perhaps with further development it could be used safely down the line at some stage into the future but I for one will certainly be waiting til I&#039;m on my PC to access Tor and SR rather than using a mobile phone to do so. To be confident about the unknown is a very dangerous way of thinking IMO.

				What&#039;s got me in lost right now is, why would a cop come to his house knock on the door and show him the package ask if it was his and leave? Scare tactic? No. Was it a uniform, plain clothes, or a guy in a suit? Was he alone or did he have a partner with him that was roaming around the outside of your house? You sure it was a POLICE officer and not a post office investigator? Because they too carry badges. You should of asked him for his card. This whole thing just seems odd

Aside from that, using Windows for anything like this is generally a bad idea if you have security in mind. Also that kind of attack is possible for nearly any kind of hard drive encryption, not just TrueCrypt, in TC&#039;s online documentation they have already taken these kinds of attacks into consideration.<br /><br />&quot;The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, e.g. avoid running non-trusted executables with administrative privileges. The second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if he/she suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she does not trust, by booting TrueCrypt&#039;s Rescue Disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk and restoring boot loader in MBR.&quot;<br /><br />From Wikipedia

TrueCrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks which are also present in other software-based disk encryption software such as BitLocker. To prevent these attacks, TrueCrypt requires users to follow various security precautions. These are documented on the Truecrypt website. Here&#039;s the link - warning CLEARNET - http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume-precautions.&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />oki&nbsp; :P<br /><br />clearweb aleart!!!<br /><br />hxxp://www.stoned-vienna.com/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Firstly, it doesn&#039;t work on 64 bit systems (although they are looking at changing this through the next update)<br />The Stoned Bootkit for Windows has the potential to bypass Truecrypts Full-Disk Encryption, but only if the user is lax in their knowledge of security and he/she doesn&#039;t understand the basics. This is the case for most targeted attacks being successful.<br />The Stoned Bootkit is able to bypass Full-Disk Encryption by attaching itself to the Master Boot Record (containing the Decryption Software which asks for a password and decrypts the drive) and over-writing it with Stone&#039;s own boot software. The MBR is NOT encrypted which is what allows this to happen.<br />It can only be installed three ways. Running an executable file (.exe), Physical access via a live CD / USB or through a PDF exploit, which can be overcome by either using a VM or opening the PDF on a PC never connected to the internet, since the exploit used only installs a small dropper and downloads the infector from the internet when the PDF file is opened. Better still, this can be easily avoided by not opening the file at all.<br />By not running any executable files or downloading and opening any PDF&#039;s, there are two options eliminated. Using a Live CD or a non-partioned encrypted USB stick to access SR will eliminate the bootkit trojan being physically installed as they don&#039;t have a MBR and should never be left behind when not in use, thus eliminating access to them by LE. The Stoned Bootkit will only work when a user is operating from an encrypted HDD installed on their PC, which is not something anyone with any brains would ever do, especially a vendor. Even then, some basic mistakes would still have to be made for the bootkit to work.<br />If you stick to some basic fundamentals, this bootkit should never come into play, especially for those smarter users who operate from a laptop with NO HDD installed and run a live CD to access Tor and SR. :P<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				If they took your laptop and you had tor closed, could they still get into your SR account somehow?

				It depends. If they were to seize it immediately after you shut down Tor, your passwords could be extracted from your RAM. This is based on a very short time frame after the PC is shut down from memory. They could launch a brute force or dictionary attack in the hope of uncovering your passwords which is why your password strength from the get go is SO IMPORTANT. Your passwords could be easily seen if LE were able to install a key-stroke logger on your keyboard or PC, which would log and then send your key strokes to the attacker, uncovering a wealth of information such as passwords, personal information and even back account login&#039;s and PIN numbers. This could all be made much tougher for LE if encryption was used on your drive (not 100% secure by any means) or better still, a Live-CD or encrypted USB flash drive was used to run Tor off (better option than an encrypted HDD).
