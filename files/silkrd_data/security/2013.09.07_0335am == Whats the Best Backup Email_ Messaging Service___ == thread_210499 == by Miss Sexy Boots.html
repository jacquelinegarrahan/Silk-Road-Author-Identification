				Now that TORMAIL is dead what do the experts recommend for secure back up email/ messaging and communications?<br /><br />I am still pretty shocked to see that most vendors have not updated back up communication address or their GPG/ PGP Keys (Which include their old dirty Tormail addresses).<br /><br />As TORMAIL completely fell over I thought that the first and the smartest business decision any prudent vendor would make would be to set in place back up plans in case the same fate became of SR. If I were a business owner I would have scrambled to set up redundancy so that I could stay in business regardless... but few seem to care, and even fewer have implemented such back up communication strategies.<br /><br /><br />I have looked into:<br /><br />Safe-mail.net - But it seems to be pitiful. A bit like playing on an early 90&#039;s battery powered hand held LED toy.<br /><br />Countermail.com - But it required full on Java, which is exactly what I am told we need to avoid like to plague on our browsers. I have failed when trying to upgrade the java applet on multiple computers and worry that this level of exposure is a potential ticking time bomb.<br /><br /><br />Any input regarding this topic/ conversation is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Bootzy... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If you wan make sure e-mail provider stay around then use yahoo or hotmail and mandate PGP only communications 100% of time and never log in outside of Tor.<br /><br />All other e-mail provide not any more secure then that really. maybe nsa does not have auto-back door into them but security is false there just like on tormail, if you don use PGP it is not safe.<br />

You can still use countermail without having to run Java. Just sign up and configure your email client to point to countermails mail server. I know a few people that use it and it seems legit for now. They also offer encryption built in but again we should never rely on third party encryption as it can never truly be trusted. Probably a safe bet would be a vpn, sign up for a fresh email account anywhere and use encryption for all your communications.

				Have been very curious for more information on what happen to Tormail. All the talk on main site of backups multi servers etc. The domain web server never went down but nothing else as we all know. Tormail domain no seized so theory can be put back up. Interest that nobody have some better information on that.

				http://bitmailendavkbec.onion/<br />Bitmessage Mail Gateway<br /><br />That&#039;s by far the best out there right now. You setup an account then use Thunderbird with Torbirdy to access your account via the same onion address above (check both your pop and smtp settings to make sure only the onion address is in there). Install Enigmail to work with GPG and Thunderbird to encrypt all your messages. It&#039;s stupid simple and you won&#039;t ever get fucked accessing your account without Tor.<br /><br />http://torbox3uiot6wchz.onion/<br />TorBox<br /><br />That second site looks really cool but I haven&#039;t been able to access my accounts after setting them up. Tried repeatedly over several days and both accounts failed. Fuck that&nbsp; &gt;:( Speak up if you have more luck with it.

Like it a lot. <br /><br />Your set up sounds pretty solid and I am going to give it a go. <br /><br />Question: Would it be wise to run Thunderbird from inside a VM like Whonix, which is in turn inside a Truecrypt folder? And if so, how does one choose for the messages to be stored in a file in the encrypted folder? (As opposed to having Thunderbird choose to store them in a regular unencrypted folder on my HD.<br /><br />Cheers Guys! <br /><br />

				Look out for Bitmessage. There&#039;s a serious flaw in their protocol. Search the boards for more info. On a side note what about signing up for any email provider like yahoo for example over Tor then use Pidgeon IM with Off the Record plugin. That&#039;s the IM app that comes with Tail. What you could do is add your contacts there, encrypt your message then send it to them. Basically like email but your getting double encryption and also the source and destination of said message is discarded or not traceable back to you once the session is over according to documentation. Again I haven&#039;t used that service but I presume it&#039;s legit as it&#039;s included in Tails. Any thoughts?
