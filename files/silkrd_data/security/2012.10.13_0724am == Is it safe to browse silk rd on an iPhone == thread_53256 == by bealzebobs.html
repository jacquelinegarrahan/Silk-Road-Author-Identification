Especially not if you want to hide your tor usage. Downloading the app itself leaves a trail linked to your account/phone.<br /><br />Its also vunerable in a few other specific instances. checkout *clearnet* onionbrowser.com

Safe as in, nobody will ever be able to tell you browsed tor and had onion browser installed? no. Unless you build and install that yourself, or&nbsp; use another non appstore method to install, you will leave a digital trail showing that yuo downloaded it.<br /><br />From there, actually using the browser to browse secure -- as long as you&#039;re just casually browsing , you should be fine. The moment you start doing anything that relates to sensitive info, you should not use your iOS based OnionBrowser. Many reasons , but&nbsp; the fact that its a location sensitive device in itself makes it less than ideal for anything more than casually browsing. <br />

This being said simply browsing should be fine but any info you submit (usernames, passwords, emails) could, with enough effort, be intercepted.

				I certainly wouldn&#039;t consider it safe. IIRC there was a log kept in the older phones (possibly still there?) of all the iphone&#039;s keystrokes. I attempted to find a relevant source for this, but couldn&#039;t so take it with a grain of salt. Either way, stick to browsing at home where there are less likely to be prying eyes around.<br /><br />Be safe.

				PARANOIA, is a good thing, I have just deleted onion browser from my iphone they are way too easy to track, I don&#039;t trust how Technological advanced they are. Or even communicating via FB. Get a crap phone under a fake name. <br /><br /><br />Use a USB stick to run onion of your pc.<br /><br />Better to be safe then incarcerated.

				As far as I can see, and agreeing with majority of previous posters, running Tor app on an iphone or android OS won&#039;t identify which websites you&#039;re on, just that your using Tor.&nbsp; And depending on connection/location you may find that Tor&#039;s bootstrapping process gets stuck at 80+%.&nbsp; Dunno if this is a conscious effort by mobile internet providers to try and prevent people from accessing Tor-only sites, or just variations depending on signal, however a majority of smartphones also use GPS, unless you have this feature turned off when accessing Tor/SR/Forum, so your location can likely be easily tracked via satellite if this was intended.&nbsp; But now its all getting a bit tinfoil hat time - sure we all need to have a degree of paranoia when dealing with SR, but it&#039;s unlikely anyone&#039;s gonna be interested in trying to track your browsing history on your mobile phone, and as this is sensitive, personal data, it is protected under data protection legislation whichever country you live in.&nbsp; You will likely have some antivirus software on your phone - make sure you are opted out of even the anonymous statistical collation of attacks/sites etc, particularly as some antivirus throws up Tor as a suspicious object - because it is used by &quot;criminals&quot; or some such shit - but I would say browse only.&nbsp; For anyone who&#039;s monitoring internet use, using Tor is only indicative of privacy in the first instance.&nbsp; Keep your orders to PCs where you can use PGP encryption for addresses etc.

				Technical aspects and &#039;safety&#039; aside - Silk Road does not work on either Tor Browser available for the iPhone (Covert Browser, Onion Browser). So... moot point.<br />.Hades.
