				Fileape and mediafire have both removed the download already.<br /><br />Tor is available and works on a jb phone, but you have to be connected to a wireless connection because that&#039;s the only way you can give it the http proxy settings. I&#039;ve used this in a pinch before, but I also turn off everything else that&#039;s running and I turn off the 3g/data while using tor to ensure that I&#039;m only going through that one pipe.

				This looks great, but I&#039;m not well-versed in network security or iPhone apps: does this provide the same level of security as Tor on a computer device? Are there any PGP solutions for the iPhone?

				The browser itself is craptacular given what we&#039;re used to from just about any browser offered on the iphone. I don&#039;t think this version of the browser will ever work for an SR site since the browser doesn&#039;t appear to support cookies. Which is ok really, since you wouldn&#039;t be able to read any of the SR site text because of how it renders pages and zooming doesn&#039;t actually result in a better rendering of the page, just a larger version of the same rendered image.<br /><br />If you&#039;re serious about SR from an iPhone, you currently have two choices... well one choice since web-based tor proxies are a bad idea. Search for and install the .deb for the sid77.slackware.it repository (I didn&#039;t have any luck entering repo data manually, just download the deb to your phone and use dpkg in a terminal to install it). That repo will let you use Cydia to put tor, a lightweight proxy and a couple other useful goodies onto your phone (like tor-toggle). Once its installed, getting onto the darknet is a two step process that requires a wifi connection: <br />1) Use the tor-toggle to turn on tor and the proxy on<br />2) Settings -&gt; WiFi -&gt; (whatever-wifi-you&#039;re-on) -&gt; HTTP Proxy -&gt; Manual<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the proxy, set it to host: 127.0.0.1 port: 8118<br />Fire up Safari and profit! (Note: you can use other browsers if you want, just not Opera)<br /><br />I think there may be sneakier ways to do this as well, I&#039;m still digging around out of curiosity, but it will all essentially be some version of the above.<br /><br />When I do this, I wish I could have the phone in airplane mode + wifi, so I use the SB settings to turn off 3G, Data. Also, I only ever actually access the SR site for emergencies like this (I did it once to finalize an order that would have otherwise sat around for 4-5 days). I have not done an actual security review to ensure the water-tightness of this set up. Things like push notifications might still be in play, I&#039;m not sure.

				Sorry to resurrect this thread but i just got the new iPad and installed covert browser.<br /><br />I can get to the login area, log in and it goes to a blank screen that says finished...<br /><br />What gives.<br /><br />My other plan was even sneakier....I have a small IT company with remote access to a few corporate servers, was thinking about getting some sort of remote desktop app and accessing said server and logging into SR from there.<br /><br /><br />Then it would be as close to anonymous as it gets, no?

				I wouldn&#039;t fuck with any Iphone apps if I were you.<br /><br />You are more in control over your own Internet connection than you are of your Ipone, whether it&#039;s a WiFi or a data plan. WiFi can be hacked pretty easy, and it seems like Apple and whoever provides your cell phone plan would have access to the things that you are looking at.<br /><br />There&#039;s also the whole scenario of getting busted for something and have the cops find your phone with a record of your Silk Road purchases...<br /><br />I say keep it on a land computer with some good quality firewalls, and don&#039;t fuck with the Iphone stuff.<br /><br />

Also, instead of Safari, use something like Dolphin browser and only use it with onion addresses (bonus points for configuring Firewall to only ever allow it to use .onion addresses) and set it for privacy mode so that nothing is stored on the phone (yeah, I should probably put &#039;nothing&#039; in quotes... it&#039;ll at least be less than safari&#039;s idea of nothing).<br /><br />At best, Apple and the phone carrier will only be able to tell that you&#039;re using tor on your phone, which itself might stand out as completely unusual, but there you are.<br /><br />I wanted to add another step to my earlier recipe for the technologically gifted, it&#039;s possible to tweak the phone data connection settings by hand to enable &quot;auto&quot; proxy and point it at your own proxy.pac on your phone. Then it just takes a couple rules in it to correctly channel clearnet and proxy onion traffic based on the URL. Though, this makes onion surfing almost too easy.<br /><br />Even though I trust such a setup about as much as I trust anything else that accesses SR, this came about from a time that needed something drastic in order to finalize a purchase that otherwise would have sat around for a number of days.<br /><br />On CoverBrowser, the version that I tried out didn&#039;t support cookies so I don&#039;t think it could ever really access SR, at least that was my experience with it at the time.<br />

				I don&#039;t see any problem using tor/accessing sr via phone. I use a prepaid android phone(not under any name) with orbot/orweb and it usually works better/faster than vidalia bundle. I pgp encrypt any sensitive info offline on a laptop save as txt transfer to phone then copy/paste.sure its not &quot;industry standard&quot; security but I feel more @ ease accessing sr using this prepaid phone thru 3g or hacked wifi than I do on a laptop...just my .02BTC on using tor/accessing sr via phone
