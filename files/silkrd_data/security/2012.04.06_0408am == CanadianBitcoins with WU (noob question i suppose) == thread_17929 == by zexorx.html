				If I get bitcoins from CanadianBitcoins.com through a WU money transfer, provide a fake name and a phone number for a prepaid phone that cant be traced to me in any way, and then have canadianbitcoins transfer the bitcoins to my desktop based wallet and then transfer them from there to SR, is there anyway the bitcoins can be traced to me?? Look im a complete begginer if theres info out there already regarding this stuff please redirect me to it. Thanks alot:)

				It&#039;s better not to use fake names and such when buying bitcoins, as you could fuck up something and it looks suspicious. Remember bitcoins are not illegal. As long as you aren&#039;t directly paying SR (wouldn&#039;t really matter if you were anyways as a buyer) and at least send it to another address before sending it to here you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in montreal, there&#039;s a guy who sells for cash there on bitcointalk.org<br /><br />

				cavirtex does direct cash deposits<br />there&#039;s also a bitcoin 2 cash site that accepts money orders and cash in mail in Toronto, they&#039;re on the bitcoin wiki under Trade forgot the name<br /><br />If you&#039;re worried don&#039;t be. There are countless, countless clearnet sites in Canada openly selling drugs that accept cash by mail and they&#039;ve been operating for years.

				cavirtex is definitely the best exchange for Canadian&#039;s, the options they have for funding is free or very cheap compared to wire transfers. I use hyper wallet to fund my VirtEx account.<br /><br />Also I must add if you&#039;re just a buyer of personal amounts, and not a seller, there is really no reason to even bother hiding your identity on a bitcoin site. Trading bitcoins is legal, and there is an extremely low chance that any LE would spend any amount of time trying to trace your BTC. Investigations (especially in Canada, where we don&#039;t have a DEA) are reserved for more substantial crimes. When it comes down to it, Canada does not compare in any way whatsoever to the protocols of the US and the DEA (investigations generally begin to occur when the charge is at above possession for trafficking).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been arrested for a worse thing, and even my lawyer assured me that an investigation wouldn&#039;t happen because of the unsubstantial nature of the crime. You still should be careful as a general rule when traveling on the Road, but the bitcoin trading will almost definitely not be investigated in any way.

				Is it standard practice for them to ask for ID when making a cash deposit? I&#039;ve made 2 in-person cash deposits since I joined SR and was asked to provide ID on my first visit to RBC. Since I&#039;ve never made a deposit into someone else&#039; account before, I figured it was just standard to provide ID. Without really thinking about it and not wanting to look suspicious I provided them with my ID. After filling out the slip, counting the money and typing a few things into the computer, I was told that she needed to get a supervisors approval since it was a third party deposit. I started getting a bit nervous at this point but figured I really have nothing to worry about since I&#039;m just buying Bitcoins and I haven&#039;t made any SR purchases at this point so haven&#039;t done anything illegal. After this I didn&#039;t think anything of it until I went back a second time (ended up getting the same teller) and wasn&#039;t asked for ID or had to wait for a supervisor to approve the transaction. Should I be worried/paranoid that something is up?

				@Squidy: I can&#039;t remember where, but I read somewhere about a guy who was worried about being asked for ID, and said that he/she left their wallet at home and they put the transaction through anyways. You could always say you don&#039;t have your wallet and try again the next day.

				That&#039;s what I plan on doing next time they ask me for ID, I&#039;ll also start going to different branches to my deposits. Just a little worried that they already have my ID from the first transaction, though I&#039;m not too worried since it&#039;s Canada and they probably don&#039;t have the resources to go after someone that&#039;s buying personal amounts.

				Thanks for the info, SusAsFuck,<br /><br />That sucks, hyperwallet should&#039;ve been protecting their commercial clients, fucking piece of shit business. I wonder what the scam was considering the nature of the system is hard CASH based. Sounds like hyperwallet is to blame for this one. One reason for this being that hyperwallet obviously made it more convenient for VirtEx customers to use their (VirtEx) service. <br /><br />I&#039;m not affected by this anymore though, because I decided to do cash RBC deposits from now on. Hyperwallet can stick their $1 transfer fee up their asses and shit it out when they go bankrupt for sucking.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Does suck for everyone who does rely on that though. Maybe cash deposits or ID verification is the way to go now. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be negatively affected in ID&#039;ing yourself; VirtEx is just making sure they can verify whose money is in your account, to prevent monetary scamming and false account/asset claims, and of course banking laws. Exchange companies only care about money, not what your doing with it. Us buying illegal shit makes them &quot;drug money&quot; anyway.<br /><br />If you are paranoid about your identification, the cash deposit at RBC is probably your safest bet though, because even when ID is presented it is less detailed.<br />

				Since canadianbitcoins no longer takes EMT you&#039;ll notice bitcointalk.org currency exchange base is filling up with users doing EMT to each other, so still an option. Just be careful you only deal with reliable members as EMT can be charged back if you are selling.<br /><br />Seems like Canadians doing more cash in person transactions too.<br />Whatever city you live in make a thread you want to buy/sell with cash (on bitcointalk.. not here)<br /><br />

Gox. Always refer to the site for the weighted average (which dictates the value of the bitcoin on SR and i general as it has the highest trade volumes of any exchange by a long shot). You&#039;ll notice that BTC are a bit cheaper at VirtEx, usually lagging behind the Mt.G rate around 5% (after USD-CAD conversion is factored).<br /><br />Also what you may have&nbsp; noticed is that the Mt.Gox market for CAD trades at a very low volume and can be 10% or more expensive than the USD market. Basically if you want to buy BTC with Canadian Dollars, Mt.Gox is the grocery store after wide-spread speculation of an apocolypse. The shelves are pretty much empty.<br /><br />Now you want to remain anonymous. Although I didn&#039;t chose this route (the exchange of BTC to CAD is the red flag for the CRA to do a thorough audit of your income), I can certainly help you.<br /><br />VirtEx (cavirtex.com) allows you to anonymously deposit cash at 3 different banks (RBC, BMO, and I believe Scotia) with no account verification necessary. This used to be free, however, they implemented a $3 fee for each deposit. (The fee is deducted from the amount you deposit). Earlier in this thread there is mention of this being done and concern over ID being required. ID is not required (at least from my experience at RBC), and those who requested ID were likely unfamiliar with direct cash deposits and wanted someone&#039;s ID on file to hold accountable in case the cash went missing or some crazy shit. So deposit as much cash as possible when you deposit to avoid a stack of $3 fees&nbsp; (not to mention the trip to the bank that might make you uncomfortable if you are paranoid about your anonymity). There will, of course, be a limit to your deposit amount and transaction activity should you remain unverified (verification requires several pieces of ID, in compliance with Canada&#039;s banking laws).<br /><br />From here there are many guides you can follow now that you&#039;ve got you bitcoins. (for example: Send to your bitcoin wallet, tumble them through a few instawallet transactions, possibly splitting the transfer amounts, then finally transferring the funds to SR either directly or from various sources in variable amounts.)<br /><br />You&#039;re set!<br /><br />Or the fast and easy way: deposit funds to VirtEx account, buy bitcoins, withdraw directly to SR and buy your premium coffee and loose leaf tea. And you&#039;re done! <br /><br />When you receive your tea, sit back, relax and reflect on the hard wok you put into sourcing such decadent tea leaves. Or if it was coffee, brew some beans, and enjoy whatever edge such premium coffee can&nbsp; give you.<br /><br />Feel free to PM me for any sensitive questions. Otherwise you can reply here so others can search for the information, should they need it at a later time.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Regi
