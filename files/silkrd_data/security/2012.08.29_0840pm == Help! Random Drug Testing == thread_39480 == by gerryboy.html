				Hey there,<br /><br />Looking for some advice regarding random drug testing my work will be introducing next month.<br /><br />A percentage of the workforce will be randomly tested each year for drugs.<br /><br />I indulge in a smoke most nights (not alot usually a small joint of hash) and a few more over the weekend. <br /><br />Does anyone have any advice how to pass a random test? I have been looking at synthetic urines on the internet which seem to be the best bet. I can&#039;t exactly afford to lose my job but my smoking and other vices do not affect my ability to carry out my job as I&#039;m never under the influence when I&#039;m at work unlike some of the booze bags who I work with.<br /><br />The issue I have with the synthetic urine is getting it to the appropriate temperature.<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated! I don&#039;t like the idea of my personal preferences and life being dictated by my work.

				I have known some people in the same position as you. They were able to utilize a kit sold by some synthetic urine company. They kept it with their lunch or what not. It had an elastic band to attach to your inner thigh and a heat pack to warm up the urine. Worked for them and they operated some expensive machinery, stoned all day.<br /><br />Generally when you get notice your company sends you to the lab and you take your own personal vehicle. Once at the lab they don&#039;t allow you in the room with jackets, or clothing that would allow for easy concealment. They may have you empty your pockets, especially if they look full of something. They don&#039;t watch, and they don&#039;t make you take your pants off or anything. They dye the water and usually the sink doesn&#039;t work. Should be easy-peasy. Get an at home drug test to reassure yourself by doing your own test once.

				I say you should try to find a new job, while you&#039;re at it. If you don&#039;t fuck up, they have no reason to be doing those tests, except as an attempt to catch drug-users so they have a reason to fire them without unemployment benefits. Saves the company money, that does. (Fuckers...)

				Motherfuckers.&nbsp; You can lose your job for smoking the odd spliff of a night. I hate prohibition of all drugs but cannabis is the one that makes my blood boil. HOW THE FUCK CAN IT BE ILLEGAL!<br /><br />I suppose you&#039;ll have to start smoking heroin instead. It&#039;s a much better high and it only shows up in urine for a week at the absolute max , unlike the month or so for cannabis.

				Don&#039;t smoke heroin, smoke something a little harder to detect... can extracted psilocybin vaporize? Anyone know? :D<br /><br />Maybe some DMT, instead?

				Its the fact i have smoked the whole time during my eployment and it wasnt an issue when the times were good (i estimate about 30% of the workforce take some sort of drug) but now that work is slowly drying up they are looking at ways to fire folk without paying them their dues and this isnt some small local company its a billion dollar one so its fucking pocket change to them.<br /><br />My smoking doesnt affect my work in anyway at all, i have a small spliff every other nighy through the week and i smoke a few each day at the weekend. all of this is done in the privacy of my own home, in my own time it really isnt&nbsp; my works concern but if its saving big business money well....<br /><br />

				You&#039;re right, it isn&#039;t their concern. It&#039;s bullshit that you can get fired for this and I hope you don&#039;t. I wish you all the luck in the world for acquiring some clean/fake urine. As I said earlier, you should start trying to find a new job as well. You get that, you don&#039;t have a problem. Though, might have to stop smoking for that part, too. Lose-lose no matter what you do, sorry man.

				IF they are doing it next month, and only once a year, your safe bet would be to just take a break from blazing. I have taken drug tests where I am alone, watched head on, and watched from the door (was a minor) I had a buddy that was on papers and he gave me his piss, i put it in a plastic somewhat flat bottle and put it under my balls, if you keep it there for the ride and stuff it will warm up a bit with no help, in the private setting i still acted like i was taking a piss just in case i got walked in on and was pouring piss on the cup on the counter.<br /><br />Best bet is take the month if IF they are only doing it next month and once a year, better then loosing your job and after the drug test if you are selected you will get high as fuck!
