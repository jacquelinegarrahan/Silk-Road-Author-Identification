				My main question (Australia) is if anyone has any information or common knowledge or even speculation (which will be what most answers will be) of how LE in Australia is currently handling the SR situation and perhaps more importantly what mistakes new vendors make which could get them caught?<br /><br />Also did ETM get caught or just do a runner or on a break?

				Ok, thanks for your replys :) The vendor I am talking about does everything perfectly as far as I am aware. The only way they would get caught is if LE was posing as a buyer and bought product, tracked where it came from through the tracking number via express post (the number is not given out at purchase but is still on the package on arrival), get the time stamp, look at the camera&#039;s, get their face, run it through face recognition software and walaa! you have enough to put them away for a long time?<br /><br />But if LE are not posing as SR buyers then there is nothing to worry about for them I imagine.<br /><br />Also, is there a place where I can find a list of illegal substances in Australia? beacuse the&nbsp; only information I can find is that NBOMe (tabs I am buying from them) is illegal in South Australia but what about the rest of Australia?<br /><br />I am actually very surprised to not find a thread on these forums, as a guideline for new vendor to not get caught?<br /><br />And also what the hell happened to ETM?<br />

				The PM annouced today that she will set up a $64M, 70 person, AFP Taskforce to battle gun and drug sales over state borders and entering into the country. <br />Setting up offices in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane with liaison Officers in the other capitals.<br /><br />Although she didn&#039;t talk about SR directly, it definitely sounds like it. They are also about to pass/ed a bill, that will allow the AFP to directly monitor all internet traffic going in to and out of Australia without having to apply for a federal warrant first, which will come into effect by the end 2013. <br /><br />&nbsp;(I believe they try and keep SR out of the media as much as possible, because it creates interest in the public) <br />I won&#039;t post the article here because I don&#039;t want to go onto the clearnet site, but it hit the digital press and late news a few hours ago.<br /><br />I doubt it was ETM that lost the 530Kg of Ice to Customs on Friday from China.&nbsp; :o :o Now that gotta hurt.

				If Australia filters Internet traffic in and out of the country then everybody using Tor will automatically become flagged.&nbsp; Using tor creates a recognizable signature on a network,&nbsp; Basically you can tell that you&#039;re using a tour browser.&nbsp; Although there&#039;s nothing illegal about this it will at least give authorities a short list to work from.<br /><br />This creates an awesome business opportunity.&nbsp; Selling VPN accounts to Australians!!&nbsp; &nbsp;VPN is the solution to this problem.&nbsp; There are plenty of VPN services out there and I think many SR users should consider using them or falling back onto them. <br /><br />Australia is like an aquarium filled with people.&nbsp; It&#039;s under such control and easy to control.&nbsp; Domestic vendors will do great there .<br /><br /><br />

				Good post. <br /><br /><br />I hte to divert, but it probably applies here under the packaging, etc. What do VENDORS think of hand-written shipping labels on Express? Bad idea? Reason for possibly flagging?&nbsp; This would be GREAT to know.

				1 possible way they could be tracking sr deliveries is too pose as a buyer and fingerprint the inside of all express post satchels....the vac seal bags.....majority of online dealers will have a print on file for something<br />lesson in this always use gloves and get someone else to drop it off at the post office

				I honestly don&#039;t know how many vendors on here get caught from their activities on SR.&nbsp; If anything they are probably getting busted IRL because they are selling IRL.&nbsp; If they are doing everything correctly (eg changing parcel appearance occasionally, posting fake return addresses and changes those occasionally, using good stealth, etc) then I doubt there&#039;s much of a chance of them getting busted from their activities on SR.<br /><br />Maybe some have gotten busted when the cops entered their house for other reasons.&nbsp; If, as a buyer on SR, I were to get busted I feel I would have very little recourse or ability to snitch on my vendor.&nbsp; I have almost zero information to go on.&nbsp; And I&#039;m perfectly fine with that.

				Well, ETM disappeared with orders outstanding. Maybe he was picked up. Maybe he did a runner.<br /><br />But if he were picked up, I would strongly expect either:<br /><br />1) a huge deal of parading him before the press as an important win against the drug trade and SR in particular, OR<br />2) a very quick return to business as usual as LE assumes his account and starts reeling in the info<br /><br />A sudden, extended absence and no claims of victory from LE? My bet is he took the coins and split.

				No no, it was obvious ETM was a scammer BECAUSE -<br /><br />In the week prior to him leaving he created his first &quot;SALE&quot; where he required you to FE for the sale items<br /><br />What&#039;s the chance he just happened to set that up the same week he goes missing with all moneyz?<br /><br />Also I think he changed his page to say something like &quot;It&#039;s a game and you all got played&quot; or something to that effect
