				So this is the first time I&#039;m using BitInstant since they took away the bank option. Today I went to BitInstant and filled out and printed the form like I was supposed to. I went to CVS to do the MoneyGram thing and they kept saying that there was some error with my last name. So I just left and went back home thinking that maybe because I used a fake name it was saying that. I re-did the form with my real name but this time I went to WalMart. The same thing happened. They were telling me that the account number is right but my last name was wrong. What do I do? I need to order supplies by this weekend. Any help is appreciated!!

				i just deposited with bitinstant for the first time today...picked up the phone they told me to go t the desk..i did and gave them the amount i was sending..said they didn&#039;t have the transation. turns out they were looking up my order as if i was sending it to a person rather than paying a bill which is what you want to tell them. try telling them you&#039;re paying a bill through moneygram...they might be selecting the wrong menu to search for the order...

				Same exact issue here -- I went to a grocery store, stated all the false info into the red phone, and was told that my last name was incorrect. I KNOW it wasn&#039;t incorrect, because I had everything written down in front of me.<br /><br />The paranoid side of me is wondering if they&#039;re verifying phone numbers and addresses now, and instead of being straight-up about that, they&#039;re simply denying &quot;illegitimate&quot; moneygrams with a blanket excuse -- &quot;your last name is incorrect.&quot; The whole thing seems kind of&nbsp; weird to me. Hopefully it gets cleared up soon.

				I had the same thing happen yesterday afternoon and later in the evening. Both times I used false names and both times I was told that the last name was wrong. Ended up spending an additional $40 over what I was going to spend on a Moneypak and had to pay 14% instead of BitInstant&#039;s 3.99% fee. I am so tired of the difficulties with trying to get Bitcoin, it shouldn&#039;t be this hard.

				this is interesting, I bought coins about 3 days ago, used fake info for the bitinstant form (since they changed it to require this since last time), and then when I paid zz through moneygram, I used my real info as it&#039;s saved in the moneygram system. I didn&#039;t have any problems getting my coins through

				I just ran into the same problem an hour ago and was super sketched out about it, but I&#039;m glad to see that I&#039;m not alone. I just told the rep. on the phone that I&#039;d go home and retry. Now when I go to bitinstant they don&#039;t even have the CVS, 7/11, or Walmart deposit options anymore?! Anyone know what&#039;s going on? I really hope they fix this soon, because I was hoping to put and order in tonight. But this is just my luck :-\

				I might try to buy BTC from a SR vendor for the first time...<br /><br />Sugar Mama &amp; Captain Mal both sell BTC and both have perfectly impeccable reps. Both have minimums:&nbsp; <br /><br />Sugar Mama&#039;s site says $300 minimum via Money Gram or Western Union<br /><br />CaptainMal&#039;s site says $100 minimum by Western Union&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope it&#039;s okay to be posting something like this as I&#039;m just trying to help other members with options during the Bitinstant screw-up.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are other vendors, these are two that I know about and have researched and would be comfortable buying from. <br /><br />Cheers&nbsp; :-*<br />&nbsp;

				The cash deposit option is back up on Bitinstant, and it looks like all is well again.<br /><br />Still, I can&#039;t help but feel like the days of cash deposits for BTC are going to come to an end some day.

				CVS employees often ask for ID. It&#039;s hard to say how often, because you probably only hear about it on here when they do, but still, I won&#039;t mess with CVS for that reason. I&#039;ve never read about anyone being asked for ID at Walmart, just make sure you&#039;ve got your fake info memorized.
