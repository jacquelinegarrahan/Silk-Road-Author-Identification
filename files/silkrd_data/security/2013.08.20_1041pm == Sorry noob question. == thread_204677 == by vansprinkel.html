				Hi, I&#039;m completely new to linux and gpg and sr. I got tails running on a USB stick and I&#039;m trying to learn how to use gpg encrypted messages and the whatnot. I&#039;ve read through the manual and a couple different beginner tutorials on reddit as well as the unbuntu forums. But I can&#039;t seem to get it working, I&#039;m kinda stumped.<br /><br />Do I need to give people my public key before I can send and recieve encrypted messages with them? I figure that must be because otherwise I can&#039;t figure it out.<br /><br />All of the commands I&#039;m supposed to use don&#039;t seem to work correctly like I have the keys and the messages downloaded in the proper formats it looks like but the terminal just won&#039;t cooperate. Does anybody have any advice or know of any resources for completely retarded people they could pass my way?<br /><br />ALl your halp is appreciated. Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*

				If you don&#039;t know how to use PGP then head to the noob section and practice in the Newbie PGP Club thread.<br /><br />Yes you must have another person&#039;s public key to encrypt a message for them. And they must have YOUR public key to encrypt a message for you.<br /><br />Practice, practice, practice! You don&#039;t want to get this shit wrong when it counts.

There is a gedit plugin that will allow you to encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify from right within the editor. This makes it a joy to use. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />
