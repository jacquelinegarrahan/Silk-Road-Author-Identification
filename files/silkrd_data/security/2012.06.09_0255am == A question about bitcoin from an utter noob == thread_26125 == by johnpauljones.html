				Hey everyone, so I&#039;m really interested in using Silk Road, but I&#039;ve never dealt with bitcoins before, and it seems rather confusing.&nbsp; I went to try to buy some at the Bitcoin website, but from there I was directed to MtGox.&nbsp; I thought I could buy some bitcoins there, but then I was directed to a site like Liberty Reserve, and from there to yet another site.&nbsp; I stopped after that, and so I&#039;m not sure if I had to take more steps.&nbsp; It seems like if I eventually find a way to buy bitcoins, I&#039;ll have to funnel it back through this multitude of websites to finally get it to Silk Road.&nbsp; It all seems so confusing and unnecessary.&nbsp; Is this how buying bitcoins is usually done?&nbsp; Is there an easier way?&nbsp; Please help!

				Im relieved to know that I am not the only one having trouble with this process. I am having such a difficult time while&nbsp; attempting to purchase bitcoins and at the same time Im looking over SR and noticing how tough it appears for newcomers to buy from many of the best sellers. I was so excited when my friend told me about the whole TOR Project and SR and now that Im in it all still feels so inaccessible.<br /><br />I noticed that 21 ppl before me read JPJ&#039;s original post here and none have responded, and as with most internet forums Im sure someone cant wait to rail me for some type of inappropriate conduct here for my first post; wrong forum for this post, you didnt read the 75 page instruction sticky in the Read This First post, youre a bitch figure it out... I never know what to expect but if anyone has the patience and the heart to help a good guy out Id be very grateful. <br />

				It is never easy to get started with something new. Try to check the bitcoin wiki-page (especially this page: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins). Depending on where you live there are different ways to anonymously buy bitcoins. The wiki-page gives you a good start to find an exchanger for buying bitcoins. <br /><br />In general the way is the following: Depositing fiat money (Dollar, Euro, etc.) into the exchangers. Buying bitcoins. Sending the bitcoins out of the exchangers e-wallet into your own or other e-wallets like easywallet.org. Then either mix the bitcoins for stronger anonymity or sending it to you silkroad wallet address which you find in your silkroad account.<br /><br />Hope this helps you to get started.

				Hi JP,<br /><br />Welcome to SR!<br /><br />It can be a bit tricky at first.<br /><br />The short answer is that there is no single best way to buy Bitcoins. The more mainstream methods such as signing up to MtGox and funding your account via another e-currency provider named Dwolla is probably the easiest if you live in the US however it is also the most traceable. You really want to be able to buy Bitcoins in a safe way so that no one can trace the passage of your coins through the Bitcoin block chain.<br /><br />If you live in the UK or Europe, I run a service selling Bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail. If you&#039;re in the US I suggest you look up BlueSkyTraders on here who will sell you Bitcoins for MoneyPaks which I understand you can buy for cash in most retail stores in the US.<br /><br />You&#039;ll find the SR community are very welcoming but there is a lot to take in and sometimes the same questions are posted and answered over and over again. You could do worse than have a read of the posts already in the Security section and also use the search bar to see if someone hasn&#039;t already answered your queries.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				A lot of my customers seem to be having luck with coinapult.com lately.&nbsp; It is not foolproof but is pretty straightforward for new people.&nbsp; You really need to get the concept that bitcoins are stored in a wallet before you do anything else.&nbsp; In fact, the very first step before anything is to go to blockchain.info and sign up so you have a wallet.&nbsp; If you have no wallet, you have no place to store bitcoins because they won&#039;t live in your pockets.&nbsp; LOL.<br /><br />So get a wallet at blockchain.info, and if you want to make a new receiving address and call it &quot;from flaxceed&quot;.&nbsp; If you do that, and reply here on this thread, i will send you a tiny amount of bitcoins.&nbsp; This gets you on your way because you are getting a feel for it.&nbsp; All the n00bs on this thread can talk to each other and send bitcoins back and forth- it is fun and easy once you have done it a couple of times.&nbsp; Just make a new receiving address for each one.&nbsp; You can only learn this thing by doing it.&nbsp; Ask questions if you get stuck.<br /><br />Remember, make a new receiving address for each transaction that involves bitcoins coming to you.&nbsp; On blockchain.info, there is a little blue icon to the left of your new receiving address that allows you to label that address.&nbsp; Get used to doing that.&nbsp; You need to know where the bitcoins came from to keep your transactions clear in your head.<br /><br />Sometimes threads like this don&#039;t get far, and I think it is because once people jump in and do it, they don&#039;t need very much guidance any more.&nbsp; But, I check the forums at least once a day and if anyone is stuck, or wants me to send a little fraction of a bitcoin to their brand new wallet, no worries.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best of luck, and welcome to this brave new world.&nbsp; You are free now- what will you do with this freedom?<br /><br />flax

				IN reality... I still don&#039;t how fucking bit coin works, but is anonymous if done correct<br /><br />dont worry about the chains and cryptic stuff.<br />just get a wallet (if your non just going to use your SR)<br /><br />Usually once a week I do $5.00 MPtoBTC exchanges. That would best way to get BTC.
