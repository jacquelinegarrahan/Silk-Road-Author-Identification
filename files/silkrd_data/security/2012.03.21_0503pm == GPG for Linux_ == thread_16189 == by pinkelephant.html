				I want to know how to install, however the gpg --gen-key seems working, but I can&#039;t figure out what is my public key, and I also want to use some graphic interface, like gpa, but i get an error message when i make it. Also i forgot my forum password, this not a good day for me&nbsp; :(

				I prefer KGPG,<br />Go into the terminal and enter the following commands (without quotes)<br /><br />&quot;sudo apt-get install kgpg&quot;<br /><br />Once it installs enter<br /><br />&quot;kgpg&quot; <br /><br />To launch the gui, I find its much easier to use than GPA.

				I belive I have libassuan, it need for gpg also and needed for the ./configure. Maybe the problem, that with libassuan 2.x the gpa configure hasn&#039;t worked, so I also installed libassuan 1.x.<br />I think I try kpgp, if it&#039;s that simple, for gpa, the sudo apt-get hasn&#039;t worked, maybe for this it will be okay. It seems for me, that even if I never do anything else in this page just learn to use it, I gain a lot of knowledge at least :)

				For kgpg I also got the error message for sudo apt-get install, which states: unable to locate package.<br /><br />So, I still don&#039;t know how to use pgp in linux. Maybe it&#039;s easier to use if I switch to windows, but I am using an old computer, which is very slow with windows, so I don&#039;t want to change my linux back to windows. So i followed the steps from this site: http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-2.html<br />but at the ./configure got me error message, fortunately with possible solution, so i downloaded and installed several other programs, one of them libassuan. After that, I belive that the installation was successful, at least gpg --gen-key seems working. But I don&#039;t know what is my public key, I never saw anything remotely similar than the keys I saw here. I thought that maybe if I put on a gui, it will be better. So I tried sudo apt-get gpa, which not worked. I downloaded the source and extracted form the tarball. I tried to ./configure, it hasn&#039;t worked, I downloaded GTK+, and some other programs, which the ./configure missed, so it seems working now. But when I try to continue with make, I got the error message, I described earlier. I never used linux from terminal, when I was a kid like 15 years ago, I used command line in dos, I try to use google, but seems I need some help other than that.

				I used to use gpg4usb, and it is pretty easy. but it doesn&#039;t have functionality for signed messages, and that is important to verify DPR messages about outages, etc.

				i guess you are right. I switched from it (due to the lack of signature functionality) right after the URL change signature debacle! looks like they did implement it shortly after that. so I withdraw my opposition to gpg4usb.
