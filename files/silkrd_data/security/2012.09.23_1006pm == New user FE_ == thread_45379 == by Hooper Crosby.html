				Title: <strong>New user FE?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I just placed my first order on SE this morning and was asked by the vendor to FE early since I was a new user.&nbsp; Before I placed the order, I reviewed the seller&#039;s home page and product page, and it didn&#039;t say anything about new users needing to FE.&nbsp; I realize it&#039;s a common practice on SR, but I would not have placed the order if I was required to FE.&nbsp; This particular seller has 179 transactions with a %99.7 seller rating.&nbsp; I placed 2 orders with this seller for a total order value of $120. I think i&#039;m going to propose that I FE one, and finalize the other on arrival.&nbsp; Is that fair?<br /><br />I think that just because I&#039;m a new user, doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t deserve any protection.&nbsp; What are some reasons why a legitimate vendor would require new users to FE?

				There are so many new buyers here that are placing orders and stating that they didn&#039;t get product and wanting replacements or trying to blackmail vendors about feedback . If you are uncomfortable you should be able to find a vendor that would not require FE. A vendor must have 35+ transactions before they could request FE from what I have read.&nbsp; I like your proposal but am not sure what the vendor would think and he has the right to refuse to sell to anyone. You could propose this to the vendor and if they dont want to just ask that they cancel you order

				I proposed this idea to the seller, but he didn&#039;t go for it.&nbsp; He said he will be refunding my order, but it&#039;s been 12 hours and no refund.&nbsp; Orders also are marked as &quot;in transit&quot;. Is this normal?<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious how many other vendors require new users to fe, even though it doesn&#039;t say anything about it in their seller profile, or product pages.&nbsp; Is this a common practice?&nbsp; He said I should have &quot;expected&quot; to fe.&nbsp; Anyone have any experience like this?<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to give the guy a bad review, because I am the new guy here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really have a baseline of experience to compare to.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really sure who is in the wrong.&nbsp; Me for not expecting to fe, or him for expecting me to expect to fe?&nbsp; :o

				Don&#039;t FE in my opinion. It sounds to me like you did the right thing. He has to mark your package &#039;in transit&#039; so that the finalize option becomes available to you. I doubt anything is actually in transit.<br /><br />If he refunds you then there is no reason to leave negative feedback. Sometimes things just need to be worked out with some communication.<br /><br />Find a vendor doing business like you want to do and give them your money. This way you help SR become more of the kind of place you want to shop.

I lurked for months before finally taking the plunge and watched the whole Tony76 thing unfold during that period, and swore that I would never FE. Today&#039;s trusted vendor is tomorrow&#039;s scammer. Escrow + DCN = both sides have protection. <br /><br />FE is like fucking a stranger without a condom...sure it sounds good, totally feels good, but HIV is forever and you have no way of knowing who&#039;s holding.

				Only finalize early what you are willing to lose. In my career on SR, I&#039;ve finalized early probably a dozen times, and been burnt three times. I was willing to lose my BTC on each transaction, and if I weren&#039;t, I would have chosen vendors that didn&#039;t require FE. <br /><br />If every dollar counts and you don&#039;t want to risk it, then by all means, never FE. It sounds like you&#039;re ordering weed, which is plentiful on SR, so I&#039;d agree with the other posters and suggest you look elsewhere.

				New clients FE or new vendors. Take a pick . I go for the new vendors should not ask clients to FE . They should give free samples first of all. And again a new client should FE early or buy the smallest amount . Back to free samples again. And it goes on and on.&nbsp; Both cases are, any part can chose to scam. And no winners or looser at this moment. Not in the long run anyway.<br /><br /><br />Now its for you to take sides.<br /><br />Stay safe, safe as milk.
