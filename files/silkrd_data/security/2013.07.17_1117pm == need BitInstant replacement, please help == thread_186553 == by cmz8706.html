				yeah I&#039;m one of those guys.<br />I&#039;m f*cked since Bit Instant decided to suddenly change everything.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Bit Instant for over a year because it worked perfectly every single time.<br />now their sh*t is broken and I have no alternatives because I haven&#039;t tried anything else.<br /><br />can someone please recommend a service that is similar to Bit Instant in terms of how easy it was?<br />I don&#039;t want some crap like Bitcoin OTC which requires it&#039;s own Wiki just to figure out.<br /><br />I want another way to buy bitcoins with cash that go directly into my Silk Road wallet.<br />are there any other services which do this? thanks guys.

				Hey Cmz, I found myself in the SAME situation. Pulling my hair out trying to figure out a new system. I just successfully got coins in under an hour from request on local bitcoins .com. I would use again no doubt. PM me if you want more info. Coin will go into &quot;localbitcoin&quot; wallet then you transfer to SR for a small fee of .003. Not bad. Im waiting for them to show up in SR. But from local guy to localbitcoin wallet was VERY fast, within 10 min!<br />Good luck!

				Use localbitcoins.com Use tor and no real names... you don&#039;t have to buy from people who live near you. People post transactions/listings and they always have ways of getting money to them... depositing in a bank is the best option.. You won&#039;t get in trouble unless you do something stupid etc, Usually pay 7-12 dollars over what the BTC is worth and thats it. You can also mail cash, money gram, reeloadit card (for that use a vender on here because it looks like solid 20% on reloadit cards.. Just&nbsp; do bank deposit or money gram... You&#039;ll figure it out. <br /><br />-Bill Paxton
