Box. I allowed them to receive letter from a fake name as well, first question:<br /><br />1) Do i really need to use a fake name?<br /><br />Okay, Bitcoins. I decided to use BitFloor.com because they use a bank very close to my house. Now, on their site, you put your deposited amount (i.e. $140USD) and then they give you an amount a little over a very specific. THEN you have money in bitcoin form to withdrawal.<br /><br />My BIG Question(s) is this:<br /><br />2) Is this legit? They have seem to have very good standing, also,<br /><br />3) HOW ON EARTH DO I GET THEM INTO MY SILK ROAD ACCOUNT????<br /><br />that last one is the main things I need to do. You make withdrawals from www.bitfloor.com and I&#039;m just wondering to see how I can get them nice and pretty into my account so I can place my order asap. <br /><br />PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME WITH THIS SOMEWHAT EASY QUESTION.<br /><br />I cant wait to order and if anyone can help me please do so as soon as possible bc im about to put a decent amount online. <br /><br />....on a side note, does anyone know officially how much USD ($$$) ONE bitcoin with worth?? <br /><br />Now if anyone can please do so as soon as posible.<br /><br />Love ya guys,<br /><br />R<br /><br />

				1. I don&#039;t really know the answer to that one. Some people say to go ahead and use a fake, others say not to because it&#039;s generally safer.<br /><br />2. I personally use bitinstant.com. It gives me the option to make a bank deposit which I like, but like all intermediary, they charge a small fee, usually 5% plus $1. <br /><br />3. You have two options: a) put them directly into your silk road account (go to account to see what your address is. In case you couldn&#039;t figure out, it&#039;s the one with all the letters and numbers.) or b) get a wallet for your bitcoins. I really only put my funds directly into my SR account; shorter wait time.<br /><br />4. http://preev.com/. It&#039;s looking like it&#039;s about $12.50 per bitcoin right now.

				Really I think you need to do some more homework. But here is the answer to most of your question.<br />1. No using a fake name raise eyebrows, Most vendor ask that you do not use a fake name, if you do decide to you a fake name, Aleast get a friend to mail you some legal packages so the mail man gets used to the fake name. PO Box not really that great of an idea, why because you have to use an id to open one. <br />2. The site is legit yes, are there scammers yes. My recommendation, Find a vendor with above 300 transcation and above 98% rep. Secondly order demostic. I know its tempting to get something across the pond. But lets face it paranoida for 2 weeks is no fun. Get used to the site first.<br />3.Mt.gox will have the current rate updating constantly, Sr is based very close to this rate but it updates knowingly for dramatic changes.<br />4. Always get more coins then you plan on getting, Usually after fee and shipping an Item is usually 10-15 dollars more then adveristed.<br />The Process of getting bitcoins. Note this is not really that great for orders larger then 500.<br />First make an Account on MT.GOX.<br />Once that is setup up. You can use the same account over and over again<br />Then go to bitinstant. Setup what ever method what to do cash desposit with, Note the account number to send to it will be your mt.gox username<br />Once you complete the cash desposit<br />Go back to mt.gox, you should see the money that bitinstant transfered in your mt.gox account. Minus the fee.<br />Now you must buy the bitcoins using the mt.gox account. Look at the graphs, or just buy them at rate they give you.<br />Once you see you have btc in your mt.gox account. Go fund label in mt.gox. Withdraw, Then enter in the amount of bitcoins to withdraw. And put your SR address which is found under your account setting or for extra secuity make a couple of bitcoin wallets and wash it threw that note this is not required and it takes alot longer.<br />Then you should see your bitcoins in your sr account in the next couple of hours. YES HOURS, DONT FREAK OUT WHEN YOU DONT SEE THEM IN 10mins.

When you go on Bitinstant, it will ask you where you want your bitcoins deposited ie, Mtgox, paypal, bitcoin address. Choose address, and copy and paste that long ass line of text into the field. Like gtrmonkey said you&#039;ll want to deposit more than you actually need because of commission and fluctuation of USD to bitcoin.<br /><br />If you want to make deposits anonymously, I wouldn&#039;t do an online bank transfer.

				PO BOXES DO NOT ASK YOU TO USE AN ID TO CHECK.....IDIOT. YOU JUST NEED THE KEY. WHICH I HAVE,<br /><br />To everyone else, When SR ask what to have on the address front, should I NOT use my real name or use the my real one? Everyone says to use a fake one for trustcash, bc it doesnt matter, but for the actual mailing address, do I put my real name for SR?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />

				I think the safest way to post the vendor your mailing address is via pgp-encrypted-email,<br />sent out parallel to your order.<br />Notice that he needs to have your public-key to open your email.<br /><br />If you choose that way, you can be pretty sure that no one (not even SR)&nbsp; gets information about your delivery destination.<br />I think that is the only way to be on the safe-side.<br />But what shall we put in the adress-box, recommended by SR when placing an order?<br />I think just a fake name, or better a short info about mailing via pgp directly.<br /><br />Everyone agrees?

				Guys okay get this,<br /><br />I mean twice a few years back, I ordered 2mg XANAX from an Indian pharmacy. As you well know, Xanax without a script is quite illegal. THEN i was a newbie. I used my own credit card, own name, and had it set to my my house. TWICE. and aeverything went perfect.<br /><br />How will all this SUPER under ground stuff, and using everyone&#039;s iwallet address, trustcash, etc and placing ONE order to a PO box? I mean really what on earth are the chances of getting caught? I&#039;ll check the box everyday after seven days and as soon as I get my little letter with five tabs in it, grab and run. I think ill be okay. And why on earth are five LSD tabs like $20+??

That was very rude of you. Who are you to call anyone an idiot on this forum, I had enough common sense to figure this out. You have never recieved a package from Sr, you probably cant even get bitcoins with out a moneypak with high fees. And I am the idiot? You sir are Childish and lazy. Figure this shit out your self, Like All the other people did, instead of begging for help. I took sweet time out my day to write you a Step by Step, which is fairly correct. When they dont ship to you because of a P.O Box. Dont come back screaming how I got scammed or how nobody will deal with me because S.R is fake.

The vendor does not need your key to read the mail as you would be using his public key to encrypt the message you should include your key for ease of reply.&nbsp; Fake name for setting up PGP yes but when it comes to the mail system you want something that you can use to recieve mail if asked.&nbsp; The protection is deniability
