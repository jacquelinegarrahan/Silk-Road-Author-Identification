				I have used this method before and it worked for getting bitcoins, but I have questions about the anonymity of it.<br /><br />*CLEARNET* http://bitcoinwithpaypal.com/<br /><br />The fees were pretty heavy and hidden. At the end I got .1 BTC less than the exact exchange rate on coinbase, the fee % came out to be around 13-15% from an exact exchange. Pretty big, it was a small amount and I wanted to test it out so I didn&#039;t care.<br /><br />It is not anonymous, if LE were to investigate you I wonder if they would bring it up and say what happened to the 2 BTC you bought? Where are they now? That could be used towards a conviction. I have the amount I bough in a BTC wallet and am unsure what I should do with it... Probably will just fog it up and use it here.<br /><br />Local bitcoins bank transfer option seems to be better than this.

				sure... use your brothers paypal and throw him under the bus.<br /><br />Well, lets say you are a small time buyer, spending $50 / month. Risk is not too big, that LE will spend hours and hours on tracing you. But buying BTCs in your own name is a bad idea if you also do SR. BTC is not something that government likes.&nbsp; Not even to speak of the &quot;dark forces controlling fiat currency&quot; (do reading before saying its bs).<br /><br />And paypal will hand out your info to LE&nbsp; &nbsp;F A S T E R&nbsp; &nbsp;than you can look. that can cause all sort of problems.<br /><br />There is much better ways to get BTCs than use PP.
