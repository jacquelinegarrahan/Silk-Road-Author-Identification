				YES-- But you need more then just the MTCN. You need to have the sender make sure and tell the agent you have NO ID and to mark a box that no ID is needed(the box is on their computer screen, not on the paper the sender fills out). That is important... Just because the sender puts down the question and answer does not automatically mean pick up with NO ID is ok, the agent has to check the box, I would say 50% of agents don&#039;t do it. The receiver MUST check after it is sent to make sure the agent did it right. Then the sender has to put down a question and an answer. <br /><br />So you need a question,&nbsp; answer, MTCN, City and State the money was sent from, and name of sender and receiver.<br />

				Can you send WU Payments to someone without providing an ID (If its less than 1000.00). It seems like the one time I tried this at a grocery store they did ask for ID.&nbsp; I&#039;m reading a lot of conflicting info online but most of it is from 2005 or earlier.&nbsp; Just wondering if I can walk into a WU location, give them a fake name, and send someone money or are they going to ask for ID after I give them my name and then I have to leave :)

What you do is make sure you have the MTCN number and have the sender put&nbsp; password on the account. As long as you have the MTCN and the password they&#039;ll give you the money.
