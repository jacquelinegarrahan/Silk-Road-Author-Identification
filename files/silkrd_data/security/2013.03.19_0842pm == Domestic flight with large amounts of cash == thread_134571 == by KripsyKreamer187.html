				I know in the US there is no limit on how much money you can fly with, but the TSA will question you if they suspect its for criminal use and may make you prove where the money came from.<br /><br />My question is say I&#039;m flying to another state with 13k and I make 20k a year. Would showing them my W2 be enough to prove where I got the money because we all know that I got it from &quot;lucrative business deals&quot; and not work. <br /><br />BTW I&#039;m going to buy a car not do anything illegal. Just looking to see if anyone has done this/does this regularly and what the best way to go about it is. Thanks in advance.

				I&#039;ve flown with about 10k before.&nbsp; It was all 100s though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think its uncommon for people going on vacation to have a lot of cash.&nbsp; 13k might be a bit much but I think if you blend in it wont be a problem.&nbsp; Put a few k in your wallet a few k in your pocket, a few in your checked luggage.&nbsp; Or check a few bags and split it up.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t bring your w2, I would just act confident like there is no way they can say anything.&nbsp;

				As you said, there is nothing illegal about traveling domestically with lots of cash. You can walk onto an airplane with a briefcase full of cash, it&#039;s not illegal. It will however raise suspicions and raise questions, that the authorities have every right to ask and which you probably don&#039;t want to answer. So the only way to travel with cash is try to slip underneath the radar by looking normal, and if you are questioned, you have two options as anyone dealing with LE<br />1) Remain silent and if they turn the screws on you, ask for a lawyer.<br />2) Lie to them in hopes that you can convince them that you really are just bringing the cash to buy a car.<br /><br />I would not put money in checked luggage. I&#039;ve had stupid stuff stolen from my checked luggage, like souvenirs. Just imagine what will happen when that TSA employee making $10/ hour opens your checked luggage with an envelope of cash.

				Never in checked bags, always on person as business papers/docs (ie. not a brown paper bag you picked up from Tony) and don&#039;t worry.

				I&#039;ve carried $20k or so many times on flights. I always dressed up in business attire and had cash in a couple different places on me like other posters have stated. Take a girl with you and split between you if are worried and have a simple cover story for the cash. I would tell you mine but then I couldn&#039;t use it again.
