				Hi.<br /><br />Ive been buying bicoins via mtgox for a while now by transferring money into there uk bank account.<br /><br />I recently made a inquiry to see if its possible to pay into there Barclays account by making the transfer over the counter in a local branch.<br /><br />Has anybody used this option before.<br /><br />I figured it would be easier and slightly more anonymous paying it in at the local branch instead of making transfers from my own account

You should bear in mind that if you used your own bank account to do the same, anyone with access to MtGox&#039;s record will be able to link your identity to the BTC address from which you send the coins and for subsequent transactions.<br /><br />As such, I recommend you use a mixer like Bitcoinfog to &quot;tumble&quot; your coins this time round. Why don&#039;t you send me a message next time you need some, I&#039;d be happy to do business with you!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

I only deposited a small amount (Â£30) just incase it didn&#039;t work but it was all pretty straightforward - filled out the slip with Mtgox&#039;s details as per their website and handed the slip over with the cash at the counter. The slip asks for the name of the person depositing but I didn&#039;t use my real name and was just going to claim I didn&#039;t have any ID on me if they asked for any.. was seriously paranoid, haha! It took about four days for me to get the BTC, I raised a support ticket with Mtgox after three days asking when I could expect it but but their reply actually coincided with my coins being credited soooo patience is important I guess! But all in all it was pretty simple and I&#039;d rather do it this way than transfer funds directly from my account.<br /><br />Hope this helps :-)<br />Molly

				it does work but when i did it a while ago i sent support ticket asfter 48 hours and told em i paid cash and they said u not allowed to do cash deposits and they dont know what will happen&nbsp; to the money and then it appeared anyway<br /><br />i dont think they like u doing it and i dont like it really as there known for asking for verification and just locking accounts so i imagine they might&nbsp; do that to accounts who do big cash deposits regular
