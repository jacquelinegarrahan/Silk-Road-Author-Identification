				For anybody who gets their bitcoins from tradehill, and gets dollars into tradehill from dwolla ... well it hasn&#039;t been working for a couple days now.&nbsp; Tradehill and Dwolla had a sort of falling out, and after that, tradehill made you go thru bitinstant if you wanted to transfer dollers, and bitinstant has been broken a couple days at least.&nbsp; <br /><br />This would only matter if, say, you had dollars stuck in dwolla, and you wanted to buy btc from tradehill....well, can&#039;t transfer.&nbsp; Worse yet, it turns out Exchangebitcoin doesn&#039;t take dwolla.&nbsp; Best I can tell, dwolla has pulled some fast moves, and wouldn&#039;t answer tradehill when they tried to talk to some of the higherups.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />One of the reasons people have wandered over to exchangebitcoin to do their trading: no, they don&#039;t take dwolla, if you have bills stuck there, but with all the stuff going on, they&#039;re still easier to deal with...and it&#039;s not that hard to just put your funds back in your bank, from dwolla, and go thru Exchangebitcoin.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDIT: Today I checked, and TradeHill can now take deposits thru bitinstant again.&nbsp; In other words, if you&#039;ve put dollers in dwolla or libertyreserve, u can now depost them into TradeHill again.&nbsp; Not near as handy as exchangeBtc was, but compared to mtgox&#039;s troubles...hell...<br />
