				^Seriously. There is no way this is anything but satire.<br /><br />Every forum on the internet eventually becomes like this. To be more clear, every forum on the internet dealing in &quot;underworld&quot; illegal shit eventually becomes exactly like this. Most people need to have an incentive to produce quality stuff that other people want to buy. If someone is actually selling computer security lessons for $5K, then they are either very, very good lessons from someone with a verifiable reputation or else it&#039;s an obvious scam that only an idiot would fall for.<br /><br />Also rock stars? WTF?? How can you be an an anonymous rock star?&nbsp; Why would anyone want journalists here writing sensationalist bullshit about something many of us rely on to provide us with medicine that we can&#039;t get anywhere else. No, not everyone is using SR to get recreationally &quot;high&quot;, and no one is dumb enough to share &quot;effective techniques&quot; used to hide things from LE on an anonymous forum with open registration.<br /><br />But yeah, this was fun. If you are serious, then you expect way too much from humanity. I give you a C+ on your poem/suicide note though.

				Hey folks.<br /><br />Troll or not. Dead or not (and I hope not) we should show concern and not take pleasure from the prospect of someone killing themselves. For someone to even threaten such an act there is something very wrong.<br /><br />We are all different and have good days and bad days. We sometimes say the wrong things at the wrong times and to the wrong people. We have all regretted something we have said or done and this may be true of the &quot;I hate your culture&quot; post.<br /><br />My 2 cents.<br /><br />
