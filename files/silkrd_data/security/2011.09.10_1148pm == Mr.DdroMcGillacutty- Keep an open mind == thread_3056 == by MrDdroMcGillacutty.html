				HUGE&nbsp; ;D ! WE ALL JUST GOT A LOT SAFER AS A COMMUNITY. Honest. I put my 250+ positive reputation on it! I believe that is saying something about how serious and honest I am being. As a vendor that is all I have here. MY REPUTATION. <br /><br />I can&#039;t/shouldn&#039;t/won&#039;t say what I know. But I know&nbsp; ;D Things are looking up. For us as a community (sooner) and for the BTC in general (later). I am so happy. Remember I called it first, lol. Everyone will understand later. I am not sure how much later. Changes are coming :)<br /><br />PERSONAL THANK YOU TO SR. For everything.

Changes are always coming&nbsp; 8) A curious clue is &quot;not sure how much later&quot;, which implies that there are some unknowns to your mental arithmetic -- which resolves the entire topic to, at best -- speculation. But hey, speculation precedes investment! Speculation precedes experimentation.

				Keep an open mind. Geez. I know something you don&#039;t and I am NOT at liberty to say much. Zeus himself would strike me down. LOL.&nbsp; No speculation. Changes to the site are coming. Some you will notice, some you will not. CORRECT. I do not have all the answers. I am not talking about perpetual changes that happen. I mean HUGE BIG CHANGES. SECURITY for one is going up. I know that for a fact. I LOVE SECURITY STUFF!! Full implementation timeline I am not privy to. Exciting things that take time are coming and I am involved from the sidelines. I am right on the edge of the chalky white sideline. I AM NOT PERSONALLY directly involved in anything. SO we are clear. I just know about them and am ECSTATIC about it. Yes insider info. Way positive and way inside. I put my rep on it. HUGE. EPIC. I wonder whatever happened about the new admin hire? Hmmm. I haven&#039;t heard much on that subject for a while.<br /><br />The doubters will doubt. The haters are mostly full of crap and it&#039;s funny sometimes. But I know. And when changes start happening people will say &quot;Hmmm. I wonder if that was one of the things MrDdro was talking about.&quot; Ya it is. <br /><br /><br />~hint~

If you see what it means -- they accept too quickly, and close their mind to the potentially more excellent explanations had they just taken the time to investigate a little further. Open minded does include skepticism and fact finding -- something which often results in the open minded person being told to: &quot;be more open minded&quot;&nbsp; :o luckily, irony is not such a harsh mistress..........<br /><br />Well said by you in any case, and consider me to be sharing your enthusiastic anticipation of the changes in motion.

I agree with you, skepticism and open-mindedness go hand in hand. If only politicians and the rest of society thought this way. Well... we wouldn&#039;t need this site anyway.
