				I have been using Coinbase for awhile and am very happy with the speed and ease of transactions.&nbsp; Not sure if they have a relationship with Dwolla as I don&#039;t use them anymore.

				&nbsp;you should find out why they closed your account or just open another. i have two accounts at campbx, one for dwolla and another for moneyorders. <br /><br />campbx is superior to all others because of their rates. took a quick look at localbitcoins and coinbase and their rates are at least .10c higher..... also not sure why anyone would want to &#039;localize&#039; themselves when trading in bitcoins aka localbitcoins.
