But once it’s alone in a room full of law enforcement officials, you might be surprised at the revealing things it will say about you.<br /><br />On Tuesday the American Civil Liberties Union published a report it obtained from a drug investigation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, documenting the seizure and search of a suspect’s iPhone from her bedroom. While it’s no surprise that a phone carries plenty of secrets, the document presents in stark detail a list of that personal information, including call logs, photos, videos, text messages, Web history, eight different passwords for various services, and perhaps most importantly, 659 previous locations of the phone invisibly gathered from Wifi networks and cell towers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Is this surprising?<br /><br />And this is not limited to just IPhones. If you have ever had incriminating information or have called numbers known to be associated with illegal activities, just pray that your phone never gets confiscated. <br /><br />Your cell phone provider has a record of all texts and calls as well.<br /><br />Try as hard as you can to not conduct illegal business from a cell phone associated with your name in any way. Burner phonessssss ftw

				all apple products suck. THey limit the user with all their proprietary bullshit. And that 4-pin-passcode is a joke.<br /><br />SWIM recommend if your phone offers an encryption feature, utilize it. Most non-Iphone smart phones offer this as an added plus to their business clients who may have company sensitive information on their phone. Just go into your security settings and see if your phone supports encrypting your device. Takes about 2 hours to encrypt it initially and just make sure you choose a cleaver password that is long with alpha-numeric-symbols. <br /><br />If your phone is ever intercepted, just refuse to unlock it. Police can&#039;t make you unlock it, only a judge can. At most, LE can try to bruteforce the password.

				Smart phones were conceived in area 51, they were initially only going to be issued to all the extra-terrestrial lifeforms living with us, but it was decided by officials to supply them worldwide en-masse for their data collection departments.<br /><br />sorry, ive been watching x-files again

We all know how fair the justice system is, especially towards drug users/dealers.
