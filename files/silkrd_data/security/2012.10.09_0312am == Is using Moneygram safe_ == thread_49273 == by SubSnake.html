				Is using the Moneygram service to buy bitcoins safe?<br />I would assume not, seeing as the MG service requires identity details. However, I make sure to pass my BTC through a few wallets before spending anywhere.<br /><br />Can BTC be tracked? What&#039;s a safer alternative to using Moneygram?

				I&#039;m pretty sure you just use a fake name. I don&#039;t think it requires photo ID. Anyways, I&#039;d use trustcash if I were you. Really simple. Use Bitinstant and just use the &quot;Major Bank Branch&quot; option. All you do is print the invoice, walk into the bank (you choose it on the site and it&#039;s on the invoice), give them the invoice then the money. Say you want to make a deposit. Grab receipt, go home, BTC should be in your wallet in an hour or so. BTC have taken long times before getting into the wallet so don&#039;t fret at first. As long as you double and even triple check the addresses you will be OK.<br /><br />Also, use a fake name when Bitinstant/Trustcash ask for it. You can use a @Tormail.org if you want but I think you can use a fake email *NOT SURE*.<br /><br />Good luck.

The only way to make it untraceable is to tumble it with a service like bitcoin tumbler. You can search for it on DuckDuckGo (http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/). Just search &quot;Bitcoin Fog&quot;. You should find their clearnet site with a link to the .onion.

				It can be followed to an SR wallet, but nobody will know that it&#039;s an SR wallet from the address alone. If this isn&#039;t your first transfer to SR, I recommend you click on the &quot;get new address&quot; option in your account settings. Also, check out the new address on Blockchain.info to make sure nobody has ever used that wallet address before - highly unlikely, but still possible.

				I don&#039;t have as much knowledge on this as others so I wouldn&#039;t want to say I know, but I&#039;d say there&#039;s a well over50-60% chance it&#039;s as safe as other payment methods.

Once your bitcoins are sent to SR, they are no longer YOUR bitcoins per say. The amount you see on your account is simply a database entry that SR maintains according to what you have funded it.<br /><br />It&#039;s much like a bank - when you deposit money in a bank and then come back to take the money out... you aren&#039;t receiving the same money. Ever. Getting a new address is like your checking account or credit card being compromised - they just issue a new one and the world keeps on spinning :P<br />.Hades.

				Yea bro money gram is safe.. Fake name fake email everyting, best email to use cause u may need someof their stuff if something messed up, look into www.mailinator.com&nbsp; &nbsp;U dont sign up or nothing no person info...U could be out and about someone ask for ur email and if u dont want them to have your person email tell them for example fuckyou@mailinator.com then go to the website type that in and the email will be there, very conveienant and i would think safe since non of your info is asked for no password or nothing, its a throw away email like a couple others out there.. Bitinstant i think is the best. I even send my coins right to my SR account, if you dont know SR has a tumbler and unless your sending a massive amount useualy your gonna buy something fast anyway, but still your in the clear BITCOINS ARE LEGAL... When i printed up my receipt i didnt even realize i have a place 5min from my house, i take it in she asks my name (NO ID) and then she puts it into the computer i pay i get a receipt im gone...Then i come back home i go to blockchain and put my SR account # at the bottom so i can see when it starts an make sure there is no issue, it useally takes about 10 to 12 transaction i think is the word it uses at the bottom...But blockchain has every bitcoin wallet on there, weather u have one with them or not.. I have one with blockchain also but then i realized SR has a tumbler so when the coins make it to the GOLDEN ROAD its safe your safe its all good, yuou have coins and then its time to buy goodies...I just recently met a guy on FB in my state who has the 10mg opana IR the pink ones, and he has a delivery service, it takes about 4 5 hours for them to show up they have no clue what it is other than a box with a nestle bag of coffe with the pillz vaccum sealed inside, and u pay COD, just as awsome as the road, and get this the guy only wants 1 dollar for the PINK 10MG IR OPANA~~~!!!&nbsp; they are easly 50bucks, hes got all kinda shit..anyway sorry OP , yea your safe

				What about the Bitcoin Qt application? It&#039;s just a BTC wallet program. Is this considered unsafe?
