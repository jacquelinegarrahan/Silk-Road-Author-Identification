				I hung out with&nbsp; the GreenCo packaging guys last night and&nbsp; 20%-25% of customers have poorly formatted mailing addresses.<br /><br />The goal is to blend in and not get noticed. Write your address like any company that sends you mail. This seems like a total no brainier to me but I guess the most obvious security stuff is what people ignore.<br /><br />GreenCo sends addresses to a package labeler&nbsp; with very little human oversight. So many people SCREW UP THEIR OWN ADDRESSES that they have to go over each one. It is often hard to tell what an address is supposed to look like. <br /><br />Apparently many of you have never written an address on an actual letter so here is a little refresher.<br /><br />Your Name<br />123 Main St<br />Apt 99<br />Good City, CA 95123<br /><br />Addresses should be 3 or 4 lines. No line should be crazy long. <br /><br />If you write your address ALLCAPS or alllowercase it will be printed that way, it will look unprofessional,&nbsp; it will stick out,&nbsp; and it will put you at more risk. If you use poor punctuation or write the address in one line you are screwing yourself. <br /><br />The poor packaging guys end up rewriting a lot of them. This means they have to look at your address, which is a security risk. It also takes a lot of time and delays orders and slows down everyone&#039;s delivery time. It is just pain hard to figure some of them out.<br /><br />Use all the PGP and Tor you want - or not- but get your own mailing address right.<br /><br />

				Needed its own thread? Send your customers a message if this is an issue. Seems like the real issue is GC blindly mailing to any address without a simple once over. my 2 cents.

				I think what KB is saying is not only for GC&#039;s processes, but for any buyer on SR.&nbsp; A messed up address is just one more thing to catch attention. Between vac sealing and good packaging, it would suck to have an address raise suspicion.&nbsp; An address in the wrong format/spelled wrong would be the only thing that looked out of place with GC&#039;s packaging. I figure its just one more minute detail to add for security, and it shouldn&#039;t be a hassle for the buyer to do their part to keep both parties safe.

				Ive been behind the scenes with USPS workers and you wouldn&#039;t believe the shit they see all day. Handwriting is the worst problem for slowing a package. As long as you give a valid address and a vendor is willing to add some spaces and capital letters and not be lazy (like GC) there should be no problem.
