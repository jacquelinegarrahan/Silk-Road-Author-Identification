				recieved a link to a privnote on my messages from vendor, it linked me to a block of text that is identical to a pgp encrypted message, but without the regular formatting <br />-----Begin Pgp.....<br /><br />It is just a block of text, I have formatted it as best i can for my clipboard to decrypt it, but it doesnt recognize OpenPGP code anywhere....<br /><br />help will be greatly appreciated in the form of .2 btc ( a buck, what the fuck :))

				I can&#039;t see any crypto-garble.<br /><br />Did you try adding the formatting to the top? It&#039;s either a signature or a message. The signature would verify they have access to the private key, and the message would be encrypted with _your_ public key (to be decrypted with your private key). If you haven&#039;t given him your public key yet, it must be a signature, or she/he messed up.

				i didnt include the text in the OP, i added the Begin PGP Key and all that, made sure no line was longer than 64 characters and did all i could, i have the vendors key, and he sent this twice via privnote, hes a very busy vendor so iwouldnt want to bother him again, I thought the first one was fucked up with out the PGP formatting etc... and when he resent, same thing...<br /><br /><br /><br />if my version of pgp is different and i try to supplant the pgp formatting from mine for his would that cause issues?<br /><br />i just checked his key, his version of gpg is the same as mine

				Sounds like he might be trying to send _you_ an encrypted message, which is only possible if you have given him a public key.<br /><br />1) copy/paste the _exact_ text into a _real_ text editor (emacs or vi) and save it, then decrypt using your private key (if you have a key; I&#039;m not sure what the vendor could be trying to do otherwise)
