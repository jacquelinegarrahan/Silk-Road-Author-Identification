				First, install GPGTools: http://www.gpgtools.org/installer/index.html<br /><br />Next, create a key for Silk Road and/or Silk Road Forums:<br />- open GPG Keychain Access from your Applications directory<br />- click New<br />- in Full name, enter your Silk Road username and your Forum username so people can find you in their key list. if they are different names and you don&#039;t mind people associating your two accounts, put both separated by a space (or for advanced users who have two different names, make two keys, one for each)<br />- in E-mail address, enter a fake email (or a secure email like your tormail or countermail address if you&#039;d like)<br />- you can leave everything else as-is<br />- click Generate key<br />- in the passphrase prompt, enter something that would be very, very hard to guess. adding numbers, capitol letters, punctuation, and using many characters helps. the program warns you if it thinks your passphrase is too weak. you hopefully know the passphrase drill by now. when it tells you to, move your mouse cursor around to help the computer make the keys more random (as you, a human being, are far more random than a CPU chip 8))<br /><br />Now, lets enable OS X-wide access to some of GPGTools&#039; features from within other applications to make it easier to do common GPGTools tasks, such as importing others&#039; public keys and encrypting messages right from within your browser:<br />- open OS X&#039;s System Preferences (from the Apple menu or the Dock, for example)<br />- open Keyboard preferences<br />- click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab<br />- in the left column, click Services<br />- in the right column, scroll down to Text<br />- in the Text section (these are the indented entries beneath the line that says &quot;Text&quot;) check the boxes next to OpenPGP: Decrypt, OpenPGP: Encrypt, OpenPGP: Import key, and OpenPGP: Insert my key<br /><br />NOTE: For the below tips, &quot;application menu&quot; refers to the menu for the current program you are using such as &quot;Aurora&quot; or &quot;Firefox&quot; or &quot;TextEdit&quot;. It is in the top menu bar next to the Apple menu and is bold. (Extra credit: For Apple applications such as TextEdit, you can also get to some of the same &quot;OpenPGP: &lt;command name&gt;&quot; commands by right-clicking on selected text, but not in Aurora or Firefox, unfortunately... not sure why.)<br /><br />When you find somebody&#039;s public key you&#039;d like to import (such as on a Silk Road seller&#039;s profile page):<br />- select the key text (from the first --- through all the lines of gobbledegook to the last ---)<br />- in the application menu, in the Services sub-menu, select OpenPGP: Import key<br />and viola! you have their public key ;D<br /><br />The other options work similarly, but only in editable text areas where you can type, such as when you are writing a forum post, personal message, or entering your address for an order. This is because these commands are altering the text in-place.<br /><br />For example, to encrypt your address for an order (after you have the sellers public key imported as per the above instructions):<br />- in the text area for your address (where it says &quot;Please enter your name and address as it would be written on a letter&quot;) type your address (then double-check your address, then triple check)<br />- select your address<br />- in the application menu, in the Services sub-menu, select OpenPGP: Encrypt<br />- in the dialog that pops up you will see a list of keys you&#039;ve imported - check the box for the seller&#039;s key<br />- uncheck the box near the bottom that says &quot;Add to Recipients&quot; (this refers to yourself, so you are saying to only encrypt it for the above-checked recipient and not also for yourself) (this step is optional, but why not do it and save your computer the extra effort :P)<br />- click OK<br />viola! your address is PGP encrypted and only the seller can decrypt it! ;D<br /><br />To encrypt a personal message to another user or seller (after you have imported their public key as per the above instructions):<br />- in the text area for your message, type your message<br />- if this is your first message to this user and you want to give them your public key so they can send you an encrypted reply:<br />&nbsp; + at the end of your message, type something like &quot;Here is my key:&quot; and then enter to the beginning of a new line<br />&nbsp; + in the application menu, in the Services sub-menu, select OpenPGP: Insert my key<br />&nbsp; + if you have multiple, select the appropriate key for the site you are on (e.g. your SR name if you are writing an SR message) (i would advise against using a key with your real name/email)<br />&nbsp; + click &quot;Choose Private-Key&quot; (don&#039;t worry, it inserts the associated public key)<br />- select your entire message (including your own key if you included it)<br />- in the application menu, in the Services sub-menu, select OpenPGP: Encrypt<br />- in the dialog that pops up you will see a list of keys you&#039;ve previously imported - check the box for the intended recipient&#039;s key<br />- underneath where it says &quot;Secret Key&quot;, make sure the key (*your* key) you want to use for SR (or forum) communication is selected, and make sure the box next to &quot;Add to Recipients&quot; (which might be better titled &quot;Add myself as a recipient&quot;) is checked (this is so that you can decrypt your own message later if you wish)<br />- click OK<br />viola! your message is PGP encrypted and only you and your intended recipient can decrypt it! ;D<br /><br />To decrypt a message someone sent to you which was encrypted using your public key:<br />- select the encrypted message text (from the first --- through all the lines of gobbledegook to the last ---)<br />- right-click and copy the text<br />- open TextEdit from your Applications directory<br />- paste the text<br />- re-select the same exact text<br />- in the application menu, in the Services sub-menu, select OpenPGP: Decrypt (OR right-click the selected text and click OpenPGP: Decrypt, since we are in an Apple program)<br />- in the prompt, enter your password and press enter (I would advise *against* checking the box to store the passphrase in your keychain - otherwise anyone can decrypt your messages if they gain access to your computer and are logged in)<br />and viola! you have an unencrypted message. ;D<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you thought this was helpful and you want to give me a lil donation you can send it to:<br />SR user &#039;harrybradford&#039; :D

				Thanks so much for putting this up, really.<br />I am running into a problem though:<br />When I try and message someone and insert my public key nothing is in the scroll down menu except for a check mark and when I click choose private key nothing is added to the message.<br />Also, When I attempt to encrypt a message it says no usable private key found?<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry if these are dumb questions/I&#039;m doing something obviously wrong

				ok so after experimenting I&#039;ve found that it will insert my key and encrypt a message at times, but at other times it won&#039;t encrypt and my key wont show up in the scroll menu when trying to insert it<br />any idea why this is?<br />It seems that it works for the first few minutes of using it and then it just stops working?

				Nextlevelmike, same thing but I found the problem. When creating the key it automatically sets the expiry date at the current date and exact time, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s supposed to be a one year default (since it doesn&#039;t give you the option to change year) or just negligence, but it will therefore expire I assume shortly after creation. I set my date to 31st december and it works now. <br /><br />AHUM *cough* OK I just tried inserting it here and I see that it DOESN&#039;T work still, sometimes. I don&#039;t know what it is, it seems random. But mostly it works.<br /><br />Soooo, anyone have the solution, much appreciated.

				TO ALL OS X USERS:<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and download &quot;PortablePGP&quot; and use this launcher to start it in OS:<br />http://www.instantcrypt.com/InstantCrypt_CompatiblePrograms_LinuxApple.php<br /><br />It&#039;s much easier and faster to use. Same goes to windows users :)

				vassup buddies,<br /><br />I was having the same problem - clicking &quot;insert my key&quot; and nothing coming up. AND, trying to encrypt something, and it wouldnt let me since I couldnt select my own key from the drop down menu.<br /><br />No idea if this will work for you, but give it a try - open up text edit, preferences, services, insert my key. Here, it worked - then it woudl start working in other situations, like encrypting a message in SR in firefox.<br /><br />Hope this works for you too.<br /><br />-2theBRUhaha&nbsp; :o

				Well...It looks as if I&#039;m having some issues &gt;:\<br /><br />First: When I highlight the vendors&#039; PGP key and tell Aurora to Import it to GPG, it tells me that 0 keys were imported. So to circumvent this issue, I copied the vendors&#039; PGP as a .text file on my computer, then imported that to GPG. This apparently works fine.<br /><br />However, Second: When I highlight my address and tell Aurora to encrypt it, it gives me an error which states: &quot;Encryption Failed -- No usable private key was found&quot;.<br /><br />Halp?

				After creating (your own) and importing the (vendor&#039;s) keys:<br /><br />Open up text edit<br />Convert to plain text (command+shift+T)<br />Type out your address 3 times - make sure it is correct<br /><br />Hit Return twice<br /><br />Right click (control click) and insert fingerprint and/or key<br /><br />Highlight with your mouse and select your triple checked shipping address and key/fingerprint in textedit<br /><br />Right click and Services -&gt; OpenGPG: Encrypt<br /><br />Select your vendor, select your SR key (I always choose sign and add myself to recipients, not sure if necessary)<br /><br />Only the text goes all squiggly, insert your key and fingerprint via right click -&gt;Services <br />Press Command+A to Select All<br />Press Command+C to Copy, <br />Press &amp; Hold Command, tap TAB to get back to Aurora, <br />Click inside the message box on the checkout page and hit command+v.<br /><br />Click BUY<br /><br />...And remember- escrow protects both parties (and your sanity as a new buyer :) )<br /><br />EDIT: Just installed InstantCrypt portable GPG (10.5-10.7)- much easier to use (no need for textedit in the middle):<br /><br />http://www.instantcrypt.com/InstantCrypt_CompatiblePrograms_LinuxApple.php<br /><br />Instructions on the linked page took 5-10 minutes.

				Alright, time for a stupid question. What is the easiest way to hide your SR name in GPG Keychain Access? Should I export/import all the keys every time I launch the app? <br /><br />Thing is..

				i am having a hell of a time getting this to work - i suspect early onset dementia.&nbsp; not really, but it sure feels like it!&nbsp; i have a text file into which i&#039;ve pasted my key.&nbsp; i then saved this .txt file, selected it, went to Services, selected &quot;Encrypt File&quot;, and chose which person i wanted to encrypt it for.&nbsp; this went fine.&nbsp; however, as soon as i actually tell it to start the encryption, a pop up box appears with a blue and white progress bar that never actually progresses.&nbsp; it just says &quot;GPGServices&quot; in the pop up window label and &quot;Encrypting &#039;Untitled.txt&#039;&quot; above the progress bar.<br /><br />nothing else happens.&nbsp; the progress bar just animates endlessly without progressing.<br /><br />i&#039;m running Mountain Lion with the latest builds (i believe!) of the GPGTools ...<br /><br />any ideas what i&#039;m doing wrong?&nbsp; should i try using Terminal instead?&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks for all of the help - i apologize for my newb-ness!

				Guru:<br /><br />Heading over to the PGP Club thread to try it out ... I re-installed the nightly builds of each component and suddenly it seems to be working!&nbsp; <br /><br />Do nightly builds update automatically, or should I return to the nightly build page and manually update them every day?&nbsp; Sorry, that question even sounds stupid, but I am clueless about nightly builds since each one shows a different date ... some from months back!
