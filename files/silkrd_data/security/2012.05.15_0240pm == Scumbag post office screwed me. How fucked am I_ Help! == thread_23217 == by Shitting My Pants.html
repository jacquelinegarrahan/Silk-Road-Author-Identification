				So, I got a P.O. Box six months ago in my real name.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t give me a renewal date, just told me that they put notices in the box when close to renewal time and I didn&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; (Yup, you can see where this is going.)<br /><br />I knew it was getting close to renewal time, so I checked the box last week before making an order.&nbsp; No notices.&nbsp; I go to check the box today and possibly pick up an order, and I&#039;m locked out.&nbsp; Post Office claims they put not one but two notices in there the last month.&nbsp; BULLSHIT they did.&nbsp; I literally haven&#039;t received anything in the box since I got it.&nbsp; &nbsp;But whatever, I renewed it and figured I&#039;ll just keep better track this time.<br /><br />Then they tell me any mail that came during the locked-out period was returned to sender.&nbsp; It was very possible my order came during this time.&nbsp; OH FUCK.<br /><br />So, now there&#039;s an order of fucking drugs with my real name on it linked to a P.O. Box I own getting sent back to God Knows Where.&nbsp; Obviously, I have contacted the seller to ask where this might be, but since I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not the seller&#039;s real address there are two possiblities:&nbsp; Either it&#039;s a real address somewhere or it&#039;s a nonexistent address.<br /><br />If it&#039;s a real address, then someone at that address may get my package, open it and find drugs, and report it.&nbsp; In which case, I am probably fucked.<br /><br />Assuming it&#039;s the latter option, and it&#039;s simply a nonexistent address, what then?&nbsp; What happens to packages that can&#039;t be returned to sender?&nbsp; Does USPS open it at any point?<br /><br />How fucked am I?<br /><br />Time to work on that fake ID problem.

				My 2 cents,<br /><br />Check up on the forums a lot more. There&#039;s so much information here to keep you safe you&#039;d be mad not to check it. After all it&#039;s free!<br /><br />On to your current situation, if it&#039;s a very small order I wouldn&#039;t work yourself up too much, just make sure your house is clean and if you have the capacity swap out your hard drive and leave it at a friends house for a few weeks. <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dank

				Sorry to hear this mate, I would definitely contact the vendor asap and ask whether they used a fake or real address. They usually know and should tell you in this case. <br /><br />If it was a real address, the chances of an actual investigation being started depend on the substance and amount you ordered, the country you ordered from and the recipient actually finding the product and reporting it. I&#039;d say, the chances of this happening are rather slim. <br /><br />In any case, as dank said,&nbsp; I would lay low for a while, clean your house and hope for the best!

				It&#039;s my own dumbass fault (partly anyway) for assuming the post office would really put a notice.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even think about it.&nbsp; And I sure as hell didn&#039;t think they&#039;d just return the stuff to sender.&nbsp; I mean, I&#039;ve had post office boxes before and I got mail all the time for past tenants of the boxes.&nbsp; It never even crossed my mind they would do that.

				Nothing will happen, since you haven&#039;t even received the drugs then you can&#039;t be prosecuted for it if the police did decide to investigate your PO BOX. You could say &quot;what? I had no idea anyone was going to send me that!&quot;. So relax. Your parcel will get sent back to the fake address and then binned.<br /><br />Note that it is an imprisonable offense in the UK to open any persons post other than your own without a warrant from a Judge or permission from the Queen. Hence it is Royal Mail (under the Queen&#039;s protection). So noone will open it, it&#039;s already past customs. It will get binned.<br /><br />Best next time you use a PO BOX service though to buy a fake driving license from here and use that to open it.

				I think you will be fine, its a small quantity so I doubt they will be assigning a task force to hunt you down :)<br /><br />BTW, why the PO Box?<br /><br />Whats the advantage of having stuff delivered to a PO Box rather than your home.&nbsp; If the PO Box is in your real name (and without fake forms of government ID there is no other way to open one in the UK) then it really dosent offer you any more protection than having it delivered to your home.<br /><br />Anyway hope you calm down a bit because there is very little chance of anything happening as a result.

				I had similar, but, well: Open one of those private boxes in my name,...but I just figured they&#039;d be like my mailmen and just keep everything as long as pckg was rite, and *no* they didn&#039;t, they said anything came in that time frame was &#039;sent back..&#039;&nbsp; And this was a sizeable package from OPI..rite address, some bizness name, .and so I put in biz on the card I hadn&#039;t before, but it was too late...<br /><br />They always use fake return addresses: they aren&#039;t crazy.&nbsp; And when I fuck up, I pay, so there was no point in getting vendor all involved...I just finalized early, figured fuck it, why make me and him both wait, and took the loss as &#039;training.&#039;&nbsp; Gave vendor 5/5 and left box blank or something like that....<br /><br />It seems in most cases, we *are* better using our own addy, that way mailman often will just stuff it in box &#039;anyway&#039; while private or postoffice themselves are more &#039;by the book..&#039;<br /><br />Unless it&#039;s a scam, all loses I take on my back.&nbsp; Customs and weird mailing shit, are on me...I like my reputation, and want to keep it that way...Only less than 5/5 comes from the two dickheads who ripped off a bunch of them, and thats to let newbs know to stay away....<br /><br />But I&#039;ve never understood dragging vendor into anything where they have no control, customs and outlaw addresses, I take the heat, as I should...
