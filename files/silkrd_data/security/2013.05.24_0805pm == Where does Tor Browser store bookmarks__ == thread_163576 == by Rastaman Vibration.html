				Does anyone know where Tor Browser stores bookmarks? Is it within the application or does it dump to a file somewhere?<br /><br />I&#039;m going back and cleaning up my computer from the mess I made in back in my utra-n00b days. When I first checked out SR, a friend showed it to me on my Mac that I use for work stuff.&nbsp; I thought it was fucking unreal and I bookmarked the site just for shits and giggles. This was WAY before I ever considered ordering from here. So I didn&#039;t know any better and bookmarked it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since upgraded my security to say the least. I use TAILS now. But thats a different story.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m going back and cleaning out my Mac and deleting anything that could be incriminating. I&#039;ve deleted all the old versions of Tor (with the bookmarks) off it. Are there any other files I should be deleting&nbsp; as well? Libraries or hidden files or anything like that? Any expert knowledge would be most helpful.<br /><br />BTW I&#039;m using the Secure Empty Trash on the Mac to delete. According to my research, it does a pretty adequate job on hard disks, enough to where someone would have to spend a lot of money if they wanted to recover what I deleted. I only purchase personal quantities, so its pretty unlikely that if LE were to ever seize my computer they would shell out big $$$ for forensics services. I just want to cover my tracks and delete anything obvious.<br /><br />Thanks

				If you secure deleted the entire TBB folder hierarchy and you believe that is a safe method (I don&#039;t know myself, but generally individual file overwrites are not safe), then you&#039;re good. Bookmarks are stored in /Data/profile/bookmarks.html and Data/profile/bookmarkbackups, which would have been deleted when you deleted the TBB folder hierarchy. <br /><br />Keep in mind, if you&#039;re trying to eliminate all traces of the browser bundle on your computer, there may be traces outside of the TBB folder hierarchy. A Tor developer is doing forensic analysis of that, but they haven&#039;t done Macs yet. You can read about the Windows and Linux analysis here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.0<br /><br />Hopefully in another month she will post the results for Macs.<br />

				Also the tor bundle basically uses Firefox, so if you wanted to backup your bookmarks elsewhere it the same as in Firefox.<br /><br />Bookmarks -- Show all bookmarks -- Import and Backup

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to delete all traces of Tor from the Mac, just the bookmarks from an old version. I use the Mac for work stuff, so destroying it is not an option :P Also I still have Tor on the Mac (new version, no SR bookmarks). I&#039;m not really worried about that, using Tor is perfectly legit/legal, and I was using Tor long before I ever discovered SR. I just want to delete any traces of the SR bookmark.<br /><br />Thanks again

				Torbrowser on Macs store everything within the app.<br />Trash the app and it&#039;s all gone, install the latest torbrowser, and it&#039;s all gone.<br />Both frustrating and fantastic.
