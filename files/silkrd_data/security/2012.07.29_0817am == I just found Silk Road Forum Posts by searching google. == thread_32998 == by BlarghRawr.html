				What is disadvantages of that? It&#039;s just some kinda proxy-service making the forums more available, we&#039;re still just as safe and all?<br />If its unwanted Im sure they&#039;ll block it with a simple robots.txt file or something to deny Google/outside access..&nbsp; <br />maybe its a good thing, bringing more attention and eventually a bigger stronger userbase..=)?

				I won&#039;t claim kmfkewm is an idiot as I don&#039;t believe he is unintelligent. However his views related to security and IT are more academic than practical and why I disagree with many of his particular views.<br /><br />Let me sum it up like this. There are many &#039;types&#039; of security professionals in the IT business. I&#039;ve worked in highly secure places, both private sector and govt. So I&#039;d like to think I have a unique perspective on this topic. There are some that would only consider a computer in a warehouse surrounded by a faraday cage running a heavily customized and hardened copy of openbsd &#039;secure&#039; and anything else is a joke and completely insecure. This is the type of view that kmfkewm commonly expresses. This is often the view of someone who is likely young, inexperienced in the practical application and management of secure networks but is well educated in them in the academic and/or classical sense. It&#039;s and argument like this:<br /><br />Using a 2048 bit PGP key is completely insecure because a 4096 bit key is stronger.<br /><br />So this statement is half true, in so much as the 4096 bit key is more secure (this is of course assuming all other variables are unchanged, like password length type etc) however the ideal that 2048 bits is not secure is false and reflects a failure to apply the security principles in a practical fashion.<br /><br />There are other security minded folks/professionals (I don&#039;t really do as much with security specifically now as I do with virtualization although I did author some hardening documentation) like myself that have a more targeted approach to security which is to say to identify your attackers, or who you are concerned about obtaining your data for whatever reason and focus on eliminating the gaps that exist and make those attackers job easier.<br /><br />This is to say that some believe (like kmfkewm appears to) that security is an &#039;all or nothing&#039; sort of deal and anyone doing less than them are fools and are largely unprotected. He may have a fair amount of knowledge on securing computing platforms and where vulnerabilities exist but I&#039;m of the opinion he is lacking in actual &#039;seat time&#039; managing such things and understanding what a reasonable application of security principles is and when you are simply applying restrictions for the sake of applying them and really not increasing your security in a useful fashion (read: you&#039;ve gone significantly beyond the point of diminishing returns).
