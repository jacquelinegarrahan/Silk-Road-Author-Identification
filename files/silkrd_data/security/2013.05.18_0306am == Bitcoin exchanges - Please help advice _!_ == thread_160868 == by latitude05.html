				So i use to be on MTGOX till all the crap went down with Dwolla.<br /><br />I started an account on CAMPBX.com which is a good service - HOWEVER THE PRICE of bitcoin on the exchange is around $5-6&nbsp; lower than MTGOX , <br /><br />Why is this ?<br />Is there any other exchanges anyone can recommend that is no in line with MTGOX ?<br />If I use MTGOX and need money out , can I still wire money out of it because Dawolla is down ???<br /><br />Please help appreciate it not sure what else I can do <br />&nbsp;

				Campbx values the coin very low compared to Coinbase.<br /><br />I like coinbase but when I sold a coin they automatically took the money to my account and charged me a fee for it as well as selling . I dont understand that ??? I was selling them to have money in my account to hopefully buy again when the coin was lower , is this possible ?<br /><br /><br />Also , I opened an account put coin in it and linked it to my checking and they didn&#039;t make me buy 10 coins , thats weird .<br /><br />MTGox was easy and fees were low wish they could be back up with dawolla oh well .
