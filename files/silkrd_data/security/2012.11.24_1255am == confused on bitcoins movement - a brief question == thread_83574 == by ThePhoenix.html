				ok...I am on https://www.bitinstant.com<br /><br />so if I use the option &quot;moneygram&quot; to send to &quot;bitcoin to email&quot;...do I send it to my new tormail account? and then when its in my tormail account, how do I send just part of it to a vendor? do I need to forward from my tormail account to a bit wallet? then from the bitcoin wallet, I can send to vendor?<br /><br />am I getting that correctly? if so,&nbsp; WHATS THE BEST bitcoin wallet?<br /><br />I swear this is making me feel dumb<br />any help would be appriciated<br />

				Quickest and easiest way:<br /><br />1. Go to instawallet.com then bookmark the page. <br />2. On bitinstant choose Moneygram -&gt; Bitcoin wallet, then in the bitcoin address field use the &quot;your bitcoin address&quot; from instawallet<br />3. Go to http://blockchain.info/address/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS and wait for 6 confirmations. This will take about an hour.<br />4. After an hour or so, go back to your instawallet page and send the funds to your SR address.<br />5. An hour later you can make your purchase, it should be there after 6 confirmations. (watch http://blockchain.info/address/YOUR_SR_ADDRESS)<br />6. Delete that instawallet bookmark and never use it again.<br /><br />In this case you need to trust six parties: your bank, moneygram, instawallet, bitinstant, silk road and your silk road vendor. If you&#039;re transferring a lot of funds then you should use the desktop application from bitcoin.org rather than instawallet, it&#039;s unlikely that instawallet will get hacked in the exact hour that you&#039;re trusting it for but that&#039;s a risk you can avoid by using the desktop app.<br /><br />If you&#039;re hardcore and don&#039;t want to leave a paper trail you should buy bitcoins for cash in the post from a trusted local vendor in #bitcoin-otc, with the btc going to your own secure wallet and sent from the desktop app. This way you only need to trust bitcoin-otc, your own computer, silk road and the vendor. The less people you have to trust the better!

				Thank you! Very detailed<br />why 6 confirmations?&nbsp; <br /><br />I will try this tomorrow by going to a zipzap place. That cuts out one middleman.<br />zipzap/bitinstant/installwallet ....then I contact the SR vendor<br /><br />do I contact him directly because SR vendor site is down? is that safe?<br />

On average there&#039;s a winner every 10 minutes, there are around 40,000 people playing millions of times a second converting electricity into the chance to win some bitcoins. Because there is no central authority, the ledger is more like a tree than a chain, it can branch out at any point and the longest chain is the official one. So someone could theoretically turn back the clock and cheat people by spending the same money twice, if they could create a longer chain starting in the past and reverse everyone&#039;s transactions.<br /><br />Because blocks are tied together and each block represents 10 minutes of the most powerful supercomputer on earth trying to win the lottery, the security of a transaction being undone is proportional to its depth. The default is 6 blocks which is around an hour, so to undo one transaction an attacker would need to invest about $20M in hardware and spend about a fifth of a power plant&#039;s energy for a couple of hours. So we&#039;re safe for now!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83574.msg619652#msg619652">Quote from: ThePhoenix on November 24, 2012, 02:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">do I contact him directly because SR vendor site is down? is that safe?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No. Silk Road has an escrow system for disputes, you are not protected if you send funds outside this system. Send to your silk road account and then buy through the site. Make sure the vendor/dealer you use has a good rating and do not finalize the transaction early.

				OK UPDATE<br /><br />I found that on bitinstant, I didnt click thru far enough..after the first CAPTCHA and second CAPTCHA, I saw an screen with a bunch of info..but didnt notice the Cash Deposit button in the middle...thus taking me to the page which you print with the receive code...<br /><br /><br />so its bitinstant / cash deposit (walmart) to bit address / hit submit....then hit Cash Deposit &quot;go&quot;...fill out that info and then there will be a place on that becomes active that says &quot;create payment slip&quot;<br /><br />thats what I missed<br /><br />so now I wait for the money to go in<br />
