				I have avoided uploading pictures since I learnt about meta data. Ive got a vendors account but have stupid pictures up there that were put on all vendors accounts about 4 months ago when SR came under attack. Underneath the picture it has an ewallet address for bit coins to be sent, it was some scam.<br /><br />Anyway there are two things I want to know.<br /><br />1. How can I get rid of the pictures that were put on my listed items?<br /><br />2. What is the best way to take some pictures and upload them onto my SR account avoiding meta data problems.<br /><br />

				Im not a vendor, so i dont know how to remove the old hacked photos. <br /><br />To scrub meta data, you can either down load and use a scrubber, like jpeg scrubber, or you can take a screen shot of the pic when its open on your screen.&nbsp; Crop and edit it, save it through the paint program, and all the meta data will be gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;I like to do both as a extra precaution, and because im OCD. Good luck.

				Good thinking Batman I should have done that.<br /><br />I need to drum up business. I didnt need to advertise before, I got a load of regular customers and enough new ones not to worry about it, it just slowly grows. I stopped sending things out for like 6 weeks or something and now Ive lost all the customers I used to have so now Ive got to advertise more.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip. I sell different types of hash both cheap stuff and high quality stuff, if you ever order remind me we talked here and I&#039;ll remember it and sort you a better deal out.

				if you use linux then exiftool is great.&nbsp; tails also has it already installed.<br />in terminal type&nbsp; exiftool -all= *.jpg&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and it will strip all the data out of every .jpg in that folder.&nbsp; nice for multiple images.&nbsp; it will also make a copy of each image.&nbsp; secure erease is another neat tool to over write your data to help hide anything was ever there.&nbsp; &nbsp;srm *.jpg*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will erase them all :)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i should note secure erasing works differently on usb flash and ssd)<br /><br />as for erasing your hacked photo from your vendor page I dont see an option to erase a picture, only option is to simply replace it with a new one or maybe contact vendor support.<br />good luck guys<br />

				Check out ObscuraCam. It&#039;s an app for your Iphone or Android. It removes all the exif and meta data shit, and the people from Tor promote it.

				Like someone said earlier, if you use tails there is an application included in the bundle that helps you with this. Go to Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit. This is very easy to use as you just add files into the list, click &quot;Clean&quot;, and let the application do the rest. New files will be created but you can simply remove the old files. This is especially important if you use a smartphone camera as most of the current ones tend to include geolocation, which is probably among the worst giveaways.
