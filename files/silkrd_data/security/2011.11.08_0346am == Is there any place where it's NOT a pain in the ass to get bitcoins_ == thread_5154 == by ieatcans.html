				Every place I&#039;ve found wants me to set up an account, then set up another account, then transfer the money to another account and keep a balance on all the accounts and wait weeks and weeks and it&#039;s expensive and bulky and time consuming and risky and by all accounts a massive pain in the ass.&nbsp; I just want to buy some bitcoins with my credit card or paypal so I can get some shit from this site.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				Get-Bitcoin [ get-bitcoin.com/home/faq ] seems to be where most people end up.&nbsp; No Paypal or CC, five percent purchase fee.&nbsp; You can overnight cash to them if you like.<br /><br />Otherwise you can look on SR to find some one willing to accept a pre-paid card of some type or other.&nbsp; The chances of being scammed would be substantially higher in that case, IMO.&nbsp; That&#039;s the price you (may) pay if you want your coins quick and easy.

				There&#039;s bitcoin-otc.com - they use PGP+IRC and a trust/ranking system, always use caution and check ratings, but you can buy BTC with Paypal / moneypak etc. there. It&#039;s peer-to-peer, no central/escrow system, and quite a bit of scam as I understand. But a very nice community as well :)

				I had a similar question that I just posted: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5280.0<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read, sending them through a few instawallets after purchasing from get-bitcoin seems like a good way to go (though if anyone with experience has different advice, I&#039;d be happy to listen :) )

				I like instawallets, but there are those who prefer keeping on Desktop, in wallet, and then you can save wallet.dat on dropbox or wuala or elsewhere online, so if your harddrive goes bad...plus if you want to encrypt and save....but aside from all that...I like to keep it online, and to keep it simple, so for me, yes, instawallet.org, no matter where I start, I send it there first, then maybe split it up into two packets sent to other instawallet, then on to SR...and on return trip, if there is one, same thing....&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m big on keeping stuff online, rather than on my pc...I like using Tails, keeping my passwords/url&#039;s/usernames in a file online, another file keeps pgp public keys.&nbsp; Open Tails, get updates, install keepassx, get my files....run around TOR for awhile, stash any new stuff in online files, and then when I&#039;m gone, the flash is all erased...keep it in the cloud...I can access anywhere I can use a flash drive...

				My technique is not too bad. It takes about 4 business days, and has minimal fees. Here is what you would do to mimic my process:<br /><br />1. Open an account with DWOLLA.COM and link an actual checking account to it. Transferring funds from your account to DWOLLA takes about 4 business days (they say 2 to 3 but it&#039;s almost always 4)<br />2. Open an account with campbx.com, they can link directly to DWOLLA and transfer funds from 1 to the other in hours.<br />3. Buy your BTC at campbx (zero wait time if you pay market price)<br />4. Transfer your BTC to your SR wallet address<br /><br />TA-DA, BTC&#039;s in less than a week. Not too bad. Like others here said, you can go buy a Money Pak (+$5) then go to a reputable MP to BTC exchange service on the road (BTW, SumYunGai is legit, I used him once and he sent me my BTC&#039;s for my MP in less than 1 hour) resulting in more fees, and paying BTC value&nbsp; + roughly 25% for them. Or you can go on eBay and pay $7 per BTC (IE get butt raped).&nbsp; So it seems that if you really can&#039;t be patient and wait 4 days for the DWOLLA transfer, there&#039;s no way to acquire BTC immediately without over-paying &amp; taking it in the poop shute, LoL.

				Try CampBX. You can send a check or money order. No ID required. Further, they have an excellent Trading system where you can actually use this current Volatility to Cash in cause they allow you to Short Bitcoins, Go Long BC&#039;s as well as buy on Margin. I purchased an Option for cheap there and Shorted 100 BC&#039;s at 2.25. I essentially made the equivalent of a fat 1oz of Kush Weed by using the available resources they have there.

				Is all the concern over acquiring BTC anonymously just hedging bets?<br /><br />I was to understand that bitcoin transfers are theoretically untraceable. So if I pick up some using direct means (like a paypal or something else easily traceable), once I tumble them myself through a few services, how is that traceable to me?

				My first time buying BTC I used the Dwolla process, it did take 3-4 business days for my cash to clear, but after that it was was fairly easy process going from Dwolla -&gt; Tradehill -&gt; etc.<br /><br />I recently used get-bitcoin.com cash deposit at BoA and it took about 4 1/2 hours for them to email me back saying my BTCs were in transit to my Tradehill, then another hour or two to actually receive them.
