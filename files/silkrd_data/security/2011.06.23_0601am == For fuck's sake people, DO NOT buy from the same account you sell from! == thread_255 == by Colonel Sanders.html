				I have another account that I sell under.<br /><br />To my utter horror, I have already had a few people buy from me who sell with the same account.<br /><br />People...&nbsp; Make a separate account for buying.&nbsp; Sellers are the ones who law enforcement will want to bust most, and buying with your seller account and giving your address to ANYONE is a horrible idea.<br /><br />MAKE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT.

				Even if you use drop addresses, you are still tipping LE off about locations where you could be.

				Yep. I have never bought anything from SR yet but I do have an extra account just for this purpose in case anything I want pops up.

				Excellent advice, and in keeping with my notion that because so many of us on here are geeks, or at least semi-computer literate, we get all excited about the middle digital stuff: the TOR, VM, and GPG goodies, that we loose site of common sense, and either telegraph our pursuits to others thru bragging accompanied by alcohol, or some seller gets cracked for something unrelated, and decides to try to bargain his way out by giving up a handful of buyers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or we just don&#039;t pay attention to the two guys hanging around our pickup spot...or just get nailed thru bad packaging....and since it appears most people on here aren&#039;t hardened tough guys, you&#039;d better expect they&#039;ll talk if they get caught.&nbsp; <br /><br />The genius of this site notwithstanding, we gotta be xtra careful, same as if we were picking up in east harlem in the bad old days...just because I initiate this in front of a keyboard and screen, doesn&#039;t make it any safer than a hand to hand in a bad neighborhood.

				This got me thinking. Having one buyer account per purchase would be more secure still, since it wouldn&#039;t inform the seller of all the buyer&#039;s other transactions. Is there even an advantage to having buyer accounts at all? Does buyer feedback mean anything if the payment is always sure? Why not just have purchases made without logging in, and accounts only used for selling? That way if a buyer is identified there will be no way to connect him with his sellers. But I&#039;m not clear how feedback even works, what prevents people from selling to themselves through multiple accounts. On ebay this is done by making it hard to register anonymously, but there is no such constraint here. I suppose this is what got the seller registration closed, but I don&#039;t see how that helps since being able to give feedback to oneself effectively makes feedback meaningless for everyone, including the sellers already here. I&#039;m new here though, I&#039;ll go look for answers.<br /><br />EDIT: I found a discussion of preventing self-applied feedback under &quot;Proposal for Feedback Authenticity Rating&quot; here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=212.0<br /><br />This looks like the best that be done, except maybe adding a way for members to vouch for each other as part of the integrity system.
