				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to upgrade my current laptop, and had a few questions about staying anonymous:<br /><br />1. What is the most secure OS for browsing SR? I&#039;ve heard good thing about TAILS and Whonix, but what about Linux Mint or Ubuntu? I may just install Linux Mint as host OS and then a live USB for SR activity.<br /><br />2. If I purchase a laptop from Amazon, meaning it can easily be traced to me, is there any way to change that? I was thinking of reformatting its SSD, and then installing Linux Mint.<br /><br />3. I was attempting to create a TAILS 0.20 bootable USB by using a DVD, and then cloning to a USB. I managed to do both these steps, but when I tried to boot the live USB on a Windows 8 laptop (that&#039;s now currently Win7), it didn&#039;t detect the USB in the BIOS, and it said &quot;Operation system not found&quot; when I pressed &quot;ESC&quot; on the TrueCrypt screen. I then tried it on another laptop (3-4 year old one) and it worked perfectly. Does TAILS not work on Windows 8? I searched high and low for answers, but there&#039;s not much helpful information on this.<br /><br />4. Can someone briefly explain what the &quot;persistence&quot; on TAILS is? Does it create an encrypted storage space on the USB? How do you put your desired files in this persistence space? What programs do you recommend putting the persistence folder (there were ~10 options when I got to this part such as Claws Mail, etc)?<br /><br />5. Will the &quot;autonuke&quot; command on DBAN be sufficient to COMPLETELY overwrite all sectors on my SSD? I&#039;ll be selling this laptop, and I want to make sure there&#039;s no way for the data to be resurrected.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to becoming an active member in the community, but I want to make I&#039;m 99% secure before I plant my feet here. Thanks all!

				For the overly paranoid: One interesting feature of SSDs is that they rely on NAND storage, which is basically a huge collection of gates.&nbsp; &nbsp;And those gates fail eventually.&nbsp; So the SSD marks the blocks as bad blocks.&nbsp; No biggie, because we never see that happening behind the scenes.&nbsp; We just use other parts of the disk and never notice the difference.<br /><br />But once those blocks are marked as bad, they&#039;re almost impossible to access.&nbsp; If you wipe the SSD, you&#039;re probably not wiping the blocks of storage marked as bad.&nbsp; So you&#039;ve cleaned the disk, but the data that was on those storage blocks when they were marked &quot;bad&quot; is now there forever.<br /><br />The only good news is that, currently, most forensic tools won&#039;t read them properly either.

				Thanks for the responses. I just have a few last questions:<br /><br />1. Where is the persistence folder located on TAILS after you configure it?<br /><br />2. What&#039;s a secure way to erase/overwrite data on a SSD?

				Harddrives are cheap as hell, why don&#039;t you buy one specifically for SR? You are worried about selling it right? Do you sanitation and then physically destroy the drive. Call it an investment in your security.

				One other thought:&nbsp; If you use full disk encryption on SSD devices from Day One, wiping it becomes a non-issue because it&#039;s never seen unencrypted data.&nbsp; Who cares what gets left on it? Just give it a pass or two and call it good.<br /><br />The problem comes in when you&#039;ve used it unencrypted and you&#039;re afraid it still has unencrypted data on it.<br />
