				Clearnet warning: http://blog.bitinstant.com/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quick update – we’re turning off our cash deposits until late Friday (Dec. 7). We apologize for the inconvenience this causes, but we need to fix some processing errors that have been causing problems for customers today.<br /><br />If you already have a cash deposit payment slip, feel free to complete the order as normal, we’re just halting the creation of any new cash deposits. We’ll update this post tomorrow when the deposits are turned back on.<br /><br />Thank you very much for your patience!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So it looks like cash deposits will be back and working again tomorrow night. I will breathe a little easier now. I got the worst feeling that cash deposits would never be back...

				I have a feeling that cash deposits arent gonna ever return to the functionality they once had.<br /><br />I was an avid online sport bettor for a few years ... as the DOJ started cracking down on forms of deposits these sorts of on and off starts and stops would happen with certain methods before they were shut down for good.<br /><br />BitInstant must be processing something like $40-50k per day in cash at its heights ... the DOJ is going to link that to SR and to drug buying and shut it down within the next 2-3 months for good I think.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I figured would happen eventually. As of right, cash deposits are back on and working at Bitinstant. But I have a feeling that you&#039;re right, and we will see the end of cash deposits sooner rather than later. I hope that we are wrong.
