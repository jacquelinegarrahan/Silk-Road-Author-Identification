				I am looking for a safe, reliable, un-traceable way of buying bitcoins in America.<br /><br />Does anyone have any experiance and more importantly good results with using any specific sites or services?<br /><br />I have the potential of putting money onto a debit card, but i would REALLY prefer not to, no matter how secure a <br />site says they are any link back to me is bad. So is there a way to buy something with cash at a place like walmart<br />or 7-11 or something, for example a prepaid credit card, and then use that card to do it electronically.<br /><br />I would do the cash in the mail, but i know that can get intercepted easily, and if i ever start dealing with large quantities of money that just wouldn&#039;t be safe.<br /><br />Any guides / links would be great.

				there are posts already detailing ways to do this.....do a search and read up on it first and then ask any questions you may have.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are ways to do it with moneypak or check out exchangebitcoins.com&nbsp; <br />That should get you started at least.

				exchangebitcoins.com located in Redwood City CA is reliable. Go there and create an account and then read their Deposits page. You can simply mail them a US Postal Money order which they will credit to your account and begin purchasing bitcoins.

				If you live near a Bank of America or a Wells Fargo, you can use their direct deposit option for quickest results.&nbsp; I really encourage all US based users to use this method.

				I understand it&#039;s faster and more secure then sending it in the mail. But the fact that i have to go into the bank and that they could see my face and have it on record is not an option i&#039;m willing to partake in right now.

Use one in a fairly high traffic area, just in case :)
