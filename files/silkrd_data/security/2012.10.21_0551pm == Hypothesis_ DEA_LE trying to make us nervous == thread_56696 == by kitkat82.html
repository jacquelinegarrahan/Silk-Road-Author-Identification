				Ok, so I am noticing a LOT of posts about people who have ordered for personal use having scares/getting letters/seeing cops following them/other suspicious things.<br /><br />Some of these posts are probably true, but I am starting to think that this is LE trying to make us paranoid and think that they know more than they really do.&nbsp; If they can convince people that they are on to us, once they do make a bust they can get them to tell them everything they know.<br /><br />Just a thought.&nbsp; It is really strange to me to see so many posts about controlled deliveries and stuff from people who are not regular contributors or are new to this board.

				probably some of them are LE fear mongering, but I know for sure that at least a few people who ordered from TFM have received letters.

				I agree that the TFM letters are genuine.&nbsp; I do suspect that a big reason for sending the letters was in the hopes that recipients would come to forums like this one and post about it.

				First post so sorry if I&#039;m out of line...I think kmfkewm is more on target with the fear mongering theory.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m naive but it would seem like a lot of work for LE to target personal use.&nbsp; Just my two cent theory.&nbsp; Not saying you should throw caution to the wind, but I agree with all of the security measures I&#039;ve seen on here<br /><br />
