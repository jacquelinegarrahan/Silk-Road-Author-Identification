				Hey guys, I need help with this &quot;problem&quot; I got. On Friday and Saturday (these past 2 days) I made multiple deposits on bitstant. These deposit slips are still valid for a few more days. One is still valid until&nbsp; the 12th. However both of those deposits didnt go through.&nbsp; <br /><br />First deposit didn&#039;t work out because I tried to deposit it through Chase lol.<br /><br />Second one im not sure why it didnt work out, i&#039;m thinking cos I went to a different CVS then the one I selected online to &quot;pay here&quot;<br /><br />My following questions are:<br /><br />1. I wanna make a new order tomorrow. Do I have to wait until my previous 2 deposits expire to make a new deposit? <br /><br />2. Or do I have to select another deposit location since the CVS where I WANT to make my deposit at still has my pending orders in there system?<br /><br />Appreciate all feedback n thanks for taking the time to read.<br /><br />

				Not sure about #1, but I don&#039;t see why you would need to wait. I made several &quot;test&quot; slips on the day I tried it for the first time and I didn&#039;t have any issues.<br /><br />#2, if it&#039;s for Moneygram, selecting a location doesn&#039;t seem to matter in my experience. It&#039;s just for your convenience. FYI, Wal-mart, IMHO is the most convenient place to do Moneygrams for Bitinstant.

				Thanks for clearing that out dogg, and yes my second attempt was a moneygram. <br /><br />Can anyone else clarify?

				I don&#039;t think you have to wait for the other orders to expire.&nbsp; Just deposit a slightly different amount (which I&#039;m sure is one way that they track transactions).&nbsp; And it shouldn&#039;t matter which location... whichever you prefer.

				you have to deposit the correct amount at the correct place ime for them to know who deposited the money<br /><br />are you saying you gave the bank AND cvs money without receiving anything?<br /><br />if you deposited it into the wrong bank and account then they didnt receive the money and i think you may be out of luck<br /><br />but for cvs if you deposited the correct amount just at the wrong location you need to contact them and let them know you used a different one. then your account will be credited<br /><br />i dont recommend you try again until you actually get the first cvs deposit figured&nbsp; so you know what youre doing<br /><br />if you do want to make another deposit just make sure you deposit the exact amount at the correct place

				It turns out moneygram at the CVS I went to wasn&#039;t working correctly. Then I tried bitinstant - direct cash bank deposit (boa) - instawallet - silkroad. Had my order placed 2 hours later :D. <br />Thanks for that info micro.

				What I did:<br /><br />Bitinstant local bank (Bank of America) to BTC address (online wallet).<br /><br />I had BTC in my wallet before I could drive home.<br /><br />No signature required, no questions.
