				I would suggest to not use too many different tor bridges. Maybe two or three, or even just one is enough, because your tor traffic will not go through all of these bridges. Tor will select one of them and use it as your entry node.&nbsp; I think tor will always first try to connect to the bridge that is first in line, and if it is down then connect to the next and so on. In that case it would not be of a big problem, but if we assume that tor selects a different on every start, it will actually become more likely to see that you are using tor since if they know only one of the bridges you ever connect to you are &quot;flagged&quot;.<br />

I would choose four or five, and if I still had trouble I would delete tose and try another group of four or five until I hit a good batch. I also found that I needed the delete and repopulate with new bridges the list every few days, as some TOR bridges are only open when that use is logged in to TOR.
