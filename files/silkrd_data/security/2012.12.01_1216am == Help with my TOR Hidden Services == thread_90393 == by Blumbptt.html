				&nbsp;:)<br />I&#039;m going to be creating a website that has 3d-cart, for the store (or any reccomendations on other 3d-cart similar domains that work directly with bitcoin?). SimpleMachines.org for the forum, and maybe enom.com for the seperate vendor web pages. What are some good regular domain building sites similar to enom.com who fucked me over 20 bucks for a website i tried creating topnotchreceptors.com, which sold a special satellite that has the ability to pick up and receive all signals from ALL of the commercial media based satellites which is about 160 satellites and every country. Over 8,000 channels of every kind, and a receiver with a toggel so you can hook your satellite up to a computer and do some ethical hacking. And a DVD recorder for anything on the services. It isn&#039;t legal but enom.com never gave me the time of day to start my would have been pretty successfull webpage. <br />Anyways, I will put that product up in the electronics section here and see if I can make a little page with pictures and the different bandwidth receptors that they provide...<br />Anyways, I need to create a underground Onion site. Firstly, I figured if I do this I&#039;m going to need the right best Server for my needs. I heard Servant or Serpent Servers are the way to go; as Apache Servers have glitches in which may reveal your ID. I need a server with enough storage for my traffic, I also need one that goes good with TOR, VPN, And Proxy Chains and Encryption of course. I want all my information to all be mine and only mine and I want the same for the people who join my forum, &quot;invite only.&quot;<br />What&#039;s a good number to call or website to pay for a VPN if that&#039;s necessary? Also are there any good proxy chains websites? and any other programs like TOR which may be good to have running as a secondary to fill in the glitches...?<br />I don&#039;t want to pay too much for the server so I think it&#039;d be best to build one on my own unless there&#039;s one in particular anyone can think of on the top of their heads that meets most of my needs almost and it&#039;s already one piece?<br />Anyone know how to answer these questions as they just come as I go? links, reviews, etc...<br />I cannot get arrested and so far this laptop i&#039;m using has been nothing but anonymous, haven&#039;t even used my facebook so I&#039;ll be on here buying drugs and electronics and learning more about bitcoin and advanced web design and security.<br /><br />I am looking for Web designers/Web Developers with specialties in IT and traffic analysis.&nbsp; I also am looking for hackers to find glitches in my site and to teach me how to use AdWords the right way ;) jk maybe pay per click professionals<br />So I am recruiting hosting, designers, people who are interested in joining for invites.<br />My site will specialize in anything and everything you could possibly think of, our goal is to gather as much governmental software and hardware and underground news world wide. Conspiracy theories, the Illuminati and secret societies and weather modification amongst many others. I also have a wholesale deal with everything hewlett packard. Cheap Dells (New and Old), some IBMs for the cheapest we can get &lt;ALL BEST QUALITY OR NEW BTW....&gt; Encrypted multi signal multi number cell phones, encrypted flip phones for 1-10 uses with unlimited minutes. Secrets will be on the forum like how to call 611 from any verizon phone and receive service unlimited lifetime service for free. we will have fire arms, and maybe fire arms licenses. /which i think we may send in parts instead of sending heat in whole...<br /><br />Also, I saw an add on google for an absolutely free internet service, I wrote it down somewhere. Would it be safer to get a less popular free internet service\?<br />And does anyone knkow how to get high speed wireless internet for free monthly PM me please I&#039;m cool. I&#039;m fuckin Blumbptt outta my fucking dome peace (&gt;-)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;;)&nbsp; :D

				Also, I heard somewhere reliable that www.I2P.de was a reputable TOR like program which covers IP hiding in IRC Networks which TOR doesn&#039;t cover your ip all the time in.<br />But I went to www.I2P.de which i am absolutely positive is the url and its a german site so I do not comprehend one word on that site and cant make out where the download link is. Anyone know of an add-on I can download onto my tor browser thats good at translating sites?<br />Sum 1 should translate that site and check out the open source tor like....<br />Although i&#039;m almost absolutely sold to the idea of using simplemachines forums, if I could have babylon translator for more than the 30 day trial, i might even go http://www.staff.forumup.nl which is a nice forum display its just in another language, I could have my site listed in there under the name klike &quot;Library&quot; &quot;Book Club&quot; &quot;Shoe Store&quot; in the german language. itll be hidden and you wont need tor until you get invited so you can find it within the ForumUp netherlands database which is huge.<br />Anyone ever work or hear of forumup.com?<br />also, is vBulletin worth the fee&gt;?<br />thepiponline2.com was jelsoft enterprises brought out by vBulletin which charges a monthly fee... jelsoft enterprises now has a forum up called theadminzone.com which is a HUGE site made specifically from forum administrators. Its great.<br />also, how do you make money as an admin of a nice big black market website? Commissions? Can someone tell me exactly how that works&gt;?<br />Silk Road grossed $22 Million dollars in one year.<br /><br />oh right i forgot to mention that the site i have is also probably gonna be one of the hottest escort services on the net using a combination of the top escort services ive come across.<br />how do i earn my money though? and everttg8ugbNG else

				you already gave away so much intel that there&#039;s no point in setting up a hidden service. for the record, Virtual Bulletin is complete shit, it was taken over by Internet Brands and then all the original developers fled to go start a new company, and now they&#039;re all suing each other.<br /><br />Internet Brands bans customers from their forums and nulls their software or denies updates if they criticize them on their forums. It&#039;s the biggest piece of shit douche company going since steve-o ballmar ran microsoft and Vbulletin &#039;suite&#039; is full of 0day potential.<br /><br />you only use open source software for a tor hidden service, and there&#039;s a million other things you need to do. you also don&#039;t recruit on FBI watched boards for employees, that&#039;s a guaranteed way to end up in jail. expect everybody who pm&#039;s you offering to help is a fed because that&#039;s exactly what i would do as a fed<br /><br />
