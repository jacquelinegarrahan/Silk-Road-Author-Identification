				Earlier this morning I went to CVS to do the MoneyGram BTC option.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used it a couple times before without any trouble so I wasn&#039;t expecting any this time.&nbsp; I printed out my ZipZap slip last night (using fake information which corresponds to a fake ID that I have) and got cash together. <br /><br />Went into CVS this morning and got on the red phone, which went fine.&nbsp; Then I went up to the counter to pay and it was some newbie cashier who had no idea what he was doing.&nbsp; The manger had to come show him and the manager was super pissed off.&nbsp; First thing he did was ask for my ID and I gave him the fake one that matches my info.&nbsp; The transaction went fine, gave him money, etc... then when a receipt usually pops out, the screen said &quot;Error.&nbsp; Call MoneyGram.&quot; <br /><br />The already pissy manager grabbed a phone and called the number.&nbsp; They told her to try again, but the same thing happened.&nbsp; The person on the phone said this kind of an error was likely due to an issue on the receiving end (aka ZipZap) and said I could try again in 15 minutes if I wanted to.&nbsp; not wanting to stay, I grabbed my money back and booked it out of that store.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, what happened?&nbsp; Did ZipZap cancel my order for some reason or what?&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on going to another CVS or MoneyGram place and trying again tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Should I re-use the same ZipZap slip or get a new one?<br /><br />I also think I should add that I (possibly dumbly) used the same email address and fake phone number on this Bitinstant order as I did the last one.&nbsp; Bad idea?

				I doubt bitinstant cancelled your order, I have hear there servers have been swarmed as of late, so CVS might have been unable to connect. I would go back to a different CVS at a later time (if memory serves you should be able to you any CVS in the area of the original without a problem, you might want to double check that with zipzap though).<br /><br />As far as the same email, doubt that will be a problem unless that email gets tied to something illegal, and I have never received a call from bitinstant regarding an order so I doubt the phone num will be an issue.

				same thing happened to me a few days ago. The cashier got an error message, I went to a different cvs and the moneygram agent on the phone told me zipzap&#039;s servers were down. I called moneygram and they said they are fine, I called zipzap they said their servers were up all day. So the next day I made a new payment slip and it worked. <br />I would just create a new payment slip and try again. Make sure the cashier enters the total amount with the fee. <br />Most cashiers at cvs dont do moneygrams often and I basically do it for them on their computer.

				I have tried CVS twice and 7-11 once and will never even try to use either of them again - really don&#039;t know why Bitinstant continues to list CVS as a means of sending money because it never works.&nbsp; Twice I was told that they don&#039;t or can&#039;t send &quot;the kind of money&quot; that I want to send, whatever that means.&nbsp; And the clerks get so pissed off, it&#039;s like there was some internal CVS memo circulated saying that if anyone comes into the store with a ZipZap transaction that they / we are criminals.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just go to Walmart - I use 3 different Walmarts to mix it up.&nbsp; Try to go late on Friday afternoon when all of the peeps without checking accounts show up to cash paychecks and wire money home. Wear crummy clothes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had any problem at Walmart, if the clerk asks just tell them that you are paying a bill.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Walmart Money Centers in my area are open until 9 at night. Good luck!

				The CVS in my area requires ID. Does Walmart? I don&#039;t even want to try. There is something about that &quot;in person interaction&quot; that throws me off.

				Yea, failed twice in a row at CVS, the cashier said she does a lot of moneygrams, and the system must be down. Went down the road to Walmart. They didn&#039;t ask for an ID, CVS did.

This might be a regional thing, but the 7-11 I go to keeps the cashier totally out of the loop. It&#039;s just a kiosk with a phone. Just have to pick it up, give them the transaction and kiosk numbers, and then you can feed the cash right into the machine. No ID needed, and no face to face interaction at all.
