				Well, what is the difference between them and which one do you prefer? If you know other laudering/mixing service which works with a different scheme, please post here and explain it.<br /><br />And what about blind bitcoins? Yeah, I know it is off, but what was his method (and the difference between bitlaundry and bitcoinfog)?

				You could transfer between different instawallets (instawallet.org) before transferring to Mt. Gox, etc. but bookmark the urls they provide. Or, if you have an anonymous account with a tormail address set up at one of the exchanges you can pretty safely send bc right to your SR account right from the exchange.

				Using both services would be expensive and costs would be transferred to your buyers. This just make sense if they use different scheme to mix and laundry your coins. Are they different or not?<br /><br />And what about the dead &quot;blind bitcoin&quot;? How they used to work?

				Both of these mixes are the same type, the only (potential) difference is who runs them. I would go with the one that gets more traffic since that will increase your anonymity.

				Would a bitcoin casino serve the same purpose as a mixer?<br />Question 2... are there any popularly used BTC casinos?

				Thanks for the answers. Uau, Tony didn&#039;t use any laundry service. Bad option for a big seller as he used to be.
