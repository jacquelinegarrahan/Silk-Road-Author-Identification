				It depends on whether you were under surveillance at the time you did this.&nbsp; If you were, you revealed your true identity assuming that your Facebook and/or email could be linked to you which very likely they could.

				i guess its hard to define surveillance as there is potential risk for individuals to be associated to the site where exit nodes can be revealed, monitored and recorded (if i understand correctly).&nbsp; of course becoming more transparent through the use of email and fbook is not a good thing.&nbsp; assuming active surveillance is not in action how does the ip address and the association to tor and or exit nodes become problematic?&nbsp; assuming that isp will never delete logs then if something goes down in the future old logs will present issues assured.&nbsp; &nbsp;if no issue occurs then what becomes of this information?<br />

				Unless you are currently under investigation I don&#039;t think you have much to worry about. Even then I think they could only see that you connected to the tor network. That doesn&#039;t mean they can see what you did on tor as it is end to end encryption.<br /><br />Unless you have done something to bring a lot of attention to yourself I wouldn&#039;t worry too much for the one slip. <br /><br />I know it isn&#039;t practical to use tor for everything but don&#039;t only use it for SR. <br /><br />I would atleaast use a vpn for clearnet stuff when tor isn&#039;t an option. Especially for Facebook.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				As Horblower said unless you opened a site that ID&#039;s you with TorBrowser or a browser that was configured to use TOR you are just fine. You can check this by starting TOR, waiting for the torcheck page to tell you that you are in fact using TOR, and then open another non-TorBrowser and navigating to the same torcheck page. It should tell you are not using TOR.<br /><br />oxyhoot

				Using a browser like you usually do at the same time as you&#039;re using the Tor browser to look at Silk Road is generally okay.&nbsp; It does, however, make it easier to perform certain identifying attacks against you -- those attacks are based on statistical patterns when you have a view of a large portion of a given network (like a large ISP might), as well as access to all the data traveling through the network at any given time.<br /><br />These attacks are very complex and difficult to perform, and it&#039;s extremely unlikely that anyone would bother just to bust you with a gram of cocaine or whatever your individual pleasure happens to be.<br /><br />Basically, don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a vendor or otherwise a person of interest, however, you probably want to avoid this.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re just buying stuff, it&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br />
