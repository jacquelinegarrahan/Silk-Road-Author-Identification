You are right to be suspicious of .doc files as they can be malicious.<br /><br />We have verified that this .doc file is clean and it is being hosted on cryptome.org - a very famous leak site which outdates wikileaks by several years and is run by a civil rights hero (in my humble opinion) named John Young.<br /><br /><br />You are also correct in not trusting links from random strangers who may have a motive to entrap you. +1 to you, sir.<br /><br /><br />Pastebin has a limit of 500kb. In raw text the file is just over 1MB. I would post it as an attachment here but theres an upload limit of 192KB attachments.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hmm.. I just found this paste bin alternitive called &quot;ZeroBin&quot;.. it seams to have let me paste to their site.<br /><br />Cool little service. This is what the page says: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ZeroBin is a minimalist, opensource online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. Data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256 bits AES. More information on the project page.<br />▶ Note: This is a test service: Data may be deleted anytime. Kittens will die if you abuse this service.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />ANYWAYS. Here is the file in plain text format hosted at this ZeroBin site. Tor on over there and grab the text. My fellow crazy moose riding canucks; you really really REALLY need to see this book.<br /><br />Long url:<br />http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?937236cc7e99b36c#Pc5Y9LqXVRExieNt3lBrDexT0Spr51BI5b894eJ3URY=<br /><br />Shortened&nbsp; url:<br />http://snipurl.com/255b8g9<br /><br /><br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to host it? Ill post it anywhere you want, really. It&#039;s been public domain for like 3 years on cryptome.. Before that it was just kind of floating around the underground.<br /><br />It is an older document but it is useful in showing the scope of an investigation and the angles they use in different scenarios. I like how its written in real laymans terms so even the dumbest cop can understand the chapters and sections.<br /><br />It does cite case law in it which might be useful, but it is dated so I wouldnt rely on any of the cases they use as examples in the book.<br />

				we should always be paranoid when someone is offering up a file to the members of SR.&nbsp; especially when that file is &quot;highly recommended&quot; to vendors, and even moreso when that file is in regards to ways to keep us safe.&nbsp; then we have that it is hosted on a well known leak site, which could very well be what LE would do (host it on a leak site as &quot;proof&quot; that it is safe).<br /><br />now, i&#039;m not saying that is the case here...just that i, most certainly, am not technical enough to be able to confirm the validity of the file and whether or not it&#039;s safe and that people should never download a file that hasnt been confirmed as being safe by one of our well known, resident techs.<br /><br />i&#039;m not sure why your OP was cut short, i&#039;ve never run into character limits in the coke thread...and i&#039;ve gotten up to around 18k chars in 1 post.<br /><br />anyway, i&#039;ll still wait for some more responses before i read it<br />

				Well, I downloaded it and took a look. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, this file is nothing more than a flat text file and an informative one at that, if not a bit long. It&#039;s actually 384 pages and describes itself as a book. Admittedly I did not read it all but did look at quite a few sections. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor. I&#039;m a fairly law-abiding citizen of the Dominion. I&#039;m just a dude that likes to smoke a little every now and then. My threat level to society is zero and I think that ultimately my government knows this. It is however eye opening to read the policing tactics laid out by Steve Sherriff, the author of the doc. I don&#039;t think anyone here on this forum expects that the cops have our best interests at heart. They are a government organization with a job to do and this document lay&#039;s out tactics (sometimes brutal) on how to extract confessions and then convict a person based on those confessions. It comes across as somewhat wicked, psychopathic, obsessive and finally damaging to those who undergo this process. On one hand, they&#039;ve got my grudging respect only due the thoroughness and single mindedness of achieving the objective - if I really needed to have something, I would want these guys on my side. They aren&#039;t counselors or therapists and they are prepared to do whatever it takes to convict.<br />

I fucking hate the pigs and want everyone here at SR to be as informed as possible.<br /><br /><br />Also, do a lil digging on cryptome. John only publishes things that are legit and virus free (with the exception of the stuxnet source code analysis - that&#039;s on his site for informational purposes)<br /><br /><br />Theres no way i&#039;d be able to fit the whole book in a single post.<br /><br />I hope this has been helpful to everyone<br /><br />-FTP101

				Yes, fuckthepolice101 really did deliver.<br />&nbsp;<br />I find it funny and also prudent that so there was so much concern around whether this link/file was safe. Although I&#039;m somewhat new here, I still can&#039;t really conceive the thought of the cops kicking my door in and arresting me for smokin&#039; pot. The fact that we&#039;re really interested in this document would make a really good logical target for LE to phish us out on. .. not to add to any kind of paranoia that may previously exist on the forum of a site that openly deals in illegal substances ... ya know .. just sayin&#039;

My heros include staff that run this site and all the venders. When I post a document it will usually be on a well known site.<br /><br /><br />With that being said, I could see LE doing something very similar to this. Here is what they might try to do:<br /><br />They might link you to a website that requires you to run java or javascript or flash or some plugin. They might also try to coarse you to download a file from clearnet using regular old firefox or whatever. The pluins/java apps/file or whatever may not even be malicious at all. Their goal would most likely be to get your real IP address.<br /><br />Based on your real IP address they would not be able to determine much besides your real IP address, but this could be a really bad thing if you are a vender.<br /><br /><br />I dont think they&#039;d use malwre to attack us at first. Their first goal most likely would indeed be figuring out what our real IP address is.<br /><br /><br />By using a .DOC file or a .PDF file they could also obtain your IP address by making the document fetch online data.<br /><br />By phishing like this they could find as little as possible users on SR Forums to at worst, identifying the real IP of a vender or staff member if they&#039;ve been fooled into opening a boobytrapped .doc or .pdf file.<br /><br /><br /><br />These are things we must watch out for! And good for you, rem0ved, for being suspicious!
