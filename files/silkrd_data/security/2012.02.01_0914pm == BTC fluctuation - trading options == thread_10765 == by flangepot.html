				hi all, relatively new to this but on preliminary examination of bitcoin currency, there seems to be (not in the last couple days) some quite considerable fluctuation in btc value. with the maximum BTC still not in circulation yet, is there an opportinity for investing in BTC? not talking huge amounts, dont think i can purchase thoise 19 million BTC that will be the maximum in circulation, but on a small level, ive noticed the rates rajge from between $2 - $8, sometimes more. do peoiple trade in this way? i know this is not the SR purpose, as prices are linked to the $ and quite rightly, so that prices remain in line with real costs, just wondering if folks are thinking of buying low,, then when the price fluctuates selling at the higher rate. I wouldnt bet the house but $100 - $200 dollars whn the price apperas low, and keep hold of the btc in my account ( my problem is the variety of goods on offer im not actually sure i can keep hold of them in my account for long enouhg) theh sell when the price goes up . it is a gamble but the fluctaution in rates always levels out in the end, if it goes up, its certain to go back down .... what are folks thoughts?

I make BTC purchases when BTC prices are low. Then I slowly use up my BTC while the price is on the rise...
