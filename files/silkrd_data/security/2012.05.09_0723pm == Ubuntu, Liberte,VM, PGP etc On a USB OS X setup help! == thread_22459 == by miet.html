				Hey, everyone I&#039;ve done some searches but can&#039;t quite find what I&#039;m looking for and tried some thing that haven&#039;t really worked.<br /><br />I&#039;m a noob looking to set-up a secure solution for SR/Darkweb using OS X. I have both an intel iMac running lion and a macbook running snow leopard. lots of USB sticks about etc. can someone point me in the direction of some good guides?<br /><br />my initial plan was to set-up ubuntu on a secret true-crypt partition on a bootable USB stick. i couldn&#039;t get it work and it&#039;s slightly over my head tbh. i wanted to set up pgp on it, some kind of note system and password crypt? (all things i&#039;ve read about but don&#039;t really know where to start).<br /><br />which is the best route to go? could i wipe the whole of my old macbook drive and make that duel boot? wouldn&#039;t running a system off usb be slow and buggy?<br /><br />any help would be much appreciated!<br /><br />cheers very much.&nbsp; :)

				Running an OS off a USB will only be slow if it&#039;s not a live OS. Live OS&#039;s load their contents into RAM, which is both secure and pretty fast.<br /><br />TAILS and Liberte work well for this. TAILS is much easier to get going on a Mac, though as far as I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s not possible to use their new persistence mode, meaning you won&#039;t be able to save things to it, such as your GPG key. As a workaround, you could use a separate USB key with encryption to store all your important files. TAILS offers a built in encryption method, and you can also enable TrueCrypt on startup (see the documentation on the TAILS site).<br /><br />Download unetbootin on your mac and use it to make a bootable copy of TAILS. Download and install refit so that you can boot it. If you have trouble, installing refit to another USB key (yes, this would be a total of three usb keys for you now) sometimes works.<br /><br />If you want to go the route you were suggesting, try looking up a means to create a live copy of Ubuntu with persistence. This can be a tad difficult to get set up. If you just use the method of creating a bootable Ubuntu USB that&#039;s on their website, you&#039;ll wind up with no persistence and likely wear out your USB drive pretty quickly. It&#039;s my understanding that it&#039;s fairly difficult to encrypt the entirety of an OS, so you&#039;d have to have an ecrypted bundle within Ubuntu to store your sensitive files as well as the Liberte/TAILS VM files. The VM may also leave traces of your activities outside of the encrypted areas.<br /><br />Good luck.

				I have no clue when it comes to Mac OS....<br /><br />Maybe take a look at this. It is a simple method for full disk encryption. Relatively easy to set up. Should run as dual boot...afaik<br />http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2011/05/10/how-to-install-ubuntu-11-04-on-an-encrypted-lvm-file-system/<br />Works for ubuntu 12.04 as well<br />This way you got a complete OS that you can configure however you want. Tor, gpg... etc.Full encrypted.<br /><br />Maybe look also into something called Tor isolated VM...I only found that atm..as an example<br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX#DownloadpreconfiguredTorBOXimages<br />http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/aczeskis/random/tor-hidden-service-vm.html<br />Just google a bit and maybe set something up yourself..<br /><br />and maybe take a look at this...and stay away from liberte for now.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21858.0<br /><br /><br />
