				Hello everyone, sorry for what I know is a noob question, and hopefully this doesn&#039;t incite the boards collective ire, I&#039;m just new to all of this. If I&#039;m purchasing small amounts of bitcoins (like 10-20 at a time), and only really engaging SR for small person things, is it necessary to employ the elaborate procedures to ensure complete anonymity in terms of purchasing the bitcoins? <br /><br />Again, sorry if this is a basic question. I have been reading through the message board, and it seems people are doing elaborate methods of obtaining and transferring bitcoins, but for far larger amounts than I plan on engaging with.

				It&#039;s not illegal to buy bitcoins. The bigest security threat for buyers is between you and the mailbox.

As such if you use a bank account for instance to buy your initial Bitcoins and the Police were able to seize the records of your Bitcoin exchange provider, in theory they could link you to the purchase.<br /><br />Of course, it would still be necessary to link the coins you sent to a specific seller and prove you received a specific item from them so the risk is quite small. You can minimise that by running your coins through a mixing service, which swaps the Bitcoins you bought for other people&#039;s.<br /><br />My favourite mixer is Bitcoinfog. Feel free to repost if you need any more help.<br /><br />V.

				But this is still unclear to me (not OP), and I&#039;ve tried mightily to understand. Regarding linking coins to a seller, doesn&#039;t SR&#039;s internal tumbler solve this issue? And as for linking bitcoins throughout the chain, if I buy 2 bitcoins in my name from MtGox, for example, and Mt.Gox gives up my name to LE, are you saying that if I send those 2 bitcoins to my Bitcoin Wallet in my PC and then later use 1 bitcoin from my wallet to pay for something, my name is still attached in some way to that last bitcoin?

So if you were to receive two coins from one address and were to send each one to separate wallets, in theory they could still be traced provided you knew the owner of the original wallet.<br /><br />In practice splitting your funds across several wallets or sending random amounts of money to your own wallets using a new address each time is a good way to make it more difficult to track the passage of your coins throughout the network.<br /><br />The most secure method of anonymity is either to buy your coins for cash (a service which as I mentioned I hope to offer in the near future!) or run your coins through a mixing service like Bitcoinfog which for a commission of around 2-3% you can mix your coins with other people&#039;s, making them impossible to trace back to you by analysing the Bitcoin network.<br /><br />V.
