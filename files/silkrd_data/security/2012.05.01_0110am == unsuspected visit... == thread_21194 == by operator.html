				Don&#039;t want to go into detail, they asked me not to. Posting on somebody elses behalf to warn the community.<br /><br />New drop, ordered from 2 vendors one after another (approx a week apart.) with all packages arriving with no problems/flaws. Week or so later, theres an obvious visit from a stern knock early in the morning. Needless to say, it was ignored until shortly after the owner of the property unlocked the door for the authorities (no, not the resident) and they began to search inside. They find nothing, the resident did not say a word and just let it all happen. They left, and havent returned. <br /><br />No letters, no phonecalls, no warnings. Nothing had to be signed for, no customs tape, no lost shipments...what happened?<br /><br />Happened in USA.

				One of the rules of LEOs that I&#039;ve often heard touted with regards to drugs is that during a bust they can not let drugs re-enter the community. For example if you were selling drugs to a narc, he wouldn&#039;t comply in your instructions to hand the cannabis joint you just gave him to a random person on the street. He would be letting drugs back into the community. He could smoke them, but he couldn&#039;t give them away (he could be harming the community and not himself)<br />I&#039;m just trying to logically apply this idea to your drop. If the police knew those packages contained dope, why did they let them through?<br />Why didn&#039;t they crack the cherry right then?<br />It&#039;s possible they were playing the waiting game hoping more would arrive<br /><br />My best guess is that there is something going on at that residence that you do not know about.<br />Drug dealing, domestic violence, drug manufacturing.. or someone at the residence has a serious enemy who knew what was up with drugs being kept/ordered there<br /><br />Just as well, if this happened in the USA I believe they are legally required to disclose the warrant (leave a copy or notify the party that a warrant was issued). Can you tell us at least what state this happened in?<br />A search warrant had to be ordered (unless these were rogue mercs dressed as cops).. and that search warrant had to be ORDERED BY A JUDGE FOR A REASON. <br />You can request to know this reason, it will be written on the warrant. To my knowledge it must be disclosed unless it&#039;s one of those super totalitarian post 9/11 era secret warrants where they can come in without you knowing, gather evidence and leave<br /><br />Let us know what you find, this is incredibly interesting if it is a real non-fear mongering post<br /><br />

				If you are 100% certain that no residents are vending product then this is interesting. It certainly doesn&#039;t bear the hallmarks of a controlled delivery. Above personal use quantities? And what schedule are we talking about?<br /><br />Some possibilities:<br /><br />-&gt; LE personnel screwed up the CD timing.<br />-&gt; Random chance.<br />-&gt; LE has a new trick.<br />-&gt; Vendors got busted, had stored your information and passed it on.<br /><br />Some questions:<br /><br />-&gt; Did they show a search warrant?<br />-&gt; Are the original vendors still in business?<br />-&gt; No dogs?<br />-&gt; Compare and contrast: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LE with local accents, LE with out of state accents?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What did their clothes look like? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did they say anything to each other? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it is remembered, then quote precisely what they said. esp. terminology, slang to each other.<br /><br />If I were to hazard a guess with the information you&#039;ve given, resident ordered above personal use quantities, a vendor got busted who foolishly had kept resident&#039;s address, which generated a follow up knock and talk event later. Otherwise the resident was snitched on by an informant if he distributed the drugs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is person you are posting on behalf of involved in physical drug activity as well?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. They do not deal, manufacture, etc. They are a personal drug user, and thats it. There was also NOTHING illicit in the residence whatsoever.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just as well, if this happened in the USA I believe they are legally required to disclose the warrant (leave a copy or notify the party that a warrant was issued). Can you tell us at least what state this happened in?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the advice in your post and insight. No, they left no notice/copy of the warrant. The drop was home alone when this happened. They were let in by the owner of the complex, that&#039;s as much detail as I believe they want me to go in. It is in a known drug state, i&#039;ll say that much. Think Texas, Illinois, Michigan, New York...one of those. Don&#039;t know if that constitutes for much. But it was NOT in a dangerous neighborhood, bad part of town, big metro city, it was a nice suburban area with little/no crime. Drop also has no convictions or anything besides some driving history.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And you didnt even ask to see the warrent?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It was the drop, not me. And again, they were let in by the owner of the property, not anybody who resided in the residence..<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-&gt; Did they show a search warrant?<br />-&gt; Are the original vendors still in business?<br />-&gt; No dogs?<br />-&gt; Compare and contrast:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LE with local accents, LE with out of state accents?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What did their clothes look like?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did they say anything to each other?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it is remembered, then quote precisely what they said. esp. terminology, slang to each other.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. Drop was shown nothing, they did not even answer the door as it was inconvenient timing when they knocked. Shortly after, they were just let inside by the owner of the property. In fact, they never really had contact with the drop due to the time of day they came.<br /><br />They were able to identify them as two men, of older/stern sounding people but that&#039;s all. They didn&#039;t physically see them, as fucked up as that sounds. It&#039;s because of the time of day they came, if you catch my drift. I won&#039;t go into any more detail than that, because they have not heard from them to date and don&#039;t want to fuck that up.<br /><br />They had a conversation to the property owner, is what they heard. Mentioned that they were vague to the property owner, saying there were packages that &quot;weren&#039;t supposed to arrive here&quot; and they needed to retreive them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They don&#039;t need warrants when you live in an apartment.&nbsp; Usually the landlord gives consent, they&#039;re the true property owner.&nbsp; You usually sign something stating they can come in at any time when you sign the lease. Also forgot to ask, was it from Tony76?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That might explain a lot, thank you. People should take note of this! And no, it was not from Tony76. It was from an extremely reputable vendor on here from NL. The most consistent one to date i&#039;ve seen.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or, fwiw, could have been parole or probation officer checking on somebody, who knows...easy to read to much into stuff.&nbsp; Paranoia can be infectious </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...no. not this time, unfortunately.<br /><br />Thanks everybody for their advice and insight, i&#039;ve warned the vendor already and hope we can just learn from this. This isn&#039;t some kind of scare tactic, i&#039;m not trying to sit here and advocate nobody use the site, in fact I almost feel this cemented some beliefs on here to be true after all, when it comes to an interaction with the law. <br />

				NL vendors have to use a middle country to redrop the mail like DutchGreenClub uses.

No letter, no questions, nothing they just left and never came back.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mind mentioning the quantity we&#039;re talking about here?&nbsp; Perhaps in very general terms, S, M, L, XL?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>5 grams but I won&#039;t say the vendor obviously, just that they are located in the Netherlands.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s interesting that a lot of people are posting lately that the cops came, made contact and left.&nbsp; Could be coincidence or perhaps part of a larger effort to gather information.&nbsp; The Federal Government could spend months or even years collecting information about a place like SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn&#039;t assume they just left, but it&#039;s hard to imagine their staking you out over 5 grams!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This happened months ago and was actually one of the first purchases I made so it took me a while to order something again but I never used that address again. I just think they wanted to figure out who was sending the MDMA and from what I can tell if the package is coming from the NL it will most likely be flagged and go through a more thorough search (x-rays, dogs, etc) and if they see a powder substance then they get the greenlight to open the package and find the illegal substance.

For example if you were selling drugs to a narc, he wouldn&#039;t comply in your instructions to hand the cannabis joint you just gave him to a random person on the street. He would be letting drugs back into the community. He could smoke them, but he couldn&#039;t give them away (he could be harming the community and not himself)<br />I&#039;m just trying to logically apply this idea to your drop. If the police knew those packages contained dope, why did they let them through?<br />Why didn&#039;t they crack the cherry right then?<br />It&#039;s possible they were playing the waiting game hoping more would arrive<br /><br />My best guess is that there is something going on at that residence that you do not know about.<br />Drug dealing, domestic violence, drug manufacturing.. or someone at the residence has a serious enemy who knew what was up with drugs being kept/ordered there<br /><br />Just as well, if this happened in the USA I believe they are legally required to disclose the warrant (leave a copy or notify the party that a warrant was issued). Can you tell us at least what state this happened in?<br />A search warrant had to be ordered (unless these were rogue mercs dressed as cops).. and that search warrant had to be ORDERED BY A JUDGE FOR A REASON. <br />You can request to know this reason, it will be written on the warrant. To my knowledge it must be disclosed unless it&#039;s one of those super totalitarian post 9/11 era secret warrants where they can come in without you knowing, gather evidence and leave<br /><br />Let us know what you find, this is incredibly interesting if it is a real non-fear mongering post<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry but that is 100% false. Cops working undercover/narcs are protected by law and can break any drug related law without fear of prosecution. There is a bill that protects them.<br /><br />Do you honestly believe that they wouldn&#039;t let drugs, let alone a cannabis joint re-enter the community? Out of all the shady things police do, which cannot be denied. Police are people who are around these kinds of activities every single day, they are humans, adults. They are not angels. <br /><br />They are supposed to put on a good image for the media, and they will say one thing and do another.<br /><br />It&#039;s like many people, who have employers who smoke weed and do other shit, cuss on the job, steal, but to the media/public they have a very good apperance.<br /><br />If you&#039;re the media who are you going to believe? The drug dealer who just got busted buying 5lbs of coke or the officer?<br /><br /><br />Cops would rather catch you WITH drugs, than catch a package coming to you. Their power is limited if they catch the package. If they know you receive the package and then go on to say that &quot;somebody alerted us of this persons activity and this persons information must be kept private&quot;, then they get a warrant. It would be exceedingly easy to lie and get a warrant. The political system is so fucked these days.
