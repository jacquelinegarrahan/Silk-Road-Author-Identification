TorMail provides a great service for the community.<br /><br />However, you can create email accounts over Tor on some clearnet webmail providers. I know that Yahoo Mail, Safe Mail, and Yandex work over Tor. Safe Mail is the best option, because it uses SSL by default and has a simple interface which you can use with JavaScript disabled. You&#039;ll want to turn off IP checking, otherwise it will log you out when you switch exit nodes after 10 minutes.

				You DO NOT want to use any service over Tor that has ever been associated with your &quot;real&quot; identity or IP address.&nbsp; Google/Gmail and plenty of other email accounts can be created over Tor easily, they simply require a phone number to verify the account.&nbsp; DO NOT use any number associated with you–use a burner phone or get access to the phone of a person you do not know.&nbsp; Then, access that email via, and only via, Tor.
