				Everytime I try to place a order with Bitinstant it does not even give me the Zipzap or any info for the Moneygram.<br />It just says, &quot;We are experiencing problems with one of our partners&quot; please try again later.<br />I don&#039;t understand what that even means, I tried to open on different browsers and same problem.<br />I would use another alternative but the cops took my ID so I am waiting on a new one in the mail so I can&#039;t use Western Unions or anything else to get BTC until then.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m getting the same thing here. They changed their interface too, it&#039;s strange now. I&#039;m not aware of too many alternatives, so I&#039;m staying posted on this thread so I can see what&#039;s up.<br /><br />By the way, there is a thread about this already in a different section.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174679.0

				Yeah, this is super frustrated. I created an account and I got past the message but I accidentally placed an order for BTC -&gt; BTC, which is no good. I tried making another order and then it said that I exceeded my daily limit. Even creating a new account leads me to the message that I&#039;m exceeding my daily limit (no matter how much I try and buy). This is fucking frustrating. I looking into localbitcoin but didn&#039;t like the feel of that one. Also wasn&#039;t too sure about the E-mail service that was mentioned in the other thread that I can&#039;t think of the name of.

				They are indeed having some problems. After paying my order, I received a confirmation email from them but did not receive my coins. I had to contact them through their support email to get my coins. Took pretty much a whole extra day to get it sorted. Doesn&#039;t sound very &quot;instant&quot; to me.&nbsp; :-\

				BitInstant&#039;s been all screwed up for the last week or so. They&#039;re going to lose a ton of customers over this.

				I haven&#039;t used bitinstant in awhile and while I was considering them a few weeks back I put the brakes on that because of all the troubles they&#039;ve been having.&nbsp; I&#039;m still waiting for positive feedback as the consensus before I use bitinstant again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used localbitcoins personally, but I might try it at some point.&nbsp; I see there is only 1 person in my city that even does it and they have no feedback so who knows.&nbsp; The last time I actually bought bitcoin I just used one of the SR vendors who can sell you bitcoin in exchange for moneypak.&nbsp; I used moneyhoney with her intro rate of 5% and it worked great.&nbsp; She can be trusted, but now her rates are higher.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind too much though because if I&#039;m going to use localbitcoins and drive my gas guzzler to the appointment and waste all that time I might as well go to CVS and pickup a moneypak card and do it the easy way with a SR vendor.&nbsp;

				hey guys, I have been vested in bts for a while and have some that I&#039;m willing to sell. Easy, fast, reliable, and have the btcs available. No gimmicks, foreal. Actually, if you hit me up via pgp and give a referral, I&#039;d be happy to give anyone a discounted rate.

				I didnt like how bitinstant was asking me to verify questions of who lived with me when and where making me choose the right answer, they without a doubt have some sort of database from which they draw the information of occupants of your home, ect
