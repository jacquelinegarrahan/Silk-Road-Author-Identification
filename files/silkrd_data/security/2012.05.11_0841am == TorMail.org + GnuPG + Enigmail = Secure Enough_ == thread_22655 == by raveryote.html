				This may be paranoia, but do yall think this is sufficiently paranoid?<br /><br />I do not know who runs Tormail.org, could even be the feds, for all I know.<br /><br />BUT, if i encrypt everything important with OpenPGP mail encryption, should be okay, right?

				Tormail + PGP/GPG definitely takes you out of the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; category I&#039;d say.<br /><br />Originally I only got Tormail for drug stuff. Then as I did more investigation it became apparent I had been treating Google like a friendly government agency. I am presently shifting all my gmail related stuff (except for contact with government entities and such) from gmail over to tormail.<br />
