				Recently, I was contacted by someone with my bank, and they wanted to know why I have been making frequent, regular cash deposits over the past 18 months (since I have been funding my btc accounts via bank transfers), how they were inconsistent with the previous decade of my banking practices at that bank,etc. I explained to them how this money was simply recycled investment money, investing a large amount to make a small amount of profit, as side income, a hobby, more or le&#039;ss. I basically asked her if she wanted my stock portfolio and my mothers birth certificate and my bathroom schedule. She politely explained it was just some backroom stuff&#039;, they need to make sure everyone is on the up and up, and theyd contact me if they had any more questions.<br /><br />So I&#039;m just curious, should I abandon my current funding method? I hate walking in with a wad of 20s and 100s every week, but its always been consistent with the type of legitimate business I am involved in. (self employment) Has anyone else been hassled since funding a SR account? What type of things are the banks looking for and are they reporting to big brother? All my transfers have been small, under 5k. Should I switch banks? They never called when I lost my job to ask why I stopped making money, why they calling when they think I might be making a dollar they dont know about? This society is doomed.

				Shit like this is why we need Bitcoin and Zerocoin. Banks are supposed to hold your money. Their business is to make money by loaning your money to other people (fractional reserve banking). Unfortunately, banking laws have turned them into police organizations. Every purchase is watched and stored forever. Inconsistent with your last decade of banking? Jesus. They know about that sandwich you bought in 1993.<br />

				From the US I assume? <br /><br />In Canada using Cavirtex exchange you can drop cash in to their bank account without using any names. Easy anon way to fund your SR account. <br /><br /><br />

				An old friend used to work in a bank and she said €200 weekly deposits are flagged as suspicious.<br /><br />I would open an account with a new bank or change your funding method. They basically rang you and made it explicit that they suspect you of something. Take it as a warning and get out.

I really couldn&#039;t comment on whether changing banks would be a good idea. Maybe you should look for another way to get your Bitcoins. Like cash in post or something. If you found someone with a lot of Bitcoins to sell, you could set up a relationship.
