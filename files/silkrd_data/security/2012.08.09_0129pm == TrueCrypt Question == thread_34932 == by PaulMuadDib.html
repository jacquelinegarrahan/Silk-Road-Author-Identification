				Where should I store my true-crypt key file?&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it a security risk to have this easily accessible outside my encrypted flashed drive??

				If you use a sufficiently strong password, it shouldn&#039;t matter if your TrueCrypt file is found in the sense that they still won&#039;t be able to decrypt the data.<br /><br />However, you may still want to keep it in a hidden location, such as in a folder with files with similar sizes and names or on an easily destroyed flash drive. The use of encryption itself can raise suspicions against you, and in fact if you live in the UK you should be aware of a bizarre law that requires people to disclose their private keys and passwords (noncooperation carries a maximum prison sentence of 2 years).<br /><br />Edit: In addition to the above, you could consider a hidden volume inside your TrueCrypt file for plausible deniability.

				Yeah I got the partition filled with plausible degraded PORN that would need hiding from my girlfriend........&#039;Sorry officer sometimes I feel like a lady with a cock!&#039;&nbsp; lol<br /><br />But I was worried specifically about the key file that I use in combination with a strong password to open my hidden drive.

As such I&#039;d suggest you use an innocuous compressed file such as an MP3 - download a few hundred to your hard drive and select one or more at random to be your Keyfile. <br /><br />May the hand of God guide us..<br /><br />V.

				Also, if you can, keep the entire drive containing the hidden partition in storage when not immediately in use. LE can tell that your fake OS was never used, and if it&#039;s on a drive sitting in a computer that they know has been on recently, it&#039;s pretty obvious that you are using a hidden OS and not the fake one containing dickgirl porn. All they have to do is check the file access dates. Since you can&#039;t boot up the fake OS without risking corruption of the hidden partition, there&#039;s no way you can easily make it look &quot;used&quot;. By storing it outside of the computer, you now have the option of claiming the drive contains some old backups that you forgot about.
