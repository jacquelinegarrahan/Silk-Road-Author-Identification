				Nothing to worry about here, just speculation...<br /><br />Is it possible for Law enforcement to set up fake seller accounts in an attempt to catch big time buyers? Back in sept/oct when I first found out about Silk road, I was looking around at all the different vendors and what they had to sell, when I found someone trying to sell a very large amount of heroin. I might be mistaken, but the U.S dollar value of what he was trying to sell was about 50,000 dollars. Thats a LOT of heroin. I&#039;m not a heroin user, and have no interest in buying any, but the sheer amount and price made me wonder if it was a real seller, or just LE trying to catch a big time H dealer. I don&#039;t believe this listing is up anymore, and the vendor account that was selling it ( The Boss) no longer has any active listings. If I was LE, I would probably name my fake seller account something like &quot;the boss&quot; to sound like a big, mean, scary drug dealer to the rest of SR.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on this? I may be wrong on the price, but it was definately somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars. I would not risk a 50k order being shipped in the mail either. Even if it couldn&#039;t be traced back to you, I feel that LE would definately come knocking on the door of the address that such a large order was being sent to no matter what if it was confiscated by customs.

				I would avoid buying bulk of most drugs on SR, possibly weed being an exception. Also possibly exceptions for people who are highly vouched for. Anyone can be a vendor here. Dealers buy from bulk vendors. If the police want to bust dealers, it makes sense that they would set up as bulk vendors. I think it is not unreasonable to assume that they may even set up as vendors to bust smaller time buyers, although perhaps there is less concern for this. It doesn&#039;t look like they are doing this so far anyway, considering the low number of busts we are aware of regarding buyers, which is pretty much in line with what we would expect from interceptions. Of course if the police intercept $50,000 worth of heroin they are going to raid the address it was shipped to, that much is obvious. That said there have been successful and legitimate bulk online dealers, and people have even shipped millions of dollars worth of drugs through the mail (although not online vendors afaik, although there have been plenty of hundred thousand dollar + shipments). There are private forums for bulk deals, where vendors get in contact with big suppliers. These forums are invitation only and you cannot vend on them unless you have been vouched for by a lot of people who have multi-year reputations and have just as many people willing to vouch for them. That is the environment for bulk dealing imo, SR is perfect for dealing to end consumers and small time dealers though.

				If a vendor sold to you and it turned out to be the feds that would be entrapment. Surely a vendor how has been vending for a while now with a lot of feedback cannot be LE, there&#039;s too much evidence<br />against the feds. Imagine how that would look in court for LE.

				I dont see the problem here, anyone who buys bulk from a vendor who hasnt been on here a while and built up alot or rep is asking for it. The cops might be able to slither by selling small quantities to build a little cred but the judge aint going to look to kindly on them for selling 100keys of coke just to build up enough cred to lure bulk buyers. Contrary to popular belief there IS a limit on how much illegal shit cops can get away with before they themselves become the target of the law. <br /><br />Cop:Your honor, we successfully collected evidence showing the defendant ordering large quantities of coke from us.<br />&nbsp;Judge: I see, and how did you go about doing that<br />Cop: Well, we setup a vendor account on the silk road and sold more coke than anyone else!<br />&nbsp;<br />right.

				Almost the same as a question a few days ago , except when I wrote this , I was just not called a full fool. Only just;;<br /><br />Are bitcoins illegal?<br /><br />L.E. as a honeypot...LOL !!!<br /><br />Is there a different law for L.E. so they can possess illegal drugs?<br /><br />Just an other stupid question!<br /><br />To sell drugs is a real big crime!<br /><br />To buy a little is not.<br /><br />L.E. can not commit a big crime just to catch you for a little crime.<br /><br />And when the have confiscated drugs they have to destroy those drugs once it has done it use as evidence.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s the law where i live. The police can not even follow a shipment to find out who the big guys are.<br /><br />Cause they have lost track of such shipments in the past.<br /><br />So no if the police can prevent to let the drugs enter the market, they have to act, before those drugs do enter the market again.<br /><br />But maybe the police is the biggest supplier of narcotics in the states, it wouldn&#039;t surprise me&nbsp; at all !<br /><br />They sell even weapons to Iranians who keep Americans hostage etc !

				In some countries in Europe the police are not allowed to do reverse stings. In the USA they are allowed to and they are fairly common at that. <br /><br />DEA agents have full exception from controlled substance act. They are allowed to purchase, use and sell all controlled substances, in an undercover capacity.

				I just can&#039;t see it being worth the risk for someone to spend over 50k on seller with almost no reputation. If your that much into the heroin game that your trying to buy pounds and kilos, then you probably have your own real life connects that can get that shit for you

I would guess a bit of everything. I think kmfkewm is more on track about how bulk transactions take place. I love SR, but c&#039;mon. You really gonna jump on here and do a six figure deal cause the feedback says it&#039;s good? If you do then you deserve what you get. I don&#039;t think LE could sell enough dope to gain that rep without getting exposed.&nbsp; Vendors like this are sketchy as fuck.

				Im no expert, But i can agree with the Former LEO Officer, it certainly is not entrapment. But however if they were allowed to set up a seller account say, And sell minor quantities under say X amount , They could just act like a new seller, most new sellers start with small quantities anyway as nobody will buy bulk from somebody with no rep usually. <br /><br />But it must be true that they cant let the drugs get back into circulation, If they sell an ounce of H or cocaine then it&#039;s gunna get broken down and sold on. So they would have to make an arrest in some way or get the drugs back anyway. So we might start to notice a pattern of , Ohh look, everyone who has bought over an ounce from this guy stopped logging on or just dissapeared. If they did it quick enough then said person would not have time to log into the forums and let people know So we wouldn&#039;t know about the bust. <br /><br />It really is bait, SR is different for small time and big time. If your buying bulk, You need different techniques and methods to somebody buying for personal use. It&#039;s like a business you need to take extra precautions and really take a month or two to learn everything properly. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s not illegal for police to make multiple small buys in order to do an investigation. It is common these days for investigations to take YEARS to take down motorcycle gangs, and big groups. OK then, we agree that a lot of buyers out there could actually be LE? Ok, next if they set up a vendor that only sold to his (in reality) own people, that would get them the statistics that could enable larger buys. They set up larger buys and larger sells. More statistics, and they aren&#039;t letting product onto the streets. You actually have vendors doing the same thing when they are trying to &#039;up&#039; their stastistics, but they don&#039;t want to waste too much money doing that. The government doesn&#039;t have those financial &#039;scruples&#039;.<br />So if your a vendor, you&#039;ll be getting addresses, and depending on how large the purchases are makes&nbsp; you more or less &#039;eligible&#039; for a raid.&nbsp; Once they get a address and a decent size package (maybe more than a ounce?) They can raid your place, and if you are competent regarding security, ie. Tails, a non persistent OS, or a encrypted disk that hides your activities, that BREAKS the chain. You have plausible deniability. If not, and they &#039;turn you&#039; (10+ years in federal prison turns most small time people) that is another cog that is now part of the SR. <br />It&#039;s possible, but it would take a lot of money (government has that) and it would take a lot of time (government has that too). If there was enough pressure (through publicity, constant news stories which the government can influence) Senator&#039;s (like that creep Schumer in NY). <br />If, like the above poster noted, that there is another darknet group that deals in large amounts, obviously that would be more enticing than small guys. The Feds aren&#039;t going to go after small people, I think most people are pretty safe. <br />But the weak point (like so many SR posters have noted) is your computer-if you &#039;did it&#039; on Windows, there is a perfect record of the crime. <br />Something else that&#039;s been mentioned numerous times here-they may not want to give SR the publicity (I think it&#039;s called the Streisand effect, when Barbara Streisand started suing a photographer for publishing photos of here beachfront house, all of a sudden everybody was taking pictures)<br />And if enough time goes by (SR has been operating for about 3 years give or take?) you change society. A real network could do that. <br /><br />Interesting times! This may be a folk tale, but I thought that the VHS vs. Betamax video &#039;war&#039; was decided by the mass of people renting VHS tapes, so that kind of introduces the effect of demography (mass of people)<br /><br />People who say that absolutely the DEA can&#039;t let ANY dope on the streets, are in my opinion naive. They did worse with &#039;Fast and Furious&#039; gun &#039;sting&#039;. I agree that they would get a lot of bad publicity if they were letting &#039;keys&#039; out on the street, but they constantly use informants who use drugs-they just don&#039;t &#039;see&#039; those people and use them for information. There&#039;s a lot of stuff that the legal system overlooks intentionally and the cops can just lie about the rest.

				There&#039;s also the chance that a high profile, trusted vendor gets busted and cooperates fully with the law to take other people down, handing over his account and GPG keys.<br /><br />That would be my main worry if I were ordering huge amounts from SR, it&#039;s not like we know them personally and they&#039;d get slashed up in the big house for being a grass; dealers here are anonymous.

				From what I&#039;ve heard if the feds physically seize the contraband, whatever that might be, they cannot let it go. On the other hand if they know about a big sale happening they can set up surveillance on the peeps involved and try and catch the intended target or just try and keep gaining info and not arrest them at that time, like what happened in fast in the furious. But the feds can&#039;t physically send drugs/guns etc. out to customers and not arrest them on the spot.

				They didn&#039;t set up surveillance for the guns. They were supposed to go to the cartels. It was a political thing, not a law enforcement thing. That&#039;s why it eventually leaked out, and individual ATF agents helped congress with the (curtailed) investigation. Then obama claimed executive privilege and basically halted the investigation. Before you think I&#039;m a republican, I despise both parties equally well. <br />Regarding &#039;embarrassment&#039;, I don&#039;t know how much more &#039;embarrassing&#039; having a gun that was supposed to be &#039;bait&#039; get away (best knowledge is 2000+ guns)and kill another federal cop. 2 guns were directly linked to &#039;Fast and Furious&#039; and that Custums guy or ICE guy that was killed. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t mean you were naive sleepyeyes2k2, I know you know more about investigations than I do. But I DO know that C.I.&#039;s are allowed (informally) to continue to use and in fact are often GIVEN drugs at a city cop level. It&#039;s common knowledge on the street. That&#039;s what makes the narc&#039;s so dangerous. I also know that there are declared C.I&#039;s and &#039;undeclared&#039; CI&#039;s. Cops have to be more careful of the declared ones, cause there is paperwork that links the cops and the C.I&#039;s, the other C.I&#039;s have &#039;plausible deniability&#039;. I&#039;ve been arrested with another junkie (years and years ago) and the cop let the other guy go (kept his dope though) and took me in. I watched it and the cop didn&#039;t care what I saw, it&#039;s not like anybody would listen to me. And what they tell a judge, compared to what they can and do do on the street, can be pretty huge. <br /><br />I agree 100% that a goal of LE is to get us to worry about each other and not &#039;trust&#039; (insomuch that there is trust) anybody on SR. But short of paranoia, it doesn&#039;t hurt to think of possibilities for compromise.

				Another example of a federal &#039;sting&#039; gone wrong. One of the &#039;highlights&#039; was that they lost a MP-5 machinegun that was locked in a automobile, with a couple of pistols. One of the pistols was eventually pawned to the pawnshop set up as a &#039;sting&#039;. They left owing the landlord unpaid rent, broken doors, plumbing damage etc. and when he complained he was threatened with &#039;harassing&#039; LE if he continued to ask for his rent. <br /><br />Pretty interesting (and illuminating) article-probably not illustrative of a typical investigation, however it shows that the cops aren&#039;t too worried about societal &#039;norms&#039; and in fact only have to obey the law in a superficial manner. <br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />A Journal Sentinel investigation revealed problems in a 10-month ATF sting in Milwaukee - agents&#039; guns, including a machine gun, being stolen; the loss of an ATF ballistic shield; the theft of nearly $40,000 in merchandise from the sting storefront; careless handling of a sensitive operational plan; and the charging of the wrong suspects.<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br /><br />Clearnet warning!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/lawmakers-ask-inspector-general-to-investigate-atfs-flawed-milwaukee-sting-jk8q0qj-191463651.html<br /><br />clearnet warning!!

				To his credit Sleepyeyes, the Aussie guy that was caught was an absolute imbecile, driving around with his vendor name on his vehicle licence plates, bignoting himself and his business to his friends over mobile phones, then giving up his account information as he rolls over to reduce his sentence.

				If they have any kind of plan, it&#039;s almost certainly not revolved around posing as a vendor. What will they gain? The name and address of a few people who like so smoke a little weed or do a little blow on the weekend? Big fuckin deal! They might have (and I&#039;m sure they have) opened vendor accounts just to gain insight and poke around on how the system all works.. but actively vending.. will net them nothing. It would be a waste of time, money, resources, and obviously introducing drugs into circulation is not their job. If anything, they probably have wet dreams of breaking the technology and tracking down the main server.. which as I understand would be impossible unless maybe the NSA was dedicating resources. And the NSA certainly doesn&#039;t give a fuck nor is it in their objectives.<br />That leaves opening buyer accounts (which I think we all agree they do) and buying from vendors. Again, so what. They wouldn&#039;t be able to track a vendor. But maybe buy bulk and somehow get close to a vendor.. throw all their resources and bust 1 vendor maybe? Again, would it be worth it? Or option C) social engineer there way into DPR&#039;s inner circle.. which.. you guessed.. he is surely not making friends here and probably purposely disguises his typing style and other such red herrings if he&#039;s smart (which he definetly fucking is). I personally feel that though they&#039;re definetly keeping an eye and casually making purchases here just to go through the motions.. their attitude towards this entire thing is &quot;let sleeping dogs lie&quot;. There is no violence, no street crime, no middle school kids buying crack and dying.. so why bother?

I believe just the order is intent to commit a felony with some conspiracy charges as well. This worries me even more when you get the order from a vendor that is just a 100 mile radius, or least that&#039;s the mail stamp. It all becomes so stressful when you think of all the possibilities there are for LE to ruin your life. I can&#039;t help thinking with the rise of coin to this incredible high it has got to be drawing far more attention because they hate for others to profit more than they deem small time. Also, with the increase of value in the coin it appears there has been a HUGE increase in new buyers and sellers. Many are jumping in with out doing their home work. For instance I had a vendor send priority box without enough postage. Getting a notice that you need to&nbsp; come to the PO and [pay the difference to pick up the package. Even if you do not get the package it puts that address on the radar.<br /><br />But the vendor on vaction scares me the most..&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(&nbsp; &nbsp;:-X

				Ok, I owe you an apology I think because I confused your point.&nbsp; I agree that it&#039;s not really worth their time or resources, however, I think it is entirely reasonable that they have in fact set up at least a few vendor accounts, if for nothing more than to examine the system and see how it works.&nbsp; I would have to assume that whatever identifying information they got from that experiment would be saved somewhere.&nbsp; Maybe the feds are the &quot;scammers&quot; that never ship.&nbsp; I wonder if anyone has considered that?&nbsp; That would be like a double bonus on their part, they got (albeit pennies to them) some SR user&#039;s money AND info on how it works.&nbsp; Now that I think is reasonable.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think every vendor is a fed, but I do think they know far more than we realize.&nbsp; While you may have interacted with them for years and you may have even been high up, there are untold levels of spying and criminality throughout the government, more and more so as you go up.&nbsp; I do think your experience and insight is very useful and I should appreciate that more.&nbsp; That said I&#039;m thinking you know as well as I do that whatever you may have learned is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to crimes by government against its citizens.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to preach paranoia as living in fear constantly; rather just assume that &quot;they&quot; are always watching your every move and that they know everything you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; When I approach the problem that way, the solution is simple and obvious: plan around how to deny them the information they need in court to make any charges stick.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna go back and upvote you just because.&nbsp; (I didn&#039;t downvote, but my comments I&#039;m sure contributed.)&nbsp; Peace!<br />

				I appreciate your concession and your conciliatory tone, and I happily return it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you&#039;re paranoid to assume that the government is actively seeking information on every single poster in these forums, for example.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s paranoid to suspect that a vendor *might* be a fed, even.&nbsp; I agree that even my experience on the dark side is insufficient to completely inform my perspective on the DEA&#039;s current investigatory stratagems.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe that if the DEA has an agent or agents posing as vendors, it is for the purpose of getting close to other vendors, and to SR leadership.&nbsp; It is not, primarily, for the purpose of selling dope.&nbsp; So, I would expect most of his &quot;customers&quot; to be feds, as well.&nbsp; The occasional genuine order would be cancelled or, if domestic, possibly filled.&nbsp; The address would be recorded, and when the op was shut down, that address would be passed down to local LE.&nbsp; That&#039;s my theory, and I&#039;m sticking to it.<br /><br />+1 to you, EarlyCuyler, for being a stand-up guy.&nbsp; :)

				If it isn&#039;t paranoid for us to think that LE have purchased vendor accounts, then it also shouldn&#039;t be paranoid for us to think that it would also be possible for LE to have more than one account to bump up their feedback (cops leaving fake feedback for cops) in order to gain access to the vendors forum.

				We may be winning the war long term, but there are going to be many more casualties. <br />As far as cops selling to people and then busting them, it&#039;s a long used tactic. I&#039;ve heard of them doing it in Florida (newspaper) and I&#039;ve seen it on &#039;Cops&#039;. This guy in a pickup was buying crack pulled up to a street corner sitting in his truck. He&#039;d make the deal, and suddenly the cardboard box (marked as a refrigerator or range or something) in the pickup bed would &#039;explode&#039; and out would pop a couple of cops. <br />And does anybody remember John DeLorean (made the car in &#039;Back to the Future&#039;) his company was running out of money, the Feds found out he was looking for investment money and had a trafficker (turned FBI informant) get in touch with him. He bullied DeLorean into cooperating with him, and made threats against his daughter. He delayed giving the guy money, told the guy that the IRA (Irish Republican Army) had his money, told his attorney and left him a letter to open if he didn&#039;t return. Eventually he was acquitted, but it cost millions, and years of court proceedings. THAT was entrapment, not giving drugs to people who ask to purchase it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeLorean<br />The &#039;main&#039; thing that we have going for us is that we are too &#039;small time&#039; to attract much attention from the Feds (unless they see a point in coercing us for &#039;bigger fish&#039;)<br />Also they would relish the distrust and paranoia that worrying about going to jail for 40 years engenders. <br />But just like when you are speeding (in a car, I mean) with a bunch of other cars on the freeway, there&#039;s some safety in &#039;obscurity&#039;-being part of a big crowd. <br />We ARE changing the system. And I&#039;m encouraged that other places like &#039;Atlantis&#039; and &#039;Black Market Reloaded&#039; are also out there. We live and learn, and &#039;those who don&#039;t die, get stronger&#039;.

				I will throw in here just a personal opinion. <br /><br />All great thinking. Every post and it&#039;s all very plausible to get to a big payday for the powers that be. That&#039;s really the root. If your can think it know that it&#039;s already been thunk. All angels are covers and if u think any less then u are playing with your supposed freedom. <br /><br />They will stop at nothing to get what they want get what they need and take from that thing... Power. Power and money or money is power. This while forum is searchable via google u bet your assthey are watching every post. I guess the key is not to get to brazen not to get too rich cause once that happens people start to take notice and if they notice u well. U can be a target.<br /><br />So thank of the craziest thought and day nooooo... Then on the back end protect yourself for just that event. <br /><br />And know if u can&#039;t do the time don&#039;t do the crime. I now sappy but tru.
