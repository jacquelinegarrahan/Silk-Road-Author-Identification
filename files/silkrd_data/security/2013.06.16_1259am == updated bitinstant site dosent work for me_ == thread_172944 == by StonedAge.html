				All kinds of issues for me.&nbsp; I was able to process one transaction yesterday, after that, I tried another one and after entering in my state and zip, the country defaults to Russia and I can&#039;t edit it. It never creates a payment slip. So I attempted to re-do it. The same issue keep re-curing and now I&#039;m over the daily limit.&nbsp; So, I wait a few days later, and I go through the process&nbsp; I always do bitcoin to email, and today I&nbsp; get an email stating my payment was received and made but not processed to my email and that support is aware of it and no need to fill out another ticket, they are looking into it.&nbsp; That was over 8 hrs ago, and no resolution.&nbsp; They have my money and no I have no bitcoins. That really sucks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I made a verified account and it kept saying &quot;Can&#039;t verify identity, try again later&quot;.&nbsp; Sure enough, I waited about an hour, tried again and it worked just fine.&nbsp; It was frightening though, as dirtybiscuitzz718 said, how much they knew about my personal info...hope it isn&#039;t a bad decision.<br /><br />Anyway, you could probably try verifying your own info again to see if it works.

				Hey all, I created the transaction for BTC to PayPal, sent their wallet address the exact amount of BTC they requested. The confirmation page claimed about an hour for the funds to hit my paypal, now over 24 hours later I haven&#039;t received a dime... Emailed them this morning, still no response or funds. Used as a guest, right after the &quot;experiencing problems with partner site&quot; error stopped appearing. Not sure what I can do at this point but wait?

				Got guest to go through after many tries last night and did a $500 exchange and the coin in my email in under an hour, although they I was supposed to get $480 and coinapault said the coin I got was worth about $468, whatever, at least I got it. Today I went back for another transaction and spent all day trying to get through or make an account to no avail, but finally I tried to use my real info for the account and it worked first try, walmarts money center is closed, but Ill update after I get my coin tomorrow.
