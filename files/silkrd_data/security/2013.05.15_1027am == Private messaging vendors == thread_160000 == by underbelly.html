				I don&#039;t think you guys actually answered the question there.<br /><br /><br />I do not know if PMs are encrypted like addresses are on SR, if that is what you are asking?<br /><br />(I also heard that putting a plain text address into SR is safer than using privnote...)

				Nothing you send on SR is inherently encrypted by the system as far as I know.<br /><br />If you want text encrypted you have to do it yourself... I typically only encrypt very sensitive information.<br /><br />More importantly though it&#039;s best to just ensure your Tor Browser is encrypted with truecrypt so you can&#039;t be connected to SR any way, in the unlikely chance they do confiscate and search your shit... which itself is unlikely unless you&#039;re trafficking huge amounts of drugs.

				Ye that is how it is meant to be. Messages sent between buyer and vendor should only be viewable to those two people, coz its addressed to them, goes to their private page so only they should be able to see it. Maybe SR has some access maybe not Ive no idea but they are safe. For anyone else to be able to see this communication they will have to hack into it in some way, your account, their account, or some how catching it as it is sent through what ever pipe line it goes down.<br /><br />Ive personally had no problems or issues with that and I talk to my customers a lot. If you are just a small buyer then I wouldnt worry. If your selling as much as C63 then you might have to really be on top of all that lot but other wise, for regular users like our selves the SR security methods are probably safe enough.<br /><br />Can never be too careful but vendors get annoyed if messages with out sensitive information in them are encrypted it becomes a pain in the arse going through them. Hope this answers your question.

Anybody who hacks the servers can see it. Feds who physically seize the servers can see it.<br /><br />What you need, is end to end encryption. This means you have to use PGP, this is the only way for only you and the vendor to see the message.<br /><br />

				To clarify - staff can access and read messages when it is necessary to do so during an investigation of scamming or abuse or order issues.&nbsp; Even deleted messages.<br /><br />If you want your message only to be read by the vendor, you will need to encrypt it specifically to their PGP key.

				Excellent thread. I think its good practice to encrypt any communications with vendors. Lets say, for example, you want to ask a vendor about how they package their product or what their shipping schedules are. You would not want this communication to be seen by LE, because it establishes intent to purchase illegal contraband. Not that LE has access to any of these communications currently, but its just good practice to cover your ass just in case and not leave open the possibility that they could be read. <br /><br />A little extra safety never hurt anyone
