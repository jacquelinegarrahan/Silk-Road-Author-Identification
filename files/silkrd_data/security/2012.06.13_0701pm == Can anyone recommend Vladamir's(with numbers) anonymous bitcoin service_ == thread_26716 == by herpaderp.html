Hit me up so we can talk shop if you want, you are wandering into my area now and I&#039;m quite curious of your skills. ;)&nbsp; 8)

				I have never used his service but if I needed it he would be the one I use. He has helped me privately with a lot of newbie questions that I really needed that one on one help with. No scammer / con / bad business person would EVER spend their time giving this advice to someone for absolutely nothing, very nice (and professional) person to deal with.
