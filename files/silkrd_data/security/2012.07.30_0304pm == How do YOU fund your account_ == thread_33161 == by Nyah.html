				I just did my first bit-instant&gt;zip-zap&gt;bit-catapault transfer. 2 hours later, coins are in my account on SR. All told, it cost less than $4. Other than printing up the deposit slip and going to the store to make a deposit, I just had to enter my wallet address to transfer the funds. Painless, really.

				Ah i see, I didn&#039;t realize it was a normal thing for the process to be so strenuous. Filtering your money through multiple providers makes it harder to pinpoint its origin, At least.&nbsp; :)<br />@Vlad1m1r, I&#039;d do that if we shared the same physical cash currency. &gt;_&lt;<br />

				Maybe I&#039;m incorrect, but I dont see how obtaining btc via a SR vendor is all that secure and anonymous; sure, it may be a degree safer than other methods, but mostly it sounds more like vendor marketing, imho. <br /><br />You&#039;d have to have faith that the vendor does not have his/her bank account(s) flagged and monitored. I&#039;d personally be leery of entering a bank where you&#039;ll be recorded and often asked for identification and generally open to fingerprints and facial recognition via government databases (i.e. DMV). I&#039;m sure banks would be suspicious of accounts opened with dubious information (a vendor that opens a bank account with real information would be pretty stupid) that are reguarly receiving odd cash deposits around the country/world and then [presumably] transfered out to another account or cashed out. All of that screams suspicious activity and I have zero trust in banks to offer cover from law enforcement. <br /><br />If you have to enter a location to make a deposit, I&#039;d rather go to some convience store where the employees dont give a shit about anything and management is less likely to be in co-hoots with law enforcement and the account you&#039;ll be making a payment to isnt directly linked to SR. <br /><br />The best option would, in my opinion, would be cash in envelope mailed to a vendor like vlad1m1r and then sent to a bitcoin address and then obscured by a handful of places and then eventually making it&#039;s way to a dummy account on SR...and then transfered over to a SR account that you&#039;ll be making purchased with. <br /><br />If there is any thoughts on the matter, I&#039;d like to hear. Perhaps my understanding of the vendor thing is off-base and simply paranoid. <br /><br />Who offers such a cash-based service besides vlad1m1r, say, with non-Euro currency? I think that would be the ticket.

				I fund my account with a Bank Transfer(Via Dwolla)-&gt;Mt.Gox-&gt;SR Account.<br /><br />The way I see it is that no one can discern the difference between that and my day to day Bitcoin use. I mine bitcoin, and I buy and sell in bitcoin. So bitcoins are a part of my legal life as well as my illicit one. So how can they tell the difference? How do LE know that I didn&#039;t send those coins from Mt.Gox to a vendor and that&#039;s how I got my newly acquired Steam game, or that new comic book that came in the mail, or that new piece of electronic equipment, or some food(yes you can buy food in the mail with bitcoins. :P ).
