				This is slightly off-topic to the thread, but I didn&#039;t want to create a separate thread for one question.<br /><br />Is Blockchain alright to use on the Clearweb? Because I&#039;m trying to create an account on it, and since I have Java and some others disabled with Tor, I can&#039;t see the Captcha or even press &quot;Create&quot;.

If you want to remain anonymous, using Tor with JavaScript enabled is much better than connecting over clearnet. Just whitelist the domain blockchain.info.

				Wow...I seemed to have missed that button while looking everywhere...embarrassing<br /><br />What other sites do you recommend white-listing?<br /><br />And do I still have to enable Java to go through with viewing the Captcha and the &quot;continue&quot; button to work? haha

				None unless you absolutely need to use them. You should be using Bitcoin-QT or Electrum over Tor, although Electrum is only safe when using hidden service Electrum servers. There&#039;s a bug that bypasses Tor when connecting to clearnet servers. You don&#039;t need JavaScript at all to use desktop apps. :) But if you must use blockchain.info, Tor with JavaScript is better than clearnet.<br />

				I do, in fact, have Electrum and I plan on using it. Was just going to use Blockchain as another &quot;barrier&quot; or an additional part for security.<br /><br />Would I be fine transferring my BTC from Localbitcoins to the Fog, to Electrum, then to SR?<br /><br />That was my original plan, but thought why not add another little layer of security by using Blockchain?<br /><br />What do you think?

				The transaction fees may turn out to be less with more transactions, because a single transaction can be charged up to 3%, but with several transactions, the average across them tends to be about 2%.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have extra coins to split out, send them to different addresses in 2 or 3 transactions, several hours or days apart. For extra safety, you could withdraw part of them directly to your SR address and the other part to your Electrum address, then change your SR address and send the Electrum coins to SR.<br /><br />That would make it a lot harder to link the coins coming out from the coins going in, which would only require looking for coins going to address linked to the mixer worth 1-3% more than the coins coming out.<br /><br />BTW, you should edit out that bitcoin amount, because it&#039;s very specific and should be easy to identify in the block chain. We would be better off if we all used round numbers like 1.0 or increments of 0.1. That&#039;s how Zercoin will work.<br /><br />

Just changing the addresses and transferring them through Electrum and maybe 1 straight to my SR? Going straight to my SR kinda bothers me though, haha.

				No, they still go through Fog.<br /><br />Whatever wallet they are in now, they go to 2 or 3 different Fog addresses. Then coming out, part of them go directly to an SR address, the other part go to an Electrum address, and then a different SR address.<br />

				Yeah, that will work.<br /><br />The whole point is so anyone watching the mixer doesn&#039;t see:<br /><br />1.327 BTC -&gt; mixer -&gt; (2 or 3 transactions to same address) -&gt; 1.327 * (0.97 to 0.99)<br /><br />That would be relatively easy traffic analysis.<br />

				Once the amount shows up in my BTC Fog Wallet, does that mean it&#039;s safe to transfer elsewhere?
