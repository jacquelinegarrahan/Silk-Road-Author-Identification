				Nothing, the idea behind encrypting your hard drive is that any file or program stored there is indecipherable to anyone with out the correct passphrase, even if they remove the hard drive and hook it up to a different system to inspect it.&nbsp; That&#039;s not to say an attacker can&#039;t obtain your passphrase through a range of methods (keyloggers, bruteforcing, cold boot attacks being probably the most common).<br /><br />Tor is an onion router that sends your outbound traffic through a series of proxies with encryption at each hop.&nbsp; The effect is that if you visit say amazon.com using tor, amazon.com will not be able to tell where that traffic is coming from, because they will only see the IP address of the last hop.&nbsp; Tor is meant to give you anonymity.<br /><br />I&#039;m over simplifying both of these points (and I am a definite non-expert), but it is a huge mistake to think that computer security ends with Tor Browser.

				You should certainly encrypt your entire disk. It is more important to use GPG for communications and Tor to protect from traffic analysis, but FDE can protect from sloppy attackers in certain circumstances. At the end of the day if you are a primary suspect and your attacker has the slightest clue what they are doing, Truecrypt will not protect you much, but if they have no clue what they are doing it could save your ass, and if you are a vendor it could save the asses of all of your customers. Usually they have no clue what they are doing too :).

				I hear you buddy! I think the program Truecrypt is the easiest one to set up to encrypt your entire hard disk - the website itself contains some really simple step by step guides in the documentation section. If you get stuck I have a link to a video somewhere I can dig out which shows how to encrypt your machine, it is very easy - if it weren&#039;t I couldn&#039;t do it! <br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23659.msg248154#msg248154">Quote from: Wonderland on May 19, 2012, 04:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have the same worries as you, man!

				I don&#039;t agree with the above. If you are a buyer and you are just using TOR to access SR then there is no need for encryption it actually makes you more suspicious.<br /><br />NOTE: this is only the case if the only thing on your computer is TOR browser bundle.<br /><br />I only have that on my computer. I used to have truecrypt, eraser etc but then i realized that if they were going to bust me it&#039;s just going to make things worse for me because why would some small time buyer have a whole HDD encrypted...<br /><br />It&#039;s also not illegal to have Browser bundle on your computer... just say you use it to search things about STD or something...<br /><br />Just make sure to memorize the SR url and never bookmark anything and your good to go :) <br /><br />If you got PGP software on your computer i would advice to use encryption as the private key can identify you.<br /><br />Once you close TOR everything you did is gone; history etc<br /><br /><br />

				Your right truecrypt is not the best protection, all it takes is a judge to demand your password. And sometimes even if you give it they could say you have a hidden os, say your holding out on the second password and still put you&#039;re ass behind bars. But don&#039;t get me wrong doing everything on a unprotected system with no security in place Is just dumb whether you bookmark silkroad or not. You&#039;ll just make the cops day. So if your a buyer or a seller you should still have a good plan. I guess it&#039;s just a matter of whether you think the time it takes to learn this is worth keeping your ass out of jail. I think the best thing to do is use tails or liberte Linux. If runs in your computers ram and wipes everything when your done. Also try to keep your files in a truecrypt container with a decoy container on a server in a place like Switzerland.

				Full disk encryption is a layer of security and indeed could end up being your last one.<br /><br />When you consider how trivial it is for your ISP to see you are using Tor and the fact if you&#039;re arrested your computer can be seized it becomes a matter of common sense to make sure that no further evidence ends up in the hands of LEO.<br /><br />Truecrypt is by no means the only FDE program - the alternate install of Ubuntu for instance allows you to encrypt your entire OS. Liberte linux is also encrypted by its very nature and can be fitted onto a USB stick.<br /><br />I have some experience with digital forensics. Although the Tor browser bundle is designed to resist data recovery in this way a detailed analysis of your hard drive may reveal clues as to your browsing activity - indeed if you&#039;re worried about seeming suspicious its very presence on your machine seems more compelling to me than an encrypted HDD, particularly if you have any book marks to SR or these forums saved in the browser!<br /><br />In addition if your PGP keys are stored on the machine, your private key would be compromised. Admittedly the key itself is encrypted but asymmetric encryption is a lot easier to break than symmetric encryption.<br /><br />For anyone worried about being compelled to hand over their password, Plausible Deniability allows you to have two passwords - analysis of a TC partition in itself will not reveal a hidden volume.<br /><br />V.

(Admittedly the Tor browser goes to some lengths to delete these).<br /><br />Also your book marks, and book mark back ups - would you want LEO to see you had a bookmark to your favourite vendor on SR on your PC, particularly if you&#039;re trying to plead in court you have ABSOLUTELY no idea that the package sent to your house contained drugs when you signed for it?<br /><br />Your cache is once again erased in theory when you exit the Tor Browser correctly but can be recovered using freely downloadable tools from the internet if you fail to use encryption. It contains information about the URL&#039;s you&#039;ve accessed and how many times you&#039;ve done this.<br /><br />This is such an open and shut issue, it surprises me that people (including more senior members who should know better!) think it&#039;s a matter of opinion - encrypting your entire OS, be it on a USB stick or your hard drive is a matter of common sense.<br /><br />The only time I wouldn&#039;t recommend it is if you use a SSD as it can reduce the life of the drive.<br /><br />V.

				Yeah having an encrypted disk is going to look real good in front of the Jury. Especially after you have revealed the password of the dummy OS with some nasty porn &quot;hidden&quot; on there that u supposedly tried to hide with your truecrypt encryption but everyone knows it is the wrong password. What is the Dept of Justice suggesting? Maybe even child pornography?! Hidden on that disk?! 2 layers of encryption??<br /><br />Or they manage to seize your computer while it&#039;s still on (laptops!!) and perform a cold booth attack and manage to break into the volume and find your private key and SR bookmarks maybe some decrypted text files etc because you thought you were safe.<br /><br />TOR is designed not to keep any records whatsoever of your browser session, peoples lives could depend on it (think about some activist using it to fight a regime or something). <br /><br />Sometimes i think overkill is also not good if it&#039;s not necessary.

				I don&#039;t know where to start on how wrong this is.<br /><br />Firstly having an encrypted hard disk is a very common practice - the Police do this themselves on their home machines and hand held devices.<br /><br />As for a hidden volume, as I said Truecrypt is specifically designed so that an analysis of the encrypted contents of the drive will not reveal whether there is one or not.<br /><br />There is no way to know it was the wrong password provided you have set it up correctly and avoid certain applications which can &quot;leak&quot; data to unencrypted parts of your HDD. Details available on request.<br /><br />A cold boot attack is possible but they&#039;re hardly going to need to do that if you leave your entire system unencrypted - why not just hand your laptop in while you&#039;re at it, save them the petrol.<br /><br />How can you be so naive?<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23659.msg249139#msg249139">Quote from: registration on May 19, 2012, 09:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah having an encrypted disk is going to look real good in front of the Jury.

				Just another suggestion that I think works well...<br /><br />I run Liberte from a micro SD card.&nbsp; It&#039;s about the size of my fingernail.&nbsp; I can literally hide it anywhere, or destroy it in an instant, even eat it if I had to, and it is the ONLY way I access SR.&nbsp; I boot from it using a card reader, and there is another encrypted micro SD card with nothing incriminating on it to be used for a decoy.<br /><br />My laptop is always out in the open.&nbsp; There are always a couple of encrypted USB sticks laying around next to it.&nbsp; If the shit ever hits the fan, my laptop and USB drives are going to be the obvious prizes, but they contain nothing to incriminate me.<br /><br />By the time a judge could issue a subpoena forcing me to divulge my passwords ( I would remain silent and refuse until ordered to) the real prize will be long gone and nowhere to be found.

				OK, I didn&#039;t want to have to get technical about this as it&#039;s a little unfair on everyone else but so be it.<br /><br />Firstly, the Tor browser is designed with the ultimate goal of not leaving any fingerprints on the host Operating System -they frankly admit they haven&#039;t achieved this yet, by all means take a look at their page:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#security<br /><br />You&#039;ll see that they link to a number of sites designed to test your privacy, one of which is browserspy.dk which will clearly show your browser retains cookies.<br /><br />By default Javascript is enabled in the Torbrowser which can leak your IP information and there are plans for supporting flash objects.<br /><br />The Tor project also posts a link to a site which contains scripts which can also detect the presence of the Torbutton and reveal your history to a limited extent, although admittedly this could be done remotely, not by seizing your machine:<br /><br />http://pseudo-flaw.net/content/tor/torbutton/<br /><br />When it comes to security less is not more, more is more. <br /><br />None of this means you shouldn&#039;t make sure to keep updating to the latest version of Tor browser to prevent remote exploits, but as I said encrypting the partition on which you keep your Tor browser bundle is a matter of common sense.<br /><br />Those people who have read my posts will know I&#039;m not given to paranoia or stupidity, I honestly believe the only way to be sure forensic recovery of your browsing activities cannot take place is to keep your web browsing application out of reach - this is not a particularly sensational point of view and I&#039;m by no means the first person to say it!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23659.msg249174#msg249174">Quote from: registration on May 19, 2012, 10:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s naive about saying that if you surf the web using TOR browser and don&#039;t add anything to your bookmarks and don&#039;t download anything once you close TOR browser everything about that particular session is GONE and IRRETRIEVABLE.<br /><br />That&#039;s what TOR stands for.

				This is turning into a bit of a yes it is / no it isn&#039;t discussion but I&#039;m more than happy to go toe to toe with someone on this.<br /><br />This is the page for the latest implementation of the Tor Browser Bundle released less than a month ago. It&#039;s so recent I don&#039;t many SR users will have upgraded - I didn&#039;t myself until yesterday.<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-16<br /><br />Have a look at this feature which was recently fixed:<br /><br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4017<br /><br />As you can see for certain users, even with the configuration set not to retain a memory of downloaded files e.g a text file of a person&#039;s PGP key, or an image of a product you want to buy, could be recovered. As if this wasn&#039;t bad enough, take a gander at this comment on the thread for the latest release:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">hello:<br /><br />hope this message gets to the right people. its about flash cookies and tor security.<br /><br />installed newest tor package on osx, latest built.<br /><br />after a little test-surfing the web i installed the &quot;better privacy&quot; plugin in tor-browser to see what flash does to the tor browser.<br /><br />&quot;better privacy&quot; listed a douzand flash cookies in user/...../library/preferences/macromedia, including a skype cookie and the default flash player cookie.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yet another vulnerability which was fixed in a previous version and has now resurfaced is the persistence of evercookies. Fortunately this has been fixed for now:<br /><br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5715<br /><br />I could go on all day (and will if you try to insist the Tor Browser does not leave traces of browsing activity!) - In theory all traces of browsing activity are erased when you use the Tor Browser Bundle - in practice as you can see this is not the case.<br /><br />Simple solution : encrypt the partition where it is installed. Perhaps now I&#039;ve said it five times this will penetrate? :-D<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23659.msg249221#msg249221">Quote from: registration on May 19, 2012, 11:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you read the document they cleary state that if a feature is not entirely support they deactivate it entirely.

				Hi Sl1pknot,<br /><br />Thanks for your message - I am hoping the fact that the very team tasked with finding exploits and vulnerabilities in Tor believe disk encryption is a good idea will clinch the issue but I won&#039;t hold my breath - no one ever won an argument!<br /><br />To answer your question I did use to have a Mac and Truecrypt will allow you to encrypt your entire Operating System with it. You can also create a hidden OS if that&#039;s what you want. The Truecrypt bootloader which actually asks for your password and decrypts the hard drive can&#039;t be encrypted so it would be possible to tell you&#039;ve encrypted the drive. I would still recommend you do this, as it&#039;s useful in case the laptop is stolen and as I said provides another layer of security against LEO.<br /><br />Onto question No. 2 - the advantage of encrypting an entire USB with a program like Truecrypt is that the data is indistinguishable from the kind of data you might find if you used a special program like Eraser to delete everything on your USB - such programs overwrite deleted data with random bits of information, which are extremely similar to encrypted data.<br /><br />Another advantage is that you can encrypt a USB stick with several different ciphers but if you do this on a hard drive it can slow performance.<br /><br />If the Police ask about the USB you can simply tell them you&#039;ve wiped it and certainly in the UK at least they wouldn&#039;t be able to gainsay you. How do I know this? Because I did what you&#039;ve suggested here by having a USB drive encrypted with the good old 128 Bit Blowfish encryption algorithim - they kept it for 4 weeks before handing it back in disgust!<br /><br />As for TAILS - I think they&#039;re currently patching a security hole in this. If you do use it, I&#039;d recommend you install the VirtualBox software on your Mac and install TAILS onto a virtual machine. Once again I recommend encrypting your Mac&#039;s hard drive, though TAILS allows you to do an encrypted install too and is very easy to set up.<br /><br />For now, I think you&#039;ll be fine encrypting your MacOS and having your Tor Browser Bundle / GPG software on an encrypted USB.<br /><br />If you need any help, feel free to send me a message.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23659.msg249257#msg249257">Quote from: sl1pknot on May 19, 2012, 11:44 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Registration is totally an LEO and wants everyone to stay unencrypted so we can get locked up more easily.

They are talking about a physical attack as in they kick your door in and there you are with your TOR browser open I just have it open when I am using it once i´m gone i´ll close the browser. They recommend locking you encrypted workstation so that they cannot read it but if you close your TOR browser there is not a lot left to read (Given you don&#039;t save anything that is!). TorBOX also encourages encryption because you can save things from your session within the VM. It&#039;s a completely different project not even affiliated to TOR besides that it uses Vidalia. I would never trust them.<br /><br />I would say TAILS, or LIBERTE is your best bet. It accommodates security through not having anything suspicious on the USB disk as every trace of your session is completely wiped clean.<br /><br />I am not saying TrueCrypt is not safe but if they really want to access it they will, and then they find all kinds of evidence. Whilst using TAILS &amp; your memory there is not a lot to prove even if they find the TAILS usb stick since when is that illegal? There are plenty of legitimate uses for it.<br /><br />The point I&#039;m trying to make is that persistence in any form whatsoever is no security.&nbsp; Also using your Tor browser don&#039;t go wild and only use .onion sites. <br /><br />Furthermore if they find your private key on your computer they know who you are on the onion web :) so they can identify you and proof you are that particular person that is selling on SR as you have your public key in your profile..... <br /><br />You think they would really recommend Tor for anonymity if it fills your system with unwanted cookies and saves data to your hard disk that can incriminate you after your TOR session.... <br /><br />Use the internet use the clouds to hide your sensitive information everything through the tor network is encrypted end-to-end especially if you only use .onion.<br /><br />There are to many attacks against Truecrypt but you guys can research that yourself :) <br /><br />Read this through: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en<br /><br />I know you are English vlad1m1r so you should be able to comprehend it also I know you accept cash in the mail so it would be quite easy for adversary to discover your location (if your not using a PO box but even then...) also you are building up a reputation through a forum account which in theory could be used against you. I bet you got SR bookmarked and the forums and your private key within your hidden volume :) Probably some decrypted files as well who knows. Your security appears to be one big leakage. I hope for you that you really buy those coins with every envelope that comes in but my commonsense tells me you are selling coins from vendors :)

Liberte Linux by its nature encrypts the partition on which the OS is installed using OTFE and allows for a persistent install. A password is required on boot up to decrypt the OS - just like I have been saying all along. <br /><br />&quot;Liberté Linux maintains persistent storage on an OTFE volume accessible via ~/persist — a virtual partition file that is located on the boot media where Liberté is installed. This volume uses AES-256 cipher in XTS block mode, with SHA-256 header hashing. It is best to store all documents on this OTFE volume. In addition, Liberté provides automatic on-demand mounting of permanent and removable media at /media. You are advised to employ extreme care when writing to such non-encrypted media. Specifically, it is recommended to avoid writing to the non-encrypted parts of the boot media, especially since the OTFE partition is fully resizable with sudo otfe-resize. &quot;<br /><br />Source : http://http://dee.su/liberte-security<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Furthermore if they find your private key on your computer they know who you are on the onion web :) so they can identify you and proof you are that particular person that is selling on SR as you have your public key in your profile..... <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...If you encrypt the partition on which your private key is installed they won&#039;t be able to do this, stop me if I&#039;m getting too technical :-)<br /><br />[quote[<br />You think they would really recommend Tor for anonymity if it fills your system with unwanted cookies and saves data to your hard disk that can incriminate you after your TOR session.... <br />[/quote]<br /><br />This is circular logic. The implementation of Firefox contained in the Tor browser bundle is not supposed to leave any traces but there are various flaws inherent to its design (three of which I&#039;ve already stated) which means there is a possibility of data recovery on an unencrypted OS.

				Ok, one more time, obviously my last post was a bit weighty...<br /><br />The quotations you&#039;ve cited are stated GOALS for the Tor Project- I have already shown evidence of where information is retained on a hard drive after closing the browser - you might have to use the scroll button to use these.<br /><br />If as an alternative to encrypting your drives you use a liveCD such as TAILS to browse the web (although this was not what you were advocating originally - still hats off to you for struggling to hang in there!), this might protect you from keyloggers but you&#039;d be just as vulnerable to a cold boot attack if your entire OS was loaded into RAM, so by your own logic this wouldn&#039;t do much good!<br /><br />Having said this, it does admittedly have the advantage and disadvantage of not allowing you to record anything permanently on your hard drive - I say disadvantage as this means you would have to trust a third party with your Bitcoin wallet, bookmarks and indeed your Private Keys, let&#039;s see how that worked out for Hushmail users:<br /><br />http://cryptogon.com/?p=16002<br /><br />Or as I said (sixth time now!) you can generate your own key pair offline and safely store your private key on an encrypted drive on your machine.<br /><br />Is there anyone else here who does this i.e keeps their private key on a cloud somewhere as opposed to keeping it safely encrypted on their machine?

Forensic recovery of deleted data is always possible and you&#039;ve seen three examples of data being retained even after the browser is closed. If you would like me to give you a 101 on how deleted cookies and so on can be recovered I suggest you sign up to the &quot;Linux Forensics&quot; group on Yahoo where we regularly discuss digital forensic processes and procedures - most recently one of our users efforts to retrieve a person&#039;s browsing history failed because a user had taken the very sensible step of encrypting their home folder and installing a browser there.<br /><br />I am more than happy to do a 101 on how commonly used distros like DEFT Linux can be used to recover deleted data, it would do you no harm to actually learn a thing or two but I feel that you&#039;d be best served spending a month or two brushing up on some of the fundamentals of IT Security and Applied Cryptography before we move on to anything more advanced, I wouldn&#039;t want to overburden you. :-)<br /><br />Of course you&#039;ve gone one step further and apparently are saying now that even your GPG private key should be stored remotely - where did you have in mind exactly? I have to tell you you&#039;re flying in the face of a number of Security experts in saying your secret key should ever leave your PC:<br /><br />Try this one for size from the IT Dept of Harvard:<br /><br />&quot;...First and foremost, do not place your private key in your seas provided home directory (either on unix or windows). The file storage system is not designed to secure this type of identity information. Your private key should be stored only on machines that you have physical access to, and that you regularly use.&quot;<br /><br />(Source : https://intranet.seas.harvard.edu/it/standards-and-best-practices/)<br /><br />If that&#039;s not August enough for you, let&#039;s see if Microsoft believe that your private key leaving your machine is a good idea:<br /><br />&quot;The security of private keys is crucial for public key cryptosystems. Anyone who can obtain a private key can use it to impersonate the rightful owner during all communications and transactions on intranets or on the Internet. Therefore, private keys must be in the possession only of authorized users, and they must be protected from unauthorized use.<br /><br />...An attacker with access to a computer might use low-level disk utilities to locate encrypted private keys on the hard disk and perform cryptanalysis to decipher the key. In general, the risk of attacks on private keys is much lower when keys are stored on tamper resistant hardware devices such as smart cards.&quot;<br /><br />(Source: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962023.aspx)<br /><br />As you can see Microsoft go one step further and suggest using hardware based encryption.<br /><br />Two pioneering researchers at Cambridge University have actually postulated on keeping your secret keys in the Cloud in a research paper back in 2010. Their solution is a promising one in theory but considering your advocating Hushmail, I have my doubts this was what you had in mind:<br /><br />https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jra40/publications/2010-SPW-key-storage.pdf<br /><br />So what exactly is it that you&#039;re trying to pull here? Is this a pride thing? There&#039;s no shame in admitting you&#039;ve made a mistake, I forgive, so will Jesus! (Or at least he would if he existed!)<br /><br />This sort of nonsense is confusing people newer to the forums and needs to stop right away - if you use a third party to store your encryption keys and other personal information online you&#039;re gambling with your own safety which is fine. Encouraging others to do the same is plain irresponsible.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				A few more string to add to the proverbial bow:<br /><br />This c/o the OS Forensics website:<br /><br />A detailed list of registry keys which can be examined on an unencrypted OS to show that the Tor Browser was present on the system even after uninstallation:<br /><br />http://www.osforensics.com/faqs-and-tutorials/identifying_uninstalled_software.html<br /><br />This one care of Andrew Case of Digital Forensic Solutions who was investigating ways to de anonymise use of the TAILS Live CD:<br /><br />“Memory analysis of Tor revealed that it makes minimal effort to securely erase memory after it has been used and this allows recovery of historical data such as HTTP headers and requests, downloaded files, visited URLs, and Tor-specific data such as the identity of other Tor network nodes. We also show that the research performed and tools developed during this project are applicable against a number of other live CD distributions and not just TAILS.”<br /><br />Another extract:<br /><br />“4 Memory Analysis of Tor<br /><br />In order to fully deconstruct the defensive systems of the TAILS distribution, we also chose to perform memory analysis of Tor. <br /><br />...<br /><br />The combination of filesystem and Tor memory analysis attacks the two key components that TAILS and other live CD offer for anti-forensics. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Before deep analysis of Tor was performed, the classic forensics technique of using strings and grep to find interesting information was performed on memory dumps of the Tor process to ensure that useful information is indeed not overwritten on deallocation. <br /><br />To test this we installed the privoxy proxy server, configured it to send requests through Tor, and then set the http_proxy environment variable to the address of the prixovy server. Once this was completed, we then used wget to recursively download information from a number of websites, all of which contained tens of web pages, downloads (doc, pdf, etc), and other information. <br /><br />To verify that this information was still in Tor’s memory after the requests were completed, we used Michal Zalewski’s memfetch [11] utility to<br />download memory regions of the Tor process such as the heap, .data segment, and .bss segment. strings and grep were then run across the extracted memory regions and it was confirmed that information such as the HTTP headers,file and web pages contents, virtual hosts of requested pages, and more were contained in clear text in memory.&quot;<br /><br />(Source : http://media.blackhat.com/bh-dc-11/Case/BlackHat_DC_2011_Case_De-Anonymizing_Live_CDs-wp.pdf) <br /><br /><br />TLDR :&nbsp; Using a Live CD will not protect you from forensic analysis of your machine and it is inadvisable to store your private key anywhere except on a machine to which you have physical access - all of the above forensic analysis of Tor could not have been done on a system with an encrypted drive. <br /><br />While disk encryption is only a layer of defence and not 100% immune from attacks, as I&#039;ve said already it&#039;s a vital one. At the very least you should have your Tor Browser and GPG keyring stored on an encrypted USB.<br /><br />V.

				I find it ironic that each time I&#039;ve proven you wrong, you&#039;ve accused me of quoting out of context, now let&#039;s take a gander at the single link you&#039;ve provided, particularly as the supposed warnings have to do with making sure your partition remains encrypted:<br /><br />&quot;The persistent volume is not hidden. An attacker in possession of the USB stick can know that there is a persistent volume on it.

				A. Tor browser can and almost certainly will leave recoverable traces on your drive, if you don&#039;t encrypt SWAP this is even more likely to happen<br /><br />B. FDE can save the day and has many times....<br /><br />C. If the person after you knows or suspects you are using FDE they will with high probability be able to get around it, there are plenty of cases of LE carrying out cold boot attacks and using other passphrase stealing tactics against targets they know to be using FDE.<br /><br />It really boils down to yes of course use FDE, but also be aware that is is a very limited technology. IMO FDEs primary threat model is to keep your information safe if a thief steals your corporate laptop, it is not really meant by itself to keep you safe if some highly trained LE forensics people are after you.&nbsp; However, if some unskilled LE agency is after you it could very well save your ass because they just shut down computers and send them off to the lab, they don&#039;t have forensics specialists on site for every raid. They don&#039;t have enough computer forensics specialists to send one to every raid and their average door kicker agent isn&#039;t going to be trained to properly deal with FDE. Pwning a target with FDE requires serious tactical planning and computer forensic / technical knowledge (at least enough to install a key logger, at most enough to analyze transient electromagnetic information leakage), not everyone who gets raided has these sort of resources aimed against them, but if you do chances are high your FDE will be bypassed unless you take exceptional counter measures.

				I&#039;m not sure how much this applies to the topic, but I thought it did somewhat....for Americans anyway. I thought the article was interesting, although alarming for those living in the US.&nbsp; A mortgage fraud defendant looking at possibly decades in prison if convicted was ordered by a US district court judge to decrypt her laptop within the month. <br />(I hope I&#039;m understanding correctly that with a link posted here, as long as a person cuts and pastes the link into their browser,&nbsp; it&#039;s safe. Whereas clicking on it right from this site is not even when using TOR. Hope I&#039;m correct on that. If I&#039;m not please correct me)<br /><br />&nbsp; http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/02/laptop-decryption-appeal-rejected/<br /><br />So in the US anyway, if they really want you, especially if it&#039;s a federal rap, it seems they&#039;ll really turn on the heat. I&#039;m assuming for someone buying small amounts though they wouldn&#039;t spend the money to go whole hog on prosecuting. For sellers it might be a different story though. Seems encryption possibly isn&#039;t going to be enough<br /><br />The next month the judges order was basically a moot point as the Feds got into the laptop as explained in the report in the next link. It&#039;s presumed her co-accused provided the passwords. Figures!!!&nbsp; Nine times out of ten it seems that&#039;s the case...someone talks<br />http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/02/decryption-flap-mooted/?utm_source=Contextly&amp;utm_medium=RelatedLinks&amp;utm_campaign=MoreRecently<br /><br />Oops! Didn&#039;t realize this thread was so old. Sorry.&nbsp; Still might be prudent info though
