				Hey guys im deleting all possible evidence and starting again.<br /><br /><br />Any ideas on which computer and steps i should take to make it as secure as possible? ie full disk encryption, tails. I plan to have a computer for personal use, and a laptop just for the future of SR, whatever it turns out to be!<br /><br /><br />thanks

				So you want 2 different computers?<br /><br />You could do this on one with proper partitioning. <br /><br />-Full disk encryption.&nbsp; I would recommend running tails in a virtual machine, not as a main OS. Remember you can always encrypt stuff more then once.<br /><br />I use a Virtual Machine kept inside an encrypted partition - then inside the VM everything is again encrypted. Both have totally different complex keys I memorized.<br /><br />You also have to know how to utilize VPNs - I&#039;m not really going to go into tons of detail on that as there&#039;s literally thousands of Blackhat sites that cover how to use them safely.<br /><br />If you want to take it a step even further, buy a wifi antenna, and use someone elses signal for illegal activity, on-top of the other security, of course.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I could go further but I really don&#039;t know how secure you need to be.&nbsp; What exactly are you trying to hide? If you&#039;re just buying personal amounts of drugs this is all absolutely unnecessary, but if your moving m16s to&nbsp; Islamic Militants, you&#039;ll probably need a bit more.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=219451.msg1596229#msg1596229">Quote from: White 0ut on October 09, 2013, 01:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just went Mac &amp; don&#039;t plan on going back, anyone have any encryption tips?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Install Windows on your Mac.

I would just be wanting to keep all my sensitive info (such as tor, passwords, certain programs gpg etc encrypted) safe. I currently have a mac and use true crypt, but they dont allow full disk encryption on macs. And after the SR bust i just want to start again. <br /><br />I do realise that tor is legal, but would rather have it not in clear view. <br /><br />I will look in to these black hat VPN&#039;s tutorials you speak of! thanks matey

				Don&#039;t search &quot;blackhat&quot; vpn exactly, because none will advertise them as such. I just refer to them as &quot;blackhat&quot; because they&#039;re mostly used in hacking communities.&nbsp; <br />A good VPN will surely NOT be hosted in America or other country with strict internet laws.&nbsp; Logless VPNs often come from Eastern European countries, the most common I&#039;ve seen are from the Netherlands, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia.<br />If they accept credit card, it is very suspicious.&nbsp; If they offer any kind of reoccurring payment do not use it as that means they log payment info.<br /><br />The most important thing is - don&#039;t be cheap.&nbsp; There are tons of great fast VPNs for $4 that&#039;ll hide your IP but get you arrested in a second.&nbsp; Also learn how to use them properly. NEVER login to an account with a VPN that you logged into with your real IP.&nbsp; That&#039;ll make it practically worthless.

It is healthier as well :)<br /><br />Just search with startpage or duckduckgo about these topics and you will find a lot.<br /><br />Cheers!
