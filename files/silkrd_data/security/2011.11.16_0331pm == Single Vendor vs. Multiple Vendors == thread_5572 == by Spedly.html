				In real life I&#039;m the definition of a &quot;loyal customer.&quot; Although I am new, at some point my very nature will want me to establish a business relationship with a single vendor. But I wonder how secure that philosophy is here on SR. I&#039;d be interested in reading your opinion on this. Is it more secure to spread orders across multiple sellers? Or stick to one, trusted vendor?<br /><br />I am only interested in dealing with vendors from my own country and have no desire to purchase anything other than cannabis products. I&#039;m a middle-aged professional with a very successful career and do not want to draw attention to myself. All my purchases would be for personal use and I can never see myself buying more than an oz. at a time. I&#039;m a light, but daily &quot;after the wife and kids go to bed&quot; smoker so an ounce lasts me a few months.<br /><br />So, what are your thoughts? Fairly large amounts from a single vendor ordered quarterly? Or smaller amounts ordered more frequently from multiple vendors?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				It all depends on what you&#039;re buying.<br /><br />I used to do a little bit of coke once in a while, but only before meals.<br /><br />If I was in the market for coke now, and I found a vendor with a consistently high quality product, I&#039;d never use another vendor.<br /><br />Weed and hash, however, are a completely different game.<br /><br />I&nbsp; buy from absolutely fucking everyone. I&#039;m in the UK, and I&#039;ve had smoke sent from here, the EU and the states; sometimes I have it sent here, and quite a few times I get someone I know local to order and forward it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t dealt with any weed vendors here yet that I&#039;d never deal with a second time, so far. I&#039;ve dealt with a few that are going to see a lot of repeat business. Right now, I&#039;ve got 7 orders from 4 countries on the way. Usually grams or eighths, occasionally a quarter if it&#039;s something I&#039;ve tried before and really like. I&#039;m a med user, and there is nothing in the world that is worse than building a terrific tolerance to some cannabis that you have a good line on. Changing it up and around often inhibits tolerance, and gives me a choice of a smoke depending on how I&#039;m feeling. Do I want a little pain relief, or do I want to hit on a pure indica that is going to knock me out for the night, and give me good long rest.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for just one thing consistently, find the best vendor for your needs. Otherwise, expand your horizons and nibble a bit on all the chocolates.<br /><br />Of course, with me, it&#039;s all about the variety.
