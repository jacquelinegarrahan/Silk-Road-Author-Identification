				If I am able to list an ad without having to pay, does that mean that since my account was created when seller accounts were open that I dont have to pay a seller account fee?<br /><br />I have been able to list an ad without having to buy a sellers account.

				No! Send me 15 bitcoins ASAP!!!<br /><br />Im kidding, if you made your account and made it into a sellers account a little more than a month ago, then it was free.. I wouldn&#039;t be complaining, now that the admins now know of the mistake, if there was one, lol...<br /><br />There are 2 ways to get a sellers account. Buy one outright (around 150 usd) or the auction every 48hrs. if you did neither, then I would assume you made your sellers account before they started charging..<br /><br />I just looked at your account and you made it about 2 months ago, so that tells me you got your sellers account before SR started charging. Count your blessings...
