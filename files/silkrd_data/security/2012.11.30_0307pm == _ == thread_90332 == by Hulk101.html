				Hey, i&#039;ve got the same question and walking through the forum i could find nothing about it. There where however some threads about anonymus bitcoin exchange in some countries, but really, is there any general method of doing that wherever you are, or am i just missunderstanding something?

				It depends by country on the methods you should use, but here is a recent discussion directed towards people looking for BTC in USA.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=88896.0<br /><br />As for anonymity, if you are serious about it, do not ever link it to your bank account. And be sure to roll them through a few wallets before they get to SR, most likely not necessary, but it can never hurt. <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s a complete list of exchanges: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade

				Another way of washing is through a service such as Bitcoin Fog http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br /><br /><br />Modzi

				Oops it seems my post on Dwolla duplicates this. But basically the same issue. You say don&#039;t link your identity to your account but that seems impossible, unless you go to a MoneyGrams place where they forget to ask for your ID (but there are cameras all over the place). How many times can you do that before they figure out you are using a false identity to wire money. That might be even worse crime than we think. Since purchasing BTC is not illegal, I rather buy them legitimately using my bank account and THEN using the wonderful BTCs make it impossible to trace back to me. How many times do I have to transfer my BTCs to distant my self from my real identity and bank account? What about the local exchanges through CL?
