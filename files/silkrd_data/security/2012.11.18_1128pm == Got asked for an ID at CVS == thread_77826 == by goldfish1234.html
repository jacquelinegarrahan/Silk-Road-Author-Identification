				Hi<br />first time poster and i have a question regarding getting btc<br />the method i used for bitcoins was that used the moneygram method from which i transferred money from my local store to bitinstant to mtgox to SR.<br />I always made sure i put false info while putting money through moneygram but it turns out the employees in the store are asking for my ID now, would it be ok to use my actual info while putting money through moneygram? <br />im pretty sure there would be no way to track as long as i send my btc through bitinstant, mt gox, and use pgp when buying from SR. is this safe using my actual info for moneygram?

Usually there are loads of locations in any city; most of them probably wouldn&#039;t ask for ID.<br /><br />the beauty of this method is that if you transfer the money using false info, even in the unlikely event that all your tumblers/wallets/etc are all compromised by LE, your anonymity remains intact. On the other hand, in the also unlikely event that your real info is somehow obtained, your tumblers will hide where the bitcoin is going to. I would think twice before giving up this highly secure strategy.

				I wouldn&#039;t want my name and id linked to buying bitcoins. Also bitintstant has been sketchy lately as it.&nbsp; Get a fake if they are going to start doing this and you want to buy bitcoins from them.
