				yeah, &#039;the noob&#039;<br />was doing things right...running TOR Liberte&nbsp; etc from a USB....tumbled BTCs into SR wallet....hold off on ordering until I have mastered PGP...didnt keep SR URL in bookmarks so searched for it and pulled this up http://silkroadv5p5cbl6.onion/ . Was about to post here and ask WTF with the &#039;server maintenance&#039; for the last 5 days?&#039;...then did some more digging. Log in and see from my SR account history that the account was emptied on on the 8th Jan. Not by me, obv...<br />I guess the kicker was asking for the Pin. Being new round here, and seeing so much convo around &#039;pins&#039;, &#039;pin resets&#039; and &#039;pin requests&#039;, the phish seemed legit.<br />Nothing I can do about it right?

Your coins are gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />If people can only keep one thing in mind it should be this: THE REAL SR SITE WILL NOT ASK FOR YOUR PIN FOR YOU TO LOGIN.&nbsp; Any site that asks for your PIN to login is a phishing site.&nbsp; Either bookmark or memorize the site URL -- searching for it on the net all too often leads to being ripped-off like this. <br /><br />Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP-Key: 4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22<br />Key fingerprint = D870 C6AC CC6E 46B0 E0C7 3955 B8F1 D88E BBF7 433B<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />
