				Eager to place my first order, but I need some bitcoins first! I was thinking Bitinstant, or BlueSkyTraders possibly.<br /><br />Any other suggestions? I&#039;d like the process to be as quick and simple as possible. Need me some coinage

				I use bitinstant and do cash to BTC at walmart. I always use fake information so it&#039;s 100% anonymous. They wont ask for your ID so don&#039;t worry about that. It never took more than an hour and a half for my BTC to end up in my SR wallet. Best way in my opinion, but then again it&#039;s the only way I&#039;ve done it. Best of luck to ya!<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Something to consider when using Bitinstant to do cash to BTC at Walmart. The phone number you use on the Money Gram must match the name you&#039;ve put on the order, or you start getting questions about that from the clerk. You&#039;ll also have to sign a receipt, which i hate doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have a Bank of America in your area, it would be faster if you went with BlueSkyTraders and more anonymous. You&#039;ll need to ask for an out of state deposit slip when you&#039;re at the bank, use the drive through. <br /><br />I feel the best way, in terms of anonymity,&nbsp; is to get a GreenDot MoneyPak, Vanilla Reload or what ever the vendor will accept. Then contact a vendor that will let you trade that card amount, usually minimum $100, for BTC to your SR account. Fast and easy. Good luck!

				No prob.. just be sure to use an alias that you wont forget details of.. I use the same alias for anything i dont use my real info for.. along with a old phone number, and a DOB thats slightly dif from mine, as not to forget.. I use an old address as well.. moneygram keeps it all on file, so its easiest to use the same info each time.

				I mean i suppose, pending on exactly how you do it.. I never use my name on phones, i ALWAYS go prepaid, and use a bogus name. So thats that.. As for the addy, just use one your very familiar with. The one i use for example is that of a large apartment building i used to live in, and i just tell the moneygram cunts that its a private house.&nbsp;

				/\ IDK what hes referring to there, but i should probably mention that anytime you have to pay a clerk or cashier, you will be asked for ID.<br /><br />This is why i advise you do as I do, and find the nearest place to you that has moneygram kiosks.. its an automated moneygram machine. there is a camera in the machine to record you, but i hardly think that should be a concern, i used to cover up all my tattoos and wear a hood or hat, but lately i dont see it as necessary.

				In addition, maybe you should consider ordering a fugazi ID from the Road, once i can spare the 2 bills or what ever it is, ill be getting one.. always good to have.. <br /><br />Ive been thinking about getting a bs ID , and BS SS card or something else that will suffice to open a PO box.

				I was one of the many who used BitFloor to move my money. Bitinstant never worked because it was always in the 2-5k range and add the fees on top of all the drops/accounts we had to create....fuck that. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried to used BlueSky, but unless you get your request way in advance you will be bumped to the next week......aint nobody got time for that. <br /><br />I rolled the dice today and used localbitcoins and it was the smoothest of all the transactions I have done. Money was deposited at Bank of America and by the time I walked to the car I already got a notification of my phone that all the coins were in my wallet......and it was a 5k deposit. <br /><br />I officially have to endorse localbitcoins just for ease of use and no questions asked...the total fees and markup were far less that bitinstant or even bitfloor!

				it&#039;s on the clearnet, but the site is <br /><br />**CLEARNET WARNING**<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />check it out. When I use their service I usually move it between multiple wallets before even checking the blockchain info gives me a headache. I know a few people who have done the exchange person to person and all you do is scan the QRF codes on your phone. Literally takes about a minute to be complete and is actually very convenient. I guess it all depends on your comfort level. Most traders will accept Bank deposits and use the escrow system.

				BST is probably your best bet.&nbsp; I love them, they&#039;re very easy to work with, and super fast.&nbsp; I can also recommend indianpilldaddy, he&#039;s pretty much been my main source for coins since i stopped working with BST..&nbsp; i switched over because IPD is less busy, very friendly, trades at a great price and does it fast.&nbsp; but, he does have a $300 minimum, i believe.&nbsp; he takes western union or moneygram, which is really convenient for me for a number of different reasons.. but yeah, BST will take very good care of you.&nbsp; just make sure you put your order in early!!!

				I just used JumboMonkeyBiscuit for the first time ever doing one of these transactions and he was fast and came through. I put 200 on a card late saturday night and had a response from him after i went to bed and my money was in the account early sunday morning as promised. It had me nervous at first but after tons of research i felt confident in him and was pleased as could be with his communication and honest promt service.
