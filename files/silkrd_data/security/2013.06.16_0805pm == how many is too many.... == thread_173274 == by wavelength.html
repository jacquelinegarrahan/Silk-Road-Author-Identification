				Hmm, <br /><br />&nbsp;I would imagine that the more you order and recieve sucessfully, the less chances you have of a CD.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I see that you&#039;re getting mail frequently, I am less likely to think it&#039;s something out of the blue.

				how much is too much depends on&nbsp; the country. If you order just domestic you should be ok, no matter how much you order.

				IMO, every one is one too many. Its the risk we assume by doing this. Every order is a roll of the dice. Not that we are going to ever stop, but never get comfortable or complacent.

				Wavelength,<br /><br />So encouraged that you brought up this question. I was sitting on the outlook deck with the General and his wife having tea one afternoon and we were discussing this very condition.<br /><br />I had been living in a rock and roll world for two or three weeks burning through the ATM and my corner druggist and Bit Instantaneous connections were feeling weather-weary.<br /><br />Something felt strange one night. The ATM at first pretended to dispense my $300 dollars but paused. A repeat transaction yielded little except an error screen. I felt a hesitation thinking &quot;Maybe this is the time to stop for now.&quot;<br /><br />The previous week had been frought with an overwhelming feeling of suspicion that I was being watched but allowed to proceed so that someone could build a case against me using me as the tool.<br /><br />I determined that night, over one month ago, to be my last night of ordering from the Silkened Road. When I went to pay the druggist at the counter, she slobered in incomprehensible Spanish-laden English that the screen told her to tell me to contact Moneygram. I asked her for matches but she complained they were not sold there.<br /><br />I learned that night that payment slips, though instantly created on screen, do not mean anything until one receives an email reminder to go pay the druggist for BitInstantaneous. I also learned that night that sometimes ATMs do have random accidents on the same night one is denied a payment processing.<br /><br />Still, I waited a few days and placed my last four orders.<br /><br />After receiving the final one I breathed a sigh of relief and proceeded to hide my passport and drugs from myself and and potential snooping lawmen, though I myself am a ranking member of the Majestic Army.<br /><br />I have not queried a return to the Road since. I wanted to cool down. I was reading a newspiece in the press about three lawmen implicated in steroidology. Two of them had given information to their steroid dealer in order to help him avoid other police that happened to be investigating him. <br /><br />But the steroidsman knew enough to inquire whether he was being followed. Whatever tipped him off, be it strange behavior or a car in the rearview, his intuition was correct.<br /><br />The police that checked NCIC confirmed he was under investigation and even ran the license plate of the car that the steroid salesmen believed was following him. It turned out to be the private ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð° of a lawmen.&nbsp; Also the steroid salesman located a GPS tracker on his car and then decided, according to the printed media, that he better lay low for a few weeks.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not enough. He was under investigation by the FBI as were the three police that helped him. One police committed suicide rather than face the idiocy of a world that tells you what you can and cannot do to your own body, allowing some to pierce themselves as cattle or make markings upon themselves as bonded men.<br /><br />Be careful, please! If you think you need to take a month or two off from the road, or switch identities in order that ye may remain free, do so! No price is too high, no fee is too great, no amount of time too long to keep thy freedom! That you may be unseperated from the freemen, not caught in bondage like the world, pay the price!<br /><br />Moroni teaches us that we are to be a light even unto ourselves, that salt and pepper do not rot but save! Be a shining city on a hill. Practice akido! Talk with a fake Cajun accent and practice law in New Orleans. Star in direct-to-video action movies about the importance of clean logging!<br /><br />My stats as follows though I&#039;m not sure which account you wanted them for:<br /><br />Total transactions: 56<br />Total spent: $23001.19<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 8 months

				I think the question is more, what percentage of the packages you receive are SR packages? Its better, if you are receiving many SR packs IMO, to also receive lots of packages in general. I would say a 5:1 legit to SR pack ratio is pretty safe.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re ordering a lot off SR, order a lot from Amazon too
