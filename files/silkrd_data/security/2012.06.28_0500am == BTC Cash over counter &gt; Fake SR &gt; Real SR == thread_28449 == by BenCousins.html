				so i already use a fairly anonymous way of transfering IRL dollars into BTC and i normally just go Cash over counter &gt; SR account.<br />Just wondering if silk road tumbles when it comes in/when it goes out or when it transfers through SR.<br />And is there any way of my BTC&nbsp; addresse i give them (i generate a new addresse for each transaction) be linked to SR? Its only a jumble of letters and numbers so i dont see how but i do not understand how the block chain/public transaction history works really<br />Thanks

Of course you can always have a separate SR account to send to first before sending to your main one. Alternatively you can use your SR account to withdraw your coins to your own wallet address which will make it very difficult to trace your transactions.<br /><br />Remember as I said the only way to obtain Bitcoins safely is to buy them with cash or goods e.g MoneyPaks.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				I was wondering the same thing actually. How safe is it to transfer directly into the wallet? I know when sending the BTC go through a bunch of different wallets before getting to the destination wallet but is it not the same for transferring into the wallet?

The best way to illustrate this is to go to www.blockchain.info which is an online representation of the block chain and type your SR wallet address into the bar at the top right. You&#039;ll see the balance of your address as well as the amount of coins you&#039;ve received at that address and the address where those coins came from. <br /><br />You can take the addresses from which you&#039;ve received coins and do the same thing to trace back the coins to the very first wallet address where your coins were received - this is true whether you send your coins straight to SR after buying them or send them via a dozen different wallets, so in a sense you&#039;re right in saying it isn&#039;t much safer.<br /><br />If you insist on using a traceable method to buy your Bitcoins, I would recommend using a mixing service (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mixing_service) - these are designed specifically to prevent the kind of analysis I&#039;ve outlined above and will increase your safety.<br /><br />Silk Road itself has a built in coin mixer for withdrawals but not deposit i.e your coins are not &quot;mixed&quot; when they arrive in your wallet but will be when they leave it. Of course there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t have a separate SR account to receive payments then withdraw them to your real one if you want but if you want to be ultra safe I&#039;d recommend using the mixing service Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) - for a small commission (1-3%) your coins can be mixed and withdrawn in random amounts over a longer period of time which is better than SR&#039;s mixer which tumbles your Bitcoins on the spot. No reason you can&#039;t use both of course!<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a plug if you buy your coins using cash from a Bitcoin trader like me then you can save yourself all this worry and bother!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Firstly as I explained, SR has it&#039;s own coin mixer (by all means visit blockchain.info as I outlined above and test this for yourself as I did,&nbsp; it&#039;s a great way better to understand how Bitcoin works). As far as I know buyer&#039;s coins are also &quot;mixed&quot; each time they place an order (perhaps one of our more gifted members can confirm?)<br /><br />Of course this works both ways too - owning &quot;tainted&quot; coins would probably not prove that you necessarily received them in payment for something. A notable example is listed on the Bitcoin Wiki (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=73385.0) whereby a user had received a number of BTC in payments, some of which had apparently been stolen in the great Bitcoinica Heist. He argued successfully that this in itself didn&#039;t prove anything as anyone using a mixing service could well have received said &quot;tainted&quot; coins - it didn&#039;t reflect on him or his customers. Of course this user was a Bitcoin trader and broker (like me!) so didn&#039;t have any reason to conceal the fact he was using Bitcoins as he could readily demonstrate his activities were legal.<br /><br />Secondly vendors are quite canny at ways of &quot;cashing out&quot; their Bitcoins without leaving a paper trail. I doubt many of them simply wire the funds to an exchange and then to their own bank account as even if it isn&#039;t possible to prove they&#039;ve received the specific coins, large sums showing up in their accounts will merit further investigation.<br /><br />They can of course skip the bank account issue altogether and use a BTC trader to send them cash in the mail in exchange for their coins (I offer this service myself) or receive precious metals like gold bullion in the mail in exchange for BTC via Coinabul. <br /><br />There are also other methods to salt away your funds such that even if LEO had made the original purchase it would make it extremely difficult to detect through proxy bank accounts, forming offshore companies etc. I&#039;d rather not go into details as it&#039;s an area of finance I only have a small experience with and also you never know who&#039;s reading!<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
