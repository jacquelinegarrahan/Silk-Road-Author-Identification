				Hello, I am using tails and wondering how to highlight someones public key from they&#039;re profile page, it seems I can either click and highlight a sentance or click edit select all which highlights and copies the whole page? Is there a way I can just highlight and copy the key only?

				you are on a laptop, aren&#039;t you? it&#039;s a problem with your touchpad.. i have the same issues.<br /><br />the only way i can think of getting around it is using a mouse, which not very convenient for a laptop. instead, i use my desktop when making purchases and the laptop for when im browsing the forums.

				Use the cursor to highlight the first dash in the &quot;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK&quot;. Now hold down the Shift key and click on the very last dash in &quot;END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot; Voila! The whole thing is highlighted<br /><br />You can also do it by holding Shift and pressing &quot;End&quot; to highlight an entire line, then (while still holding Shift) tap the Down arrow on your keyboard (each tap adds another line to the highlighted part) until you&#039;ve got the whole message highlighted.

I&#039;m not too sure how to configure persistent volume as you suggested? Also unsure of how to get my own public key, I click export and export it to my desktop but I can&#039;t open the file it just says &quot;A key imported for............ &quot; is there a way to open the file with text editor?<br /><br />I managed to work out PGP on GPGtools on my mac but I am keen to stick with tails as it leaves no traces just dont have any experience with linux

				Ignore the how to open file with text edit part I have no figured that out, if you could explain the persistent volume part though would be great, as soon as I figure that out will be up and away in the PGP world!&nbsp; :)

				Click Applications/Tails/Configure persistent volume.<br /><br />When setting up you can specify what will be saved and what wont.<br /><br />Follow the onscreen instructions and click GnuPG when you have the option. From now on when you import a pgp key they will be saved... you can access them from System/Preferences/Passwords and Encryption Keys<br /><br />PS. sorry for the late reply!
