				How does one safely comment on reddit through tor?<br /><br />I noticed that the &quot;captcha&quot; text doesn&#039;t show up in my tor browser when I try to register, I am not going to turn scripts on or allow them, can I get around this?

				Unfortunately, it looks like if you want to see the captcha or use a lot of the site functionality (like the &quot;collapse comment thread&quot; button), you have to whitelist reddit.com and something like reddit.s3.amazonservices.com. Forgot the second domain, but it&#039;s something like that. Reddit is hosted on Amazon.<br />

				I just noticed that they (rather annoyingly) removed the ability to whitelist individual domains in the NoScript that ships with the latest browser bundle. You only have the option to temporarily allow everything on the page. This must be part of their aggressive campaign against linkability, to the detriment of more important features like untraceability. They would ship Tor Browser with NoScript enabled if they cared more about that.

				Using the URL https://pay.reddit.com lets you log in to reddit, but you still can&#039;t make comments unless you enable scripts. Very annoying, and like astor said you can no longer whitelist individual domains. I have no idea why they would remove that feature.

Their logic is that people with a unique combination of whitelisted domains can be fingerprinted and tracked across web sites. I don&#039;t care that much if someone knows that anonymous Tor user X (me) visited site A, then later visited site B, as long as they don&#039;t learn my identity.<br />
