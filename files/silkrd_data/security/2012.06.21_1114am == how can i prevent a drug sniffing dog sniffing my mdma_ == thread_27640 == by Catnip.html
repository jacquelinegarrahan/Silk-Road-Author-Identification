				What I want to know is how smelly is MDMA to k9Â´s? I would imagine its not so smelly drug. For example I find coke has a lot stronger smell. MDMA hardly smells at all to my nose.

				in another thread someone pointed towards a site with a cop that turned his back on the law and started telling people how to hide drugs from police and their dogs. one main point i remember him saying was dogs are generally trained to sniff out 1 particular drug, so for example a dog trained to sniff out cannabis would not be able to find cocaine.<br /><br />i doubt that helps you at all unless you&#039;ve got the balls to actually ask the cop &#039;so what drugs can your dog detect?&#039; but i doubt they&#039;d train many dogs to detect MDMA, i&#039;d have thought they would want most of them on the lookout for &#039;harder&#039; drugs.<br /><br />if you don&#039;t have the balls to ask the copper just kick the dog in the face 8)

Say, for example, if you&#039;re going to a festival where you know there will be dogs, then they will probably be trained to sniff out a drug like MDMA, LSD, Cannabis or other &#039;party/festival&#039; drugs. Whereas if you&#039;re going though an airport, they will be probably be trained to sniff out the hard drugs, such as heroin, crack etc.. <br />I also read somewhere that if you coat the baggie containing the drug in a shit load of vaseline, the dog won&#039;t be able to smell it. But thats sounds unlikely to me, but I&#039;ve never tried it&nbsp; ::)

				it was a good read, i&#039;ll see if i can find it. explains how dogs smell as we see - it can differentiate all the different ingredients in soup and stuff like that, and just say humans have 2000 smell sensors in their nose, dogs have close to a 200 million, and a small proportion of these sensors are (i think, but can&#039;t remember exactly because i was pretty stoned reading it) infrared, so they have something like x-ray smelling abilities.<br /><br />this is it&nbsp; http://www.cannabisculture.com/node/8634<br /><br />i was right - infrared smell! crazy shit!

				dunno - that is a good question. i&#039;d say probably if it&#039;s dissolved, but not if its vacuum &amp; water sealed at the bottom of some liquid. i have absolutely no basis on these guesses, only that it makes sense to me
