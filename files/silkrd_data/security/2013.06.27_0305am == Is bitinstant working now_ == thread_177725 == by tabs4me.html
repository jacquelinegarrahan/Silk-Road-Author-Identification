				It does work, I&#039;ve used the new site a couple of times and haven&#039;t encountered any problems receiving bitcoins. The problem is that you need to sign up with real info in order to use the new site. This leaves you with two options: a) use your real identity to sign up and obtain the bitcoins, and wash them before sending them to your SR account. I haven&#039;t tried this, I went with option b) using someone else&#039;s identity to sign up and obtain the bitcoins. To do this, you need to be able to answer 3 questions about whoever you are pretending to be in order to &quot;verify&quot; your identity. It took me 2 tries (not sure if I was unsuccessful the first time or there was an error), 2+ hours of my time, and a couple of background checks (anonymously of course) to pull it off.<br /><br />To sum up everything, yes it does work; however, it may not be worth the effort (given all the fees that bitinstant applies). I&#039;m sure there are better ways to get bitcoins now, but I already went through all the effort to do bitinstant. Maybe others can suggest better alternatives (for USA please).

				Head over to Bitcoin talk forums and see if you can find some sellers I guess or local bitcoins. This current set up sucks ass though. There needs to be a better way. Would be nice if there was a way to buy directly from miners but the problem is and always will be is the cash.

				I used bitinstaat today and sent a couple of coins via the Bitcoin to Email route at Walmart. Only reason I did that is I set up some new encrpyted wallets and they are still updating for the first time. 215 weeks of transactions takes a while. Anyway by the time I got home the transaction was completed. Jumped on to tormail to make sure I got the transaction email and nothing is there. I wait a couple of hours and still nothing. So I email support, no answer. An hour later email again, get a reply that everything looks fine on their backend and that the email was sent. Great, except I never got it. Verified that the email I sent it to was correct just in case and it was. The last part of their email was something crappy about if I want fast support I should only do transactions during their business hours of 10 am to 7pm EDT which is NOT listed anywhere on their site. Seemed like a dick response to a legitimate concern. So anywhere here I am with an email saying my transaction is complete (sender email) and no way to get the coins because I never got the email on the receiving end that gives instructions to use a pin you set to get the coins. Waiting til 10 am EDT to try again since apparently they aren&#039;t the 24/7 service they pretend to be.

As long as you use the same email address as you gave for your fake name originally it will work. Literally there is no verification process other than verifying your email address is the same as the one you used originally with that fake name. I use a fake name. One that I made up. It still works with 0 problems. Everyone needs to stop spreading misinformation about bitinstant. It works as long as you do the right things.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, that worked with the old site hence the &#039;redesign&#039; of the site which added additional security measures. I don&#039;t see how it&#039;s misinformation when it&#039;s not only one person reporting this. So you think that&#039;s all they do is to make sure you use the same email addresses. Really? And you think people need to stop spreading misinformation? You need to go use the site and start putting fake shit in there and see how far you get.

				I didn&#039;t start this so called spread of misinformation on Bitinstant. Threads if you notice you were not started by me. I merely took a look at and responded with out I found out. I was able to search and find peoples personal info such as Name, SSN, Bank account #, DOB, CC, Address over the internet to be used for testing. <br /><br />Using there info I set up a buy transaction with one of these peoples info purposely making a spelling mistake on the last name in which I received an error message. Fixed the spelling worked fine. Now I did that for 5 other people that I had info but this time changing different variables such as incorrect DOB or addresses, etc. I spent the good part of this morning messing around with it and testing out different things cause I was curious.<br /><br />It worked for you? I&#039;m really happy for you, bursting with joy in fact.

Once they finally sent it, and for some reason I got 4 copies of the email when it finally went through, I collected them no problem. They seem to have an issue somewhere that is causing this problem. It&#039;s obvious someone tried to send the email 4 different times and they all just came through at once at the end of the day. I won&#039;t be doing bitcoin to email ever again. In fairness I did get my coins so all is well. It was a MAJOR hassle though. I think I will try someone else. I wish it was easier to get currency on BTC-e because I have no issues trading on that market or moving bitcoin in and out of my account. They are always about 5-10 bucks cheaper a coin than Gox as well.
