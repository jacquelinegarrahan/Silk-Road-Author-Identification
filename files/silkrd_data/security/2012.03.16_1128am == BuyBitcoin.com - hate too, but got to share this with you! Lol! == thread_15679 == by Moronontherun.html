				3/15/2012: just completed this bitcoin sale yesterday afternoon; completed by 4:15 P.M. Bruce Wagner (&lt;&lt;&lt; really nice guy!) BuyBitcoin.com - 21.2979 BTCs! Deposited Wells Fargo $120.00 USDs. Took 3 hours 20 minutes. $5.63/Bitcoin. Not bad. I think BTCs were @ $5.34 when he traded.&nbsp; <br /><br />My God! How can he stay in business! People, I don&#039;t know about you, but this dude rocks! He&#039;s nice, polite, professional and fast. The rate I chose (he has 3 24somthing% for with in 5 minutes, 9.99% for 12 hours and 4.99% for 24 hours. I think he was making a point by giving me this ridiculous deal so I told him I would tell you all here that he IS legit. He doesn&#039;t want to know what you&#039;re doing with them and as far as I know, has never been here - SR. <br /><br />I&#039;m telling you, give this guy a try and see what he will do for you. He doesn&#039;t seem to have any different %s no matter how many you get. I mean he only made $5.63 on my total order. Hardly worth the time! But I&#039;m telling you, I&#039;m looking at my 21.2979 bitcoins as we speak!<br /><br />He can make your dreams come a little easier on the pocket book! I&#039;d like to keep him for myself (selfish prick!:) but I love all you shits here and have to share him with you all! No, he&#039;s not my family, but he&#039;s earned being my brother! I never met him before a few days ago when I was trying once again a way to buy bitcoins that didn&#039;t make you pull your freegin hair out.&nbsp; <br /><br />He is available by business phone number and private cell number, I&#039;ll let him give that to you. Just tell him &#039;Oz&#039; sent you!<br /><br />You go Bruce! Love ya bra! Mahalo!<br /><br />Oz

				Alright.&nbsp; Just got off the phone with BuyBitcoin and I&#039;m gonna give them a shot.&nbsp; I hate changing how I&#039;ve always got my coins (through get-bitcoin.com) but they no longer use bank of america so it&#039;s not possible for me to use them anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m just hoping everything goes smooth with these guys and I don&#039;t get fucked over with my money.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know you Moronontherun but I&#039;m taking your word for it.&nbsp; Jesus, I hope I don&#039;t get fucked on this.&nbsp;

				Not to put anybody off using Bruce Wagner, but I feel people should do their due diligence before trading with him - http://www.metafilter.com/107065/Bruce-Wagner-and-the-Bitcoin-Scam<br /><br />The name struck a chord in my head (in a bad way) so I Googled again and re-read about Bruce&#039;s past.<br />Personally I&#039;d recommend doing a number of small transactions, and never anything over $1000 with Wagner; that being said, I&#039;ve never traded with him, and can only go on what I&#039;ve read and researched.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Well I just gave Mr.Wagner&#039;s company buybitcoin.com a shot and got scammed. The sad part is it isn&#039;t even a lot of money. He got like ~$40 from me. I am sure he has done good to others before and now, I have a feeling he is a selective scammer. As I have read amazing reviews here and elsewhere for his service. I used bitinstant and had no issues getting the bitcoins into my wallet. I have emailed him, called him, texted him, and no response since he received my funds. He had a 5min response time before my money was in his hand then *poof* he disappeared.

				I tried this yesterday and got my bitcoins within 24 hours. I payed around 30 dollars and only got back 2.5 bitcoins -_______-. He didn&#039;t scam me but he certainly hustled me.
