				Hi guys, im reasonably new to SR and have only really come across localbitcoins.com as a means to purchase bitcoins, however it is linked to my phone number and email!!!!!!!!!! And im paying $133 AUD per bitcion. I did check out some of the other ones like mtgox etc, but they wanted scanned copies of my licence and birth certificate!!!! WTF?? Is there any others here from Aus that can help me with both prices and anonymity?&nbsp;

				I like using Spendbitcoins.com, they are a bit more expensive but are great for remaining anonymous.<br /><br />

				Check out Bit Innovate or Omni coins. You just have to make a cash deposit into their account at a bank.

Any other places you can recommend considering that Bit Innovate is offline ATM?? 5.9% sounds alot better than paying the 10% that Spend Bitcoins is asking. I just kinda kept using them since I first started out on the road and I guess got kinda complacent but now I want to start switching it up a bit and also getting just slightly educated for now in encryption and how to optimize my anonymity all together. Getting my head around all the jargon and trying to understand alot of this stuff is kinda confusing. But yeah thanks for helping me out guys!!<br /><br />+1 to the both of you!!

				I&#039;ve used bitinnovate once (my first time) and spendbitcoins once. They are both the same in terms of anonymity but I get the impression with BitInnovate&#039;s recemt temp closure that they might be looking at ways to become more legitimised, i.e requiring ID and that sort of thing. Just a feeling I get... I hope not though as they are cheaper than spendbitcoins.

I&#039;ll keep an eye out on that. Yeah bitcoins are definitely coming under more scrutiny here without a doubt. Spendbitcons used to have an account with the Commonwealth Bank that customers could also deposit in to but it was apparently closed by the Commonwealth Bank itself for reasons I can only speculate on. That speculation being that it would have something to do with the bank distancing itself from what it believes to be questionable / illegal activity. I mean come on, when you&#039;ve go an account under the name Cryptospend don&#039;t you think that may set a few bells off??<br /><br />Thanks for the advice mate!! I&#039;m looking to exercise as&nbsp; many options as I can for several reasons. Can you also cash out through any of these other services?
