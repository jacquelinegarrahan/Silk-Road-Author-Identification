				So I&#039;ve been lurking around, spent all night researching silk road and on top of that Tor and how to effectively use it and silk road together.<br />What i want to know is how you all get around this whole American PO box technique as i personally only have a co-operative with a post office in it and then a main collecting post office with no personal box&#039;s to pick up delivered items without having to make personal contact with someone who works there.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not sure how to get around the whole signing for the delivery of an item, would it even need a signature if it was only a small package?<br />And one last thing, is it worth tumbling my BTC&#039;s around in order to launder them a bit so they are less traceable i think it probably is but i&#039;m not having much luck with finding decent sites in which to do this effectively.<br /><br />Anyway i&#039;m new here and i want to get to grips properly with the whole scheme.<br />Any help is appreciated. <br /><br />Cheers

				I have never had something come which I was required to sign for. ( Although I don&#039;t get this paranoia about signing for something, who wouldn&#039;t sign for something addressed to them? )<br />I personally don&#039;t use P.O. boxes and just regularly shift addresses that I use , sometimes my own. <br />No problems so far. And in the UK we could always deny we know what it was and that would be it, maybe a some questioning if a package was ever caught. But I seriously doubt it with the packaging of most vendors.<br /><br />Although SR has its own tumbler it would be wise of you to pass it around through a few wallets, (flexcoin , blockchain etc )<br />

				Yeah i thought that if it was only a small amount of anything they would just post it through the letter box. What i&#039;m also wondering is are you using your normal computer be it a pc or mac or have you got a shitty laptop running Liberte from a USB flash drive? Currently i&#039;m just going to buy a couple of random books and a fake copy of PS CS6 so i can&#039;t imagine i&#039;d need that much encryption to do things like that but as soon as i want to purchase other things such as narcotics i shall go through the whole Liberte and flash drive system.<br /><br />Could you elaborate a tiny bit of other sits in which to throw around a few wallets, and also do you have any knowledge on three hop proxies? And where or how to get them installed, or would it even be necessary if you were running Liberte with a flash drive?<br /><br />And is the forum always full of spamming BTC bots?
