				Looked at a few of the suggestions out there and I still reckon BTCXUK is the best bet. They take UK bank transfers and deposits and send coins within 2hrs of confirmed funds on your account I guess. Cant ask better than that. Cash to BTC pretty fast if you need.<br />Anyone know other ways?

				Yep, I can confirm this is a very good way to get BTC in the UK. Have done 2 transactions with him where I sent him money late at night and the BTC has been in my account by the time I&#039;ve woken up the following day. Coms and rates have been very good as well.<br />Number one choice for sure.

				Are people using online banking to transfer?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d prefer to use cash over the counter for anonymity but tried today and none of the banks I tried (HSBC, TSB, Nationwide) could do it because of the reference.

				Decent price.<br /><br />What about these. Has anybody tried any of these?:<br /><br />btcfaucet: (has more feedback on bitcoin-otc)<br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/btcfaucet/<br />More info: https://localbitcoins.com/ad/1338/buy-bitcoins-with-cash-rockingham-rd-leicestershire-le16-uk-market-harborough-united-kingdom<br />Pricing Details: http://btc4cash.com/price.txt<br /><br />BtcDiscreet:<br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/BtcDiscreet/<br />More info: https://localbitcoins.com/ad/1449/buy-bitcoins-with-cash-manchester-leeds-liverpool-newcastle-sheffield-united-kingdom<br /><br />MaxSan:<br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/MaxSan/<br /><br /><br />All seem pretty reliable to me. Looks like btcfaucet have much quicker turnaround for bank transfers - apparently 5 minutes.

				These sites are exactly what I need thanks for sharing them.<br /><br />How do you feel about losing anonymity?&nbsp; Do you tumble the coins after receiving them?<br /><br />Do you think with this method it would be stupid to not wash them, I currently dont&nbsp; :-[ but use a less traceable system.<br /><br />Pretty interesting little economy developing there.... love SR!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t tried anything do to with all of this yet. Never purchased bitcoins. Never bought anything on SR. But I will be doing soon, and I&#039;ve posted my plan which a couple of people so far have said should be safe/anonymous enough, which involves sending the bitcoins through 2 mixing services:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=79016.0
