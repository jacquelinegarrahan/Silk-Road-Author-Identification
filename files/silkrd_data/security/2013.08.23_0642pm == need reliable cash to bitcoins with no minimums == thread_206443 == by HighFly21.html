				honestly dont trust any bitcoin vendors, not to be mean but there are vendors on SR who have like 6 accounts and make them all look good and trust worthy and when they have enough trust they cash out all at once, look at vicecitybank, hes no longer a vender under that account, but definitly has alot more accounts just waiting to fuck you over<br /><br />if i were you, id use bitcoin-brokers.org<br />go to the help desk tab make make an order they give you a qoute you go to the bank that you selected from their options, and deposit cash into the account of the seller then you take a picture of your reciept and post it under your qoute, and its all done, no I.D. nothing its really easy and fast, i have my btc in like 30 minutes

				coinbase works great but your going to have to link your bank account to it to get your coins.. so your identity will be revealed there but you can instantly transfer your coins from there to another anonymous wallet like blockchain.info once youve sent your coins to that wallet change the bitcoin address on your blockchain wallet then delete that address off of your blockchain account. then simply transfer the coins from blockchain to silkroad. rinse and repeat with the addresses once youve got your coins on SR. Just dont forget to use your regular browser on coinbase then use tor for blockchain.

				Is that really all there is to bitcoin-brokers.org? Does it cost anything extra or is there a limit to how many bitcoins you can buy at once?
