				Yeah, hi there.&nbsp; So, twice now I&#039;ve been in the process of setting up an order for about half a grand, and had to stop and give up on the idea because of a weak PGP key.&nbsp; I&#039;m no longer comfortable encrypting an address I&#039;m going to be at to receive a package if the PGP key is less than 2048 bits long.&nbsp; Weird stuff&#039;s been going on lately, we all know that, and I&#039;d rather be free and with shitty drugs than in prison with no drugs, know what I mean.&nbsp; Yep, I&#039;m paranoid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also done drugs for over a decade and have never been arrested.&nbsp; I happen to think that&#039;s not coincidence.<br /><br />Sooooo... you like dolla-dolla bills and all?&nbsp; Yeah, me too.&nbsp; Difference is, I like drugs more and give lots of money to people for their drugs.&nbsp; So, how many bits does YOUR key have?&nbsp; Think you may have lost a few $500+ orders because your key&#039;s too weak?&nbsp; Honestly, I&#039;m not trying to help you.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to help me.&nbsp; Use stronger keys so I can give you my money, damn it!&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)<br /><br />&quot;Well then say something to the vendor!&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, I&#039;ve done that before.&nbsp; No go.&nbsp; Too much hassle to change it once established, I guess.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not joking, two guys lost $500 of my dollars today.&nbsp; I may be the only one, but at one lost order a week like that, it&#039;s over $20k/year.&nbsp; That&#039;s some poor fucker&#039;s whole income.<br /><br />Oh, and for the love of God, use your Silk Road account name in the name or comments or email or fucking something so I don&#039;t have to look up and verify every fucking time I order that I&#039;m using the right key... we end up with fucking dozens of these things, and if I have to remember to identify your key under a name different than the Silk Road name I&#039;m ordering from... that&#039;s just one more little reason to pay somebody else, ya know.

				There&#039;s always a comment line about the version &amp; program used to generate the key.&nbsp; This is actually more than just advertising: if a version is found to have a problem with one of it&#039;s algorithms, that has to be known so a later version can say &quot;this key was generated with a known flawed version and may be unsafe,&quot; or something.<br /><br />This key has no comment.<br /><br />Both the primary and subkeys can be used for encryption.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen that.&nbsp; GPG is fine with it, but...

				Well, you can hve... I think actually unlimited subkeys?&nbsp; not really sure.&nbsp; At least several.&nbsp; Can even attach a fucking photo to your key if you really want :P&nbsp; gpg is a pretty spiffy program.<br /><br />Usually you have one primary key, and one subkey key -- not all keys can be used for both encryption and signing (to verify you&#039;re the one who wrote something).&nbsp; So usually you have one for signing, and one for encryption.&nbsp; Usually.&nbsp; Like I said, gpg is fine with this key, it gave no errors or anything... but it&#039;s quirky is all :)<br /><br /><br />DSA keys cannot encrypt.&nbsp; They can only sign.&nbsp; I think RSA can do either... but don&#039;t quote me on it.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not sure if they can do both at hte same time, or if you have to pick which one you want a certain key to be for.&nbsp; These are all heavy math details, and I&#039;ll be honest and say I&#039;ve studied this stuff because I&#039;m a fucking geek to the Nth degree... but I only read it for pleasure, not worried about actually proving the algorithms or some shit.<br /><br />In short, I can&#039;t remember the details, heh.

It&#039;s not a necessary part of the PGP spec. However, if you use an obscure PGP program, putting that in the comment can greatly reduce your anonymity set.

				Hmm... true, true.&nbsp; I suppose it depends on whether your primary concern is anonymity, or secrecy.
