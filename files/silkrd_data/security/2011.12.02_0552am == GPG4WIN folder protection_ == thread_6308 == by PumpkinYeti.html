				Well I -think- I have GPG figured out for the most part...<br /><br />But now my issue is that when you open GPA, it&#039;s plain as day what my username is on the site (the owned key there with the yellow wrench). I have my OS account name password protected, but I&#039;d like a second line of defense in case I forget to log out. And my OS doesn&#039;t make it easy to add password protection to the folder.<br /><br />What&#039;s the best and/or easiest way to protect that file from being opened by people who I don&#039;t want to open it?<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking either a third party program for simple password protection, but I&#039;m concerned if the file can still be view if someone used a different OS to look at the files on this drive (I&#039;ve heard Windows password protected files can still be seen if booting Linux on it, is that true?)<br /><br />What do you guys do to protect the file from being opened by someone else?

				I would recommend having a GPG stuff in a truecrypt file, with in a hidden truecrypt file.....at a minimum.&nbsp; Better would be to throw that and other incriminating things like tor bundle, bitcoin, keepass all in there and put in on a thumb drive.

				For those of you still deciding, I took caffeine_me&#039;s advice.<br /><br />I now have&nbsp; a thumbdrive encrypted with TrueCrypt that I keep all the sensitive stuff on. Tor, PGP, Keepass, and other unmentionables.<br /><br />However, I think I&#039;ll remove Keepass OFF of it to keep my TrueCrypt password on it. That way Keepass master password kinda controls EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I think its a good system.

				Not a bad idea of keeping your truecrypt password in keepass, as long as you trust their encryption (Truecyrpt is only as good as your password) and you don&#039;t have your other log ins that directly link you to incriminating websites they can then use to log in to your shit and have all evidence.&nbsp; I just keep my truecrypt password in my head only, and practice it daily&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; And I don&#039;t forget the non-hidden password encase I ever have to use it. :-[

				I have a sorta related question that I don&#039;t think deserves it&#039;s own thread.&nbsp; I started using SR and Tor and PGP and all that about a month ago without really understanding alot about it, or whether I would actually be interested in following through with joining the community and become a regular user.&nbsp; Now that I have, I&#039;d really like to move all of this stuff onto a thumb drive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got TrueCrypt and understand how it works, and the Tor bundle is easy enough, but I&#039;m not sure how to deal with PGP.&nbsp; The install I&#039;m using has my key and all the keys of my vendors that I want to be able to keep, but it&#039;s sitting right here in plain view on my desktop, and with every order and each passing day, I want to remove it more and more.<br /><br />How do I go about importing all of this from my current install to a new one on a thumb drive.&nbsp; Can I install Kleopatra on a thumb drive that doesn&#039;t have an os/isn&#039;t bootable?&nbsp; Basically, I still want to use this computer for all my activity here, but only when I pop in the usb, and then have no traces on my home os when I remove it. I&#039;ll be picking up the thumb drive probably tomorrow, so I&#039;m trying to get a head start.&nbsp; I assume I install everything on the drive and then use truecrypt?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If someone could give me a quick rundown on the process I&#039;d really appreciate it.&nbsp; My biggest concern is keeping all my PGP stuff intact, so I don&#039;t have to create new keys and re-import all my vendors.<br />

				I&#039;d recommend that you use gpg4usb rather than gpg4win; fits on a thumbdrive/encrypted volume and doesn&#039;t need any kind of installation.<br />I myself had to find an alternative to gpg4win since Kleopatra wouldn&#039;t start at all.

				Ok, cool. But can I transfer my keys to gpg4usb from my current install? I suppose I should just try and figure it out when I get the usb, but I&#039;m trying to get an idea if I&#039;ll have to start over with my gpg.

				You should be able to just move those items from the desktop to the thumbdrive and use TrueCrypt.<br /><br />FYI, I deleted PGP4Win, then reinstalled it using the thumbdrive as a destination folder. When I opened it, everything was there. Not sure how.<br /><br />In any case you sound like me at the moment, trying to be as careful as possible and create as many hurdles as I can to shore up my defenses. I downloaded File Shredder to totally remove files deleted files on the hard drive, you should look into that if you haven&#039;t. Also installed PeerBlock and Keepass.

You are correct. Both are there. Thanks for pointing that out, I appreciate it. Their uninstall function must suck.<br /><br />What do you recommend now? Delete the folder and reinstall on thumbdrive again if necessary? I&#039;ve only got my key and a single vendor&#039;s so it&#039;s no trouble.<br /><br />Then I&#039;ll want to run File Shredder again... this paranoia thing is time consuming hehehheh I guess I&#039;ll have it all set up pretty well before I get too involved...
