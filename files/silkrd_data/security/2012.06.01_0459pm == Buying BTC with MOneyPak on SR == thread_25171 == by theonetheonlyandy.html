				less you know something I don&#039;t about the MP to BTC exchange, I&#039;d just advise others to use Privnote.com to hide any information, but honestly SR offers the same service through its delete after seeing type shit.<br /><br />To be safe don&#039;t post any &quot;sensitive&quot; info in the chat / message areas.

				yea i know having or buying coin is not a crime, but since there are some vendors on the SR that are making the exchange, and&nbsp; it just maybe me being very very very paranoid here, can be LE and is able to track you down? im guessing its a very long shot. and since they are already making the exchanges and they know its being used on SR see what i mean. but i was high when i thought this up so maybe thats it but cant never be to careful. i use different methods every single time to get my coin. so no biggie. i suggest some do that same. been&nbsp; a year buying coin only for the road and every time i use a different method to get the coin.

				Yeah, I&#039;ll have to agree with darthvaderstar on this one...MP may be the safest way to get the BTC&#039;s, although most of these &quot;anonymous&quot; methods involve some risk of getting your face on camera (convenience store to buy a MP or a bank to deposit cash).&nbsp; <br /><br />The fees to get BTC&#039;s via MP are competitive with other methods and the transfer to your SR wallet is quick.&nbsp; I used Coinbox for my first transaction and the coins were in my account within 30 seconds...BAM!&nbsp; <br /><br />Just use your brain and vary the MP purchases from time to time, and everything should be fine...well, as long as BTC&#039;s are still legal that is....<br /><br />Omega<br /><br />
