				Hi all, <br /><br />I apologize if this has been asked in the past, but I tried searching the forums and kept getting an error. Anyways, I have done some research on the most secure ways to buy bitcoins and want to stay safe, and recently read that Moneygram transfers (like Bitinstant - I have never had a problem) are not very secure. I have never done a single transaction more than $300 and I have only been ID&#039;d once, and I have always used my real information. <br /><br />I purchase the coins and have them directly transferred to my main wallet. After the transfer is successful (usually less than an hour), I transfer the coins to an anonymous wallet (new registration every time) on Tor. From that anonymous wallet, I then transfer to SR. I am also always behind a VPN. <br /><br />So, I am hoping this method is secure since the coins go through different channels prior to SR, but I am looking to buy larger quantities of product and will need to deposit larger amounts of money. In your opinion, what is the largest amount to send via Moneygram without seeming suspicious? I have considered multiple transactions in multiple locations, but Moneygram has my info and will know that I am making multiple transfers anyway, which may look worse. I have a fake ID (real state issued, just a different person) that I considered using, but I thought it could be more risky. <br /><br />I need to deposit about $1000 so I was thinking of spreading it out over a few days in smaller deposits, the only thing that sucks are the multiple fees. <br /><br />Does anyone have experience depositing large sums, or have suggestions for different bitcoin purchase methods? I am still fairly new at this so any advice is appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks! :)

				$1,000 is not a lot of money.&nbsp; Just do it over a few transactions using your present method.

				We do deals in the multiple thousands regularly via Western Union and Moneygram.&nbsp; If you send during business hours it takes a matter of hours to get your BTC transferred directly to your SR account.

I was under the impression that transactions over $1000 were restricted by Bitinstant (and daily limits of $2000), so I guess multiple transactions are necessary. As long as my current method is alright, it should be safe. I mean, buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal. <br /><br />And no, $1000 isn&#039;t a lot of money, but I wasn&#039;t sure if it would raise any red flags. Luckily for me, the products I buy on SR are reasonably priced and there is a huge demand where I live, so I&#039;m never spending a lot of money, but have huge profit margins... :)
