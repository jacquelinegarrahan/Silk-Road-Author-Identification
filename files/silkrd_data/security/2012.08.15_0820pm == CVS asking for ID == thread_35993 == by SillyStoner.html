				I am trying to do the cash bitinstant option but when I try to goto the CVS near me they ask for ID even though I am transferring under 100$.&nbsp; Does anyone have any idea for alternative ways to buy bitcoin anonomously?&nbsp; Would purchasing bitcoin online but then using bitcoin fog be sufficient enough for someone only ordering personal amounts and not selling?

				That&#039;s odd, I&#039;ve done two bitinstant cash deposits through CVS and they never asked for my ID, but maybe it depends on the CVS...try a different one maybe?

				Plenty of people have done that and been fine, so I think you will be too. I just went to CVS to do another bitinstant deposit and still wasn&#039;t ID&#039;d, so it must just be the one you went to. You can also go to Walmart and 7/11 to do the bitinstant deposit.

				I can guarantee you it was just the clerk working at the time, as I have used a CVS a handful of times, and one of those times it was a different clerk than normal and they asked for my ID. I have used walmart many times though and never been id&#039;d, so maybe try Walmart. <br /><br />Did you actually give them your ID? There&#039;s nothing illegal or wrong with pulling the ol&#039; &quot;oh crap I don&#039;t have my id on me, I&#039;ll come back&quot;, and then leaving. Sure they may know you are lying but who cares? They can&#039;t stop you from cancelling the transaction.

				I posted in a thread about this issue yesterday. I went to a CVS last night, and after getting off the phone with the Moneygram rep, I proceeded to the cashier to finish my order, and as she was about to ring me up, the bitch, yes, she was being a bitch, asked for my ID. I told her I forgot it, and walked out.&nbsp; However, last month, I went to another CVS, and was never asked to present ID. It&#039;s crazy that they need ID to pay a &quot;bill.&quot; I&#039;ll definitely check out some of the other deposit options, or I&#039;ll just go to another CVS.

				Thanks for the help guys!&nbsp; I have actual medical reasons that I NEED marijuana for (is this a possible legal defense?) so it&#039;s important I find some way to do this.&nbsp; I&#039;m about to try the last place by here that I can.&nbsp; Mt concern is that I have filled prescriptions there with my real ID at the pharmacy center in the back and will be having to do so because of medical problems.&nbsp; Should I avoid this CVS?&nbsp; It&#039;s the only place I can try yet.&nbsp; I called the banks and they all require ID.<br /><br />EDIT 8/16/2012 1:29pm EST:<br />I forgot to mention that&nbsp; I could still purchase it through an exchange online but my main concern with that is being traced.&nbsp; I was thinking that I could transfer it to a non-tor accessed clearnet address and and then transfer it to a tor net wallet address and then send it through bitcoin fog and then to SR and if anyone asked I should be able to claim that the tor account stole from my clearnet accounts bitcoins if any one asked as a deffense for the police.

				Mostly because I don&#039;t have a car and I keep calling of the other places close to me and they keep saying they only accept money order without an don&#039;t accept money gram with out an id.&nbsp; So I need away to obscucure where bitcoins come from no matter how I purchased it because I might not be able to purchase them anonomouly and to get them through an exhange that is traceble about to me.&nbsp; So basicaly I would need to make the bitcoins that I purchase so that I could say they were stolen such transfering them to a clear net adress originally and then transfering them to a torifide wllet and then sehding through bitcoinfog and them to silkroaed.&nbsp; Would this be good sincd I am having troulbe finding a place that will accept a moneygram without an ID

				What&#039;s wrong with showing your ID? The whole point of bitcoins is that they can&#039;t be traced back to you.<br /><br />Plus if they somehow could trace back to the shop where you bought the CVS or whatever then they&#039;d have your picture on cctv anyways.

				Do you have a question there ?<br /><br />Those are two statements.<br /><br />Have you looked at the thread I created walking step by step through the process (one way to do it anyway)?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0<br /><br />There is no point in manually moving your coins through wallets, that would be totally transparent.

				The question was if either of those would obscure my identity.&nbsp; All of the banks and CVSs by me require an ID for this I&#039;ve tried them and every where else except walmart wants money orders not money grams and walmart is WAY to far away (I don&#039;t have a car).&nbsp; &nbsp;So I was asking if I would be safe just identity wise doing either of those two things or just buying online through a exchange then sending through bigcoinfog.

				Also is there anyway I can do it through money order?&nbsp; I know the giant eagle by me doesn&#039;t ID for money orders but bitinstant.com seems to only take moneygram?&nbsp; If I could use money orders instead I could do this no problem at all.&nbsp; I think it has a be a large amount like 500 or something for the giant eagle by me to ID you.

				^ Um, saving up for a car costs a LOT more than spending a few bitcoins, and takes much more effort than acquiring bitcoins. There&#039;s buying the car, getting insurance, registration, licensing if you don&#039;t have one, and mechanical upkeep...you&#039;re probably some 16 year old who doesn&#039;t understand that.
