				If the forums go down, is there any good place to keep an eye on to see if/when raids on buyers/sellers starts going down so one can prepare hot coffee and maybe some hash brownies to offer the gentlemen who might knock on our doors?

				Well King, I believe the young lady IS serious. <br /><br />Maria - Reddit was always the &quot;last resort&quot; to go to, as per DPR. - At least the one using that name at the time. I don&#039;t know who&#039;ve they got now, except to say, it&#039;s not the same guy who came on during the great blackout of Silk Road last November (2012), and begged us to be patient. <br /><br />Shit, I hated forums prior to that. I&#039;ve been a member of so many that use this same old boring template, that hasn&#039;t changed in 12 years. <br /><br />Reddits format is worse. I mean &#039;graphics&#039;? - Hello? - It&#039;s very rudimentary, but I just spent 2 hours over there. There is a shitload of information, links ot some vendors webpages. - Yes! One of my favs! - Ok here&#039;s one of the links - I don&#039;t see the dedicated one for SR, but someone said it&#039;s down <br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1nmqve/rsilkroad_goes_private/<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/1nmtae/websites_of_silk_road_vendors/<br /><br />Here&#039;s a list of known SR Vendors who are on BMR site. <br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/reloaded/comments/1nn9hy/list_of_sr_vendors_who_according_to_the_forum/

How did my text make you think it was written in the purpose of being funny?<br />It is not a dead serious question like I think there are answers that will have a big impact on my life. Just regular curiosity.<br />I guess if there will be any &quot;mass arrests&quot; or similar I will get to read it in the newspapers sooner or later.<br />Maybe it will be in the buzz on BMR forums rather quickly, possibley even before the regular news, aswell.<br />Any other suggestions?<br /><br />Funny to see you taught movies, books and cartoons would be things that result in creativity, &quot;crazyness&quot; and jokes these days. Would have been less suprised if you asked what drugs I had taken to come up with them. But the truth is I think its mostly blogs, forums, videotubes and social media that twists our brians these days. (People still read books and watch movies these days?)
