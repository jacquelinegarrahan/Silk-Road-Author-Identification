				Just realized after reading qTTTTp&#039;s thread (please no more capslock btw) that I haven&#039;t come across a consensus or tip of getting rid of the letters and boxes my drugs are coming in. (I don&#039;t remember anything in the buyer&#039;s guide mentioning this.)<br /><br />The first handful I bagged and threw into an unrelated dumpster. Now, I&#039;ll start tearing off the labels bearing the shipper&#039;s info and mine, and I guess any tracking numbers or other post info slapped on it. <br /><br />Burning or shredding these labels seems enough right now, but any other steps or advice? What&#039;s your method of securing your end, after receiving it (besides RTS)? What about residue on plastic; wash then throw away, or something else?

				Tear off all labels, rip em up very finely with my hands. Toss out packing materials in public outside trashcans, scatter torn up labels in various cans. I suppose burning the labels would do as well. I also remove and tear up labels from legit packages

				I wouldn&#039;t want to get my home raided with a stockpile of empty packages from vendors, but other than that, I don&#039;t see how they are at all incriminating.&nbsp; They&#039;re just one of of hundreds of BILLIONS of pieces of mail discarded annually.<br /><br />No one is ever going to pick one up out of the trash and say &quot;Ooohhhh, DRUGS were mailed in THIS one.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;ll concede that as part of a larger investigation LE might find them in your trash after digging through it and try to make some sort of connection... but if they&#039;re already digging through your trash then you&#039;ve fucked up in a major way and are probably standing in much deeper shit than you realize.<br /><br />I don&#039;t keep empty SR packages at home, and I discard them promptly the next time I venture out.&nbsp; Other than that, I don&#039;t give them a second thought.

				<br />When I get my stuff I rip off the little labels with country and such and tear them to pieces, toss in different place. Then I shred <br /><br />the envelopes. I also wash out the vac seal plastics and shred those too. Crosscut shredder. Sometimes I burn if I&#039;m having a <br /><br />fire outside, I&#039;m usually on the substance I received when having said fire&nbsp; ;)

				Getting rid of documents and packaging securely is a miniscule step that can save you a lot of grief. This doesn&#039;t just apply to drug evidence; identity theft is a huge concern and if someone wishes to impersonate you for any reason, the first step they will take is rifling through your trash. It sounds ridiculous, but your garbage is a goldmine of compromising documentation and there are plenty of people who are more than happy to dig through soggy newspapers and food wrappers for such papers that have been carelessly discarded. Identity theft costs literally hundreds of billions of dollars each year.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In short, you should be eliminating mail regularly anyway. As for an easy, cheap and irreversible method to do so, incineration is perfect. I shred official personal documents that aren&#039;t important enough to file, but the packaging of less legitimate deliveries are simply burned in the kitchen sink for extra security.

				Burning them is by far the best method. If you are worried in doing this method than shredding them and dumping them in a garbage can away from your location is another good method.

				I&#039;m extremely careful in every aspect of using SR, perhaps I&#039;m naive but this all seems a bit overboard. If LE knew what was in the package, you wouldn&#039;t have received the package in the first place.<br /><br />The risk is having packages laying in your trash from previous orders if you get busted on a current order and they search your house. Since many vendors use the same handful of return addresses, safer than a fake one, they can either flag those as past packages you&#039;ve received which puts more holes in your plausible deniability defense.<br /><br />So how I look at it is, as long as no new orders are coming in, the risk is low enough you can just throw them away as long as it isn&#039;t sitting in your trash when a new order arrives, otherwise you can dispose of them the next day by just throwing them in the trash on your way to work or such.<br /><br />Would be far more suspicious if I frequently sat in my back yard or garage burning packaging.

				I shred mine with a crosscutting shredder. I shred all of my mail that I don&#039;t want to save, because I&#039;m worried about identity theft. I save all my shredded paper, and eventually burn it (not for added paranoia, but because I do raku pottery)
