				Have you searched the forums or even looked at the stickied threads? <br /><br />Sign up for one of the classes on PGP encryption hosted by &quot;pine&quot;. Here&#039;s the link to the PGP club she hosts: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938<br /><br />As for obtaining bitcoins. Go to bitinstant.com, or to bitmarket.eu. Both sites have guides on how to obtain bitcoins, just read through it carefully and slowly. Read their guides more than once if it doesn&#039;t sink in right away.<br /><br />How do you get your package safely? Go to SR&#039;s wiki and read their tips. Pretty much, just have it sent to your residence in your name. It&#039;s as simple as that. Don&#039;t open the package right away, and write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it. If you get LE banging on your door, don&#039;t talk to them without a lawyer. Writing &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package can only help you in the long run. If nobody&#039;s banging on your door after a whole night of waiting, you&#039;re in the clear.<br /><br /><br />READ THIS: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0
