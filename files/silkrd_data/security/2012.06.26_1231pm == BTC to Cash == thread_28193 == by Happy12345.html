I&#039;m happy to send dollars in principle but it would take longer than other vendors who are based in the US such as UglySurfer on SR who sells $50 and $20 bills. You can of course just send the money to MtGox and withdraw it to your account depending on how much it is. I&#039;m currently reading an anti money laundering book and it tells me the threshold in the US is around $10,000 - it is much lower here in the UK! <br /><br />If you have BTC to spare I would suggest you use them to buy bonds on the Bitcoin stock exchange and just pay the interest into your bank account over time. The best person to ask if you need to conceal large amounts is the moderator Limetless.<br /><br />V.
