				If the TSA body scanners were not bad enough, now there is a technology that allows remote body scanning of people within a certain radius (several meters). Anyone carrying contraband can easily be identified. Innocent people can also enjoy these virtual pat downs from a distance :/. Feels like it is only a matter of time until this becomes more mainstream amongst state/government organizations for use on their citizens. <br />Any tips on mitigating this fascist inspired technology?<br /><br /><br />https://modernsurvivalblog.com/security/terahertz-radiation-scanners-for-nyc-cops/

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Terahertz radiation can pass through clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics. It can also penetrate fog and clouds, but cannot penetrate metal or water.<br /><br />Terahertz radiation can be used in surveillance, such as security screening, to uncover concealed weapons on a person, remotely. Many materials ‘of interest’ have unique spectral “fingerprints” in the terahertz range. This offers the possibility to combine spectral identification with imaging.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Metal and water, eh? So vials might be out.. I&#039;d be interested to find out the level of sensitivity this thing has; could it tell the difference between a baggie of e and a pack of aspirin for example. Or a vial of lucy drops from an actual breath freshener bottle.<br /><br />I have a strange feeling we&#039;ll be hearing from fizzy soon :)

				Who knows the capability and accuracy of this device, all we know is that it&#039;s getting bigger and better as time goes by.<br />Lets hope this dude Fizzy can drop some knowledge.

				Put your contraband into a flask and carry that around with you.&nbsp; It&#039;s not illegal to carry one as long as the lid is sealed and they are made of metal.<br /><br />PS: That chick has huge titties and doesn&#039;t look very happy that the pig is staring at them with his uber THz scanner
