				I read in some thread here you should send your public keys only encrypted. Really don&#039;t understand why, if it is public keys.<br /><br />And what about upload them in a keyserver? They can track it back to you? Even if you are using liberte or tails?

				Well, at least Alice or Bob has to send their public key unencrypted.<br /><br />Best thing -&gt;<br /><br />Person A sends public key with plaintext.<br />Person B encrypts their public key with Person A&#039;s public key and sends that to Person A.<br />Person A decrypts Person B&#039;s message to find Person B&#039;s public key. Person A makes a new public key and encrypts that with Person B&#039;s public key.<br />Person B decrypts and obtains Person A&#039;s new public key<br /><br />Now you are twice as secure as before. The outer &#039;shell&#039; of encryption must be broken before getting access to the inner shell of encryption. A bit mind boggling though.<br /><br />Notice how one could potentially exchange dozens of &#039;nested&#039; public keys to enhance PGP to any level of security you wanted. That, I reckon, is the seed of ideas like the Tor onion routing network.<br /><br />Doing too much of this is kinda pointless for the majority of messages sent. Much like using weak passwords on sites like the NY Times or WSJ, since it&#039;s not exactly pivotal if an attacker gains access, you ought to use different levels of cryptography for different purposes.<br /><br />Obviously if you need stronger encryption that what PGP can offer, then your main attack vector is far more likely to be a keylogger to obtain your passphrase or LE malware to get a copy of your private key.<br />

				Didn&#039;t get where is the lack of security.<br /><br />In this case, every seller here would be vulnerable?
