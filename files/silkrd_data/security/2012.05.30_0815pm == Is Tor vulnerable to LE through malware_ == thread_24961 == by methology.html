				Should I be worried that Tor project updates TorBrowser every few weeks? Should I sweat that LE has coerced Tor Project to include malware within the TorBrowser itself.

				^This guy paranoid much..&quot;coerced&quot;....TOR is philosophically against government censorship; just remember TOR doesn&#039;t just support kids who wanna score drugs. The TOR project is also being used by NGO&#039;s in foreign countries, opposition political parties in Libya/Iran and the US government&#039;s own spies in Afghanistan just to name a few. <br /><br />I can&#039;t see the TOR project keeling over to government interests and installing spyware just because of SR, just yet.....The TOR project is more than just about CP and buying afghan heroin. <br /><br />Anyway the relays are dispersed and run by volunteers, FBI gonna find it hard to play &quot;Gotta catch em&#039; all&quot;.

				Plus it&#039;s open source. Not that anyone really takes the time to comb through all the source code, but if there was something that LE had intentionally put in there, it&#039;s there for everyone to see. Malware introduced intentionally into open source projects tends to get caught pretty quick, especially if they have a good checkout/check in system.

				Exactly, &quot;caught pretty quick.&quot; I don&#039;t think Tor would imbed malware knowingly, but I can see where infiltration could get something into a build and it could reeside there just long enough to expose something. I am a software developer and I&#039;ve left many benign Easter-eggs in software I&#039;ve built for large corporations. Getting to SR could easily be through the obvious. As I said, I would fuck with Tor and BitCoin covertly.<br /><br />HAL5000, nice ass!
