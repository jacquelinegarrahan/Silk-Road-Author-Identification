				Hey all, recently on one of my other accounts, my &quot;purchasing account&quot; someone decided to login to it, and cancel an order I had placed and then sent the BTC to their personal wallet, after wards they changed my password.&nbsp; &nbsp;What bothers me the most isn&#039;t the stolen password, but the fact that someone went out and cancelled my order for a very RARE substance I was planning on adding to my collection. The seller doesn&#039;t seem to be listing anymore either.&nbsp; <br /><br />So for those who were involved back in the MtGox database hack, change your password/username from your MtGox accounts, I believe that is how they are doing this. <br /><br />It was part stupidity on my part as I should have changed my password after that point.<br /><br />Just a friendly warning to all those out there. <br /><br />

				Checked hidden wiki, looks like this is more likely part of a new SR phishing scheme, and not so much related to the MTGox security breaches.&nbsp; If you have been getting on SR through the links on the hidden wiki, CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; I just lost 20 BTC

				people are changing the SRM link on the hidden wiki to a phishing site that looks like the real SRM, but actually steals your password. this is not something new. guard against it by not using the hidden wiki link.<br /><br />more info: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70.0

				If they are getting it from mtgox db leak I&#039;d be even more worried that once they figure your SR account they can now most likely tie you to your real identity. Thats alot worst than losing some BTC IMO. :( But ya its prob from phishing scam at this point... Sucks people are still falling for it.

				I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s August and we are still talking about the MTGOX/hiddenwiki phishing site issues.<br />These things have been repeatedly been warned about and everyone should have it in their head <br />your Silk Road Identity and Password should be a highly secure setup.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry truly for losses on because of these incidents but hopefully this is a wakeup call for you. There are people out there that constantly looking to do harm to others for money and lulz. My guess it&#039;s more lulz than the money. <br /><br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath
