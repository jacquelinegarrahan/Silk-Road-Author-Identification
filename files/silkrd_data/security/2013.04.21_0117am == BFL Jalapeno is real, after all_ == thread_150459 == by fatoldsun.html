				What a disgusting fat neckbeard walking stereotype doing the unboxing, I&#039;m ashamed that when people think of bitcoin and cryptocurrency that&#039;s probably who they think of, looks like I&#039;ll be keeping every bit of it a secret.

				The tech community in general has its stereotypical characters... doesn&#039;t mean that good stuff for the rest of us ;)<br /><br />BTW, for your own anonymity, don&#039;t start discussing that you&#039;re number X in line for the next batch of BFLs or whatever.<br />

				So the smallest miner costs $274 and has a 5 GH/s hash rate at 30 W. I plugged those numbers into a mining calculator and found it would generate 0.3 BTC per day. At current market price, that would be $260 a week. Not bad really. I would like to buy 2 or 3 of them... except by the time they are delivered, the hash rate will be 10 times higher.<br />

				Me being ignorant of mining, I&#039;m curious...<br /><br />What&#039;s the consensus... is it already too late to break even?&nbsp; Like if you were to purchase/ get in line like right now.&nbsp; Or even those currently waiting, are those guys even going to make their money back?<br /><br />I&#039;ve poked around, but I cant find any solid mathematical solution... I mean there&#039;s profitability calculators, but with all the variables it seems pretty much like it&#039;s all guesswork.&nbsp; No?<br /><br />

				The first ones will. Look at my analysis above. You should make your money back in 8 days, but that&#039;s when nobody else has an ASIC. When everyone does, and the hash rate goes up 10, 30, 100 fold, it will only be worthwhile for serious miners, like it is now.<br />

				What I find hard to understand is e420Kush. Associating drugs and bitcoins in RL?! <br /><br />On the general subject of application specific processing, it&#039;s an arms race I&#039;ve stayed clear of. If you&#039;ve been at it from the start, fair enough. But otherwise expect to be putting down hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep ahead shortly. Things are only going to get more insane.<br /><br />While it was with CPUs and GPUs, there was always the fallback case of selling your equipment to cover your losses if things got bad, but that&#039;s no longer an option so I&#039;m stepping out. Bitcoin mining will probably be exclusively done by botnets and supercomputers in the end.<br /><br />I think there are better ways to make money out of the bitcoin economy than mining, like offering actual services and products based upon new business models that can&#039;t easily exist in a regulated world. People should be focusing on hastening the transition of the black market economy off the dollar and onto the BTC, that&#039;s where the real money is at.
