				I would use local bitcoins but there&#039;s no one close to me :(<br />I&#039;ve tried to get on bitinstant as a guest, but it didn&#039;t work. I tried to make an account and every time I clicked submit it just wouldn&#039;t go through. I&#039;ve tried firefox, and chrome and even tor with no luck.<br />I&#039;m only trying to buy around 40 dollars worth of btc&#039;s. Should I just go through coinbase? Damnit damnit damnit.

				They are still down for me as well.&nbsp; This is ridiculous they should have fixed this by now.&nbsp; This new beta version of the site was release almost two weeks ago now and they still haven&#039;t gotten it working or rolled back.

				Use blue sky traders.....they are legit. emailed them last night .....they emailed me deposit info by morning, deposited cash into their BofA account on my lunch break and had my coins by the time i came home. no fake name or alias needed. Very fast and only about a $10 fee for $400 in coins.

				Yeah I&#039;ve only used bit instant once and it worked like a charm but after seeing everyone&#039;s discontent with the new site I think I&#039;ll just be going through other trust worthy people.<br /><br />Since I owe someone money though I just decided to buy btc&#039;s through coinbase and from there I&#039;ll just transfer them into my blockchain wallet and pay them through that. Sucks that I have to wait a whole week though :/<br />Man fuck you Bit Instant &gt;:(

				Bank of America is closed I think on the weekends, but if you have not found any by Monday, you could buy them here at Bank of America:<br /><br />http://www.bitcoin-brokers.org/buy-bitcoins-at-bank-of-america/<br /><br />Looks like up to 3BTC are available at the moment.

				Do you need an ID for that bitcoin-brokers.org thing?&nbsp; Can I use a fake name or address?
