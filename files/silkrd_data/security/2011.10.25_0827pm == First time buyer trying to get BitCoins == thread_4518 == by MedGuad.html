				I hope this is the proper forum for this type of post, my apologies if it is not.&nbsp; <br /><br />First time buyer trying to get in on all of this.&nbsp; I created a Dwolla account and transferred my money there from my bank (this took almost a week of waiting).&nbsp; Once the money was in Dwolla I tried transferring it to my Tradehill account.&nbsp; For some reason it says the fraud check failed and now I don&#039;t see my USD in either Dwolla or Tradehill&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />I put in a support request with TradeHill trying to find the problem.&nbsp; Everything was legitimate unless I did something wrong.&nbsp; While I&#039;m waiting for TradeHill to respond, what could have gone wrong??&nbsp; Am I going about this the right way?<br /><br />Thank you!

				yeah, the lags u described are real: the week from bank to dwolla.&nbsp; Then because of problems with dwolla reneging on cashed checks, tradehill started using bitinstant as a &#039;go between&#039; ...and for about a week there, bitinstant was down.&nbsp; Many of us just figured &#039;enough&#039; and started using exchangebitcoin, and they folded...but bitinstant had come back up, and it sounds like that&#039;s where your money is.<br /><br />It&#039;s good u sent tradehill a post on it...I&#039;d also send one to bitinstant, u can see they are the intermediary by clicking on the tradehill links, in &#039;deposit&#039; and then &#039;usd&#039; and then &#039;dwolla&#039;&nbsp; but this is the curse of btc, how hard they are to trace, once u click on link. <br />&nbsp;<br />Good luck with all this...many have now moved on to get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; And they work fine...so far...

				Thanks for the reply. I originally misspoke about sending a ticket to tradehill... I meant BitInstant.&nbsp; I contacted BitInstant about it and they replied this morning saying they would refund the money to my Dwolla account (still not there yet) and that the issue was because I was trying to get funds from my bank (which I wasn&#039;t). <br /><br />They said it shouldn&#039;t happen again though... Now I&#039;m just waiting for my money to get back to Dwolla so I can try to transfer again.&nbsp; My plan is Dwolla -&gt; BitInstant -&gt; TradeHill -&gt; BitCoins!&nbsp; Hopefully that will work.&nbsp; Would you recommend get-bitcoin instead?<br /><br />Thanks for the advice and help.&nbsp; I&#039;m really kind of overwhelmed by the whole process but looking forward to start shopping :)

				Thank you! I got the cash back in my Dwolla account.&nbsp; Can someone please confirm what to do next?&nbsp; Bitinstant is telling me this issue shouldn&#039;t happen again when trying to transfer to Tradehill.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does it go Dwolla -&gt; Bitinstant -&gt; Tradehill?<br /><br />Also I didn&#039;t know about the instantwallets.&nbsp; I will get a few of these Thanks!

				Edit:<br /><br />Good news I have the funds in my tradehill account!!&nbsp; So the next step is to buy bitcoins and transfer them to my wallets?&nbsp; I might wait to see if the bitcoin exchange drops a bit more before doing so unless you guys recommend I go ahead.&nbsp; Thank you all!

				I have nothing to add, except as a newbie, I feel your pain.&nbsp; I used MtGox and it all went fine (after the week of waiting for Dwolla to clear).&nbsp; I think I will try the above suggestions next time...

				I&#039;ve used get-bitcoin&#039;s cash through mail with success. No ID or anything needed right now. Part that makes me most nervous is sending cash via mail of course. Could insure it but then paper trail. Risks everywhere I suppose.

				Yep, part of the learning process here, is getting your bitcoins without going crazy ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;Tradehill or MtGox are slow, but fairly reliable...<br /><br />Best, all time, for me, is now get-bitcoin.com .... using the cash option, u just can go to any Bank of America or Wells Fargo branch, and deposit into the account# they give you, then email them a copy of receipt, and within a few hours you have your btc....but if you want to sit on dollars, then you need one of the exchanges TH or MTG ....<br /><br />Buying on here, other than sumyungai I don&#039;t recommend at this time...way too many scams....and I&#039;ve never bought from sum, but he&#039;s recommended by people I trust....most of the others have turned out to be rips, so we&#039;re super cautious about buying btc on SR itself...

				Question on get-bitcoin.com..... Do they email you after they confirm your deposit or only after you make a deposit request?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know they say coins will show up within 24 hours but most are saying they&nbsp; have them in a few hours???&nbsp; Damm I miss exchb. :-(&nbsp; &nbsp;They were amazingly fast.&nbsp; I will be patiently watching my wallet I guess.

				Okay so I&#039;ve been very carefully trying to formulate how to go through with getting BTCs. So far this is my plan:<br /><br />Bank of America deposit to getbitcoin --&gt; dwolla --&gt; bitinstant --&gt; tradehill --&gt; some to one instawallet, others to another instawallet, and then these to N instawallets until there is a last instawallet that goes to SR<br /><br />alternatively:<br />create throw-away SL account and buy lindens on Virwox via paypal, trade lindens for BTCs and then instawallets??<br /><br />I&#039;ve been mulling over this for about two hours now when I should be studying for toxicology!

				Thanks Phuba....Yeah I sent them another email asking for confirmation and they got back to me within a minute of hitting send...lol.&nbsp; Wish my coins were as fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had really come to love ExchB so we will see about get-bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t even want to think about dealing with moneypak.&nbsp; <br />I do miss the ability to keep some $$$ and instantly buy some coins like before.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The waiting is the hardest part.....

				I&#039;ve used get-bitcoin for the first time yesterday, deposited cash at the bank and received my btc this morning.&nbsp; Fairly large order too and they were fast so I highly recommend them.

				Hey A8n, you don&#039;t need an account of BoA (fuck all major banks) or ID.<br />Tellers could care less what you do, seriously. I&#039;ve had a different one everytime, and they just go about their business. Just be normal and fit in with society. I advise not depositing over 1000 USD at one time though, to bypass that, you can visit multiple BoA. If you get a couple of deposit slips while you&#039;re there, you can fill them out at home, and go through the drive through. I can confirm this works because I&#039;ve done it before for ExchB, and will do the same for get-bitcoin.

				Yep, I mean, *nobody* in the whole transaction knows me...I can put any first name I want--that&#039;s all I&#039;ve used--both on get-bitcoin order, and on bank deposit....it&#039;s actually *better* than exchangebtc was, in that area, since you don&#039;t have to give shit to join, while exchangebtc u did<br /><br />...you do need an email addy, but, u know, doesn&#039;t matter which one, as long as you know it, cuz that&#039;s how they answer you...and name &#039;what&#039;s in a name&#039; ha ha....and with instawallet being as secure as it is, not much reason IMO, not to just keep it all in the cloud...a lot faster transferring around, too...and less on desktop...<br /><br />It&#039;s a great, anonymous setup, so far...and yesterday they were giving out free lunch...for a few of us anyway ;)
