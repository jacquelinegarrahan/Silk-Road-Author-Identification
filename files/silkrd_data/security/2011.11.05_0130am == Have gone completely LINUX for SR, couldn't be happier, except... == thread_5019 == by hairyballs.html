				Moved all my SR info onto a debian liveusb, everything went smooth so far. PGP keys renewed, truecrypt setup etc.<br /><br />One problem I&#039;m stuck with is being unable to get Pidgin working SILC properly.<br /><br />I followed the instructions on the SILC chat thread, but it always says unable to connect, I&#039;ve checked the SOCKS settings etc.<br /><br />Anyone else having trouble connecting to the chat on linux?<br /><br />Other than that, everything is running great.&nbsp; 8)

				Hi,<br /><br />I done exactly the same today onto a MSI wind 230. I had the same problem. My fix was goto vidalia, message log and look for &#039;socks listener listening on poer xxxxx&#039;. YOu need to goto manage accounts in your pidgiin, edit your details and change the port to listening port thats stated. This changes everytime you load TOR so be awre that you have to change it when you do.<br /><br />My problem, i imported my keys but they dont work, how do you renew them/make them work?<br /><br />Hope this helps ;)

				No problem, Can someone help me with how to use PGP keys once ive &#039;exported to file&#039; then &#039;imported from file&#039; on new system. i can see keys but it says theres no key and what not there, when there blatently is. <br /><br />Thinking of re-install though with Debian and not MINT though so might end up being irrelivent. Weekend now though, Lets have fun :)

				Yeah, I used the above terminal inputs to make gnupg export a private key. Then used gpa interface to import it!<br />&nbsp;;D<br />

				Thanks for the tip!<br /><br />I have also found that a debian setup is also quite faster than tails... <br /><br />Tails is a good all-in-one package but you need to sacrifice a few comforts.<br /><br />

				I have been trying all the different linux OS&#039;s and it seems I get one thing like truecrypt working great, but not TOR or vise versu.&nbsp; I can get ubuntu running great with everything installed and then after a couple of times it will not load.<br /><br />Part of the fun is figuring out the problems and I am now trying a different USB installer, but what set up are you running?

				Think im scrapping MINT (now i have it all working :/) for debian with boot sector on USB key and main drive encrypted. Seems the most solid :)<br /><br />

				Tails has everything I need, except keypassx ... but I just thro that in right after I get the updates....I don&#039;t need gpa or kleopatra or nothing, just use the built in tails gpg deal...and the firefox / iceweasel addon .... but yeah, all kinds of different ways to do it...since I need so little, I&#039;ve studied some of the lightweight linux distros on a flash drive...puppylinux and my favorite, xpud .... but the three already made, privatix, liberte linux, and tails, have so many little great things that they are much easier than me trying to build one, tho I like to try ....&nbsp; and mostly I&quot;m staying more and more in the cloud with anything I&#039;ll need, using a dropbox like storage site, and just keeping it all in a folder I can download quickly to my linux Desktop....<br /><br />ON pgp, I just export all my keys I&#039;ve put together on gpa on my desktop, put them in a file...then when I get Tails, or whatever linux distro I need up, just &#039;import&#039; that file, containing all the public keys....along with my keepassx file, with my url&#039;s and usernames and passwords for my tor sites...<br /><br />fun fun fun...

				Anything running on Windows should be considered unsafe, plus the feds have historically done application layer attacks (against browsers, chat programs etc.) rather than straight traffic analysis. If you are using an OS like Hardened Gentoo or OpenBSD this risk goes down a lot. Search this forum for &quot;CIPAV&quot; to find some documents about this.
