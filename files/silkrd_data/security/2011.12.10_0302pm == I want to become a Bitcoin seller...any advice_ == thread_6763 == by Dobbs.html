				and no, I wont rip people off..I think there&#039;s enough money to be made buying and selling bitcoins that there&#039;s really no need to rip people.<br /><br />I think, and I may be wrong, the only thing illegal would be to not report the income from the bitcoins?&nbsp; SR only wants around $150 to open a sellers account...<br /><br />Im open to all suggestions here.

				DON&#039;T! Warning!! Don&#039;t!! DO NOT BECOME A BITCOIN SELLER/EXCHANGER. It will ruin you. There are a few good exchangers around but..... honestly when BTC Buddy is on, HE IS ON!!! There is no competition and you will be broke. Or at least not an exchanger anymore. I suggest you find another endeavors. That market is just about cornered

But don&#039;t you think it&#039;s a little sneaky posting all over the forums abut how BTC Buddy is the best exchanger when you ARE BTC Buddy?

				jklpoyt--- Jealous...? #1 no. Not sneaky. Honest.&nbsp; #2 you can&#039;t prove it and so what?<br />&nbsp;I put everyone to shame at whatever I do. Ask you significant other.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; OH!&nbsp; I am a champion! But this isn&#039;t about me. This is about btc exchange. I have plenty of time to poke fun at you later. I may start a thread. <br /><br />Dobbs---&nbsp; Lol. Try. Go ahead. There is a TON of btc out there. Mt.Gox got um all. Go get um and bring them on site. Please. I am sure you will do okay for a while. Especially if you are friendly, quick and honest. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; I look forward to watching your progression.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)&nbsp; This IS going to be good.<br /><br />I thought rich folks got things done. Where you at? I haven&#039;t seen you around the exchangers water cooler yet.&nbsp; Lol. <br />Watch. In about 3 months (That long only b/c he&#039;s rich) Dobbs will be asking for loans. 3btc loans at a time just won&#039;t be enough. Flipping his cardboard sign between traffic lights.&nbsp; &quot;Will work for bitcoins&quot; on one side. Which no one driving by understands. And &quot;God Bless/ Hungry&quot; on the other side. Oh Dobbs... Poor, POOR Dobbs.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				You&#039;re funny&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />We&#039;ll see...I&#039;m still thinking about it.&nbsp; I want to have a business plan in place, with a projected point of return and all that.&nbsp; I&#039;m still doing my market research at this point.<br /><br />Bitcoins are going up now, wonder if its just because of the holidays or if its a trend.&nbsp;
