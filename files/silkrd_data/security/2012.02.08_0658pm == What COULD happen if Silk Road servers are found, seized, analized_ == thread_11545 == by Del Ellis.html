				First off, I have a great deal of faith in SR and the administrator(s)&#039; ability to keep everything secure and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there are &quot;ripcords&quot; that could be pulled if shit hits the fan to render the data unrecoverable by law enforcement.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m a little curious as to what the implications could be if law enforcement computer forensics types somehow hit the jackpot and could just raid wherever all of this data is sitting in one fell swoop. I&#039;m not trying to speculate or pry for details about how the data is stored if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking reading this.<br /><br />Forgive my ignorance as my understanding of bitcoin is, well, not very thorough. But since all bitcoin transactions are a matter of public record, what would happen if LE (or some rogue hacker group or anybody) got hold of all of the wallet data, the guts of the dummy transaction tumbler, all of that. Could they even possibly recover the bitcoin addresses used to deposit to this site, all of the bitcoin addresses used to make withdrawals to e-wallets and bitcoin exchanges (many of which are legit clearnet companies,) and subpoena these companies to provide personal information about sellers and customers alike, based on historical data about bitcoin addresses used to send/receive payments from SR?<br /><br />What I&#039;m mostly concerned about is the little blurb that you can still use your old deposit bitcoin addresses indefinitely even if you have requested a new one. Does that mean somewhere there&#039;s a mySQL database or something containing all of these, directly able to link them to our accounts account? Would it not be possible to then trace back all of the &quot;hops&quot; through the tumbler, to whatever exchanges and/or e-wallets we may have used?<br /><br />Maybe the nature of bitcoin inherently prevents this kind of thing from even being possible or provable from a forensics standpoint. Maybe the dummy transaction tumbler permanently discards all intermediate addresses (or uses some proprietary system that can&#039;t be unscrambled or back-tracked) and thereby rendering them completely unable to trace a direct, provable link from exchange/ewallet-&gt;SR-&gt;exchange/ewallet but is that really the case?<br /><br />I guess only the administration can answer this definitively, and all we can really do is speculate, and I don&#039;t blame the administration for not even wanting to answer these kinds of questions in a public forum. If this has been debated and answered ad nauseum, I apologize. I&#039;m just really concerned and curious about all of this.

Vendors who used mixes or unloaded them anonymously (much more difficult) will also be all right. Most everyone else will be fucked and susceptible to various financial network topology intelligence attacks, although most of them require large amounts of computing power to pull off. It all depends on how bored the feds are and badly they want to get some people behind bars. From my experiences with past criminal networks, the feds have ruthlessly owned people who were easy pickings while people who were still vulnerable but were more difficult targets got away (the specific case I&#039;m thinking of involved VPN use vs. Tor use).<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11545.msg107608#msg107608">Quote from: Del Ellis on February 08, 2012, 06:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What I&#039;m mostly concerned about is the little blurb that you can still use your old deposit bitcoin addresses indefinitely even if you have requested a new one.

				The DEA, FBI whatever would face the same problem they have when chasing professional drug dealers of the &quot;normal&quot; variety- it is not enough to see that there has been money changing hands, not enough that an informant says a person is selling, they have to connect any suspect to a transaction by solid evidence- for instance intercepting a sent package or somehow getting a seller&#039;s location, which is impossible with Tor if you have done things correctly.&nbsp; Look at the elements of any drug crime and you see that it is not easy, they have an uphill battle trying to prove these beyond a reasonable doubt with legal means that will stand up in court.&nbsp; And they are not going to be posing as sellers and arresting people who buy and send their addresses- that would be an &quot;attempted purchase of a controlled substance&quot; bust and in their and the public&#039;s eyes not worth the citation it was written on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Source: Criminal law paralegal

				It&#039;s also possible to figure out where cash goes between withdrawal and re-deposit. If for example you focus tracking on bills moving in and out of banks in a particular region and then further limit your scope by looking only at issuance to people thought to be part of drug networks and deposits from retailers and those same people, you will typically create a thin map that enters a steady state after around a year.<br /><br />That map will have some holes in it but the feds can always fill it out with human intelligence by busting known important nodes and squeezing them for info on their transactions. Don&#039;t fuck with cash. :-)

				There&#039;s a point where caution turns into unhealthy paranoia.&nbsp; If LEAs take SR&#039;s servers and attempt to arrest its customers, there&#039;s a finite amount of effort they&#039;re going to be willing to put forth into tracking them down.&nbsp; Now if you don&#039;t use any security beyond TOR and ship to your house?&nbsp; Yeah, they&#039;ll probably find you.<br /><br />But no LEA in the world is going to be willing to track down the serial numbers of individual cash bills used in transactions like this, especially not given that they would have thousands of transactions to deal with.&nbsp; They just don&#039;t care enough.&nbsp; Now if you were doing something much worse than drug sales, like organizing murders or whatnot, then they might care.<br /><br />But if all you do is make the occasional purchase or are a small-time vendor, just put just a little bit of extra effort into security and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; Your enemy&#039;s apathy is the greatest defense you can ever possess.&nbsp;

				Interesting discussion here.&nbsp; My question is this:<br /><br />IF SR servers and data were compromised and the data they got off it could possibly link buyers to transactions made and recieved on SR, and then based on that information they got a search warrant of the residence in question, would they still need to actually find the substance in question or at the very least some illegal substance? I might be wrong and probably am but while they may be able to bring charges against you, wouldn&#039;t they need to find actual physical evidence against you to make any kind of conviction?&nbsp; So as long as your house is free of illegal substances they will not be able to convict you of anything, despite any evidence they can gather online from prior transactions?<br /><br />Of course the point is probably moot as most of us probably have drugs in our places at most times anyway, but still I would like to know.

				If they don&#039;t find physical drugs they could still try to charge you for various crimes related to drugs but they will have a much much much harder time getting anything to stick.
