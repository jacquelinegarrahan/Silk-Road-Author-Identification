				I think the most useful method to move money freely and without raising suspicions is to have a bank account with a fake name, and be able to control the funds&nbsp; online and through the ATM.<br /><br />The thing is that is does not look easy to get one. Where I live, maybe in a small bank with a fairly decent fake ID card you could get a bank employer to open you a bank account, but still it is quite risky. After you have the first one, it is easy to open other accounts in online banks that just require a deposit from another of your bank accounts.<br /><br />Do you have any other idea on how to open a bank account with a fake name?<br /><br />Cheers!

				You need good faked photo I.D and 2 letters with corresponding name or you need to know a bent bank employee,&nbsp; It is possible to get a whole new identity- birth certificate with corresponding I.D but its disrespectful to the dead, thats all im saying ....

				Worked for a ton of banks. If we spelled your name wrong the back office would be on us like hot shit. The department that verifies all new accounts would be extremely hard to get one over. Plus the credit check first thing, check systems etc etc.

				Bro do not fuck with BANKS!! point blank, if you wanna launder money bro BITCOINS in perfect!!! open several bitcoins wallets and use the diffrent options to have the bitcoins&nbsp; cashed... you can send them to paypal then from paypal send them to a prepaid debt card etc, DONT GO MESSING WITH BANKS and fake ids etc, Unless somehow you get someone in the DMV to give you a ID withwhatever you want maybe, but then you still have the SS# issue... I could acually do it, probley im the III of my family and my grandfather is dead and i have his ss#, but im not risking that. Also i have my cousions dob ss# and could get his drivers licence #, i would do that but in another state.. You can have fake id&#039;s made on SR, iv thought about useing my cousions info, because my drivers Liscence is suspended and iv thought about having a ID made and then going and getting a &quot;NEW drivers liscence in the state 20min from me, but im not sure, does anyone know about the situation i jjust explain? or could help me out? I dont wanna mess with banks i just wanna be able to drive and if im pulled not go to jail...As iv said i have my cousion s DOB SS#...that would be enough for a great fake id, i dunnno though any thoughts

				In canada its super hard without valid ID....<br /><br />First you need an SIN#<br /><br />Then they run a credit check....<br /><br />if all goes well after that its just one more thing.....<br /><br />A rectal exam!!!<br /><br />Fucking banks in Canada are so tightass its unbelievable. They need everything from your mothers maiden name, bills in your name, previous employment, current employment....<br /><br />Its ridiculous!!!! <br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:(

				<br />If you can get your hands on some fakes of these:<br /><br />- A notarized copy of the valid passport. Possible to fake (the dont check the notary)<br />- Bank reference from a bank. Possible to fake (they will call the bank, if you have access to a landline divert to prepaid mobile) <br />- Second reference from a professional. Easy<br />- Proof of residential address. Too easy (utility bill)<br /><br />You can open a personal account in Belize for $800 + $1000 minimum balance.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to talk to anyone. Nothing is tied to you. You get a visa card witha tasty limit. <br /><br />Obscure your face over atm&#039;s and voila!<br /><br />Also...with balls It&#039;s possible to do this alone...there&#039;s no need to involve anyone else. Identity fraud seriously fucks with peoples lives.

				Since 9/11 and the subsequent PATRIOT Act - yeah, it&#039;s actually an acronym... - the US government has access to untold amounts of banking information. If you don&#039;t get caught at first, you&#039;ll be caught eventually.<br /><br />Don&#039;t. Fucking. Mess. With. Banks.
