				Not sure if this will make people nervous, but figured it was worth an attempt.<br /><br />Without giving away stupid details, can we have a crash course to cold copping IRL?<br /><br />My instinct is this is the way to stay well and lay low while we await the true fallout from the SR bust, and personally I do not want to dive right into BMR or Sheep or &quot;SR2&quot; or any others that pop up.<br /><br />I have never cold copped.&nbsp; I have done some homework and know the basics.&nbsp; But this could be both a good &quot;Drug Safety&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; thread for those in need.<br /><br />Immediate questions that come to mind:<br /><br />Where do you start location wise in your area?<br /><br />How do you initiate the conversation?<br /><br />How do you manage risk/reward, for example with a middleman/runner?<br /><br />What are the common scam tactics?<br /><br />How do you manage risk/reward re: LE IRL buying?<br /><br />How do you get to that ideal connection that keeps you well but off the streets?&nbsp; Meaning the man that you get on your SMS and connect, or that man that delivers to your home, etc.<br /><br />This could be discussion of H or anything else.<br /><br />Lay low and stay safe everyone.&nbsp;

				Depends on your locale, depends on what you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for heroin or crack/coke... having a ghetto nearby is greatly advantageous:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In this case, to make things super easy your first time, all you need to do is drive through with some white people in the car... the crowds of people just seemingly standing around will come to life shouting out to you what they have.&nbsp; Just stop and let them walk/run up, confirm what they have, ask for what you want etc., and just make the swap.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously don&#039;t give them the money to just run away with it, let them show it to you as you&#039;re handing the money.&nbsp; <br /><br />-The bigger the crowd on the corner, the better... gangs making their money dealing don&#039;t want their customers getting ripped off, that would drive away all the customers once word gets out... they want customers to know that their spot is legit, and use force to keep things this way. <br /><br />-Go there at reasonable hours... like don&#039;t go at 1 AM, you&#039;re just going to get robbed.&nbsp; Even street dealers want to catch sleep or want some time to go kick it etc., don&#039;t expect them to be out 24/7.&nbsp; I&#039;d say not try to go pick up past 10 PM, and maybe you could go as early as 8 if you&#039;re lucky... outside of that, you&#039;re pushing your luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Don&#039;t get cornered... scammer robbers may try to get you to pull into some dead end alley or something similar, then proceed to rob you since you are surrounded with no way out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pull through their spot enough, they&#039;ll give you their number... maybe they even have someone doing delivery service that they deem you worthy of.&nbsp; Still, don&#039;t really trust them though...&nbsp;

				I would advise you to network and find connects through friends and associates rather than drive through the hood looking for drugs.

It&#039;s different from city to city. <br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />SF - Heroin &amp; Crack - Mission Street<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crack&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Tenderloin<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pharms&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Pill Hill (Leavenworth&amp;Golden Gate around block up to Eddy&amp;Hyde)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weed/Shrooms - Haight &amp; Ashbury<br /><br />Oakland - Pharms&nbsp; &nbsp; - Pill Hill (Between 27th and 35th &amp; MLK and Broadway)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crack&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - West Oakland Park<br /><br />Berkeley - Weed/Shrooms/Psychedelics&nbsp; &nbsp; - Telegraph<br /><br />There might be more in these areas I&#039;m not remembering at the moment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you initiate the conversation?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Best to let them initiate it. You don&#039;t want to come across too desperate either since you&#039;ll be too easily fleeced.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you manage risk/reward, for example with a middleman/runner?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You don&#039;t. You NEVER allow your money to walk. Make that point up front. If they try and insist anything else ... fuck it they&#039;re playing games. If they&#039;ve got it on them and they&#039;re going to sell to you, they&#039;ll do it right there and be chill about it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What are the common scam tactics?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oldest trick in the book is convincing you to have to go somewhere with them and springing on you that you need to give them the money so they can go get it. That&#039;s why as soon as you hear anything like that you make your point up front your money doesn&#039;t walk.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you manage risk/reward re: LE IRL buying?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The UC I&#039;ve encountered on the streets have always seemed really obvious for whatever reason. All the real slingers seem to spot them and melt away. ;D <br /><br />But it&#039;s usually better to let them offer it to you even though that&#039;s not always possible if you look too straight. But if someone offers something even if it&#039;s not what you&#039;re looking for you could ask for a referral.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How do you get to that ideal connection that keeps you well but off the streets?&nbsp; Meaning the man that you get on your SMS and connect, or that man that delivers to your home, etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In short, you spend lots of money ... well lots of money for the streets anyway where they&#039;re used to people buying dime bags. Again it depends what you&#039;re looking for, but generally whenever I&#039;ve dropped a bill or two or up on something I&#039;ve often gotten hooked up so I don&#039;t even have to go down there anymore. Sometimes they come to me or I go to them. But you want to make sure whoever it is you&#039;re buying it from is legit first. Like on your 2nd or 3rd order ... though sometimes that&#039;s not even possible if you&#039;re in a strange city like I&#039;ve found myself in a couple times but still gotten hooked up when I dropped a couple bills. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This could be discussion of H or anything else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Depends where you are but with H getting hooked up on the West Coast means getting a number where the Mexicans literally deliver to your doorstep within 15 minutes, or they give you a street corner to drive to meet them at and you do the exchange as you roll down your window. I&#039;ve been in the Midwest and East Coast though where I found myself buying China White in the fucking hood and it was GOOD and they always made me write down their pager numbers even though I wasn&#039;t even from there. ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lay low and stay safe everyone. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You too. Careful out there. :-X

Yeah just be observant and it&#039;ll be easy to figure out who&#039;s holding what. West coast the guys slinging H that you wanna get to know are almost always Mexicans and there are lots of gnats that will swarm around looking for someone to bring to him for a referral fix. If you go that route don&#039;t let them convince you to pay them too because they already get something out of it from the Guy. Otherwise they&#039;re playing games.<br /><br />But you shouldn&#039;t need a gnat if you&#039;re just observant. Good luck.
