				You need a PGP program.&nbsp; There are a few out there - I personally use Portable PGP.<br /><br />You need to download it, install it, and then you have to generate a new keypair.&nbsp; Type in an email (if you are going to receive encrypted email to an addy use that), then in the comment you can put in a username or whatever.&nbsp; Select how many characters (default it 1024 which is max on PortPGP - it&#039;s safe, even though some people will not go less than 2048). Next type in your passphrase (I recommend actually typing in a full sentence that you will be able to remember, as adding multiple words and spaces to a password make it exponentially more difficult to crack).<br /><br />It will generate a keypair and you can click on the &quot;keyring&quot; icon to show which keys you have.&nbsp; You should only have your newly created keys and the keys of the developers of the program (they come with it on installation - you can delete them if you like).<br /><br />The top section is the Private PGP Key section.&nbsp; Do not use this, do not give this to people.&nbsp; In the bottom section is the Public PGP Keys section.&nbsp; Your email/username will be there also.&nbsp; if you click that you can then click the icon right above it with the floppy disk icon.&nbsp; This will open up a &quot;save as&quot; window.&nbsp; Just save this to your desktop, and then minimze the program and right-click the newly created file.&nbsp; Click &quot;open with&quot; and choose Notepad.&nbsp; Inside you will have your newly created public key.&nbsp; Copy and paste it (be sure start at the &quot;---&quot; at the top left and end at the &quot;---&quot; bottom right after &quot;end of PGP key&quot;.<br /><br />This is your public key.&nbsp; You can open this file any time and paste this into a message to give users your public key so they can send encrypted messages to you, which can only be opened with the pass-phrase you entered when creating it.<br /><br />You can import other people&#039;s public keys into the program as well.&nbsp; Go to the message where their public key is located.&nbsp; Select the public key from top-left --- to bottom-right ---.&nbsp; Copy it, open up notepad and paste it in.&nbsp; I usually save it under that person&#039;s username until I have imported it. Save this to your desktop.&nbsp; Go to PortPGP and click the icon with the arrow on it right above the public key section.&nbsp; This will open an &quot;open&quot; window.&nbsp; Select the file you just saved with the person&#039;s username and it will automatically import into the program and show up in your public key section.<br /><br />The next part is easy.&nbsp; Click the &quot;encrypt&quot; tab on the side.&nbsp; You will have two options - you can either encrypt a file or ASCII text.&nbsp; it should default to text but if not click that little bubble.&nbsp; Type your message in there.&nbsp; If the person doesn&#039;t already have your public key, paste it into the message after your text as well, so they can encrypt back to you.<br /><br />At the bottom of the text window there are two dropdown bars.&nbsp; One says &quot;target&quot;.&nbsp; Make sure you click that and select the person you want to actually send it to, or else you will encrypt it to the wrong person and your intended recipient won&#039;t be able to open the message.&nbsp; Under that it gives you the option to sign it.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to if you don&#039;t want to, just leave it as &quot;encrypt only&quot;.<br /><br />Once you click encrypt, you will see an encrypted message that looks like this:<br /><br />--- Start PGP Message ----<br /><br />;klafds78fnafs78fs08fyhgahgdsygs7692hjnadnhgd;a7 74afhu18y (and so on)<br /><br />--- End PGP Message ---<br /><br />Click &quot;copy to clipboard&quot;.&nbsp; Go to the message you are sending in SR or on the forums or your email or whatever, and paste the message there.&nbsp; Then click send.&nbsp; Your recipient will be able to enter their keypass to decrypt the message and read what you wrote, and then use your public key to send back to you.<br /><br />You will get a message back that looks similar to the above message (usually many lines longer of random characters).<br /><br />Select it from starting &quot;---&quot; to ending &quot;---&quot;, then copy it.&nbsp; Go to PortPGP and click the &quot;Decrypt&quot; tab.&nbsp; Again you have the option of a file or ASCII text.&nbsp; Make sure the text bubble is selected.&nbsp; Paste the encrypted message into the text window, and click &quot;decrypt&quot; on the bottom right.&nbsp; A password request window will pop up and here you enter your pass-phrase you first put in to create your public and private keypair.&nbsp; If you get the pass-phrase right, it will open a window with the text in it.<br /><br />Voila!&nbsp; You have encrypted and sent a message, and received and decrypted a message back to you.<br /><br />I do this to be helpful, but also so that if you are ever in the market for fantastic organics, you will go here first:<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/7181<br /><br />Cheers!&nbsp; P.S. my pgp key for PM is in that link as well.<br />

				Sorry, forgot to mention one other thing.&nbsp; Unless you have your normal windows user set up as admin (hopefully not), right click the program to open it and click &quot;run as administrator&quot; then enter this password.&nbsp; This applies in Win7 and I think Vista.

				For anyone who has a hard time understanding PGP, as did I, here is a short explanation:<br /><br />You write a message, and then encrypt it with the receivers public pgp. What this means is that the only people who can read the message, are the people who have the private key and password for the publig pgp in which you encrypted the message for (a public pgp is a pair, and the person with the other part, the private key, and the appropriate password for the private key, can unlock the message).<br /><br />You include your public pgp in the message, so the receiver can do the exact same thing back to you - encrypt it so that you and you only, can read the message (by unlocking it with the private key part of your pair and appropriate password).<br /><br />This sounds stupidly obvious I know, but I had a hard time understanding this until recently :)<br /><br />Here is a postal analogy from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#A_postal_analogy
