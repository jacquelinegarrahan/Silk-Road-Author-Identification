				First, I realize I&#039;m a dumbass. I tried to switch from using Dwolla&gt;Mt Gox&gt;SR and funded VirWox with Paypal. Then they tell me I need to &quot;teleport&quot; to one of their things to validate my avatar. WTF? When I click on any one of those sites, it just sits there and nothing happens....I left it up thinking it would just take a while.<br /><br />When I went back to the request I had made to transfer the BTC I had request to send to SR it said it&#039;s waiting for a &quot;manual&quot; check since I made it with Paypal.<br /><br />WTF someone please help/and/or PM me.<br /><br />Thanks

				Sorry I can&#039;t help you on this one: I figured somebody on here would know something...like I&#039;d told you, I just go from dwolla to TradeHill to wallet, then here there everywhere...<br /><br />You&#039;ve probably already seen the btc wiki on it, but they are always the easiest to follow, for me, with btc in any area:<br />Hop on your regular browser, if you want, and trot over to:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/VirWoX

				Hey Happytree,<br /><br />There is a big WARNING in the purchasing module over on the SR marketplace site that says the VirWox transfers can take up to 48 hours to clear and since your incoming BTC address issued by SR is only good for 12 hours, sending transfers from them doesn&#039;t work out too good. ;)<br /><br />We can discuss this if/when you contact me about the VortexMilkMan &quot;gotcha&quot; on the feedback thing.&nbsp; If you want.&nbsp; :D

				I know, I&#039;m so pissed. AND, my funds have already been transferred from PayPal, so they&#039;re now in BTC form, in Virwox. THe support email comes back and says I don&#039;t have to have my avatar validated or some shit.<br /><br />BUT, the actual &quot;Status&quot; i get when I look at my pending transfer to SR&#039;s BTC address is: Your withdrawal request has been received. However, a manual step is required before it can be completed. More information can be found here (and the &quot;here&quot;) corresponds with a link that reads this: <br /><br />&quot;Withdrawals to bank accounts are usually processed on the morning of the next business day. While most withdrawals to PayPal, NETELLER, Moneybookers, and Bitcoin accounts are processed instantly, we manually check some of them for security reasons. They will be processed within 48 hours. In any case, you will receive an email confirmation when the withdrawal has been processed&quot;<br /><br />So, bascially they&#039;re going to try and fund the BTC address I gave them for SR&lt; and it&#039;s not going to be valid anymore. SO THEN wtf will happen? <br /><br />ARRRRRRRRRGH I AM SO MAD! And to think I thought this would speed up the process from Dwolla to MT GOx to SR<br />

				I had that happen once from a Paypal account....it was a while ago, and I didn&#039;t know any better, and sent btc direct from seller to SR.&nbsp; I had a special order, and I needed the btc ASAP ... but they took over a day, and I&#039;d missed the 12hr cutoff. Everything on SR seemed to be disappeared.&nbsp; &nbsp;I figured they were just lost, shame on me, and I was pissed...but I notified SR, and damn if they didn&#039;t fix it...so don&#039;t despair.&nbsp;

				Yeah, it&#039;s all good now. Virwox cancelled that transfer; and I gave them a different E-wallet address that won&#039;t expire.<br /><br />Baby steps, baby steps!

				I still use virwox when in a pinch and need it in a hurry but it really isn&#039;t worth it. They only let you trade whole bitcoins so you end up with money left over, or those stupid worthless lindens. And they aren&#039;t that fast with that &quot;manual&quot; step.<br /><br />In a hurry there are a couple places that take money gram or western union.<br /><br />thsi site took 24 hours and has pgp key&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinexchange.cc/faq.html#question1&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This site takes like 6 hours https://bitcoinbux.com/index.php/the-xchange<br /><br />The MG/WU fee sucks but it&#039;s not that much more than virwox, and it&#039;s much faster and easier.

				Thanks Getliquid. Funny, I wrote them a nasty gram, telling them how their fees were pretty insane, the whole fraction/bitcoin thing, etc, etc. The guy writes back and says he&#039;s refunded the fees which I was charged but I need to &quot;inform&quot; and &quot;educate&quot; myself before using&nbsp; them. How ironic, they&#039;ve refunded fees back into currencies which a) I can&#039;t do anything with, b) I can&#039;t transfer out or I&#039;ll get charged again c) put into Bitcoins because it&#039;s not a full bitcoin. Ohhhh the irony.<br /><br />LOL<br /><br />I will check your recommends. Mucho gracias.

				I know this thread is WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYm old, but i stumbled across it while using the forum search for m<br />virWox.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t mind using them whenever I want to load some BTC with a credit card.&nbsp; I mean they do charge a fee (last time i used them my daily limit was 260$/day and 2600/mo.&nbsp; When I loaded 260$ for the day (with a credid card) I still got 250$ return after my 260$ deposit.&nbsp; To me that is a very reasonable commision.&nbsp; But that also has to do with how often you use them, and what your account level is at (I remember it was about 20% when I started).&nbsp; But when you really need BTC and your credit card is the only was you have of funding it at the time.. well your options are limited ya know lol.<br /><br />t<br />he only problem I am having with them right now, is that I can&#039;t seem to get the webpage to load,,, AT ALL. So that really sucks considering I am in desperate need of getting some BTC funded because I am going out of town this weekend, and would really hate to be withdrawing the entire vacation.<br /><br />-AA<br /><br />PS:&nbsp; The whole &quot;manual step&quot; that takes a few days to get your BTC moved goes away pretty quickly as long as you are using the same method for deposit consistntly.&nbsp; And once that goes away it takes about 2 hours to have your SR account funded..... not too shabby.
