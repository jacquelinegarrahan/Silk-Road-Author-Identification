				Never attribute malice to that which can be explained by incompetence.<br /><br />The likely explanation is that some vendors don&#039;t know they can peg the product price to USD.

				Most vendors peg their prices. If they didn&#039;t they would either price themselves out of the market to wide or to narrow.

This is all my theory though, it&#039;s based on nothing.

				Who knows why its increasing but it probably has a lot to do with hoarding. I think there is a lot more incentive to scam from the vendor side while the price is rising so quickly too. Its a pretty shit characteristic of a &#039;currency&#039; to be so volatile. Currencies need to be stable to have real worth as an exchange. At the moment bitcoin is failing in that respect.

				just checked btc prices again, and yet again they have jumped overnight by half a dollar (30p).<br /><br />may not sound like much but even that 30p is going to add 50 quid to my intended next order.<br /><br />total price has gone down by 0.3 bitcoin. WOW.<br /><br />i hope SR sorts this, I can imagine a lot of custom being lost. i wont pay 750 for something that was 500 3 weeks ago.

				The exchange rate of bitcoins has nothing to do with mining difficulty. It is based on supply and demand. On trading platforms like MtGox, people post buy and sell orders at various prices. Let&#039;s say that BTC are currently trading for 15 USD. If a bunch of buy orders come in, then all the BTC at 15 USD will be bought up, so the next buyers will have to get BTC that are posted for 15.50 USD, then 16 USD and so on.<br /><br />Conversely, if more people are trying to sell BTC than buy them, then sellers will have to post orders at decreasing prices in USD to get them sold (they are in effect competing to sell their BTC, so naturally the price will go down).<br /><br />Take a look at http://mtgoxlive.com/orders<br /><br />The diagonal lines indicate how many BTC will have to be bought or sold to move the exchange rate to that point. You&#039;ll notice some vertical jumps around the whole dollar marks. That&#039;s human psychology at work in the market. People are more likely to post a sell order at a round number like 20 USD, although plenty of people post sell orders at intermediate prices.<br /><br />Based on all buy and sell orders, they know exactly how much BTC will have to be bought (or how much USD will have to be &quot;bought&quot; by selling BTC) in order to move the exchange rate to any point.<br /><br />

				Bitcoin is easy to manipulate as there&#039;s no regulation and transactions are essentially free. Pump and Dump is a possibility, especially if the stats that say the vast majority of BTC is horded, that means there is a much smaller amount of liquid BTC which makes manipulation easier. I hope that&#039;s not the case, I would much rather the reason for the rise be that the mining reward was halved a short time ago.

				Bitcoin is more of a product then a currency it&#039;s easily manipulated and is a simple supply and demand. Flood the market with bitcoins price goes down, not enough bitcoins price goes up.

Several major websites have started taking bitcoin as payment (Wordpress, Reddit, hosting.co.uk)<br />3. Recent articles on zerohedge, forbes, and others explaining bitcoins success, and it&#039;s threat to the central banking infrastructure<br />4. Obviously speculation is a big one as well. A lot of big players have resurfaced to start trading again as the price keeps going up.
