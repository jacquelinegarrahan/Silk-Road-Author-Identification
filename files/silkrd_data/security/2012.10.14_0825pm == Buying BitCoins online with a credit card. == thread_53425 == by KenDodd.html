				<br />Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking for a while, researching the entire process before making my first purchase. One of the missing bits of info in my chain is how to buy BTCs - purely online - using a credit card i.e. without getting cash out etc.<br /><br />Any tips really appreciated.<br /><br />Ken

				well you buy it at some exchange like mtgox.com with your credit card but you dont use tor otherwise you get busted. then you deposit it into a bitcoin wallet like instawallet and you dont use tor for that either.. . then you have to start anonymise your process. put it into another instawallet that you only use via TOR services . then stick it through a bitcoin fog to another instal-wallet.. fater that you can stick it in your silk road wallet. i would not be using anythhing less than a bitcoin fog and mulitple wallets if you are intending to use a credit card<br /><br />there are plenty of guides how to do this on the forums.<br /><br /><br />most importantly dont be buying coins with a credit card in the hope it will be in your SR wallet within the same day - its asking for trouble... to anonymous those coins you need to use fog services and move stuff arfound.. spend a week or two doing this... move it around... use the fog services.. no rushing.

				without knowing country it hard for people to steer you in the right direction but most are gonna tell you to get off your ass and go out of the house to buy bitcoins. online is easy just not secure without giving alot of information that you might not want tied to you. Buying bitcoins is not a crime that doesn&#039;t mean people wont be curious to what you are doing with them.

				I was where year are last week. Don&#039;t leave a paper trail to bit coins. Bit instant via bank transfer. It&#039;s extremely easy, fast, and anonymous. I had my cheddar in about an hour after the deposit. All I had to do was complete a deposit slip. 8)

				<br />Hi all, <br /><br />Sweetbro, thanks for the advice. I&#039;m aware of tumbling the coins through a few accounts - I didn&#039;t realise it should be moved around for a week or two but I&#039;m in no rush - I just wanted to know how to buy the BTCs in the first place. If I can&#039;t get on mtgox through Tor, can I just go to a public wifi hotspot, route through a proxy and do it that way? <br /><br />I know some people use their real identity to buy coins and then fog the coin trail between their purchase and the SR, but my credit cards are already not traceable to me so I just want to avoid identifying myself to mtgox in any way.<br /><br />WSG and Deco, thanks for the advice but my disabilities mean I can&#039;t &quot;get off my ass and go out of the house&quot; which is why I asked about how to do it purely online. I&#039;m in the UK but I assumed it wouldn&#039;t make any difference if I do it all on the internet.

				One other thing: last time I looked, you cannot add to your MTGOX account using a credit card. Has this changed now? There&#039;s still no mention of credit cards on the site&#039;s help section.
