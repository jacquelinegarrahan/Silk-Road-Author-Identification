There is one other transaction in the referenced account, for 17.24btc which entered 5/22/13 and is transferred out 5/28/13 - It moves through one intermediary account, is then combined into a block of 200btc and moves through an account that transacts only in 100 or 200btc blocks totaling 10,100btc. Following any one of those 200btc blocks leads you to apparent “mixer” transactions, small amounts of value peeling off of the larger amount at each hop. Taint analysis reveals that nearly 10% of those bitcoins eventually pass through an address responsible for transacting more than 419,000btc since 2012<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It is concerning a bit now without knowing more details.<br /><br />I see two aspects to this.<br /><br />First, for vendors, if they are withdrawing the coins in any way that is traceable to them it would make it very easy for any unsuspecting vendor who gets coins that coincidentally were deposited into SR via LEO to get caught up.&nbsp; Hopefully most vendors are taking proper precautions but surely some are taking the easy route and hoping the mixer is protecting them.<br /><br />If they are tracing coins withdrawn by LEO using fake vendor accounts via SR after going through its mixing process back to their initial creation or deposit they could be traced to all sorts of different people who might&#039;ve not properly concealed their identities when making the initial deposits.&nbsp; If you did properly conceal your identity when obtaining the coins in the first place it should still protect you as a buyer.&nbsp; But, if not, even if you&#039;ve already completed your transactions this could maybe come back to bite someone.<br /><br />Need more information to determine what is going on here.

				Has nothing to do with washing your coins, DEA made a vendor account and went from there...used the term &quot;honey pot&quot; probably charged alot less for product and people jumped on it, waiting for a big buyer somewhat close to where there operation was being held and went from there.

				Posted this in the other thread of the same topic, but this appears to be a vendor. His nickname was, &quot;Casey Jones&quot; and that is a SR vendor who is in stealth.

The vendors profile I mentioned above is also &quot;Casey Jones&quot; and that vendor is in stealth so there is a good chance that the DEA is referring to that vendor. Also, that information about the seizure is posted on a government site so it should be authentic.

				His coins (assuming the same Casey Jones) were seized April 12, and he has feedback from 29, 18, and 16 days ago? <br /><br />The (a) forum user that is associated with the vendor page was last online in late May.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=24461<br /><br />That seems maybe concerning.

				This Casey Jones requested a sample from me a 15 days ago. The crazy thing is, he messaged me from his vendor account, and willingly gave me his entire personal address, not a drop address. I myself warned Casey at the time to be careful because anyone at anytime could blackmail him, and he pretty much dismissed the idea and said &quot;no problem, I might start a alternate buyer account to start buying. I&#039;m not worried about it&quot;

				And just to thicken the plot: State of South Carolina court records show that an Eric Daniel Hughes is facing drug charges for the distribution of Clonazepam, and that he&#039;s now out on a $10,000 bond. Must be the guy:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=24461<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how the case relates to the DEA seizure, though, as it looks as though his arrest was on June 06 of this year, months after the April event.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I&#039;m curious about is *how* the Bitcoin were seized. If they&#039;d grabbed his computer, it wouldn&#039;t have been easy for him to keep vending (which he obviously did do), and even if they just seized a stored wallet, wouldn&#039;t they have taken the Bitcoin from the entire wallet, not just from one transaction? It would be like them busting a dealer with $5,000 in cash on him, but seizing only the $1,000 used in the deal they caught him with. It seems more likely the coins were handed over as part of a transaction.

				Thanks for posting. This is historic! First time BTC seizure and all.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Possibilities:<br /><br />-the guy was a buyer who FEd to a LE compromised account then got burned<br />-the guy was a vendor who got burned by not being cautious enough and being overall really stupid<br />-the guy was a vendor who had a wallet address that was compromised or outright hacked by LE<br />-the guy was a vendor who willingly gave up his wallet address login and pass after being threatened by LE<br /><br />If he was a vendor then it could be a combination of these. Either way I think he was really sloppy and probably did shit that was in clearnet, trackable and maybe even had Facebook and other accounts that could be linked back to SR. There&#039;s a thread on here which shows that this is (hopefully WAS) the case with some vendors. No shit. Some people really ARE that stupid if you can believe it.<br /><br />LE took a couple of months to build a case against this guy, then pulled the trigger and arrested him and charged him. I&#039;m thinking he probably couldn&#039;t keep his mouth shut when first approached by LE. Maybe even got his computer seized. I guess we won&#039;t ever find out unless that FOIA request ever gets answered.<br /><br />The moral of the story? Don&#039;t FE, don&#039;t be stupid, cover your ass and don&#039;t talk to police.

				It does seem a little funny they would make a big deal out of something going down for around USD$1000.<br /><br />I think the federal gov&#039;t agencies are under quite a bit of pressure to &#039;crack&#039; SR and similar sites. They must just absolutely hate that it can go on right under their noses. So I would expect only bolder and more brazen attempts will be made to infiltrate/bring down whatever they can, whether or not all their methods are legal. I have no idea how SR is hosted but I would guess the servers are not in the U.S. anyway, it would only make sense they be in some country with more favorable Internet and IP laws.

So many people think that just because they are LE that they have to follow rules. Well they really don&#039;t. They, like so many of us here, just have to not get caught breaking them. and if caught better have some kind of back up plan. <br /><br />They start their madness usually small and with little knowledge, and they learn, copy and excel to drive us out or deeper into the darkness.<br /><br />Let us not forget the Fear Factor of the negative publicity that people are being arrested. It won&#039;t take long before everybody will say they knew somebody that was taken down while traveling on the road.&nbsp; Advertising works, and what they are advertising is Prison. <br /><br />I understand they have rules to follow and laws to abide by but the truth is they will and do whatever it takes. Especially when Politicians are yelling how bad things are and it is to save the children.&nbsp; Even though the children will be running a much bigger and better road than before. Like the MFn Autobahn compared to a dirt road.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to keep things like this open for debate because it causes people to think creatively and realistically to stay safe and not believe that the other side is playing by the rules they&#039;ve set up. Remember, the people that are out in the field are not the one&#039;s that made the rules. But, they spend a great deal of their time trying to come up with ways around them and still get the desired results.&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; :)

For the most part, though, law enforcement is interested in winning cases more than it is just arresting people, and it would be self-defeating if they were to do something - such as engage in obvious entrapment - that would compromise a potentially major case. (Of course, just as there are those on the criminal side who don&#039;t make the brightest decisions, there are those on the side of the law who act foolishly, too.) So no - it&#039;s never simple! <br />

				Well said. My point was that LE has to build a case against a suspect and entrapping that suspect isn&#039;t the way to do it. It isn&#039;t as simple as busting a hooker. Even if LE lies they still have to establish that the drugs were sought by the suspect and paid for as well. That&#039;s why SR is such a problem for LE when trying to bust anyone who isn&#039;t on crack when placing an order. They need to prove intent to purchase which they&#039;ll get as soon as an order is placed. But they also need to trace payment. And don&#039;t forget identity either. Problem is they have to prove that the SR account holder is the same person who&#039;s receiving the drugs or that there&#039;s a connection between the two. Very very hard to prove unless someone opens their big mouth under pressure. The payment is the worst part. Bitcoin is a total nightmare for LE since they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that payment was made for the drugs. If they can&#039;t do that then chances are the suspect will walk if they have a decent lawyer.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176347.msg1275397#msg1275397">Quote from: hoobydoobydoo on June 26, 2013, 03:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176347.msg1273702#msg1273702">Quote from: Juggernog on June 25, 2013, 06:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">So how do you explain undercover sales and busts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Most undercover sales and busts involve LE buying from someone and then busting.<br /><br />The times where LE is selling drugs and busting the buyers are always done in person.&nbsp; Almost all of the time the drugs are fake and even when they are not LE arrests them immediately afterwards so they aren&#039;t actually letting drugs leave their possession.&nbsp; This would be equivalent to a CD when mailing drugs.&nbsp; In a CD they have the house surrounded and prevent all chance of the drugs leaving - and even then in most cases they remove the drugs and replace them with something that looks similar.<br /><br />Mailing out drugs to people just to build cred on SR is not an option in their playbook under the law.&nbsp; However, after the fast and furious scandal under Eric Holder and all of the other laws the US has been blatantly breaking lately to achieve their agendas I suppose nothing is out of the question anymore.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				There are many, even high profile cases where undercover LE agents have sold drugs and weapons. (in the 80&#039;s the CIA imported coke, distributed it and taught dealers how to make crack out of it, creating a problem that didn&#039;t even exist before that point, also and related is Iran Contra)<br /><br />Anyone who thinks they can&#039;t is just kidding themselves.&nbsp; They do the arrests, write the reports and provide the evidence.&nbsp; There is no overbody of police enforcement that goes through all of their casework to make certain it is done right.&nbsp; &nbsp;Internal affairs only investigates reported claims of police corruption, they do not hunt through paperwork for possible issues.<br /><br />Realistically, the guy was probably caught making a bad buy using his vendor account, or was nabbed dropping off his packages.

If Casey is stupid enough to go around ordering shit from his vendor account, I can almost guarantee he did something like this.<br /><br />We know if he was arrested, they searched his house. They seized his computer, and i&#039;m sure the forensics team at the DEA jizzed everyplace when they discovered he had his mtgox username and password auto saved; remember, he was a fucking idiot.

				^^ Pretty entertaining read.

				Grab your tinfoil hats motherfuckers! I went back to reread my messages from Jones.<br /><br />The DEA arrested Casey Jones on April 12th, 2013. We know this to be fact.<br /><br />On June 8th, 2013 Jones requested a sample and sent me his entire address. After Jones stated he was not too concerned, I replied back &quot;people are crazy, just stay safe.&quot;<br /><br />His next reply, which I totally forget about said, &quot;Thanks!!! i&#039;m switching over to my other seller account today. again appreciate the concern.&quot;<br /><br />So either jones is requesting samples while out on bail, or..fuck.<br /><br />Other seller account?

				LE can distribute drugs and support criminal acts if they want to, it has been done thousands of times and the law supports it. It&#039;s a good and easy method to get evidence.<br />And the truth is the law does not even matter, they enforce the law and therefore they can do as they please.<br />They have massive resources available to take down this drug market, they can attack this drug marked in more ways then we can dream of.<br /><br />LE are reading what we write here, so don&#039;t expect that people involved in running SR will write anything about what they do with compromised accounts here.<br />If they have their eyes open they should be aware of this case.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure LE have more active accounts selling and buying right now.<br /><br />If we are really unlucky the whole site could be compromised already, and massive busts could be done within a few years whenever they feel ready.<br />It has been done before with many underground networks.

LE&#039;s been catching a lot of heat for not being able to stop SR. They&#039;re under pressure to bust someone. So who&#039;s it going to be?<br /><br />Obviously, the easiest one to bust. Casey Jones made it easy for them and he got busted. <br /><br />I think the lesson to be learned here is don&#039;t make it easy for them. Security in this game needs to be taken seriousy. <br /><br />I think the low-hanging-fruit analogy is approapriate here. Don&#039;t be the low hanging fruit.

I&#039;m sure minors make up a large percentage of sales here, but frankly I think it is a huge security hole and one a side of SR that brings a lot more attention than is needed. Each and every SR member has a responsibility to SR to: A. Never speak about SR to friends. Your friends are not your friends when facing distribution charges. B. Never speak about SR to law enforcement. C. Make every effort to hide SR use, so that it cannot be proved it was ever accessed. D. Make every effort to ensure that you will receive every package you order (vendor choices, secure drop points, never signing, etc.). and E. Do not ever, ever speak about SR.<br /><br />SR is fight club. You do not talk about Fight Club, and you certainly do not talk about SR.

My point was that LE has to build a case against a suspect and entrapping that suspect isn&#039;t the way to do it. It isn&#039;t as simple as busting a hooker.

That&#039;s why SR is such a problem for LE when trying to bust anyone who isn&#039;t on crack when placing an order. They need to prove intent to purchase which they&#039;ll get as soon as an order is placed. But they also need to trace payment. And don&#039;t forget identity either. Problem is they have to prove that the SR account holder is the same person who&#039;s receiving the drugs or that there&#039;s a connection between the two. Very very hard to prove unless someone opens their big mouth under pressure. The payment is the worst part. Bitcoin is a total nightmare for LE since they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that payment was made for the drugs.

				Thanks. Everything I said was strictly from a legal standpoint. At the same time I will admit in a second that LE regularly breaks the law SEVERELY to get what they want. As far as the DEA is concerned the ends always justify the means. If they figure that a suspect doesn&#039;t know the law, can be intimidated and can&#039;t afford a lawyer, they will do whatever it takes to fuck that person. Legal or illegal. But if the suspect DOES know the law and CAN afford a lawyer and DOES exercise their constitutional rights, then it&#039;s LE who&#039;s fucked. That&#039;s of course assuming that forfeited assets were returned after proof of money origin was provided.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that the US is a police state. A few years ago a mayor in Maryland had his door bashed down with a retroactive no-knock warrant. They tied him, his wife and her mother up, shot their two innocent dogs dead and fucked up their whole house. All over a 30 pound package of weed that was addressed to his house. A courier was later indicted on charges that he was the one who penciled in the mayor&#039;s name and address with the intent to intercept the package before it arrived.<br /><br />Every year many people are mistakenly shot dead by the DEA. Some are over 80 years old. LE always gets away with it because they have complete immunity. They will also lie and cover up at a moment&#039;s notice to protect their asses. The only defense against this shit is to know your rights, exercise those rights and have access to a good lawyer. Then sue the fuck out of them when all is said and done.

DEA can&#039;t send out drugs because that would be textbook entrapment. They can pay for product, but they can&#039;t sell it. They can pose as a vendor, but not actually provide any product. If a real honeypot is made here or somewhere else LE would need to create a number of fake transactions with fake feedback and fake transfers of bitcoins. Even then a buyer would have to be dumb enough to FE so that the bitcoins leave escrow. Otherwise there&#039;s no case against the buyer. No released payment, no case. If LE pays a buyer a visit then they would need the buyer to admit that they ordered the drugs. If that happens, then they have a case. Maybe a weak case, but one that could have legs if a search warrant is issued and other surveillance is used. That would only happen if the buyer was big enough to waste that much time on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So you are now contradicting this statement.&nbsp; But as you have proclaimed your speaking from a legal standpoint, who&#039;s?&nbsp; Whichever suits the need at the particular time you want to proclaim &quot;I&#039;m right&quot;.&nbsp; Wonderfully brilliant&nbsp; :o
