				You could check out JonDoNym, I don&#039;t know if you can select your country but it&#039;s a good alternative to TOR, except it&#039;s not free and not as many people use it.

				If some company controls the network of proxies, you are not anon. Even if you pay with bitcoins, you will connect with an IP address that could identify you. You could use Tor to connect to these &quot;elite proxies&quot;, but then why not just use Tor?<br /><br />If you need a non-exit IP, point the TorBrowser at a web proxy.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the site I use to find web proxies: http://www.publicproxyservers.com/proxy/list_country1.html

				ya I would use tor to connect to the elite proxy.<br /><br />The reason tor is not good for my purpose is I have no real control over the location I appear from.<br /><br />For my purpose, I need to be able to appear from as many locations as possible that I can choose and also via an elite proxy so that I am not detected as being on a proxy.

				It is possible to manually control your Tor exit node, and to select one in a country you would like to appear to be in. Of course, Tor exit nodes will be readily identifiable as such, you will probably have more luck with an Elite Proxy if you are trying to hide that you are using an anonymizing service from your destination. Unfortunately I can&#039;t suggest any proxy services to you, I have never been very concerned with hiding that I am using an anonymizer from the servers I connect to, and in the rare instances when I am concerned about it (ie: the site blocks them, or it triggers a fraud warning when purchasing a web server anonymously, etc) I simply use Tor to connect to an open web proxy. There are web proxies that come and go on almost a daily basis, and if you use one of those it is very unlikely to be identified as a proxy. Of course one of the stable long term web proxies is about as likely to be on a proxy blocklist as a stable Tor exit node is.
