				My friend was thinking of buying some BTC on ExchB. In the effort to trim the paper trail, he wanted to deposit to an account there via a postal money order (because it can be purchased with cash). If he decides to send the money order, should he use a fake or a real sender address on it? Does it even need to have a sender address to be accepted &amp; cashed?<br /><br />If he chooses a real address, would a money order paid (to a bitcoin exchange) from that address cause it to be &#039;watched&#039; for package traffic? What are the risks of faking/spoofing the return/sender address?<br /><br />Someone told MF that he should just use some random person&#039;s address from the phonebook.<br />SWIM said to use a trusted 3rd party only to send the money order. This 3rd party address would then be unsafe to ship to.<br /><br />Your 0.02 on best practices with money orders?

				I&#039;d go with SWIM&#039;s suggestion, personally.&nbsp; Including to NEVER ship anything there....&nbsp; You could also buy some Liberty Reserve and transfer over to the btc exchange site from there, or fund an anonymous gift CC and use that...
