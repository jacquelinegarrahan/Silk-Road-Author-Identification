				Alrighty, well to the first matter. I removed my usb that carries liberte OS and connected to another computer in my home in order to print an invoice. I plug my usb back in and boot in my normal computer. I then go on to the safe browser and put tormail in the url. Upon doing this, I get a page that says Hacked by 1923TurkGroup. Now naturally I freaked out, but I knew I didn&#039;t have any info that could be damaging except an invoice image that im no longer going to fulfill. All my passwords and usernames are on a tormail email sent to myself, along with a seperate email with my public and private key. So i got a new usb, and put a new liberte on that. Alas, when I went online with that OS, and entered tormail in the url, It said the same thing. Now I am worried. <br /><br />[NOTICE: I now have an idea why it says this, it might be because I am putting .com instead of .org&nbsp; ::). Could someone confirm this for me?]<br />[Also, if someone could review the above paragraph and tell me if im &quot;doing it right&quot;, i.e deleting keys and passwords off usb, backed up on email]<br /><br />Now for some more questions. When I go to the home directory I get two files, liberte and nofw. It denies me access to the nofw folder. I began thinking for some reason this may be the &quot;hacker&quot; but now I&#039;m just thinking it is normal. Am I correct?<br /><br />I have used my windows OS when I first was accessing SR, am I relatively safe? (haven&#039;t purchase anything yet) <br /><br />Last one, is there a way I can create a seperate SR account (not forum)? I&#039;ve tried to create different accounts but after I register it keeps saying &quot;login failed&quot;. Maybe i&#039;m just dumb, oh well at i am learning.<br /><br />Thanks for all the help, I am so excited that I have found out about these hidden services and I feel I have already learned so much in the past 3 days trying to configure my browser and OS for near total anonymity.<br /><br />

				You seem to have misunderstood my last question. I can login on my original account, I was just wondering if I could get a new one.<br />Thanks for the quick response though. that is a relief about the tormail. I figured that would be the case when I noticed it but I just needed someone to tell me that it was okay. And yeah thats the only reason I go there, because I don&#039;t want to write it the onion down or have it on my usb.<br /><br />It&#039;s safe to have bookmarks on my browser right?<br /><br />

				ive had a few weird moments that i put down to sheer coincidence.<br /><br />after i started using tor and sr, i had one or two things happen that made me think the universe has a sense of humour or someone has hacked my pc and&nbsp; is watching what i browse online.<br /><br />On a few occasions, id been researching a particular person, topic or something i cant remember. and when i finished that and opened a new site where i had to use those &#039;image/text verification&#039;,&nbsp; the word that popped up in the box , was exactly connected to what i had just spent the last few hours looking at. <br /><br />itd help if i could remember the exact word i saw, but for example, imagine id been browsing anything to do with the L.A Lakers and then following that, once im at a different unrelated site, the word that pops up in a randomly generated spam verification window, happens to say &quot; BRYANT1&quot;&nbsp; or i was looking at meth recipes all day and then later when at new site, the image verif:is &quot;RACEMIC&quot;.. :o<br /><br />i doubt ive been hacked. the universe is stranger than we can suppose i guess. i love weird coincidences!<br /><br />Ive always had mega weird synchronicity happen thru my life so i think its more of a tinfoilhat moment;-)
