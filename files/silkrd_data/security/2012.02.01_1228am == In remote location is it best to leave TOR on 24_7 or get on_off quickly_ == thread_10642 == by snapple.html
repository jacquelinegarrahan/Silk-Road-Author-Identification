				I live in a remote area where there are few fellow tor users, so from a security standpoint would it be better to leave the tor network connected non-stop or just log on multiple times a day and be as brief as possible?<br /><br />Does it even matter the length of time I&#039;m on the tor network?

				The bridge idea sounds pretty good, though I don&#039;t entirely understand Tor&#039;s terminology there, but I&#039;d think that the longer you&#039;ve had Tor running, the less likely it is that someone will be suspicious about why it&#039;s being used; you could just be running one of the nodes or whatever.

				So I&#039;ve finally got the bridge relays working properly in the vidalia console. I don&#039;t see any slowdown on the connection either.<br /><br />You think it&#039;s best to just keep the tor running 24/7 so it blends into the rest of the system more?

				using bridges is a good idea. anyway it doesn&#039;t matter if you leave Tor running or not. I would personally not leave Tor running when you are not using it, because if you do that it implies that you are leaving your computer running with encryption keys in memory while you are not present.

				I actually retract my statement. In some ways, It is better to leave Tor running in a remote location. <br /><br />It is better to leave it running because if there are not breaks of ~24 hours between Tor sessions, Tor can bootstrap at directory mirrors (of which there are hundreds) instead of directory authority servers (of which there are eight or so). This is good for membership concealment / usage concealment against an attacker who monitors the directory authority nodes. <br /><br />However if you leave Tor running when you are not using your computer it is a huge indication that you are not properly utilizing FDE. Your computer is vulnerable when it is booted up.<br /><br />So I guess the best answer is probably that you should use Tor enough so that it doesn&#039;t need to bootstrap at directory authority servers (your Tor client gets a list of directory mirrors from the directory authority servers the first time it bootstraps, but the Tor client considers the list stale after some fairly short period of time, I think 24 hours or so), but you shouldn&#039;t leave Tor running when you are not using it. Or you could just use a bridge and use Tor as much or as little as you want. <br /><br />Of course if you use TBB you also directly connect to directory authority servers every time you upgrade. The same may be true for the regular Tor client itself, I am not sure. Also you need to keep in mind that simply by monitoring the Tor download site an attacker can quickly get a list of all IP addresses that have downloaded Tor. Hopefully they are not doing this, with you being the only one who downloaded Tor in the remote location that you ship drugs from.

				Driving a certain type of truck doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that you are robbing banks but LE are still going to check DMV records to see who all owns that sort of truck in a certain area, if a certain type of truck is spotted at a bunch of bank robberies. You guys entirely miss the distinction between intelligence and concrete evidence. Intelligence narrows in on evidence and usually it isn&#039;t even brought up in court, although you can find examples of it in case studies. We should have an intelligence forum to post case studies in, for all types of crime (since the general techniques hold true between all sorts of crime, even if the implementation details change). <br /><br />Stop missing the forest for the trees.

				I would assume that most vendors are smart enough to put plenty of distance between the place where they access the Tor network &amp; where they mail their packages.&nbsp; In fact, I suspect that many of the more successful vendors utilize some sort of remailing system whereby their packages are taken a good distance before being dropped in the mail.&nbsp; People who have studied the barriers to anonymity in the Tor network understand that Tor users can be pinpointed just by analyzing their connection -- that&#039;s a known issue.
