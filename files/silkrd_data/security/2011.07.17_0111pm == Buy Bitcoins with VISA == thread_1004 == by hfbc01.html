Gox websites and see about sending a money order or cashier&#039;s check in USD there.&nbsp; <br />Not as secure as having so many intermediaries, but *wherever you are* the exchange rates are NOT favorable.<br />I&#039;m pretty sure you will also have a 5% &quot;cash advance&quot; fee on your card when your statement arrives.<br /><br />Your only two choices are A. lose 30%+ on every transaction or B. have less security by sending a USD denominated negotiable instrument to Mt. Gox or TradeHill.&nbsp;

				There is a way to buy bitcoins with a Visa. Put the card you want to use in your pay pal account as a source to draw funds (you may already have one on there). Then get signed up at bitmarket.eu. Through this site you can still buy bitcoins with paypal. When doing this, just select that you want the funds to come from your credit card and not your bank account or whatever other form of payment you have saved there. I have actually done it a bunch of times. I think bitmarket.eu is the only one that you can still use paypal to buy bitcoins. Only one i know of at least. NOTE* You have to get confirmed to do trading at bitmarket.eu which can take a day or two but it is really easy.

Then get approved for a Bitmarket.eu account.&nbsp; Not all sellers accept Paypal, but many do.&nbsp; Once approved, buy some bitcoins, after which you&#039;ll get instructions from the seller to chose the &quot;Send Money&quot; option on PayPal.&nbsp; All you need is the seller&#039;s email address to send funds.&nbsp; There&#039;s no need to mention bitcoins in the PayPal transaction (I seem to remember you select something like the &quot;Services Rendered&quot; or &quot;Send Funds To&quot; option).<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s worked for me.

				I wouldn&#039;t trust PayPal with anything having to do with BTC. That&#039;s where big LE would look for an ethical way in...<br /><br />How long before they realize this is a BTC site and all of the sudden you can&#039;t do it. Few hours?

				Like I said I have done it before, shit I just did it the other day. There is nothing illegal about buying bitcoins. Most people buy using their bank account so I am not sure what you are getting at btcfreedom.<br /><br />also @btcfreedom, when you pay with paypal on bitmarket.eu you just send the seller the money as a personal gift or select (other). That way it just looks like a transaction between 2 people, there is no mention of bitcoins anywhere in the paypal transaction. This is how they say to do it on bitmarket&#039;s website. I have probably bought bitcoins a dozen times with paypal and have never had a problem. IF people are interested in getting bitcoins this way it is definitely worth getting confirmed on bitmarkets site and doing what I described. The prices at bitmarket are usually a little higher then say tradehill or anywhere else but there is also no fee. The site is completely run on donations which I think is pretty cool.

I truly do hope it lasts for them, but I wouldn&#039;t use PayPal as the mediator ever. They can eat a bowl of hot dicks.

				Virwox accepts Paypal payments, which should be able to be made from a Visa card. You can then buy SLL, and trade those for BTC. I&#039;m not saying this is an efficient way to get BTC (I assume the fees you&#039;d get hit with along the way would be a bit painful) but it is an option for quickly getting BTC from PayPal.

				If your in the UK mate try out Britcoin.com cos that&#039;s a really easy way to get them,basically just make a tranfer online from your bank to them and once they have your money they buy the BC&#039;s for you.<br />&nbsp;Otherwise Bitmarket.Eu is the other one i use,another one where you can choose your payment,bank transfer&#039;s,International Wires,WU and you can even use paypal. You also set the price you wanna buy at,there&#039;s a few people on wanting to buy BC&#039;s for like $4 lol,good luck to them&nbsp; ::)

				You can use visa to send Western Union or Money Gram to get bitcoins. Bitcoinbux and Bitcoinexchange are two sites I&#039;ve used that method and it worked pretty quick. Fees are something like 6% plus you have to cover the WU/MG fees which sucks but that&#039;s the only realiable way to use a credit card. I guess you could use CC through paypal on virwox but that also has high fees and 48 hour turnaround time

				--Yes, you can buy bitcoins from sellers on Ebay. And when it asks you to pay, you can pay with Paypal or it gives you the option to pay outside of Paypal and use a credit card (visa). While they&#039;re one or sometimes .5 btc at a time, it&#039;s fast and convenient. Even though Ebay has your personal information, once you ask the seller to send your bitcoin to someplace like a Mt Gox BTC address, or a personal e-wallet, and then on to SR (all of those without requiring real names, the trace is pretty undetectable).<br /><br />--Paypal has NOT banned sale of bitcoins.<br /><br />--It&#039;s not illegal to buy/sell bitcoins so LE aren&#039;t going to be looking at PayPal for Bitcoin transactions. Thousands of companies use Bitcoins in transactions. LEs (at least the rumors are) look at PayPal for reocurring,&nbsp; high dollar transactions between private buyers (send money to so-and-so that isn&#039;t related to Ebay, and you call it a &quot;gift&quot; or some shit).<br /><br />
