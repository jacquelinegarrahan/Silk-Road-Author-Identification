				Is there a reliable tormail alternative out there? I&#039;m getting kind of tired of it being down. It really makes business difficult when you can only communicate half the time... or what feels like half the time.

				I found secure-mail.biz to be a nice tormail alternative. It&#039;s in clearnet but doesn&#039;t seem to bad (you can access it through tor). It&#039;s used by some anonymous developpers, like the developper of whonix, so i figure it&#039;s not that bad.<br />You only have like 50MB of free storage space though so there&#039;s that.

				Just use safe-mail.net and turn off IP checking so it doesn&#039;t keep logging you out through Tor. Very fast and anonymous if you use Tor.

Right now, we are seeing a phase change that is making things more difficult. But out of these new obstacles, something else should arise. New methods will appear that have not yet been conceived or planned for. If you think that banning drugs will make them go away. Then, banning bitcoins will make them disappear. But that&#039;s not how it works. I believe what would result is that they will become more precious and valuable, as demand will still exist but supply will be hard to come by. The system will evolve, and new methods will be used to circulate/acquire them.

				Lavabit.com works fine with tor you just cant set up a new account all the time using tor. Keep trying and It will let you though sometimes. <br />Or set up your lavabit account using VPN or from a public computer somewhere then you can access it anytime with tor.

				I lost my trust in tormail.&nbsp; You really can&#039;t tell if they&#039;re getting back, copied, raped or what.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m genuinely scared for my email in there.&nbsp; It&#039;s anonymous BUT it&#039;s not confidential by any means.<br />

				After doing a bit of reading, it looks like hushmail might be the best option. For anyone interested, this is a good read:<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING<br />https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/tutorial-how-create-anonymous-email-accounts

				Don&#039;t use hushmail unless you&#039;re making throwaway accounts or something. It&#039;s not much better than a regular free webmail service as they are known to cooperate with authorities. Most of the evidence being used to prosecute The Farmer&#039;s Market (TFM) leadership involves decrypted emails sent through hushmail.
