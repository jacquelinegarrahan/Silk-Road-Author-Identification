				Well it&#039;s 100% bootstrapped... You&#039;re connected to tor, how else would you be able to access an onion website anyways? Even if that hotspot eavesdrop they won&#039;t be able to know what you&#039;re up to :)

				Thats a normal load up. If your in a area w little or no connection it will take a bit longer to load tor up. But seeing as your 100% bootstrapped your safe to surf.

				They could have a restrictive firewall. You could try onion icon -&gt; Settings -&gt; My firewall only lets me connect to certain ports. It will already say 80,443 so go with that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165786.msg1174875#msg1174875">Quote from: windmillz on May 29, 2013, 02:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">[Notice] Your system clock just jumped 4083 seconds backward; assuming established circuits no longer work.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is your system clock wrong, or did it just update at that time?
