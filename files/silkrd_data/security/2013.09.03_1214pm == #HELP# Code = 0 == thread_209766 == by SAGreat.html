				It&#039;ll help others if you mention some additional information, such as your OS, what program you&#039;re using and if you used a CLI, the commands you typed in before you got the error message, etc...

				Make sure that when you copy a customer&#039;s encrypted message that you include all of the ---------- in the top and bottom lines. You just need to paste their message to the clipboard of your GPG software, click on Decrypt, enter your Private Key (pass phrase) and it should decrypt.

				Here is a tutorial from former member, Guru, which should help you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />This is a known issue with the standard build. What you want to do is install the latest nightly build, per the following instructions (originally written by Guru)<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X<br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5)<br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using<br />the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of<br />keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />============================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the<br />recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste<br />it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be<br />found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the<br />Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It<br />will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then<br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use<br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing<br />the encrypted message that was there previously.<br /><br />Good luck with it all. :)
