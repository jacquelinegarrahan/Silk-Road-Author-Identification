				And another one bites the dust! ::)<br /><br />They had a bitcoin debit card that you could shop anywhere that accepted debit cards.&nbsp; That had already shipped working debit cards to customers.&nbsp; It seems as though the debit cards are still working though.&nbsp; We shall see how this turns out...

				This is more fallout from the Liberty Reserve bust.&nbsp; eCardOne.com allowed you to load/exchange with LR as well. I think we are stepping on the toes of the global money mafia. They protect their territory pretty hard. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the full list of the sites brought down under that civil complaint...<br /><br />Wm-Center.com<br /><br />e-Naira.com<br /><br />EcardOne.com<br /><br />Ebuygold.com<br /><br />Getemoney.com<br /><br />Epaymonster.com<br /><br />Instandgoldng.com<br /><br />JTGold.com<br /><br />Goldnairexchange.com<br />Superchange.ru<br /><br />Webmoney.co.nz<br /><br />M-Gold.com<br /><br />Goldmediator.com<br /><br />Absolutexchange.eu<br /><br />ABC-Ex.net<br /><br />Nicciexchange.eu<br /><br />Alertexchanger.com<br /><br />Goldexpay.com<br /><br />Mewahgold.com<br />Centregold.ca<br /><br />Electrumx.com<br /><br />Tukarduid.com<br /><br />Entelnova.com<br /><br />Tacoauthorized.com<br /><br />Intexchange.com<br /><br />Ukrnetmoney.com<br /><br />Wmirk.com<br /><br />Nigeriangoldexchanger.com<br /><br />Edealspot.com<br /><br />Duyduychanger.com<br /><br />Magnetic-Exchange.com<br /><br />Moneyexchange.vn<br /><br />Exhere.com<br /><br />Velaexchange.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The scariest part to me is how many non .com domain names were seized. A lot of these were other countries. &quot;Umm excuse me, official US business, we need to confiscate this shit.&quot;<br /><br />
