				I am a new member to SR. I have already made a few successful purchases so I figured it was time to start a forum name and start chatting with other Silk Roaders. But I became fairly nervous once I realized that it says the IP of each post is recorded. What exactly does that mean and why is it done? Does this mean that LE can tell our IP address when we visit the Silk Road Forums? <br /><br />I thought Silk Road was supposed to be anonymous so why are our IP addresses being logged when we post? I would really appreciate any insight that anyone could give me regarding this issue. I doubt LE can track us from our IP but its just wierd that IP addresses are logged on the forum.

				Asbury can be a little too sharp in his comments sometimes. :)<br /><br />But he&#039;s right. You&#039;re accessing these forums through Tor. The entire point of Tor is that no site you access through it knows your actual IP. Instead, they get the IP of whoever happens to be your Tor Exit relay for that session. The IP being logged is not your own, and you can&#039;t be identified by it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re serious about this whole &quot;buying illegal stuff on the web&quot; business, you should really read up on what privacy measures you are or ought to be using. It&#039;s the only thing between you and a very harsh prison sentence, so you&#039;d better know about every single loophole and how to plug it.

				Thanks for your help Horizons. It means alot to me that you would take the time to give me a good answer as opposed to the previous poster. I will take your advice and read more about Tor and the security in place. I am new so I am still learning but I have been studying a good deal. But since I only recently created a forum handle I only recently discovered the whole your ip address is being logged thing that it says when I post. Thanks again.

				Tor hidden services record the local host IP address for every single user, as far as the web server cares we are all coming from 127.0.0.1 or some other internal IP address.
