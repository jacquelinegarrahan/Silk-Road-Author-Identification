So that could mean they stole the whole SR Wallet...<br /><br />I hope you fuckers used PGP because they gonna go through that database now...

				Yes - looking at the front page it looks like SR has been taken down. Which would be a great shame but great news for street corner drug dealers.<br /><br />Let us see where this goes. Good luck DPR - stay strong brother.

				HOLY FUCK!!! I just finally had started utilizing the wonderland that is/was SR and now THIS?? I&#039;m SO glad you guys in the forum convinced me to use PGP! I mean I&#039;m fairly sure even if I hadn&#039;t that they wouldn&#039;t be coming after me for my small purchases, but STILL. Wow this is a HUGE bummer, I had a few BTC on there and everything.<br /><br />What&#039;s crazy is I almost used clear text to get a sample the other day, but refused to do it until the vendor learned PGP. So glad I didn&#039;t... but to those who did, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re hitting the high rollers if anything, the ones who were buying large enough quantities to sell.<br /><br />This fucking sucks... I guess this will be good news to the other darkweb marketplaces like BMR and Sheep. Too bad all our BTC are probably gone now. Anyone use that backup BTC address in the options? I wonder if they&#039;re gonna get their BTC?<br /><br />My heart goes out to DPR. He&#039;s a martyr for us all.

FUCK. I hope you&#039;re wrong. In any case, I highly doubt they&#039;ll be wasting their resources/time cracking PGP on small-time orders. I&#039;m sure if they can, they&#039;ll be doing that with the bulk orders before they fuck with recreational users.

				i read on a few sources that they have taken images off the servers that date back to 2011 just months after the site opened, and had transaction data, vendor and buyer information , as well as PMs , so i dont know if that is all true but it sounds like alot of the information has been compromised and im sure they will have no issue cracking whatever codes necessary to take down as many others as possible, its a shame .....its sucks for DPR but in alot of instances he did this to himself unfortunately
