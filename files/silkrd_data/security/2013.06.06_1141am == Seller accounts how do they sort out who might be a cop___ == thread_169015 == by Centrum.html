				I was just curious to know what the requirements are to obtain such a account? And also what kind of checks or security mesures are in place to prevent LE from setting up seller accounts to bust people in stings??

				I don&#039;t think there is anything keeping LE from opening a seller account on SR - except the fact that cops are not allowed to sell dope... their own restrictions will keep them from the Road, not the Road itself... <br /><br />If you&#039;re afraid of cops having a SR sellers account I&#039;d suggest to buy your products from sellers abroad - I don&#039;t think this kind of information is spread from LE to Le in different countries.<br /><br />But do let me know if I&#039;m mistaking.

				Well, I don&#039;t think it would necessarily work...<br /><br />Let&#039;s say LE does open up a seller&#039;s account. And let&#039;s say that a buyer bought from the vendor. They couldn&#039;t charge the buyer with anything... The buyer could have absolutely nothing incriminating in his house so how could he be arrested? He could probably be charged with &quot;Conspiring to import/smuggle illicit drugs&quot; but that&#039;s about it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know the details nor extent of what the law can or cannot do, but I don&#039;t think they themselves can ship you drugs if you bought them. I&#039;m sure they could send you an imitation, but you wouldn&#039;t be charged with possession, now would you? Even if they included a small bit of drugs in the imitation and you received the package, then they just broke the law themselves since they, technically, completed a transaction.

				&nbsp;They can easily get an account. Assuming cops will not sell drugs seems like a mistake to me.<br /><br />I&#039;d guess they care less about small buyers and more about bulk buyers and vendors. So, new bulk sellers and any account that markets items or services to vendors seem real risky to me. <br /><br />As a vendor I assume some of my customers are cops. I just hope they are not on duty :-) and assume they might be.

				Ok state and federal police services CANNOT SELL drugs!! It&#039;s their job to take the shit off the streets!! HOWEVER it&#039;s the AGENCIES that have been known to sell drugs to fund their own black budgets. Money that can&#039;t come from the tax-payers dollars because there should be &quot;no tax without representation&quot;. Meaning that you should have something to see the money going towards such as the health system, school system, roads &amp; infrastructure etc!! The drugs are sold to fund top secret projects we&#039;re never allowed to know about. It&#039;s a big fucking game!! All this War on Drugs shit is a big fucking ruse. Look at where most of the world starting getting it&#039;s heroin supply from after the invasion of Afghanistan. Fucking Afghanistan! Where was it getting most if it&#039;s heroin before that? The Golden Triangle!! Co-incidentally right around the time we went to war in Vietnam!! It&#039;s a fucking big disgusting lie!!!&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />Look at Ricky Ross and his demise. The guy that he was buying his coke from was a Central American CIA puppet and all that crack money apparently went to funding the Contras in Nicaragua in the 80&#039;s. What you think this shit has stopped?&nbsp; Set up by the same guy we was scoring from and made scapegoat as the face of &quot;the crack epidemic&quot;.<br />That sure killed a couple of birds with the one stone!! They got to fund two sides of a war for their own interests, establish an on-going pipeline and monopoly and keep a whole race of people under the thumb &amp; knee-capping any chance of a revolution in a time just after the likes of Malcolm X and The Black Panther Party. <br /><br />Did you know that agencies like the NSA for best example work under legislation that states &quot;The agency cannot be held legally accountable for any section or sub-section of law that does not specifically state that law applies to the NSA&quot;. Translation - the law doesn&#039;t apply to us!! <br /><br />Cocaine is a hell of a drug! - Rick James (bitch!)..

I bet its illegal for a cop to hand over a firearm to a known gang member but, that&#039;s similar to what they did in Fast &amp; Furious.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Not to mention that it&#039;s inefficient to work in a top down manner, as a seller selling to small time buyers. SR is a big target, they want to take DPR down, they could care less about Joe Bag-Of Peanuts whos ooting his face every once in a while via SR dope.

It&#039;s definitely a grey area. I know from reading a few ex-drug squad officer&#039;s books that when a cop or agent has to pose undercover as a drug dealer before they&#039;re sent out deep cover their supervising officers and a magistrate (or judge depending on your country) issues a warrant for certain sections &amp; sub-sections of legislation&nbsp; to broken by the agent and his informants if the situation requires it. Meaning if they were obtained by other policing fraternities they would be arrested WITHOUT charges applied. <br /><br />Shit the NSA is literally immune to prosecution from any law that does not specifically mention the NSA in that particular law!!! Literally a lawless agency!! Who doesn&#039;t find that scary? ???

				We were just talking in another thread about vendor accounts changing hands and how this could be a way for LE to obtain a vendor account with a reputation as legit. <br /><br />But either way, I&#039;m not sure placing an order does anything but put you on a list, because there&#039;s no way of proving that the person who placed the order is the person listed as the recipient of that order. If you&#039;re on some kind of list already (either for priors, probation, parole, or at the other end of things, high security clearance) then this alone could be bad for you. But otherwise, they&#039;re gonna have to take the next step and that, I think, means a CD. Otherwise it&#039;s a love letter.
