				I&#039;m moving out of the US soon. I have to travel through DFW and LAX. Is it reasonably safe to stow ~2g MDMA in checked luggage?

				I suggest mailing it to the house you are moving to. I mean it should be fine..but its riskier than just mailing it.

				I wouldn&#039;t do that.<br /><br />TSA will hang you by the balls if they catch you.<br /><br />Simply not worth the risk.

				Personally, I&#039;d rather pack it in my carry-on - capsule it up in some vitamin capsules and store it in a bottle with some real vitamins.&nbsp; It&#039;s not going to show up as anything suspicious on the X-ray scanner, and as long as you don&#039;t set off the metal detector, you&#039;re not going to have to worry about TSA going through your backpack.&nbsp; Even if they do a bag check, they&#039;re not going to open your vitamin bottle and look at every single capsule.<br /><br />Of course, you didn&#039;t say where you&#039;re moving to - the customs inspectors on the other end might be a different matter - but they&#039;re going to have a chance, if they want to, to look through your shit regardless of if it&#039;s carry-on or checked.

				OK, taking in luggage sounds a little too risky for me. Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it.

If you&#039;re moving, your ticket is one way, is that right? No worries, I am sure there are millions every day that fit that exact description.

				Mail it. Otherwise, up da butt, or down the hatch, then out da butt, or vomited. Mail it.

				F104, I gave that some thought. It definitely narrows it down, but not enough to be useful.<br /><br />Looks like I&#039;ll be mailing it ahead. Thanks everyone.
