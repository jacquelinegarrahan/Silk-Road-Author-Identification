				Im paranoid and feel the need to statistically calculate the chance of any contact with &quot;The MAN&quot;&nbsp; will update precentage of being contacted by any LE Agency<br /><br />If you have had contact please elaborate on what went down but not enough so &quot;The MAN&quot; could ID <br /><br />Remember to wear your tin hat and cloak of invisability whilst on the road.

				This poll is misleading because if you:<br /><br />A) Got the dreaded Knock and talk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />or <br /><br />B) Full gloved up and bent over.<br /><br />Then I doubt you&#039;d be a situation to answer on this poll, unless you&#039;re in a jail that contains an internet cafe.

				There are enough people on the forums that report being in trouble with LE. Some get lucky and only get a notification that the package contents were illegal and as a result were confiscated. Others get the package and within some time police knock on their door with a search-warrant. The time can range from minutes to even days or months. But there are also cases discussed on the forum where people get raided by the cops instead of the package arriving. This even happened to someone who only ordered 1gram of MDMA. <br />What you should not do is have multiple orders in transit. If they intercept one order they are alerted and watching the mail to that address. When they have 2 packages, possibly from other senders/location it gets way more difficult to claim you are not involved/order them yourself. <br /><br />&quot;A friend of mine used Silk Road like I did, and yesterday at around 11pm his house was raided by the police. This is UK by the way.<br /><br />Specifically he was found with a lot of wraps of MDMA (his fault, honestly), and had a missing order of pills from Aakoven.&quot; 4 grams MDMA<br /><br />&quot;I also know of a first hand IRL experience of a raid by federal agents done because of a raiding of aakovens packaging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Order was for 100x pills. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;I dont want to go into detail.<br /><br />ordered...<br /><br />Federal agents busted in.<br /><br />They waved wire transfers in my face<br /><br />Asked if i ordered anything from the internet.<br /><br />Arrested me on another drug they found<br /><br />Brought me down to federal custody<br /><br />Dropped the mail chargers because they didnt have enough evidence &quot;<br /><br />People do, sometimes, get busted!!<br />

				Anyone in the u.s experience any types of bust.., Would leo/usps let you keep receiving packages if they knew there was something illegal about that package or suspected something, even tho they still let you keep receiving them with all your contents untouched-inside and outside?&nbsp;

				^ I believe ithasbegun&#039;s post.<br /><br />BUT don&#039;t believe ANYONE at all. <br /><br />What is for sure - If you order ANYTHING illegal to a location, it is possible that&#039;<br /><br />1 - you get your drugs perfectly fine<br />2- your item gets lost or you somehow get scammed (rare)<br />3- you get a letter from customs. Your address is now possibly flagged<br />4- you get a knock from police with a search warrant and possibly get arrested. Get charged with anything they find in the search. <br />5- ???????????<br />
