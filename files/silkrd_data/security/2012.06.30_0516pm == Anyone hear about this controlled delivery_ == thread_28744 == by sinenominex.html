				Someone narcd them out. End of story.<br /><br />Same shit happened to rcs years ago with a guy that knew I was getting stuff in the mail(legal rcs). He got busted because his stupid ass was speeding with drugs. He got pulled over and it tested positive on the field test. Scared bitch narcd on me and so when a pack came(he didn&#039;t know about) they tried a control delivery. <br /><br />I denied everything. They didn&#039;t do shit because there is no proof. <br /><br />The best damn thing to do is shut the fuck up. Don&#039;t run your mouth to friends, family or anyone about where you get drugs. People in this world can&#039;t be trusted(majority of them) because they&#039;re so fucking envious of what others are doing.<br /><br />Sorry, had to vent.

				but as it is personal use they will just get a stern talking to right? Isn&#039;t that what everyone on SR is always saying? So why do they have 100 thousand dollar bails for such small amounts 0_0. It is almost like everyone who talks about how you will just get a love letter for less than fifty kilos of cocaine is fucking retarded??

				^True, but there is likely more to this case. For the most part, the only way LE is going to &quot;go easy on you&quot; is when the difficulty of making the heavier charges stick exceeds the resources they are alloted for such cases. In rural areas like Nebraska, that&#039;s wayyy less likely to happen than if they were in say, Chicago, NYC, or LA. The cops involved in this case, whether they are locals or feds, literally have nothing better to do. They probably received a tip from a CI (or perhaps whoever mailed them the LSD used contaminated packaging) and so knew what to look for. Once they busted these two, they pretty much ratted themselves out, thus eliminating any chance of leniency through ambiguity. Their bond is laughably high, but that doesn&#039;t mean their charges won&#039;t be greatly reduced as part of a plea bargain. If they don&#039;t have a record, odds are they won&#039;t get much time, if any. Not that probation (especially federal) doesn&#039;t suck.<br /><br />Bottom line is, the cops WILL absolutely rape you like this if they can. Don&#039;t give them the ammunition they need to put you away, even if it means you get let out with probation later. Some cases WILL be prosecuted to the fullest extent and there is always a chance that you&#039;ll get locked up for this bullshit. If you live in a rural area with strict drug laws, you have much more to worry about than someone in a liberal state--particularly in a big city with lots of drug use--who&#039;s only dealing in personal use amounts. Also, half a sheet of LSD is not what I would consider personal use for most people. They were probably going to split it with some friends, who were caught doing something else and ratted on them. Motherfuckers.

				False alerting is the norm in the police force.<br /><br />They know it.<br /><br />If they&#039;re suspicious of you, they&#039;ll just say the dog alerted, and search you. Who will the courts believe, you or them? <br /><br />

				When ever a human is involved eventually you will have human error. There is no way around it.&nbsp; Eventually the ticket will come up and out of the thousands and thousands of&nbsp; packages and&nbsp; envelops&nbsp; shipped&nbsp; &nbsp;there is going to come a time when one got&nbsp; scrapped against something and got cut open accidentally or just&nbsp; &nbsp;came open on it&#039;s own&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; faulty packaging or&nbsp; any other number of scenarios that can and have occurred and&nbsp; WILL happen again. There is just no way around it. No one can be perfect at all times. <br /><br />6+6 = 12&nbsp; even on krypton. <br /><br />These oils spills occur and all the sudden the news and politicians&nbsp; start talking about&nbsp; &quot;should of done this and should have done that&quot; or &quot;this precaution should have been in place&nbsp; etc..etc&quot;&nbsp; In hind-site&nbsp; &nbsp;you can&nbsp; no what number to bet on roulette too cause you have the information/intelligence to&nbsp; base your&nbsp; logic on&nbsp; but&nbsp; humans can not see the future&nbsp; nor predict what and when an accident might happen. No matter what precautions people take&nbsp; in the end it is never fool proof and eventually&nbsp; it will break down.<br /><br />So&nbsp; trying to pinpoint&nbsp; how and why is really a waste of time unless you are the vender or the buyer and want/need to retrace the steps you took that might have sounded an alarm.&nbsp; Unless you are one of the two individuals you are just guessing in the dark at any number of things that might have happened.<br /><br />If anything should come of this thread is that&nbsp; venders be safe and slow&nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; &nbsp;think every step over 3 times before you make to be certain it is done correctly. Buyers&nbsp; keep quiet and&nbsp; never admit guilt and always politely ask for an attorney. It serves no one to be rude and nasty to the&nbsp; police. They are mostly good people too. Lot&#039;s of bad apples&nbsp; but most just doing their job and what they think is right and remember his&nbsp; &nbsp;opinion of you may turn a prosecutors mind right or left in which direction to charge you.&nbsp; Slap on the wrist or&nbsp; why me time?&nbsp; That is if you are even charged and if you&nbsp; do things here the way you are suppose to and be safe and secure and use good judgement and do not always listen to what people here tell you to do as far&nbsp; as&nbsp; what information you give out&nbsp; (including my self)&nbsp; &nbsp;you should never have to worry about jail.&nbsp; You might get arrested and taken downtown on a charge&nbsp; but&nbsp; a conviction should never happen unless you&nbsp; fucked yourself some where down the line.<br /><br />In the end if you are not street smart enough or&nbsp; got your Mr.Spock hat on at all times&nbsp; you should probably not&nbsp; even be here. But it is your freedom&nbsp; so who I am to say?<br /><br />I just wish every one happy times and&nbsp; safe endeavors and always remember that&nbsp; &quot;Discretion is always&nbsp; the better part of valor&quot; and &quot;The word impossible is found only in the dictionary of fools&quot; <br /><br />Those extra ten steps you take might be time consuming and&nbsp; &nbsp;hear others call you paranoid but it might just might mean the difference between&nbsp; bread and water and&nbsp; a jail cell and you chillin home on the couch high on your favorite&nbsp; product with your woman playing&nbsp; 360. <br /><br />In the end&nbsp; who wins?&nbsp; &nbsp;Super&nbsp; Powers 1984 --- :&quot;you decide&quot;
