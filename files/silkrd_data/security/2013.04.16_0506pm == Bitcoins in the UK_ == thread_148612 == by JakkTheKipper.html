				Probably been a thread already about this but the search bar keeps giving me the five second error. Anyway, I would love to be able to buy bitcoins quickly in the UK but it seems all avenues have dried up. I used to use Blockchain.info but they fucked me over on my last purchase with no way of me getting my money back either so fuck using them ever again.<br /><br />Where are all you UK people getting your coins?

				localbitcoins.com<br /><br />if you can transfer money using online banking<br />then you can have your coins within 5 minute<br /><br />this service uses&nbsp; escrow so there is no way to get scammed<br /><br />

				Two solid suggestions, thanks. I was eyeballing the transferwise &gt; Bitstamp route but I really would need them quicker than a week, in the future I will definitely be giving this way a try though. I checked out localbitcoins and the only person offering coins even close to the weighted average has no trades and one negative feedback. There is no way I am willing to pay £63 a coin from the other vendors either. I think I&#039;ve been spoiled with all the great services I&#039;ve used in the past and now I couldn&#039;t possibly wait a week for coins but it looks like I&#039;ll have to.<br /><br />

				Thanks Flames but I&#039;m just after a tiny amount of coins and the minimum spend with that vendor is £100 so I am a bit gutted because it does look like they offer a great service. I&#039;ll check out BTC4Cash UK for sure, they seem pretty decent. Thanks.<br /><br />Edit: I think I got the vendors mixed up but either way none of the UK dealers can help me out :(

				are you having a laugh? this guys accounts 20days old and he only excepts cash! if your looking for the next big scam you may have just found it. he gains nothing by selling at the avg gox price, so why do it? if he was a legit coin exchange he would need to make something, be careful&nbsp; its happened many times over so stick with a trusted vendor or risk loosing your cash.

				so what exactly is he gaining from this then cos if he buys at gox and sells at gox prices he is wasting his time and if hes vending and exchanging then he is playing a risky game that he will end up loosing. if some one sells at market price there either a scammer or vendor either way it will end badly for hum or one of you you simply cant mix the two, to LE he will stand out cos of the price he sales at cant you see that?&nbsp; and if you spent 8k with a vendor who has been here for 20days with no escrow coin trade you need your head examining!

				I&#039;ve been looking into opening a CitiBank account with an offshore euro current account - they allow free SEPA transfer EUR-&gt;EUR funded from your GBP account (at standard currency xchange rates..I think they use VISA&#039;s day rate) <br /><br />OR<br /><br />You can get shafted by your UK bank, pay THEM the £10-25 fee for SEPA, and get a shitty deal on the exchange rate! seems to me that this is them playing fun &amp; games imho..they put pressure on TW to stop receiving payments going to exchanges, but will still happily process them, themselves..<br /><br />OR<br /><br />Apparently you can use moneygram via the PostOffice, not sure on fees re. that one! <br /><br />OR<br /><br />Localbitcoins or BitBargain - I&#039;ve used both, you need to go on at BUSY times to get the best price, usually about £3-5 mark-up on the MTGX rate though :(
