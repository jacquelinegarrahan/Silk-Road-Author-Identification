				GUYS, I made the order!!!<br /><br />Now its telling me (for the last 3 hours) that&#039;s it processing. Still. Now this from Australia BUT i did one thing that worries me.<br /><br />When I wrote down my full p.o. box address, i left out UNITED STATES on the bottom. I wrote the seller and told him frantically is was the U.S. Now he could gv online and look up my zip code and state BUT still, you guys see any problems????<br /><br />Thanks!

				You are cool brother. Don&#039;t worry. All is well. The Universe and SR are operating normally.<br />The order may stay in the &quot;In Processing&quot; status for up to 24 hours. The vendor (presumably) has a life so we should give him time to check it, package it and then put it &quot;In Transit&quot; <br /><br />The fact that you left out the country is, from what I can tell, a common error. But he&#039;ll probably figure it out (i mean after-all how many Texas&#039;s or Wisconsin&#039;s are there in the world?) And you did message him right after so he&#039;s probably aware. <br /><br />Anyway, chill, blow a fat one and wait a week or so (could be longer depending on shipping method). Welcome to SR and your new found freedom. Did you use encryption to send your mailing address?

If they do not process it within this time, you are free to cancel it. Most vendors process their orders within 24 - 48 hours.<br /><br />As far as forgetting to include a certain detail of your address is concerned, it does happen occasionally. As you messaged your vendor and they have not yet sent the package, you should be just fine. Even if they didn&#039;t get a chance to read your email, it is highly likely that they would contact you before sending as not having a country listed in the address field would mean that the postal service would not be able to deliver the package.

				You&#039;re absolutely fine. Based on the zip code and your messages to the vendor you have nothing to worry about.
