				I would spend just 10 minutes and learn how to use encryption for your address.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />When you receive your package, know the following:<br /><br />1.

It&#039;s not even hard to learn. When I got here I didn&#039;t know how to use GPG etc but it took me 1 evening to learn which for what it actually gives you is a very small amount of effort. If you can&#039;t be bothered to learn how to use it then you can&#039;t be bothered to look after your clients (if you are a vendor) or your own safety. If you can&#039;t be bothered to look after your own safety, you may as well just slap the handcuffs on yourself now. <br /><br />

The danger factor with using SR is either things being clocked in the post or not buying/cashing out your BTC securely. If the police are going to come after SR, that&#039;s how it will be done.

				It&#039;s very easy to setup an encrypted Truecrypt-volume to keep some private files and programs on so why not.<br />Ive heard of people that supposedly had their computers seized for pretty small things, so keeping your files secretly out of reach may be a good precaution I think. Even when buying small amounts or commiting minor crimes.. never know-shit happens so why not, take ya 10 min to setup ready from the time you decide to download it.<br /><br />It will basicly be a normal file you can put anywhere and disguise as anything, that you can open with the Truecrypt program and then it will ask for a password. Upon entering the correct password you get a new harddrive visible from My Computer that you can store files on. When done (or turning off the computer) you close it, and the files are stored secretly within that file.<br /><br />As a minimum you could put Tor and install some programs there, and every time before you need them you just enter the password. Very easy and fast, storing all potentially incrimination things there could save some trouble. Also its very convenient to move that 1 file to another computer or such..&nbsp; <br /><br />That way you are sure that even if others gain physical access to your computer and by-pass all other security, your stuff is safe there and noone will even know you have it.<br /><br />Im just a small-time buyer myself, but are using such a Truecrypt volume as a minimum.&nbsp; Now noone can tell that I have Tor, openvpn software, memo files (transaction# etc).<br /><br />Its also an advantage to have files hidden in a simple way like this way incase you are hacked or something- having important files encrypted and out of immediate reach.
