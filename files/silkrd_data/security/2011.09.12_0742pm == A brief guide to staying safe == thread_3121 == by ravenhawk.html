				This guide is not designed for complete newbies, as you should have researched this as on your own as soon as you registered here, thus I don&#039;t go into much detail at each step. It&#039;s purpose is rather to remind of some things and maybe help improve your security a little.<br /><br />No matter what, if you are receiving drugs, you have to assume that one day cops will knock on your door. They will probably won&#039;t have anything on you YET but they will take your computer to search for incriminating stuff. So, you must ensure the proper protection of sensitive files, which can be done by encryption.<br /><br /><br />Step 1: Create a TrueCrypt container with hidden volume. Preferably give it an inconspicuous name and extension (windows98.iso) and store it between similar files.<br /><br />Step 2: Copy some pseudo-sensitive info to the normal volume (porn, old passwords, etc.).<br /><br />Step 3: Transfer all sensitive info to the hidden volume, and I mean ALL (think hard):<br /><br />*GPG keys<br />*SilkRoad, MtGox, TradeHill, and every other password<br />*BTC wallet<br />*Text documents with heavy drug related info (this is not incriminating but still better not to let them know you are interested in drugs)<br />*whatever else you have, don&#039;t leave anything to law-enforcement agents!<br /><br />Step 4: Clean up a little.<br /><br />*Uninstall GPA software (better download gpg4usb and use it to manage GPG keys directly from TrueCrypt volume)<br />*Uninstall other cryptographic software if you have. It&#039;s not illegal but don&#039;t give them reason to think you have something to hide. Better get portable versions of them and store them on encrypted volume.<br />*Clean browser history, certain bookmarks, cookies, temporary files if needed.<br />*Delete whatever else that might be suspicious.<br /><br />Step 4: Wipe free space on all drives! (only 1 pass is necessary)<br /><br />This is very important&nbsp; so that the moved to TrueCrypt container and deleted files cannot be restored by undelete applications. You can do it with software like Eraser or even CCleaner(&gt;Tools&gt;Drive Wiper). Be sure you are deleting only FREE SPACE!<br /><br />Step 5: Backup all important data and store it at a friends house. Assume that your PC will be taken at some point. Even though nothing will be found to incriminate you (if you did everything right) but important data might get lost forever.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also to remember:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t transfer BTC directly (TradeHill/etc&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Online Wallet (or Laundering) &gt; Online Wallet 2 &gt; SilkRoad).<br />2. Use different BTC address for each transfer.<br />3. Transfer bitcoins through Tor, use &#039;New Identity&#039; on the Tor control panel between each transfer.<br />4. When you have received the package, leave it unopened for a few days (you could always say you didn&#039;t order this and were about to throw it out or return to sender).<br />5. In worst case scenario, do not say ANYTHING to the cops, talk to your lawyer first.<br /><br /><br />Do you approve it? Did I leave something out?<br />

				1 pass for disk cleaning may be not sufficient.<br /><br />If you had sensitive data on HDD and moved it to encrypted volume, make sure to erase all the data with <br />http://www.killdisk.com/ or Eraser http://eraser.heidi.ie/ <br />Both are free.

				Why not just encrypt the entire drive? Isn&#039;t that a lot easier? Then you don&#039;t have to worry about LE getting ANYTHING, as long as you shut down the PC whenever not in use.

But all keys are saved in the PGP-program. How can you save just the keys in a special (encrypted) place if PGP-desktop has to be on C:\ ?<br /><br />Thx&nbsp;

I use TrueCrypt to encrypt my entire drive, and never leave the computer unlocked, and power it off when i leave the house.

Police can not make you give them your password. 5th Amendment to the US constitution protects you against self incrimination. Police will however use social engineering to get you to give them, or guess, your password. No obstruction of justice charges apply here either.<br /><br />BTW, this is first hand information from someone who works with LE ;)

				Always use PGP and encrypt your hard drive or thumb drive. We always try to get customers to use PGP. SO IMPORTANT!

				Rush Limbo,<br /><br />Thanks for correcting me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like giving wrong info.&nbsp; I hate saying this, but it&#039;s kind of good to hear I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; Then I guess it&#039;s just safe to say it&#039;s better if they don&#039;t suspect you&#039;re hiding anything from them whatsoever, data or otherwise.<br /><br />Cubehead
