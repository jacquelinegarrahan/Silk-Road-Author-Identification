				Hi, first time US buyer here; So I&#039;ve been trying to get this order going for quite some time now (all I&#039;m looking to get at first is a sample of MDMA) and when I first started looking into SR I took little to no precaution.&nbsp; I downloaded Tor browser, GPA, and all the jazz onto my laptop instead of a USB.&nbsp; Also, I created my MtGox account while on my desktop and xferred my bit coins to SR.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m not sure how bad this one is but when I went to the bank for the InstaBit bank deposit to get my bit coins, they had me fill out a deposit slip which I stupidly filled out with my real info thinking they were going to ask for an ID of some sorts.&nbsp; Since there&#039;s only about $70 invested into this would it be a much better idea to, say, start over and do it right?&nbsp; $70 is still money so if anyone thinks I&#039;ll be fine ordering just 1g of MDMA from Canada to the US anyways then I will probably do it. Thanks for taking the time if anyone decides to help.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah, not the best way, but really, no big deal.<br /><br />LE does not care about you.&nbsp; Really, they would be wasting vast amounts of resources just to track you down.<br /><br />More importantly, even though there was an address associated with you in RL, after your first transfer there is only circumstantial evidence connecting you with further transfers.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, that was $100 I spent on &lt;insert anything you want.&gt;&nbsp; I have no idea who that person was, but they told me to send the money to that address.&quot;&nbsp; Any lawyer at all will get you off if it comes to that.&nbsp; (I want to emphasize that you should not tell LE anything if they talk to you.&nbsp; Nothing at all.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; The only way you will get convicted of anything is if you talk to the police.)<br /><br />There is nothing special about your SR address; there is no way to tell that it is associated with SR.&nbsp; (At least a priori.)&nbsp; However, if you are still feeling paranoid, just transfer your funds out of your SR address to a laundry like TorWallet.&nbsp; (No idea if they are trustworthy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve sent a few hundred through them with no problem though.)&nbsp; Then back to SR.<br /><br />Note: this is advice for a small-time end-user.&nbsp; Vendors should be a bit more paranoid.<br />

				The amount you have ordered will more than likely&nbsp; be sent as letter mail and has a very high chance of making it to you, but in the event that it doesn&#039;t make it to you, and ends up in somebody Else&#039;s hands, nothing will happen, probably just be destroyed. But even if something does come from it and you get a knock on the door, just deny it, anyone, can send anyone, anything in the mail. I often send out grams of mdma to random addresses &lt;_&lt;
