				Start by running a Malwarebytes full scan in safe mode with networking.&nbsp; Just search mbam and it should come up.&nbsp; You can also try Combofix but that is a powerful, last resort kind of program that can seriously mess up your system if done improperly.&nbsp; There are also many websites which will provide you personalized assistance removing viruses (via a forum).&nbsp; They assign a virus removal expert to work on your case and tell you how to get the appropriate information off your computer.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t used one of these sites in a long time but make sure to only use free ones, if anyone tries to charge you for removing a virus, move on.&nbsp;

Just a whole bunch of typo-laden bullshit, and exactly no answers about why the virus is supposed to be bad.<br />=====The following might just be conjecture=====<br />Anyway Guru, I have to disagree with you about tossing the machine. The most aggressive virus will fuck with the hard-drive in a very direct way to try to hide itself, and of course we&#039;ve all heard of rootkits and MBR-viruses...<br /><br />None of those are actually that hard to clean off, last I checked. The first step is to consider that your OS is now bunk and accept the need for a reinstall. Also a good idea to format the drive, of course. But it&#039;s not like a virus can run when it&#039;s not an &quot;active computer file&quot;, so even a quick-format works on most viruses. Then there is the MBR problem, of course. With an MBR-virus... still cleared by the format, really. Same with rootkits. A few viruses will actually change up your partitions... that&#039;s just a re-partitioning to fix, I&#039;m pretty sure.<br /><br />And that covers all of the broad-stroke viruses. Anything else that can squeeze into a computer in a way that won&#039;t be fixed by a format/new hard drive, is very specifically targeted to the hardware in such a computer.<br />=====Conjecture-end=====<br /><br />But... seriously. Guru, the only thing that shouldn&#039;t be trusted is the hard drive, at most. And it&#039;s a rare virus that can get through the hard-drive in a way that formatting won&#039;t fix.<br /><br />Unless I&#039;ve missed recent developments in the virus-coding scene or something, I suppose. As far as I know, the above should be accurate.
