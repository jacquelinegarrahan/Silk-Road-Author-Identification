				Ok so I&#039;m really new to this whole deposit in a foreign account thing<br /><br />When I waltz into my BoA, should I go to the teller first and ask for a deposit slip? What kind of deposit slip should it be?<br /><br />All i could find were checking and savings account deposit slips at the little table with slips, neither of which seemed to be capable of fitting the account # given to me by bitcoin.<br /><br />Also, is there any problem with using my real name on the deposit slip? I don&#039;t want to have to make all this shit up only to get the dreaded ID question and have to explain away <br /><br />I mean, buying BTC isn&#039;t illegal right? It shouldn&#039;t be an issue if I wash my BTC properly correct?<br /><br />Thanks :3

				You need to ask for an OUT OF STATE deposit slip and those are behind the tellers counter.&nbsp; Ask for a few extra so next time you can just have one ready is what I have done.&nbsp; &nbsp;You only need to put the name of the account....so that&#039;s GetBitcoin LLC and then the account #.&nbsp; &nbsp;YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT YOUR NAME OR SIGN THE SLIP <br /><br />Then email the address they gave you when you made the deposit reservation and send an image of the deposit reciept and the order # they gave you.<br /><br />Then you need to wait......

				I&#039;ve just used get-bitcoin yesterday doing this but have done so many times with ExchB when they were still around.<br />The teller might ask you what state is the account located in (it&#039;s CT), besides that look clean. Don&#039;t look like a druggie, I guess. <br />Buying bitcoin isn&#039;t illegal, but if anyone happen to google what&#039;s it used for, the top results are drugs.

				I waltzed into a Wells Fargo branch today, got a regular old deposit slip off the counter, filled it out, and took it to the teller. She processed the deposit and gave me a receipt with no mention of ID. I only filled out the account number, the name of the account holder (get-bitcoin), and the cash amount deposited.&nbsp; I am NOT in CT, and it wasn&#039;t an issue.

				The Out Of State deposit slip is needed at BoA only.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used these guys yesterday and had my coins by the end of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;They answered my emails along the way too. :-)<br /><br />

				I may have spoken too soon. I placed an order on 11-2, made the deposit on 11-3, and have heard nothing from G-B about the deposit having been received, and have received nothing into my wallet. My buy bid was low, but not so low that I would have imagined having made NO trades by now. <br />Emailed G-B two hours ago and have not yet heard back.<br />I&#039;ll keep you all updated.

				I have only used Get-btc once but if you did a cash deposit, then I really do not think there is a minimum bid. It is a fixed rate exchange I believe, and bitcoins are sold for the current median or avg price that btc are being traded for. That number is not a bid, just the most you are willing to pay for each bitcoin. Therefore, if the current value of btc is above the price you listed, then your transaction will not be processed.<br /><br />So basically I think what happened is your value was too low and the order did not go through, but since it is an anonymous deposit... its not exactly like they can return the money. You should have received the btc nearly instantly. Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />You should also check to make sure your email went through and the pic was attached properly.

				Update: I received a reply from G-B stating that they indeed have received my deposit and that my order is being held &quot;by customer request&quot;. I&#039;m assuming that means that my bid was too low for immediate purchase. I&#039;ve been watching bc values all evening, and it looks like my asking price is about $.08 lower than average. If trends keep up the way they are, I imagine my order will be filled tomorrow. If not, I&#039;ll email G-B and ask if I can change my bid.

				I used them on one occasion and they came through for me. I would use them again. I&#039;d trust them over any moneypak exchanger on SR (except for the few trusted ones..)<br /><br />They can take longer than they make it seem on their website though...&nbsp; at least they did for me...<br /><br />good experience overall, recommended :)

				Yep: nothing but good experiences here.&nbsp; All my transactions have been quick, about 1-3 hrs...however, somebody posted in another thread that his was taking all night, so we need to remember the guarantee is &#039;within 24 hrs&#039; but that&#039;s still a good guarantee...and the fact you don&#039;t need to sign up, so they get no info, and as all have noted: no id required....really good, other than you photo in the bank haha....but that&#039;s cool: I like speculating in btc, and I&quot;m glad they&#039;re legal.&nbsp; ...and more and more, I don&#039;t need to bring them back to me, as I also trust instawallet.org...so a couple of those as temporary addresses, and there you go...handy little item, and lately, finally, stable, fairly so...<br /><br />But also, I never put anything in the &#039;max&#039; column either...you don&#039;t need to, and they&#039;ll just give you whatever the daily value is...the only time I got held up, was cuz accidentally my computer put a &#039;1&#039; in that column--or the software did--so my purchase was held up, until it got that &#039;low&#039; I guess...but they are very recpetive and friendly about email, so just email them if you have concerns...

				Bitcoins are now trading well below my bid price, and I have not received any coins or comment from G-B. I hope he (?) manages to process my bid before rates go back up.

				How long as your order been open for Slim?&nbsp; Have you tried to email them about adjusting what you put in your &quot;max bid&quot; column?&nbsp; I&#039;d highly recommend leaving that field blank going forward, for anybody using get-bitcoins.com.&nbsp; They can be really slow sometimes, but they do eventually get back to you via email if you shoot them one to support@get-bitcoins.com.&nbsp; Just make sure to include your Order# in the email.

				I placed my order Wednesday, and made the deposit Thursday. As I mentioned above, this morning the bc rates got down past my bid price, so I hope to get my order filled ASAP.

				One thing on get-btc.com is that unless you *want* a limit, to make sure that field is blank--like brezer said--as the one time my order started taking longer than an hr, and I emailed them, they said I had put a &#039;1&#039; in that field...I know I didn&#039;t do that, and as soon as I told them that, they put it back to zero, and then my order got filled...I&#039;m wondering if the default might be &#039;1&#039; or my computer filled in a &#039;1&#039; or something like that...in any case, their guarantenn is for 24hrs, and so far, they&#039;ve been a lot quicker than that, for me, and way quicker than old way, thru dwolla and tradehill or mtgox...

				Could the issue have something to do with how the max price interacts with get-bitcoin&#039;s fee? For instance if you set a max price of $3, the &quot;market price&quot; might be just below that, but after the 5% fee, you&#039;d be paying just a bit more. I&#039;m not completely sure which way they figure it.
