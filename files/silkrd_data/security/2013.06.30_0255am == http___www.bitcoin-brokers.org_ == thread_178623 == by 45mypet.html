				I was going to use them earlier today, but I sent them a request to late because my bank closes at 2pm on saturday. The guy I was talking with was helpful though. I have always used bitinstant, but they have been having problems recently. The hunt for a place to purchase bitcoins was in order. <br /><br />I started using btcQuick today and I really like it so far, for whatever that is worth. lol

				Main problem I see with this site is limited bank hours on weekends to make cash deposits. Seems good other than that.

				So how does it work actually? I only see what banks we can deposit at but no listings...Or do I just request the amount and which bank through the help desk?

				the way i understand from reading thru a thread made on bitcointalk, more less a middle man linking direct sellers of coins and us buying coins.&nbsp; tell him how much money you want to deposit &amp; at which bank is convenient to you, and btc addy.&nbsp; he responds with a sellers account info (name &amp; acct #) to deposit into.&nbsp; go home scan/ take picture of deposit slip and send him email with attachment, he in turn sends to seller to confirm deposit, seller confirms &amp; he releases the coins to the addy you sent him.&nbsp; pretty much the same method for me to acquire thru BST.
