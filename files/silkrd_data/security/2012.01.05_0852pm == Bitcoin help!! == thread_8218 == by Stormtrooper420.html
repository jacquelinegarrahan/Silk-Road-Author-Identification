				I used to use get-bitcoin all the time, they were a great exchanger that I could trust. And what I really liked was using a Wells Fargo and just having my coins in a few hours. I use large amounts of money and thats why I am sorta dissapointed to start at square one again :/ anybody have a simple, trustworthy, anonymous bitcoin exchanger?? Thanks so much everybody! :)

				I recommend you to find one or a hand-full on #bitcoin-otc (freenode-irc, or clearweb: hxxp://bitcoin-otc.com/ ), most of the time there are several traders online and (depending on your way of paying) you&#039;ll get your coins instantly.<br />There is also a trusted seller list for huge amounts.<br /><br />Otherwise have a look at the money section on SR ( hxxp://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/category/98 ).<br />I can&#039;t tell you who to trust there, but you should find infos on the forum here. (Using search is soooo cool :D )

				Thanks K1K1 :) and I realise that get-bitcoin is still running, it just seems every option requires a non anonymous way of exchanging requiring ID, bank account, etc. I do not wanna risk that lol :)

				Not every trader on #bitcoin-otc need that.<br />Some are exchanging for PSC or U-Kash, you just need to finde the right one.<br />But prepare to pay a little fee for that service ;)

				X-post from a similar thread:<br /><br />Sugar Mama, internationally acclaimed bitcoin dealer, will sell you bitcoins right here on SR to your SR account: If you are anywhere in the world you still can STILL send me money via western union or moneygram for NO FEE!! There are probably more WU stores than there are wells fargos anyway. Just cover the WU/MG costs (low) and get your coins straight to SR no external site needed. <br /><br />I also exchange moneypaks for bitcoins.<br />Check out my vendor page for more information on buying bitcoins through Sugar Mama.

				BE CAREFUL ALL....There is information going about that MoneyPak is starting to enforce their &quot;illegal activity warning&quot; on the back of the card. I and others in my community are&nbsp; getting reliable reports of MoneyPak cancelling the card on people after purchase due to &quot;belief that the funds to be transferred are associated with illegal activity. The money is taken by MonePak and kept in escrow for 30 days which is the amount of time the cardholder has to dispute the allegation and request an investigation in an attempt to recover the taken money. This is a blatant attempt to set an example to deter any illegal activities. So as not to go through all of this I now do nothing but BANK DEPOSIT with CASH for Bitcoins. Sorry but you have to be as safe as possible and though there is a chance to get your money reinstated who wants to go through all this BS when you don&#039;t have to risk it. BE CAREFUL!!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m with russo on this. being able to walk into a back and give a teller cash with no ID makes me feel about as safe about this as I&#039;m going to. While there are plenty of others out there offering great service, this just feels the safest. at least for now. <br />my only question is the wallet address. is there any way to trace that address to SR? I&#039;m under the impression that it can&#039;t but people believe all sorts of crazy shit. as long as the location of the wallet if obscured then i think cash deposits with get-bitcon are about as safe as this is going to get given the options. <br />
