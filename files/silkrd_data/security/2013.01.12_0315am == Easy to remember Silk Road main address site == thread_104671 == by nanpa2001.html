				It seems like people are getting phished all the time by look-alike URLs of the Silk Road main site, and many people are too paranoid to bookmark SR, so I have created a tinyurl that is easy to remember.<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/sr000

				Well SR, what do you think? While the URL you ultimately end up on matches up, is there any chance this could be going through a proxy that records your data?

				Thanks to the OP, but I wouldn&#039;t touch this link. Besides, I can easily remember SR address, not that hard.&nbsp;

				Fuck, how hard is it to bookmark the site and transfer your bookmarks to each new updated version of Tor you use.&nbsp; ???

				It is easy to bookmark, but some users are too paranoid to bookmark and too drugged-up to remember lol.<br /><br />The link itself should be relatively safe. It is clearnet, at least before it jumps to SR, but isn&#039;t hiding your identity the entire point of using Tor? If using tinyurl could reveal your identity when using Tor, then Tor is finished.

				If someone is too drugged up to bookmark a web page, what hope have they got of even being able to log on, let alone use the site safely.&nbsp; ::) If you&#039;ve encrypted either your USB or HDD, one shouldn&#039;t be paranoid about a bookmark, surely! There is just absolutely no point of having to access a clearnet URL just to gain access to the SR&#039;s homepage URL. Sorry mate, just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me.

				If you use preview.tinyurl, you will see that it goes straight to SR. I&#039;d trust it. Even if you wouldn&#039;t trust that link, it&#039;s a good concept. Just could just make your own Tinyurl.

				Well... my bookmarks, tor, vpn, and so on are contained within an encrypted USB.<br /><br />There are many, many users that are getting scammed by look-alike sites that get their SR details. These people probably enter SR through the onion.to site. Anyway, in a pinch, the link I posted can be useful. If someone can show me that it is dangerous, I would be interested to hear the rationale.
