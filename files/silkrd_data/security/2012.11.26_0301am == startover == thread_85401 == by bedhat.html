				I have a question regarding the Moneygram fee. As I have never used a moneygram before. But I tried the other day but the person wouldnt put it through because she said it was showing up without a fee. And she didn&#039;t want to put it through because there was no fee showing up and she had never seen that before. (an older lady, gave me a real hard time, I just said forget it). Is the zipzap 3.95 the moneygram fee? or is that the zipzap fee? Because when I filled out the blue form I included the 3.95 as what I was depositing. Should I just put what I&#039;m depositing, and then that is to be left out and payed as the fee?<br /><br />Thank you in advanced!

				Using a online wallet does help with anonymity. Its not as good as using a coin tumbler but it its not true that it doesn&#039;t do anything. Also everyone seems to forgot SR tumbles your coins when you make a deposit.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br /><br />Also, if you are buying bitcoins anonymously there is no reason to pay for a mixing service. Its a waste of money.

				Guys take off your TInfOIL hats... Your spending a lot xtra money to get coins and making it harder than it has to be.. Use fake name etc, go pay in cash send it straight to your SR address and uour done. Soon as you get your coins SPEND THEM!! ..SR already had somewhat of a tumbler set up when the coins come in.. All these xtra steps your taking is great, but its really not needed and you are wasting money for foggin and all that. But if it makes u feel better and sleep smoother go ahead. Just make sure u learn ur PGP and use that of all things.. Iv been using the road for a looong time and i admit i took the same precautions at first. Remember it IS NOT ILLEGAL TO BUY BITCOINS!!!!

				To AnonymousAddict - Great info, however, I still have a question. <br />When on the Bitinstant website (through TOR of Course) there are two pulldown menu&#039;s. Pay from is easy =Walmart. <br />My question is that if we want to send the BTC straight to SR which menu item do we choose? The option are, MT. Gox, Bitcoil to e-mail, PayPal, BitStamp, Vir-Wox, Bitcoin Address, BTC-e.com. <br />I want all of my ducks in a row before I buy my first book on SR. Thanks!<br />
