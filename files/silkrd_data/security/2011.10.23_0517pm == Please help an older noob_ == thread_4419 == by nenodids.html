				i don&#039;t care about anything else with this tor i just care about Silk Road. i need to know is whats&nbsp; needed beside Tor to be safe and accomplished what i need too on Silk Road. I just need a list of programs i should DL and what they are for. Ill figure out how to work them and how to do everything from the forums. Its seems overwhelming when you see different programs in different threads and not sure what you&nbsp; need and what you don&#039;t. So from Email to Messaging to torifying shit. Just what do i need? I need to go on magical bike rides again, its been 15 years. HELP?

				I use TOR and PGP, and I&#039;ve been just fine.<br />Add a healthy dose of COMMON SENSE to it as well of course. <br />Encrypt your messages, use IRL (in real life) precautions, and never order more than you&#039;re willing to take the fall for. <br />(most quantities available on SR will only get your an IRL slap on the hand... a gram of weed or a hit of acid? Srsly. <br />Just keep it to personal quantities and you&#039;ve eliminated 90% of the risk on SR for a buyer.

				dont trust the above guy,especially with a username like that.lol<br /><br />download these programs, all of them,and then come back here and tell me which program you are having problems with and i will gladly be of assistance..it may seem alot but once you have them in order you will have the most secure system on the planet, all else is just&nbsp; honeypot<br /><br /><br />Metasploit Framework <br />ping2<br />etcat<br />Wireshark <br />Tcpdump <br />OpenSSH / PuTTY / SSH <br />Paros proxy <br />Dsniff <br />NetStumbler <br />GFI LANguard<br />etfilter <br />Sysinternals <br />Retina

				Part of paying your dues around here, is learning how to use the needed apps.&nbsp; You got here, so, if you want to, you obviously *can* do the footwork, u know, go thru all the shit on bitcoins, all the shit on live linux distros, and all the shit on pgp4win gpg in general, blah blah blah.<br /><br />I know it sucks.&nbsp; But it also sucks for one of us to take the time to write out a long and tedious page or two, on how *we* did all our footwork....only to get the same exact question from another newbie tomorrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, I know how frustrating it is.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all been there.&nbsp; Good that you are on forums first tho ... most newbies go straight to main site, make a buy, get talked into sending the money directly to some bus stop in newark, then come here crying about how they got ripped.<br /><br />You are going to get real used to using the fucking search engine.&nbsp; I know I did.&nbsp; Damn sure learned&nbsp; a lot...if you want to make it even more of a hassle, use Tails or Liberte Linux....but anyway, good luck, look around...and get some heroin, quick.&nbsp; makes u feel young and beautiful again, for about 4 hrs... ;)<br /><br />Get pgp first.&nbsp; Make yourself a private/public key pair.&nbsp; Then u can install the vendors public key, which u can use to encrypt yer address.<br /><br />Then I&#039;d get tails, it&#039;ll keep u honest, tho liberte linux is even more protective, but does have persistence of data.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, in future, when you want assistance, put this in title bar: &quot;Nineteen Year Old Female Porn Star Noob Needs Help!&quot;&nbsp; Seems to work better.<br /><br />o well, all kinds of choices to make...but you&#039;re here, you&#039;ll figure it out...

				No idea why you need the plethora of programs listed above. The following works just fine imo (for light buyers, sellers might need something more advanced):<br /><br />1. Truecrypt - Use it to create a Dual Layer AES/Twofish encrypted USB drive. (Google a tutorial)<br /><br />2. Download the TOR Browser Bundle, and extract it onto the hidden layer of Encrypted USB drive. (you will use this to access SR)<br /><br />3. Download PGP Portable, and extract that to your hidden layer of encrypted USB drive. Google a tutorial on how to create your own Public key, and how to import sellers Public keys. you will use this to send encrypted messages (ie your name and address) to sellers so that only they can decrypt the message.<br /><br />4. Download Eraser Portable, and extract that to your hidden layer of encrypted USB drive. Get in the habbit of performing regular FREE/UNUSED DISK SPACE wipes of your USB drive and your computers main C: drive (do it after you have cleared your browser cache/history/cookies). Tripple pass is what I stick to.<br /><br />5. Create a .txt file on your hidden encrypted USB drive and keep the SR url on there, never access SR through links on the internet.<br /><br />I personally NEVER transfer BTC&#039;s from exchanges to a wallet stored on your USB drive or hard drives.<br /><br />6. Instead, access www.instawallet.org through TOR (everytime you type in www.instawallet.org and hit enter, it creates a new anon wallet), save the wallet address and URL in a&nbsp; temporary .txt file on your encrypted USB. <br /><br />Transfer your BTC&#039;s to the instawallet, leave them there for at least 4 hrs, which will in effect make those coins harder to trace. <br /><br />Create another 2 instawallets (its a good idea to click the &quot;Use a new identity&quot; button on the TOR control panel, so the other two wallets look like they were created by different people, split your coins unevenly between the two new instawallets. Again leaving them in each wallet a further 4 hrs or so. <br /><br />Then deposit those coins into your SR wallet address, I usually create a new wallet address for my SR account for each instawallet, just so that its not blatently obvious that BTC&#039;s you bought were split up only to be perfectly merged into the same wallet 3 or 4 wallets later.

				Okay, perhaps I&#039;m an idiot... <br />I&#039;m not sure what that has to do with my USERNAME, but I am a newbie to the forums (although not to minor purchases on SR) and was just giving you what has worked for me. <br />I change my username every so often so that I don&#039;t have a long history, I am sure to think carefully about how my IRL packages will be received, not just letting the shipper do the worrying, and I never order anything major, just small, personal use items.<br />It works for me.<br />YES, if you plan to make shopping on SR into more than the occasional hobby and forum interaction... by ALL MEANS, get your secrecy on tight control. <br />But... As I said... don&#039;t make yourself a target, and chances are good that you won&#039;t be attacked...
