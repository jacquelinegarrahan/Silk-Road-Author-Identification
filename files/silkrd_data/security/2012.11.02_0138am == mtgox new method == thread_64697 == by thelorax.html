				15-20 minutes.<br /><br />It&#039;s lightning quick. You&#039;ll then need to put an order in to buy btc using your mt.gox cash before you can transfer out.

I honestly had no clue.. theres like 50 ways to fund MtGox, I thought maybe it was some direct new shit or something maybe.. no middle man!! Its not on MtGox its on the thirdparty if its delayed.. had that before with aurumxchange and like u said they fixed it ASAP!
