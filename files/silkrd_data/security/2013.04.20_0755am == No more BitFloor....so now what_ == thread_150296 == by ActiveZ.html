				Blue Sky Traders.. bitfloor was quick and easy, a little pricey.. i guess you can say the same about BST.<br /><br />http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />i use the early order method so often. just send them an email titled EARLY ORDER. then include the amount i want and wallet address.<br /><br />you will receive an email in the morning with an exact total to deposit. deposit the EXACT amount at a bank of america (same place as bitfloor) and you will have an email an possibly your coins by the time you arrive home. 8)

				I used bitinstant 2 times in the past 2 days and had ZERO problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;First time money was in my acct before I even got home....2nd time had to wait a few more minutes but nothing bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems as if their troubles might be behind them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Still would suck if they lost your $....but they are linked to some steady services still so I don&#039;t think they are intentionally scamming as has been mentioned.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Luck whatever way you choose.

				I hope that BST is good as BitFloor.&nbsp; To my knowledge the only other BTC exchange that takes cash is BST and BitInstant.&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to go back to BitInstant robber barons!!!
