				Ok, so I have to go through a new local guy for my supply of fire-mids. I dont know this guy personally, he was referred to me. The person who referred him is an acquaintance who occasionally is a customer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always known my suppliers first hand before but for this guy I want to play it safe in case he&#039;s undercover or a narc. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard making them take bong hits is a fairly-concrete way of making sure they arent undercover, is this true? They can fake joint hits and such but it&#039;s impossible to fake a solid bong hit. Is this a decent way to check? I&#039;ve also heard that they can do whatever drugs they want which is why I ask. <br /><br />And do they HAVE to wear a wire? Reason being I can get signal-jamming gear to place in the room to interfere with said electronics. If I were to tell them about said gear and they spooked this would obviously be a sign they were undercover, only if they were required to have a recording of the event. Is this the case?<br /><br />Any ideas or personal strats to avoid narcs? The most extreme way I could think of was a double blind drop with a faux pick-up to see if they nab the pickup but I&#039;m not entirely sure this guy would do that for just a Lb of fire-mids lol ($600 seems kinda low to warrant all that trouble from a supplier aspect) <br /><br />Thanks!

				I&#039;m not 100% sure, but I think if you ask them straight out if they are a cop, they have to tell you.<br />Otherwise, it is entrapment. You might want to look that up, but I think that is how it works where I am from.<br /><br />Always go with your gut instinct in these circumstances; if you feel something isn&#039;t right, get the fuck out of there.<br /><br />Best of luck,<br /><br />Psy

The cop didn&#039;t force you to buy/sell to him.

				Undercover cops can commit crimes, do drugs, assault people ... anything they want in furtherance of the investigation.

And so they are allowed to sell drugs? So buying a gram wont nec make them spring on me, they could wait till I come back for a lb? <br /><br />Its not like im running something like the Hells Angels. Alls I do is sell pot and molly lol. Its not like I&#039;ve ever killed anyone or even jumped somebody lol. Just dealed. And in my state even up to a lb if they caught me i wouldnt do that much time, even with distribution charges. Would they really allow a cop to forgo all the rules just for me? Again, not some huge, big time guy (im like small-to-medium time)

				If you want a lawyer, the best thing to do is find a good criminal lawyer that specializes in drug stuff and make friends with him/her. After you have spent some time together you can start picking their brain with hypothetical questions, or pay for an hour of their time and go in with a list of questions you want answered. Be aware that casual conversation isn&#039;t considered real legal advice, but it is a good way to get the answers to specific questions so you have an idea where your activities stand legally, without relying on rumor and conjecture. I wouldn&#039;t show up in the office and start confessing, but if you have a list of questions about illegal activities you really don&#039;t need to confess, lol.<br /><br />The way I did it is one married into the family, lol, so when we&#039;re smoking a j and shooting the shit I pick his brain. His official word is ALWAYS &quot;that would be a bad idea,&quot; followed with answers to my questions. He does not know what I do, though he does suspect I move product somehow. We don&#039;t discuss that. I learn a damn ton of stuff simply from listening to him tell stories and asking follow up questions. He gets more people off than not, and he is not cheap.

				Undercover cops do not have to reveal that they are a cop, not even if you ask them 3 times, or ask them for their badge number or whatever.<br /><br />However, they cannot distribute drugs into society. So a seller that delivers product, cannot possibly be an undercover cop. <br />

				Has anyone herd of fast and the furious. LEO sold guns and let them out on the market. NO one got in trouble. So based on that alone i guess they can sell drugs. maybe they should not but it is still possible. check this guy out. any facebook or twitter. pay a buddy to follow him home. does he drive. who owns the car? Bong hit works a little i think. plus buy the gram then go to the bathroom and flush it. something happens you can say you handed it off to a buddy through the window. Now he just released drugs on the street. or so he thinks. with that and a bong hit. go for it. just clean house first. and have a lawyer on call if you can. best move by far.

				Haven&#039;t you seen &quot;The Departed&quot; or &quot;Donnie Broscoe&quot; ?<br /><br />The undercover cops can and will do anything to make their case.&nbsp; The criminal informants can also do whatever they like to gather info.

				Guys, television and movies probably are not the best place to be seeking legal advice. That&#039;s like wanting to be some kung-fu master so you watch a lot of Jackie Chan movies.

I don&#039;t know if cops would allow a drug dealer to operate, in order to bust some buyers. It doesn&#039;t seem likely to me. If a seller gets busted, it&#039;s possible that cops go after all the buyers of whom he has information, but I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll make him an informant and let him continue selling. I think they&#039;d only do that if that way, they can catch a &quot;bigger fish&quot; than the dealer.<br /><br />Being smart about your pickup and stash locations is always recommended.

I&#039;m not sure how those rumors get started but it seems rather naive, and more importantly not based on a single fact.<br /><br />As for the fast and the furious which someone mentioned, most of the &quot;facts&quot; i see are republican talking points trying to pin a scandal on Obama when nothing of the sort happened. Not that i&#039;d like to defend the cops in any way but they did nothing illegal and in fact technically neither did the people buying guns. Reselling guns is legal and unless they can prove you intend to sell them to a criminal organization before you buy it there is nothing they can do. In fact if you read the fortune article I posted below you&#039;ll see that they had stopped some people who they were pretty certain were selling weapons to the mexican cartel and had bought weapons that ended up in crime scenes/murders in mexico but the courts defended these people&#039;s second amendment rights. &quot;Without Probable Cause and concurrence from the USAO [U.S. Attorney&#039;s Office] it is highway robbery if we take someone&#039;s property.&quot; My two favorite stories were the unemployed man who bought a 10k 50cal sniper rifle and the homeless man who bought 476 guns for $300k while on food-stamps. Neither of which could be stopped becuase they didn&#039;t do anything illegal, they couldn&#039;t even cut off the guys foodstamps knowing he spent at least 1/3 of a million dollars on weapons.<br />Clearnet<br />http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/06/27/fast-and-furious-truth/

I personally don&#039;t really have to worry too much about informants as my inner circle is only myself and two others (not to say that I don&#039;t know that&#039;s a possibility, anyone can turn on you). I wont even be the one picking up from this guy or dealing with him; i just wanted to make sure that my group was safe.

				All you need to know ... is if you are a big enough player the cops can do literally ANYTHING to capture you.<br /><br />They will go right to the edge of the law and then what they cant do, they will have CI&#039;s do. <br /><br />You need to ask yourself if your that important ... if you are just keep in mind the police dont often get beat and they dont stop.
