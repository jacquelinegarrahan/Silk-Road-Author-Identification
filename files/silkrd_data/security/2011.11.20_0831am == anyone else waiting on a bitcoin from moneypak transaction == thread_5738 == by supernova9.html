				48 hours have passed.&nbsp; Should I be worried&nbsp; Gave him 500USD and he said he&#039;d have it done by yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; Well, that time passed and he swore he&#039;d have it tonight if not yesterday evening.&nbsp; Sucks bad.&nbsp; My have well just used Mt.Gox&nbsp; There has to be a better way to do this so there is always btcs available for us.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of starting my own exchange.&nbsp; I have plenty of money, just need to know how to get going with it. I guess I wait until btcs are low and buy all I can low then try to sell hi?&nbsp; Seems pretty simple.&nbsp; How come more people<br />&nbsp;don&#039;t do it??

				I PM&#039;d a few and BTCBuddy got right back to me. He communicated in pretty much real time, was willing to negotiate, and I had my coins in minutes.<br />I ended up paying about 14% for my impatience but that&#039;s my fault. It&#039;s good that someone was there to satisfy my needs at the time I had them and that&#039;s what interest is all about.<br /><br />Borneo got back to me later and has good rates but I was in a hurry so took the first one who PM&#039;d, had coins, and was willing to negotiate.<br /><br />Took a chance and scored.
