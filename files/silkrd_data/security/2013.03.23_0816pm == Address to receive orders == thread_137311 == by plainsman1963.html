				I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question or already been covered but I did a search for business address and came up with nothing. <br /><br />I have a business, I am the only employee and the only one with the key. The mail box I have for the business is much bigger than the one I use currently for order reception. The business one will fit all orders I have received so far without having to head into the office to turn in the yellow card and receive my order. By the way this is USPS. <br /><br />What is the down side (if any) to ordering to a business name and address?

Years ago there used to be televisions adds on how to start up and run such companies. They supplied all of the merchandise and you did the orders and shipping with what ever mark up you could get. Take something like that on ebay, amazon and a couple of others and viola you could appear legit.. I am sure people have gt to be doing this..<br /><br />Nothing really..

				Thanks for the replies. I was hoping I was not missing something or vendors would balk at sending to a business name. My post office&#039;s office is only open an hour on Saturdays and sometimes they don&#039;t get the package notification card into my personal mailbox before the office closes, so I am shit out of luck until Monday. <br /><br />Not only does it slow down getting my product, but it slows down finalizing as well as I just don&#039;t like the idea of the package sitting there until Monday. <br /><br />Thanks again.

				Packages arrive at businesses all the time so its a good option. I like to mix it up a bit with delivery addresses wherever possible. Different names etc. Pays to be paranoid!
