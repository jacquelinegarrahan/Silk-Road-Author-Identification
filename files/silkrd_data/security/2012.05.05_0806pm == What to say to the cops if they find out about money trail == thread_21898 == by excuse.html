				Hello,<br /><br />What would be a good excuse to tell the cops if they raided someones house and found a lot of money laying around? Let&#039;s say an amount significant enough for you to have to explain yourself. <br /><br />They find no drugs, no data on computer, nothing incriminating besides a lot of money what could you tell them as a good explanation? <br /><br />Very curious&nbsp; ;)

				&quot;I don&#039;t trust banks, this is my life savings from mowing lawns and doing yardwork in my teenage years&quot;.<br /><br />Then go on to tell him why you don&#039;t trust banks<br /><br />&quot;Banks loan your money out to people. If the economy collapses and everyone tried to withdrawal all their money at the same time, it wouldn&#039;t be possible.&quot;<br /><br />Tell them you are a prepper. You fear for the economic collapse. They cannot just seiz your money unless they can pin you on a distribution charge.

				Say&nbsp; nothing, get a lawyer. Ask the cops if you are under arrest and to look at the search warrant. They must produce it if they don&#039;t you walk with your cash later.<br />

				In the US, they must find something illegal to consider that money illegal as well.&nbsp; See asset forfeiture.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, the bullshit part about it is they file the money as a separate case so that even if you get off the drug charges, you still have to fight for your money in court, which isn&#039;t easy once they already have it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Having one million dollars cash isn&#039;t illegal unless they have a distribution case to go with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tell them to fuck off and talk to your lawyer. that&#039;s it, they can&#039;t take it just because they want to UNLESS there is something illegal in your house, then you&#039;re fucked and that&#039;s dirty money anyway to them.

I had a friend that was dealing irl and did it through invite only but when his operation got too big the DEA took interest and began staking outside his place, they would harass/threaten his customers until one of them gave in and became an informant. He led them inside the place and my friend saw an agent sneaking on the side of the house so he ran out of the back and they ran in after him but he got away and then he came back later that night and was shitting bricks at this point, so he gets home and on his table was all of his cash fanned out and his shotgun/pistol under it. The cops went in without a warrant and couldn&#039;t take anything because of that.

				YOU DON&#039;T SAY ANYTHING!<br />you offer no explanation<br />that&#039;s what LAWYERS are for<br />let them do the talking. If they want to arrest you, let them. Just know that you&#039;re not spending more than 48 hours in a cell.
