				+1<br /><br />I think though a longer term solution would be to give us permanent storage on the forum. A repository for all intelligence gathered, with meta tag editable by users to allow easy harvesting of relevant infos. Because nice links have a habit of disappearing, either naturally over time or because LEO turned into even more of a little bitch. A couple of GB should do it. Also, the intell should be vetted. You could have members with 100 posts able to give * to ***** on items, and kmfkewm as a intelligence moderator/harmonizer (hey buddy, I got you a job and in this economy! :D) xD<br /><br />Repository categories could be like:<br /><br />- Computer Security<br />- Smuggling<br />- Chemistry<br />- Finance<br />- How To<br />- Legal<br /><br />etc&nbsp; <br /><br />

				+1 to all of this, especially the need for an intelligence subforum.<br /><br />There&#039;s a ton of great information that&#039;s been posted on these forums, but it&#039;s all spread out in different topics and different subforums.&nbsp; And I know there&#039;s even more that hasn&#039;t been posted yet.&nbsp; It would be great (necessary, in my opinion) to have one place to consolidate all of it.

				Why not use the Silk Road wiki for a repository? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />Easier to navigate and format articles in a hierarchical manner than the forums, no derailing thread banter to distract from the subject at hand and it&#039;s in a handy portable, shareable and open format.<br /><br />A complete and workable, up to date copy could be tarbelled and available for download with the click of a button, by anyone, anywhere, anytime.<br /><br />Everybody keeps talking about decentralization of data. What could be more decentralized than having the complete contents of a community sourced wiki available in an open and easy to obtain, easy to read, easy to host format.

				The trouble with that is that people who don&#039;t know anything about the topic at hand can contribute their shitty advice. (There are many things that people who do know what they&#039;re talking about can disagree on, but I&#039;ve been seeing lots of shitty advice here recently like using bitcoin proxies or not using PGP that nobody should be doing.) I think kmf is a good choice for any intelligence forum in the future as he knows what he&#039;s doing imo.

				Sticky it wiki it or search [intel] ;) whatever works.<br /><br />I never read past the OP if I think the info is good, so dickheads below it can write what they like as far as I am concerned.<br />
