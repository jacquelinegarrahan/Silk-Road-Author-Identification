				Not really sure. I think it will have a lot to do with where you live and the amount that was sent.&nbsp; The key here is, should someone come asking about it DENY DENY DENY you now anything about it.&nbsp; Some random person must have sent that to you by mistake or someone is trying to get you in trouble but deny you know anything about it.&nbsp; Doubt that anyone comes unless you had a really big package.

				Good advice. NEVER, EVER TALK TO COPS!!!! When they say &quot;everything CAN and WILL be used against you in a court of law&quot;, they mean EVERYTHING. If they are knocking on your door and not kicking it down, this known as a &quot;knock and talk&quot;; they do not have a warrant.<br /><br />Do not talk when they knock. In fact, don&#039;t even open the door for them. I would completely ignore them if at all possible, and if you do need to answer the door for whatever reason, make sure you step outside, lock the door behind you, and tell them you do not consent to a search and will not speak to them without a lawyer, etc... pretty much everything vo1d already mentioned lol.

				For anyone curious as to the many ways talking to cops can go wrong, here is an AMAZING video illustrating that. It really is worth your time to watch the whole thing.<br />Takes a good 5-10 minutes to get to the useful stuff.<br />hxxp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc

				That is a CLASSIC vid and is a MUST WATCH for anyone who does anything illegal, and even for those who don&#039;t. My favorite part is how he explains where what you REALLY said may not be incriminating, but the way the police RECORD what you said could be very different and incriminating. They may even do it as a simple mistake, and not with malicious intent, but we all know that most pigs are happy to lie to get you locked up. Even over something as simple as a plant that grows from the ground. In modern times, with drug laws being what they are, there is NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD COP. They don&#039;t exist anymore. They have a great way of grinning in your face and making you THINK they are one of the &quot;good ones,&quot; though. My interactions with police are ONLY as follows- &quot;Am I being detained?&quot; and if so, &quot;What probable cause or reasonable articulable suspicion do you have to believe I have committed a crime?&quot; If that doesn&#039;t get you unhooked then all that&#039;s left is, &quot;I retain all my rights and waive none, including my right to have a lawyer present during any questioning.&quot; Remember, you can NEVER talk your way out of a jail cell, but you CAN certainly talk your way into one! DON&#039;T FUCKING TALK TO COPS!!!
