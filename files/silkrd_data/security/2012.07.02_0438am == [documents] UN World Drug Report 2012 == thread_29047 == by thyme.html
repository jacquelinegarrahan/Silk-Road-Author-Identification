				The 2012 UN World Drug Report is out, for those who want it.<br /><br />It&#039;s large.edited: links break, look it up<br />ad has the table of contents, includes seizures, prices as reported, etc.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the bit on the online world (not much). <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Internet has had a major impact on the illicit drug business. For traffickers, it is now far easier to understand the price levels in various markets, obtain precursor chemicals and hide drug-related profits. Illicit drug users have started to use the Internet as a means of exchanging information about the use of various illicit drugs and on the best opportunities to acquire more potent drugs cheaply. Moreover, new drugs not yet under international control (such as those sold under the brand name Spice) have been successfully marketed via the Internet.<br />The Internet has also opened new avenues for drug control interventions. It is a crucial vector for spreading information about the risks associated with illicit drug use. Moreover, the Internet also provides authorities with an additional means to monitor the illicit drug market and the criminals’ planning and operations.&nbsp; It is also now easier for law enforcement authorities to cooperate closely across borders. That said, drug traffickers seem to have become more cautious — and sophisticated — in their Internet usage. Rich in cash, they have the means to employ top computer experts to ensure that their communications are encrypted, locations untraceable and stored files destroyed in case computers are seized. The speed of technological development as well as criminals’ rapid adaptation of the available technology to their needs presents major challenges to most countries’ regulatory bodies. Additionally, the absence of international Internet regulations makes it difficult to impede criminals who operate internationally.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
