				So i purchased some BTC yesterday, through bit instant, everything seemed ok, only it took like three hours to the coins credited to my SR acct. so then i was short for something i wanted, went back to the store put another few dollars in, but the second transaction still has not posted to my SR acct. its not been like 10 or 12 hours since then. Can any one give any suggestions? thanks

				BitInstant has a very active team that often reacts quickly to customer complaints posted on Clearnet forums.&nbsp; For example, the co-founder posts under the name &quot;Yankee&quot; at the forums of clearnet site Bitcointalk.&nbsp; Take a look at the &quot;show posts&quot; link at the bottom of his profile page and you can see that he is actively handling customer service there.&nbsp; <br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=21181<br /><br />Just mention the coins not showing up in your wallet, though; he doesn&#039;t need to know about the Road part.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure they also have customer service pages, but the benefit of a complaint on a forum full of BTC customers is that the BitInstant people have a bit of pressure to resolve your issue quickly to reassure other customers.&nbsp;
