				get-bitcoin seems to be quite expensive because of the 5% fee plus additional 10% for other currencies, didn&#039;t see a thread on this so asking away.

				Intersango. You can make deposits in cash at any branch of Lloyds so it&#039;s reasonably anonymous and they only charge a 0.65% fee on buying and selling BTC.

				yeah :) <br /><br />What you need to do is set up an intersango account, then note the bank details in accounts&gt;GBP&gt;add funds.<br />The reference number links deposits to your account so you need to make a note of that and give it to the cashier when you make a deposit.<br />They&#039;re pretty quick at crediting your account, usually within 4 hours of deposit. Don&#039;t get overexcited and pay too much for your BTC!

				ok its starting to make sense now,,one other query i got is this<br />once inside a branch of lloyds bank what details do they want from the depositer ? apart from the intersango details do you have to give them any id and a name and address etc etc<br />banks are notoriously intrusive even when depositing small amounts of cash<br />anyone been to lloyds to make a cash deposit to intersango ?

				To withdraw to your wallet: Accounts&gt;Bitcoin (BTC)&gt; Withdraw Bitcoin<br /><br />Yes the bitcoin price fluctuates wildly, buy about 15% more BTC than your item costs to protect yourself. Between June and August last year the price was between something like £18 and £8 and jumped by several pounds a day.<br />It&#039;s nothing like £3.50 at the moment&nbsp; (though I&#039;ll happily sell you plenty of coins @ £3.50&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />There&#039;s currently about 120BTC available between £2.84 - £2.87 on the orderbook.

				Don&#039;t worry goangod, Lloyds don&#039;t want any of your info. Just turn up, write all the account info on a paying in slip, hand over the slip and the cash to the girl behind the counter and you&#039;re done! I paid in cash for the first time today at about 10am, and I had the cash in my Intersango account ready to purchase bitcoins by about 3pm. Definitely faster than Mt Gox.<br />One thing to be careful of though; Lloyds don&#039;t have a space on their paying in slip for a reference. I just wrote it on the slip in an empty space and told the cashier to pay it in with that reference. That needs to be on there, or Intersango won&#039;t know whos account the payment is for.<br />Good luck and happy shopping!

				sorry for sounding like a dumb ass benjy but what do I ask for? do I just ask for a &quot;paying slip&quot; or should I just say I want to put this money into a bank account (and they hand me over a slip?) <br /><br />also does anyone have a site for monitoring bit coin prices and things?

				No problem man! You don&#039;t have to ask for paying in slips, they&#039;re normally kept on a little desk thingy next to where you queue up for the cashiers. Just look for the pens, since they keep them on those little chains the slips can&#039;t be more than a foot away!! But if you can&#039;t find them, just ask the cashier, they&#039;re normally pretty helpful.<br />And I find that the best site for keeping track of BTC prices is mtgox.com. If you go to their webpage and click the grey bar at the top of the screen (the one that says last price, high, low etc), a graph will drop down showing the history of the BTC price, you can zoom in and out etc, it&#039;s pretty good.<br />Hope that helped.

				Yeah, you&#039;ve pretty much got it. Just put in the rate you want to buy the BTC at, and the total amount you wish to purchase. Then your order will be filled, usually within a minute or so. You&#039;ve then got BTC in your Intersango account, which you can transfer to Silk Road.<br />What rate you buy your BTC at is the only tricky bit. I tend to go for the middle of the buys and sells on the book. E.g. right now the highest unfilled bid is £2.86, and the lowest unsold offer is £2.95, so I&#039;d probably try and buy BTC for £2.91.<br />It&#039;s all a bit confusing when you first start, but after a while you get the hang of it. If you need any more help gimme a shout.

You would be the first target. <br /><br />Also the part about commission, how would Intersango make money if they didn&#039;t charge?

				Hi REM + Gustono,<br /><br />I visit the Netherlands around twice a year, and have done for nearly two decades. Needless to say, I send as much back as I can afford! I must&#039;ve had at least 6 or 7 packages stopped at the border over the years. Not a single copper has ever visited me at home. And if they did? so what! Considering the amount, it would be a small fine at most. I can live with that. <br /><br />As for Intersango grassing me up, so what? Again, if I was moving thousands a month through them, then yeah, I would be concerned. But do you really believe the police would invest the technical and logistical manpower for £50 of ganja. Nope. And even if they did, I would get a small fine. Fuck em!<br /><br />Re - Intersango charges: Up until a week ago, it was free to do a UK bank transfer in and out of your a/c and free to trade. Only this last week have they started to charge, and only on the actual trading side (0.65% I think it is). Not sure what the score is for Johnny Foreigner? <br /><br />Again, if you feel that the police would invest the time and resources to get you, then cover your ass good. If the thought of the police confiscating your computer keeps you awake at night, there&#039;s a special place in hell for ya (I&#039;m referring to all the sick fucks that use Tor for more nefarious reasons).<br /><br />And remember this, the more you try and hide your tracks, the more suspicious you look. And given that many of the folks using SR are pretty basic computer users, I doubt many could really cover their tracks properly anyways.<br /><br />

				Has anyone been watching that C4 docu-series &quot;Coppers&quot;?<br /><br />The UK police aren&#039;t exactly known to be cutting edge law enforcement!<br /><br />I do agree that not everyone should be so blase about their anonymity. If my job required a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check, I&#039;d definitely be more concerned. As it goes, I&#039;m self-employed.<br /><br />And if I was a relapsing junkie whose family life required &#039;my dirty little secret&#039; be kept from them, then yeah I&#039;d hide my &#039;tracks&#039; good.

I&#039;ve read a few similar complaints on bitcointalk.org, so I know I&#039;m not alone. Pisses me off that despite having plenty of cash to burn on illicit goodies, it can take easily 24+ hours just to get some coinage, regardless of whether I&#039;ve done a bank transfer or dropped a cash deposit at a Lloyds branch. Paying for drugs in good ol&#039; fashioned £ notes is literally the only thing I miss about traditional drug purchasing. <br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

It would be very annoying if you had to pay a price per bitcoin when you deposited somehow, cause the bitcoin value could go up or down whilst you&#039;re waiting - fortunately you can&#039;t! :)

				I buy btcs with my bank&#039;s bill pay facility online, send the money straight to Intersango. After all, it&#039;s not a crime to buy them, £100 here and there shouldn&#039;t raise any eyebrows - should it?
