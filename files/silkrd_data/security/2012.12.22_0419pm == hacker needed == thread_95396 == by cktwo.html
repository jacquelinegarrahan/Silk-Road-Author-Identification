				ok so i dont know how viable this is. but there are ppl out there offerin hacking services on darknet, dont trust them. but was wondering if a vendor here was able to offer the following hacking service;<br /><br />I work for a national consumer company and i want to be able to get relevant details of the system from accounts. will it be possible for a hacker to do this? they&#039;re not card details and relevant details will be stored in a diff system to the card details. <br /><br />for the right person i can possibly get a link to a web access to the bespoke software they use. where it ask for login details. i can get some user names, i can also get ***XXXX. the stars filled in with relevant details and the XXX&#039;s would be numbers.<br /><br />i am doing this for profit eventually but more so to stick it to the fat consumer bastards ripping of innocent people of their lil money to make big money for themselves. u really dont no how bad they bend their customers over and the poor ppl have no choice but to take it. hurts what these big nationals are doing to albeit the general stupid population but they dont deserve what they get....
