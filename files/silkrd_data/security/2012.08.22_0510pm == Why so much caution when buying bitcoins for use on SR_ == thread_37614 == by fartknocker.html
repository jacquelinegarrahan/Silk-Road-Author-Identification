				I just posted this but it&#039;s removed? If this was removed intentionally please PM me why...<br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering why so many people avoid buying coins on the legit online markets. Bitcoin transactions do not log IP addresses, SR tumbles coins internally, and there is no lasting &#039;proof&#039; that you even did anything illegal on SR so long as you encrypt your addresses when purchasing and keep your login password stored in your head.<br /><br />Just ingeniously curious what the perceived risks are from obtaining coins from Mt Gox etc rather than cash deposits. I fully advocate the cash method too if you can do it where you live -- never good to use an abundance of caution when doing something illegal.<br /><br />Also I kinda think that one of the easiest and &#039;legal&#039; ways to link cash to bitcoin transactions for the police would be to sell them for cash themselves. They always go after the money trail to take down drug operations, so why not sell bitcoins for cash and be the source of the money trail?

				If LE set up a cash for bitcoins type service it would be as hard for them to track where the cash in the post came from as it is for them to track where the drugs come from when they are delivered from a vendor.<br /><br />It is just down to each person’s level of comfort/paranoia. Some people will transfer straight from MtGox to SR, other people will use tumblers like bitcoin fog, and others will want to fund the BTC in a way that bypasses the use of their identifiable information all together.<br /><br />Personally I use an exchange and send it indirectly to SR (so that there is no taint) which is my trade-off between time/loss of coin/laziness and risk.

				Have you considered getting coins from a Silk Road vendor? Some of us deposit your coins directly into your SR account, and in our case, the client remains anonymous. Hard to see how those coins could ever be traced to a physical you.<br /><br />Think Bitinstant, only we think we’re faster and provide a better return.<br /><br />

				i dont really take precautions but understand why they do ,if u just buy coins all the time and never withdraw its obvious u not trading coins and if your thing gets snagged and u deny ordering and they produce your bank statments and youve been buying coins once a week for 6 months and carnt explain were they go its pretty obvious u have been ordering <br />in countries like usa u get time for scoring a .1 on street dont u never mind 10 g international ,if i was in usa id be a lot more careful
