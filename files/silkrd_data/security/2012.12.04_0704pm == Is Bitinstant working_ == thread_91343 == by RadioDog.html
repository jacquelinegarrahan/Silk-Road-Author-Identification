				I get to the screen where I&#039;m supposed to create my payment slip, and I click it and it just sits there forever and doesn&#039;t give me my slip? Is this happening to anyone else?

				All of the computers in my house give me an error when I try to place a bitinstant order. It makes no sense whatsoever especially because I used to place them without any issue. In any event I found a computer elsewhere on a different network that allows me to place them without issue. And in a pinch I can use my phone. <br /><br />However I recently had an issue where there was no record of my transaction at all so I contacted bitinstant support and initially they acted like I was being impatient and had probably screwed something up myself. Well with as many times as I have done this I knew that was not the case and the rep finally told me my transaction had &quot;gotten stuck&quot; in their system and they would expedite the process. Well about six hours late I finally saw movement in the blockchain thank god. <br /><br />If I had to guess bitinstant is experiencing the same problems SR was recently with a rapidly expanding customer base and volume but who knows. I got extremely helpful customer support in the end and while it did take some time and ruin some purchasing plans I trust bitinstant in the end. <br /><br />I could not for the life of me figure out why bitinstant stopped working on my home network but if all else fails try a different computer/network and hopefully that will help. <br /><br />Good luck.

				I used Bitinstant to cash deposit via CVS today with no problem! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91343.msg643805#msg643805">Quote from: RKL on December 05, 2012, 03:28 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ive heard you dont have to use an id when buying coins w bitinstant? they can be bought at 7-11 and walmart? can anyone verify this&nbsp; thxs<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At CVS they have always asked for ID but it is just to make sure the transaction is found correctly.
