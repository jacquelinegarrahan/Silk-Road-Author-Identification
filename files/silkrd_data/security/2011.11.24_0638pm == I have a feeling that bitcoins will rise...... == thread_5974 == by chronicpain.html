				I get this weird feeling that the bitcoin is about to do a small comeback.. This is just a gut feeling, no science behind my feeling whatsoever. Just the way that its acting seems that its going to rise, How much? who knows.. but it will be interesting to see...

				It&#039;s just because it&#039;s a holiday. I highly doubt it&#039;ll go above 2.55 today. It&#039;ll be back down in the 2.20-2.30&#039;s by tomorrow.

				i predicted this when the bitcoin was around 2.30 now its at 2.90 Plus, mt. gox is making a major announcement in the next day or two. they wouldn&#039;t tell me what it was, but I believe you will be able to trade the bitcoin like you can with forex, on margin, etc.. so, I think it will really rise... depending on what mt. gox has up their sleeve. (maybe its when they are going to take everyones money and run, lol...

				Mt Gox are the biggest boys on the block, So, if they do start trading on margin, being able to short the bitcoin, etc. I think it will rise dramatically.

				this thread wasn&#039;t about how great or bad Mt. Gox is. Its a thread about me predicting&nbsp; the price of the bitcoin would rise. It&#039;s now about 3 bucks.. Yes, they were hacked in June. But they have taken many precautions. I purchased the Yubikey, I could post my username and password here and no one could get in. <br /><br />I think the reason they want so much info about someone is because of scams/hacking. If you provide your info it would be hard to get away hacking. I think, right now, the only way you need to provide your personal info is if you want to withdraw more than 1k a day and 10k a month. other than that, its anonymous.<br /><br />Thats why I think the bitcoin is rising, becuase whatever announcement they are making will effect a lot of bitcoin users. Again, Im not pro any bitcoin company, It was a gut feeling that I made a week or so ago, I dont know how this turned into a &quot;How great Mt. gox is thread&quot; Mt. Gox is the biggest bitcoin trader in the world i believe...<br /><br />I know a lot of people that hate them and others that love them. Im in the middle of the road. I haven&#039;t had any issues with them, nor do I use them exclusively...
