				Hi I am a new vendor in SR. One of my clients asked me for my gpg public key. I got so far to create it, but I cannot find out how to read his messages or how to send new ones. Any help please?

For the record, your ostensible buyer cannot send you encrypted messages without your PGP key.&nbsp; Nor can you send encrypted messages to them without their PGP key. <br /><br />Read the documentation at the GPG4USB site: http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank for your answers. But is not nice to say somethning about our professional manners. we are in bussiness for years and package postage etc is in real high level. We are just found out all this with encryption.

				bodyinaction, Nightcrawler wasn&#039;t being rude to you at all. If you look at what he posted , he was offering you some helpful advice. I&#039;m absolutely bewildered to hear you say your operation, which has been running for years, is run professionally when any sensitive information sent to others or received by you, such as an address, has NOT been encrypted. You may run other parts of your business extremely professionally, but protecting the anonymity of both yourself and your customers is paramount. If your security is flawed, your business will fail. Sorry mate, but that&#039;s the reality of the situation IMO.&nbsp; :)

				I didn t say he was rude, I actually thanked him for support. I just cannot understand why nobody really answered my question. Anyway I did it my self , it wasn t that difficult if you actually undersatnd how it works. The only thing somedody could answer me was that to decrypt a message you should import the message to the clipboard and press decrypt.
