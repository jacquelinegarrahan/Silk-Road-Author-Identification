				I started hearing &quot;click&quot; noises when I talk on my cell recently.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think too much of it initially.<br /><br />Today, I was talking to a friend and he jokingly said that he thinks my phone is tapped because he hears &quot;click&quot; noises when he calls me.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a vendor and don&#039;t participate in anything that would draw attention to me.<br /><br />However, I am in a weird situation with someone who has threatened to call the cops on me after series of verbal arguments.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any criminal records but I did make verbal threats to someone after the person tried to scam me.<br /><br />I wonder how likely it is that my phone would be tapped because someone went to the LE to report me.<br /><br />Maybe I watched too many movies... or is it possible for someone to tap my cell line?

				beeps, clicks, and other noises, that are not a normal function of your service ( as in someone with same network and same phone model ) should be a huge key - and the line should be discontinued without notifying your network or anyone that might have been busted and was asked for people involved so they could bust them.

				The days of phone taps making clicks and buzzes ended in the 80s.<br /><br />They don&#039;t hook up wires to your line anymore, they just tell the computer that routes your conversation to record a copy. You will have zero indication. It is more likely radio interference.

The video is over 50 minutes long and a bit complicated, but explaining how to tap a cell phone is not simple. I appreciate you asking for a source, so much of what is said here is utter bullshit.<br /><br />Burner phones are limited security at best. They are about as secure as talking on this forum, you can hide your identity but they can still listen in.<br /><br />What the video describes is the hard way to do it. If you have a warrant they just flick a switch and it is tapped. You see every conversation is handled by a computer, and the software that handles the conversation has the option to record it if it is asked to do so.<br /><br />So while legitimate taps can simply ask for a recording anyone who is willing to circumvent the law can also do it themselves without any outside help. Use a computer with GPG to talk, it is not as convenient but it is damn secure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=64621.msg562417#msg562417">Quote from: paxpax on November 02, 2012, 05:20 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...Cell taps are very easy to get.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yup, and all they have to do is add a number to a list and they get real time recordings. They have automated it so it is as easy as asking.<br /><br />To the OP: Yes your phone may be easily tapped if they have even flimsy justification, no the clicking has nothing to do with it.

				Oh the memories of phone phreaking.&nbsp; Beize boxes ftw&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously though, if someone has the ability to tap your line today you won&#039;t hear anything, back in the 80&#039;s you could record the clicks made through the op line on a payphone onto an audio cassete, and just replay the series of clicks/beeps you recorded on the payphone to get free phone calls ... but that was a long long time ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />What you&#039;re hearing is likely just EMI.

				Just for everyone&#039;s information, you must remember that all a cell phone is. is a big radio. It is LEO&#039;s biggest friend next to a snitch. As stated in previous posts, it&#039;s not that hard to listen in, legally or illegally. If you are in the bizness, your best friend is a cheap burner phone. One that doesn&#039;t have the capability for them to back track your movements by GPS or some of the other capabilities built in to phones today. Get a cheap phone, pay cash for it. and shut it off when your not using it!

				I&#039;m not sure about how audio tapping is done by the US gov but it&#039;s been known for a while that they collect all the texts and metadata (who called who and for how long) from every phone in the US and certainly international calls. <br />-Clearnet- https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying&nbsp; &nbsp;has a good article on it saying &quot;The undisputed documents show that AT&amp;T installed a fiberoptic splitter at its facility at 611 Folsom Street in San Francisco that makes copies of all emails web browsing and other Internet traffic to and from AT&amp;T customers and provides those copies to the NSA.&quot; and it certainly is not just AT&amp;T, they just had the first whistleblower.

				How can you get a encrypted phone? There must be a way to get around it. And how long until they tap a burner phone. if you change the number every 5 weeks. or what a about a app that disguises the voice so even if you did get recorded be really hard to prove in court that it was you if you change your voice.

				zrtp for voip is supported by jitsi from jitsi.org<br /><br />you can run it on a nokia n900 or other such device, but it would only be secure when calling someone similarly equipped.&nbsp; a netbook with a usb headset is another hardware option.&nbsp; also, you&#039;d need to run an asterisk server on a hacked box in russia or something if you wanted to eliminate the server logs (otherwise, any free sip account would do). <br /><br />yet another option might be an openmoko neo freerunner running twinkle (which also supports zrtp).&nbsp; but the only distributor i can find for that phone on my continent is only selling them in packs of 10, and i don&#039;t know if i could resell them.&nbsp; maybe a vendor opportunity?<br /><br />iphones are right out, since they upload their imei number and location data to the nearest cell tower even with no sim card inserted.&nbsp; shady!<br />

				As other posters noted, modern phone &quot;taps&quot; will not produce anything audible on the target. They use (in the US) the CALEA system, entirely software-based, packet-switched. Neither will a DNR/pen register produce any audible signal.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking into listing some hardware encryption (AES 256-bit) modules for GSM cell phones and also some encrypted two-way radios (same thing, AES 256). Neither device would be cheap. Probably in the $500 - $1000/unit range. I haven&#039;t picked them up yet because I&#039;m unsure of the demand at that price point. Is there any interest?

				Yes, correct, modern TAPs (or better known as LI&#039;s [lawful intercepts] that&#039;s irony.) are all electronic and based on packet switched data. Your data/voice stream is simply mirrored to a server with time/date stamps where the agency requesting it can download it at will. <br /><br />Same way they handle data/Internet intercepts, data is mirrored, you won&#039;t notice.<br /><br />** Cell phone&#039;s are incredibly dangerous to your freedom.&nbsp; **<br /><br />That being said, iPhone would be the #1 danger, android based phones your #2 danger and all other smartphones fall in line behind that. The less features your phone has, and the dumber, the safer, but no way safe.<br /><br />It&#039;s all risk/reward and risk mitigation. <br /><br />Getting police called on you for anything is not a good idea. resolve your issue in another way....

				It&#039;s actually the theme song to the flawless HBO drama &#039;the wire&#039; which is a show that includes a lot of drug dealers getting their phones tapped<br /><br />No one got the reference though&nbsp; :-[

				Nowadays what does everyone always have on or near them at all times, a cell phone. Anyone including LE can tap your cell, listen in when your cells off via speaker, even watch you via your cell cam not to mention track you. Change your cell VPN, tape over your camera, and dont leave your cell anywhere with a good listening post. Always put ur cell away, my cell got hacked once and I know this. Its better to use 10 dollar burn phones preloaded with mins, avoid smart phones.

				Use the redphone app in google play to talk to your associates, tell them to get a cheap Nexus S on craigslist and you can build AOSP yourself, removing GPS/Camera/NFC/Wifi and securing it. Then use redphone and textsecure with each other<br /><br />

				You will never know if your mobile is tapped. Only when you will be busted (if they find evidence of illegal....).<br />The technology is so advanced now....wow!!!!<br />They can listen to your conversations, also if you are not make a conversation on the phone!!<br />They can listen any time!! The important is that the battery is on. And they hear in abt. 5m radius!! And also the camera is working, and also the GPS is working (dont mater if you have it on &#039;&#039;off&#039;&#039;)!!<br />The only secure way is to put the battery out, and wait 10-30 min (depends of the model of the phone). Because all the new mobile have an extra small battery inside!!! <br /><br />For business, NEVER have a mobile with you!!! This is one of the basic rules!!!<br />

				I&#039;ve had an issue with my phone making weird noises like clicks and I&#039;ve noticed a sound like someone picking a phone up, that happens when I call someone, while there phone is still ringing and they have yet to pick up.<br />I also have noticed that when I&#039;m discussing things not drug related I tend to hear a sound like someone hanging up, but when I discuss drugs this sound is never heard.

				You need to root your cell, delete all the factory apps an programs. Change your VPN, firewall your bluetooth, cover your camera, encrypt call logs, contacts, all texts. Not too much can be done once your cells already tapped, I recommend getting a new cell. The LE can clone your cell since cells became popular, if ur ever arrested throw that cell away. LE uses a hotbox that will log everything off your cell, even erased call logs an texts are never actually erased. Use cheap burn phones with mins, throw away when mins are up, never carry your cell when doing something dirty LE can listen to you through your speaker as well as watch you through your camera. Any hacker knows this and LE is very good at hacking via access to any cell company ect.

				ORBOT on your phone is not the best idea. I wouldn&#039;t want tor traffic on a device that can transmit my location.
