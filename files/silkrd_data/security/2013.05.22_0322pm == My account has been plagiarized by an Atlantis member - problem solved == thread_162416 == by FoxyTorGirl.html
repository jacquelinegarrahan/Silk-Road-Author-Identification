				I just found out that someone on Atlantis just posted a lot of my items with my pictures and descriptions, Should I do something, or just forget about it since Atlantis is useless anyways?

				I don&#039;t know how the thing works on Atlantis but you can try to contact them to see if there&#039;s something you can do about it.<br /><br />I would not have high hopes but maybe they are interested themselves there to keep away these sort of people, who knows (if they are serious they should).

				You could send your customers a warning on your SR profile and forum thread, and remind them to always verify your identity on other web sites by requesting a PGP signed message.<br /><br />Other than that, there&#039;s not much you can do except ask the admin to give you the account or ban the impostor.<br />

				You know, it&#039;s probably a good idea for vendors to squat their account names on these other markets, even if they never use them.<br />

				+1 to astor for that, potential scammers do squat accounts of successful vendors on other sites so something to think about all other vendors here on SR.<br /><br />Another thing I have mentioned to many people, watermark your pictures, if you have to write/print on a piece of paper your username and maybe date and place product right on top of it, it will make those wanting to fuck around a difficult job thus moving on to the next one.

				I actually don&#039;t care about the pictures, or even the descriptions, anybody wanting to use them, be my guest, I just don&#039;t feel comfortable with the fact that someone pretending to be me, seems really unsafe, I am just wondering, how are they planning to scam, my guess is they are going to ask to FE or even worse, maybe that&#039;s not a scammer, maybe somebody trying to snoop out information...?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162416.msg1159612#msg1159612">Quote from: Meerkovo on May 24, 2013, 02:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">+1 to astor for that, potential scammers do squat accounts of successful vendors on other sites so something to think about all other vendors here on SR.<br /><br />Another thing I have mentioned to many people, watermark your pictures, if you have to write/print on a piece of paper your username and maybe date and place product right on top of it, it will make those wanting to fuck around a difficult job thus moving on to the next one. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />if I watermark my pictures, I write &quot;FoxyGirl&quot; - but that is what they pretend to be, they also say they are the &quot;FoxyGirl&quot; from SR, so any watermark on the pictures will still support their account.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162416.msg1161323#msg1161323">Quote from: railroadbill on May 24, 2013, 09:59 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">that sucks, good luck to dem scammers, you should register your name with the trademark office<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />got a meeting with them next Monday, FoxyGirl from SR is going public, I&#039;m going to sue anybody using that name lol&nbsp; ;D

				Black Market Reloaded has a Silk Road verification system to ensure your the same vendor with the same name. On BMR you send the OP (backopy) a message with your account. They then send you a coded message here on Silk Road (yes, BMR has an account on SR), you then verify that coded message back on BMR, and then you get a little Silk Road green camel icon on your account at BMR. You can see that at this link<br /><br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=viewUser&amp;id=166446<br /><br />a couple of month ago Atlantis was offering free vendor accounts to established Silk Road vendors. They should do the same thing that BMR does with verification and people should demand it if they&#039;re going to try and pilfer vendors from here<br /><br />I signed up at Atlantis, but never actually made a vendor listing there, but &#039;cyanspore&#039; name is tied up at least. I don&#039;t need to make a third listing. I get more than enough business here and BMR
