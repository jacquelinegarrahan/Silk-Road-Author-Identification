				Apologies if this is an FAQ. I&#039;ve searched the forum, links below to the threads I read.<br /><br />I am new to Silk Road and eager to get started. BitInstant cash deposits seem like a good way to get Bitcoin.<br /><br />However I cannot find any indication of whether ID is required for these deposits. The BitInstant web site does not say, I&#039;ve done numerous searches, and I&#039;ve read several guides in this forum. None of them say whether ID is required.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see the point in doing the cash deposits if any sort of identification is required. If that&#039;s the case, I might as well just buy Bitcoin with my debit card.<br /><br />Thanks for any help! Here are the threads I&#039;ve already read:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.msg408015#msg408015<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35761.msg408625#msg408625<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32694.msg371723#msg371723<br /><br />and even more...

				I have used Bitinstant for all my BTC purchases...they are a great service with great support. (My first purchase they FUBAR&#039;d but got it handled very quickly)<br /><br />This is what I do to get BTC anonymously: <br /><br />Go to my bank or an ATM and get cash out.<br />Go to any MoneyGram location (Wal-Mart, 7-11, etc) and fill out the Blue MoneyGram sheet with fake personal info.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally always used Wal-Mart...<br />Pay the attendant. (They should not ask to see any ID, if they do go somewhere else)<br />Get your receipt and walk out.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried depositing at one of their bank locations, not worth the trouble and anxiety to me...<br />I&#039;ve personally never had to show ID to deposit money in an account at a bank, but I can guarantee not all work that way.<br />Quick googling shows mixed responses on BoA requiring ID to deposit, so I wouldn&#039;t even try.<br /><br />Even though buying BTC is not illegal, it would still irk me to do the transaction in a bank setting, ESPECIALLY if I had to show ID!<br /><br />Now of course people could argue about the anonymity of this method.. (the bank has cameras and timestamp of the transaction, the MoneyGram stores have cameras and timestamp of transactions)<br />In that case, I&#039;d just hope to find someone locally (https://localbitcoins.com/) you could meet IRL and buy BTC from them directly in person with cash at a random place with wifi access...<br /><br />â˜®

				No ID required. If someone asks for it, refuse and leave. <br /><br /><br />I assume you are talking about bank deposits (BoA/WellsFargo)<br /><br /><br />If you give me YOUR BoA account number. I can go to ANY BoA and deposit $ into your accnt. No ID. <br /><br /><br />.... This is the same thing. You are just making a deposit in their accnt.

				Thanks gospodin. But I&#039;m talking about people like me, who have never tried this before. My first question when I was going through the process on Bitinstant was, &quot;Am I going to be asked for ID at any point in this process?&quot;<br /><br />From what you guys say, I believe that I will be fine. But the Bitinstant site doesn&#039;t say anything about this! I could only assume that they didn&#039;t mention it because they did require ID, and didn&#039;t want to scare users away<br /><br />But alas! Sounds like I was wrong

				I was nervous about this too - and stubbornly sticking to the Dwolla-&gt;Gox method - even gave Dwolla my SS - but the final straw was last time I tried to use them (I was gonna use Dwolla -&gt; Bitinstant) - they decided we needed to know each other EVEN MORE , and requested a .jpg scan of my drivers license.&nbsp; Enough is enough!<br /><br />Bitinstant couldn&#039;t be easier, and no you won&#039;t need ID - here&#039;s how you do it<br /><br />1) Go to the site, pick &quot;Cash Deposit - Other&quot; as the source, and whatever you like as the destination - you just use a one-off e-mail address, or a bitcoin address (Wouldn&#039;t recommend going direct to your SR wallet though)<br /><br />2) At this point, you&#039;ll be asked for your zip (you can use a nearby zip code), and given a list of nearby locations you can make your payment at.&nbsp; Some use the Moneygram system, and some use a system called Softgate.&nbsp; Pick a Softgate location.&nbsp; These are mostly small, independent corner store type places<br /><br />3) You&#039;re given a form to print out, which you can if you like, but I didn&#039;t bother.&nbsp; The only info you really need to bring with you is the name of the company you are paying (forget the exact name of the site cashpay.com or something like that) and an account number.&nbsp; There&#039;s also a support phone number if you or the cashier need it.&nbsp; The form will even list two more nearby locations you can use if there&#039;s trouble at the first as well.<br /><br />4) Went to the store , told the guy I needed to pay a bill.&nbsp; He took me to a separate window, and was obviously confused - english wasn&#039;t his first language.&nbsp; Thought it wasn&#039;t gonna work - he said &quot;we no pay bill for this company, we pay electric, gas, not this!&quot;.&nbsp; Told him the website told me this specific location, and repeated the site, guy said he couldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; As I was leaving, he said &quot;hey wait! i see it!&quot; , put in the account number, asked how much I wanted to pay, gave him the money, got a receipt, and left.&nbsp; No form to fill out, didn&#039;t even ask my name let alone ask for ID.&nbsp; Had the coins in a half hour.<br /><br />Super easy.&nbsp; Don&#039;t mistake a cashier&#039;s confusion as them being suspicious as to what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; You&#039;re paying a bill, and thats all you need to tell them.&nbsp; They probably just don&#039;t have a lot of people paying bills for this particular company and may be unfamiliar how to do it.&nbsp; If for some reason, they can&#039;t/won&#039;t do it, or ask for ID - just say you don&#039;t have your ID - and hit up one of the other locations - you have 3 days to make the payment.

				I&#039;m a bit biased as the bitcoin scene is still relatively new to me. As a result the only service I&#039;ve tried to get coin is BitInstant-&gt;Wallet address. Works like a charm, reasonable fee, easy cash transactions. Out of 3 runs I was asked for ID at CVS twice, but just say you forgot it and are unaware it&#039;s necessary. Seems like not too many cashiers are used to bills being paid this way but it&#039;ll be faster than the other methods. Plus once cash changes hand the coins arrive in minutes or less, damn quick<br /><br />Good luck

				I also wrote this like 10 days ago. It was already 3 pages back, but it also is a step by step method to using bitinstant.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0<br /><br />Lets not forget that buying bitcoins is totally legal. It only feels &quot;dirty&quot; to you. ;)<br /><br />I dabbled in the coin during its inception, but lacked the foresight to see anything like this come of it. So I was pretty much already comfortable with buying coins.<br /><br />Everyone go out to clear webs and do something legal with a few coins, you will feel a whole lot better about it afterwards.<br /><br /><br />That of course is not meant to imply that you intended anything &quot;illegal&quot; with your coins of course.<br />

				Also like Shroom pointed out - not only is buying bitcoins legal - but whoever you are paying will have no idea you are buying bitcoins.&nbsp; The company you are actually paying handles payments for dozens of legitimate businesses (mainly online-type gaming sites), Bitinstant just happens to be one of their clients. <br /><br />Between the post I made earlier, and the post Shroom linked to, you should have all the information you need.&nbsp; Personally, I feel more comfortable just using a small corner store that handles bill payment versus a bank...the whole idea of going into a bank just makes me kinda nervous, but that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the store gets part of the 3.95 fee you&#039;re paying for facilitating the process - now that the clerk there knows how to do it, I&#039;m sure he wouldn&#039;t mind if I went there to pay my bills all the time.

				I&#039;ve done a cash deposit at CVS 4 times. The last time, the clerk asked me for ID. I started acting all annoyed and said that I had come here multiple times to pay bills and never had to show an ID. Another clerk who had seen me before confirmed this and let the transaction go through. I hope they don&#039;t put up a fuss when I go back again...

				Totally understood guys, and thanks all again. I didn&#039;t expect this forum to be so active, it&#039;s great<br /><br />I know that buying Bitcoin is legal and can be used for legal purchases, but I still don&#039;t want my identity tied to my Bitcoin in any way, shape, or form. Just a personal preference.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to know now that it&#039;s so easy! Only thing left is for me to give it a try, which I plan to do just hours from now.<br /><br />Thanks again

				I recently experimented with several different locations to purchase btc using bitinstant. What I can tell you as pure fact is that every purchase /transfer that I made required me to provide my I.D. regardless of the amount. 2 CVS, 2 wally worlds, and 3 different cash advance locations... all in various amounts. Just wanted to put it out there that it seems like policies are starting to change.

				Just wanted to hop in the thread to say that I just did my first bitinstant cash deposit this afternoon at Walmart and it went very, very smoothly.&nbsp; Granted, I&#039;m still waiting for my BTC wallet to show the transaction, but the actual process at Walmart went without a hitch.&nbsp; I went to a large, newish Walmart which is ALWAYS packed.&nbsp; I figured people working in the banking/moneygram area would be very accustomed to completing all kinds of transactions, and therefore would be good as far as ease of getting it done quickly.&nbsp; I was wrong -- the guy took one look at my zipzap paper and said he had never heard of it or seen one of those forms before.&nbsp; I told him it was a moneygram type thing (what the hell do i know!) and eventually he understood.<br /><br />He then pointed me toward the turquoise/blue moneygram payment forms.&nbsp; I filled one out with a fake name &amp; number.&nbsp; He told me I needed to put my address as well, so I made one up on the spot.&nbsp; Then I signed the blue form, handed it back to him, he input everything into his computer, took my cash, gave me my change, and printed my receipt.&nbsp; Signed my receipt with my fake name and was done.<br /><br />Then I bought some Funyuns.<br /><br />Anyway ... he never requested an ID.

				You guys are taking the hard way to deposit cash with bitinstant or get-bitcoin.com. You know you can just deposit cash at many bank locations AND you can just run in, grab a deposit slip, enter the account #, state of business, amount and then just go to the drive thru(less than five minutes). I have done this dozens of times. No ID, no questions asked, NO SKETCHINESS, and you have bitcoins in minutes. They may even give you a lollipop when your done at the bank. This also so much cheaper and faster than moneypak vendors on sr. Good luck!!

				I just go to a CVS close by my place. The first two or three times, they never asked, but I went again and it was a different employee and they asked for ID. Just refused and left. Went a different time and they didn&#039;t ask. So most of the time, it just depends on the employee. They need your ID because they see which transactions are available to be paid at that specific store, and chances are you&#039;re the only person paying with MoneyGram lately, so they don&#039;t need an ID for that if you just tell them the name you used for MoneyGram. Oh, I forgot to mention, this is if you have to use the MoneyGram phone there, not the slips you fill out.<br /><br />I might just go to the bank from now on, I&#039;m actually surprised they don&#039;t ask for your ID yet MoneyGram does.

				i think most of these seasoned SR veterans recommend not using a tormail account for the bitinstant thing, and instead using mailinator.com because it&#039;s a bit less suspicious.&nbsp; i could be wrong - just passing on what i&#039;ve read here in other threads.

				I have to comment on this ID stuff.&nbsp; Please realize that many citizens (especially lowly employees of a big corporation) are trained from birth that Government is God and that ID needs to be shown for EVERYTHING.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a religion... most people laugh it off, but some people are very well-behaved children who will not question illogical authority, but attempt to enforce it.<br /><br />So there&#039;s no need to fear them or be hostile towards them.&nbsp; They are lowly employees who have no authority over you.&nbsp; Bricks in the wall.&nbsp; So here&#039;s how I handle it.<br /><br />Clerk: (calmly) Alright, I&#039;ll just need to see some ID please.<br />Me: (even calmer) Actually ID is not required for this transaction, and if you request any of my private information again I will inform your supervisor before notifying the FBI that there is a store clerk possibly engaged in Identity Theft.<br /><br />Usually they just freak out and complete the transaction, sometimes they will ask another employee to help, or even request a supervisor themselves.&nbsp; It&#039;s always best to go up-the-chain because usually the supervisor apologizes for the lack of training of the clerk and the next time I arrive there is no ID questions at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about educating them in a professional manner.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also witnessed Police Officers successfully sued by a citizen for aggressively requesting ID.&nbsp; Everyone should have a lawyer and a business card of your local Internal Affairs organization.&nbsp; (Yes, don&#039;t forget - there is a LEO dedicated to your safety against corrupt LEO)<br /><br />A bit off topic, I know, but the whole &quot;let&#039;s see some ID&quot; thing will only go as far as citizens allow it.&nbsp; If we allow it, it&#039;ll become law.&nbsp; (REAL ID act).

				I made my 5th bitinstant deposit at CVS a few days ago. The clerk didn&#039;t ask for my ID, but she already knew me from doing a previous bitinstant deposit (and she didn&#039;t ID me that time, either). So out of the 5 bitinstant deposits at CVS, I only had one with a clerk who asked for ID (and when she did, I got all annoyed and said I had done it many times without ID, another employee came over and vouched for me, and she finally let me do it without ID). <br /><br />When she asked, though, she said the screen told her to check my ID. She didn&#039;t seem like a nosy person or someone who is really into &quot;going by the book&quot; though, she seemed like your typical bored and indifferent employee. So I think the screen really did say to show ID and she was just reading what she saw. That makes me wonder if all the other times, the screen asked for me to show ID and the clerks just never bothered to ask me, or if bitinstant/zipzap moneygram transactions are randomly flagged for ID showing.
