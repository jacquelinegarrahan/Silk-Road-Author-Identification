				With the most recent news, where does one go now for tor-friendly e-mail services?

				Also could use some direction here. Obviously, hushmail is a no, tormail is now apparently gone. Any web-based email services that require Tor to operate? Would a gmail account coupled with GPG operated only when running Tor provide an equitable amount of anonymity?<br /><br />Do any of us truly even know anymore (in light of recent NSA whistleblower discoveries)? Feeling more &quot;Tin Hat&quot;-ish by the day.<br /><br />- eb&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Bitmessages or I2p-Bote mail. Or Privatdemail.net (no .onion server though, also Egypt server.. can&#039;t email Israel or receive emails from Israel)<br /><br />If you want to be ballin&#039; anon then use a nym server with a newsgroup in the reply block http://security.resist.ca/create-nym.shtml for decentralized anonymous retrieval. Rent a cheap VPS with bitcoins to download alt.anonymous.messages and ssh into it over Tor using passwordless keys for retrieval. Can even run your own tor hidden service to retrieve messages. <br /><br />If you read the excellent book &quot;SSH Mastery&quot; by Michael Lucas you can automate this

				I thought you wanted snitch proof email service for dealing. For localbitcoins https://www.vmail.me/en/ will work fine. They are in Netherlands, subject to EU data retention laws but at least aren&#039;t as easily accessible as Gmail or Yahoo by NSA metadata snoopwarez and FBI.<br /><br />Also this: http://www.fepg.net/foreign.html which is a list of all free foreign providers<br /><br />Don&#039;t use any of these free services for drug dealing, and don&#039;t use Countermail either. All of them will close accounts if one of your insane competitors or crackhead customers complains you are using it for illegal activity.
