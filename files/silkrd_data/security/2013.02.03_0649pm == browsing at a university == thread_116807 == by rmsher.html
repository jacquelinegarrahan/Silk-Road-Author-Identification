				I&#039;m currently running TOR on an encrypted USB drive<br /><br />I recently started attending a university and was forced to accept their internet policy where i had to give them an E-signature in order to us their wifi.<br /><br />My question: would it be safe to use TOR on their wifi? I know their strict on things like piracy but would they have any way of knowing I was using TOR from MY computer?

				what OS are you using? if you&#039;re already running tor on an encrypted USB drive, you might as well install tails.. which has TOR and a PGP program built-in. i don&#039;t think you&#039;d leave much of a trail for them in that case.

				They can see that you re using tor, if they re looking for it. But they can&#039;t see what you do with it.<br />You can use a bridge to hide that you are on tor, if you think it&#039;s necessary.

Go to https://bridges.torproject.org and solve the captcha. You&#039;ll be given 2 &lt;ip address&gt;:&lt;port&gt; combos.<br /><br />Go to onion icon -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network.<br /><br />Click &quot;My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network&quot;. This has the effect of putting UseBridges 1 in your torrc config file.<br /><br />Then copy the first &lt;ip address&gt;:&lt;port&gt; (without the word &quot;bridge&quot;) into the field below Add Bridge. Click the plus sign and it will be added to the list. Copy the second &lt;ip address&gt;:&lt;port&gt; into the field and click plus again.<br /><br />Congrats, you&#039;re using bridges.

				It depends on how their network is configured.<br /><br />If they are looking for people connecting to public tor relays, using a bridge will hide your tor activity. I doubt this is the case though. It&#039;s far more likely that a university will use traffic shaping appliances that detect various protocols via DPI. In that case, you would need something like obfusproxy to really hide your tor usage. <br /><br />In any case, it seems unlikely that a university will actually care that you use tor, especially since it takes up less bandwidth than regular internet use and they can&#039;t tell what you&#039;re using it for anyway.

Once the bridge community feature set is released with the ability to run your own bridge directory authorities, I&#039;m running, like, a hundred relays.<br /><br />Catch this fox if you can!
