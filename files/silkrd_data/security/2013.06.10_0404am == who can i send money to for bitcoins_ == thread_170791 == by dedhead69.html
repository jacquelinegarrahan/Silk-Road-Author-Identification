				Like I said before, IF you&#039;ll notice there&#039;s around two other threads asking the same question within the first two pages of the forum. Also search function. Good job on the unnecessary thread.

				Maybe you can find someone in your area who&#039;s willing to trade cash for bitcoins?<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />Might be a bit safer than sending your money to a stranger and hoping he&#039;ll send you back some coins. ;)

				On SR, look at the category = Money<br /><br />JumboMonkeyBiscuit looks very legit. Any of them can go rogue at any moment though.

				NW Nugz, I was looking at other threads about this and saw a few vendors.&nbsp; Sweet!&nbsp; Its costing mad money to do this compared to the 4.95 that Blockchain charged... But whatever, localbitcoins is too complicated for me...<br /><br />+1 for ya

On SR, with no escrow protection for cash to Btc deals, robbery seems as likely to me. It is all (even Gox and such) kinda risky though.<br />

				Moneyhoney put a listing back up.&nbsp; I went to walmart today, put a couple hundred dollars on the moneypak, went home, and placed an order for moneyhoney.&nbsp; Instead of entering my home address, as one would when purchasing something, I just put the number in the back of the card.&nbsp; So now Im waiting for Moneyhoney to transfer me over my spending joy!<br /><br />By the way, moneyhoney charges 12% of what you want.&nbsp; Which i think is worth it considering localbitcoins is like alien brain surgery to me.&nbsp; Good luck and happy buying!
