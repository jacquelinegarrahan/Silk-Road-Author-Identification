				Probably a dumb question, but w/e. i&#039;m pretty new, and that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been doing so farâ€”I thought that if I ordered multiple items at once and one ended up getting seized, it could mean trouble if more were already on the way. But am I just being silly/paranoid?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Edit: On second thought this probably should&#039;ve gone into the Shipping section. My bad.

				Depends, if it&#039;s domestic then it doesn&#039;t matter a great deal... however having multiple items shipped from different countries would be quite risky in comparison. Domestic or not, I try to stick to one order at a time. Sometimes being paranoid is a good idea with these sorta things.

				I&#039;ve had multiple orders show up in my mailbox at once<br />if you can, it&#039;s always safer to &#039;space out&#039; the shipments

				I assume it would be safer always check your mail when it arrives that it has not been pre-opened LE can open mail and start seein what comes to you and start to build a case, or just wait til you got a bigger order comin. At least 1 package at a time is less stress, but more waitin. Just use common sense

				My friend gets his orders delivered to my place, and we&#039;ve had orders come in close to and on the same day multiple times with no issue. As long as the packages look legit, and of course it helps if they&#039;re domestic, I wouldn&#039;t be worried. Some people have a lot of friends, and get packages (read: innocuous gifts) from friends and order packages (again, gifts) for friends.<br /><br />I still wouldn&#039;t advise a steady stream of multiple packages a week. No no no.
