				So for those that are not up to speed about what Rasberry Pi is check out this link<br /><br />CLEARNET: http://www.raspberrypi.org/about<br /><br />It is basically a turbo cheap computer that runs on linux.<br /><br />A company combined it with Tor to make Onion Pi<br /><br />CLEARNET: http://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview<br /><br />&quot;Using it is easy-as-pie. First, plug the Ethernet cable into any Internet provider in your home, work, hotel or conference/event. Next, power up the Pi with the micro USB cable to your laptop or to the wall adapter. The Pi will boot up and create a new secure wireless access point called Onion Pi. Connecting to that access point will automatically route any web browsing from your computer through the anonymizing Tor network.&quot;<br /><br /><br />I am contemplating using it but would like to hear what more technologically competent people have to say about this?<br /><br />My initial though is that it would awesome to use as sort of Tails device (though you would just install Tor Bundle on an SD card in this case). <br /><br />It is super small, like less than an iPhone and light. and in the even of an emergency ALL you have to do is destroy the SD card. Seems really emergency friendly to me.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				This is basically an anonymizing middle box that provides physical isolation of Tor, the strongest protection available.<br /><br />It definitely looks promising, but have you read the setup instructions? It isn&#039;t a preconfigured device. You will have to install Debian (technically a spin called Raspbian) and Tor, and manually setup iptables rules. If you are ready to do that, then go for it and let us know how it works. :)<br /><br />Keep in mind that there are many ways to deanonymize yourself besides IP leaks. You should still use the browser bundle with the transparent proxy settings.<br />

				And disable automatic updates, if you are proxying Windows through that thing.

				Pretty much what Astor said, sounds like physical isolation, should be great for security from haxx0rz and such deanonymizing you.

				Selling preconfigured Onion Pi&#039;s sounds like a vendor opportunity. ;)<br /><br />This makes using an anon middle box easier because you can switch the wifi AP that you connect to in order to Torify your main box. Obviously that&#039;s not the safest setup, if you have sensitive files on your computer. Also, an attacker who gains access to your system can connect to the non-Torified router, but it&#039;s much safer than TBB on Tor. I would still run Linux in a VM and perform all Tor activities in that. In fact, you can bridge a VirtualBox VM directly to a specific device, like this Onion Pi, so you could do non-Tor stuff on the host, and physically/virtually isolated Tor stuff through the VB VM - Onion Pi.<br /><br />Hmmm, a preconfigured VirtualBox appliance to use with the Onion Pi would be a nice second listing... :)<br /><br /><br />

				Actually, the Raspberry Pi that they recommend is $90. You could accomplish the same thing (anon middle box) with a much cheaper router. If you look at the Github page for PORTAL:<br /><br />https://github.com/grugq/portal<br /><br />It lists some recommended routers that are in the $20-$50 range.<br /><br />Other advantage may include that it&#039;s easier to setup and probably more secure. thegrugq is highly respected in security circles. You should prefer solutions that are made by people who know what they are doing. :)<br />

				I&#039;m buying a Raspberry PI model B soon to play around with it. First test configuration will be a Tor gateway to connect with my laptop via wifi, and add some remote desktop to it.<br />If anyone needs help with the PI I&#039;m willing to give instructions.

				I&#039;ve had a Pi for ages, but hadn&#039;t thought of doing anything Tor-related with it. It&#039;s a very acceptable media streamer (Openelec), plugged into my TV at the moment.
