				Hey guys...So I been out of the loop for a month or two and missed the whole roller coaster with BC...I saw that shit to climb and backed away slowly waited for everythign to level out. <br /><br />Anyways so my main BC provider is done for and no longer taking orders so I been tryign to find a new route. Thus so far I found:<br /><br />1)bitcopia : seems legit good reviews (im on the site and assume the actual order form is only available during business hours)<br /><br />2)Bitinstant: Seems like people have been getting ripped off here so maybe not.....IDK<br /><br />3)Bitfloor.....oh wait nvm they shut down<br /><br />4) Blue Sky traders: They also seem pretty legit based on forum talk but the site is down atm is this a long term thing? <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping to make a few deposits tomr and wanna see what would be the least painless I live by a BOA a Chase WU etc etc so I have access to almost anything needed.&nbsp; Am I missing any other options?<br /><br />Thanks

I never had an issue the 2 times I used them but that was a long long time ago.

				How are you using bitinstant.&nbsp; Are you in the US and are you using TOR?&nbsp; When I go to the website I only have stamp&gt;coin options, looking for cash&gt;coin option.<br /><br />When I try to do it through blockchain it just churns and churns, I don&#039;t get the &#039;create payment&#039; option
