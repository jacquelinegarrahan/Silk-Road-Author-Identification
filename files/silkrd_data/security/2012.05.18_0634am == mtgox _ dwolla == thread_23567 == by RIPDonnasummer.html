				So what is the problem with mtgox and dwolla? does it not take warrants and such to access that info? that seems like it would be pretty difficult to obtain just for the hell of it? Can someone please explain further?<br /><br />So if I have used mtgox and dwolla I might as well burn my computer as I am screwed ?

				Dwolla takes forever to transfer funds now and they require more identification which compromises security (this is a big problem for a lot of people)<br /><br />Mtgox isn&#039;t afraid to work with LE so they&#039;ll hand over your information within a heartbeat if they are asked and they also could require identification at any time while locking your funds.<br /><br />There are plenty of alternatives that are faster and safer which is why people tend to avoid dwolla/mtgox.

				I think Delta11 forgot to put in there, but not always as cheap or convenient as Dwolla/MtGox.<br /><br />The problem is those things generally are contrary to security.&nbsp; The more secure the more expensive and or inconvenient.

				Not to jack the OPs thread, but wanted to ask if it would be worthwhile to cancel or close an account that I set up on Dwolla before I did a lot of home work on the forums?<br /><br />Or is it basically a moot point once they have bank account information?&nbsp; Just never use them again?<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I am just trying to figure all this out. MTGOX is a japanese company. Its not like the DEA is going to call them up and ask for everyones information that has sent BC to SR and they are just going to hand it over like that. <br /><br />Furthermore, what is the point of the bitcoin address. I thought once you sent to an address is went away forever and could not be traced. <br /><br />regardless I am closing my mtgox account and dwolla and going other methods as I am pretty much freaked the hell out.
