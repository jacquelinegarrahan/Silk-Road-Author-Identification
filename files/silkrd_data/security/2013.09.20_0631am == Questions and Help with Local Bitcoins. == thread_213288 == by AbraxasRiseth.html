				Hey Guys, <br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking a lot of threads lately about localbitcoins, it appears to have the most positive reviews and recommendations of any source for BTC. I decided I&#039;m definitely going to use it, but the thing is I&#039;ve never bought bitcoins before and haven&#039;t been able to make a purchase on SR yet, so I have some questions about it all. I just got a job last month after being unemployed since I&#039;ve been lurking. I don&#039;t have much and I&#039;m way eager to give the Road a formal try finally. <br /><br />Here are my questions and concerns: How much should I look at making for my first trade? I&#039;m thinking I want to do $150-200. That&#039;s all I can afford and that&#039;s about as much as I want to spend on the road right now anyways. I&#039;m only looking to buy weed. I&#039;ve read people doing $20, $50 and then $100 trades first. But that seems like it might take a while, safer, yes but more tedious. What I&#039;m thinking about doing is making the account, talking to the ONE guy in my area who is on there, making the $150-200 and having it sent directly to my SR wallet. Which is the other concern too, I know no one is keen doing that. Some people do, some people have several wallets they wash their coins through. But for the sake of eliminating hassles and making more potential problems I thought getting them sent directly to my SR wallet would be quicker and more effective. Is that even an option in the first place or do I need another wallet as a requirement? I figured I&#039;d do it for the first time. Like say I do the transaction on Monday I can go and check SR immediately and see it&#039;s there and if everything goes through then I&#039;ll add some more layers of security because this might be my one and only purchase for a while.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also some of you said you met the localbitcoin dealer personally? Is that normal or something you can request? I don&#039;t have a laptop. So I couldn&#039;t check immediately but I feel like meeting someone in person might increase my chances of not being completely scammed. I hardly trust anyone in this city in the first place. Like I said there is only one person on my localbitcoin in my area. Is that a redflag? Can I make an account tonight or tomorrow and set it up to do the deal next week or the week after that? Ideally I&#039;d do it this coming week. <br /><br />Sorry for being a noob, this is my first time and I want to be as informed as possible about it before I do it. Once I can get the bitcoin and funding situation resolved than I&#039;ll move on to my due diligence for vendors.

				Okay, calm down. My advice is to not meet in person and deal with somebody who has 30+ transactions and 100% feedback. With an LBTC account, you&#039;re given a wallet. Send the money from there to SR, not directly to SR. It may be a little intimidating at first but this shit is simple...well, my cash deposits are at least.

				My first localbitcoin transaction was $700. I only had 1 guy close that could meet but he would only do $100. So I found a guy out of state with 100+ transactions and did a bank deposit. Super easy. His coins are in escrow so I dont see how they could scam you.

				first of all Bitcoins are used for other legal purchases not just SR. I prefer to deal with someone who accept cash deposit at one of the major banks. Make sure to check the stats of the vendor first and most important how fast he releases the coins. Good luck.

				I have used Local Bitcoins three times.&nbsp; The amounts ranged from $75-$300.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done cash deposits at my local bank and an online transfer.&nbsp; It is quick and easy.&nbsp; Same rules apply there as here.&nbsp; Find a seller with a good rep, don&#039;t spend more than you can afford to lose, and stay in escrow!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Do not mention Silk Road when you&#039;re dealing with a seller on LBC. A lot of them (myself included) will not deal with you if you mention it. If you keep your mouth closed about SR then no one cares what you&#039;re doing with the coin. Therefore, do not ask a seller to send coins to your SR wallet because you&#039;ll have one on LBC but it won&#039;t have any coins in it if you mention SR.

				LocalBitcoins is great!<br /><br />1) Find a seller who will accept a cash deposit at a bank in your area. It doesn&#039;t matter where the seller is located.<br />2) Go into the bank&#039;s lobby and grab a handfull of deposit slips from the kiosk, maybe 10 or 12 of &#039;em.<br />3) Fill out the deposit slip and use the drive-thru for all of your cash deposits. Simple.<br /><br />The only thing more anonymous would be cash-by-mail... a risk I personally am not willing to take.<br />Use LBC. They directly empower buyers and sellers of BitCoin while keeping your money safe.<br />The seller must place BTC in escrow to make the sell. If they refuse to release your Coin after you make payment, you can send the deposit info to LocalBitcoins and they&#039;ll release your BTC after confirming it with the bank. Nice and safe. DO IT!

				Okay I just made contact with the one localbitcoin guy tonight. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213288.msg1550381#msg1550381">Quote from: livestr0ng on September 20, 2013, 06:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay, calm down.

Know I&#039;m confused about what to do. If I do that -- and that&#039;s sending red flags up for me -- can I give him my SR wallet or should I use a different one? <br /><br />Dammit... why can&#039;t this dude just use localbitcoins. This is what I meant about people in my area being shady all the time.&nbsp;

If so, you&#039;ll be able to verify the coins have been received via blockchain.info&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />People on these forums have been posting numerous complaints about blockchain.info so I don&#039;t know if I trust it at all. Dammit... Why can&#039;t things just go smooth for me of once? I&#039;m doing this because I don&#039;t trust people to buy stuff in real life and this shit right here is why. You signed up for localbitcoins, why can&#039;t you just use it? Who cares if they charge you a 1% it&#039;s to make sure you don&#039;t screw people over. <br />

				Good news everyone! <br /><br />They localbitcoin guy turned out to be reliable and I got my coins send to blockchain. I just sent them here but they aren&#039;t there yet. However I know this can take some time so I&#039;m just being patient and waiting a couple hours. The guy I bought from was an odd character but checked out well enough. So far so good, just waiting for the coins to hit my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all the help and advice everyone!

				How do you know if the LBTC seller accepts bank deposits? Do you have to be messaging with him to figure that out, or does it actually say that under their names because from what I can see they&#039;re all different sites that just have separate ways of dealing with money.
