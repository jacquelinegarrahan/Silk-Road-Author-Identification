				This decoy idea could really go places.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could see it working for domestic weed. Each time someone makes a domestic weed order, all they need to do is send out a package&nbsp; full of newspaper or something, and rub a bud all over outside. If everyone did this there would be an equal number of decoys floating around the system at anyone time!<br />This would work, but I don&#039;t think domestic interception is that big a problem. What is really needed is some system of ensuring that equal number of decoys comes through customs. Simply sending out a decoy each time you order international wont really help as outgoing mail is separate from incoming.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One idea is a buddy system. Say you are in US and like to order from Europe. You buddy up with a European who likes to order from US. Each time you want an order you PM your buddy and get him to send a decoy at the same time. If everyone did this then half the stuff coming through customs would be decoy and this has to reduce interception.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You could send your buddy enough btc to cover the postage.<br />The only risk is if you accidentally buddy up with LE; but even then, all they know is a package is headed for customs in a particular week. No real help to them.

I&#039;ve mailed thousands of legit packages/parcels I&#039;ve touched,&nbsp; 90% of the time it was while smoking a joint or&nbsp; after just grinding up some weed.&nbsp; We used the same bins to roll joints on as were used to hold post.<br /><br />excellent idea, Some bottle of&nbsp; a scent of a certain drug, similar to animal horrmones. Make all normal packages out to be class A or whatever, The manpower required to open all these ould cause a huge backlog etc and after a few days not only would the sorters be missing more legit packages because they have so many packages they have &quot;caught&quot; because of the smell that it leaves much more time for your package to get through safely But the real packages would be sailing through . <br /><br />im all for it. Set up a network,&nbsp; 5 people per continent whose role or duty it is to send these fake packages out all the time smelling of drugs, to different locations especially ones with larger sorting offices. Postal services details could be posted by employees in a special topic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What we need is a few postal employees to rub bud on thousands of packages daily.<br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know a guy who knows a guy who is a UPS driver.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see what I can do, locally.&nbsp; We should have people doing this all over the world.&nbsp; Any ideas on how we could orchestrate this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I love this &quot;decoy&quot; Idea.. but Id say dont do it on a huge scale until were ready to boycott or strike back, maybe Ausies might wanna start doing this though.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder if so many &quot;scented&quot; decoys were sent out that the smell would stick to everything and contaminate the whole system eventually, forcing them to upgrade their equipment..&nbsp; if you sprayed it with a nice sticky cannabis oil the smell would stick to EVERYTHING, including other packages,&nbsp; the postmans hands, the customs hands.&nbsp; eventually it would contaminate the entire system.&nbsp; but at this point its so easy to get shit through the USA&nbsp; so why even fuck with it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m going to repeat myself...&nbsp; THE STINKY WEED WATER LEFT OVER FROM MAKING BUBBLEHASH WITH BUBBLE BAGS!<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133659.msg979743;topicseen#msg979743

				Quote From original post link.......Hey didn&#039;t this dude get busted over a year ago?&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s inly just got to court... :-\<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At the time of Howard&#039;s arrest, the Australian Federal Police and the Customs and Border Protection Service issued a warning to any would-be drug traders using supposedly anonymous marketplaces such as the Silk Road saying they could be identified by police techniques.<br /><br />AFP manager of crime operations Peter Sykora said in a statement: &quot;Criminals are attempting to exploit the international mail system through online networks, but the recent arrest demonstrates that we are one step ahead of them. The AFP will continue to identify, investigate and prosecute individuals or groups importing narcotics into Australia, including via illicit ecommerce platforms such as Silk Road.&quot;<br /><br />Australian police aren&#039;t the only ones to crack down on the Silk Road. The DEA in the United States is also on the warpath, targeting similar sites such as the Farmer&#039;s Market. In July 2012 the organisation told a US news station KXAN that it was investigating the Silk Road and in November 2012, DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne told The Verge when quizzed on the Silk Road: &quot;Typically we&#039;re not really giving out investigative updates about what we&#039;re doing, but it&#039;s safe to say we are heavily involved in looking into that.&quot; In the UK, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police E-Crime unit have also been digging into the marketplace.<br /><br />However, despite all of these investigations, the conviction rate isn&#039;t looking all that promising for law enforcement.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yeah but the aussies need OTHER countries to send bogus scented mail to us!<br /><br />The hash water idea has merit but just putting a gram of pot (or any drug really mdma etc) in 100mls of metho/alcohol and splashing that in the box will do the least harm, AND evaporate while still leaving the scent....<br /><br />Bee careful all...stay safe&nbsp; :)
