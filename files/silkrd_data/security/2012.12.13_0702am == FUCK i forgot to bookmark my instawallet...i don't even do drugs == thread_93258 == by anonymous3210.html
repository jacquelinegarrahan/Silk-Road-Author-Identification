				I don&#039;t think so no. The tor browser keeps no history , once you close a page its gone , even if you have not closed the browser.

				man just type in the address to go the sight and see if it will give you the last one it went to, sometimes it will. i got lucky once and when i just punched in the url it went to the last purse i had for bitcoin but it probably wont work. sorry man that really sucks. its worth giving the URL a name you can remember to avoid it.

Just go to the proxy settings and check the box. You&#039;ll know it&#039;s connecting through Tor because it will only connect to the network if Tor is running.<br /><br />I would download the blockchain over clearnet, which can take a few days (but it&#039;s worth it!), turn on the proxy, close the program, find and delete wallet.dat (which shouldn&#039;t have any bitcoins in it yet), run the program again (which will randomly generate a new wallet.dat file and thus new addresses) and bam, you have a bitcoin wallet that has no association with your real IP address. Not only that, but every Bitcoin-related site in the world could disappear overnight and you would retain your wallet for when the coast is clear (assuming the bitcoin network itself stays intact.)<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Here&#039;s a nice step-by-step guide to the wallet.dat stuff. It&#039;s really not that bad:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet#Making_a_new_wallet
