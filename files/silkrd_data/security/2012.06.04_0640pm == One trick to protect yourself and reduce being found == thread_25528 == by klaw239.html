				Friends when you post on here please do not&nbsp; do so in the norm. I.E leave quotes&nbsp; and tags you use all over the internet on random sites and forums&nbsp; and speak of which sports team you love and hate unless it is falsehoods and that I encourage but never put anything on here or related to SR that is a part of your normal every day life cause internet searches can be done on such things and&nbsp; they can eliminate over time how a person types and if they misspell and not correct or have poor&nbsp; English or whatever language skills and compare what you write&nbsp; and write about here compared to what you may have said else where&nbsp; &nbsp;and trace back your origin. <br /><br />Look at my for example. I seem to have a 6 grade level English set for paragraph structure and other such things but hey I could be doing it on purpose. Who knows right? Keep it always at who knows?????<br /><br />Do NOT be a creature of habit or become one. I do not care if it is just walking to the store or the bus stop take alternate routes&nbsp; at random times if possible and like wise with what you do on here. I.E times you post and&nbsp; the weather out side on any given day or night. Keep all things&nbsp; guarded&nbsp; cause it is in your lack of knowledge to do such things that they take advantage of. That is why the freedom of speech is such a valuable&nbsp; freedom and also why&nbsp; the first causality of any war&nbsp; is the&nbsp; TRUTH as far as what you see and hear.<br /><br />Logic over common sense folks but try and have a little of both&nbsp; but never all of common sense. Common sense dictated 200 yrs ago that man would never fly but here we are today doing what? be smart and think before acting and saying.&nbsp; &nbsp;Especially now cause be certain we are being watched and logged and looked for&nbsp; if not to be used for a tool to make a point and set an example of one of us&nbsp; then to have intell on us and that is their most valuable and powerful weapon. It is up to us&nbsp; and our own lack of action and thought if we load that weapon&nbsp; for them. <br /><br />Take care!

				I very carefully chose a user name of a character in popular youth culture&nbsp; that thousands use. Even the digits 239 are of the norm even connected to this name. I never&nbsp; post same name on other forums. I am a paranoid individual who tries and think of every contingency if I can.

				it is not the leak is self that is important and valuable it is the validity and truth or half truths of that leak that is important. I cover my steps. Best I can anyways. Not to challenge someone to locate me but to just be safe. I have others beside my self to consider and&nbsp; everyone&#039;s safety even strangers is high on my list.<br /><br />While I do not prescribe anyone to worship any certain religion I do think people should practice the ways of a god even if it is not the one you worship. Jesus to me taught people nothing but moral just beliefs. If i believe in him or not I think his teachings and views on how you treat others and to love people&nbsp; is a sound philosophy to practice. I just believe that while you may love your enemy sometimes that enemy must be taken out because his very existence&nbsp; hurts and preys on others&nbsp; . Many confuse caring and compassion for weakness but it is only in times of war and aggression that the tiger shows his claws.&nbsp; He does not kill just to kill unless he is mentally disturbed and or evil. <br /><br />and do not get me wrong not everyone that does wrong is evil. The brain can become sick just like the body can. It is a very very thin line. Same as greatness and insanity is. That is why men of aggression need to be coupled with men of reason and diplomacy. If not it is always a pissing contest of the beast within&nbsp; to conquer and defeat the other through&nbsp; aggression and violent means when another solution could have prevailed if only the mind to do so was present.<br /><br />If a person strives to be anything at all in this world let it be a man of woman of resolve and peaceful intentions/restraint/understanding and sympathy but also not hesitate to flip the switch and destroy that which is in front of him/her without thought or or conscious cause once that flip has been switched it has been switched ONLY after all those other options have been put in place and tested.<br /><br />That is what separates the rouge&nbsp; and violent&nbsp; and dangerous human being from most (not all you find in prison for&nbsp; violent crimes) they lack the ability to think and process information in the correct way under different circumstances. <br /><br />I wish no harm to anyone and I would only hurt or imprison another&nbsp; if they were a person who prayed on and hurt the innocent for they are the true criminals not only against land and state but of god.

				I agree Trr. ..........Social occasions of diplomacy have only warfare concealed . But it is a last measure for most if the goal is not to attain peace with and through Diplomacy then the motivation is laws elsewhere.<br /><br />As far as what you were taught. True to teach a person being trained for a certain task especially one of&nbsp; default human error such as kindness and emotion then it is important to train a individual but it is also to make certain that person/persons knows when to turn that side of him or her self off and when to turn it on. Other wise he or she is a walking zombie programed to do as told and no longer a living breathing human being.<br /><br />I often wonder if such men and women ever lean back and think &quot;when was the last time I actually loved someone or trusted someone or cared enough for someone to lend a helping hand?&quot;<br /><br />In the field put training and weapons to good use. The most powerful weapon is the mind that is why it is trained first as the body will follow. Just be sure to keep part of your brain to come back from a stage of ..hell I do not know but it is not a place I would want to stay in.<br /><br />

				Did you all become paranoid after too much drug using?<br />Never ever will anyone (LE) search little buyers to arrest them.<br />It&#039;s more likely that vendors are observed, but then where&#039;s the evidence? Just because of the same forum name or anything like that? I&#039;m not dumb or fully unparanoid and aware of the risks, but you are very anxious.

				they will arrest you in a new york minute if you got information related o a person that usually reminds silent but if you ha that you would not be trusted&nbsp; selling on the streets.Dog&nbsp; soldiers are usually cannon fodder&nbsp; and expendable to those in high places . Stupid enough to do as told without thinking before acting yet street smart enough to handle the work assigned . As I have said before&nbsp; convince the little man he is serving some grand cause and he will murder and kill witches for you and he will do it with a smile&nbsp; because he thinks its right.<br /><br />As far as saying&nbsp; NEVER never and impossible is a word used only in the dictionary of fools.&nbsp; I promise you if you are here you might&nbsp; not be a target but rest assured your card is in the desk to be used if their is any advantage to it.<br /><br />our Gov morality is such&nbsp; they let a convicted murderer of over 100 violent murderers walk our streets among our children&nbsp; so they could put John Gotti away a man with hardly no convictions. Be certain&nbsp; the Gov always does what is it&#039;s best interest. Examine the steps and dominions that would fall should some laws such a prohibition&nbsp; were repealed. Pain medication would take&nbsp; how many business out and how much Dr&#039;s and insurance companies would lose if you were in pain and could just got to a liqueur and buy a roxi or some heroin?<br /><br />Why do you think MDMA was outlawed. No Gov offical said anything till it got to massive numbers and it was not the masssive numbers that directed them to ban the substance it was where the massive numbers where at. CLUBS and BARS&nbsp; . So if you can buy a safe drug&nbsp; for 6 or 10 bucks and take it and enjoy a high alll night on that&nbsp; who is going to sip on and order beer and liqueur all night?<br /><br />The alcohol&nbsp; industry would barley survive if not lose 50% of it&#039;s profits. The call was made&nbsp; mr.ghost&nbsp; paid the payment and there it goes. So much for free trade and enterprise&nbsp; right?<br /><br />I dislike weed but it to never has killed anyone&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes drunk drivers kill everyday. It is a story on the 6 oclock news and then the poor child in the ground is forgotten bought cause they make a point not to discuss that&nbsp; but always discuss what&nbsp; scheduled items will do.<br /><br />How can anyone serve a&nbsp; like a country that lies and murders and places it&#039;s own people in&nbsp; bondage.? I so struggle to understand.

There are a few reasons why LE might decide to shake down a regular small-time buyer.&nbsp; For one thing, there&#039;s a non-trivial chance that one or more sellers have compromised their anonymity in dealing with said buyer.&nbsp; (&quot;Sure, I know joebuyer: I&#039;ve sold to him a dozen times. What&#039;s the harm in letting him buy an order off SR with Western Union, Paypal, etc.? It will save me the commission and give me access to funds that are more convenient than Bitcoins.&quot;)&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s also the publicity value of such a bust, especially if you are dealing with relatively small-time law enforcement.&nbsp; (&quot;The Bumfucknowhere Police Department SAVES THE CHILDREN by arresting someone who bought several GRAMS of the dangerous chemical Ecstasy, obviously with the intent to sell... sure, he bought it over the course of a year, but that was just part of his cover....&quot;).&nbsp; And while we&#039;re on the subject of busts, what about the scenario where a vendor gets busted and has some easily available information on the computer? That could easily become a &quot;CYBER METH RING BUSTED!!!&quot; etc. headline. <br /><br />Basically, if you are smart and careful and your vendors are smart and careful you&#039;re probably covered.&nbsp; But you are trusting that your vendors ARE taking appropriate precautions, and could be in for a nasty surprise if they&#039;re not.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an enormous chance of this happening, but it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry.&nbsp; Assuming there&#039;s zero risk might lead to a nasty surprise down the (silk) road.
