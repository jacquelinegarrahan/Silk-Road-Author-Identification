				What could bitinstant be giving to LE?&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing illegal about what bitinstant does so as long as you anonymize your coins after you transfer them through bitinstant (which you should be doing anyway) you should be fine.

				get-bitcoin.com is still pretty anonymous, at least for smallish amounts. Unless you&#039;re allergic to cctv cameras in banks. No need to provide any ID.<br /><br />goblin

				i would recommend getting a new SR address every time you are depositing or withdrawing, if you are concerned about security.... that way there is no pattern of transfers in and out.<br /><br />campbx is a newer trading site, it has worked well for me so far.

				I thought the same thing about bitinstant... My identity is no ones business, so I used a fake name. CVS tried to ID me, so I told them I would take my business elsewhere. After searching I found a place in my area that doesn&#039;t require ID. <br /><br />While it can still be done anonymously to date, I worry that won&#039;t last much longer. Requiring ID is really the only move LE has. The irony is that won&#039;t shut down the road, only increase the fees average Joe PotSmoker pays trying to cover his tracks. Kind of like how the war on drugs is only successful in making drugs more expensive, not making them harder to find. Fuck the US government.

				it takes me about 5 days from cash to coins with my online process using campbx. <br /><br />unlike other sites i&#039;ve used; intersango mtgox etc etc where you need to get verified and wait 30 days you can start swingin as soon as you step up to the plate at campbx. also allows you to do &quot;dark pool&quot; orders, where your bid/ask prices aren&#039;t telegraphed to the entire nation<br /><br />pretty solid site if you&#039;ve got a way to get your dollas in that bitch, there&#039;s a couple different ways<br /><br />i&#039;ve also seen a video interview of the dude who is the CFO of campbx talking about deep web and silk road and what have you.... seems to me that he&#039;s on our side. probably smokes his dope right up <br /><br />-and sausage links.

				I still use bitinstant. I will do a CVS order to a FAKE mt.gox account, using the CVS feature will still end up being a moneygram order in the end(I receive money not coins! (please make an unverified account, of course...)). I ALWAYS use a fake name/address/ect, so if for some reason they busted/harassed zip-zap/bitinstant none of the information LE would get would be connected to me/you. Then I go and buy coins on the Mt.Gox account with the money that was just deposited into it (by the time i get back from the moneygram order the cash is in the account, yes 10 minutes is the longest I have&nbsp; waited the 20x&#039;s i have done this).<br />*NOTE*&nbsp; &nbsp; You cannot use a mt.gox account on a computer that uses tor, so go down to a local computer facility(church, library, ANYWHERE PUBLIC) and do your business there!(key step guys, don&#039;t use your home computer!)&nbsp; &nbsp;*NOTE*<br />&nbsp;After purchasing my NEW bitcoins(bought on the market by ME,so not traced to anyone(If you listened)) I will then send them to the wallet of my choosing, I really don&#039;t find tumbling to be necessary as my name is not connected to the coins in the first place. The whole trick relies on buying cash(sent to a FAKE mt.gox account) with the moneygram order and then turning that cash into coins, see, you never bought bitcoins! You buy cash and then turn them into bitcoins and then you tumbled them or whatever the hell your paranoid mind thinks you should do.&nbsp; :P<br />That&#039;s what I do, don&#039;t know why anyone else doesn&#039;t, shit, hope my method doesn&#039;t get shutdown after telling everyone how to do it,lol,jkjk.

				Just did a bitinstant order via Moneygram at a generic drug store. Coins arrived at the exchange in less than an hour, then another hour or so to SR from there. Placed a bunch of orders just now and everything proceeded as usual. I&#039;ll try to update when they ship.
