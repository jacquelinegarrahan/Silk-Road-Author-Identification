				Title: <strong>Using fake information</strong><br />

				Warning this is a bit long...<br /><br />I see a lot from sellers on this topic and I just want to say&nbsp; that I think instead of condemning the acts, that you learn to try and work with buyers wanting this option. As a seller, you go to great lengths to protect yourself, as you should. Being the buyer is no different. If you are doing what you should be doing properly, the only real risk is to the buyer. So you got down the ways to go about your business properly, fake information is one of those things that is a buyer does properly, has no risk associated with him/her.<br /><br />First of all I am not too &#039;scared&#039; to put my name on a package.&nbsp; The problem here is that as a buyer, we have no idea who is receiving this information and what they are doing with it. This has NOTHING to do with worrying about the contents of the package or giving ourselves some false sense of security. This has everything to do with protecting your own security. As a buyer we have no CLUE want kind of person is taking our &#039;real information&#039;. For all we know it could be laying around somewhere or even worse googled. <br /><br />Now let me just say I got to great lengths to make sure my fake information will not decline a packaged and the seller must trust some buyers goes to these lengths just as the buyers must trust the seller to go to the lengths of not leaving addresses around or god forbid googling the information. You really want someone googling your real address/name/information? As buyers, this terrifies us and sellers need to be more sensitive to the fact it is not about having your real name on a package it&#039;s about going the lengths to not give your real information to 10+ different sellers who probably aren&#039;t all doing things as they should.<br /><br />I think buyers should tell the sellers they are using fake information out of respect. The key to both our safety is communication and cooperation. I don&#039;t tell sellers because I have received mail with this fake information for years and have never had an issue. So if I have gone to these lengths to ensure I a going to receive my mail, should a seller really demand I stop doing what I have done for years, that has always worked for me? <br /><br />I have only had a few orders from silk road (all received fine under fake information, I&#039;m 25/25) but I read a seller&#039;s profile and it prompted me tow write this. Sellers need to realize there is more to using fake information than just a package being sent to us. It&#039;s about the information being out there. <br /><br />Do not assume because you do things proper and are ridding yourself of the information that the buyer knows this or/and other sellers give us (buyers) the same respect and destroy the information like you. I realize there are some buyers who are very disrespectful and will do stupid things like use obviously fake information to a PO box, but there are also smart buyers out there who can use fake information because that information has been established through hard work.<br /><br />So work with your buyers, let them know their information will be destroyed ASAP on your page, or through a message. And then ACTUALLY DO IT (and do not google the info) I guarantee buyers will be more apt to give you real information. I think buyers should have some say in this too and I don&#039;t think sellers need to &#039;take back&#039; the silk road, there is no safety in that, only in both parties working together. <br /><br />If you do not want to work with buyers that is your right. If you are going to be requesting real names you need to be more sensitive to getting the point across to your buyers that their information will be disposed of properly. If you are too LAZY to at least put this on your page or notify buyers via message, or too LAZY to have a system in place to dispose of information properly, or too dumb to go and google our information, please do not demand real information from the buyers.

Why?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well there are some good reasons not to. Some people really are the dumb and but names like &quot;Smokey Pete&quot; for their pound of bud order. There are also dumb people who don&#039;t know how to test their mailbox properly or won&#039;t put a fake name on a piece of paper.<br /><br />If the sellers is doing things properly, fake information shouldn&#039;t matter and if the buyer is doing things properly they are not giving out their real information and are still receiving packages. This is the ultimate scenario for BOTH parties, not just the seller.<br /><br />Fake information doesn&#039;t not necessarily mean unfamiliar information to the post office, I think sellers sometimes confuse the meanings.

				Whilst we&#039;re on the topic, what should we do other than give a fake name to our address to ensure everything goes smoothly? What if you have to pick it up from the PO box? That means getting a fake ID.

Vendors simply want to reduce the chances of customs nabbing a package and having to reship/refund.
