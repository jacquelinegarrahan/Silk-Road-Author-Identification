				I am going to order Uglysufer&#039;s Darknet Bootable USB - but I would love to have a consensus or at least some proponents of Uglysurfers work- so as to confirm that his USBs are not implanted with any sinister components or government sponsored spying shit. <br /><br />But seriously can any longstanding member vouch for its safety?

				Good to see you are using your brain and not jumping in without testing the water first.<br />But why pay for something when you can get it for free?&nbsp; Check out the Liberte Linux USB, it has everything you need to surf the darknet anonymously, including an encrypted volume. The clearnet link is:<br />www.dee.su/liberte <br />and there is a YouTube video (I have not looked at this by the way):<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1K6p7qWlTM <br />You can google or startpage Liberte Linux for more info.

				Build your own usb live system. Do not let someone else handle your security for you, take it into your own hands.

				It is not recommended to buy a bootable USB drive. You don&#039;t know how or by who it was created. It&#039;s possible it comes straight from the police. Or maybe it gets intercepted by a third party who adds spyware to it.<br /><br />The seller is probably a stand-up guy, but this is just not the proper way to do it. You can easily create a Libert√© or Tails bootable USB drive yourself. It&#039;s cheaper and offers better security.

				Im glad to be in the company of other natural skeptics. Good advice all- thank you. Now the thing is after seeing what is being offered with Linux, i2p, truecrypt within truecrypt containers, I cant go back to Tails. And as hard as trying to figure out tails was im sure it will be 10 times harder with all this new stuff I want. So I guess I will open a new thread asking for instruction as to how to make a Liberte-like package as I am not knowledgeable enough at this point to do it properly as I would be too concerned I missed something and I will be exposed. Besides I would happily pay 10 times the cost of one to learn how to do it myself, with an expert mentor. If any of you guys are interested before I open a new topic please do let me know. And thanks again for the suggestions.

				Linux, i2p, truecrypt within truecrypt containers... TAILS does all of this.

				Ah ha well thats good to know. But is one configuration more secure than the other?

				There is more to one&#039;s choice of implementation or &quot;platform &quot; than just security.&nbsp; For example, some people value plausible deny-ability, and if using TrueCrypt, they set up two containers, one of which has their SR stuff and another that has something like banking documents and other private papers. Then if they are forced to reveal the TrueCrypt password (which they can be in some countries by LE etc)&nbsp; they can offer up the password of the latter and&nbsp; so keep the SR container hidden. Other people like the Liberte Linux route, which has an encrypted container already set up. I don&#039;t know about TAILS, other than many people swear by it (bloody TAILS!)<br />As far as I know neither are hard to setup, you can find all the information on the clearnet using Google (or whatever search engine you prefer).
