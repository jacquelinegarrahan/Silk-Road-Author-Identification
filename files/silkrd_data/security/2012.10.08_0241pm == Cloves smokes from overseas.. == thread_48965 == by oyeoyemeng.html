I doubt most LEO even know Obama made them illegal.

				Does tobacco sell pretty well here? I&#039;ve been thinking about growing some Virgina. I also wonder if the dogs are going to start alerting to it, Figure its been two years since Obama signed that law, so LEO and Post Office inspectors should be up to speed by now.
