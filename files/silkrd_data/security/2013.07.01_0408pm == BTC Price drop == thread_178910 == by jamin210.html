				Sheesh!!! $92.20 USD per BTC right now. i wonder if/when the value will go back up. I&#039;m assuming buying right now could be a great investment or a horrible loss.. as it always is. But more now than last week<br /><br />Input anyone?

				Happens at the end of the month just about every month. Prices dive way down around the 30th-1st then slowly trend back up. 2 weeks from now I imagine they will be over 110 or 115. I normally buy when it hits the 80&#039;s on BTC-e which it has. They are 85 each on there right now.

				Yeah, I&#039;m recently disappointed. If you look at various indicators of interest in bitcoin, they are all way down compared to a few months ago.<br /><br />Number of transactions excluding popular addresses (ie, Satoshi Dice): https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popular<br /><br />Number of transactions per block: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-block<br /><br />Number of unique addresses used: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses<br /><br />Most importantly, USD exchange trade volume: https://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume<br /><br />We lost a lot of momentum with that crash, and it seems like every once in a while someone holding a lot of BTC decides to cash out.<br />

				The US is only one market where Bitcoin use has declined....I think within the next 6 months the price will increase substantially, factoring in the increased development of the currency. The US gov (FinCEN) has accepted the validity of the currency...see their recent press release. One concern is the bank lobby, which makes a fortune ripping off small businesses and consumers with superfluous charges. Many start up companies will come online in near the future, then we should have a better idea of Bitcoin trajectory. The benefit in Bitcoin is mostly it&#039;s practicality/psuedo-anonomity, I do not think SN intended the currency to be completely an investment but an easily&nbsp; exchanged decentralized currency, which can store value. The prime number sequences become more of a challenge to compute as the numbers grow; comparable to mining gold. If only someone could solve the Riemann hypothesis....

				The important thing to remember is that the drugs cost the same whether a bitcoin is worth a dollar or 100 dollars!<br /><br />I agree it is a gamble using btc and I guess buying some drugs now will be best left will next week or the week after when the btc is worth 100 dollars again!<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to wait as I buy maybe once a month or so just one certain drug. The rest are readily avaliable in the real world!

The trading volume on the various exchanges is so low that, as mentioned earlier, a single person cashing out from Bitcoin to fiat is enough to make noticeable movements in the Bitcoin price. If you buy Bitcoins, your country&#039;s dollar/currency does not see a significant hit. In selling Bitcoin, it&#039;s a whole other story.<br /><br />But like I said, it&#039;s with widespread acceptance as a form of payment will a stable price come. Until then, it&#039;ll go up and down all over the place until it either becomes worth nothing, or becomes worth a lot for a single BTC.

				Heard somewhere that there is also &quot;smallcoin&quot; now. Don&#039;t know anything about it. But if that is a new currency then that might work against the value of btc?<br /><br />I also remember the time where 1btc was $10/less. On SR that did not really matter. Had I kept them then I would be kind of rich now.<br /><br />Investing always costs and gains you money. But you&#039;d have to be good at it just with every other thing you can invest in, in order to predict it&#039;s future. And even then you can be teriibly wrong.

Right as it started, I saw a trade for 315 BTC at $239. Whoever sold was a genius in retrospect. Whoever bought that BTC, if it was one person, has lost $50,000 of $75,000. So if anyone reading this is depressed about losing 10% in the last week, think of that guy. <br /><br />My motto: shit could be worse.

				i don&#039;t like any of my current options to get bitcoins. i was going to make a purchase of some coins, but it might be better to just hold onto my cash. it looks like, to me, it&#039;s harder to get ahold of some bitcoins (anonymously) due changing government regulations. oh well though, i spent about $550 for 30 coins, so i&#039;m still up overall.<br /><br />it&#039;s confounding to me that some people were speculating &quot;bitcoins will hit 10,000 easily&quot; thinking that government could no way affect its growth. sure, as of now government has no way of completely stopping bitcoins, but they can very easily put a big hurdle on bitcoin&#039;s development. i sure wish it would reach sugh heights, but to me, it&#039;s a longshot and if it does occur.. it won&#039;t be any time within the next few years.

				Quick buy drugs while you BTC is still valuable!<br /><br />Personally I think its just another crash fueled by emotion , recently there have been many bitcoin amateurs coming into the market these are the kind of people who would easily get scared and call &#039;bubble&#039; , IF it goes down to 30-40 I won&#039;t be too worried since I&#039;m in it for the long haul&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />The more the price drops while I&#039;m selling and the longer is stays low while I&#039;m selling the better off IL be in 2-3 years time if the price gets back about 100usd.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, I have to add my 2c, as I am a believer in bitcoin.&nbsp; Yes, I agree that the price is arbitrary, and that it&#039;s primary use is a store of value.&nbsp; But here&#039;s the thing= I&#039;ll still be buying my alternative-medicines with it, and I expect that more people will use it in a closed-circuit type of way, where vendors(anonymously) sell coin to buyers.&nbsp; Even if we have to do it at a buck a coin, or use some extremely technical BTC-by-IRC type of deal, nothing will stop this.&nbsp; I am prepared to lose however much I am holding- but I blame the downfall of BTC on the fact that the miner&#039;s have been hording since the beginning.&nbsp; Now, we have this huge mining investment, and all of those horders, &#039;true believers&#039; who mined back in &#039;09, are cashing out to mine Terracoin or whatever, great.&nbsp; If they had been going out and finding ways to sell bitcoin anonymously, instead of through exchanges this whole time, their product would be worth vastly more, but they didn&#039;t do that, they left it to foreign and domestic corporations who didn&#039;t have the infrastructure to handle it.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will weather this storm, I&#039;ve always said this, but if Bitcoin fails, another coin will take its place, and it will be just as good, if not better.&nbsp; There were unforseen problems with the original code, and the bitcoin foundation hasn&#039;t really done much to win over the politicos out there, but we will find sanctuary, somewhere, and if you believe in digital, decentralized, coin tech, than we can all agree that it will exist, I don&#039;t care if I have to sell it in back alleys or parking lots, it will be done.&nbsp; Virtual Currency is the future, the sooner the governments of the world realize that, the better off we will all be.&nbsp; Every new technology takes at least 5 years to become mainstream, we are 3 years in, with an entirely new product.&nbsp; &nbsp;For the first 150 years of the US, &#039;script&#039; or &#039;store money&#039; was accepted as trade and could be redeemed at stores, in many places without banks, people almost never saw dollar bills, and would keep small gold coins for savings.&nbsp; There is no difference with BTC, it is script, which our founding fathers in the US were very, very, familiar with.&nbsp; This is why people don&#039;t find huge caches of old paper money very often, it is a relatively new invention, and degrades easily.&nbsp; Viva La Bitcoin Revolucion! <br />

				i remember telling myself that once bitcion hit the mainstream, there would be increased government regulation which would lead to a bearish sell-off effect.. i wasn&#039;t very interested with BTC&#039;s since march though, and didn&#039;t cash out.<br /><br />really, i don&#039;t see how people could claim that bitcoins would $10,000/per.. that would require ubitious use, and acceptance from world governments. people also mainly use bitcoins for SR related purchases and other illegal activities - everyone else is just a speculator.<br /><br />i&#039;m not current with all the new developments of the bitcoin industry, but imo there should be better services for gambling, since bitcoin does fill the void for this need... especially if a site charges only, say, 2% vs. 5% that bookies take home.

They are even initiating litigation against the bitcoin foundation itself for fucks sake. This may not go anywhere but the mere fact that a super liberal enclave like CA would even attempt this is a bad omen.<br /><br />They are attacking bitcoin merchants like bitspend.net which was just shut down under bullshit money transmitter laws. The new FinCEN regulations put in place this March make a clear statement that while bitcoin can&#039;t be stopped, we sure can make it hard to convert into dollars.<br /><br />The EU and Australia are also gearing up for a long hard battle to delegitimize bitcoin and stop all bitcoin to currency conversions.<br /><br />Mt Gox, Dwolla, BitInstant, you name it, if it&#039;s in the bitcoin business it&#039;s now under fire from all angles. Couple this with a decreased interest by the public and it&#039;s no wonder it&#039;s falling so precipitously.<br /><br />Don&#039;t just read these &quot;it&#039;s okay, it will bounce back and be $1000 in no time&quot; rally monkey posts. Just earlier this year it was $15, and it could just as easily get back there before it ever sees $100 again.<br /><br />I no longer view bitcoin as an alternative investment like gold, but as a transaction mechanism only that needs to be treated like hot potato the second it hits my vendor account. God damn shame too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I enjoyed reading that.&nbsp; +1.&nbsp; Oh wait, I can&#039;t.&nbsp; It&#039;s the thought though, right?

				BTC = interesting.<br />Back in the days mining was worth it. Then it became kind of worthless unless you stole energy from somebody else, since the mining barely covered the power consumption.<br /><br />Did they decrease the amount of btc&#039;s per day for mining lately, or did that remain the same and it&#039;s worth doing it again now?<br /><br />Funny how at first I wasted my time by buying for about $5 and selling at $10 in small amounts. If only I knew they would be worth $180 at some point for a very short time...<br /><br />I heard there are more and more alternative sorts of coins coming up lately? Smallcoins, Terracoins? Why for gods sake? BTC&#039;s were going to be a big problem for banks and if you were rich with BTC&#039;s then you&#039;d be rich, instead of having to pay more taxes and spend a lot of your time keeping track of investments...<br /><br />I agree with the above statement that it does not matter what liberals or others think. It&#039;s the people who must not lose faith in BTC&#039;s. And correct me if I&#039;m wrong but aren&#039;t a lot of people already purchasing BTC&#039;s not through banks but by moneypacks and things like that?<br /><br />This must be/have been a terrible time for vendors I can imagine. First you have $10.000 and then half of it or less. <br /><br />Keep on posting&nbsp; 8)

				So for months I spectated as this whole bitcoin phenomenon took off. For months I&#039;ve gathered funds, read and researched trying to learn about bitcoins and I&#039;ve watched their value steadily increase and then decrease etc. After watching them sink for a while I finally decided to take the plunge and establish a bitcoin wallet and SR account, waiting to get the balls up to actually order something. Within a day, BAM, fucking 8 dollar increase in value and thus cost.<br /><br />Fifififiggurs<br />
