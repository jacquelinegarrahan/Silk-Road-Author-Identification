				Just found this place today...they claim that the deposit into MtGox is within a couple hrs, and you can drop the cash deposit off at a local bank anonymously

				Yes. <br /><br />When you go onto Bit Instant and create the deposit &quot;slip&quot; which really just gives you the information it will also give you a participating bank that you need to make the deposit at.&nbsp; Go through the drive through, as for a deposit slip, fill it out and boom. Chase and BOA are the only two banks I believe Bit Instant uses. They charge a handling fee of like 1% or something like that, and the money does indeed show up to Mtgox in a matter of about an hour. I usually use Chase and no questions are asked, partially because most tellers typically don&#039;t give two shits about what you are doing. Use different banks as well, don&#039;t always go to the same one over and over and over. <br /><br />Make sure you read the other thread on here about tumbling the bitcoins and using an instawallet etc. I believe that thread is titled &quot;transferring bc&#039;s to sr&quot; or something of that nature.

				*Do not access mt gox through tor!*<br /><br />bitinstant cash deposits run about 5% fees but you can have btc within an hour or two so it is totally worth it. <br /><br />generally an email is sent with a voucher code to redeem though, so if you just wait for money to show up in mt gox you may get frustrated. check yo email.<br /><br />also, if you bid just a fraction of a cent higher than the lowest ask for coins, the buying btc is instantaneous. if you offer less, you have to wait for someone to accept it.<br /><br />then transfer them to another wallet first, associate with tor, like vibanko or blockexplorer, and then onward to the Road

				I use bitinstant. It&#039;s a lot more anonymous than Dwolla or other services, and much cheaper than BTC Buddy.<br /><br />The fee is like 5% but it&#039;s worth it, plus the coin voucher code for mtgox comes in a few minutes.<br /><br />They give you a code to print out. You don&#039;t actually need the printout - just use the bank account number they give you, and make your deposit slip out to that account. Use a fake name on the deposit slip.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend bitinstant.

				the name of the cash deposit service, trustcash holdings is the name you use on the deposit slip. the other thing you need is the acct number and the exact amount in cash, but trustcash adds on a fee of around a dollar so dont miss that. <br /><br />one time the bank teller asked me for my bank card or id and I just told em it was a commercial account and not mine. all you need is the cash and deposit slip.

				Hey Funk,<br /><br />Just a safe note: regarding instawallet.&nbsp; I would not use the downloadable one cuz if they get corrupted your moneys gone forever.&nbsp; Use the ones that give you a web address.<br /><br />Libby<br />

				Bitinstant now does direct deposit into Mtgox. They no longer used MTgox codes as they did before. I use it when I need to convert usd to btc quick, with 5% fee. Trustcash charges a very nominal fee of like $1.12.

				They been really fast now it goes directly in Mt gox. less than 45 minutes lately. Trust cash is a bill payment site. All I ever say is I&#039;m paying a bill. A lot better/safer than having to deposit into an account called getbitcoins,LLC.
