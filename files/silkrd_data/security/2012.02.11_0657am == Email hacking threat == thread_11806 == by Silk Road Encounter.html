				I open up my email from a recognizable sender.&nbsp; There is a suspicious link.&nbsp; I go back to my inbox.&nbsp; Open another email from the same sender.&nbsp; There is a different, but equally suspicious, link.&nbsp; I got back to my inbox.&nbsp; Another email form the same sender.&nbsp; It has the email address owner&#039;s name, then some broken english about how my account has been hacked.<br /><br />At no point did I click any of the links.&nbsp; I did respond to the email asking &quot;What is this?&quot;<br /><br />Is my email at risk?

				If You open and view e-mail composed in HTML you can load remote image. They can be used for tracing you. Still pretty harmless if you are using Tor.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t open any attachments and click any links.
