				&nbsp;Ok, well, where to start and keep focus?? So many issues arise once you get reading. So..............<br />Do you ask a seller about their shipping methods, or not? I see threads saying YES, find out their methods, so you know what to expect, then I see threads that say NO, don&#039;t ask, you&#039;ll be pegged as a LEO or scammer. <br /><br />Some threads say ALWAYS use your real name and address, so as not to arouse suspicion. Other threads say NEVER use your real nameor address. <br /><br />Then there&#039;s early finalization. Seems some &quot;trusted&quot; sellers have gone rogue scammer when they get a big payday. So, I see threads saying NEVER finalize early,and I see some that say it&#039;s A-OK to finalize early, if it&#039;s a trusted seller. But how can one be trusted from going rogue on yer ass? Even when they are a top 20 seller? <br /><br />Seems these aren&#039;t the only contradictory issues I have come across, but their the two I am asking you to add to the confusion about. Please sound off with your honest opinions. Maybe someone can convince me of what is right.

				My first order just came in today (from Germany to USA). Here&#039;s what I did in respect to your questions:<br /><br />1. I didn&#039;t ask the seller about shipping methods.<br />2. I did use my real name and address.<br />3. I didn&#039;t finalize until I received the package.<br /><br />Everything went smoothly, BUT keep in mind this was for LSD on blotter, which is the absolute most difficult form of drug for the Postal Service to detect.

				I just received my 2nd shipment so I&#039;m new to this too. Just from browsing here it seems that most of the top rated sellers - and it&#039;s probably safest to only use them - explain their shipping methods on their page (click on their name). In terms of using your real name or not, I think - though I may be wrong - that the USPS just looks at the address and not so much at the name. I mailed a test letter to the name I used to make sure it went through and have successfully used that name since. My biggest worry doing that is that it may not get delivered, but if LE were to show up - which is highly unlikely if you use a high rated seller with discreet shipping - you can always deny that it&#039;s mine. But that&#039;s a tough call. Either way has some risks but isn&#039;t his whole enterprise inherently risky anyway?<br /><br />In terms of finalizing early, I think it&#039;s always safest to wait until you receive and if there is a seller that insists you finalize early you take a chance of getting scammed, unless you trust him.

				I&#039;ve read threads where people say use your real name and address, but the buyer&#039;s guide says do not use your real name and use a different address than where the item will be kept.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide.<br /><br />What if I don&#039;t have any friends I would be comfortable sending the package to?<br /><br />Could I use a real address and a name I&#039;ve seen come in the mail before (the previous tenant)?

				As a vendor I appreciate when people use their real names since using a fake name can only cause problems. For instance if a postman who has regularly delivered mail to a house and knows the names of the occupants because they&#039;ve lived there for years suddenly sees a first and last name that doesn&#039;t belong to the house then he&#039;s likely to be suspicious. If you *really* want to you can alter your name slightly and alter a letter in your last name so Jeremy Stewart becomes J. Stewert. <br /><br />To the best of my knowledge nobody has been able to use the legal defense of the wrong name when receiving drugs in the mail. Until someone can produce a citation for a legal case in which the defendent was found not guilty because his name wasn&#039;t on the 10 keys of coke brought to his front step then I&#039;ll keep recommending that buyers use their real name.<br /><br />Using the name of a previous tenant is your best chance for plausible deniability. (Granted I&#039;m not a lawyer but it seems like a pretty legit argument.)

				I always recommend using a real name, or if you are SURE of the previous tenant&#039;s name, you can use that.&nbsp; Or if you have a business you can put you receiving under.&nbsp; &nbsp;Using a fake name just means trouble.&nbsp; It&#039;s a massive numbers game you are playing attempting to get illicits in the mail, and anything that makes your package out of the ordinary increases the odds of interception.&nbsp; This includes your mailman not recognizing the name on the envelope.<br /><br />If you want plausible deniability, keep a magic marker by the door.&nbsp; If you get a package you don&#039;t recognize, put a line through your address and write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the envelope.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mail-order drug cases are very hard to prosecute and usually require either a substantial amount of drugs or a very established pattern to even have a go at it.&nbsp; Nobody can ever prove that you intended to receive those items, unless they can build a history or demonstrate that you purchased it via your web history.<br /><br />99% of interceptions on a personal level are either tossed into the incinerator or kept to build a forensic case on the SENDER, if he&#039;s dumb enough to not be checking for prints and hairs before his package goes on its merry way.&nbsp; The most I have ever heard of anyone receiving for a personal amount, who wasn&#039;t on probation or parole or anything, was just getting a letter from customs saying &quot;hey, this was addressed to you, we took it.&quot; They usually don&#039;t even bother to accuse in the letter, they just recite the statutes that ban whatever illicit it is and ban mailing prohibited substances.<br /><br />I have not heard of many people on here getting into any kind of trouble, and half the ones I have heard of were related to IRL mistakes and had nothing to do with SR in the first place.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty short list, and if you are smart about being a customer you mitigate the odds close to 0.&nbsp; (This includes choosing vendors who have a known reputation for taking their packaging seriously - this is the number one reason why buyers get hassled and stuff gets intercepted:&nbsp; Incompetent packaging.)

				I&#039;ve only made under 10 orders, but from my experience:<br /><br />- I never ask about shipping methods, unless it is a large order, then the most I ask is the size of the package so I know where to have it sent to (I have multiple drops I use).<br /><br />- I never use my real name since I have PO Boxes in multiple cities around me all registered under fake company names (which regularly have junk mail going to them)<br /><br />- I never finalize early the first time dealing with someone, only after a few transactions, and never for large orders. If someone asks/tells you to finalize early, try to find someone else, if you can&#039;t, I don&#039;t know what to say besides to find every review on here that you can about them and read up before you decide to trust them.

				I&#039;m actually less concerned about my postman. I do happen to live in a small town, and as I used to frequently ebay, and still buy somewhat from there (who doesn&#039;t, right?) my postman is used to delivering a lot of packages, even to my nickname/username on ebay. When I sell there, I even use my nickname, so an AKA is not suspicious to them. Any package for my that isn&#039;t a bill is a CD, or a bunch of CD&#039;s. <br />My concern on that is GIVING out my real name to a complete stranger. I read some threads about sellers going rogue, google mapping buyers&#039; adresses, just weird shit like that. As long as the vendor has good skills, I really am only worried about the vendor. <br />I guess I am a bit noid about sending or receiving from overseas. <br /><br />The early finalizing thing is still a 50/50 thing, though. Even reputable vendors require newbs to finalize early. I&#039;m a bit noid about that, too. <br /><br />I really appreciate the opinions, though, and the time taken to give them. Thanks y&#039;all!

				Thanks for that post anarcho 47 i feel better already, I&#039;ve made 7 orders used my real name on all but one and just altered 1 letter on that one. only one order looked a little sketchy, most were good and some were brilliant, also product was what they claimed, at least what I&#039;ve tried anyway. love the idea of using the name of the tenet before me, but what if they put in a name change and get your benzo&#039;s! lucky them i guess
