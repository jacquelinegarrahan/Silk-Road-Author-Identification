				Personally, I use GetBitcoin... You chose a bank branch, it gives you an exact amount to bring with you, you print an invoice (from a different computer than your own if you&#039;d like), take the cash to the branch of your choice with said exact amount and it&#039;s transferred to the wallet of your choosing within a few minutes. I&#039;ve used Dwolla before as well, but it can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days to get to your account.

				I like campbx.com, it&#039;s a reliable site for buying and selling BTC, but you have to add funds for first time buy with DWOLLA. There&#039;s other add funds options, but DWOLLA is the quickest.

				I used get-btc but they changed banks and there is unfortunately not one nearby. I also got tired of them seeming to charge the very highest rate for the entire day for the coins. I started an account with dwolla since they advertised instant everywhere and took the time to verify, but then they BS and instant is not available at this time, and it has been a long time now. I just can not afford to wait days for a transaction that should be instantaneous given the computerized banking methods these days. I would have missed out on the awesome sale, and feel for those who did. <br /><br />I have found the best trade off for me, the most convenient, easiest, and quickest for the most reasonable value has been to use bitinstant.<br /><br />I fund tradehill with cash deposit at bitinstant, which eventually costs about 5% but I have coins even faster than with get-btc in my experience. Get-btc has 24 bank acct deposit too but it costs 8% plus their inflated coin exchange rate so its a rip compared to bitinstant and seems like more of a record with banks.<br /><br />I am grateful I decided to use TH and not Mt gox because without thinking I have signed on while using Tor, before reading Mt gox would have frozen my acct!

With that in mind, you are relying on SR&#039;s tumbler to be fully functional. What if it isn&#039;t? Well then LE contacts mt-gox or whever you buy your bitcoins fromm with the transaction address they could see was received by SR, and get all your info from there.<br /><br />If get the bitcoins anonymously by cash (forexample Moneypak to bitcoins) and then you tumble the money yourself a few times, with a new tor identity every time, you should be good. Just split up the amounts you&#039;re tumbling so it isn&#039;t obvious you are the same person sending to yourself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How would LE get the coins in the first place though? <br /><br />Sorry, slightly confused.

				Could someone provide a few links for some good BTC tumblers? Also, on the MP to BTC, almost double the cost of market value. Too expensive after the MP fees, and the fees of the seller providing the BTC

				I&#039;ve used the following method so far on acquiring BTC. <br /><br />I pay my friend in cash-&gt;He buys the coins for me with a bank wire from Mtgox-&gt;he then sends the coins to a Instawallet I have provided to him on a piece of paper-&gt;I send the coins a few times from a wallet to a few wallets(using TOR all the time)-&gt;and then finally send them all to my SR account and make an order.<br /><br />What our your opinions on the safety of this method?
