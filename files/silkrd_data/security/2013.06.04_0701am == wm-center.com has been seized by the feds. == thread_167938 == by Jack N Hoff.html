				I don&#039;t understand. Why can&#039;t these places just register with the government? And then just be relaxed on the verification requirements that the gov&#039;t requires. I mean, won&#039;t that make it so they at least have some rights before they get shut down. Or make it harder to shut down?

				They can do all of those checks. Just don&#039;t scrutinize the quality of the actual forms of ID. Thus, making their requirements be filled and allowing all of us to all use just scanned documents or forgeries. We can do that now with really nice fake ID&#039;s, but, if they really chilled on the actual authenticity of it then what would they have to worry about. They can say they scrutinized it to the best of their ability.

				Lol, it is okay for you to chalk it up to just that. But, what they are doing right now is a worst method than what I just stated. So, they are not doing their best as it is and still failing.

				To be a bit more constructive, I understand what you mean. Going legit but &quot;allowing&quot; the grey use (through fake documents) but I&#039;m not sure how plausible is that on the long run.<br /><br />You can&#039;t really hint &quot;fakes are good too guys. wink&quot; but you lose clients that want advertised &quot;anon&quot; options that way and control can be a bitch.

				Ya I get what you mean. Anything is better than not trying I think. If all these exchanges get shutdown before anyone thinks of anything better. A lot of us will not be able to make as much money as we once were. Possibly paving the way for our exits off of SR. We do not want that. We hope that someone can devise a system that can at least hold the place until the next placeholder comes along.
