				I was thinking 2 pairs of latex gloves, from the time you print the label to the time you tape it on your package BUT how do you bring it into the post office with gloves on in the middle of summer..<br /><br />Im trying to learn everything before I join the vendors.<br /><br />Any other tips or links would be appreciated.

				Carders buy liquid band-aid stuff and paint their fingertips with it when they go to jackpot ATM machines and cash out PINs.<br />Can also just place two pieces of paper and walk it in. Pick up some free news daily around and carry it like a waiter or something.. countless ways

				Even if you&#039;re using gloves you will still get DNA on the package.<br /><br />If you want to leave no signs you need to store all envelopes in large triple sealed ziplocks, never touch them with your hands at any point. I would buy some second hand clothes (again never touch them) and put them in the ziplock bag with the envelopes. That way some alien DNA should get on them and be confusing if anyone were to try to trace you. When you take them out to put the product in/stick the label on you should use double latex gloves, wear a breathing mask (think Japanese people) and a hairnet. Before you put the envelope down you need to disinfect the surface with bleach. Once the envelope is complete you can either put it in another sealed ziplock (with other second hand clothes, and you could also try and get some hair from a barbers or something to put in there).. Or before doing this you could spray the envelope lightly with bleach to kill DNA (I am not sure if this actually works, and it may be possible that drug dogs could sniff for bleach which would be an obvious giveaway) - or expose it to bursts of ultraviolet light (I am not an expert but I have read that this can kill DNA). <br /><br />Don&#039;t go in to the post office, but if you absolutely must, buy a yellow flourescent jacket, some dark sunglasses, and a bicycle helmet. Wear latex gloves underneath another pair of gloves (ones that aren&#039;t so heavy you can&#039;t write with). For plausible deniability I would suggest actually posting an ad on gumtree or another services website stating that you are looking to run errands and act as a freelance courier. At the post office you will just look like a normal courier, and that is the story you should go with. <br /><br />But seriously, 100% do not go into the post office. It is absolutely a really stupid thing to do.
