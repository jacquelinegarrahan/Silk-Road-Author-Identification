				Quick question, from a person with limited knowledge of the specifics of Bitcoin mechanism, though with general programming and crypto knowledge --<br /><br />does anyone have any clue / has done any research (e.g. trying to trace the transactions) about how good SR&#039;s internal bitcoin tumbling system is? I might try to implement a very lightweight tumbling/mixing / blind BTC transaction thingie, but for now actually partly rely on SR&#039;s system, which from first inspection (via blockexplorer etc.) looks good.<br /><br />Anybody has any more info? If SR sees this - disclosing specifics is of course out of the question; but still, any info would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks<br />D.

				The SR mixing system might hide which vendor you ordered from (although it might not if you load a unique amount of money that is associated with a certain vendors product, or other similar things) but it doesn&#039;t hide the fact that you use SR. And it doesn&#039;t use blind signatures so it offers no protection from anyone who has pwnt SR or SR himself. I wouldn&#039;t put any faith in the SR mixing system keeping you anonymous, but it is better than nothing. Look into Open Transactions.

				Aye, thanks. Re: hiding the fact of using SR - yes, this is not the intention; the idea would be to e.g. use SR to detach the deposited bitcoins from the ones withdrawn (of course using more than one transaction per deposit/withdrawal, with scattered time and amounts), and I&#039;m not sure how good this is for that. Thanks, I know I have to take a proper look at OT, will do, actually.
