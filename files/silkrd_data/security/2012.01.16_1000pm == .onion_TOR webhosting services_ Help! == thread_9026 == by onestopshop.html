				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a anonymous web-hosting service that is cool with letting me list illegal wares (weed/hash/LSD/MDMA), anybody know of any websites or individuals that can help me out?<br /><br />I know freedom hosting is the main one but their invite only at the moment&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />would appreciate any help, maybe half a BTC thrown your way<br /><br />cheers!

				Why would you list it anywhere other than SR? AFAIK SR is the only place where people don&#039;t scam you. =/

				cmon man I don&#039;t want to get in a debate or piss people off about this I just want to know a web-host...and who said I wasn&#039;t going to list on SR *aswell*..?<br /><br />If you must know I&#039;ve been dealing successfully for years by following a simple business model:<br /><br />* providing higher quality goods at a lower cost then everyone else = guaranteed success *<br /><br />the commission/hedging fees will limit me in doing so making me a less competitive choice compared to the people who can be more flexible with their prices because they live in areas/countries where supply outstrips demand therefore multiple allowing discounted purchases of multiple kilos..<br /><br />plus there&#039;s a LOT of untapped business from The Hidden Wiki considering most vendors on there are scammers or phished links so the legit ones see a ton of business...<br />

You need to<br /><br />a) secure the VPS by disabling root logins, scp over your ssh login key for secure passwordless entry, set up iptables to only allow tor access, ect.<br /><br />Check torservers.net there&#039;s a guide there on how to setup a relay just tweak it around for a hidden service. You also need to disable server information so it doesn&#039;t leak, like removing lighttpd headers or google how to custom build nginx so you can wipe all the server information. May have to make custom 502/404 error pages as well so they don&#039;t show your IP &#039;Error.. this host is down. Host is: blahblah.. derp.. now everybody can find this server&#039;<br /><br />Just need to make sure you<br />a) always ssh through Tor to set it up<br />b) always pay in anonymous methods<br />c) always use anonymous email not used anywhere else to buy it<br /><br />So if you fucked up the configuration there&#039;s no way to find you. Make sure you aren&#039;t running some crazy PHP/SQL server with bitcoind on it either, or not gpg encrypting customer info put into any of your order forms.

				Should also note the hidden wiki is getting raped everyday by some donkey raping shiteater who keeps deleting all the source links. <br /><br />If you really want to increase business make a clearnet site using bulletproof hosting. 90% of the world can&#039;t figure out Tor/deepnet

				Budmail is just using a Malaysian host I think, primarily they are only peddling weed, and no USA or Sweden shipping which means nobody will come after them with a vengeance so it&#039;s fine for them.<br /><br />For selling MDMA/LSD is a different story though. I run a few .onion sites already they are easy to set up. Security is not paramount if you&#039;re just running a simple site with a link to your email to order, or an encrypted order form that generates a bitcoin pay-to address which it calls from a list of pre-generated bitcoin addresses (you keep bitcoind offline). What did you want? Full store/shopping cart running PHP/SQL then you&#039;ll need to lock down the host like crazy but if just an encrypted form w/a menu it&#039;s easy to set up I can tell you what to do.<br /><br />Clearnet bulletproof hosting is around 20WMZ/month for shared hosting in some CIS or Eastern European country that doesn&#039;t give a shit what you&#039;re doing as long as it&#039;s not spam or illegal porn. You can either use btc-e.com to withdraw directly to their WMZ account paying your bill or have somebody proxy pay them on bitcoin-otc IRC channel or bitcointalk forums.<br /><br />There is another trick if you want to be ballin. Advertise your product as &#039;Legal High Ecstasy&#039; and get a shady credit card processor to take payments. This legal high X is awesome! o wai it&#039;s real!! Then sell to Europe/UK (no USA shipments). You can attach anonymous ATM cards to payment processors so don&#039;t need it going to a real bank account. Or you can scheme up some way of having them fund a bitcoin account directly for you and cash out that way. <br /><br />Advertise in high times magazine ^_^
