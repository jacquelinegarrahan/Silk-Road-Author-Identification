				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I just got myself overexcited, bought 40 BTC and send them.... to a BTC Address I did not use for 7 Month&nbsp; :-\ This one was a silkroad address linked to my wallet. now 12 Hours later, not a single btc showed up. Are they lost? The SR Wiki saith that I can use all my old addresses, but until now it wont work and I get a little frightened, since this is a shitload of money for me which seems to be has gone down the drain.

				Check the block chain. Search for your bitcoin address on blockchain.info (over Tor). If the coins are there, you should get them in your account eventually.

				If it helps, I had the same issue today with a recently-used SR address and it looks like a few other people have had similar problems.&nbsp; I did check the blockchain though and did not find my transaction, which I find very worrying.&nbsp; The order status on the exchange site shows it as completed, too, which is more worrisome.&nbsp; Anyone know of any reason why it would have said it went through 16 hours ago, all my info was entered correctly, and I&#039;d still not have my funds?

				Is your wallet up to date , with confirmations &amp; shit?<br />When ii rushed in, and downloaeed a wallet on my desktop, put some money to that account, i had to wait over a week for it to catch up with the blockchain history.lmao.<br />Otherwise, get a verification email from who you bought the btc&#039;s with, they may even look into it for you, after all its in his interests to do so, if he is a reputable btc trader.<br />good luck slurp<br />

He told me that he send me the BTC and asked me to use my current wallet address next time&nbsp; :) He is so damn right&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So thanks DPR!&nbsp; :-* <br /><br />Problem solved for me.
