				So I was thinking I&#039;d buy one of paypal accounts some of the vendors you see on the hidden wiki sell. Once I got the paypal, I could use the money to turn it into more bitcoins. Only problem is, how do i go about doing that? A check or bank account wouldn&#039;t work for obvious reasons, and the first time I log into it, I imagine Im going to have about 2 days to get what I can from it before it gets shut down. I imagine transferring it straight into my legit paypal account would get me caught too. So to me, it seems there&#039;s three ways of laundering and withdrawing the money: buy as much stuff as possible with it on ebay, have it mailed to a nearby unihabited house; transfer it into online gaming anonymous currency; or get it turned straight into payapl. Could anyone be of help helping me with the last two methods?

If you just want to buy Bitcoins you can do this with cash. If you need to cash out i.e receive cash in the mail in exchange for Bitcoins there are many Bitcoin traders (myself included) who would be happy to help.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Whadda bout this idea?: Using the stolen paypal to buy amazon gift card codes on ebay, then sell the giftcards to a site that sends you a check for 92% of the card&#039;s value.

				I think you&#039;re missing the point. It&#039;s not worth the risk you&#039;re taking whether it be getting caught by the authorities or in buying an account with a zero balance.&nbsp; If you really want to go through with it, you could theoretically buy Linden dollars on VirWoX then convert them into BTC, but there is a 48 hour delay on cash out when you buy BTC with money from Paypal.

				-blink- Settle down, guys. :D<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a seller on eBay (all legit, and PayPal is too) since January and I just recently obtained the PayPal debit/credit card. I just take out cash from any ATM or debit cash out from a grocery store without using any &#039;membership card&#039; ... Then take the cash and rock out your average, anonymous get-bitcoin/bitinstant deposit. If you have a legit PayPal account, apply for the card. Only the most paranoid would think that this method is insecure. If I had a normal job with direct deposit into what would have to be a legit bank account, I&#039;d just be taking cash out of that bank&#039;s ATM. Basically the same liability, which I consider nearly zero.<br /><br />If you have eBay accounts anyway, just do one big fake sale, mark it shipped, eat the selling fees, and pay yourself that way. Doing anymore is just making more work for yourself without making it more anonymous. PayPal is not a good way to directly obtain BitCoins, just don&#039;t do it. Ever. That&#039;s really the only thing you have to worry about, I heard that&#039;s the only reason The Farmer&#039;s Market or whatever got owned, tons of PayPal transactions. Ugh.
