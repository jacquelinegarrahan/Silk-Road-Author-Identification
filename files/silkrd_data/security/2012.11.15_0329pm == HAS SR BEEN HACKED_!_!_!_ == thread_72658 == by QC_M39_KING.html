				How come you stir up trouble at every opportunity? How come nobody has accused you yet of being behind the trouble?<br /><br />How come you can&#039;t get it through your skull that you&#039;re not a welcome member of the community and you should fuck off?

				Fuck, this guy is annoying you&#039;ve officially become the most annoying person on this forum, how does that make you feel? Seriously, not one fucking thing you said has made a lick of sense over the past week and the bad thing about it is you&#039;re so fucking stupid you can&#039;t even see it, and you call us the sheep? Oh, the irony. <br /><br />I can only imagine you&#039;re not a day over 20, probably dropped out of school extremely early and all around just a fuck up. I mean, who has to constantly inflate their anonymous ego online, like you do? Who fucking does that...let me answer that for you, kids trying to be something they&#039;re not, like yourself. In the chance that you are possibly over the age of 18, I&#039;m pretty sure you are autistic and should seek medical help, it can only help you at this point.<br />
