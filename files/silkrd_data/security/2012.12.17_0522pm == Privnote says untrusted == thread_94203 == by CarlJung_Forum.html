				I never experienced a problem w/privnote b4 (I have 10.6.8 on Mac OS, and GHP is buggy here), but just now got a Dilogue saying &quot;Untrustworthy&quot; certificate probs, etc.. Anyone ever hear of this?<br /><br />

				That sounds like an SSL certificate problem. Usually it&#039;s just expired or something. You shouldn&#039;t trust privnote in the first place, that&#039;s just one more reason. Find a way to use GPG on your mac....or wait for priv to fix the problem. I suggest the first option.

				just ran into same problem, sent trusted vendor (though i have not communicated w/vendor for a couple months) a shipping related question encrypted, did not bother to include my pub key as i did not think the answer would be sensitive. now i got vendor reply which is a privnote link. i don&#039;t know shiite about privnote, tried the link, got the untrusted page, then came to forums, did a quick search and read a little bit and am now even more sketched out about it. didn&#039;t bother trying link again, just sent reply w/my pub key asking vendor resend reply encrypted. am i right in thinking it is a security risk for me to use the privnote link to read vendor reply, or am i just making a pest of myself to what has been a good vendor in the past? please reply if you have actual knowledge on the subject, would be happy for some education/info on this.

				The site&#039;s SSL certificate has expired.&nbsp; Here are the warnings I get from both Firefox and Chome: <br /><br />Firefox&#039;s Warning<br />==============<br /><br />This Connection is Untrusted<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />You have asked Firefox to connect securely to privnote.com, but we can&#039;t <br />confirm that your connection is secure.<br /><br />Normally, when you try to connect securely, sites will present trusted <br />identification to prove that you are going to the right place. However, <br />this site&#039;s identity can&#039;t be verified.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />What Should I Do?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />If you usually connect to this site without problems, this error could mean <br />that someone is trying to impersonate the site, and you shouldn&#039;t continue.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />privnote.com uses an invalid security certificate.<br /><br />The certificate expired on 12/17/2012 01:17 PM. The current time is [snip]<br /><br />(Error code: sec_error_expired_certificate)<br /><br /><br />Chrome&#039;s Warning<br />================<br /><br />The site&#039;s security certificate has expired!<br /><br />You attempted to reach www.privnote.com, but the server presented an expired <br />certificate. No information is available to indicate whether that certificate <br />has been compromised since its expiration. This means Google Chrome cannot <br />guarantee that you are communicating with www.privnote.com and not an <br />attacker. Your computer&#039;s clock is currently set to [date/time snipped] <br /><br />Does that look right? If not, you should correct the error and refresh this <br />page.<br /><br />You should not proceed, especially if you have never seen this warning <br />before for this site.<br /><br />[Proceed anyway] [ Back to safety]<br /><br />Help me understand<br /><br />When you connect to a secure website, the server hosting that site presents <br />your browser with something called a &quot;certificate&quot; to verify its identity. <br />This certificate contains identity information, such as the address of the <br />website, which is verified by a third party that your computer trusts. By <br />checking that the address in the certificate matches the address of the <br />website, it is possible to verify that you are securely communicating with <br />the website you intended, and not a third party (such as an attacker on your <br />network).<br /><br />For a certificate which has not expired, the issuer of that certificate is <br />responsible for maintaining something called a &quot;revocation list&quot;. If a <br />certificate is ever compromised, the issuer can revoke it by adding it to <br />the revocation list, and then this certificate will no longer be trusted by <br />your browser. Revocation status is not required to be maintained for expired <br />certificates, so while this certificate used to be valid for the website <br />you&#039;re visiting, at this point it is not possible to determine whether the <br />certificate was compromised and subsequently revoked, or whether it remains <br />secure. As such it is impossible to tell whether you&#039;re communicating with <br />the legitimate website, or whether the certificate was compromised and is <br />now in the possession of an attacker with whom you are communicating.<br /><br />NC<br />
