				So I made a deposit using bitinstant, and its been about an hour, and still no coins in my bitstamp account.<br /><br />Do I need to contact bitinstant if I don&#039;t see any money soon? This is really bugging me out. I live paycheck to paycheck and have some pretty serious anxiety issues which I NEED benzo&#039;s for. I really need this money in my account soon. Does anyone have any suggestions or dealt with a similar problem and can help me relax and not think I&#039;m losing 100 bucks for no reason??

				You can also try posting in the bitinstant thread in the new member section on bitcointalk.org ... the bitinstant owner is there often and sometimes issues get dealt with more quickly that way.

				<br />Grab the Quote ID# or the ZipZap account # you used.&nbsp; Then go to (clearnet warning - don&#039;t do this on Tor) https://bitcointalk.org, register for an account, and go to the Newbie sub-board.&nbsp; There you will find the Official Bitinstant Customer Support thread.&nbsp; Post your info there, tell them the problem, and their CEO will very likely personally respond to your post.&nbsp; If you feel like you&#039;re getting nowhere, send a PM to Yankee (that&#039;s the bitinstant CEO), and basically give him all those same details again.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get your funds, and if bitinstant screwed up you&#039;ll get your fee back.&nbsp; Happy hunting.<br /><br />(edited out my pissy attitude)

				No money in my account yet. Its been about 15 hours. I got an email back from support saying that nthey ran out of BTC reserves and will fill the order asap.<br /><br />FUCK BITINSTANT<br /><br />If they didn&#039;t have BTC&#039;s, they should have been accepting orders. I used a different BTC trading site and I already bought my BTC and have them on the way to SR. In the meantime, I have $100 bucks in limbo somewhere in bitinstant&#039;s clusterfuck of a company.

				Not sure it is a good idea to post actual transaction #s, May want to modify OP to make them similar to actual ones if they are actual. May need to track down anyone who quoted them as well if worried about it. I could just be being parranoid.<br /><br />It looks like the error message may be saying you did not have enough dollars in the account for the amount you tried to buy. That may just be bad actions by Bitinstant though. They have had a lot of complaints in the forum last few days.

Bitinstant support sent me a response saying something about them being low on BTC and that they will do it manually....eventually I guess. Were gonna be going on 24 hours soon. Personally, I&#039;d stay away from bitinstant right now. I know bitcopia.com uses wells fargo, the exchange I used uses BOA as well.

I just wanted to make an order last night, and obviously bluesky isn&#039;t open 24/7, so bitinstant was my only option. I wish I checked the forums to see the current state of bitinstant, I would have never even thought of going near them right now. I had to make another smaller deposit with another exchange, dipping into my savings which I fucking HATE to do, but unfortunately I need my benzo&#039;s or else I&#039;m a miserable guy. Going by what everyone is saying over on some BTC forums, I could be in for a wait that I have to measure in DAYS....

				Just to update, I woke up this morning with the money in my account. It took a little over 24 hours, but it got there. I bitched and complained on another forum and it apparently worked, as there have been people waiting days for their cash.

				Update on Bitinstant&#039;s page:<br /><br />The BTC-e, Bitstamp and Bitcoin address and Bitcoin-to-email options are temporarily offline for system updates. These options should be back up on Monday, February 25. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience while we run these upgrades.
