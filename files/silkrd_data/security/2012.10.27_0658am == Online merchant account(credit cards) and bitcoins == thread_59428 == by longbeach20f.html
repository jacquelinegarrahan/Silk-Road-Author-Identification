				I am curious. You cant buy bitcoins with credit cards(directly). This is, from what i know, because websites who sell bitcoins, end up getting slammed with stolen cc details and they thus lose their merchant account for processing credit card payments, and money(?).<br /><br />However, what happens if you open up a site that sells a product different from bitcoins(but relatable, maybe some other kind of currency, or valuable item) and then, after the 3rd party CC processing company has approved your site and given you a checkout feature, you add bitcoins to your product list?<br /><br />I mean... the problem is chargebacks, right? Because you sent out items that you cant retrieve(bitcoins).<br /><br />What i dont really understand, and excuse me if this seems stupid, but how can a merchant be accountable for the fact that people used stolen credit cards on there website? If I as a merchant send out a product, whether its bitcoin or not, how am i responsible for whether or not credit cards used to buy my product were stolen or not? To me, it just appears as a sale, and thus i send the product out? <br /><br />I mean sure, maybe you&#039;d lose access to using that 3rd party CC processing company, but they cant take your money just because some people, possibly a minority or maybe not, used stolen info, can they? And once its transferred from the CC processor to your bank account, its fully in the clear?<br /><br />Sorry if this sounds stupid, I just dont understand how the whole world can simply deny the sale of a product via legitimate means?

Visa/Mastercard can stick it to small business because Visa/Mastercard can. One day when cash has been outlawed you will have to sacrifice a goat in Visa/Mastercards name if you want to continue doing business.

				It&#039;s because you can&#039;t physically ship the coins to the cardholders address, which is the basic rule for online card payments.<br />Credit card companies can indeed take money back out of a bank account by means of chargeback and the business would quickly go bust rather than lose their merchant account.<br />I&#039;ve been looking into merchant accounts recently and there&#039;s no rule to stop you selling bitcoins and taking card payments, you&#039;d just be stupid to do it without other safeguards in place :)

				How does physically not sending items stop you? E-books account for billions of dollars a year in sales, so does online music, so does many other &#039;E&#039; objects. None of those companies or products are taken off the market/not accepted by CC.<br /><br />And what if you send bitcoins with a physical item, like a paper clip? Buy one paper clip at the price of 140USD and get 10 bitcoins free! Sort of thing.
