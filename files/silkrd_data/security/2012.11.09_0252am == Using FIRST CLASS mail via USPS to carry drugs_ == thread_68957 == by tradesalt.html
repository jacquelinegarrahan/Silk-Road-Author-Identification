				Hey, so First Class mail requires a warrant to be opened by any law enforcement, and is very hard to obtain said warrants unless they have been doing a big investigation on you or somesuch. I was just wondering, as long as you are transporting a product short distances (within the same city), wouldn&#039;t it be a good idea to have it stored in the First Class sealed mail? As long as you have no other suspicious reason for a cop to just randomly assume your mail has drugs in it (ludicrous), no cop would be able to arrest you and somehow obtain a warrant to open the item.<br /><br />I mean, it would literally have to have a drug dog alert on the envelope for them to even think of it, let alone get a warrant for it. <br /><br />This way, you can hide things in plain sight. Hell, just have it with some other mail, and you were going to drop it off on your way home/whatever.

				For me, the USPS scares me quite a bit.&nbsp; Everything bit of wrongdoing about the US mail is a felony.&nbsp; Using that felony to support another felony?! Something like the following runs through my head when I think about it: &quot;Mis-using the United States&#039; postal service... to ship illegal&nbsp; drugs... across state lines... , felony ,felony, felony ,felony,&quot; <br /><br />Also, the USPS is obligated to service you, they don&#039;t care if they lose your business.&nbsp; So, when the USPS cracks down on drugs it&#039;s for real.&nbsp; Whereas, FedEx wants your business and won&#039;t go snooping.&nbsp; Sure, FedEx will cooperate with the Feds but believe me they&#039;re not looking to lose business, nor to stall business, nor to complicate business, etc.<br /><br />That&#039;s my thoughts.&nbsp; Others?

				1) Use the search feature, there have been dozens of discussions on this.<br />2) The general consensus is that using USPS first class is the safest method. This is because of the much stricter regulations USPS must follow in order to search a package.<br />3) The argument over caring about your business is moot. UPS, Fed-Ex and the USPS are all far too large to turn a blind eye in order to keep one customer&#039;s business.

				Tradesalt -<br />&nbsp;<br />I may be mistaken, but an envelope with a stamp does not qualify as first class mail. It would need to be processed by the post office before is carries a legal definition and protection form unlawful search. However, your person and belongings are protected form unlawful search as well. Unless you are arrested or an officer has probably cause they can not search you or your belongings without your permission to begin with.
