				Ok so when I first stumbled upon this amazing site I was completely uninitiated in the ways of anonymity. Being such a noob I was not aware of the many ways to hide my activities. I used the tor browser directly from my desktop and had only one bitcoin wallet that was also downloaded directly to my desktop. I am now making the switch to a tails usb, but I realize there is a lot of incriminating evidence already saved into my computer&#039;s memory. So I was wondering how I could go about purging my system of any illegal activity. I know that there are programs that can be used to do some of this but as I am not sure as to their effectiveness. Does any one have any suggestions or advice to give me.

				the best program is a bucket of water and you throw the harddrives in it and start over with some new ones<br /><br />

				You can partition and reformat your hard drive. You&#039;ll need to re-install your OS, but at least any incriminating data will be permanently deleted.

				Lol it seems like it. But technically even then my hard drive would still have the information on it and it could be recovered. The water would just ruin my desktop not remove the information contained on the hard drive. So couldn&#039;t it just be dried out and another machine used to access my removed hard drive?

I don&#039;t remember what it was but I&#039;ve heard of a program that lets you select files from your system, deletes them like normal, and then writes over them multiple times to make it harder to recover the original data. Has anyone heard of this or is it just a pipe dream?

				I think partitioning and reformatting have become a lot easier than it used to be. I guess it also depends on which OS you&#039;re running. On linux it&#039;s super easy, you can probably do it with four seperate commands and you&#039;re ready to load the OS.<br /><br />BTW- I haven&#039;t heard of that software before, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised. People come up with all sorts of creative ways to accomplish anything with computers

				Wow every single person in this thread is giving horrible advice. Throwing your HD in a bucket of water doesn&#039;t accomplish jack shit. Reinstalling an OS doesn&#039;t accomplish much at all either, it only overwrites some data. To clean your drive you need to use Secure Erase, preferably followed by a single pass of random data from DBAN.

				You can download an iso of Darik&#039;s Boot and Nuke CD from www.dban.org which can securely wipe your hard disk (1 pass or multi with patterns), before whatever partitioning or reinstalling you plan to do.

				That&#039;s funny, I&#039;ve always thought it did. The DBAN site says data removal isn&#039;t guaranteed so I guess you&#039;d be taking your chances with both. Maybe the best way is a hammer and a nail.
