I will deny everything and lets hope things go well. Just moved here from cali so i have no idea what my rights are in finland. Fuck!

				In the meantime im shitting my pants wondering if they&#039;ll get a search warrant. Gotta clear out the grow room (cries).

				Gnome,<br /><br />Make sure you ALWAYS check their ID&#039;s and find out from what Agency they represent. Then make sure you speak to some legal counsel, you just moved to Finland so you most likey are unfamiliar with their legal system.<br /><br />You are also mistaken, Finland&#039;s customs are very efficent and are on par with Australia.<br /><br />Don&#039;t waste any time! Destroy all evidence of drug use NOW!<br /><br />God speed to you. I hope it all works out, please play the game in a smart way.

				I went in for questioning and turns out they only had found 2 of the orders weed and dmt. They didnt know what the dmt was but had seized it because it was from the same country as the weed. Exchangeservice had wrapped it in newspaper i guess so it was easy to find? Not sure, not blaming anyone just happy i didnt get in more trouble. Since they couldn&#039;t prove i ordered it, they just let me go.

				Did ever have a profile in a social network or similar?<br /><br />Talk with your lawyer, but, I think you can say you put all your personal info in a profile at once and you suspect somebody stole your information.<br /><br />And for me, that&#039;s half true. When I had facebook, ICQ, orkut, twitter and this kind of stuff, I had put there my real address, phone and these kind of things.

				Without an admission of guilt, they have NOTHING.&nbsp; LEO&#039;s job in this case is to go fishing.&nbsp; The reason they did not take you immediately was they did not have enough on you.&nbsp; The other reason is to give you time to break down so they can get an easy confession.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unless the LEO has been watching you or you are a BIG timer, this is as far as most interactions in any country will go.&nbsp; If you break down, you are busted.&nbsp; If you are released, you were calm and in control during the interview.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would not send any goods to this address for quite sometime, perhaps never, just to be safe.&nbsp; Could you if needed, IMO certainly but with a slightly elevated risk.&nbsp; Just bear in mind that since they talked to you, dozens of other people have fucked up by trying to talk their way out it or just straight-up admitting it, thus going to jail and filling arrest quotas.&nbsp; There are always easier fish to fry daily and most won&#039;t pass that interview you successfully endured.

There are countless threads which reiterate the reasons. As hundreds of posts have said, if the packaging is done correctly, professionally, and vacuum sealed, your real name and address, with personal amounts, blends perfectly in with the rest of your mail.

				@happytree<br />I reading that thread yet. Where is the post he says its better not use a fake name. I think if it is the name of the previous resident of the house (if you still receiving his correspondence) could be a good idea anyway.<br /><br />But if it&#039;s better use your true name, what&#039;s the utility of a P.O.

				I would read the entirety of the &quot;Postal Inspector Ask Me Anything&quot; thread. All of these scenarios/questions are asked and answered at length.<br /><br />The P.O. Box option is difficult (but not impossible) to use a fake name, because you must present ID documents when opening, but it&#039;s possible. <br /><br />The purpose of a P.O. Box is that if a LE sting is set up, the would not likely have the time/wherewithal to sit and wait for days for you to come retrieve your package. But you never know.<br /><br />Again, read all the shipping/safety threads, and Postal Inspector ones, for what you think is your best bet.
