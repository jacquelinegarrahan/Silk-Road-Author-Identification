				Anybuddy? I&#039;ve been on the site messaging one of their employees and it seems pretty legit. 2% fee and many banks to choose from (I chose Bank of America) the one downfall is that they DO run out of bitcoins for certain banks..<br /><br />FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Buying bitcoins with Bitcoin-Brokers is easy. The bitcoins that we sell you have been placed for sale on our site by individual sellers. The sellers provide us with their personal banking information. Bitcoin-Brokers handles the sale of the bitcoins, handles the communications and directs buyers to make cash deposits into these seller&#039;s bank accounts.<br /><br />By setting it up this way, Bitcoin-Brokers never touches the cash. The buyer simply pays the seller directly. This is a free service to the seller, and the buyer incurs a 2% fee. All quoted rates for bitcoins are always based on current MtGox rates.<br /><br />That&#039;s it. There is no sign up, or registration. We do not collect any ID. All you have to do when you want to buy bitcoins, is simply respond to this ticket, and I will always be here to offer you a current quote as well as the appropriate banking information for the seller&#039;s account.<br /><br />After you have made a cash-only deposit into the seller&#039;s bank account you will need to collect proof of the deposit you have just made. You will need to obtain the deposit receipt, as well as the business card of the teller.<br /><br />Those two items will need to be photographed and then uploaded as an attachment to this same ticket we are using right now. Once that is forwarded to Bitcoin-Brokers, I inspect it, and then forward it to the seller as confirmation of the deposit. It is at this time that I also make a request from the seller to release the escrowed bitcoin. Once this authorization is granted, I transfer your bitcoin to your wallet.<br /><br />The seller has 24 hours to authorize a release of the bitcoin, though 99% of the time the bitcoin is authorized to be released much sooner than 24 hours.<br /><br />On the off chance that the seller fails to reply to the request, Bitcoin-Brokers already has the bitcoin escrowed in our wallet, and we will simply complete the transfer of the bitcoin to you on behalf of the seller. You are always guaranteed to get your bitcoin when you buy them at Bitcoin-Brokers.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ALSO here is a forum with reviews... once again seems pretty legit<br /><br />(clearnet) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=237164.0<br /><br />hope this helps<br /><br />who am i kidding... I KNOW this helped
