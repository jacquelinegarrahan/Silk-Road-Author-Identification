				How long before the long arm of the law catches up for money laundering?&nbsp; Does anyone know how their algorythms work in determining which account have &quot;suspicious&quot; activity?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of a topix vendor getting busted for drugs, but what about money laundering?

				Thank you for that, Guru.<br /><br />It&#039;s amazing that they were able to track the reload cards to the identity of the debit card which redeemed it.

				Or it could have been a frequent shopper card. A local murder suspect bought tape and plastic with cash but scanned his shopper card. He got caught.

				You can&#039;t use any other form of payment on here other than BTC so this is pretty much a moot-point. If you want to get yourself nicked and maybe get your vendor account locked then you could use GDMP.<br /><br />Also to answer your original question I am not sure where you think agencies like the IRS and HMRC are in terms of money laundering but they aren&#039;t stupid, in fact ML techniques are one of the most rapidly shifting types of crime because of this reason. Also using GDMP wont actually wash your funds, you will just be left with unaccountable hard cash which, if the shit hits the fan and you are raided, is after drugs the polices second favourite type of evidence. Money to go with the drugs = prosecutors wet dream. <br /><br />If you want to launder your money properly you have to actually sometimes have to invest more money than you do the business that you are receiving the black proceeds from and then you have to be disciplined enough to learn how to manipulate your infrastructure successfully. <br /><br />I hope this sheds some light on the subject.

I don&#039;t even take on all those that come and find me, if I think they aren&#039;t committed, I turn them down. <br /><br />And Wana-Be I think you need to realize now that any form of money-laundering costs money. The whole &quot;Yeah can I get it for free&quot; is just going to set you back because you are just looking at a process that is inherently costly with poor-man&#039;s spectacles on. Like I said I only work with truly committed vendors and now that you have asked for a cheap option I probably wouldn&#039;t work with you.
