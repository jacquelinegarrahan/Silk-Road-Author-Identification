				Basically this is the message: <br />&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I&#039;m not sure if you are the right person or not, but I live near to you and have noticed you making quite a few deliveries to the mailbox, some of which I managed to get on video... search for &#039;silk road local delivery&#039; on www.videoupload.us and click on the the first video and you will be able to see.<br /><br />This is not a threat, I am just trying to pre warning you to be more careful when mailing things (and maybe send someone else to the mailbox instead of yourself)<br /><br />P.S If it is not you in the video, then you can ignore this<br /><br />Simon&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />My reaction &quot; HAHA&quot;. Why?<br />1. My drop offs do not involve mail boxes at all. In fact I never come near a mail box, and no not telling you how. But first off I knew this was not me<br />2. How the hell would he know this is me, and who would go through that much work to message every single vendor in the country (assuming he did this --&gt; unless he specifically targeted me <br /><br /><br />Now, my curiosity got the better of me, I opened it in Tor. Soon as I saw a java script appalet I CLOSED IT RIGHT AWAY! <br />The reason is because extensions like Java and other addons can be used to track you, EVEN IN TOR! <br /><br />For those of you who are unaware:<br /><br />Tor does not protect all of your computer&#039;s Internet traffic when you run it. Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you&#039;re browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.<br />Don&#039;t enable or install browser plugins<br /><br />The Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and privacy. The lack of plugins means that Youtube videos are blocked by default, but Youtube does provide an experimental opt-in feature (enable it here) that works for some videos.<br /><br /><br />Tor will encrypt your traffic to and within the Tor network, but the encryption of your traffic to the final destination website depends upon on that website. To help ensure private encryption to websites, the Tor Browser Bundle includes HTTPS Everywhere to force the use of HTTPS encryption with major websites that support it. However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a blue or green URL bar button, include https:// in the URL, and display the proper expected name for the website.<br /><br />Don&#039;t open documents downloaded through Tor while online<br />The Tor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are handled by external applications. DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING. You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files) as these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP address. If you must work with DOC and/or PDF files, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, downloading the free VirtualBox and using it with a virtual machine image with networking disabled, or using Tails. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together, however.<br />Use bridges and/or find company<br /><br />Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you&#039;re using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a Tor bridge relay rather than connecting directly to the public Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!<br /><br /><br /><br />So I still want to see this video, so I head over to an internet cafe across the street. Try and load it, and it is just a continuous java running in the background with nothing occurring. My conclusion?<br />THIS IS LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTEMPTING TO TRACK VENDORS THROUGH TOR! DO NOT OPEN THIS LINK! DO NOT ENABLE JAVA!<br /><br />If mods can sticky this or get support to send a warning out, would suck to see a bunch of vendors go down like this. I mean I hate competition, but I ain&#039;t gonna wish death on nobody. There ain&#039;t no coming back from that ;) <br /><br /><br /><br />My advice for anyone who clicked the link and had java on --&gt; clean your house for a while, just to be safe. Hate to see you go down like this. <br /><br /><br />

				The site doesn&#039;t show up in a Google search. This an attack that I&#039;ve predicted in the many times I&#039;ve said not to visit links posted on this forum over clearnet. The attacker knows that only people on SR know about his site, so anyone who visits over clearnet has linked their IP address (and possibly their identity) to the fact that they use SR.<br /><br />The Java app is probably supposed to phone home to expose the IP addresses of Tor users.<br />

				Opening that URL automatically gets picked up by anti-virus and the java applet is prevented from running. I assume that means the IP can&#039;t be traced? After anti-virus picks it up, it just doesn&#039;t load the website, rather, it just leaves it as if you&#039;ve opened a new tab. I posted this in other threads on the matter, but I thought I&#039;d spread it across to get more viewpoints.

				That is confirmed malware. I just spoke to someone who visited that site, actually ran the Java, and now multiple anti-virus programs detect malware on his computer where there was none before.<br /><br />Now to determine whether it&#039;s LE or some random asshole who wants to install keyloggers to steal account credentials, or possibly enumerate the IP addresses of vendors and blackmail them.<br />

				To stop obvious scams like this, it might be useful to give vendors the option to disallow messages from users who both don&#039;t have enough money in their accounts to buy their cheapest item and have made no purchases. It should be enabled by default.

				A friend had some extremely strange shit happen to them yesterday while browsing over Tor/SR, Vidalia crashed with an application error (see log below) so they rebooted the system and upon reloading found that Malwarebytes Anti-Malware had its definitions and some critical program files DELETED, that had to be re-installed. MSSE, Super Anti-Spyware, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware &amp; Spybot Search/Destroy all fully updated to latest definitions have found no malware on this system, I&#039;d like to check to see if my friend has visited this site over clearnet for some stupid reason and not told me about it.<br /><br />Vidalia log - strange never seen this before!

It may be nothing at all, but i&#039;d like to be sure that their system is clean, this whole thing is just way too much of a coincidence... I might just do a low level format of their drive and re-install Winblows - and suggest they only visit SR through Tails.<br /><br />(edit - got the site name - www.video******.us - thanks...)<br /><br />(edit 2 - i&#039;ll re-scan the system with some different scanners, apparently MBAM &amp; SAS don&#039;t recognize the virus)

				Java rootkits are all the rage these days. Totally disable and delete Java if you really don&#039;t need it and don&#039;t ever click on suspect links. As a default, the Tor browser setup should be able to completely cut off Java since it&#039;s so compromising and dangerous. I guess that&#039;ll be the next step for Tor Project.

				Ask him to check his system processes under Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del). I check this regularly to see if anything is running in there that shouldn&#039;t be.<br /><br />Running antivirus like something from Malwarebytes, and TDSSKiller from Kaspersky after a thorough scan, will expose and tear apart all known rootkits that I&#039;ve ever come across. All viruses and rootkits operate the same way and exposes themselves pretty easily. The only question is, how do they hide on your system and how do they replicate? A lot will bury themselves deep in regular system directories and mark themselves as hidden. They all need a foothold in the registry too. Even if you manage to delete them, they&#039;ll replicate and copy themselves elsewhere. The task manager and registry editor are generally disabled by some rootkits to prevent identification and removal. A well written rootkit is a real bitch to remove manually.<br /><br />The right antivirus setup with enough monitoring from you will be able to prevent any infections before they even start. Download a good boot CD too. It&#039;ll save your system one of these days. Count on it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1151910#msg1151910">Quote from: Fallkniven on May 21, 2013, 10:37 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Friend said that they had no trouble whatsoever before this &#039;crash&#039;, everything was apparently working well.

One program can&#039;t read another program and decide whether it will continue forever or stop after a while (see Wikipedia: halting problem) so it has no chance of knowing a program&#039;s intentions.<br /><br />The only way to prevent viruses and trojans is to have every program signed by someone who is trusted to decide what you can and can&#039;t run, and if Microsoft decided that for you then I bet they wouldn&#039;t let you run Tor.<br /><br />I agree with astor though in that antivirus programs are snake oil, the entire industry is built on top of Windows being shit and the fear that it causes.

				If you think this is something new, then how come this rootkit is readily detectable by 31 out of 47 antivirus apps after being around for only 5 days?<br /><br />The fact is this is NOT something new. The only thing fairly new about it is that it&#039;s a Java applet, which has been a very popular way of infecting PCs over the past couple of months. Other than that, it writes to the registry and disk, then replicates itself when you find it and try to delete it. That&#039;s standard rootkit behavior. People here have gone about disinfecting their systems in the same way that others have when dealing with other rootkits.<br /><br />Its purpose may very well be to unmask Tor users, but it obviously wasn&#039;t very successful because everyone noticed it right away. If anything, this event reinforces the need for a VPN for times when shit like this happens.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1152008#msg1152008">Quote from: quixotist on May 21, 2013, 11:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161802.msg1151960#msg1151960">Quote from: Baraka on May 21, 2013, 10:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Ask him to check his system processes under Task Manager (ctrl-alt-del).
