			<dd class="postbody">
				Yesterday I decided to try the new bitcoin to email option, and thought I&#039;d post my findings/experience here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve previously used their service to send funds to CryptoXChange. While that works pretty well, I don&#039;t really trust CryptoXChange because you have to register (even if you just give them fake details, that still bothers me) and more importantly, you can&#039;t access your account via TOR. So I was curious to see that bitinstant has a new option: bitcoins to an email address. Basically the way this works is you deposit cash at a bank, and then partnering with another company called coinapult, they will give you a link where you can enter the address you want your coins to go to. I decided to do a test run with $50 USD.<br /><br />First, I started the transaction on bitinstant. I provided them with my tormail address. Bitinstant charged a fee of 3.99% + $1.0 USD, so that left me with a total of $47. Once you finish your transaction, you are directed to a company called Trust Cash. They&#039;re the ones that facilitate the cash deposit to bitinstant. They charged a fee of $1.16, but they just tack that on to the deposit. So the total amount I had to deposit was $51.16.<br /><br />Within twenty minutes of making the deposit at Bank of America, I got an email from Coinapult with a link where I could get my bitcoins. I went to this link, and it had a form asking for the bitcoin address I wanted the funds to go to, and asking for my PIN (this was created when I started the transaction at bitinstant).<br /><br />I provided them with a new bitcoin address at bitcoin fog. It took two hours for the coins to show up in my bitcoin fog account. Next, I scheduled a withdraw that would last twelve hours to my SR address. (Also freshly generated).<br /><br />I checked my account this morning, and found $44.85 had been deposited.<br /><br />Overall, I think this will be my new purchasing method for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.) It allows me to use TOR for all websites I need to visit<br />2.) I don&#039;t have to register for an account anywhere<br />3.) Nothing in any of the steps (except the final purchase of course) could be tied to my real identity.<br /><br />The bitcoin fog step takes a minimum of six hours, but as long as you plan ahead, I don&#039;t think that would be a problem, especially considering the extra layer of anonymity it provides you. The part that involved bitinstant and coinapult took less than twenty minutes total, and worked perfectly.

				great report! i&#039;m just curious on how much the BTC was traded to you for.<br /><br />like what price does BitInstant use.... (mtgox ave?). <br /><br />I just don&#039;t want to get stuck depositing say $50, and only get $45 worth of BTC when I get it transferred to SR

				They use the standard exchange rate (which fluctuates based on the market). The reason I ended up with about $5 less than I originally deposited was because each site takes a 1-3% fee for the transaction. There&#039;s no way around this, as you&#039;d have to pay a fee no matter how you get your bitcoins. I just adjust for this by depositing about $15 more than I actually want to end up in my SR account.<br /><br />But to answer you more specifically, I originally got 9.05 BTC (which is spot on for $47)

				alright sweet deal. i knew that bitcoin fog used 1-3% but I&#039;m glad you confirmed that you got the correct amount before laundering the coins. thanks again for the update.

				I use it a few times works great.........but for sellers maybe they should not be too keen to be seen depositing money for bitcoins or even wires as a TOR connection and Bank deposit for Bitcoins is an immediate red flag I think to be put on a list and possible mail check......all the hassles to deal with which is why I don&#039;t care just buy by the gram or something..........

				Just finished up 1st transaction with Bitinstant earlier this week. Went to back to make deposit, grabbed lunch and came home to coins then ran through fog. Seems to be spot on for amount I bought.

				I think it&#039;s an added layer, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a necessary one. I dunno though, some people probably do. I think bitinstant to email via cash deposit at a walmart while grocery shopping is anonymous enough.

However, the minimum *required* time is only six hours. Even if you only use the minimum required time, it still adds a nice layer of security, because it will transfer your total in random chunks at random intervals, which makes it harder to track.<br /><br />It may be paranoid, but the reason I&#039;m so concerned with making an already anonymous transaction difficult to track is, because I&#039;m sure my face shows up on numerous security cameras at the bank. I&#039;d like to make it as difficult as feasibly possible for them to track the transaction back to Trust Cash, and subsequently the bank I made the deposit at. I live in&nbsp; a larger city, but I think in some localities, that would be enough to figure out who they were looking for.

				The 2% BTCFog fee is not for me honestly... I know it&#039;s probably a lot safer but I just bribe diff people with drugs to do the deposits for me.
