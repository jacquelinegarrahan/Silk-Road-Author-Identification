				First of all, I&#039;m sorry if this has answered at legth before elswhere. This is another &quot;is my itsec ok&quot; thread. Sorry it&#039;s got so long. Used Throwaway acct 4 security.<br /><br />#tor<br />Ok so I made first mistake - access SR through Tor Browser bundle, wisened up.<br />I&#039;m on a Mac. Got TAILS to work (don&#039;t tell me liberte is better I can&#039;t get it to work). Have 0 purchases, so gonna nuke my hd before, run TAILS now. <br />TAILS has not the new tor security fix - concerns?<br /><br />#gpg/pgp<br />Don&#039;t worry, I figured asymmetrical keys out. But, problems: I do have to physically store my keys (mine, vendors&#039;), as I&#039;m struggling w/ encryption via TAILS, I&#039;m honestly too dumb to activate truecrypt w/ TAILS!! So i just keep my USB key holding the keys well hidden (just like my stash, can&#039;t encrypt your stash LOL). Suggestions for discrete key servers or better using keys w/ TAILS, does that exist?<br />Plus pgp will only go so far…protect you from SR gone &quot;bad&quot; not vendors addy harvesting… it&#039;s just another layer of sec and peace of mind. Right? <br /><br /># MAC address spoofing<br />no idea - let the flame wars begin :.-( I order via home wifi or some friends ethernet when there - maybe someone explain AGAIN in noob lingo why not do dis?<br /><br /># getting physical mail deliverd<br />= real (maybe mine maybe not mine) name, real address, (Mop n Pop P.O. box unavailable), anyboy can send anything to anybody to set them up. You know the deal. Not a seller.<br /><br /># RL<br />IRL I&#039;m not a known druggie, dont deal etc. Not having had to deal w/ cops ever. would be genuinely horrified upon bust. Of course I try my best so nothing case-related will get out of my mouth, FUCK my life is at stake so i&#039;ll play accordingly!!!! The enemy will not be helped (I know easy said, not easily done). <br /><br />#getting btc<br />greatest problem: i have only a semi-anon route (don&#039;t purchase them direcly, more deatils would be security risk). Dedicated FININT would easily track that i acquired some, but I guess I&#039;m WAYYYY too small. <br /><br />#country<br />I AM NOT IN THE USA! so no DEA etc. (?) no more detail for security so please dont recommend moneypak vendors (what IS that anyway). <br /><br />#SR<br />I have lurked a bit and over the last month or so, seen the tone here got more hostile due to all these busts. I&#039;d like to help SR be safer but noobishness doesn&#039;t help. <br />My thoughts on security so far are, you can beef up IT sec beyond any normal persons or low level LE&#039;s comprehension. <br />Still someone will infiltrate and snoop or intercept packages. Read the ER (Euphoricknowledge) stuff again.Trust and getting too big as a single seller/importer and fucking Skype, cim, you name it, brings ya down. Same: TFM. Don&#039; get cocky. <br />Let&#039;s enjoy SR while it lasts and NEVER FORGET IT HAS EXISTED A FUCKING LONG TIME (for an internet thing at least). MAY SR LIVE LONG AND PROSPER (uhhh seriously baaaad trekkie quote ew - but I mean it). <br />And DPR and crew I wish ya massive cashout :) sadly it prlly won&#039;t match the wallst gangster ones<br /><br />tl;dr: n00b, getting semi anon bc, deleted hd, TAILS, no clue where to store keys. Prepared for worst. BUT FUCKIN LOOOOOVES SR!!!!! <br /><br />Would really apprechiate answers. Come on, flame me...any answer is appreciated :-) <br /><br />And please if i was too specific about me point that out too, ill try and delete.<br /><br />edit: have been reading (not always understanding lol kmfkewm&#039;s posts - you&#039;re awesome!)<br />
