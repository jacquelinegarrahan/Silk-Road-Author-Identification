				Hello. I am completely new to tor, bitcoins, and silk road. Basically, can someone help me out? I just wanna get to the basics. How can I get bitcoins so I can make a purchase hopefully without having to learn too much more about computers? lol&nbsp; :P Any orientation would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;

				There are several ways to exchange your money for bitcoins. Mt. Gox and Virwox are among the most popular. Just do some Googling around. You won&#039;t have to learn much about computers at all, but you&#039;ll have to do a little bit of math to decide which exchange works best for you.

				I just go through with the Moneypak method, any CVS store has them, just load it up with cash, but not a credit card or any sorts like that, just plain cash. Then just find a vendor who does trades for MP and BTC&#039;s. At times you&#039;ll have the money in your account right away, but when they&#039;re filled with several orders other then yours it may take a day, maybe two, they should have info and percentage rates that they charge on their silk road page. The top 3 vendors I believe are Sugar Mama, BTC Buddy, and BTC Pal. I just choose this method because I&#039;m too lazy to go through other sites and getting wallets and bouncing things around or whatever you need to do haha.

				Oldtoker, your advice is much appreciated! i find myself in a similar boat to obatala.. have been keen to purchase on sr for some time but am finding all the technical stuff quite overwhelming. i&#039;m no idiot but am not particularly computer savvy, and it&#039;s just taken me quite some time to get my head around this whole bitcoin thing. sadly living in aus it&#039;s not as simple as going into walmart and buying a card etc etc, as i&#039;ve seen suggested to many ppl asking. i&#039;ve finally found an aus-friendly site (http://www.spendbitcoins.com/buy/ - hopefully not dodgy??) to purchase them from, but i&#039;m pretty confused as to what happens then?? where do you get both a bitcoin address and this wallet they speak of and where is the wallet kept, and how do i access it? and how do i then get my bitcoins into my sr account? also, once i add a product to my shopping cart (was just experimenting to see the process), where do i get the pin they ask for - (the link &quot;what is my pin?&quot; doesn&#039;t seem to work)? also, whilst reading the forums i keep seeing ppl referring to &quot;pgp&quot; and &quot;gpg&quot; encrypting for messages - do you need to be able to do these things if you&#039;re just purchasing and not asking sellers questions? and if so is there a VERY simple way of doing this without installing 10 different programs and having to link them in labyrinth-like ways?? and lastly - i think! - how does this escrow thing work? this isn&#039;t a standard process in aus like i have heard it is in america - when purchasing property and the such - so i&#039;m not sure how to make my purchase &quot;in escrow&quot;, and i&#039;ve read as a first time buyer i may be asked to &quot;finalize early&quot;, so how do i do that? sorry for the barrage of questions, i&#039;ve truly spent hours trying to find these answers myself on the forums only to end up more confused than when i began! nobody seems to answer in a very simple way without skipping steps and making massive knowledge assumptions... judging by how many other newbies are asking similar questions it seems there is a need for an actual step-by-step quide to sr for dummies!!! many thanks in advance Oldtoker, i plan on becoming a regular and reliable sr user and i want to make sure i do things right from the start as reputation is everything in this world!
