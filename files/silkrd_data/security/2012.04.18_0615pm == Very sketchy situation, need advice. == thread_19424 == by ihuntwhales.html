				Very shady occurrence happened today. Have had multiple successful purchases over the last month or two, but today marked the first hiccup.&nbsp; Around the time the mail was being delivered, the mail delivery person came to my door with a letter in hand asking if it was mine and if it was my address. She said something about money being needed for the postage stamp or something along those lines as I was having trouble understanding her, and she kept trying to confirm that it was for me then she was stating rather blatantly that she was from the post office. I told her that the address and name it was addressed to was mine but I did not recognize the sending address and she then said she would send it to the return address.<br /><br />There are other orders that are on their way at this time and if my mail is being watched this situation could escalate, advise would be greatly appreciated.

				You might want to make sure that your home is squeaky clean for a while, while the dust settles.&nbsp; So if you have a stash, you might want to move it somewhere else.&nbsp; In general, I think it&#039;s a good idea to have no illegal drugs in your home when you are expecting a package.<br /><br />Is this is the U.S.?&nbsp; Sounds like a controlled delivery attempt.&nbsp; Mind telling us what type of quantity you are expecting?&nbsp; We talking a gram or two or something bigger?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel comfortable answering, I understand.

				You did the right thing, so your other orders might be fucked as well. Remember if the cops do come all you should say is your name, &quot;I want a lawyer&quot; and be respectful. Good luck let us&nbsp; know how it goes.

				This order was domestic U.S, a previous package was roughed up slightly but the contents still remained and it was delivered normally through the mail box, and while i should have used better judgement I placed another order (that order being the one that was just walked to my front door). Weight was just under a half O. The postal worker didn&#039;t seem to have any sort of clip board and honestly was just trying in a heavy accent to confirm that it was mine, my mind was racing and I was focusing on my composure and feigned bewilderment so I wish I had payed more attention to her jumbled explanation.&nbsp; There was a number written on the letter and from what I understood she was asking money for a stamp or postage or something? Letters from the same vendor just like this have never been brought to my door and that&#039;s why I believe this was an attempt at a controlled delivery.

				Sounds like your vendor did not include enough postage for the weight of the item.<br /><br />That&#039;s called having mail arrived with &quot;postage due.&quot; Its pretty common. Mail a letter to yourself using a single 1c postage stamp and you&#039;ll see what happens. It&#039;s a good way to annoy people.<br /><br />You did the right thing by letting it go though. Your vendor could probably use a good scolding.<br /><br />Rocker

				Lol, did you just deny your dope delivery over a dime??<br />Even if it were a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;, it&#039;s not illegal to say &quot;Yep, that&#039;s my name and address, here&#039;s the extra dime for postage.I&#039;m really curious what asshole I know that doesn&#039;t know how to put stamps on.&quot; <br />

				Well, needless to say if that&#039;s the case then I feel like a complete and utter retard, but in a situation like that where i was caught completely blindsided I had to follow the advise I knew from these forums. I told the USPS delivery worker to return to sender, is it now out of my hands or is there a window that i can retrieve the letter with an intricate excuse? Yeah, just lost a good bit of money over a solid 45 cents, but that&#039;s how most learning experiences come...expensive.

				Also, I was thinking a reasonable explanation for why the postwoman was trying to make it very clear that she was from the post office is because she&#039;s asking you for money. Probably not a lot of money, but when you&#039;re knocking on someone&#039;s door to collect money you&#039;d probably want to make it very clear that you&#039;re an official postal worker.<br /><br />The package was probably fine, but it is always good procedure to just let it go if stupid shit like this happens. Your vendor owes you a refund / reship most definitely. Most likely refund and an apology.<br /><br />You did the right thing.<br /><br />Rocker

				This is just a fucking postal worker who came to deliver your package by hand because it did not have enough postage because the vendor you used was ignorant.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thanks for the help you all, really incredible community here and sure am glad that this doesn&#039;t seem to be at the significance I believed it was.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now the letter no doubt is in the process of being sent back to the sender, who of course is non existent. Would this letter be held at the office where I could just claim ignorance and state the hard to understand foreign postal worker didn&#039;t explain the situation properly and pay for my letter?

				I hunt you for sure did the right thing. One must prepare for every contingency. If your guts tell you something is amiss then go with it. Remember it is your freedom on the line even if charges don&#039;t stick you still might have to spend days in jail which in itself must be a nightmare. I spend 11 yrs in jail once for&nbsp; a bench warrant for for not showing to court for driving with expired car insurance and it was the longest 11 hrs of my life. I can&#039;t imagine spending 11 weeks. Let the money go if you must and cut your losses. If&nbsp; your friends what to call you paranoid let them. Paranoid keeps people out of trouble. It takes brains to know when to be scared.&nbsp; Always keep you mouth shut and just mumble I want an attorney. Don&#039;t believe anything out of a cops mouth cause they are the biggest lairs in the world and what makes it worst is I use to admire law enforcement as a kid. Loved CHIPS and TJ Hooker haha till I found out how must most (not all) cops are ass holes and truly have no feelings.&nbsp; There are the exceptions of course. I got super fucked up on opana one day last summer and drinking some early times and walked to the church next door and was just sitting their soul searching and someone called the cops on me. This guy was a young cop so I was surprised when he was a super nice guy and&nbsp; my mom and grandmother walked over and begged him not to take me to jail he took my cell phone took a picture of me and asked me if I want to live like this haha then told my mom to take me home and get me help. mind you im in my 30s but this guy was a good dude either that or was too lazy or had a chic waiting on him and didnt want to take the time to drag me downtown.&nbsp; anyways Im feeling it and rambling now&nbsp; but&nbsp; good show on how you handled that. If it happens again I would not accept it&nbsp; even if it&#039;s not illegal to do so. I am a super paranoid sort. When i rread everyone telling you not to worry and it was a common thing (and Im sure it is) the first thing that came to mind is they are all cops trying to get him to lower his guard lol. Anyone else think that when reading this thread?

What happens now is that an unsuspecting and unaware person or business will receive contraband in the mail, which will have your name and delivery address as it&#039;s original destination. Not really a good thing, but you have all the deniability you need.<br /><br />The vendor should probably be notified to not use that return address further. You should probably not order anything to that address for quite some time at least.<br /><br />It may be possible to go to the post office and retrieve your letter, but I don&#039;t give it a very high probability of being there.<br /><br />Sorry that happened, <br /><br />Rocker
