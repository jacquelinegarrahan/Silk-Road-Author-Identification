				im considering getting &quot;FARADAY BAGS&quot;,i would then put my dodgy laptop and dongle in it during transportation to my &quot;hotspots&quot; and for when i keep it at home,do you think this is overkill?? the reason i want to put them in these bags is becuase iam not sure if the pigs are able to &quot;ping&quot; them whilst they are off...if thats the correct word to use...for all i know there could be little devices running on its on little power source inside my dongle/laptop without me knowing ..with todays rate of technology i wouldnt be surprised...is this possible??<br /><br /><br /><br />

				That is in fact overkill. The suspicious behavior you are doing at the coffee shop (i assume that&#039;s what you mean by hotspot, or something similar) is more risk than any negligible benefit that faraday bags can provide. What do you mean by &quot;ping?&quot;

				nah by hotspot i mean sat in a forest.lol...&nbsp; would never go anywhere near shops or the public cause of cams and shite....&nbsp; and when i say ping,i mean like they do with cellphones, heres an explation from some fella on yahoo,my brain doesnt feel like trying to formulate the answer.lol....<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Pinging a cell phone is finding out what cell tower their phone is in. This can be used to locate a person that you know has the cell phone. This is used by law enforcement on a regular basis.<br />Usually the information is provided by the cellular provider and you have to have an account with them. In 911 systems the location is broadcast with the call.<br />If a bad guy is carrying a cell phone the phone is constantly sending signals to the closest cell tower, even if the phone isn&#039;t in use. The location of the cell tower will tell you that the person is within a certain range. When the person moves they can be tracked by which cell towers the signal is bouncing to&quot;&quot;&quot;<br /><br /><br />but i mean it could be some other piece of technology inside the laptop or dongle that i dont know about,so if i put it in a farday bag,at least i will know 100% that NO signals are coming in and out...

				Perhaps removing the battery would suffice, as I understand is the case with cellphones.&nbsp; That way there wouldn&#039;t be anything with power to return a &quot;ping&quot;.

				Don&#039;t listen to these guys they all work for the FBI.<br />Truth is that your computer always broadcasts your exact location, what you&#039;re wearing, and how many illegal things you&#039;ve done in your entire life.<br />It doesn&#039;t matter if it has a battery or not, they work through telekinesis where they have overlord FBI agents capable of powering on any machine in the world with their minds.<br />They also know what you&#039;re thinking and can track you down anywhere.<br />The only way out is to burn delete system 32, get drunk on beer you brew yourself and&nbsp; then tinfoil helmets.<br /><br /><br />and don&#039;t worry the aliens will be here soon so even if you go to jail they&#039;ll have you out fighting the intergalactic war in a matter of weeks.

				As long as the bags don&#039;t have any holes in them they will block all signals.&nbsp; But always remember to remove the batteries.
