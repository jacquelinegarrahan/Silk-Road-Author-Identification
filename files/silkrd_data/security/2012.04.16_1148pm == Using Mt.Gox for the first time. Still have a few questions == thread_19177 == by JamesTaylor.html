				Hello everyone! I recently got scammed by a Btc exchange vendor on here and have decided to buy the coins. Myself. I have been doing some research on here and still have a few questions.&nbsp; Sorry guys if this has already been mentioned. I looked all over the forums and im still a tab bit confused. SO please be nice!<br /><br /><br />While not using tor I log onto Mtgox. To add funds I would use &quot;cash deposit via bitinstant&quot;&nbsp; Now once I make the deposit Do I need to go onto bitinstant?? This is the part that I am confused about..... Or once I make the deposit the money will be added to my mt gox account????&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything else I pretty much know what to do<br />Im going to send the coins to a wallet or btcfog and than to SR. Just for a little extra security<br /><br /><br />Thanks in adavance guys!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keeponsmiling<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />P.S 5 more days til 4/20! -_-

				I suggest using Dwolla to make your deposits. You can link Dwolla right to your bank account, make deposits that take 3-5 business days, and there&#039;s only a 25 cent fee, which you really can&#039;t be beat. From there, you send the money in your Dwolla account to Mt. Gox through bitinstant, and then you&#039;re free to purchase your bitcoins. It&#039;s really the easiest way in my opinion. But get the process starting now, because before you can even use Dwolla, you need to validate your bank account there, and that takes about a week as it is. Good luck!

				<br />My BitInstant transactions have always been smooth.<br />And I have always used the cash deposit option.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it worked for me...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Entered all of my info into BitInstant (Mt.Gox Account#, email address, total sending).&nbsp; BitInstant then produced a page to print out that has all of the bank deposit info.<br />2.&nbsp; I took this to one of their sponsored banks and asked to make an out-of-state deposit.<br />3.&nbsp; The teller filled in all of the info from the BitInstant print-out and I handed over the cash.&nbsp; Never once was I asked for ID, nor was my name ever recorded.<br />4.&nbsp; In a fairly short amount of time, maybe 30 mins or so, I got an email from BitInstant saying that the deposit was successful.&nbsp; This is where BitInstant gave me a coupon code to enter into Mt.Gox.<br />5.&nbsp; Entered the coupon code into Mt.Gox, got my bitcoins in Mt.Gox.<br />6.&nbsp; Transferred from Mt.Gox to an instawallet, then to BitCoinFog, then to SR.<br /><br />Hope this helps!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				With all this talk about dwolla taking 30 days to verify a account im a little confused. If I use bitinstant to mt gox this new policy dose not apply right? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks

				<br />I don&#039;t think Dwolla is involved if doing a BitInstant (cash bank deposit) to Mt.Gox.<br />I didn&#039;t have to wait 30 days for any BitInstant -&gt; Mt.Gox transaction.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an update on the process.<br /><br />Today, I made another cash deposit and instead of BitInstant emailing me a coupon code to redeem on Mt.Gox, they automatically transferred my funds into Mt.Gox.<br />So, one less step to complete.<br />

				Has anyone managed to login to mtgox.com while using TOR? When I try this I get &quot;We have received too many failed requests from your IP address. Consiquently, your IP address has been blocked for 24 hours. Please try again after this time tomorrow.&quot;<br /><br />My understanding is that Mt Gox has blacklisted TOR IP addresses. Is there a safe and anonymous way around this (VPN maybe) or do most people just not care about anonymity when using mtgox.com?

Now when transferring them to SR is where you should be more cautious. Ppl say they directly deposit the coins from Mtgox ----&gt; SR... Im a little hesitant to do that.&nbsp; You should be fine as long as your not moving big amounts. But your better off sending them to a wallet and/or bitcoinfog.
