				I think there are a few exploits that can open up your identity to an attacker/spy.<br />Mike Tigas is pretty open about some of the potential issues of Onion Browser.<br />From website--&gt;<br /><br />Bugs, Caveats, Side Notes<br /><br />See the Github project for a current list of known issues.<br /><br />Using Onion Browser does not inherently guarantee security or privacy. It simply provides a set of features that may enhance privacy and anonymity while browsing the web. For more information: The Tor Project maintains a small section about staying anonymous over Tor, as do several threads on Reddit and other messageboard sites.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Disclaimer: Onion Browser only tunnels traffic within the Onion Browser app. You are still using a smartphone, and in extremely sensitive circumstances you should be aware that iOS or your cellular provider may continue to leak non-Onion Browser traffic and other information.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Major iOS SDK Limitation: Websites using HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tags will leak &lt;video&gt;-related DNS queries and data transfer outside of Tor. This includes YouTube, Vimeo, and any website using iOS-compatible HTML5 video. This is a behavior of the embedded QuickTime player and there is currently no known workaround. (h/t to josyw.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; iOS SDK Limitation: Javascript cannot be disabled in the `UIWebView`, so script-based detection may identify your device even if User-Agent Spoofing is enabled.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; iOS SDK Limitation: Related to above, the HTML5 Geolocation API cannot be disabled. The browser will ask you for permission to access your location if a website asks for it via the HTML5 Geolocation API. If you allow this, then said website will (obviously) know your actual current location.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Common Sense: If you log into websites in Onion Browser that you normally log into outside of the Tor network, they will a) still know who you are, and b) know that you use Tor. In certain circumstances (i.e. political dissent in repressive nations), this may be incriminating information in itself.<br />

				So would you say that using the app strictly for sr and its forums is enough to protect your identity?&nbsp; The problem seems to be that scripts cannot be disabled, but I don&#039;t believe sr runs scripts that will compromise your identity.&nbsp; So as a Silk Road only app, I believe it is a viable option.

				I wouldn&#039;t trust IOS with anything which could be considered illegal or objectable by law enforcement. For all we know they could have a spying suite tucked away inside that code. Sell your iphone and buy an android, install a custom ROM and leave all google oriented apps off that shit.<br /><br />The only security benefit I can see to using The Onion Browser is that so little people use it that a doubt an exploit would target it.
