				High Everyone?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;New Vendors should know that you do not need to go in to post office to send priority or first class mail envelopes.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;For example: You can buy $100.00 worth of $1.00 stamps and for the priority mail packages, attach six&nbsp; $1.00 stamps or five&nbsp; $1.00 and .one 15cent stamp) to the envelope (only works with envelopes that can fit through the mail slot inside post office near scale)&nbsp; For first class, the postage is $1.95 but you have to throw the envelope on the scale and make sure its less than 13 ounces.&nbsp; If it&#039;s over 13 ounces, but can still fit through the skot, use the scale to weigh and calculate the new price and attach additional postage., and then slide envelope through mail slot without going inside.&nbsp; All can be done anonymously.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Hope this helps!<br /><br />Peace 8) <br />Libby

				anchientlib, I think that more than a couple of ounces it will be more than $1.95 for first class. Also, the 13 ounce rule means you can&#039;t put it in a mail slot if it weighs more than that. I think you run the risk that they will stop it and return the package to sender and if you use a fake address (and name I&#039;m sure) that means you will never get the package back and neither will the recipient.<br /><br />The trouble is, don&#039;t they at the post office then feel obliged (if it is proved that the return address is fake) to open the package to see what gives? Won&#039;t that expose the recipient to unneeded risk?<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				So domestic priority mail flat rate is 5.xx . <br /><br />If I put together a priority mail envelope together with the allowed weight, put an address label on it, I can just put 5.xx worth of stamps on the top right and drop it off in a blue box? And it&#039;ll get there? They don&#039;t have to run it through their machine in the inside?<br /><br />-LIGHTFLOWER

				Hey, <br />Dwarf, you&#039;re right, hell I didn&#039;t even kbnow that, but I got some yesterday. very cool.&nbsp; Also, yes I was wrong before. If the domestic envelope doesnt fit or is more than 13 ounces, you have to go inside and mail it, but if you are paying a flat rate on priority, it&#039;s just got to fit thru the slot. ty everyone.<br /><br />Libby<br />
