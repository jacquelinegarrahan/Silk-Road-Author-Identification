				I live in a rural area, and receive my mail at the Post Office.<br /><br />When I receive a package too big for my box, they leave a key instead, so I can retrieve it from some lockers.&nbsp; If the lockers are full, or I need to sign for it, they leave a card and I have to get to the post office before they close and deal with a real living person.<br /><br />Because their hours of operation have always been slim, and I believe because of the announced cut-backs of USPS in general, they plan to further reduce these hours, they have recently started a service which allows you to &quot;pre-sign&quot; for such deliveries. <br /><br />You fill out some form, and they&#039;ll leave the key in my PO Box, etc.<br /><br />Now, I like that as I often get there hours after they close.&nbsp; No one around, just me and mail joy etc. etc.<br />But what bothers me is what if this is a &#039;controlled delivery&#039;?&nbsp; Does this just make it easier for them, or do you think that they need to see you actually sign for the package at time of delivery?<br /><br />I think I spelled out the dilemma coherently lol

				I think with controlled delivery you don&#039;t have to sign, just accept and open the package and have the drugs in your posession when they come flying through the door. Again the mark return to sender and leave it alone unopened inside your place for a day or so seems to work. <br /><br />If you did the pre-sign thing, otherwise known as &quot;OK to safedrop&quot; you may have some extra plausable deniability. Automatically signed for so unless you&#039;re caught with it open maybe possible to weasel out of any charges. ?
