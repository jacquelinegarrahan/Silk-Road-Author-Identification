				I have been using this service to fund my btc needs and i am getting to the point where i am going to start ordering qwaps or more every week. You can deposit 500$ a day i use a fake last name and address but do they notice this or will the people at CVS be suspicous or do anything abou me depositing thousands of dollars and paying with zip zap?

				Are you using the same place each time or changing it up?&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to the same place each time they&#039;re bound to pay more attention.&nbsp; If you have the option, also try different types of places.&nbsp; <br /><br />Around my area at least, they don&#039;t get a lot of these transfers to the point where I have to tell the cashier how to punch it in.&nbsp; If I&#039;m coming in with large $$ amounts every few days or even more than once a week they&#039;ll start wondering.&nbsp; The managers also talk to each other and nearby stores, and topics of unusual trends tend to come up (I used to work at CVS).

				i just use 4 different CVS&#039;s in 2 different towns. i&#039;ve lived in both towns and pretty much know the employees at said places. when i was out of town one month i used another CVS and that&#039;s the only time i was asked for identification, to which i responded : &quot;eh, i just got out of jail and dont have my ID anymore and they went ahead and put it through&nbsp; :)<br /><br />not to sure if this helps but it worked for me&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				If you&#039;re working with dollar amounts this high, I feel like using a service that allows you to make a cash deposit at a bank would be much more anonymous. I might be wrong though, someone correct me if I am, but this is jjust what I would assume...

				Seems to me that CVS has been making it more difficult to use Moneygram without ID. It used to work all the time, but now I hear reports that it takes repeated tries at different locations or different cashiers. Wal-Mart doesn&#039;t seem to have this problem, so that would be the place to go if there&#039;s one nearby.

				So there is this vendor called &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; <br />She does this service on sr where you buy a moneypak and give her the card # and the amount of $ on it she then transfers it and gives you bitcoins for it.<br />You can get moneypak at cvs thats where i got mine, and its like buying a gamestop giftcard basically except u can put up to 500$ on it and you dont give any info
