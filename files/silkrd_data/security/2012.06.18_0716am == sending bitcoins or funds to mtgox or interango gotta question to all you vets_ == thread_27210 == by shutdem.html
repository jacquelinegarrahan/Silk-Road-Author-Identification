				So, say know that bitcoins are high prices and starting to fall! Now, i my self dont have much but enough i lose a few $&#039;s when it drops 10 cents here and there. This adds up!&nbsp; Now, if i send my bitcoins to mtgox or intersango.&nbsp; Say i have $100 will that be $100 if the rate drops? or will it drop as well? would i have to sell them at the rate now to have the cash rate now? i am sure the VETS HERE KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND CAN HELP.<br />shit maybe even some jr&#039;s or newbies have had this issue! i have researched but no one says about this topic i have seen! and i put 2 days into reading and before the rate drops to much id like to know.lol<br />THANKS IN ADVANCE!

				If you buy BTC at a certain rate, you just bought them at that rate... You won&#039;t get more or less BTC if the price changes. Not even when you keep them in an exchange. Please remember that BTC prices can also go up, which also adds up. This is different on SR where most orders are hedged, look it up.<br /><br />Just make sure there&#039;s as least a much time between buying and paying with your BTC. This will keep your risks down.

				ok my question. is tho lets say i have $100 for a round number in bitcoins in my sr account. now, prices age goin down! they have been starting too.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So if i send them to either place will it remain $100 or it will go to whatever the coin value right? Sp. if i want to keep the $100 as a full $100 then just sending to mtgox or intersango wont help. I would have to sell them on there? and get the cash for the highest rate? then come time when i want to order,&nbsp; i will have the cash? and i can trade for coins at that current rate?&nbsp; is that right?<br />so recap.1 if i sent to mtgox or intersango bitcoins worth $100, they will depreciate? i wont stay at $100?<br /><br />2 so i would have to sell the coins at the current rate to keep the money without losing when price drops? and buy again when i need them?<br /><br />thank you to all sr emembers. vets jr members<br />any1 who can answer thsi for me and has experiance with it!<br />thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />sincerely<br />Dan and again thank you anyone who answer in advance! thank you as well jochem for what you did answer but i dont think you got my entire ?
