				I have been trying to figure out how to buy as many BTC as i need (30-40 every 2/3 weeks). I got myself verified with CaVirtex but i cannot justify that amount seeing as my income just wouldn&#039;t cover that on top of living costs etc. Obviously, if i was depositing 5-10k/month but only making lets say, 2, that would flag me. But what if i had 7-8 verified accounts(these peoples incomes are all very small, 800-1000/month) and deposited 500-600/month on each account. Would it still get flagged even though it is such a small amount?<br /><br />I realize LocalBitcoins is quite common now, but there is nobody in my area that isn&#039;t 15%+ above mt gox. I have heard people say that you can deposit cash into a bank to buy on LocalBitcoins but can&#039;t figure that out. any ideas?

				Some people have had good success buying traveler&#039;s cheques anonymously. I use LBC and do face to face cash and carry. There&#039;s always someone who&#039;s willing to unload coins at or very close to market.

				Traveller&#039;s cheques? What would those do for me?<br /><br />LBC seems to work very well for people but there is a total of 4 sellers in my city, and are selling up to 2 coins....i need about 25/week.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to recirculate vendor&#039;s coins to the buyers. this would eliminate the task of safely getting money in/out.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s lot&#039;s of people who post on bitcointalk.org in currency exchange that sell bitcoins in Canada for mailed cash. Same with #bitcoin-cad
