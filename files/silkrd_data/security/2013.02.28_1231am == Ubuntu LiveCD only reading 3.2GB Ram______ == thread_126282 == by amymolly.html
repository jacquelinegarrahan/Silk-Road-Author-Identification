				Anyone else have this problem? I downloaded the 12.10 64bit version and have tried from multiple computers and 3.2gb is the most memory the O/S is showing. Ive tried majority of the solutions I could find on the clearnet to no avail&nbsp; :-[. I then realized I had access to a group of individuals more enlightened in this subject than those on the clearnet. HELP!!!!! Just need enough space for blockchain to sync so I can create a new wallet.

				1. How much RAM do you actually have?<br /><br />2. Do you have a graphics card, and how much RAM does that have?<br /><br />3. Are you absolutely sure it is the 64 bit version? What is the name of the iso file?<br />

				You can&#039;t sync the blockchain with 3.2gb of ram? I would think it would work.. not fast, but it should work.. syncing the blockchain takes a while on most machines anyway. What about making a wallet on blockchain.info?

				I actually had this same problem recently trying to set up a wallet for my buddy. Everything worked fine on my setup but his was only reading 3.1gb on his Ubuntu liveUsb. The 3.1gb surprisingly wasnt enough to load the blockchain. His Usb was 16gb and his computer had 6gb ram, still was only reading 3.1gb(I even tried on a couple of computers). We still havent figured out the problem, so if anyone could help id appreciate it as well!

				Solution: use Electrum.<br /><br />No blockchain.

				The reason you guys are having speed issues is likely not because of your ram (ubuntu only shows available ram btw). If you are running the 64bit install then the ram issue should be moot.. The blockchain actually bottlenecks at your hdd.. An SSD can sync the blockchain in about 3-6 hours. A decent SATA platter drive can do it in a 12-18 hours. A USB 2.0 external drive may take several days, a USB stick may take over a week, possibly two. Sorry I didnt mention this yesterday, I was stoned and spaced that the bottleneck issue might need brought up&nbsp; ::)<br />In a nutshell, eddie the gun has the easiest solution..<br />Also keep in mind that a live usb if using a regular client will lose the blockchain upon every reboot. you can keep a copy of the blockchain somewhere i suppose.. but electrum is easy peasy. I use a selfish client myself on my android devices.
