				Intersango really sucks at the moment, I wouldn&#039;t recommend them! Have you tried mt.Gox (not that scam mt.Gix) or there is a guy round here who does cash in the mail for Bitcoins. He&#039;s called Vlad1m1r, I haven&#039;t used his service but it sounds like a good way to remain anonymous when buying your coins.<br /><br />What are the problems you are having specifically? Then maybe, we&#039;ll have a better idea how to help. :)

				Well it seems I cant just use bank transfer or visa card to buy, from what I have read on the info pages I have to use some third party to transact cash to bitcoins ? I am new to bitcoins so I have not done much research into it yet but it seems tricky .

				You can make cash deposits at the bank (I think for mtGox it&#039;s Barclays?). But these are by no means totally anonymous.<br />I&#039;m sorry I can&#039;t really help you more. Hopefully someone may chime in with some better advice. :)

				I use MtGox by depositing cash via the self service slot at Barclays, fairly anonymous as anyone can drop envelopes into the box, no need to speak to anyone..... Balance credited within 48hrs....

				After their bank account got released after being investigated must have used them 5 or so times, deposits only. Always been first class, through within a couple of hours, no problems whatsoever. New to this myself so can&#039;t speak beyond last couple months but apart from that investigation (and let&#039;s be fair, can hardly blame them for that, that must have done terrible damage to their business). they have been completely professional. Not to say may all change tomorrow.<br /><br />In fact I see their UK account is going to close at end of month so that&#039;s going to be another nightmare setting up something else. These guys are trying thier best as far as I can see to provide a professional service, as I say only two months been here,&nbsp; but I can&#039;t help but feel sorry for them. Who else is out their trying? Money through the post? Come on, bitcoins are meant to be a serious alternative to fiat currency, we can do better than that.<br /><br />Used mt.gox when Intersango was down and worked flawlessly their too, deposited with correct reference, email arrived around 24-36 hours later, money was their.<br /><br />Bitcoin really does need to sort out some sort of central clearing house but then that is the start of the road (admittedly 300 or so years ago) that got us in this situation so don&#039;t know what the answer is.&nbsp; With anonymity comes liberty but with liberty comes those who will take advantage of the freedom and use to their own advantage, more&#039;s the pity.<br /><br />Think I&#039;ll be going mt.gox route. My rule always with this, whether buying bitcoins or using them to buy goods is always deal with what won&#039;t bother me if I lose it. I expect at some point I&#039;ll lose it, so when then point comes don&#039;t complain.&nbsp;

				After my singing the praises of INtersango I made a deposit before end of month and disapppear. Like my rule in all these things, never more than I&#039;d be upset at losing, in this case a little under Â£300. Seems like the payment passed but is now &#039;pending_review&#039; and has been for two days; I&#039;ve made various successful payments to them from same account, same all, etc over the last month all like clockwork, now this. There excuse is that the automated system rejected it because it may be similar to some other payment (I know, makes no sense to me either) and that it has to be mnanually approved by an admin who is only available every other day.<br /><br />Coming up to third day now, still &#039;under_review&#039;. KInda written that money off. If it comes through, great, if not, well, not the first won&#039;t be last time I&#039;ve lost money in this game, won&#039;t put me up nor down. My completely unfounded and probably 100% wrong theory (I don&#039;t want to slander people as what they say may actually be 100% true and I&#039;d hate do them an injustice) is that don&#039;t have the funds cover withdrawals before bank clses at end of month (all rushing to take money out) so they&#039;re holding on to deposits.<br /><br />As I say, every chance I&#039;m wrong as up to this point they have been flawless with me, just pisses you off to have Â£300 tied up&nbsp; that I now can&#039;t either cancel or buy BTC with, just wait at their whim.<br /><br />Ordered similar amount off mtgox today, will be interesting see who comes in first.<br /><br />EDIT: Inrersango came through so I guess rhat makes me an idiot who is too quick to jump to wrong conclusions. Can&#039;t take back my words but I would like to apologies for doubting them and admit I typed before thinking (which I should do less of). Sorry again.

				I placed an order with intersango before the bank holiday and started worrying when it hadn&#039;t appeared after five days. The money came through on the sixth day, and it would have been nicer to happen faster but I don&#039;t think it was really their fault because of the bank holiday and MetroBank. They were helpful in their support section too. <br /><br />I reckon they&#039;re honest and reliable, but at the moment they need to sort out some issues with their bank. Maybe it is best to wait until they have cleared all that up before using them? At least if you want your BTC fast.

				I use Mt Gox to transfer money and worked a treat. Would use again without hesitation. I have never been stung (touch wood) so will use them again. All I would say is don&#039;t expect it to be instant, it does take a few days but essentially time it right (say when you are halfway thru your stash) then do a bank transfer , wait a few days then transfer to SR , then order off SR ... wait for delivery ... all in all adds up , but get the timing right , your new package would turn up when you at the end of stash. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been looking into couple solutions. It&#039;s a bit convulted though. Get verified with exchangezone so can use paypal, but PP ban BTC so need to set up Liberty Reserve account, buy them with Paypal from exchangezone, then send them to \mtgox where (I believe, as I say still looking into it) they get converted instantly to BTC. Need to check rates too, don&#039;t want to lose like 5% on each transaction but there&#039;s&nbsp; a few sites allow PP purchase of LR if verify. If paranoid could go through yet another step with blockchains mixing service. Still with few hours for each BTC transfer never going to be as good as a proper solution, which is bound to come unless blocked cause of association with here.<br /><br />Shandyson I completely agree with you but it&#039;s if something unusual pops it&#039;s head up, and I don&#039;t have the will power hold a reserve.
