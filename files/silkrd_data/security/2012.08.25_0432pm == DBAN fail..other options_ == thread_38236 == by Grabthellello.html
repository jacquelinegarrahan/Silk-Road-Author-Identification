				I have spent the last 6 hours (yes 6 hours straight) trying to use DBAN to wipe my hard drive but it seems there is a glitch in the program that requires you to deactivate the card reader either through BIOS or by physically disconnecting it from the mother board for it to work properly. Otherwise you get an error saying something to the effect of &quot;DBAN has completed with a non-fatal error. This is most likely caused by a bad disk.&quot; According to what I&#039;ve read, it seems like DBAN doesn&#039;t recognize the card reader and then throws a shit fit. Unfortunately my BIOS does not have the option to disable it and I&#039;m using a laptop so physically disconnecting it is a pain in the ass (I tried, but half way through disassembling it I started to get a bad feeling about pulling my shit apart lol).<br /><br />Attempted unsuccessful work arounds:<br />-I tried uninstalling the card reader from device manager, then rebooting into DBAN.<br />-Tried putting an SD card in the card reader to give DBAN something to &quot;see&quot;<br />-Used 3 different version of DBAN (2.2.6, 2.0.0, and 1.0.7)<br />-Attempted booting by disk and USB drive<br /><br />I also tried using a wipe program called MHDD, but it might as well been in Greek it was so confusing and ambiguous. Supposedly there&#039;s another good program called HDDerase but it looks like the site that hosts it is down or something. After 6 hours I&#039;m ready to say F it and throw the damn thing out the window.<br /><br />TL;DR...Does anyone know a way around the &quot;non-fatal error&quot; in DBAN or another program that will get the job done?<br />

				Thanks for the info. That first link was the one that I was trying to go to but the server must have been down or something that day because it wouldn&#039;t load at all. I ended up finding a free trial of a paid software called BCwipe. After 3 passes of 0&#039;s it seemed to do the trick.
