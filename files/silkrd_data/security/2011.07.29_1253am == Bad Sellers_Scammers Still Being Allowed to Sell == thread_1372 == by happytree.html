				First, let me apologize if this is topic thread is posted elsewhere and mod, please feel free to move it,&nbsp; if this isn&#039;t the appropriate place. However, I have noticed a LOT lately that there are repeated cases of sellers starting out (5 or so+) with positive transactions and feedback, and the suddenly feedback going consistently to &quot;1 out of 5, never received, thankfully SR refunded my money, never heard from seller&quot;, etc. etc. <br /><br />While I realize it is the responsibility of a buyer to be a bit more intelligent than your average bear, and READ the recent reviews of other buyers in order to determine as to whether he/she wants to assume the risk of the same kind of experience, I would like to think that SR monitors the shitty sellers from the ones with consistent, high feedback (I&#039;m not talking about people leaving dick comments about quality), but the ones that are OBVIOUSLY consistently ripping people off. I don&#039;t think it takes a genius to determine which sellers are, versus aren&#039;t scamming.<br /><br />Do new people repeatedly have to be ripped off and bitch and moan about it in the forums (and if so, what constitutes a &quot;fair&quot; number of new people being ripped-off) for SR to finally remove these dirty sellers?<br /><br />Just some food for thought and/or improvement here....I myself am no high-roller in life. And therefore, even one time I get scammed&nbsp; - just the hassle of it will probably give me enough reason to not buy here again. Not that anyone would care. But this place is sacred to me, and I would like to keep it as safe and protected for all as well, as possible.<br /><br />Happy Happy Tree Tree

				Barry has (last I checked) almost 100% positive feedback.<br />That doesn&#039;t always work.<br /><br />And this might be an unpopular opinion, but Having newbies get ripped off might not be the worst thing.&nbsp; <br />Ideally it shouldn&#039;t happen, but it might serve to keep people who are lax about security off the site.<br /><br />If a buyer has lax security and gets busted, He&#039;ll probably admit to where he got the stuff and that just draws more attention our way... <br /><br />It&#039;s not great, and not Ideal, but it keeps people on their toes.&nbsp; Like it or not, what happens here is highly illegal.

				Newbies tend to be even more impatient than the rest of us.&nbsp; They&#039;ve never gotten drugs off the internet and they really want to see it happen: that magic moment when they open the envelope/box and a day or two of feelin&#039; groovy falls out.&nbsp; It&#039;s a magical experience and every newbie wants to have his &quot;first&quot;.<br /><br />But in the old days when we didn&#039;t have great stuff like escrow and a resolution center, the ONLY way a newbie could afford to buy online was if they didn&#039;t get ripped off constantly.&nbsp; And that meant going to the forum, reading ALL the posts back about 6 months and forming their own, very clear, mental image of the people involved on the site.&nbsp; Once they did that they were nearly as caught up as the people who had been around for a long while.&nbsp; While there&#039;s no substitute for experience, there is a very straightforward way to capitalize on *other* people&#039;s experiences and that&#039;s to read the board, sober, until you get the picture.<br /><br />That said, I agree with Ms Tree and I don&#039;t understand why SR is letting BS keep on keepin&#039; on.&nbsp; But I have to believe *something* is up because it is totally out of character for SR to see and hear all of our complaints and then do nothing about it.&nbsp; I have a feeling we&#039;re only going to hear about this one &quot;after it&#039;s over.&quot;&nbsp; ;)
