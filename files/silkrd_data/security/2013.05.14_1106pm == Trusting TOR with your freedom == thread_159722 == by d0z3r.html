				I was just curious about how many vendors trust TOR enough to use it from home. I know everyone will be guessing but what percentage of vendors do you think do this?&nbsp; It seems like it would be quite a hassle to run to the&nbsp; nearest hotspot to check orders and what not. What are your guys thoughts on this topic?

				its never safe to sell or purchase illegal drugs<br />there is always a risk of getting caught<br />to be a vendor on SR isnt only selling and packing drugs safe i<br />the security is number one <br />i think a lot of vendors can say this also<br />many hours packing with gloves in clean rooms<br />establishing a secure conection for internet etc<br />only using tor isnt good enough for a vendor<br />much customers do not appreciate the time a vendor needs to put in SR to keep<br />him/her self safe and the customer<br />but that is what a vendor chooses for<br />its a risk..<br /><br />regards,mercury31

				So here&#039;s the real problem... they don&#039;t exactly teach cryptography, data communications, or networking fundamentals in police academy.&nbsp; It takes somebody a wee bit more knowledgeable than your average flat foot to even know how the fuck Tor works let alone how to dismantle the protection it provides.<br /><br />Can they do it?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It can be done, and everyone knows how.&nbsp; Lots of ways have been published and some have been shown effective in laboratory settings.&nbsp; That&#039;s different than the real thing though: we aren&#039;t a controlled environment with manageable traffic, we&#039;re a lot bigger than that.<br /><br />But they can do it; so what&#039;s stopping them?&nbsp; Nobody cares enough to spend the money and burn the man hours on it.&nbsp; I mean I don&#039;t regularly take tea with the head of the DEA or anything, but that&#039;s the only logical conclusion in my opinion.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to get caught, it&#039;s almost certainly going to be from fucking up and getting arrested the old fashioned way.&nbsp; That&#039;s true today, mind you: it may or may not be true a year from now.&nbsp; Our safety depends pretty heavily on them not having any reason to waste the amount of resources it would take to bring SR -- and all of us addicts and dealers just minding our own damn business -- down.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a stupid waste of resources when SR is such a small portion of the national drug trade.&nbsp; But if it appears to be a large portion because it&#039;s in the news constantly, well... then they may change their minds and invest the time and money; that&#039;s why I say it&#039;s true today but maybe not a year from now.&nbsp; Who knows.<br /><br />Bottom line: today you&#039;re safe.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t talk to cops and don&#039;t be naive about your drops and you&#039;re good :)

				I trust it enough to make nearly thousands of posts on these silly forums blatantly admitting that I willfully and repeatedly break the law to feed my addiction; I also order very nearly all of my drugs through it while trusting the encryption of in-Tor-network communications; I also transmit my real name and address via RSA encryption (PGP) and trust that too (well really I should say a real name tied to the address).<br /><br />I&#039;ll have over 40 orders by week&#039;s end.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t lost a single one, either.&nbsp; If I were a vendor I&#039;d do all my business from home, yes.&nbsp; Does that answer your question about trusting Tor?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Frankly what worries me quite a bit more is the server getting pwned or some sneaky federal agency posing as a vendor or some silly thing like that.&nbsp; Tor I have no concerns with -- none based in reality, anyway.

They find a vendor who is selling a range of drug amounts, like 1 gram up to an ounce of cocaine. They check the reviews to make sure the vendor is getting sales and actually pushing that product. This would be someone with many ounces of cocaine. Then they buy 1 gram off the vendor. Only costs $150 and they know the vendor&#039;s city.<br /><br />They hand the ISP a list of Tor entry guards and known bridges, and request the subscriber info of everyone who connects to those IP addresses, say 5 days out of the next 7 days. In a week they are down to a list of 10 - 200 people. They start watching those subscribers and messaging the vendor, looking at the response times, so it&#039;s basically a low grade correlation attack, similar to what they did to this guy:<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/stakeout-how-the-fbi-tracked-and-busted-a-chicago-anon/<br /><br />They watched his local network with a tap and trace device installed in his computer and correlated it to his IRC activity (which he accessed over Tor).<br /><br />What percentage of those daily users will be online at the specific hour when a message is received from the vendor? 10%, 20%, 50%? Even in the &quot;worst&quot; case scenario for LE, they can exclude half the people on their list every time they receive a message. How many halvings does it take to get down to one person that they can start investigating IRL?<br /><br />Even if they start with a list of 200 people, surprisingly it takes only 9 halvings, which is 9 messages. Unfortunately for them, there is a small percentage of users who stay online all the time (like on IRC), so those people will never be excluded from the list. LE would have to investigate all of them.<br /><br /><br />I should note that it&#039;s easy to defend against this attack. Use a VPN or rent a VPS and set up a private bridge.<br /><br /><br />So why hasn&#039;t this happened yet? Surely the computer experts that they employ have thought of it. <br /><br />I think SS is right, LE either doesn&#039;t care, or it&#039;s too inefficient. Maybe the the last leg isn&#039;t worth it. ie, they reduce 200 users to 20 or 30 who are always online, but investigating all of them is too much work to bust someone pushing the amounts of drugs that SR vendors push.<br /><br />And if anything I said is remotely true, then you can help vendors by using Tor all the time. ;)<br /><br />

Astors view was basically what I came to. Basically multiple layers of triangulation and correlation, narrowing the net each time.<br /><br />A range booster/cantenna/repeaters etc and some physical access controls will give you a very good safety net if you are paranoid. These even work with cell signals if you want to bounce your 3g connection off a different cell tower and can do the required maths and practical butchery involved.<br /><br />Learn how all the technologies work, even basically, and think about how future technologies will be used. This is a war by people on people and as people, we must know how to defend ourselves. Semantic search, location awareness, geo-spatial mapping and mining blah blah blah.<br /><br />But that responsibility is on the head of individual alone.

				I&#039;ve used TOR since 2004 with no problems.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how many more people use it than in 2004.&nbsp; I know I used to have to change my identities a lot for years just to get decent speeds.&nbsp; It is not like that anymore.&nbsp; So many people use TOR that I really can&#039;t see it being a problem.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a SR vendor but that is just how I feel about it.
