				So I just joined this week, learned tor,pgp etc all that good stuff for security. I&#039;ve made about 4 orders from different vendors and my friend who introduced me to this site started yelling at me lol. Should I really be that paranoid that im recieving a few letters/packages possibly. I know it could possibly draw attention to me but I was safe picking different vendors for different products. I&#039;m just wondering did I screw up or is he ultra paranoid that somehow its going to link back to him when we only talked about this in encrypted messages. And even if I recieve these packages with no problem should I put Return to Sender on all of them and hold on to them before opening just in case and say that someone is out to get me or just say absolutely nothing other than IDK who sent this stuff.<br /><br />Anyways Ridicule away hopefully I didnt get myself screwed but I feel fairly safe in my gut. Man I wish I was Leroy Jethro Gibbs, then I would really know... .rofl<br /><br />-thanks

				If they are all reputable vendors you should be fine. The only increased danger is that if you do get caught, LE will be able to bust you for multiple packages instead of just one. The whole return-to-sender trick is useless in my opinion.

				For basic starters do you regularly receive national / international mail? If all you get are utility bills and adverts then suddenly there are 10 big packages arriving in a day (exaggerating) it probably will raise an eyebrow.<br /><br />Also consider getting multiple locations. Some use dead drops, some think PO boxes are good although others say no. There are a few threads on those. Whatever method you choose, it is advisable to not store your stuff at receiving location. <br /><br />Say they performed a control delivery on you. They&#039;ve been letting packets get through for weeks. Postman drops off package or asks you to sign for it. You open the door and SWAT team pops out and arrest you. If you have nothing else there, then they have no way of proving whatever contraband in that particular package is yours. Your lawyer can argue that you&#039;ve been setup, that you have no illegal stuff at home since you are a law-abiding upstanding citizen. In this example they will have to follow you all day for weeks and check all those locations for caches. Plus you could have handed it off to someone else. And clean up after yourself. Trace amounts of substance could be argued to be merely contamination since paper money in circulation is cross contaminated frequently.<br /><br />From what I gather (not having the finances to test it myself) big shipments get broken down into smaller packets to get past security more easily.<br /><br />Lastly, WHY THE FUCKING FUCK DID YOUR FRIEND KNOW YOU ORDERED FOUR PACKAGES? If he gets busted and sings like a canary in exchange for less time (see prisoner&#039;s dilemma), (cops get a warrant?) they&#039;re going to try get the biggest bust per resource (if they don&#039;t have the resources to SWAT all his associates). 4 packages a week is a more tempting target over one they don&#039;t know the rate / quantity of. You might as well put A MOTHERFUCKING BIG RED NEON SIGN saying PROMOTION to cops / DA or whoever wants a piece of your flesh. The strict laws being what they are means they can accuse your quantity (assuming they have it in evidence) indicating distribution, even though it may only be for personal use.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s how I would do it. Think from their perspective. Develop countermeasures accordingly. Try from their shoes again. Repeat until you cannot. Review it 1 week later. See if you spot mistakes and hope they didn&#039;t spot it. Modify &amp; deploy. Repeat.

				Hey OP, I dont actually see what it is here, that your friend had something to say to you about?<br /><br />Well as one post here states, as long youve done your HW on the vendors prior to ordering, there is nothing to worry about. The other post brings a valid point of view to the table as far as what your typical mail looks like; origin and frequency and what not, but in all reality, as long as the letters/packages are proper, theres nothing to over think. <br /><br />&nbsp;I recently moved to a new town and ive had packs showing up since the first months of being here, when before which, i had zero mail, or shit from the people who used to live in this place, along with my two, maybe three bills. No real postal correspondence, certainly not internationally. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;You will be fine, just i cant stress enough how diligent you MUST be here..If not only to help protect your coin and not get G&#039;d by shit vendors or scammers, but also for the security and safety of both buyer and seller alike.&nbsp;

				Well the only reason my friend knows I ordered things from here is he introduced me to SR and the darknet. I know better than to sign for a package if I recieve one and all the things that I ordered can likely be sent in letters or small packages, which I do recieve now and then cause I can go on compulsive buying binges occasionally. Where I live is fairly rural and honestly I dont think they will look into me getting a cpl packages in a week or letters. Shit I get random ones from bill collectors all the time lol, if I ran a shop that would be my front as long as it could be sent in a letter. But anyways the only reason he bugged out is that I am getting a free sample internationally which, in all honesty will take longer to get here anyways than anything so they wont be looking at other mail before that if they do flag my address at customs. <br /><br />I&#039;m not that worried but my friend is worried for me, and thinks that I could possibly be linked to him which in all likelyhood since the only way we chat about anything like this is encrypted its highly unlikely they would ever look at him. I think he is just being paranoid, pretty much all the vendor&#039;s I bought from are legit with very high ratings, including the international one. I do have a free sample from a newer vendor coming so if anything gets me it will be that but I probably should know ahead of time since they have to get a warrant to check US mail and if it doesnt arrive by friday and all the vendors shipped on monday that would be a flag for me to move the stuff off site for sure.<br /><br />Anyways thanks for all your input hopefully I didnt do anything too stupid and ill be extra careful in the future and I know if they do try to come after me to shuut my mouth and say nada. Ive sent marajuana to myself from vegas before and had some sent by a family member which he barely stealthed it years ago and had no problems so here is to hoping. It had just been so long since ive had a few things I wanted to enjoy myself in this boring ass place before I move in a cpl months. Anyways im rambling cause I actually got some local coca thats decent lol *note to self dont post while buzzin*
