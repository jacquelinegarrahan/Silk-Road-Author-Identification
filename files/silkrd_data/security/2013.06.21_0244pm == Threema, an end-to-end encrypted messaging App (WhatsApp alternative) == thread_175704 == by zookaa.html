				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to spread the word: everybody should ditch WhatsApp and use Threema instead<br />Their website: www.threema.ch<br /><br />I&#039;m not exactly sure if they use exactly PGP or something similar, but it&#039;s public/private key based just like PGP, they don&#039;t mention PGP in their FAQ and they say they use an asymetric ECC based encryption instead of RSA. This means everything you send through Threema (text, voice, images, videos) is encrypted on your phone with the public key of you chat partner first and only then sent through the Threema servers to your partner.<br /><br />Now you can safely message with your friends without the NSA spying on you ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m surprised this post has been up so long with no replies. This looks awesome!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using redphone a bit, but the problem is that it&#039;s android only. As much as it upsets me, I have to adapt to the fact that a whole lot of people still use iPhones. (and god damn, do I hate iPhones!! xD) So it&#039;s good to se a cross-platform alternative. :)<br /><br />Thanks man!<br /><br />A +1 for you, my friend!

				TextSecure is an open-source and free alternative. Threema isn&#039;t open source so I would trust it less than TextSecure.

				Arrgh... but there are sooo many iTards with Apple products that can&#039;t run TextSecure. You guys really think Threema is potentially dodgy? I need a way to communicate with my iTard customers.

Or you could use PGP+email :P

Jabber is not currently accepting registration, Bonjour is an Apple product of some sort (and after some light seraching I&#039;m not immediately clear on how I would use that anyway), and Google is Google, so I&#039;m skeptical about using an NSA-soaked service such as theirs. Suggestions?

You don&#039;t need an @jabber.org address, you can use any XMPP service... Here&#039;s a cool one especially if you&#039;re talking about drugs : https://lsd-25.ru:5280/register/new&nbsp; an @lsd-25.ru address is way cooler than @jabber.org IMO :P No but seriously I don&#039;t recommend using that if you&#039;re talking about drugs. Here&#039;s a list of some free ones : http://xmpp.net/ You can also just download jitsi (cool OTR for the computer) and make an @jit.si account using that, so that you can use that account from the computer as well...<br /><br />And as long as all your chats are OTR encrypted, it doesn&#039;t matter that much if you&#039;re using it over google or bonjour or something else, just set the encryption to &quot;force/require&quot; so that you don&#039;t accidentally get or send unencrypted messages. Other XMPP services probably give out all your info too.
