				When I first got into the bitcoin game, the only way I figured out how to purchase them was to sign up with Dwolla to withdraw $ first. From there I found that BitInstant will transfer my $ to Mt. Gox to then purchase BitBoins then from there transfer to my SR account. Now through out that process I realize they always take a % for commission of transferring everything. I looked and kinda tried Escrow but do not understand it. Is there an easier process then what I&#039;m doing? or is this sufficient enough. Thanks everyone!

				Hi 123abc,<br /><br />I think BitInstant is the most convenient when you use the Moneygram option (CVS, 7-11, Walmart).&nbsp; But you have to be in the USA, I think.&nbsp; If you post your location (country), others can tell you what they do.<br /><br />I have heard of a service that offers lower commissions to get bitcoin (BTC).&nbsp; I can&#039;t remember the site and haven&#039;t tried it yet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, BTC commission are a fact of life and unavoidable, just like Silk Road (SR) commissions.&nbsp; But, hey, we all have to make money.<br /><br />You say you tried Escrow but didn&#039;t understand it.&nbsp; Do you mean SR escrow?&nbsp; Because that is how you buy on SR and you have to have the BTC first.&nbsp; Your money for the order goes to escrow.&nbsp; You can then release it to the seller when your package arrives.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s your protection from being scammed.&nbsp; If the package doesn&#039;t arrive, the vendor has to show proof of delivery or you get a refund (not always 100% refund).<br /><br />Here is a link to how I get my BTC:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=37143.msg421258#msg421258<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />

				Wow! I didn&#039;t know you could do it Via CVS. That&#039;s much faster then waiting for Dwolla to clear the funds (3-5 days) I&#039;ll try that. I&#039;m located in Wisconsin. Glad to hear I&#039;m (kinda) doing this right. I appreciate the reply!!

				I go to Wal Mart for all of mine using bitinstant :) Just go to bitinstant, and click the drop down panel for money gram, and then the next drop down panel for BTC Address, which you can get by clicking on &quot;Account&quot; on SR, and just copy and paste the long address. It&#039;s very easy, cheap, and quick. I think the longest I&#039;ve waited for mine is like 2 hours, and that&#039;s probably because it was on a weekend.

				I&#039;ll agree that Bitinstant &gt;&nbsp; Money Gram &gt; CVS/Walmart &gt; BTC addy&nbsp; &nbsp;is a easy way to get coin.<br />The only thing is if you go to a place that does Money Gram with the red phone is that you spend twice the time there having to repeat everything you say because the person on the phone is in India (not making fun of people from there just saying it&#039;s hard to understand each other).<br />Always use fake information when they ask your name, house address &amp; phone #<br />They might try to ID you sometimes they do sometimes they don&#039;t, just depends on who is working.<br />Just say you&#039;re paying a bill and you don&#039;t have a ID to open a bank account to pay your bills.

				A few questions:<br />Is it posible to use bitinstant with a TOR browser and a disposble email address?<br />Aren&#039;t there any risks accociated with depositing directly from bitinstent to a SR account?<br />Also, bitinstant is asking you for a city location before they let you print, would it be safe to give them your real city location?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38010.msg428692#msg428692">Quote from: Wilfred A on August 24, 2012, 04:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I go to Wal Mart for all of mine using bitinstant :) Just go to bitinstant, and click the drop down panel for money gram, and then the next drop down panel for BTC Address, which you can get by clicking on &quot;Account&quot; on SR, and just copy and paste the long address.

				1. Yes &amp; Yes<br />2. Sending it directly to SR wallet would be just like sending it to a online wallet then to SR wallet. You can always send your coin to a place like Bitcoin Fog to make your coins untraceable but that&#039;s up to you.<br />3. Yeah it&#039;s safe to put in your zipcode to for it to locate a place that does Money Gram, it doesn&#039;t save any personal stuff on the print out.

				Just wanted to chime in to say I used this method today &amp; it worked like a charm.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitinstant -&gt; cash/moneygram -&gt; Walmart -&gt; BTC wallet<br /><br />:)<br /><br />No issues except that the Walmart guy had never seen the zipzap form from Bitinstant before and wasn&#039;t sure how to do it.&nbsp; Lol.&nbsp; But, it got done eventually.

My guess is due to the account number that they provide :P<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure, that when you give them the location, it is only to show you where your moneygram locations are. Just helps you out.

				Everyone is saying BitInstant -&gt; MoneyGram -&gt; Walmart, but on the BitInstant site there&#039;s a MoneyGram Option and a separate Walmart option.
