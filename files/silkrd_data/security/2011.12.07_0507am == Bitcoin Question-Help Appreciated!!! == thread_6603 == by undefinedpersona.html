GetBitcoin is quite popular here.<br />2. There&#039;s cash deposit (at Chase and BofA branches) and cash-by-mail.&nbsp; Cash deposit will require you to e-mail them a copy of the deposit receipt, but is safe from theft.&nbsp; Cash-by-mail should be done using FedEx or PriorityMail (USPS) for both speed and safety from theft, but will cost more than First Class mail.<br />3. &amp; 4. If GetBitcoin needs to send you money -- a refund or when converting BTC to cash through them -- they&#039;ll be sending a check.&nbsp; They may be amenable to sending to a name and address different from that of the original order, but maybe not.<br /><br />Keep in mind, too, that buying and selling BTC is legal in most (all?) jurisdictions, however suspicious it may seem to some.&nbsp; If you *do* use your real name and address, you may want to pass the the coins through an insta-wallet or tumbling service for anonymization before transferring to SR.

				CrunchyFrog gave some solid advice. If anonymity was a big concern to you, you could look into using a moneypak-&gt;bitcoin transaction on the marketplace.

				I agree with using a different name and email address, tormail is a good place to have a anonymous email at.&nbsp; I think you wait longer with getbitcoin but i feel you get the most btc for your money.&nbsp; I spent 268 bucks the other day getting btc and by doing a money pack to btc transaction here i spent a good 30 bucks.&nbsp; I wish the mp to btc vendors didn&#039;t charge so much here cause it is very convenient and fast.
