				Hello all,<br /><br />Benn searching and dont see anything straight to the point so I would just like to ask, what are the best methods for &quot;cashing-out&quot; your bit coin safely from SR to a bitwallet?&nbsp; I am completely new, and have done all my homework, but I would like to hear from the people here who actually perform this task often.&nbsp; &nbsp; ??&nbsp; Just specifically regarding the actual cash out process, because the pinned-thread regarding all-in-one anon uses of SR is great for everything, just want to clarify is all.<br /><br />My skepticism comes from the FBI being able to track physical btc-to-money transactions via third-party exchanges etc such as mt gox.<br /><br />Please advise.<br /><br />Thanks

				No worries mate. Come and speak to me when you need to get rid of $5000 per calender month consistently, I generally take clients that hit the $3000+ per month mark and then vet them in some other areas too. I only take clients that sell illegal products.

I&#039;ll be honest, it&#039;d also be so I could show off a bit as well but I like to share the wealth sometimes.
