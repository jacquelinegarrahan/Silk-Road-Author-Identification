				My friend ordered bitcoins from a site (can&#039;t remember which one but I can find out if it&#039;s important) and they sent him a couple hundred dollars worth extra.&nbsp; He used his real info, but he wants to know if he can keep it or if he has an obligation to send it back.&nbsp; Anyone know the best way to act?

				Hey Batman, <br /><br />Are you absolutely certain that the wrong amount was sent? By this I mean, your calculations are taking both the BtC and dollar amount in the proper context? If so, I&#039;m split between asking you who the seller was so I can try and get a deal, OR advising you to email them back and explain the calculations. Maybe they made a mistake in which case you&#039;re morally obligated to contact them (think good Karma). If they didn&#039;t make a mistake then your conscience is clear and everything is well.

				Yeah spill the beans what site? I would wait a week or two before spending the coins to see if they contact you, if they don&#039;t, write it off as a happy accident

				I could find that out but basically the seller emailed him asking for the amount overpayed to be sent back to a BTC address.&nbsp; They did in fact send more than they should have, it was $300+.&nbsp; I just want to know if he is legally obligated to send them back or if he can just keep them.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to get the site.

				Do it for good karma, trust me. You ordered a set amount to order a certain amount of &quot;said product&quot;. Act like it never happened and return it. That karma WILL come back around to you and your friend.

				Inevitably I have to agree with Synikal. This burgeoning industry is already shady enough. SR is still quite young but I&#039;ve heard so many tales of scams and thievery.&nbsp; Let&#039;s give it a good name and do the right thing. If more people do this then we can collectively regain a moral high ground. So say I.

				But this isn&#039;t taking from the little guy, or anyone from SR.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel any moral obligations to this site, but it&#039;s not even my choice anyways.&nbsp; My buddy just wants to know if he can decide to keep the coins and if there is any way the site can try to recover them.

				Ok -&gt; I&#039;ll risk sounding like a Dudley Do-Right but dammit! , it&#039;s not about SR or big guys/little guys. It&#039;s about proper commerce. It&#039;s about having a free conscience. It&#039;s about trusting that when you make a mistake online (and you will at some point) that your actions have supported a &#039;good&#039; outcome for you and other people up to that point. If you help create an environment that is trustworthy then you can expect to live in a trustworthy place&nbsp; .... common sense applies tho.

				If he used his real info and they&#039;re based in the same country and not a shady operation then he&#039;d be wise to return them. Depending on where you are it could be theft, and even if not criminal then he can be pursued civilly.

				Yeah, it sounds like your mind is made up already. Ask your parents if you they think its ok since youre in such a moral dilemma.
