				I am finally ready to implement my new secure silk road setup but need to wipe my current HDDs. What is the best way to do this? I have heard DBAN mentioned on here before but is that enough?

				DBAN is a pretty good piece of software. If you plan on reusing the hard disk after wiping, only one pass of pseudorandom data should suffice. After that you can reinstall the operating system and continue using your PC. If you want to be extra secure (or you plan on disposing of the hard drive), you can have DBAN run with the standard configuration of 3 passes.

				Dunno how good it is but ive used acronis disk cleanser, there are various options. I think the fastest on a 1TB hdd was 4 hours, the others are safer but take longer.

				Only sure way would be take the HD to the river and toss or open and take the magnet which is a bit hard to do but fun to throw on your refrigerator&nbsp; ;o). Feels like spider man throwing a spidey tracer on the back of hobgoblins back or something haha. Anyways, they use heavy magnetic pull to leech your information off a low level formatted hd so if you got serious big time&nbsp; &nbsp;info there&nbsp; beat it once a part with a sldge hammer,&nbsp; burn it with some high temp fluid. Do not use gasoline. then thoss it in the river. Unless you got a good old fashioned blow torch&nbsp; &nbsp;you can make yourself a door stop.&nbsp;

				I wondered whether a&nbsp; single random write was really enough, so I did this experiment myself. I booted a Linux live CD and ran dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda. At 5 mb/s it took about 27 hours to write over a 500 gb hard drive. Then I reinstalled the OS and ran a program called PhotoRec, which scans the free space and dumps anything in finds (not just photos) into a folder of your choosing. It found some system files that appeared to have been deleted after the OS was resinstalled. It didn&#039;t find a single file that had obviously existed before the disk wipe. I had thousands of photos and mp3s on the drive before and it didn&#039;t find a single one of those.<br /><br />The FBI and NSA might have forensic technology that&#039;s much better than this app, but I doubt it. I don&#039;t think the data is magically &quot;watermarked&quot; into the drive. A single random write flips the bits and it&#039;s gone.

				It seems like a single pass is indeed enough but if you don&#039;t get the track edges there could still be residual data so you need to use a wiping system that can put the head off track center by some degree and do a two pass wipe (one on center and one off to get residual data)

The use case here is if you started doing &quot;sensitive&quot; things before employing FDE. In that case you should get an external hard drive, fully encrypt it, back up your data, then wipe the internal hard drive and copy your data back. I used dd instead of DBAN because I wasn&#039;t sure if DBAN did anything special and I wanted to know what a pure, straight random write would do. It appears to be sufficient.<br /><br />For the record, if you want to go this route, the full command was<br /><br />dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda bs=1M<br /><br />I did it without defining the block size and it ran at 3.6 mb/s, probably because it used a smaller default block size. Setting it to 1 mb increased the write speed to 5.0 mb/s. You might get even better results with a larger block size.
