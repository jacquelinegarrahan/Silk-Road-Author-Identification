				I am kind of new here and was just wondering if these big posts that seem to be warnings to get off silk road have always been around? For the people that have been here since the beginning. I just see them a lot and after getting ripped by tony I get paranoid.

				They are just trolls mate, don&#039;t let it get to you. <br /><br />Tony MAY have been caught but if he has then it&#039;s most likely through being clocked making big transfers/withdrawals at the exchanges or just being unlucky because he is dealing IRL or something like that.

				molly, I noticed the same thing -- there seems to be more of these warnings on here lately.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just trolls taking advantage of some of the negativity and paranoia surrounding the recent scams.&nbsp; They all lack credibility for various reasons, IMO.

				thanks for the reassurance....I would still like to hear from someone that has been here forever that posts like that have been around since the beginning. I guess I just wish Tony would pop in and tell us he ripped us off so I don&#039;t have to keep worrying that some canadian cop is drooling over my address somewhere.

Look out for new sellers form Canada in the near future...<br /><br />

				You&#039;re an idiot, everybody here knows there is a risk, nothing is full proof. ALL you are doing is spreading your bullshit paranoia. EVERYONE is here by choice, and choose to stay here, maybe cause for them there is far less risks involved from ordering drugs online than getting off their local street dealer. <br /><br />So for the last god damn time, shut the fuck up.

				Indictment was probably from then, people are often indicted quite a while before they are raided and the indictment is then released after those indicted are in custody <br /><br />People facing federal charges are frequently indicted months or years before they are raided and arrested, but after they arrest everyone its generally public knowledge immediately.

				Sealed Indictments are handed down by the Grand Jury.&nbsp; It &#039;s up to prosecutors do decide when they&#039;ll unseal(make public) them.&nbsp; Evidence gathering doesn&#039;t necessarily stop once they&#039;ve gotten their indictment.
