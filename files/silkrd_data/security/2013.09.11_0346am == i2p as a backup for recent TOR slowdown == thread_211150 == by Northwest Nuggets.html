The one thing it currently offers that Tor doesn&#039;t is plausible deniability. Since every node relays traffic, it&#039;s difficult for a connected peer to determine whether traffic is originating from you or being relayed by you. However, overall I2P presents more problems for SR users:<br /><br />1. The network has 10K - 20K concurrent nodes. Each node learns about ~200 other nodes and relays traffic for about a dozen. That means 200 other nodes will know your IP address. An adversary could spin up a few hundred nodes, and even with a lot of overlap, they could enumerate the IP addresses of most users.<br /><br />2. That in itself is not so bad, because of plausible deniability, but it is extremely bad for vendors, who can be reduced to a very small geographical area. Given the size of the network, there won&#039;t be more than a handful of I2P users in any city. If LE can determine which city or geographical area a vendor lives in (trivial), it would not be hard to investigate a handful of users to identify the vendor (starting with a list obtained from the attack above).<br /><br />3. A paper was recently published which demonstrates several &quot;practical&quot; attacks on the I2P network, including one that links users (source IP addresses) to the sites they are visiting: http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~spjsschl/i2p.pdf<br /><br />4. Identifying eepsites (the equivalent of hidden services) is not as well researched and probably easier than identifying hidden services.<br /><br /><br />Problems 1 and 2 can be countered several ways. A VPN can protect against fishing expeditions on vendors; I2P has a &quot;hidden mode&quot; that reduces your exposure to other nodes; and presumably if we all migrated to I2P, the network would gain at least 50K users. There are still problems with these solutions.<br /><br />Most SR users don&#039;t use anonymity networks the way you are supposed to use I2P. On I2P, everyone is a relay, so you are supposed to keep your client running all the time. Most SR users want to hide the fact that that they use Tor. They use leave-no-trace-behind operating systems and get on the network only when they need to. So if the average SR user gets on Tor for half an hour a day to check the status of an order, then at most we would be adding 50,000 / 48 = 1040 concurrent users at any one time, not enough to make I2P safe to use. Of course, that&#039;s an average and there are noticeable swells in activity at certain times of day, where there may be 5K - 10K SR users on Tor, who would be on I2P, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s enough to make the network safe.<br /><br />Making the network safe would require SR users to change their behavior -- AND a few hundred thousand more users. :)<br /><br />Furthermore, nodes in hidden mode don&#039;t relay traffic, so if thousands of SR users joined I2P in hidden mode, they would probably DOS the network with their traffic like the botnet is doing to Tor.<br /><br />There are probably other problems I haven&#039;t considered, but these alone should be sufficient to convince SR and our community not to move to I2P.<br /><br /><br />What does I2P need before it&#039;s a good alternative for SR? 500K users. A million users. Something in that range. That would probably mitigate the problems I listed above.
