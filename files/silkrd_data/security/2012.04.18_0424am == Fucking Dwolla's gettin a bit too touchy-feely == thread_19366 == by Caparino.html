				Can&#039;t you just create a fake Facebook page and link to that? I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s going to cause any problems. I already went ahead and set mine up so that next time I need to send to Mt. Gox, I can just link to that. Although the 30 day requirement is going to be troublesome for new users that want to get bitcoins fast. It used to be that the wait for your bank account verification took about a week. Now you have to not only wait for that, but also wait the extra 30 days for some arbitrary reason.

				Gusman I believe you need to meet all four requirements not just one.<br /><br />But I am kind of curious why people are sketched out by dwolla all of a sudden, it was always linked to your bank account anyway. If anyone&#039;s cashing out via dwolla they&#039;re a crappy drug dealer anyway so hopefully this new anti fraud procedure by dwolla makes people trade bitcoins more anonymously.

				I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re all talking about with the Facebook thing. Today I did the whole Dwolla verification thing and nothing was like that at all. You have to create a Hub page, which is basically just your Dwolla account, but they do not force you to link with any social networking site whatsoever. Maybe because I&#039;ve been a customer for a while I get an exception or something? Or you just read it wrong. All you have to do is give your social security number, but you already had your bank account linked to Dwolla, so it&#039;s like your identity is suddenly more compromised. The anonymity comes from the Bitcoins that you buy later. As long as you&#039;re smart with those, you&#039;re all set.

				I can confirm linking to a social media network is no longer a requirement.&nbsp; When I attempted the transfer the other day, there were a list of 4 things I had to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I said screw it, because I flat out refuse to provide that sort of personal info for a financial transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;I returned today and there are now only 3 requirements (ssn, hub page, 30 day deposit).&nbsp; The facebook/linked in/twitter requirement is gone.<br /><br />Still don&#039;t like it, but whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(

				I don&#039;t understand this Bitinstant thing. Isn&#039;t Dwolla to Mt. Gox using Bitinstant anyways? What is the best option available to you on Bitinstant, and what is the rate you have to pay? Dwolla is only 0.25 which is ridiculously cheap.

				Yeah, I ran into that &quot;Hey, what&#039;s your SSN and photo ID look like?&quot; shit on Thursday. I had to manually find a buyer for coins, which normally isn&#039;t too bad. The overhead is a little much, but it&#039;s safer, since day traders take Dwolla. I&#039;ll still use Dwolla for that, but I guess I won&#039;t be doing business with Mt. Gox.<br /><br />SIGH
