				So when you are posting internationally, And want to post an item anonymously, How would you go about it? <br />I suppose wearing disguises when going into the post office would work, Is there International stamps you can buy and then just stick your letters into post boxes? <br />Looking for the best viable options, prefferably from people who have to do this on the regular. <br /><br />Cheers all . Advice is appreciated

				Depending on the size of your package, you may have to add a CN22 customs declaration on your package but I think you can just frank it with stamps and ship it without going at the post office, there are international stamps in some countries. Inside the EU there shouldn&#039;t be anything special to do except a higher price.

Whats the size when you need to add a declaration? I suppose il be able to just look up how many stamps required to which country. I recently recieved one from across the ocean with only one stamp on the letter. I was intrigued to see if i could do the same. Ok no problem, Higher price, From the post office though i assume ou mean?

				Well you should have a price list on the website of your postal carrier. Most countries have international stamps, then you can just drop them in the post box. I&#039;d weigh them too to make sure you paid enough for postage. <br />I think larger bubblewrapped envelopes and bigger require the CN22 declaration. You can send normal letters without it but I don&#039;t know the specifics, you can probably find that info on the clearnet... One thing I&#039;m sure of is that if it&#039;s a box, it needs a declaration (it can just be bullshit, most don&#039;t get opened anyway). <br />To send weed, which I remember you&#039;re gonna be selling, I&#039;m almost positive you&#039;d need that declaration on your package, unless you turn your buds into powder and send it in a letter :P

Am i right in thinking that the CN22 can be dloaded and then just applied to your parcels. <br />Lmao yes keeping the buds uncrushed is going to be one of my main priorities without a doubt. I have noticed that Mbb&#039;s happen to be that &quot;metallic&quot; way, So does that show up on Xrays etc,&nbsp; I reckon il need to stick something around them.. Not sure where to start really, I have been really busy doing my research over the last couple of weeks, Maybe you could PM me some details just any insights to do with posting you might have, I appreciate everyones help and am asking every single person i can, Il send you my PGP if you wish. Would you say marking it as a gift would be decent as it avoids tax, or would you say do it otherwise. <br />I just checked a 31gram package sent overseas via airmail and got quoted 8 pounds 50. Seems a bit expensive dont it. <br /><br />Thanks mate Hff

				The CN22 is required for anything more than a letter if going outside the EU, you can pick up rolls of them from the post office along with the blue airmail stickers.<br />MBB&#039;s and heat seal foil don&#039;t show up on x-rays, they look the same as plastic.<br />When you check the size and weight for postage don&#039;t forget to check the thickness too, this is where vendors have messed up in the past and the packages get held for insufficient postage.<br />Marking as a gift doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t get hit with an import tax, but it&#039;s pretty rare. <br />31g will cost £1.88 as a letter and £3.50 as a small parcel, £8.50 would be for tracked and signed for. :)
