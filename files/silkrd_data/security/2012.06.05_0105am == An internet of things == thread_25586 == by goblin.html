				The CIA doesn&#039;t have a server large enough to store all that data so it&#039;s bullshit. More scare tactics.<br /><br />I remember a friend recently from the security services telling me how he had to sit in a van for 2 days to crack (brute force) peoples WPA protected wireless networks when they wanted to check what they were up to (terrorists etc), needless to say I laughed my head off. I wasn&#039;t going to tell him how it can be done in 2 minutes, so I feel fairly safe still.

				It&#039;s not enough to have the server space and power. You need to put in a prohibitively large amount of man-hours to sort the information you&#039;re capturing, even if you get some awesome facial recognition software to automatically delete footage without people in it.<br /><br />Sure, it&#039;d suck to know that they&#039;re filming you, and if they were specifically investigation you it&#039;d be a real danger, but the chances of this sort of surveillance being feasible, and of it actually improving their chances of spotting illegal activity, are so close to zero that someone should start a religion about it.

				I believe they have the capacity to do this..<br /><br />Remember, the technology that the public knows about is typically 10-20 years behind what is top secret, classified technology. <br /><br />And even if they don&#039;t, we should assume they do, so we are prepared any way. But to be honest, I do think that silk road is, eventually, doomed. Not any time soon though. But sooner or later some ridiculous legislation will get through, or some postal scanning technology will be implemented.. etc. I mean if you showed someone from the 50s an ipad, they would think you were a sorcerer. The same will be true in another 60 years, the technology then will be so ridiculously advanced that it might be a mockery to even attempt anything like silk road, as much as say robbing a bank now without a mask is.

				Remember 1984&#039;s telescreens? They sound quaint by now, don&#039;t they?<br /><br />To all the Winston Smiths out there: don&#039;t buy new appliances, stick with all pre-2012 stuff. Better safe than sorry.<br /><br />And all kidding aside, you know they&#039;ll try to sell all this to the great fucking dumb American public as a great &quot;convenience&quot; (Why yes, Mrs. Tate, this nifty gadget will call a repairman automatically when having a problem, no need for you to worry!); and the great fucking dumb American public will swallow it whole, as usual. I&#039;ve never seen a population that&#039;s so willing to not only bend over, but to eagerly drop their pants to all the better get sodomized. <br /><br />Fucking morons.<br /><br />goblin
