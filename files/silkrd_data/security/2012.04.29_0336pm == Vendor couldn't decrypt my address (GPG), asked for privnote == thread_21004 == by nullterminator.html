				Hi all,<br /><br />A very reputable vender couldn&#039;t decrypt my address (encrypted with their pub key using GPG). We tried several times.&nbsp; The person also said that my encrypted msg seemed way too small. I am 99.9% sure that I am using GPG correctly.&nbsp; I have only had one previous transaction, but it worked for the previous vendor, and I tested my procedure locally using my own pub/priv keys. This vender suggested I send it using http://privnote.com.&nbsp; This bothered me a bit, but I ended up doing that.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m wondering if this could mean the vendor was somehow compromised.&nbsp; Or maybe there is some incompatibility between GnuPG versions? Any thoughts?<br />

				Ok, so at this point I sent my address via the privnote. What should I do? Should I cancel the order?&nbsp; If so, how to do that?

				As a vendor, this has happened more than a handful of times. I don&#039;t know how people mess up the encrypting of their addresses, but no customer has complained about privnote before. <br /><br />When it happens I say, please try again making sure they used my public key or use privnote. privnote usually is what most people use.

				I think the fear is that the vendor&#039;s been compromised so they can&#039;t use the PGP key and are trying to get an address out of the buyer. I don&#039;t know how likely that is, but that is what I understand the worry to be.

				Yes, that is exactly my concern.&nbsp; Although I&#039;m probably just being paranoid.

				This happened to me a few days ago (as a vendor). I got a dedicated TOR system and moved everything off my old system but forgot to get my private key before I destroyed my old drive... so here I am with orders pouring in using my old public key with no way to access it... I did send my new public key to the buyers who used the old one and I got most resolved but a few kept giving me problems. I am in no way against using privnote as it can be accessed via TOR so I don&#039;t know why people have such a problem with it. <br /><br />A little paranoia is a good and necessary thing in this business but when the axe drops it is not the buyers who are going to be in the paper...<br /><br />TJ

				The compromising thing is not very likely because with access to the vendors account, one could easily swap the public key with its own.

				There is nothing wrong with privnote. <br /><br />The fact the vendor couldn&#039;t decrypt is weird though. I&#039;ve had times when the buyer encrypted stuff to the wrong email, but I just told them that and they fixed it. If this isn&#039;t the case then I wouldn&#039;t deal with the vendor. Better safe than sorry.

I tried the public key on their profile twice. They also sent me their public key via message, and it was the same as the one listed in the profile.&nbsp; Tried it for the 3rd attempt anyway. I tried encrypting using the email from the public key twice, and once using their name from the public key. <br /><br />The error this vendor is getting is supposedly &quot;no encrypted data found&quot;. Anyone know what might cause that?<br /><br />Another weird thing:&nbsp; The vendor said that my encrypted message looked too small (in size) by a third.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t make sense to me because the successful one I sent to another vendor, and the ones I&#039;ve tested locally using my own public/private keys, are exactly the same size.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t think the size should look wrong and makes me wonder why someone would say that.<br /><br />It just feels fishy.<br />
