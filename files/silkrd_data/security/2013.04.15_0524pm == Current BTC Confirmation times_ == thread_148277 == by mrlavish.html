				I did a transfer about an hour ago and it still isn&#039;t even showing up in the blockchain. I&#039;ve had transfers take hours and hours but never have had one still not show up in the blockchain after so much time.<br /><br />What are some of you guys currently having to wait?

				Well just an update in case anyone was curious. It took about 1 1/2 hours for the transaction to even show up in the blockchain, but once it did it received 6 confirmation in under 40 minutes. As a matter of fact i checked it and it showed nothing, then after 5 minutes i rechecked and there it was with 3 confirmations.<br /><br />I have had confirmations take up to 6 hours before, but have never had the transaction not show up in the chain before for hours. It has always shown up almost instantly.

				The transaction times are terrible recently.<br /><br />I think it is because of twisted priorities. All the immense computing power of the network is bent towards mining coins, and not processing transactions.
