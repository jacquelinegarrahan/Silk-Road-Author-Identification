				I was browsing a bitcoin trading site(bittylicous) and it struck me how easy this place could be a trap (or maybe im paranoid). The site asks for you to register (fair enough) then it asks you for your email and a password at the same time. It almost tricked me into thinking i had to put my email password in, This got me thinking to obviously use a different password to my actual email password. so once i did that i rolled a spliff and got thinking how basic the site looked(fair enough). <br />So I started thinking these fuckers could use this as a trap to enter your emails, and i forgot to use tor while going on the site. Plus its a clearnet site. Im thinking this because bitcoins are notoriously linked with silk road. So why would some guy just want to &#039;help&#039; out the bitcoin market in the uk, what would his motives be. I rigistered and started to regret cah he could find my ip address right?<br />What you think people tell me to STFU if im being paranoid.]

				It&#039;s been said many times but it bears repeating: bitcoins are not just for drugs, and they&#039;re not just associated with SR. &#039;Nuff said!

				Maybe not an entire btc trading site- but definitely an individual btc trader.<br />Perhaps they monitor btc cash trading meetings as they happen all over the world.&nbsp; Take down car rego numbers and do a look.<br /><br />I am thinking they will look at btc trading to get at SR traders

				Gambling. You have a perfectly legal gambling problem, you pissed your bitcoins away on Satoshi Dice, BitVegas, Poker sites and so on. Maybe they could do you for tax evasion?
