				Just a couple of quick facts.<br />1)FBI/DEA/TLA scrapes and archives everything that is written on this forum.<br />2)Assume your trusted buddy is a fed.<br />3)Never give out personal information and anyone who gives you personal information should be highly suspect.<br /><br />Follow up<br />1) This is trivial and all of them do it. Erasing does not help, they log it as soon as it is entered<br /><br />2) These guys are very good at making friends, they do it for a living. The most awesome guy might be a narc. Don&#039;t tell them&nbsp; anything you would not tell a cop under any circumstances. <br /><br />3) Never vouch for or exaggerate your relationship. Cops will tell you fake (or real) personal things to get you to trust them. It is natural human reaction to share back. Don&#039;t do it. Be friends about safe topics. Feds will hang out for decades waiting for you to let your guard down. <br /><br />If you have said things you regret, let it go or disavow them if you can<br />If you have said things a cop could use against you deny it and move one<br />If you have trusted someone that you can not actually vouch for take it back

				Good point, I call it the &quot;everyone is a cop&quot; theory.&nbsp; Forget doing it for a living a real LE would flip someone and use them as a CI since they would actually have knowledge of drug use, ordering, etc then probably do what they do in real life, try to get the CI to vouch for the LE or if not just use him for intel.&nbsp; I know if I was LE and I had the power I would much rather have a guy give me intel and let him bounce around from forum to forum over the years.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long LE can do this but I&#039;m sure when it&#039;s feds they will find a way.<br /><br />But &quot;locally&quot; this is the rule of the jungle since someone can get flipped within an hour of leaving and the controlled delivery can happen the same day.<br /><br />The way I look at it is since all are LE, or will snitch when caught there is actually no way of knowing.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have to be nice, I&#039;m an asshole and have as good of a chance as being one as any.<br /><br />What office are you out of?&nbsp; You guys still rent offices out of Koger/Kroger exec buildings?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2) These guys are very good at making friends, they do it for a living.

				why not just have a bunch of fake information?<br />two or three names, two or three addresses spread through the country. hell, go international if you want.<br />Bonus points if the addresses are real.<br /><br />if anyone asks, they get fake info.<br />if a second person asks, they get DIFFERENT info.<br /><br />there are a variety of services that will create fake info, just do it on the fly.<br />But yeah,&nbsp; what he said.

				Eh, I dunno. I have a feeling since the DEA can&#039;t even keep a handle of drug-trafficking in the real world; gang activity surrounding drug sales; &quot;terrorism post-9-11&quot;, I really doubt they&#039;re all sitting around watching this forum. The transactions here are mostly misdemeanors, some even tickets. <br /><br />If the FBI doesn&#039;t even care about (or can&#039;t assign task forces) to drug dealers in neighborhoods (despite multiple citizen complaints), do you REALLY think they have the funding to care/task-force this place? Untraceable ISPs, inability to detect currency trails? If they can&#039;t even nab a drug dealer in the &quot;real world&quot; WITH that information, I&#039;m not gonna assume they will be able to here.<br /><br />I agree it&#039;s better to keep all your information completely private, anonymous, and confidential. But I will not assume that every conversation I have on here is with a narc/cop/LE and sit here peeping out the damned windows.

				I&#039;m pretty sure that the Gawker and Wired articles got SR it&#039;s own little task force (probably 2-3 people) at the DEA.<br /><br />At the moment, it&#039;s probably not any kind of priority.&nbsp; No matter how much the DEA, like the IRS, would love to bust SR and garner a nice fuckton of publicity.<br /><br />But my mantra on this whole issue stays the same: let one kid of a rich, famous, or political person die from what they bought here and you will see the NSA assigning 50 people to assist the DEA just to find the SR servers and who&#039;s behind it. <br /><br />Let&#039;s just hope everyone here gets to use their drugs recreationally and enjoys it. :)

				Yeah, I have noticed seemingly frequent posts from kids who apparently have wonton cash available at their disposal to convert to BTC and supply their snobby coke habit. Must be rough! Hopefully none of their parents are anyone of importance (according to US&#039; definition of &#039;importance&#039;).

				NSA wont ever get involved to shut SR down even if ten rich kids die from drugs here. Furthermore NSA doesn&#039;t need 50 people to find SR server, they most probably already know its exact location. They don&#039;t share intelligence with other agencies. Also, if NSA wanted to they could use some combination of zero day from their vast arsenal to covertly root SR server and then root people when they login with some firefox/chrome/ie exploit and report IP address back to them. Hiding from NSA online is much more difficult than installing Tor on a random server and it isn&#039;t very likely that anyone here is capable of doing it.

				Yes, I agree. It should be kids play for NSA to track down SR, just that it has no interest in it, it&#039;s paid to track terrorists.
