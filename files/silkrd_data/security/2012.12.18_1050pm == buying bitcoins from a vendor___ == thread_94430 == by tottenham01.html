				Buying coins from SR vendors is a bad idea. This has been discussed many times before here on the forum. You should look around for other options IMO. Search the forum for previous threads about this issue. If you search the posts by member grahamgreene, he has commented on this numerous times and outlines his reasons for you to consider.

Once his name shows up, click on it then click SHOW POSTS. That will show you all of his posts. Just search through them until you find what you need.
