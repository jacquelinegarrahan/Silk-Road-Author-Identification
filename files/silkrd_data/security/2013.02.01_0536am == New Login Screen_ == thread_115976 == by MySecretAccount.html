				Did I space on this, or is there a new login screen with a &quot;Forgot Passcode&quot; or whatever choice under the register option. I don&#039;t know how you&#039;d use it, and I didn&#039;t click it, but - was this planned? Maybe a midnight deployment?

				It wasn&#039;t there when I signed on this morning, but I just signed out and back in a few minutes ago and noticed the same thing.&nbsp; Definitely new ... hopefully planned!

				I saw this and thought it was kinda off.. Hopefully its no BS.. SR has&nbsp; been down off and on all day maybe their changing a thing or 2. I dont know how we could retrieve our password though when we never put any secret questions in if it was lost or forgotten.. Far as i know our PIN is the only other thing..<br /><br />RIGHT?

				I tested it with a throw away account. After entering username and pin it says:<br /><br />Your password has been changed to &lt;password&gt;<br />Please log in immediately and change it via account-&gt;settings<br /><br />After logging in, everything seems normal. I think it&#039;s a new feature to recover lost passwords.<br />

				Probably easier for SR staff than having to address lost password problems individually / manually.

				I saw it as well and thought it was really odd, so i double checked i wasn&#039;t on a phising link ,But everyone else seems to be seeing the screen as well so i think it might be ok, If an admin addressed this it would put my mind at ease.

				I tried that &#039;forgot password&#039; function with a throw away account and it seemed legit. It just asks for your username and PIN and then generates a new password for you. You then log in using the new password and change the password immediately. I obviously wouldn&#039;t try it with an account that had funds on it, but as I said, it seemed legit.

				An official post on this would be much appreciated.&nbsp; First time I tried logging in it apparently timed out, think I had a small heart attack &quot;knowing&quot; I&#039;d just given up my password.&nbsp; Alas second attempt no issues.&nbsp;
