				Hey all,<br /><br />I usually deposit around 300-400 dollars at once through bitinstant but I was wondering if theres more efficient ways to deposit over $2000 without raising suspicion.&nbsp; Should I make multiple deposits through bitinstant or is there another way to make large deposits for btc? <br />Thanks

				If you have a bank of america near you, use bitfloor. Btw, bitme has the same $500 max as bitinstant, but is faster and has no fee&#039;s.

				I&#039;m planning on investing a few K in BTC this week, probably via mount gox.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to send any of this money to SR, just ride it on the BTC market for a while.<br /><br />Would sending a bank transfer wire to MtGox pose any security problems or raise any suspicions?&nbsp; Especially considering that I&#039;m not using said transfer for SR at all, just investing?

They&#039;d have you on record, and it doesn&#039;t matter that they&#039;re bought for actual legal purposes because they have to assume&nbsp; that you&#039;d tumble them through a few wallets to get to SR. They can&#039;t ever know for sure that they&#039;re going to drugs though. It shouldn&#039;t really pose a security problem or raise any red flags too high, but like a said, they&#039;d have you on record and that is the only reason I&#039;d say not to do it. Down the line there is a very small chance it could bite you in the ass, but in reality if the legal system has got you, your bitcoin trail won&#039;t matter too much, it&#039;d just be another piece of evidence in the trial against you. <br /><br />Basically, your decision should depend on how heavily involved in SR you are and whether you mind being in the database. You might just go to multiple banks anonymously as suggested above for the peace of mind.<br /><br />PS: Good idea though, I&#039;m doing the same, just not through mt gox.

				DO NOT do multiple orders through bitinstant. Every time I try to move over $500 through bitinstant my 2nd moneygram gets stuck, and they obviously don&#039;t know how to fix the shit because it&#039;s happened 4 times now. Waited a week at one time for $500 to clear..... I went with bitcopia. Max is $1k/day, and it&#039;s all done through Wells Fargo bank deposits. I was going to use Blue Sky Traders, but there is no Bank of America around me.

				Okay, so in bitfloor there&#039;s an option for a limit order. If I set it at the price I bought the BTC at, is there a chance that I may be able to get my money back?

ZipZap receives the money, and BitInstant then gets it, but neverrrrrr moves it to my desired account. Every time this happens, I send an email to them and they give me the same answer every time. As I said in the previous post, I waited a full week for $500 to clear when I told the vendor the order would be put in the same day I did the moneygram. Least I have waited is probably two days after I email them. Just throwing out my bad experiences with them for other members to see.<br /><br />I&#039;m just going to stick with Bitcopia for now until I start seeing problems with it. No ID required, and you do not have to fill out any information, so I don&#039;t have to worry about faking the shit anymore, and Wells Fargo is like Starbucks around here. EVERYWHERE

				I would use a combination of the methods listed thus far. I use BitInstant when urgency isn&#039;t an issue, but if I need to move more money at once I&#039;ll combine using BitInstant and Bitcopia to get up to $1500 transferred in a day. I prefer BitInstant because it uses less money than Bitcopia, I ended up with closer to $900 than $960 after using bitcopia and bitinstant only takes $40 for every thousand. I can&#039;t use bitfloor because the closest Bank of America is a state over, but it seems legit as well.
