				Hi all, I have a strange problem. I am using gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.18 on OS X 10.7.4. The way I tend to use PGP is I use my text editor, highlight the text I wish to encrypt, and select &quot;Open PGP: Encrypt Selection&quot;. Then I copy the contents into the SR PM system. This works most of the time and I can decrypt messages sent to me the same way. Before I can encrypt using a seller&#039;s key I copy their public key to a text file and save it on a secure drive. I then use the GPG Keychain Access program to import the key. Once imported, I can encrypt with it. Well, usually!<br /><br />The problem is I have come across a seller that doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I have imported his/her key successfully into the GPG Keychain. I see it in the list of available keys. But when I select text in the editor and select encrypt selection that seller&#039;s public key is not in the list. This is happening with just this one seller. All the other keys work fine. The imports and seems to be valid. I haven&#039;t yet tried this on the command line. I&#039;d have to do some digging to learn how. I&#039;m a pretty technical guy and comfortable with BASH shell but I am not familiar enough with Open PGP to know how to do this without more research.<br /><br />I tried searching google and the forums here and have not come across anyone with this exact problem. I&#039;d rather not post the seller&#039;s name publicly here but will PM it to anyone who believes they can help.

				There are a few possibilities:<br /><br />A: You already have imported the PGP key... That implies the vendor is using the same public key for two different SR accounts, one of which you&#039;ve already messaged before now.<br /><br />B: The vendor doesn&#039;t have their PGP name/email as something similar to their SR username. I have dozens of contacts who are almost worthless because of that practice, it&#039;s a pain in the ass to double check who is who if you don&#039;t use your SR username as something similar to your PGP handle/email. It doesn&#039;t improve your anonymity and it doesn&#039;t help anybody who wants to send you an encrypted message that&#039;s for sure.

				Excellent thoughts Pine. I don&#039;t have that many keys imported into my GPG Keychain. On quick inspection, I don&#039;t have many that don&#039;t have an email that mimics their SR name. I just compared the key to these and it is different text. What&#039;s interesting here is that the vendor does show up in the GPG Keychain Access display.&nbsp; I can see their key and export. To double check I copied the public key from their SR profile again and reimported and it said:<br /><br />count of processed keys: 1<br />count of unchanged keys: 1<br /><br />After looking at the keys I&#039;ve imported I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve imported this same key under another name, but that was a great guess. And it doesn&#039;t look like the vendor picked an unfortunate name either since I see the seller right in the list. This is strange. I wish I knew that other people can successfully encrypt using this seller&#039;s key before I waste a lot of time debugging. There&#039;s a chance I may be using this seller again. I am really uncomfortable with unencrypted or 3rd-party encrypted addresses (as in privnote.com).<br /><br />Thanks for taking a shot at answering this. Are you really a gorgeous woman? Nothing I like better than a woman who knows how to get geeky!<br /><br />I think the next step is for me to learn the command line tools<br />&nbsp;

				Interesting question Guru. This site has obviously caused me to rethink security practices. I happen to agree that there is little harm in people knowing someone is married or what country. I&#039;d even say that saying something like &quot;west coast&quot; is not particularly damning. I&#039;ve noticed some users are very eager to share details in feedback from purchases such as &quot;3 days NYC to Wy&quot;. This strikes me as a bad practice since it sort of &quot;outs&quot; the seller. I&#039;m still learning things here myself. I over-shared in the forums originally and I&#039;m going back and editing. A very wise user suggested I do this&nbsp; ;)

I see it as a &#039;garden of information&#039;. There are hedges to prune and such, it is not really a chore for me. For example; even if I used a new handle per post, it would still be understood from my communications that I must be able to write and speak English, and therefore I automatically belong to a smaller set of the people who use the Tor network than the universal set.<br /><br />But, I believe giving away any information that is geographically specific or a social identifier is a bad idea in general. This is because in an intersection attack, those kinds of facts can be complied into a list of things which by themselves do not identify me, but all together they may do a fairly good job of it. i.e. intelligence rather than a direct giveaway. In fact, all of detective work is fundamentally based on the fundamental principal of counting when you get right down to it. The way to trip it up is to lay countless artful red herrings, which is why almost everybody here is doing just that in some form or other, intentionally or no. Some go further and adopt entire identities from publicly available information on sites like facebook to put down a false trail, and there&#039;s a kaleidoscope of clever technical tricks to give similar impressions of which I&#039;ve no doubt you&#039;re aware. And of course, I may be utilizing styleometric software to disguise the unique fingerprint of my posts with a false one.<br /><br />Naturally, there is a certain limit to this work/logic. Like I said, I write English, and not everybody using Tor does. The advantages of communicating far surpass the disadvantages of giving away certain identifiers like the language you speak. It is important to build reputation in any business community to be respected. But in general, I choose to adopt more generic language, or use words which represent a larger set than the one I intend to be understood with. On a related topic, I sometimes don&#039;t use generic language for the same reason, contradictory as that may sound, but often this is a ploy because I&#039;m self taught in so many disciplines that the species of my language is quite honestly a poor guide to who I appear to be in public life.<br /><br />As for what point such activity becomes useless, it is not known, because one can make mistakes. That is why the caution over a detail such as my sex. Why reduce the universal set by a whopping 50% when I wouldn&#039;t get such a magnificent return on any other kind of information being made generic. So there you have it.<br /><br />To answer your question more directly, I think being hidden in a set of 10 million possible identities is sufficient room for maneuver, but the more the merrier of course. I think I&#039;m one in a million naturally, but not quite so egotistical to imagine I&#039;m 1 in 10 million ;-)<br /><br />Protip: Don&#039;t use the same or similar a password as that which you use on SR or the forums, also on any common web based service like Facebook, Gmail, Hotmail et al. That would catch out many people, what do you think are the odds that certain organizations receive a copy of the password list before they get stored in an encrypted database. Probably it is defacto state policy in many places once a corporation reaches a certain significance to install &#039;audit&#039; software for &#039;Data Protection&#039; or &#039;Consumer Protection&#039; or what have you. I mean, that&#039;s what I would do. So I don&#039;t.<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;m afraid that it is useless to edit information from these forums FGM, because LEO almost certainly page scrap every single instance of change that occurs on here. Once the information is out, it is permanently out there, that is why you follow the &#039;Pine Paradigm&#039; you read above.<br /><br />Paranoid (but content) Pine

So, I&#039;d recommend something like Keepass/Keepassx or Figaro&#039;s Password Manager to store your passwords. Protect these with a 10-12 word Diceware passphrase. It might take you a week or two to memorize it, but such a passphrase would yield 129-155 bits of entropy. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve clearly been doing this for too long because I can come up with passphrases with larger entropy sizes than that off the top of my head.&nbsp; That said, Diceware is a very good idea to recommend to others.<br />
