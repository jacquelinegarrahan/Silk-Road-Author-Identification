				So, hypothetically, I sell a decent amount of marijuana locally-half pounds/pounds not like a not but more than enough to be a felony.&nbsp; A friend of mine who&#039;s parent works for the local police informed me today that I am on some sort of list of people to be picked up at some point for questioning.&nbsp; So... what should I do other than get rid of all my illicits?&nbsp; How long would be a safe period of time before continuing business as usual?<br /><br />Thanks!<br />-Flavourful

				It depends. If your about to be indicted, keep in mind that the investigation can continue for years after the initial warrant is served. Get some bond money and a lawyer ready.

				can i be indicted if I have nothing illegal anywhere (car/house)<br />The most they would have i could imagine would be phone records<br />None of my money is in banks or anywhere that could be tied back to me<br /><br />-also I&#039;m a minor if that matters at all

				if you&#039;re a minor, then I would imagine they will bring you in for questioning, and tell you they &quot;know you did X,&quot; and use a lot of scare tactics to try and get you to talk.&nbsp; KEEP IN MIND THAT THEY MAY KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU, BUT MOST OF THIS INFORMATION IS OBTAINED ILLEGALLY; no matter what they say, even if it is true, deny it, and if possible, try to go ahead and get a lawyer before they bring you in; when they bring you in, simply tell them that you cannot talk w/o your lawyer present, and call the lawyer that you have arranged to represent you, and do not talk (do not say anything, you have the right to remain silent) w/o your lawyer even if they tell you that you will get a better deal; they&#039;re lying; most likely, unless you have a bunch of friends that will narc you out, they cannot do anything as long as you are not currently selling, and most of the &quot;evidence&quot; they have against you will be inadmissable in court; as for business as usual, you would probably need to change your name and SSN, move to a new location, and take other drastic measures; otherwise, lay low for the next few years b/c they will not take you off the list

				NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE. NEVER. Get it? NEVER!<br /><br />Do not tell them anything under any circumstances ever. Do not listen to what they&#039;re telling you, they can lie, and believe me they do. They&#039;re better at getting people to talk than you think. Fuck that, don&#039;t say a goddamn word at all. Lips should not be moving ever after you indicate that they will have to consult your attorney regrading any questions. Simple as that. Don&#039;t tell them a story. Don&#039;t tell them anything. Don&#039;t offer a legitimate alibi if you have one. Just don&#039;t say a word. I really hope you understand the point I&#039;m trying to make here. Talking to the police benefits you IN NO WAY EVER. IT CAN ONLY WORK AGAINST YOU, NEVER FOR YOU, EVER -- don&#039;t even think about believing any truffle snuffer that tries to convince you otherwise.<br /><br />Watch the YouTube videos called &quot;Don&#039;t Talk to the Police&quot; pt 1 and 2. The first is a law professor who makes it very clear why it&#039;s the stupidest thing you can ever do, even if you are completely innocent and have the most airtight alibi ever. Part two is a cop who confirms everything he said, a cop who interviewed thousands of people and tallied up thousands of felony convictions, many of which were a direct result of PEOPLE INCRIMINATING THEMSELVES BY TALKING TO THE POLICE. SO DON&#039;T EVER FUCKING DO IT.<br /><br />Peace!

				As if it hasn&#039;t been stressed enough, do not open your fucking mouth beyond the ability to say, &quot;I will not speak until there is a lawyer present.&quot; Do not let the police get you mad. They will try to provoke outbursts in some way, maybe they&#039;ll try to scare you or anger you. They might say things like, &quot;You&#039;re going away for long time&quot; because they NEED you to talk. They have shit on you, the most they may have is secondhand accounts from some guy arrested for pot possession. So stop selling your shit now and when they do inevitably take you in, don&#039;t bother playing dumb or acting confused. Don&#039;t play anything, don&#039;t act anything. Don&#039;t SAY a goddamned thing. You go into the station with a completely blank face and silence and they will not get you for a thing. You&#039;re safe as can be assuming they don&#039;t have video evidence of you doing anything, and they obviously don&#039;t or you&#039;d have been brought in by now. The fact that you&#039;re on a list means they&#039;re still trying to pin something on you.

				Please consult a lawyer immediately.&nbsp; Many offer free consultations.&nbsp; Don&#039;t rely on the words of one lawyer.&nbsp; Instead, write down the hypothetical situation along with your questions and consult with, at minimum, three lawyers.&nbsp; Analyze their responses for consistency and use your best judgement of whom to retain as your legal counsel.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a lawyer but have had some legal training.&nbsp; Assuming you&#039;re in the States, it seems like they do not have enough evidence at this time for an arrest.&nbsp; To that end, like many have said, they are looking for evidence by employing various psychological techniques to elicit an emotional response during your questioning.&nbsp; The fact that you are a minor complicates things.&nbsp; They can not, by law (depending on jurisdiction, of course) question you without your legal guardian&#039;s consent and presence.&nbsp; Your parents are free to decline but this tends to piss them off.&nbsp; Follow the advice of others on this post when it comes to the interrogation room--shut up and let the lawyer talk.&nbsp; That&#039;s what you&#039;re paying him or her for.<br /><br />Back to the evidence.&nbsp; They probably have enough probable cause to search your premises.&nbsp; It&#039;s critical that you separate yourself from any incriminating evidence soon without raising suspicion to yourself.&nbsp; This means no discussions about any of your activities over insecure channels.&nbsp; Start doing things people around your age do and stay low until the heat goes away (or when they find a new target or burn up their budget).&nbsp; Good luck and stay safe.

				Thanks for all the advice! I&#039;ll be sure not to speak other than to ask for a lawyer<br />If I&#039;m not questioned or anything in the next month or so should I just assume I&#039;m not being watched/received bad information?
