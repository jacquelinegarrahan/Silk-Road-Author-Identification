				If this is not terrifying enough for you, I don&#039;t know what could possibly be. The GHCQ, NSA&#039;s equivalebnt in the UK, has literally walked into the offices of the British newspaper The Guardian (this is the paper that has been publishing all those juicy, and frightening, revelations on NSA and GHCQ spying around the world, as revealed by Edward Snowden and written by Glenn Greenwald), and demanded that they destroy ALL the hard drives containing the Snowden files.<br /><br />They actually stood over the shoulders of Guardian employees watching to make sure they were in fact destroyed. Naturally you know the Guardian must have multiple copies of these files in other locations and probably encrypted all over the internet (as most likely does Greenwald), so the damage is really minimal.<br /><br />But the point is that we have now crossed the threshold to honest to goodness Gestapo tactics in the west. If this doesn&#039;t chill your blood, or make it boil, you&#039;re not human.<br /><br />We are on the verge of tyranny in all its disgusting reality, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before the US starts doing the same in its territory.<br /><br />This in addition to the unlawful 9 hour detention of David Miranda, Gleen Greenwald&#039;s partner, at Heathrow airport, on a trumped-up terrorism fishing expedition. This was done absolutely to intimidate Greenwald, and to send a signal that the big boys are about to start playing really rough with dissenters and whistleblowers from now on.<br /><br />Stay tuned, folks, the future looks veritably dystopic.<br /><br />goblin

				Agreed this is very disturbing, but I&#039;m not at all honestly surprised. With all the revelations that have came to light lately, thanks to the true American hero, Edward Snowden, they seem to be engaging in these gestapo tactics all over. <br /><br />I personally feel that way about the whole Lavabit shutdown, you don&#039;t get much more gestapo than saying &quot;either do what we want or you are out of business&quot;. May not be murdering a person, but definitely a business. Sadly we will quickly see the few Americans that actually put their integrity before greed being lambasted by the government and media for doing the right thing, but at least we know who&#039;s on our side.<br /><br />I certainly hope we get more whistleblowers and more of the truth to come out. Someone needs to get these assholes in check and I can tell you, the pacified American public certainly won&#039;t. But on the bright side, since this all came out, I bet Tor and other anonymity services have seen their user base grow exponentially which will hopefully thicken the soup they are trying find people like us in.
