				+1 for training yourself to remember it. Typing it 20 or 30 times will help, you can access this forum from SR on the bottom right side of any page within.

				Since I have a terrible memory and cannot seem to memorize the URL, I just copied the link into a text doc and saved it on a password protected encrypted drive. May seem like overkill, but I just open the drive when I open my Tor browser and that&#039;s that. :)

				remembering the url is the most secure way i guess!&nbsp; <br /><br />If you dont want to remember all your urls, i think this is a good and easy way to store bookmarks and still be anonymous: I&#039;m using TAILS installed on an usb-storage drive (If you dont know about this, its a live system which comes with TOR and basic tools (for example PGP) and leaves no traces on your computer, because after every shutdown everything is going to be deleted) and then I made a persistent volume which allows you to store your bookmarks and other documents permanently! (encrypted of course). you can get it here (together with very good tutorials on how to do all this):<br /><br />****CLEARNET WARNING*********<br />https://tails.boum.org/news/

				whats wrong with just saving in an encrypted text file or within a truecrypt volume? Even if you were under investigation and the man was able to somehow break though that, having a URL written down doesnt make you guilty of anything as far as I know.

				Bro as long as u have your tor and pgp stuff on a encrypted USB , Just Bookmark it..Iv got over 30 book marks ..<br /><br />And download disckcryptor its not as good as trucrypt&nbsp; but u can encrypt your USB with tor and stuff u dont want seen and if someone were to try to take it out and plug it into another usb it will show your usb is blank like its never been used ...I do that..<br /><br />Also for back up I copy and paste all the address i use on TOR to the Clipboard on your PGP u use to encrypt your address info, God i hope your not so new that your just sending your name and sending info with out PGP?<br /><br />Anyway copy all the address to clipboard encrypt it then click on your name u made and save the file some where on your comp..No one will know what a pile of rubbish is...Sound good??<br /><br />If anyone see&#039;s any holes in what i do please tell me so i can fix...&nbsp; Diskcryptor is not the answer to computer itself full security like trucrypt cause u can take a true cryped usb to any comp, anything done on diskcryptor has to be mounted on the system its downloaded on.....<br /><br />Im working on switching to Linux now, iv got ubuntu running side by side but cant get my broadband to connect me to the net..issues issues....
