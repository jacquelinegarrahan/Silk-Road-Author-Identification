				Decided to make this thread because of the recent disappearance of a vendor (Gelman).<br /><br />This has happened before at SR and will happen again many times.<br /><br />You will see a great vendor with flawless feedback and poof, he will disappear.<br /><br />Most of times, either vendor is just taking a break or closed the shop.&nbsp; The least likely and worst case scenario would be the involvement of LE.<br /><br />For example, the vendor Gelman has been around for a month with 100% positive feedback and disappeared with the money STILL sitting in his account.<br /><br />What are your average buyer supposed to do in this kind of scenario?&nbsp; People say clean house and stop ordering to that address for a while.<br /><br />But, it can be a burden clean house or getting a new address for that matter.<br /><br />What is your take on this?&nbsp; What kind of measures do you guys take when your past vendor disappears?<br /><br /><br />

				SR vendor One Stop Shop has stopped filling orders and is not communicating with buyers. Many orders are unfulfilled and negative feedback is piling up. I wonder if they were busted, or if they are just screwing over their buyers?

				How about 3 weeks plus? With no product received and private messages ignored? Is SR going to DO something?
