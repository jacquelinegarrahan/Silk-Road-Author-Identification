				Clipboard is a computer term. When you select a piece of text and copy it, it is said to be on the &#039;clipboard&#039;. Then you can paste it in another document or file.<br /><br />To import someone&#039;s public key, select it, copy it, and paste it in a notepad file. Save it as something like: &quot;pubkey.txt&quot;. Then import that document in your GPG program.

They will need it if you want them to send you an encrypted response to your message. <br />No. You don&#039;t need to sign it. Once you select the public key of the person you want, that message will be encrypted and not be able to be read without your Private Key.<br /><br />This link I&#039;ve put here will give you loads of info from some trusted members here on this forum. There is an abundance of threads to have a look at should you want to.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38861.0<br /><br />Hope that helps.&nbsp; :)

Just make sure you send the vendor your Public Key as well, in case they need to contact you about something you wish to remain private between you and the vendor.&nbsp; 8)

				Have you created 2 sets of keys (1 x Public Key and 1 x Private Key for each of the 2 sets) and the public keys have been swapped and imported into GPG&#039;s Key manager, so the sender has the recipients and the recipient has the senders. This is solelor this exercise of sending messages to yourself. To send one, write the message then use one of the public keys, the one given to your pretend recipient, to encrypt it. Then &quot;send&quot; it via email. Once you receive it, you&#039;ll need to use the private key from the public key used to encrypt the message to decrypt it and read it. Then (using the senders Public Key), open clipboard and respond to their message then encrypt it with their Pub. Key. Once you receive your message via email/PM, Copy /Paste to the clipboard, hit decrypt and enter your private key to read it.

				When you open GPA (GPG), the first screen you should see is the Key Manager, where each of the Public Keys you have imported from people you wish to correspond with, are displayed. I&#039;m not 100% sure what your trying to say. As I said, the Key Manager just looks after the storage of your saved Public Keys. GPG key chain access?? Not sure exactly what your doing here but once you open GPG , you are immediately on the Key Manager page showing your saved Public Keys.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
