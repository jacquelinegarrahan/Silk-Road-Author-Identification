				My PC is fairly modular with quick access to the hard drives (open the side, remove SATA/power cables and take HDD from sliding drawer).<br /><br />What I do is take my OS hdd and remove it any time I am expecting a package and put in a safe off site location.&nbsp; I&nbsp; leave my game drive (ssd) and storage drive (storage drive is mechanical and also boots to win) connected.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also remove the SATA and power cord from my PSU (modular as well).<br /><br />I only order personal amounts of mary jane, so it&#039;s nothing too heavy.&nbsp; But, I was wondering with the main os hdd removed and leaving the game/storage drives connected, how much information about what I do will they be able to get from my pc should it ever be seized?&nbsp; Not that I am expecting that to happen, but just out of curiosity!<br /><br />Thanks!

Yep, I did mean leaving the game and storage drives connected.&nbsp; The PC will boot off of the storage drive (I intentionally put win 7 on it).&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t know what they could figure out from what might be stored on those drives and on the RAM.<br /><br />Thanks Astor, +1 to you.

				I think astor&#039;s response is probably right (as usual), but there&#039;s more to it than that.&nbsp; Since you sound like you&#039;re asking out of curiosity and not irrational paranoia, there&#039;s a few things: for one, Windows can be configured to keep the swap file on any drive -- I generally keep mine on a different physical hard drive than the OS runs on, for instance (so loading a program and loading something from swap can both get the full I/O of the disk if it comes to it).&nbsp; Unless you play with the settings manually though, I think it&#039;ll be on the same drive as the OS installation is.<br /><br />Operating systems are massive beasts though, and there&#039;s a whole lot that they do.&nbsp; I mean a whole lot.&nbsp; File indexing for faster drive searches (which includes some kind of content indexing that I have no clue about, BTW) is just one thing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where that data is stored.<br /><br />The volume shadow copy service comes to mind -- I was never clear on exactly wtf that really does, but it sounds like it could have fragments scattered throughout drives.&nbsp; The Windows registry is actually stored in fragments of different files all over the place, but I should think that would be almost entirely on the boot partition or the one Windows is installed to.<br /><br />You call one your &quot;game drive.&quot;&nbsp; That means you install programs directly to it?&nbsp; I have no idea if that means Windows keeps fragments on that drive.&nbsp; If it&#039;s formatted as NTFS though, there&#039;s data it stores in a normally non-accessible location on the disk (non-accessible from Windows that is).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what that data is or how incriminating it could be, but it&#039;s there.&nbsp; Basically the problem is that almost nobody knows everything Windows is doing anymore -- including a lot of the guys who helped write the thing -- so there&#039;s almost always something to find if you dig deep enough.&nbsp; The idea behind physically damaging the drive is to make it absolutely impossible to recover.<br /><br />Nobody knows everything, and everyone makes mistakes: if you don&#039;t make your plans to be resilient to the little mistakes you&#039;re *going* to make, then they could easily get you fucked if you&#039;re selling.&nbsp; But you&#039;re not, so you personally would be a waste of time and money to do serious disk forensics &quot;against.&quot;&nbsp; If they wanted to prove you use Silk Road though, I&#039;m willing to bet someone they pay very well could get enough data from your system to testify that you do.&nbsp; I have no real idea how *I* would go about doing that, but it&#039;s what these people do, ya know.
