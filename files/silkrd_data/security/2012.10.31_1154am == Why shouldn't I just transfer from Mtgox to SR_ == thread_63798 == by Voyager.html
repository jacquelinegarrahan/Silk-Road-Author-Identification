				<br />Might be viewed as stupid question but as I&#039;m a buyer and not a vendor, what are the real risks? The greatest seems to be the vendor gets busted and my address is found ... Unless the Police immediately hot foot it to my home the odds are I&#039;ve already used up whatever I&#039;ve bought.

				just better to be safe than sorry...&nbsp; any extra effort for them to link you to SR will help ensure your security. when a pig gets hungry and cant get a big fish, it will eat whatever little fish are flopping around right in front of it <br /><br />its very simple just to send through a couple instawallets, one of which you only access through tor <br /><br />given mt gox is connected to you, this just provides an extra amount of plausible deniability that it wasnt you but someone you sent the coins to

				Once I add funds to my mt.gox account, can I withdraw them to a btc address while my account is &quot;unverified&quot;. I usually don&#039;t deal with mt.gox, but I may have to seeing as what&#039;s going on with bitinstant right now.

				yes, i believe as long as its below 1000 dollars per day (or 200 btc/day not sure which is accurate, look up on mt gox) and you dont exceed the monthly limit, $10,000 maybe

				I had made my first Bitinstant &gt; Mt.Gox purchase this weekend.&nbsp; I had to show ID when I made the deposit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if this is how it goes everywhere.&nbsp; Due to this, it&#039;s definitely a good idea to move your coins around before throwing them into your SR wallet.
