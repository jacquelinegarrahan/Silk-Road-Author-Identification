What if it&#039;s about a politician (or group of) trying to make a name for themselves in an election year?&nbsp; You have someone who wants to put a feather in their cap and say &quot;Oh, look at what good I&#039;ve done&quot;, get a few headlines, and get a few votes in the end. <br /><br />For someone who is looking for that kind of victory, going after SR *is* worth it and if that politician sits on the right committee they would have virtually unlimited resources.&nbsp; Have SR tied to RICO (cause RS is a Corrupt Organization in the mind of politicians) and they can and most likely are throwing money at taking down SR.<br /><br />Also, for a bit more perspective: If anonymous can determine that Lolita City servers were in the US by a coordinated attack and watching the TTL responses, and they did that with limited resources, just how far back can the Fed be?

The only difference is that they have way more resources backing them up than the DEA does. If the government wanted to find DPR, I bet they could it would just take so many resources that it&#039;s not even worth it because there are way more dangerous local drug traffickers they have to worry about. I mean look at the Mexican Cartels, they&#039;re straight up decapitating enemies/civilians and no one is doing anything about it because of the amount of resources it would take, resources they don&#039;t have, I feel the same applies to SR except DPR isn&#039;t decapitating people and videotaping it for the public to see.
