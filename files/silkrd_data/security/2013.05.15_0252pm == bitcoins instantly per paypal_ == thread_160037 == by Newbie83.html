				i don&#039;t know if this is wanted or allowed here, couldn&#039;t find anything about that.<br />my matter: because of the falling btc-price i bought not enough btc for buying something at sr. when i&#039;d do it the normal way (by bank transfer) i&#039;d have the needed amount too late (we have a long we in germany. before this i URGENTLY need something).<br />i got a reliable buyer account at sr. i could buy your btc by paypal (i need only fckin 0,37 btc). i know that this method wouldn&#039;t be so anonymous as the most people want it here. but i&#039;m in need and if somebody could sell me these 0,37 btc, i could pay it by paypal.<br />if here is somebody who trusts me the needed amount can also be send and i pay it back in the next 2 days.<br />please write me a pn.<br />if this isn&#039;t allowed here i apologize.<br />when somebody here is in love with me you could also show your love by simply sending me btc, but this is not necessary.<br />1GMx27H1CZsYXsqRrTt4PC8RKCg3i4TSCK <br />(this is a fresh address)<br /><br />when my concern is allowed this thread could be a great beginning of btc exchange for people who are in need.

				don&#039;t want to beg because i&#039;d feel like a little piece of shit... but i&#039;m really in trouble.<br /><br />this thing seems to be allowed or at least tolerated because the thread was only moved and not closed by a mod.<br />so it would be really cool if we get this kind of help running...

				This is absolutely NOT allowed here. There is also the risk of someone getting scammed out of their Bitcoin by accepting PayPal as a method of payment, due to the fact that it is reversible, so it is doubly-not-allowed here.<br /><br />Locking this thread.<br /><br />Libertas
