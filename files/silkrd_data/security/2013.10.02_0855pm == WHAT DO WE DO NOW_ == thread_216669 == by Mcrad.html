				I think I&#039;m layin low for awhile as far as any online drug buying goes. First Atlantis, then SR, any alternatives will be next.

				i heard a few ppl complain about SM saying it looks really cheesy and unsafe and BMR i have heard good and bad things about, i am not sure if those sites are even safe and who is to say that LEs are not starting these sites to trying and swallow up more ppl, it a shame that DPR had to slip up like that and cause this mass mess amongst us, but i thought there was a back up button DPR could use and i wish he would so we could all access everything real quick and take care of things

				Off Course they are next in line.<br /><br />One only has to hope they are more prudent security wise than DPR turned out to be.<br /><br />I have used BMR succesfully in the past as a vendor, so that is my go-to market from now on. I just have to start from scratch which sucks of course, I lost a lot of money. But I&#039;ll climb my way up again, rest assured. This couldn&#039;t have happened at a worse time, I had a lot of money in escrow and my order was not yet sent.<br /><br />:(<br /><br />Remember that you can turn off the automatic encryption in BMR. If you encrypt manually, you should be relatively safe if you are a buyer even if shit hits the fan like it did here.<br /><br />I have no experience on those other markets, and for the time being I wont go near them.<br /><br />Stay safe everyone!

They are the only ones with the knowledge and power to restore access to SR, and that&#039;s if the feds didn&#039;t physically seize the server and leave a new one serving a seizure notice in its place.<br /><br />Many of us either have families or switched sides to law enforcement now, so hacking back SR from the feds is probably not going to happen. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t anonymously help revise all the dated algorithms, protocols, etc protecting online privacy and the ability to stay hidden. Thanks to the complacency of the early internet generation--the only ones that could have seen this coming from the start--the mythical &quot;echelon&quot; became a reality as soon as sniffing almost the entire internet became technically feasible.<br /><br />Although at this stage it looks like SR fell as a result of DPR&#039;s incompetence, we can&#039;t rule out the involvement of the NSA or perhaps covert FBI abilities involving tor. Either way, tor is not a long term solution, and neither are current encryption algorithms.
