				N.B This is a lot of fun and a good way to understand how the Bitcoin network operates a little better!<br /><br />Whether it&#039;s an electronic wallet, a paper wallet or a brain wallet, you need to have both a public and private key. In simplest terms, your public key is a Bitcoin address where coins can be sent. Your private key is used to access the coins stored at that address.<br /><br />A brain wallet quite simply involves you memorising a private key so that only you can access your Bitcoins - in essence carrying your wallet in your head.<br /><br />This is so easy, it can be done in three steps.<br /><br />1. Firstly think of a memorable phrase or combination of words such as &quot;I love Family Guy.&quot; What we&#039;ll do now is transform that phrase into a viable Private Key by using the cryptographic SHA256 function.<br /><br />If you have Linux, there&#039;s a command for this, example below:<br /><br />echo -n I love Family Guy | sha256sum<br /><br />If you don&#039;t use Linux shame on you but there are a number of websites that can do this for you, try : http://hash.online-convert.com/sha256-generator<br /><br />Whichever method you use you&#039;ll get a long string of meaningless numbers and letters, in this case:<br /><br />c3be1d4cf39643e384cda6074f8ff39aff7c725fe30fd5358abf7193af1d1d19<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry you don&#039;t have to memorise this!<br /><br />2. Use your Tor Browser to go www.bitaddress.org and click the tab labeled &quot;Wallet Details.&quot; Disconnect from the internet then paste this long string into the box named &quot;Enter Private Key (any format)&quot;. Click &quot;View Details.&quot; <br /><br />The website will generate a BTC address at which you can receive funds.<br /><br />3. Send your Bitcoins to the Bitcoin address at the top of the page and congratulate yourself on having your own brain wallet!<br /><br /><br />- How to check your balance:<br /><br />1. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 above using the same words or phrase you used before to generate your private key.<br /><br />2. Highlight the Bitcoin address at the top of the page and copy it.<br /><br />3. Go to www.blockchain.info and paste the wallet address into the search bar at the top right. The website will show you the current balance.<br /><br /><br />- How to get the Bitcoins out of your head! :-D<br /><br />1. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 above using the same words or phrase you used before to generate your private key.<br /><br />2. Highlight and copy the row of numbers and letters on the page below where it says &quot;Private Key WIF (51 characters base58, starts with a &#039;5&#039;):&quot;<br /><br />3. In a new tab, go to www.blockchain.info and click create new wallet. <br /><br />4. Click the &quot;Wallet&quot; tab, then click &quot;Start a New Wallet&quot;. <br /><br />5. Once you&#039;re logged in and have opened your wallet click the tab labeled &quot;Import/Export&quot;. Click Continue.<br /><br />6. In the box underneath where it says &quot;Import Private Key&quot;, paste the private key you copied earlier and click &quot;Add Private Key.&quot;<br /><br />7. Your wallet will sync with the server. You can then click on the &quot;Send Money&quot; tab at the top to send the coins to another online wallet or a wallet on your computer.<br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />V.<br />

				Interesting. Do you think it would be unwise to have bit coins from bitinstant sent to my Tormail, then to this wallet, then to SR? Or would bitinstant -&gt; tormail -&gt; SR suffice?<br /><br />Noticed recent blocks on bitcoinblock show transactions of over 30,000 BTC... wow, but that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean the people who sent that amount were using this method does it?<br /><br />I like this method though.

				Brain wallets are best if they primarily receive coins but send infrequently if at all. <br /><br />Anytime a wallet sends BTC out it reveals an address. <br /><br />Brain wallets should be your longterm super secret squirrel stash.

				Correct! <br /><br />Of course you don&#039;t have to memorise this - just have your BTC sent there. You can retrieve it any time by inputting your private key at the bitaddress.org website. I&#039;d recommend disconnecting from the internet first though, just in case someone&#039;s monitoring your exit node. :-D<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23792.msg249415#msg249415">Quote from: wretched on May 20, 2012, 01:58 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">so your I Love Family Guy address would be<br /><br />19X4Hm7e6pBuNBXcHtdUhjntUgaFixN2Nk<br /><br />right?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for this philter, an excellent point.<br /><br />Brain wallets could be said to be more secure in that you don&#039;t need any wallet software or online wallets to receive funds (although of course you will need to redeem your private key using a provider like Blockchain.info in order to send BTC). As such they&#039;re an excellent place to put your savings as you only need to carry a few words around inside your head!<br /><br />However, whether it&#039;s a brain wallet, paper wallet or e-wallet, you still have to send BTC from the address at which they&#039;re received. The principle is exactly the same as for PGP - if someone sends me a message encrypted using my public key, I must first decrypt it using my private key before I can then encrypt it using your Public Key and send it on to you.<br /><br />As such it&#039;s going to offer you no greater protection from block chain analysis - of course there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t pull the Bitcoins out of your head then send them directly to a mixer like Bitcoinfog, just as with any other type of wallet.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23792.msg249522#msg249522">Quote from: philter3 on May 20, 2012, 03:57 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Brain wallets are best if they primarily receive coins but send infrequently if at all. <br /><br />Anytime a wallet sends BTC out it reveals an address. <br /><br />Brain wallets should be your longterm super secret squirrel stash.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
