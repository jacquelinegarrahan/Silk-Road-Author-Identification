				Basically i transferred £400 into Mt Gox&#039;s uk account about 4 weeks ago. I have been emailing them back and forth, they say they are waiting for a bank statement so they can credit people&#039;s accounts accordingly. But they also say Barclays have closed their account. I have tried contacting Barclays but they dont let me explain the situation due to Data Protection. I contacted my bank after about a week, do you think i could go to them again to try and get it back? Anybody close to MT Gox know whats happening?<br /><br />Thanks

				I think you can ask your bank to claw it back.&nbsp; Tell them that the account has been closed.<br />

				Update: I phoned my bank today and explained once again what was happening. After speaking with the manager she came back to me and said that because it was not banking error, i should try and get Barclays to investigate it. Now i will try and talk to them about it!

				I&#039;m in the exact same situation, please let me know if you manage to get your money back or what Barclays says this time if you go there and ask about it.&nbsp; It is really fucking annoying being ripped off by MtGox for over a thousand pounds which is what seems to have happened to me and I&#039;m sure others too who sent them money last month before the account was closed/suspended or whatever happened to it.&nbsp; It is now mid-October and still no definitive word back from them as to when (or if) I will get the money back

				I called Barclays this afternoon and was told if the account was closed the money would come right back to the sender , he said more or less what mtgox is saying about the final statement with all our transfers ... Looks like we are stuck with mtgox ... To be fair they are very attentive and have assured me that the funds are not lost ,, but if I had transfered £1000 I would be pretty upset ... Hopefully we will get our money soon ...

				I have had two transfers bounce back from mtgox in the last two days. I have been in contact with mtgox and they say Barclays are no longer accepting payments. Unlike your payments mine bounced back immediately. Going to need a new method of buying coin. Pain!

				mtgox just said they didn&#039;t know anything about it, and it took em a week to even notice their acct was closed, pretty feckless imo your best bet is to speak to your bank about getting the money back afaik barclays havnt told em anything and probly wont.<br /><br />i was gonna buy bitcoins thru mtgox but im worried their a scam now<br />if they cant access their own acct how can they pay you back out when you sell ur coins
