				We all have at least one. <br />I was busted by the cops during a DWI checkpoint. The policeman quickly smelled the herb in my car and asked if I had any, I said yes, then he proceeded to do a search, to which I let him. It was already too late to hide anything, I had 7 grams of stanky bud in my center console. They took it from me and well luckily I was let go with a summons for court ticket thing, no arrest. I took it up a lawyer $750 and ended up getting the whole thing changed to a littering fine. I also had to do a drug and alcohol course. Which was bullshit. <br /><br />What I learned was to always have my bud covered. Never again will I travel in a car with unsealed bags of weed. Always have a smell proof jar, glad plastic box, or a vacuum sealed apparatus. <br /><br />Share your stories!

				you should have learned to deny everything!<br /><br />i&#039;ve had two similar experiences with cops and checkpoints.&nbsp; both times had weed in my car (once it was an ounce), and nothing at all resulted from either one.&nbsp; I said absolutely nothing besides denying everything and telling them I did not consent to a search.
