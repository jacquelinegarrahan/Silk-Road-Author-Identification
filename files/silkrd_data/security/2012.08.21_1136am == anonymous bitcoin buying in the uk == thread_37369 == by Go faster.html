				For small amounts (&lt;60GBP):<br />Set up an account on mtgox.com using a private VPN/public wifi. Do not use TOR or your home internet connection. Once the account is set up then there is an option to deposit funds into a Barclays account through a bank wire. You can take this account information, go into a branch and ask them to pay however much it into their account, be sure to give all reference numbers and ask them to type it in capitals. The account will be credited in around 24-36 hours and at this point you exchange the pounds for bitcoin and withdraw to a bitcoin address. Downside is they may ask for ID but you run that risk, this works for me in small amounts. Up side is they only take 1.5% for a cash deposit to the bank.<br /><br />Larger amounts (&gt;60GBP):<br />Search for Vlad1m1r in the forums or on the market. He offers a cash in the post for bitcoins service. For under 130 he charges 12.5% for under 1000 he charges 10%

				Vlad1m1r is your least hassle option, otherwise you need to set up mt gox account, set up a VPN, deposit cash at the bank, transfer from mt gox to SR.<br /><br />You can get Vlad to deposit straight to your SR account. He has good feedback and is regularly on the forums if you need to ask him anything.

				I use MT Gox over vpn.&nbsp; One point about the cash deposit, you can fill in a deposit slip and put in the self service slot at a Barclays branch, no need to speak with anyone, could even get someone else to go in a post it for you if you&#039;re that worried. <br />Balance will be available within 48hrs in your MT Gox account. So far (granted only started using this process) had no issues, and haven&#039;t seen the 1.5% deduction mentioned on their site... :)
