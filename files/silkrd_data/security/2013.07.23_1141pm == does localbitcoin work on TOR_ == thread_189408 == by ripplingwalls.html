				Isn&#039;t it risky to login to a clearnet site like localbitcoins via Tor? Wouldn&#039;t it be better to use an anonymous vpn for this?<br /><br />pb.

				I&#039;m pretty sure localbitcoins has some but not all tor exit nodes blocked.<br /><br />They probably don&#039;t block all of them, just the ones that abusive traffic comes from.<br /><br />Just keep hitting &quot;New Identity&quot; in vidalia. You&#039;ll get it eventually.

				I think it pays to be cautious here. No one knows at what level localbitcoins is cooperating with LE. They could be maintaining a list of users who only sign in via TOR (the exit nodes are well documented online.) From there, it&#039;d only be a matter of flagging accounts with suspicious activity. Just saying, don&#039;t draw unnecessary attention to yourself&nbsp; :-X

				TOR is allowed and completely accepted. Traders are notified if a buyer is using TOR so they can decide whether or not to sell coin to the tor user.
