				LOL Limtless! I&#039;m pretty happy with the service of Intrsngo so far but yeah I also tried to convert to some Bitcoins today and my order got stuck so I cancelled.&nbsp; I&#039;ll wait keeping my money in the original currency until resolved. Also I&#039;m pretty shocked with how high the price for Bitcoins has climbed over the past couple of months - I hope this is reflected by vendors lowering the Bitcoin price for their products!

Sad to say in the UK the possibility of your defence being scrutinised in this way before you arrive in court is becoming increasingly likely as you&#039;re required to submit a &quot;defence statement&quot; before appearing in court so that they can go over any defence you might present, most unsporting in my opinion.<br /><br />The only safe methods for obtaining Bitcoins is either buying them with cash or selling goods/services in exchange for them. Of course if someone donates them to you as Lim&#039;s associate did, so much the better - sounds like you have a generous friend Lim, can I have his e-mail? :-)<br /><br />If you absolutely insist on using bank deposit I would suggest you do so via BitInstant using cash if you&#039;re in the US and run your coins through Bitcoinfog - cash deposits are still traceable in that banks have security cameras but it would require closer monitoring of your activities and LE may not have the energy to do this for small time buyers - nevertheless my completed unbiased opinion as a Bitcoin trader who deals exclusively in cash is that you should play it safe :-D<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If we&#039;re talking a Kilogram of coke then I&#039;d be much more inclined to agree with it being seen as going down that way, but for the odd gram? Come on.<br /><br />I know the names and addresses of plenty a person I dislike, and if having them investigated, arrested, bought up in front of court, etc, was as easy as sending them a gram of cheap, badly packaged cocaine in the post, then wouldn&#039;t that seem a little too easy?
