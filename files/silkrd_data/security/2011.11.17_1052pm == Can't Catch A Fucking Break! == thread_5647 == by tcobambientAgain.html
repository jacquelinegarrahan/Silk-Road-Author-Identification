				I&#039;ve had nothing but bullshit the whole time here on SR.&nbsp; Phished, Wallet locked up.&nbsp; So I try to open a new wallet and send myself some bitcoin through get-bitcoin.com.&nbsp; I set up my new wallet.&nbsp; I deleted my old wallet because I couldn&#039;t get to the coins so I said &quot;fuck it&#039; and started over.&nbsp; Or so I thought.&nbsp; I set up my new wallet but didn&#039;t realized until today after I sent money to get-bitcoin.com that it&#039;s actually my old wallet and if I try to download my bitcoins I&#039;m fucked and won&#039;t be able to get to them.&nbsp; So I&quot;ve been emailing get-bitcoin to see if they could just change the address to my new wallet that I finally got set up correctly and of course, they won&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I have all the emails, I have the Wells Fargo receipt, etc...&nbsp; All I need them to do is change the address to my new wallet so I can get the bitcoins.&nbsp; Won&#039;t do it.&nbsp; The fucking bitcoins are just going to sit there and aren&#039;t going to be picked up by anyone because it&#039;s my old wallet.&nbsp; So the coins will sit there indefinitely and they will I guess eventually just take them out of circulation when all they have to do is just make the change to my new address.&nbsp; Fucking bullshit!&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to rip anyone off.&nbsp; I have all of the paper work and emails and photos of receipts.&nbsp; Just push a couple of buttons mother fucker.&nbsp; <br />Basically, is there anything I can do to get these coins?&nbsp;

				If bitcoins have been sent to an address in an encrypted wallet, and you no longer have access that wallet, then there is no way that you can get those coins. There is no means by which those coins can be transferred.<br /><br />If you have recently deleted the wallet.dat file, you could try to use recovery software to &quot;undelete&quot; it. <br /><br />

				Yeah.&nbsp; I&#039;m fucked.&nbsp; I feel like a beaten man.&nbsp; Being phished and then getting paranoid and stupid and losing bitcoins because of not writing down a passphrase and now this to top it all off.&nbsp; Sending bitcoins to a goddamn wallet that I can&#039;t even get into.&nbsp; Fucking better to wipe my ass with money I&#039;ve lost.&nbsp; I&#039;m so fucking sick of it.&nbsp; Just super pissed right now.&nbsp; Fucking hate the world right now and I&#039;m going to get high.&nbsp;

				man you have had a bad run and I hate to hear it because you sound like a good dude, I read some of your other posts especially early on when you were phished. When you get in a better frame of mind just relax and give it another run. You&#039;ve probably been through the worst already.

				Dude, that seriously sucks.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been here a little under a month, and am expecting my first orders soon.&nbsp; What I did though, was get my coins on-site with moneypak thru SumYunGai.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little more expensive, but as a first-timer, I didn&#039;t want to mess with BTC till I knew more about it.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to explore off-site BTC exchangers now, but my advice for those starting out is to get coins from a reputable SR exchanger if you want to dive right in.&nbsp; I was exited and a little impatient to start ordering right away, and SR seemed like the easiest way to get coins for me. I spent a few days looking at who had successful MP to BTC transactions, then went with SYG based on his feedback and a couple PMs to learn how it worked. I was determined to order small to start out, so I didn&#039;t mind paying a little more for coins. After my first run of purchases comes through, I&#039;ll move up and maybe look for BTC rates off-site without mark-ups.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope things start working out for you, all this can be a little overwhelming when you first discover it.&nbsp; A little part of me is still kind of expecting to not receive any packages because it seems to good to be true.&nbsp; Hopefully that doubt will be squashed this coming week.<br /><br />(also, I remember your phishing thread, when I first started reading these forums.&nbsp; I started changing my password like every time I logged out, before I even had any BTC in my account!)&nbsp;

				Thanks everybody for being so cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think what pisses me off the most is it&#039;s little mistakes that I&#039;ve made and I should have been smarter about things.&nbsp;

				Man, what a shit run of luck, sorry dude.&nbsp; <br /><br />To give some perspective, as a middle aged guy who&#039;s been out of the active drug market/scene for about ten years, the thing I think to maybe keep in mind is the drug market has ALWAYS been like this.&nbsp; I used to get fucked right and left trying to buy drugs on the street or in bars back in the day, pre internet/SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been busted, ripped off, and duped more times than I care to remember.&nbsp; Unfortunately that&#039;s kind of the nature of the beast.&nbsp; On the upside, at least in this paradigm you pretty substantially reduce the risk of getting shot or your ass kicked by some tweeker hopped up on meth or dip.&nbsp; I know that&#039;s little comfort after this string of shitty luck you&#039;ve had, but all in all I really think SR is less risky than buying in a face to face setting, especially when you&#039;re not sure exactly who you&#039;re dealing with.&nbsp; Yeah, you may get ripped off or lose money, but we&#039;ve all lost cash before when we got really fucked up and forgot what we were doing, haven&#039;t we?<br /><br />Cheers, hope your luck turns around.

				If you ever feel apprehensive about a certain transaction or method, don&#039;t hesitate to post in the forum with a description and ask if everything is kosher. There are plenty of people who&#039;d be happy to read over what you want to do and how you describe you&#039;re going to do it and say whether or not it&#039;s good. I know I will.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lost more than $100 due to mistakes I&#039;ve made while going through the process of learning about SR and setting up a vendor&#039;s account so I&#039;m more than happy to help out where I can. :)

				Take some time and read the forums. Read them as frequently as possible. Report yer experiences. You will be a pro in no time at all.<br /><br />Use Get-Bitcoin.com and Instawallet.org for easiest results.<br /><br />Check buyer feedback. Did I also mention search and read the forums? Do this fanaticaly!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I know yer already here lookin&#039; fer help, good choise, read the forums and you will learn all the standard practices.<br /><br />Good luck! You&#039;ll be cool.

				It sucks, but it happens. Just think about how much worse it could be..<br /><br />I&#039;ve lost thousands in the online market over the years.. Hopefully no longer though since finding SR.
