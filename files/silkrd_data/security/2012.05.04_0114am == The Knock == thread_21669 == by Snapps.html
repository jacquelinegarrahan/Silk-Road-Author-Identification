				Couple questions for you advanced SR users. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading up on all of this Tony stuff, and I&#039;m just wondering; how much trouble would I get in for purchasing under $40 of drugs? Would LE care, or do they focus on extreme amounts with the hardiest drugs?<br /><br />Second, should I really go out of my way and buy a VPN for when I buy Bitcoins? Even if I&#039;m still purchasing such small amounts...<br /><br />Thanks guys.&nbsp; :P

				Limitless, you just made milk sneeze out of my nose.&nbsp; Thanks.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter how much the purchase was for, its not only possession, its trafficking, among other things, if they can prove that you were the one who ordered it.&nbsp; Most people who get busted on here probably just deny everything, but, for some reason, we never see them again.&nbsp; I think they probably stay away though, you&#039;d have to be dumb to come back after getting caught.&nbsp; If you have an obvious paper trail, you&#039;re probably in a little more trouble that you can&#039;t get out of by saying you didn&#039;t order it.

				Technically they could completely ass rape you for ordering even a single bud of weed. You could be charged for money laundering, being a participant in a continuing criminal enterprise, trafficking drugs over state lines or importing drugs, conspiracy, obstruction of justice (a charge they like to throw at people who use encryption and anonymizers to avoid investigative efforts) and probably a dozen other charges, locked up and have the key thrown away. That said they are very unlikely to actually do this to people who are ordering personal use amounts, but legally nothing is preventing them from doing it, and who knows if the jury will nullify considering technically you will have broken all of those laws. It is far more likely that you will be charged by the state (not feds) with something close to equal to what you would be if you were found with those drugs after being pulled over, which could be anything from in or out patient drug rehab to a few months in jail or years in prison (which will be mostly spent on parole) for personal use amounts, depending on where exactly you live.<br /><br />People who are ordering larger than clearly personal use amounts (for example ordering sheets of acid or ounces of MDMA) are more likely to be charged with more serious offenses like drug trafficking and will likely be sentenced to several years in prison (with most on parole) instead of jail or rehab. <br /><br />People who are shipping product will almost certainly spend at least a few years in federal prison (which has no parole), and the significant vendors and organizers will probably be hit with all of the nasty charges from above and die in prison. <br /><br />They will likely charge you with slightly more serious crimes than they think they stand a strong chance of convicting you on, because they want you to plea guilty to lesser charges and they know you will not risk the chance that a jury will convict you on trumped up charges. So even if they charge you with drug trafficking for getting a bud in the mail, they will probably immediately offer you a plea bargain where you are charged with simple possession if you agree to plea guilty. The plea bargain they offer you will largely depend on how much money you have spent on a lawyer. <br />

				They will absolutely charge you with everything that you admit to.<br /><br />Last year I watched the tv show the closer and the plot of every episode was almost the same.&nbsp; They needed a confession and every time she was able to get the person to admit their crime.&nbsp; I began to realize that even on this tv show the only reason people were going to jail is that they incriminated themselves.&nbsp; Evidence takes time and money..especially the kind of forensic evidence regarding computers and encryption and pgp.&nbsp; However, if you confess to the crime they have you cold.&nbsp; Most prosecutors have conviction rates in the high 90% because they are just pleading everybody out who already confessed to their crimes.<br /><br />Judges and prosecutors hate trials. They love the confession.&nbsp; The police only want one thing from you.&nbsp; For you to say you are guilty.<br /><br />The rights should be heard like this<br />You have the right to an attorney but we are going to ask you to waive those rights.&nbsp; We are going to hint that we may go easier on you if you confess but in reality just the opposite is true.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you speak to us you are probably going to jail for a long time<br />If you refuse to talk to us you have a much better chance of either going free or getting a much lesser sentence.<br />Now.&nbsp; would you please like to explain everything.&nbsp; Talk to us.<br /><br />

				Most prosecutors have 90% conviction rates because they charge you with something that carries up to twenty five years in prison if a jury convicts you, and then they offer to lower it to something you will get probation for if you plead guilty. Judges are not bound by plea agreements, but they usually do follow through on them. Most people just are not going to risk a jury finding them guilty and getting a sentence that is twenty times worse than what they can plea bargain for, even if the original charges are trumped up. They always try to get people to plea guilty even for serious cases, go to jury you risk death penalty plea guilty get life, go to jury and get life in a shitty prison plea guilty and get eighty years in a less shitty prison etc. <br /><br />The prosecutor will almost always give you trumped up charges and then plea bargain you down to ensure a conviction.
