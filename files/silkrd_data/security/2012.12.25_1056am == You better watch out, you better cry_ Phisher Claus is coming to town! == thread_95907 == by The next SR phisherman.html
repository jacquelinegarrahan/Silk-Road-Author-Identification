				Oh man. How sad must your life be that you are more interested in trumpeting your awesome phishing skills to an anonymous mass of people rather than actually carrying out the scam? Do you have any friends and family IRL? This is not normal behavior, just so you know. I feel bad for you, honestly. Hope that this doesn&#039;t come off as being insulting or patronizing; it&#039;s Christmastime after all! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95907.msg683571#msg683571">Quote from: DPRs Mom on December 26, 2012, 06:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">......I am trained in gorilla warfare.....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hahahahahaha<br /><br />
