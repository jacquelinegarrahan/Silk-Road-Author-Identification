				Out of all the security topics here on silkroad, people seem to overlook a MAJOR one: VENDOR NAMES<br /><br />Last night, I got really stoned, and curious, and decided to do some googling. <br /><br />I found the locations, addresses, and Identities of 6 vendors in the top 20% of vendors, out of about 15 that I tried.<br />Once I got curious about one vendor, and found some info with very little effort, my curiosity grew and it was very easy to uncover the identities undoubtedly. Especially when I find their personal profile pages that have pictures with weed paraphenallia and pictures of pipes/bongs, etc. Hippy/New Age stuff etc. <br /><br />Keep in mind, a cop would be able to do this far easier than I. They have access to national databases. I used google. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to alarm anyone, but if I were a cop, which gladly I&#039;m not, this would mean some serious shit for these vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are one of the Vendors I have found, then I have PM&#039;d you and let you know that your security is at risk. <br /><br />Just because I have not PM&#039;d you, does not mean you are not also at risk. I find stoners tend to overlook obvious things sometimes. PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SAFETY, make sure you take down/change any personal pages on any forums that have any relation to your SR name. Because it&#039;s like a giant web. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t get rid of everything associated with the name, I suggest contacting SR admins and try to get a name change, if that&#039;s possible, or if it comes down to it, start a new Vendor account. It&#039;s either one of those options, or jail time.<br /><br />WHEN MAKING A SR NAME PLEASE MAKE IT UNIQUE TO SR. A single connection to anything online can lead to a million other things.<br /><br />PLEASE, TAKE PRECAUTIONS IMMEDIATELY.

I don&#039;t have time nor the inspiration to investigate the names of every vendor on SR. Many vendors probably overlooked this when creating their SR vendor account, as I have seen, and there are probably many more than the ones I googled.<br /><br />I only google 15 vendors... 6 of them I found very personal information about that was way to closely connected to their SR activity to be just some random person. Everyone needs to know about this. Vendors need to tighten their assholes or they&#039;re going to get fucked by the long dick of the law

				I have to give StonedCrusader credit for a good post... many of us don&#039;t think about the fact that we may be using a screen name that we have used multiple times on other sites or forums that could identify us. This name is my first time using it... had I used my &#039;regular&#039; ident which I have had for 15 years it probably wouldn&#039;t be hard for the Feebs to figure out who I was.<br /><br />We ARE creatures of habit... it is that habit that makes us predictable... it is that predictability that makes us easy to find...&nbsp; you MUST break from your normal routine and use all NEW info.<br /><br />Thanks StonedCrusader&nbsp; for stating the obvious.<br /><br />TJ

				You&#039;re right, it is not enough information to arrest on alone.<br /><br />But some of the stuff I found IS enough information to justify a search warrant if any previous watching was done by LE.<br /><br />For instance: LE suspects a certain person sells drugs or is getting drugs in the mail, but does not have enough evidence to act on it. They then happen to do some investigation on a Vendor and just coincidentally a person turns up who they were watching and has connections to the Vendor. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s not enough information to arrest someone on alone, but the fact of the matter is, it&#039;s information that doesn&#039;t need to be in anyones hands. <br /><br />Lets put the LE matter to the side. Think about theifs. Burglars. If I was ill-intentioned enough, I could sneak in the night and break into somebodies house and get a couple pounds of drugs and who knows what else. As a matter a fact, one of the very vendors I happen to find information about lives barley 3 hours from me, and I could become very wealthy if I went on a little quest. Lucky for them, I would never do such a thing.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter what someone uses as a vendor name. As long as they don&#039;t use something that can be directly linked to them, even if it is a vague and popular word such as &quot;PeeWee Herman&quot;. It really doesn&#039;t matter what the vendor name is. As long as it can not be tied to you in anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19297.msg194746#msg194746">Quote from: TrustusJones on April 18, 2012, 01:11 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks StonedCrusader&nbsp; for stating the obvious.<br /><br />TJ<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha, obvious things are usually is the most overlooked.

				This guy is right, they do look for common spelling mistakes and unique phrases you use in online postings to find you, also usernames. Hacker Max Butler specifically chose the name &quot;Iceman&quot; when he started the biggest crime board so they would find a dead end trying to trace the name.. been plenty of Iceman&#039;s in the carding world.

				thanks StoneCrusader, I came across a vendor a few month back and checked him on the clearnet, too. Just because I thought I saw this name somewhere. And in fact (s)he was the same.

				Good heads up for vendors AND buyers.&nbsp; It was the first thing I thought of when I was confronted by the join page--the tendency to use the same name here I use everywhere else was almost an unconscious act--luckily my paranoia in entering anything like SR kicked in.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s too easy to come up with a new log in for anyone to be that lazy . . . and put themselves at risk.

				Thanks for the post SC.&nbsp; &nbsp;I challenge u feds to google my user name.&nbsp; &nbsp;yup, saw that one coming.<br /><br />Its an especially salient point, when I am reading posts like:<br />&#039;i bought the green dot card with cash at a convenience store with no cameras, while wearing a &quot;V&quot; mask.&nbsp; Then i traded it for bitcoin through tor, while using an open router from some house on the other side of town.&nbsp; I PGP&#039;d it and used the address for the abandon house in the town next over.&nbsp; i only go to pick up late at night, and then only after circling the block several times looking for out of place cars.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I safe?&nbsp; No really am i?<br /><br />what he didn&#039;t post, but should of is that he used the user name MustangDriverNH1980 ....&nbsp; He&#039;s big under that user name all over the ford mustang forums, which he was kind enough to post to from home, and work too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course he drives one, yup he posted pictures there, and on twitter and fb.&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes he lives in new hampshire and was really born in 1980....So is he safe?
