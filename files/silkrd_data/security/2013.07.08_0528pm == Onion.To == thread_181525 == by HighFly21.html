				Onion.to is so that people can access .onion sites without having Tor installed. Right on though, probably not a good idea to access SR or anything like that from any computer or internet connection traceable to you. It&#039;s not anonymous; your ISP and hence anyone eavesdropping that traffic will easily know what you accessed.

				This has been addressed many times before.&nbsp; Onion.to is a clearnet gateway for TOR hidden services.&nbsp; It is owned by Xxor IT security company.&nbsp; They can see your username, password and all of the data when you&#039;re using it.&nbsp; Google spider crawls onion.to so pages get indexed.

				Yeah!!! ::) There are many other interesting sites on the TOR network other than SR, so having it installed opens up a hell of a lot of stuff&nbsp; (and not JUST illegal stuff)&nbsp; you just wouldn&#039;t find on the clearnet. I can&#039;t see what the need is for a site like that, it only takes 5 minutes to install!! ::)<br />Although, i admit, drugs, illegal or legal, always have a magnetic sales pull, all of their own! ;)

				i almost fell for it when i started... i was using TOR, but as others have mentioned, i forgot the SR link address so i just googled and the onion.to address was one of the first that came up. luckily i went in thinking someone might provide a phishing site so was careful about double checking the address from multiple sources.&nbsp; sure enough... i then noticed onion.to didn&#039;t seem right.<br /><br />i wonder how many bitcoins those schmucks have robbed from peoples accounts.
