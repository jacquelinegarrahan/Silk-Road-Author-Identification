				Okay so pretty much I downloaded this tool called GPG Key Chain Access and I am able to encrypt messages and whatnot and decrypt for the most part but I have no idea how to send someone an encrypted message, It feels like every program I try has a different way of doing things and I cannot find 1 guide that doesn&#039;t confuse the crap out of me.<br /><br />Can someone offer me a guide or link as to what to download, step by step etc..etc.. I will delete EVERY GPG program I have and start from scratch if I have to, this is getting very frustrating and I have people I want to do business with on SR but I can&#039;t because I have no clue how to use PGP.<br /><br />

				And if you&#039;re still struggling after that - go back to using your PC.<br /><br />I know that wasn&#039;t very helpful, but it&#039;s what I ended up doing.&nbsp; GPG Tools is a disaster.&nbsp; GPG4Win is so, so much better, plus there&#039;s some secret squirrel stuff I wanted to do that I couldn&#039;t do on a Mac.&nbsp; <br /><br />Love my Mac, though!&nbsp; Just only use it for legal shit.

				I&#039;m a mac dude myself and I finally had to give up on PGP. I just could NOT get my mail program to work with it. I fought with that shit for weeks. Thunderbird and this program and that one. I even had a high level manager at a major internet security firm come to my house and try to get it set up. He gave up after about 6 hours. That&#039;s when I knew the game was over. If the seller doesn&#039;t fuck with privnote then I don&#039;t fuck with them. Haven&#039;t had any nay sayers so far. Let me know if you get something to work for you because I do like the idea of total privacy but damn I&#039;m not trying to go insane. That crap was the reason I switched to mac in the first place.

				There is dead easy way to encrypt mails on a Mac.<br />It is a standalone piece of freeware called <br />SimplePGPEncrypt<br />and it does just that.<br />Enter text in top field, paste Public key into 2nd field and voila you get your encrpyted msg in the 3rd field from where you copy it to whereever you need it.<br />And now I think I&#039;ve earned a K+1&nbsp; :D

				Thanks for the link on that software. I&#039;m still using Lemur or wtf ever this version is called tho so I&#039;ll have to wait till I upgrade to use it. I won&#039;t work with this version. I&#039;ll prob just get a new machine before I do that, tho. These macs just keep working and working tho, so why buy a new one? Unlike my &quot;new one every 6 months&quot; PC cycle I was so happy to break with my first mac.
