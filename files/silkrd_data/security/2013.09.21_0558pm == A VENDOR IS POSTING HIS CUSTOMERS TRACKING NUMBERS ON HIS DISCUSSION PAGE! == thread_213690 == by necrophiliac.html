				OP Remove the post!<br /><br />Why would you post the numbers, and not only do that but start a thread to draw even more attention to it, your first response to someone asking you to censor the numbers was, and I&#039;m paraphrasing here but, &quot;well it&#039;s already on discussion page so this is fine&quot;<br /><br />Why would you possibly want to draw more attention.&nbsp; Contact the vendor privately, don&#039;t broadcast this shit to the world....i feel like I shouldn&#039;t even be bumping this thread.<br /><br />i&#039;m reporting to mods

				Remove the tracking numbers OP, its bad enough the vendor is listing them on his discussion page, but now you have doubled if not tripled the problem with said tracking numbers being shown in your post and a title of the thread saying &#039;come look LE some tracking numbers to track&#039;.<br /><br />Honestly i hate to say this but common sense is going out the window on SR.

				Infact yes, remove the whole post, even without you posting the tracking numbers you have just made a thread labeled &#039;LE COME LOOK TRACKING NUMBERS&#039; and then linked the place to go look.<br /><br />The discussion thread is not names &#039;tracking numbers here&#039; therefore you are putting ALOT more attention on the matter than is needed. As above poster said, you should have private messaged the vendor and contacted SR staff.<br /><br />EDIT: You even took a screen shot so if the numbers do get removed they will still forever be on the interwebs, in before LE has that anonmgur saved on there bookmark bar. Good job OP you surely are a bright spark, and the fact that you have not compromised the vendor you have only compromised the buyer. I honestly cant believe it.<br /><br />

The vendor posted it on his discussion page, and I&#039;m certain that that was an oversight on his part (with him thinking that it was &quot;secure&quot; for some ridiculous reason). Both the vendor and the OP have been given their first and only warnings about it, and to avoid any more drama that seems to be the flavor of the day lately that is all that I am going to be saying on the matter.<br /><br />Libertas

				This is why we as new vendors refuse to give tracking for the buyer,vendor and SR safety, people please think!<br /><br />Also out of all honesty anyone being sloppy should think, as the superman quote has been quoted...<br /><br />or as DPR has put it , read the knowledge folks....<br /><br />we have heard some stories of a buyer tracking a package that was caught, it can tie to ip..so for your safety,vendors and sr....NO TRACKING INFO public or displayed or messaged.

The rules apply to all vendors regardless of their position or rank. Regarding &quot;FE scams&quot;, they can be very hard to prove and we do not take action without solid evidence. When a buyer finalizes their order they are stating to the order system that it has been received, they are fully satisfied with it and the order is complete. That is why we cannot offer assistance to buyers that FE. Those buyers must also contact SR Support if they feel that they have been scammed. We look into all reports of scamming behavior by vendors.<br /><br />On the flip side, however, I&#039;m sure that as a vendor you wouldn&#039;t want a system in place whereby one or two reports of you FE scamming resulted in your demotion. We cannot demote without solid evidence, and that solid evidence can be hard to find when a vendor is accused of FE scamming. If buyers followed the advice in the Buyer&#039;s Guide, the Wiki, DPR&#039;s welcome message and the forums to stay escrow there wouldn&#039;t be any FE scams - with that in mind, your little &quot;buyer safety doesn&#039;t mean anything if much money is being made for SR&quot; comment is ridiculous and entirely unwarranted.<br /><br />Libertas

I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s me, someone I hate, my favorite vendor, the biggest vendor on here or just a nobody. Security breach that puts someone in danger = get the fuck out. It shouldn&#039;t happen, what so ever. Basically zero tolerance policies on security breaches, that&#039;s the only way to stop them from happening. When you know if you leak shit or do something stupid you&#039;re gone, shit like this just doesn&#039;t happen.

				my question is what does op have to say for themselves? imo this shit should be insta-ban so you can start a presedent and make sure this shit just doesn&#039;t happen in the future. This may be only a minor security breach but with the level of risk we work with I think it&#039;s worth it to be sever in punishment.

				This just blows me away that people are this dumb. A tracking number gives FE literally everything they need to fuck you over. Now, granted, I don&#039;t think tracking numbers on SR are a bad thing. I think vendors should use them to avoid being scammed, and I&#039;m always VERY pleased to receive a tracking number myself, so I can check on the status of my order (because I&#039;m an impatient little fuck) xD. The numbers themselves aren&#039;t the problem, it&#039;s the fucking retards like the vendor and the OP that make stupid mistakes like this. If you get a tracking #, DON&#039;T use Tor to check it, DON&#039;T show anyone, and for Christ&#039;s sake, just be smart.<br /><br />Remember guys, guns don&#039;t kill people, people kill people.<br />

				Holy Shit... you gotta be kiddin&#039; me.<br />Seller is a fool. I can&#039;t believe a top 3% vendor would be so reckless, and I have a hard time believing that they didn&#039;t know better.<br />But OP is a complete and utter retard! Really?! Just post it right there at the top of your thread? Sure, why not... they say it pays to advertise. Can you really be this stupid?<br />This whole mess is the OP&#039;s fault. Had forum member &#039;ifuckdeadpeople&#039; just messaged the vendor and administrator the chances of LE ever seeing this would&#039;ve been very low. Now it&#039;s almost certain. What a total moron.<br /><br />I hope that the buyers in question have been notified about their situation. They may want to prepare for the worst, especially if they ordered larger quantities. Yikes.<br />As stated, the vendor should have known better (the Discussion Page is secure?)... but no one would have noticed had it not been for the empty-headed OP that screamed it for the whole world to hear. God, that just pisses me off.
