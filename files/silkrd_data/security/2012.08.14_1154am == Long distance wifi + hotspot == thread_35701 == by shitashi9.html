				Here is an idea I had for enhancing your anonymity beyond Tor.<br /><br />1. Rent an office in a tall building.<br />2. Set up a parabolic wifi antenna + wifi amplifier of the type found here: http://www.radiolabs.com/products/wireless/wireless.html <br />3. Purchase pre-paid credit with a wifi hotspot provider, for cash. Needless to say, always purchase the voucher in a shop/newsstand far away from your office, and never in the same shop.<br />4. Point the wifi antenna at a hotspot approx. 1-2 km away.<br />5. Start tor hidden service.<br />6. Switch hotspot every 2 weeks or so.<br /><br />Would this be feasible? How hard would it be to find the hidden service provider once the attacker has breached the Tor layer and knows the hotspot IP address?

				Rent an office in a tall building ??? - well can be quite costly and your physical presence will require on location. why not to rent 2-3 VPS and rout to TOR through it. Hell of a&nbsp; security:&nbsp; VPS in Russia, then VPS in Venesuella, and get out from VPS in Malaysia into TOR.

				The idea is to have a layer of physical anonymity on top of virtual anonymity. VPS are not a bad idea, but it&#039;s just more of the same type of anonymity. If someone has the resources to find you behind Tor, they certainly have the resources to find you behind a chain of VPS. <br /><br />To break your physical anonymity on the other hand requires different tools and people with different skills.<br /><br />Yes, renting an office is expensive, but if you are going to run a tor hidden service, it&#039;s a bad idea to do it from your home, so you&#039;re going to need to rent an office anyhow.&nbsp; Running the web server itself on a VPS is also a bad idea, because the people working for the VPS provider can then see all your data.

				you can look into equipment used by ISPs, like tp link repeater, cost $50 only,&nbsp; it can work on batteries for long time too and can provide fantastic distance. then you can make a bridge from free or hacked AP to your location. from security point of view it is clearly overdone. phisical location if ever compromised, perhaps will be due to someone reported suspiciously behaving guys installing wifi repeaters. treat is never abstract, it is concrete, so security measures never should be abstract too.
