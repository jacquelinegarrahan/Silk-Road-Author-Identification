				In 2011 Michael Reed, one of Tor&#039;s creators, joined a tor-talk discussion and answered this very question. It was later posted to Cryptome with the title, &quot;TOR Made for US Govt Open Source Spying.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Why would any govt create something their enemies can easily use against<br />&nbsp;them, then continue funding it once they know it helps the enemy, if a govt<br />has absolutely no control over it?<br /><br /><br />Because it helps the government as well. An anonymity network that<br />only the US government uses is fairly useless. One that everyone uses<br />&nbsp;is much more useful, and if your enemies use it as well that&#039;s very<br />good, because then they can&#039;t cut off access without undoing their own<br />work.<br /><br />BINGO, we have a winner!&nbsp; The original *QUESTION* posed that led to the<br />invention of Onion Routing was, &quot;Can we build a system that allows for<br />bi-directional communications over the Internet where the source and<br />destination cannot be determined by a mid-point?&quot;&nbsp; The *PURPOSE* was for<br />DoD / Intelligence usage (open source intelligence gathering, covering<br />of forward deployed assets, whatever).&nbsp; Not helping dissidents in<br />repressive countries.&nbsp; Not assisting criminals in covering their<br />electronic tracks.&nbsp; Not helping bit-torrent users avoid MPAA/RIAA<br />prosecution.&nbsp; Not giving a 10 year old a way to bypass an anti-porn<br />filter.&nbsp; Of course, we knew those would be other unavoidable uses for<br />the technology, but that was immaterial to the problem at hand we were<br />trying to solve (and if those uses were going to give us more cover<br />traffic to better hide what we wanted to use the network for, all the<br />better...I once told a flag officer that much to his chagrin).&nbsp; I should<br />know, I was the recipient of that question from David, and Paul was<br />brought into the mix a few days later after I had sketched out a basic<br />(flawed) design for the original Onion Routing.<br /><br />The short answer to your question of &quot;Why would the government do this?&quot;<br />is because it is in the best interests of some parts of the government<br />to have this capability...&nbsp; Now enough of the conspiracy theories...<br /><br />-Michael Reed<br /><br /><br />You can read it here: http://cryptome.org/0003/tor-spy.htm<br />

				In other words, everything else is justifiable collateral damage, from their perspective.<br /><br />Paul Syverson, the other co-creator of onion routing, pops onto that list every few months to address the latest person who finds out that Tor was funded by the US military -- and goes into panic mode.<br /><br />He says the same thing. A communications network that only the CIA uses is useless. Anyone chatting through the network must be a CIA agent. But if everyone uses, then it&#039;s deniable who you are. My ISP can see that I use Tor, but am I druggie, a pedo, a corporate whistle blower, an intelligence agent? They are like the entry guard. They know who I am but not what I&#039;m doing.<br />

This means running php forums etc on Freenet is impossible. However I do think a site like SR could operate on Freenet, it would just need to use custom client side software designed to work with Freenet.

It definitely puts a lot of restrictions on service providers that Tor does not. But for somebody publishing a .pdf for example, Freenet is probably even better than Tor for the publisher. Freenet also has the advantage of being essentially immune to DDoS attacks knocking services offline. It also has the nice benefit of not requiring somebody to configure a server, or own a server, to publish content. So I would say Freenet is actually much better for publishing content than Tor is, and it has advantages for service providers and publishers in the form of resiliency, but Tor gives much more control and ease of use to people who provide services and is definitely better for service providers. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, everything has to be moved to the client.

				One way to look at it is that Freenet and Tor start from different bases. Tor is based on anonymizing services and access to services, and content is published on top of the services. Freenet is based on anonymizing content publishing and access to published content, and the services are built on top of the published content.

There are way too many groups to conclude anything about a Tor user, if you can only watch their end.<br />

				Although, I think the biggest issue with I2P is that there&#039;s no equivalent to TorBrowser. Some consider it a feature that you can use any browser, as long as you point it at the I2P tunnel, because a lot of people like to use Chrome, but vanilla browsers are vulnerable to all kinds of privacy leaks that TBB protects against. Eepsites can induce vanilla browsers to run Flash and Java, unless you take explicit steps to disable them. There are also issues with state isolation, cross-site identifiers, disk caching, and fingerprinting a la:<br /><br />https://panopticlick.eff.org/<br /><br />If you run Google Chrome with some unique set of fonts and I run Firefox with another unique set of fonts, we are uniquely identifiable across all eepsites. Here are all the things that TorBrowser protects against, which vanilla browsers don&#039;t:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/<br /><br />TBB is patched to disable potentially dangerous JavaScript and CSS, without having to disable all JavaScript and break most web sites.<br /><br />So you can either fix all those problems yourself (and apparently some of them can&#039;t be fixed in Chrome), or you can use Tor and TBB out of the box.<br /><br />For now, I&#039;ll stick with Tor. :)<br />

On the other hand, Tor has the least routing nodes of the three major anonymity networks (Tor, I2P, Freenet). Tor has about 3,500 routing nodes, I2P and Freenet have about 20,000 routing nodes each. You get anonymity gains by having a bigger userbase as well as by having more routing nodes (in the case of I2P and Freenet clients and routing nodes have about a 1:1 ratio, for Tor the ratio has been about 400:1 .) If somebody can see Tor exit traffic, they know the traffic originated from one out of over a million possible Tor users (since more than a million people use Tor, just not at the same time). On the other hand, if they see content published to Freenet, or somebody accessing an Eepsite, that content/access came from one out of only about 20,000 users. Looking at it another way, assuming all nodes route the same amount of traffic (which they certainly do not, but for the sake of argument. In reality we would need to compare bandwidth added). an attacker who adds 1,750 nodes to Tor can see roughly 50% of the traffic routed through Tor, an attacker who adds 1,750 nodes to I2P can only see 8.75% of traffic routed. In the case of Freenet this isn&#039;t comparable though because Freenet works very differently from Tor and I2P. <br /><br />So from the start your anonymity with Tor is greater than your anonymity with I2P or Freenet, because you have a much larger set size to blend into. But from the specific perspective of an end point timing attack (by far the most worrying attack against Tor), you will be anonymous to the set size until you are deanonymized. This is really roughly speaking though because there are so many other things to take into consideration, but for the most part I think many users of Tor (especially the non-pseudonymous ones) will continue to be anonymous to the set size of users until they are deanonymized with a timing attack. Having a bigger set size to blend into at first is beneficial, but the risk of falling victim to a totally deanonymizing timing attack is also a lot higher because the number of routing nodes is a lot smaller (and therefor it is easier for an attacker to control a larger percentage of them). <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The size and diversity of the Tor crowd are big privacy-protecting features. If you run a Freenet node, there&#039;s like an 80% that you&#039;re a pedophile, but if you connect to Tor, there&#039; s maybe a 10% chance you buy drugs, a 10% chance you&#039;re a pedo, a 5% chance you&#039;re a journalist, or whistle blower, or intelligence agent, or political dissident, or just somebody who is privacy conscious, or paranoid, or curious. There are way too many groups to conclude anything about a Tor user, if you can only watch their end.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I agree entirely, Tor having so many users is a huge advantage for it. However, I2P having so many routing nodes is also an advantage for it. There is a huge chance somebody using Freenet for a prolonged period of time is involved in CP, however actually proving that is very difficult. <br /><br />Overall I definitely like Tor the most. It also has the enormous benefit of allowing traffic to exit the network. I2P is weak to an assortment of attacks that Tor is well protected from (although I2P is better protected against other attacks that Tor is not well protected from, for example internal timing attacks), Freenet is difficult to use for service providers, etc.

				Their traditional user estimating algorithm shows around 500,000 normal users + 25,000 bridge users, their beta algorithm shows about 800,000 users + 3,500 bridge users. They are not sure which is more accurate yet. It looks like Runa estimates between 300,000 and 800,000 daily users. Apparently I over estimated in saying over a million though. Their traditional way of counting users will not count a user who connects to Tor for the first time in several days and does not stay online long enough in a 24 hour period to refresh their list of Tor nodes through a directory mirror.

				A lot of 5 star posts by astor and kmfkewm! Thanks guys&nbsp; :) :) :)<br /><br />Intersection attacks and other electronic methods designed to identify particular users on Tor are potentially useful tools for LE, but they&#039;ll never lead to a conviction in a court of law unto themselves. No judge or jury would ever understand the methods involved, let alone convict on them alone. But they can sure be used to smoke out and pressure people directly. That&#039;s why it&#039;s always a good idea to use Tor over a logless, anonymous VPN so you have that extra layer of protection just in case you need it.

				Yeah. This is true. The more users on the TOR network, the more secure it is and makes it harder for assholes (the governments) to sniff out nodes.<br /><br />It&#039;s all randomized, so they need at least 30% of all the entry, mid and exit nodes to OWN some of the users that use TOR only some of the time, if they&#039;re lucky. And since the TOR network is growing increasingly, it&#039;s getting harder and harder for any single organization to posses even 30% of the tor nodes, which is awesome for us, and bad for them. ^_^

				Agreed. Just keep in mind that if LE&#039;s methods for establishing physical surveillance of you in the first place are not completely clear (and this kind of thing would be FAR from clear to a sitting judge), their whole case can collapse. Fast. This is why good lawyers are paid what they&#039;re paid.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158464.msg1126322#msg1126322">Quote from: astor on May 14, 2013, 03:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Of course, but they could lead to an investigation.
