				After the recent scare over security, I took the plunge and set up tails with a persistent volume and new PGP keys. The problem is that I was drunk when I did it. Despite my own general computer illiteracy and drunkeness, I set everything up perfectly and all is well. EXCEPT I cant remember the password I used for the email I set up in association with my PGP keys. The keys work. I encrypt and decrypt just fine. But the email associated is useless to me. So back to the question: How important is the email associated with a PGP key?

				Many vendors use fake email in their keys (like none@none.com). They aren&#039;t crucial for the keys themselves, and I doubt anyone from SR would attempt to contact you at that address.<br />Mine is still a TorMail address (since it was considered secure when I created the key). I don&#039;t plan on changing the Key (no need), and I&#039;ll never log back into my TorMail account either.

				It&#039;s not a huge deal unless you sent a lot of clear text email with sensitive info using that account, then you should make a new key to avoid attention to that account.<br /><br />Myself, I registered a tormail.org account and used it for PGP key registration , but I never used it for anything. It was only to keep in contact in the event SR went down....so I have no worries.<br /><br />If you had sensitive data on the email that is registered with your PGP key...than make a new one. I suggest 4096 bit instead of 2048 bit now a days...you can never be too careful!

				Thanks for the responses. I just wasn&#039;t sure if I would need to change the keys or not. I created the email only for the keys. No sensitive info.

You might as well add another id to the key, deleting the one associated with the email while you&#039;re at it, then saving the key and exporting it to whatever software you see fit. The thing is, this procedure alters the public key ever so slightly, so it&#039;s *kind* of like generating a new one. <br />Edit or generate a new one. Your choice :)<br /><br />Zen Garden

So back to the question: How important is the email associated with a PGP key?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />At the risk of lecturing you, one of the primary rules of security is to never use the computer, unless you are stone cold sober, well-rested, and able to focus completely on the task at hand (i.e. not distracted). It is precisely at times when you are tired, drunk/high or distracted that mistakes happen. Fortunately for you, no real damage was done this time. <br /><br />As far as the email address on your PGP key goes, it is merely a type of label -- it is there for the convenience of those who would corespond with you. It&#039;s a way of making it easier to locate someone&#039;s PGP key. Your key can be edited so as to remove the now-defunct email address. You can add another one. <br /><br />To edit a key in Tails, you merely have to open a terminal window (click on the little black square on the top menu bar). <br /><br />Once the terminal window opens, key in the following commands: <br /><br />gpg --edit-key joe@blow.org where joe@blow.org is replaced with the email address that you used. <br /><br />You will then want to use the adduid command, which will allow you to add a new user-id. <br /><br />After this is done, the old and new addresses will be shown, one with a 1 beside it, and the othe with a 2 beside it. <br /><br />Choose the number (1 or 2) corresponding to the user-id you want to remove. An asterisk will appear beside it to indicate it has been selected. <br /><br />You can then use the deluid command to delete the old user-id. <br /><br />Type in the save command at the prompt, and then type in quit. Restart gpg and you will see your changes reflected in your key. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MIT clearnet keryserver<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />
