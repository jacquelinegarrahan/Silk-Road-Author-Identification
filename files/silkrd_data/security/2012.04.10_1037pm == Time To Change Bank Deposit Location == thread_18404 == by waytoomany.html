				So I went to the bank the other day to do a bitinstant cash deposit... When I walked up to the teller, another one of her co-workers came up behind her and gave her a little piece of paper(assuming it was a note). At that point I asked for an out of state bank deposit slip just like normal...<br /><br />Everything went normal except this time she asked me to give her my bank card. I told her I had a card for a different bank and wasn&#039;t in my possession at the moment. So we finish up the order and it takes a lot longer than it has in the past. She was typing something on her computer or looking something up.<br /><br />I know this seems paranoid but, why would she ask for my bank card in the first place? This is the same bank i&#039;ve used the previous 3 times and pretty sure the same lady.. you would think that she&#039;d know the routine by now. Clearly she asked for my bank card for a reason and after telling her &quot;no&quot; she sort of just continued on...<br /><br />I think she wanted my bank card in order to get my identification... should I be worried? I&#039;m also wondering why it took her soo much longer to complete this transaction than last time. Definitely not going back to that bank, I think they&#039;re onto me.

				Bitcoins aren&#039;t Illegal (yet), but is it your personal bank? Have you ever heard the expression &quot;Don&#039;t shit where you eat&quot;? If you are paranoid about the teller at that bank, don&#039;t use it anymore.

				Yeah when I have done bank deposits for bitcoin purchases I have already gone to two different banks.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking for my next deposit I&#039;m gonna go across town to a different one just to keep it fresh.&nbsp; The first time I deposited money I was kind of sketched out by the whole thing.&nbsp; But they did it fairly quickly and didn&#039;t ask any stupid questions like &quot;Can I see your bank card?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />To me, that definitely sounds like she&#039;s on to you (or somebody is).&nbsp; Why would someone walk up to her and hand her something then ask you for your bank card?&nbsp; Just doesn&#039;t sound right.&nbsp;

People often vaguely remember faces.. and they do recognize (often subconsciously) when the person across the counter has &quot;done this before&quot;. Under the circumstances (typical cashier training, maybe you are a familiar face, you act like someone who has been there before and knows what to ask for) it would be slightly odd if she DIDN&#039;T ask you for your bank card.<br />&nbsp; Simply put.. all of the above circumstances point to you actually being an ACCOUNT-HOLDER there at that bank. It most likely wasn&#039;t a matter of her &quot;being onto you&quot;. You are yet another face across the counter in a long line of people that teller is just trying to get done so she can go home and watch reruns of &quot;Friends&quot;. <br />&nbsp; The proper response to &quot;may I have your card?&quot; or &quot;Do you have an account with us?&quot; is &quot;I don&#039;t have an account here thanks&quot;.<br />&nbsp;Their next response will be (as it was for me) &quot;Would you be interested in opening one?&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is a part of their customer recruitment strategy and the way they train their cashiers. It is not &quot;know your customer&quot;.. it is &quot;upsell and snag your customer&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;Relax. Chill. By all means use another location since you probably looked at the lady funny when she was just trying to do her horrible soul-sucking job. Pity the woman. And next time be like &quot;I don&#039;t have an account here&quot; and smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;If they ask what the deposit is for.. I suggest you have a series of counter questions..<br />&nbsp; &quot;Well.. um.. what do you know about e-commerce? Like.. um.. say Uber-Cart used inside of a Druple shell? See I got buddies, and they are wanting to integrate some digicash API into the cart for their comic vending site...&quot; (and watch as the lady&#039;s eyes glaze over). <br /><br />&nbsp;Remember.. you are not a criminal. You are not a paranoid. You are a geek. A socially inept wallflower amusing himself playing around with e-commerce while you hope the (actually unattractive) girl at the Starbucks will in fact text you and say she wants to hang out and watch SciFi.<br /><br />&nbsp;Not a druggie. A geek. Method acting. Know your role. ;)

				I go through the banl drive-thru and don&#039;t even get to see a teller. I write the account number/name on an envelope with the amount. Send it through the vaccumm system and wait 5 minutes. If they ask what the deposit is for I will tell them out right, &quot;it is none of your business&quot;. I didn&#039;t have to show them anything, and for a deposit why should I, specially if I have the account number. All you really need to say if you are giving your friend money, making a donation, something like that.<br /><br />

				Trustcash let&#039;s you pick different banks when you checkout.. the ppl Bitinstant use for cash deposit.<br />They often ask for bank card because if you bank with them then fees are reduced. They aren&#039;t supposed to ask for ID for under $299 but often they do anyways.. it all depends on which teller you get.<br /><br />

				Use different banks and go at different times of day.<br /><br />Avoid the drive-thru - your car and license plate are visible on security tapes. Park a few blocks away and walk.

				The Mystic is here.&nbsp; &nbsp; Make these Training Issues slide like Titanium.&nbsp; When The BOA constrictor robot asks for your card, announce that you are making a deposit to someone else&#039;s account and not your own, therefore your card is irrelevant.<br /><br />BOA has serious Training Issues I have to correct them all the time.&nbsp; I teach the Manager how to run his branch better. I walk in a information zombie with all the answers.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you universal mycelium network for many answers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Lately all I can picture is&nbsp; Aliens Vs Predator the 2004 movie.&nbsp; &nbsp; Man it makes so much sense.&nbsp; I Was eatin some P.E.Cubensis and the world of StarCraft 2 came alive I understood the zerg, the protoss, even the World of WarCraft Lore made more sense, I swear my friend is 87% minotaur.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wow!!!&nbsp; Wow!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
