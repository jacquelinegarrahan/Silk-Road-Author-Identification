				I should add that both MtGox and intersango are no longer possible for UK users. I have an outstanding order for bitcoins off seller &#039;purogkush&#039; but I think I may have been done over. I paid up front 3 days ago and so far nothing.

				Dont know what&#039;s happening with POK as has always come through before.<br />Have a look at Bitinstant - it looks like a possibility I&#039;m considering using it soon as haven&#039;t much left.<br />There&#039;s quite a bit about it on the forums, have a look.<br />

				LO,&nbsp; if I had to explain you wouldn&#039;t understand is all I can reply...... get a clue as to the glue that keeps this site viable.If you cant figure out BTC then this site is not for you. If you want to learn then search or just browse as right now there are recent active threads with all the information you would need<br />

Can&#039;t remember the specifics, but hopefully its similar to the US method of cash deposits.<br /><br />Keep Watching.

				Bitcoins ARE the weakest part of Silk Road.<br />There was a study published suggesting that governments should try to destabilise BTC in an attempt to bring down silk road.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and find the link. Makes for interesting reading.<br />here: hxxp://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.7139v1.pdf

				I have to agree with grahamgreene, bitcoins are the foundation upon which sites like Silk Road can make the purchase of things like drugs, pornography, books etc possible. All this talk about governments trying to destabilize bitcoins is just that - talk. By its very design, it can not be manipulated by governments, that is the beauty of it&nbsp; :) Don&#039;t be fooled by all the misinformation that is coming from those that seek to undermine it because they fear the fact that they cannot control it. The possible exception to this is someone like Mt.Gox, who might be able to temporarily change the exchange rate, but it would not last for long, the bitcoin value would soon adjust itself. People need to understand more about how bitcoins work before jumping to conclusions.

				This has been covered in another thread:-<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46692.0<br />If you are not worried about anonymity, try Instawire:<br />https://instawire.org<br />No need to sign up, it has a fixed exchange rate for the day (higher than Mt.Gox average but not by much) and once they have received your banks euro deposit, takes about 4 - 6 hours (usually 5&nbsp; :) )to get the bitcoins in the wallet of your choice.<br />Bank transfer fees are currently £9.0 for Halifax, Bank of Scotland, and £15.00 for Barclays.
