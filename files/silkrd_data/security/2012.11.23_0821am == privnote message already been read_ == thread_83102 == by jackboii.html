				is it normal or is it a error/bug with privnote that when you send a message to someone it has already been read? i am not the only person this happens to and its happened more than once, just wondering if this is just a bug with the site or is it something serious to be concrened about. ive had it happen once before and then just sent the message again through priv and everything was fine, someone please get back to me asap, because this happened right before the login stopped working yesterday.<br />

				Honestly just think its a glitch with privnote, I have had it happen a couple times with me and a couple times with other people, and then other times when I read a note it comes up scrambled, pretty much encrypted, just a bug, I hope&nbsp; :o

				i second that emotion, privnote is not secure and you really should stop using it if security is a priority. learn to use pgp, it isn&#039;t hard if you follow the pgp forums... surely it&#039;s worth a few hours to prevent you going into the clink?
