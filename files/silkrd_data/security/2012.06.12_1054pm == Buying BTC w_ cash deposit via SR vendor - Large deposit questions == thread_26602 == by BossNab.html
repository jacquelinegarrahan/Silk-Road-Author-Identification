				Use a multitude of techniques to get your coin in.<br /><br />I.E.<br /><br />Hit 3 banks using bitinstant for different amounts, with different tormails. Clean them if you&#039;re a particularly careful fellow. I think you should do so with bitinstant atm honestly since their service is getting big and I bet they&#039;re a little heated with LE right now. I&#039;m just going with my gut on this one ofc.<br /><br />Then hit a bunch of different walmarts for MPs. Use trusted exchangers for this. I recommend Sugar Mama. <br /><br />Then, you can also use Western Union for amounts less than 1000 again.<br /><br />Another exchanger to look at right now is BlueSkyTraders. He did 1300 in one deposit for me yesterday.<br /><br />That&#039;s the most I&#039;ve ever done via a bank deposit. BST hasn&#039;t been around too long though so it&#039;s up to you if you really wanna risk all that dough in one transaction.<br /><br />Something I&#039;ve learned here, is that when dealing with the Road, you&#039;re better off spreading all your shit out. Whether it&#039;s using 10 different exchanges to get 10,000 on here or sending a kilo to 20 different spots.... Yea it&#039;s more work, and yea it&#039;s more hassle... But it&#039;s the safer way to get shit done.

				Crooked hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />I have one thing to add: If you do use bitinstant, make sure you use the cash bank deposit &gt; coinapult method. Everything can be done on TOR by using a tormail(s), and you don&#039;t have to mess with mtgox. Coinapult buys your coins at the current market rate and charges a 1% fee. Bitinstant 4.5% fee + 1% coinapult fee = only 5.5% in fees. <br /><br />I like this method because its almost twice as cheap as using SR BTC vendors.

				As a Bitcoin trader I can tell you for nothing that using cash and going to a trader is the safest option!<br /><br />However if you&#039;d rather use Bitinstant I would do as Crooked&#039;s suggested and make multiple smaller deposits via different banks - if the commission is 5% for two lots of USD 500 then it will be less than the 7% required for USD 1,000 after all!<br /><br />I would recommend sending your BTC to Bitcoinfog - if you&#039;re feeling ultra paranoid create a new SR account and withdraw your funds from there to your real account too so they&#039;re run through SR&#039;s mixer as well.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

The SR coin mixer isn&#039;t as effective as Bitcoinfog&#039;s but will still hugely increase your safety.

I charge $0 fees and I give you the 24hour SR average for BTC. <br /><br />I cover all fees. <br /><br />So if you buy BTC from me you get dollar for dollar in&nbsp; BTC. You can read my listings to get all the info you need. My service takes no longer then 60 minutes for you to have&nbsp; BTC in your account. <br /><br />From what my customers tell me and what I have read on here... there are some vendors that take a whole day or longer for them to send you your coin. That is crazy and you should never have to wait that long.<br /><br />My feedback speaks for it&#039;s self. I have read all kinds of threads and post about the nightmare&#039;s some people go through to get BTC. It seems couple day&#039;s there is a thread about how someone got scammed trying to buy BTC. And every time the person that got scammed makes the post to tell us about it...and they went with a vendor that had very little if any feedback or was a brand new vendor. I still can&#039;t believe people try and get BTC from a vendor with no feedback.<br /><br />Just take your time and read the feedback&#039;s from the BTC vendor you choose. Send the vendor any concerns or questions you have before you make a purchase.Find out how long it will take for you to get your coin. If the vendor does not answer your questions in a timely manor or tells you it will take a day or two to get your coin....move on and find another vendor.<br /><br />Buying BTC is very easy and fast....if you know where to go. There are plenty of good/great BTC vendors. Take a little time and do research.<br /><br />Good luck~ <br /><br />RxKing<br /><br />If you have any BTC questions, just send me a message on SR and I will try and answer them and help you. Even if you don&#039;t purchase from me:)
