				Hi<br /><br />&#039;m hoping someone can help with some problems I&#039;m having sending a GPG message to another SR user. I have tried encrypting my message with 2 different versions of GPG but the recipient can&#039;t derypt it.<br /><br />The recipient is using Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.19 (Darwin)<br /><br />I normally use tails linux and have tried twice encrypting and sending a message using Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux). I encrypt to my own public key and the recipients public key. The recipient gets an error stating &quot;no public key when decrypting&quot;. I never sent the recipient MY public key as I don&#039;t think they need it to decrypt messages that have been encrypted using their public key - am I right?<br /><br />As I had trouble with the above I also tried encrypting the same message to both public keys using Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32). The recipient still cannot decrypt but gets a different error message stating &quot;no secret key&quot;. This time I did send my public key and it was successfully imported. <br /><br />I&#039;m completely confused as people don&#039;t normally have trouble decrypting messages from me and the recipient doesn&#039;t normally have problems either. Has anyone got any idea what&#039;s going wrong and how we can fix it? <br /><br />I&#039;d be very grateful for any input.<br /><br />Cheers<br />mrbump
