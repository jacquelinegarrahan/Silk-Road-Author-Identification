			<dd class="postbody">
				So I&#039;ve had a bunch of btc on my account for a while, and then I quit drugs so they have only been sitting. And now for personal reasons I&#039;m going to be quitting again. <br /><br />So my question is, am I allowed to sell / trade btc on tbe forums or something without a vendor account? Cause I mean obviously I could use one of the vendors that sell dollars through mail but then I&#039;d be losing a huge chunk, and I imagine I could easily sell my bitcoins to other people for slightly under the mtgox average and get almost all of the money back.<br /><br />Any thoughts or anything?

				You can transfer your bitcoins out of your SR account to any bitcoin wallet of your choice from there you can easily sell them and transfer the money to a bank account , or get pre-paid credit cards or somthing.

Then withdraw the USD as PayPal to your bank account.

				What bullshit, the bitcoin seller should have to send his coins to the SR system first, they verify they ACTUALLY HAVE THE COINS and then tell the other party to send money. If the bitcoin seller get&#039;s nothing he should get the coins back. That&#039;s how real escrow works. LOL SR CMON NOW EXCHANGEZONE.COM CAN DO IT SO CAN UUU

				Oh, I just realized that from reading your tech support post. Lollol<br />Keep writing support until they fix it, internal issue and they&#039;re just sending you a form email thinking some sort of scam happened.<br /><br />Prob a large transfer is held until manual release because of security, hot wallet only keeps so many coins, so whenever an admin is up tomorrow they should send the btc

				This is not a scam on the sender&#039;s part. I know because the exact same thing happened to me last month. I&#039;m a vendor and I routinely transfer the coins from my vendor acct to my buyer acct. Last month, I transferred $400.00 worth of coin to my buyer acct. My seller account history shows the transaction occurred but my buyer account never received the coins! I waited a day, then 2 days then I finally wrote to SR Support. They hastily replied with the copy of my transaction history report from my seller account and said &quot;all looks like it went through ok&quot;....I retorted &quot;but take a look at my buyer (recipient) account, no coins made it to the account!&quot; After 2 day wait, Support wrote and said &quot;you are absolutely correct, I will notify DPR to check into this and have your coins sent&quot; About an hour later the coins showed up in my buyer account.<br /><br />So now I hold my breath every time I transfer coins from one account to another. Last night it took over 20 minutes for them to register in my buyer account after another transfer. Usually it&#039;s instantaneous. I have a feeling this happens more than people think, or know. Some of the high volume vendors may not even notice an occasional no-show of coins from one account to another. So don&#039;t say that it&#039;s definitely a scam or a Photoshopped screen shot by the sender. It happened to me. The coins left one account and somehow got &quot;held up&quot; in the transfer or outright disappeared. I believe that the sender did actually send the coins, just like I sent mine, but luckily for me, SR Support rectified it and put the coins in my account albeit after nearly a week.<br /><br />

This would take longer because of the confirmations needed , but at least you would be able to follow the coins on the blockchain.

I like to think some people in this world just don&#039;t understand how badly their poor, deceitful choices can hurt others. <br /><br />But anyway, as far as selling btc to legitimate sources, I highly recommend bitcopia.com. I&#039;ve done 5 very large transactions (they won&#039;t let you do more than $999) with them now, and it always goes smoothly. Fastcash4bitcoins has similar rates but now you have to register to use their service and they don&#039;t offer cash in the mail. <br /><br />I hope your daughter has a nice Christmas&nbsp; :)

				In the future:<br /><br />Wait until you actually receive coins, and full confirmations, then send your payment. You are the trusted vendor with history, they are unknown potential scammers. <br /><br />If you send MP early, you can phone MP and cancel the moneypak codes (this is why dealing with MP is dangerous, I can buy your coins then just cancel the codes after I get the coins). <br /><br />You could try to go get a crowdsourcing loan https://btcjam.com/&nbsp; to raise the money back at high interest or apply on the bitcointalk.org lending forum if you have wot rating on #bitcoin-otc channel.
