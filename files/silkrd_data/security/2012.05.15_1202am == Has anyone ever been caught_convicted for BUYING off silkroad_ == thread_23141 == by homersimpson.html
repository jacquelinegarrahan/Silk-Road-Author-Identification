				A parcel with your name on it is not sufficient evidence to tie the contents to you.&nbsp; For bigger packages, LE might attempt a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;, which is basically getting cops to deliver the drugs to you, then busting you shortly afterwards, but I would imagine this would be too costly to bother with for small orders.<br /><br />If you have quite a few packages seized, you may eventually get a &quot;knock and talk&quot; or something, but other than that, you should be fine.

				<br />I&#039;m sure this is a noob question, but it seems to be that when ordering off SR (as a buyer only), infrequently and only spending small amounts of money (like under $100), that using tor, storing sensitive information on a flash drive, encrypting it with truecrypt (or both), and using GPG is enough to stay secure.<br /><br />Also, going the bank deposit to mtgox (or other) via bitinstant (or similar method), then transferring bitcoins around to several instawallets before sending to SR is enough to avoid attracting too much attention, especially when the dollar amounts are very low.<br /><br />It just doesn&#039;t seem like LE would come busting my door down over an 8th of weed or a few pills.<br /><br />I have read through the polyfont page but much of that information seems excessive for a small time buyer.<br /><br /><br />Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong and offer suggestions

				No, not yet anyway, that I&#039;ve heard of.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t jump from there to thinking it&#039;s legal.&nbsp; It&#039;s not legal.

				If your smart and read the forums and security the chances of getting caught ate next to none because anyone could send drugs in your name to your address. They have to prove you did it which is very hard if your smart with your security. <br /><br />1. Always use your real name and don&#039;t use vacant homes the post office knows when a house&nbsp; Has not gotten mail for months then all of a sudden mail comes with a different name. They also know who gets mail where. So always use a real name and address. You still have plausible deniability, anyone could of sent that.<br /><br />2. Always use GPG learn it use it love it, use never know what could happen if silkroad servers are taken or accessed you want your address and name unreadable.<br /><br />3.one use truecrypt to encrypt your hard drive, then Never that hard drive or windows for silkroad if you already have delect everything silkroad related and use a free file shredder to DoD wipe the free space. Second use tails or liberte it&#039;s a secure operating system that uses ram then erases ram leaving no trace behind. Three buy bitcoins anonymously ( try the venders on silkroad under money). Also try and keep any data off any os including liberte, if you can keep it on a back up site in say Switzerland. Last but not least try to use someone else&#039;s network like hack into next doors or use a open network. Be smart if you go to Starbucks back sure your not on camera.<br /><br />4. Never talk to cops and don&#039;t even say I don&#039;t know what your taking about. The only thing out of your mouth sould be lawyer

				Frankly buddy I just had a quick look at the Polyfont page during my lunch break and I thought the very simple layout and lucid explanations was ideal for people new to Tor &amp; GPG.<br /><br />Having said that a flash drive encrypted with Truecrypt is an excellent place to store your Tor Browser and GPG software.<br /><br />One suggestion to increase your security a little more would be to use Truecrypt to encrypt your entire hard drive too using a different password to your USB key - you can then use it to generate a &quot;keyfile&quot; to be used in conjunction with a password to access your USB drive.<br /><br />This sounds a bit involved but is actually extremely easy and massively increases your security if you lose the USB stick and/or your computer. Feel free to ask if you need help setting this up.<br /><br />Re: sending Bitcoins, although sending coins to multiple wallets does slightly increase your security, in the nature of things coins must be sent from the same address at which they&#039;re received. As such, it&#039;s possible to trace purchases of coins throughout the block chain.<br /><br />If you must use traceable methods like MtGox to purchase your coins, I&#039;d suggest you run them through a mixing service like Bitcoinfog. <br /><br />The only two safe ways to obtain Bitcoins are buying the anonymously for cash or exchanging them for goods/services e.g by selling via SR.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23141.msg241256#msg241256">Quote from: Sharp on May 15, 2012, 03:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I&#039;m sure this is a noob question, but it seems to be that when ordering off SR (as a buyer only), infrequently and only spending small amounts of money (like under $100), that using tor, storing sensitive information on a flash drive, encrypting it with truecrypt (or both), and using GPG is enough to stay secure.<br /><br />Also, going the bank deposit to mtgox (or other) via bitinstant (or similar method), then transferring bitcoins around to several instawallets before sending to SR is enough to avoid attracting too much attention, especially when the dollar amounts are very low.<br /><br />It just doesn&#039;t seem like LE would come busting my door down over an 8th of weed or a few pills.<br /><br />I have read through the polyfont page but much of that information seems excessive for a small time buyer.<br /><br /><br />Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong and offer suggestions<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				By the way to the people say &quot;TrueCrypt your entire hard drive&quot;...I personally know people who have served the mandatory 1 year in prison (in the UK) for not revealing their Truecrypt password to the police. Two of my friends now and it&#039;s becoming more common. Better make a hidden TrueCrypted operating system (hidden partition), or TrueCrypt a memory stick and keep your TOR on there.

				@vlad1m1r&nbsp; Could you point to where we could learn how to encypt an entire drive? Everything I&quot;ve read about truecrypt just talks about encrypting specific folders.

				It is true that you can be forced to hand over a decryption key to a machine in the UK through RIPA legislation. Nevertheless, I was suggesting this step as an additional layer of security to protect the contents of a USB on an otherwise clean operating system.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important to be clear that while it&#039;s a worthy idea to install a hidden operating system using Truecrypt, doing so on a separate partition rather defeats the point of plausible deniability in encryption. You can (and should!) install a hidden OS to your main system partition while using full disk encryption. You can of course give the &quot;safe&quot; password to the authorities with no fear of recrimination.<br /><br />Update : I have just remembered from my heady days dabbling with computer forensics that the software Autopsy and its ilk will have you create an image of the suspect hard drive when analysing it, so even if you could construct a boot loader which could wipe the &quot;hidden&quot; partition I&#039;m not sure if it would do much good. - Better encrypt the whole OS with Truecrypt and have a dual OS if that&#039;s the way you want things.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23141.msg241960#msg241960">Quote from: oscarzululondon on May 15, 2012, 04:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23141.msg241947#msg241947">Quote from: PermanentlySpun on May 15, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">@vlad1m1r&nbsp; Could you point to where we could learn how to encypt an entire drive?

				Many thanks once again to the Guru for watching my back, rest assured I haven&#039;t forgotten you!<br /><br />An excellent summary of FDE via Truecrypt, if I may just pick up on a question PermanentlySpun ask.<br /><br />Heidi&#039;s Eraser (http://eraser.heidi.ie/) does allow you to wipe the free space on a magnetic hard drive to DoD standards (I think it&#039;s 3 or 7 passes perhaps someone can confirm?) There is also the Gutmann method which overwrites deleted data no less than 35 times.<br /><br />As Guru says however, Truecrypt can encrypt your Operating System in place. Any free space on your hard drive would be filled with random &quot;chaff&quot; data which is indistinguishable from the encrypted data when the drive isn&#039;t mounted. As such using data erasure tools is something of a moot point when your whole OS is encrypted.<br /><br />Some posters have also asked if they need to erase the free space on their HDD before encrypting their operating system using Truecrypt. It won&#039;t do any harm but there&#039;s no need. Whatever fragments of deleted files are left will be written over - I have only dabbled in digital forensics but have yet to hear of deleted files being covered post FDE in this way - perhaps once again our more technically minded users can confirm?<br /><br />If you have one of the newer Solid State Drives (as I do!) you&#039;ll find most traditional erasure methods won&#039;t work and full disk encryption if not set up properly can reduce the life of the drive, but I have an excellent tutorial on how to lessen this problem, feel free to send me a message.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23141.msg243923#msg243923">Quote from: Guru on May 16, 2012, 07:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23141.msg241947#msg241947">Quote from: PermanentlySpun on May 15, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">@vlad1m1r&nbsp; Could you point to where we could learn how to encypt an entire drive? Everything I&quot;ve read about truecrypt just talks about encrypting specific folders. Also, there doesnt seem to be a reliable way to DoD wipe unused space without wiping entire drives. I see people mention this all the time on the forums, but when actually digging into it every tutorial just explains how to wipe entire drives.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />See: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=system-encryption<br /><br />System Encryption<br /><br />TrueCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, i.e. a partition or drive where Windows is installed and from which it boots.<br /><br />System encryption provides the highest level of security and privacy, because all files, including any temporary files that Windows and applications create on the system partition (typically, without your knowledge or consent), hibernation files, swap files, etc., are always permanently encrypted (even when power supply is suddenly interrupted). Windows also records large amounts of potentially sensitive data, such as the names and locations of files you open, applications you run, etc. All such log files and registry entries are always permanently encrypted too.<br /><br />System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct password each time before Windows boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by the TrueCrypt Boot Loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive and on the TrueCrypt Rescue Disk.<br /><br />Note that TrueCrypt can encrypt an existing unencrypted system partition/drive in-place while the operating system is running (while the system is being encrypted, you can use your computer as usual without any restrictions). Likewise, a TrueCrypt-encrypted system partition/drive can be decrypted in-place while the operating system is running. You can interrupt the process of encryption or decryption anytime, leave the partition/drive partially unencrypted, restart or shut down the computer, and then resume the process, which will continue from the point it was stopped.<br /><br />To encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, select System &gt; Encrypt System Partition/Drive and then follow the instructions in the wizard. To decrypt a system partition/drive, select System &gt; Permanently Decrypt System Partition/Drive.<br /><br />The mode of operation used for system encryption is XTS (see the section Modes of Operation). For further technical details of system encryption, see the section Encryption Scheme in the chapter Technical Details.<br /><br />Note: By default, Windows 7 and later boot from a special small partition. The partition contains files that are required to boot the system. Windows allows only applications that have administrator privileges to write to the partition (when the system is running). TrueCrypt encrypts the partition only if you choose to encrypt the whole system drive (as opposed to choosing to encrypt only the partition where Windows is installed).<br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just to point out an alternative to everyone, You can use tinycore linux to build a Credit card sized CD that is a bootable full gui install of linux with GPG, TOR, and bitcoin installed. <br /><br />Then use the dev mapper crypto stuff to encrypt a pen drive. With out the CD it will look like it is full of garbage.

				An excellent point Kappacino,<br /><br />You can be encrypted provided that it can be demonstrated that your hard drive is indeed encrypted. This would be fairly easy for a forensic analyst if you use FDE as the Truecrypt bootloader* is installed to the same partition. You could of course encrypt the whole HDD and use a Live CD or bootable USD to access it. That way you could plausibly say your HDD has been wiped by overwriting it with random data and no one could tell the difference.<br /><br />The same applies if you encrypt an entire external hard drive / USB key. In theory Truecrypt containers i.e TC files created on an otherwise unencrypted hard drive aren&#039;t identifiable but in practice they have &quot;perfect&quot; block symmetry so it&#039;s hard to pass them off as random data.<br /><br />It is a good point however and it actually might be worth your while to let the matter run the whole nine yards and let it come to court before revealing a password - the burden of proof is still upon the Police to show that the volume is encrypted and hasn&#039;t been wiped.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />*The bit which loads up when you first switch on your computer and asks for your password in order to access the encrypted drive.

				Here&#039;s the deal.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think that you&#039;re immune, because there is an element of risk, but for small amounts they tend to just seize the package and send a love letter.&nbsp; If the shipment is domestic than the odds of being caught are extremely low as long as the seller doesn&#039;t ship a package with odors or suspicious packaging, but it could put you at risk for a controlled delivery.<br /><br />If a controlled delivery does happen, typically the cops are will try to prove that you knew the package&#039;s contents, and they&#039;ve been known to use the fact that you opened the package as &quot;proof&quot; you ordered it.&nbsp; It&#039;s always a good idea when receiving your package to write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on it after picking it up and to avoid opening it for a day.&nbsp; That will give you some ammo for your defense.&nbsp; Also keep your home clear of other contraband if possible, and keep your hard drive encrypted.&nbsp; Give them your name and then invoke your right to remain silent.&nbsp; Do not admit guilt, and don&#039;t give them your PC&#039;s password, even if threatened by the police (police are legally allowed to lie to procure a confession).&nbsp; Demand an attorney and discuss the details with him.<br /><br />

				Using a neighbors wifi is probably not very helpful for anonymity but the chances of being raided or even talked to by police for it are extremely remote. There are very very very very few cases of people being bothered for stealing wifi and in all of the cases I have found they were working on a laptop while parked in front of the house that they were taking wifi from. Not many people have the technical skill to determine that someone unauthorized is using their wifi, even though it is often as simple as checking the routers interface and seeing the MAC address of all connected devices. Even the people who know what a MAC address is and know how to check logs from their router are not likely to do so unless they notice their internet is going slow as shit. People with open wifi or WEP are even less likely to know how to detect people stealing their wifi, if they knew this much they would probably know to not use WEP in the first place. <br /><br />Even if the person who owns the wifi AP you are using does determine that someone unauthorized is using their internet, they will not be able to determine who is doing it unless they know how to trace a wireless signal. If they call the police over it they might know how to trace it back to you though, so in theory you could get in shit for it. This never happens though.

				The reason they don&#039;t go after every single drug they find in the mail is because they still need to build a case proving that you ordered it.

Of course you may want to encrypt the hard disk anyway as a decoy.<br /><br />Something else of note is that TAILS like many flavours of Linux natively supports encrypting USB keys&nbsp; - https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html so you could use a Live DVD in combination with an encrypted USB stick to store your GPG key ring etc.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m overwhelmed at the attention this post has!!<br /><br />Yesterday I created a linux memory stick yesterday but then read this thread today and thought, I would like it to be encrypted.<br /><br />I formatted my memory stick and went through the whole partitioning and creating the hidden part etc.<br /><br />I extracted and ran liberte in the hidden part and it ran the bat file (assuming that operating system was up and running now)<br />I restarted thinking it would go through the whole process but a black screen appeared telling me to remove the usb and press any key to restart.<br /><br />Anyone know why this isn&#039;t working? It should run the setup then once the operating system is running prompt me for the password, right?<br /><br />Thanks everyone<br />

				I think that when I boot up with the USB it only sees that there is a file on it that it can&#039;t open. I need it to be able to bypass that file to let it run the operating system. What am I doing wrong?

				I don&#039;t know what the story is in different parts of the world but where I come from it is the duty of the postal service to deliver to the address not the name - the name is irrelevant. So the package will be delivered. I don&#039;t usually sign for packages (unless permitted to by the po - even then i make a note &#039;signing on behalf of so and so); then again it&#039;s human nature/curiosity to sign for a mystery package. I use a fictitious name with my real home address when ordering so-called &#039;illegal&#039; drugs (in the eyes of a bunch of self-important power mongers called the government,&nbsp; LE, FIB, etc). The worse that can happen is your order gets confiscated and you don&#039;t get arrested because you have no idea who sent it or who the name on the package is .... a practical joke, maybe a spurned lover, you have no idea, etc, wink, wink, end of story.
