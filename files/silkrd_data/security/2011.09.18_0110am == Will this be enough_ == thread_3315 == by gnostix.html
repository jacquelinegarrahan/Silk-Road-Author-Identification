JAP / HSS / Ultrasurf are all VPN&#039;s. <br />There are pluses and minuses to each, like how Ultrasurf reportedly collects data on you like your IP, which sites you went to, what you clicked, etc.<br />HSS doesn&#039;t record this information but has ads built in (that can be easily blocked with firefox addons) to pay for it since it&#039;s a great/fast free service that hides ALL internet activity on your computer, not just your web browser like Ultrasurf and JAP.<br />JAP (aka JonDo) is a java bundle with its own browser with built-in apps. It has paid service and free service, good but reportedly user limits on free servers so can get crowded and slow.<br /><br />2. InstaWallet is an eWallet (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/EWallet) available at instawallet.org<br /><br />3. Tumbler --&gt; any type of coin mixing / laundering service, potential fees or commission.

				It sounds good to me. Provided you use new bitcoin addresses each time you do anything (you generate new ones within the bitcoin client) you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />From everything I&#039;ve read one only needs to send bitcoins to https://instawallet.org and leave it there for a few hours (let&#039;s say... six) and it&#039;s been laundered. Don&#039;t waste your money on laundering services since you can do everything you need on your own.<br /><br />It sounds like you&#039;ve got everything set. :)

				Thanks for replly, jezztah.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read in the forum if you use a good VPN you can create an account in Liberty Reserve even using Tor, so I believe it would work for Mt.Gox too. Does somebody can confirm it?<br /><br />Just curious: can you mention one paid laundering service?

				I haven&#039;t used either of these services, nor do I know anybody that has. Use at your own risk.<br /><br />http://www.bitcoinlaundry.com/<br /><br />http://bitlaundry.appspot.com/
