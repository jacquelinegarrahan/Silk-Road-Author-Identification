				Anyone set this up? I am testing out vip72 socks5 and having a hell of a time getting this working. I have read literally all the info I can find on this and half of it is for linux (which I am not using) and the other half is outdated or doesn&#039;t work. Anyone have experience with this or can direct me to a recent tut on&nbsp; how to get it working for windows 7? I am using proxifier 3.21...

				It&#039;s a waste of time, and stupid on top of that.&nbsp; Exempt vidalia and tor from your vip profile, so it doesn&#039;t try to proxify your tor connection.&nbsp; Tor is a hidden service all by itself.&nbsp; Proxify your other stuff.

				If you&#039;re simply trying to hide the fact that you&#039;re using Tor from a local observer, use bridges<br /><br />https://bridges.torproject.org/<br /><br />and if you think the observer will DPI your connection, use the pluggable transports bundle.<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-pluggable-transports-bundles-02411-alpha-flashproxy-obfsproxy<br /><br />One hop proxies don&#039;t protect you from anything.

				I had to look up what vip72 is. Apparently some kind of proxy/VPN service. So I assumed he&#039;s trying to hide his Tor connection. There are easier, cheaper (free), and more effective ways to do it. :)<br />

				Yeah, I use vip72&#039;s competitor, socks escort, and it works like a dream.&nbsp; It costs money, though, so the average SR user won&#039;t need it.&nbsp; You can use it in tandem with Tor without problems, if you know how to set it up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use a bridge, but I do often wonder if that keeps my ISP in the dark about where I go on the internet.&nbsp; Not exactly where, but at least generally where.

				The idea is to chain tor with a proxy for two reasons: <br /><br />1. (as you mentioned) to hide that I am using tor and thereby not be seen as using a blacklisted IP.<br /><br />2. to also appear to be in a specific geographic region (determined by the proxy) for online gambling and other restricted activities.<br /><br />I am just testing this out and if there is a better provider than vip72 that&#039;s fine. I do, however, NEED the ability to use proxies in different locations. It does not appear that these bridges give me that ability. I will look into socks escort and see what&#039;s what.<br /><br />Maybe this is &#039;dumb&#039; or there are free ways to do it but that is what I am after. I know that it is possible to chain socks5 with tor I have just had no luck getting it to work.

				Oh I see. You can use bridges to hide your Tor use from a local observer. If exit nodes are blacklisted by the destination site, you can point TBB at any open web proxy. Usually there&#039;s a high turnover rate and new ones pop up all the time, so they are less likely to be blacklisted.<br /><br />Try some of these: http://www.publicproxyservers.com<br /><br />As an example, USA nodes start here: http://www.publicproxyservers.com/proxy/list_country7.html<br />

				For which one, bridges or web proxies?<br /><br />With web proxies you point your TBB at the proxy and enter the URL you want to visit, usually in the form on the site.<br /><br />For bridges, go to bridges.torproject.org, solve the captcha and you will be given 2 or 3 &lt;ip address&gt;:&lt;port&gt; numbers. Then go to onion icon -&gt; Settings -&gt;&nbsp; Network -&gt; My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network. Paste the first &lt;ip address&gt;:&lt;port&gt; into the field under Add a Bridge and click the plus sign to add it to the list. Then paste the second one in. That&#039;s it.<br /><br /><br />Hey vanilla. How come you have 300 posts but over 100 days logged in on the forum? That&#039;s insane. :)

				Ok I see we are talking about different things. I was after a more permanent method but this may work. I will check out this proxy website and test it to see if it will meet my needs.&nbsp; On the off chance that doesn&#039;t work for me,&nbsp; I will be back. ;)<br /><br />PS - As for my logged in time, I have been a member here since July 2011.

Those are ones that are mine so no one else can wreck them for me. Private proxy providers give a wide range of available proxies that are not banned and do not have any shenanigans associated with them. Might cost a little but I never have to worry about problems associated with my IP. But I still want the anonymity of tor as well. This is my conundrum.
