				You can try MTGox. They accept cash deposits from Barclays. It takes approx. 24 hours on average though depending on when you do the deposit as they&#039;re in a completely different time zone. (so, if you deposited today,&nbsp; you&#039;d probably find it credited in the middle of the night tonight).<br /><br />Don&#039;t access MTGox when using TOR though, it pisses them off and they&#039;ll ask for ID documents.

				So there was this service where you could get a couple of bitcoins with your mobile credit.<br /><br />So; if you find that service online:<br /><br />Then obtain a cheap mobile and top it up with credit (cash in both cases, don&#039;t register the mobile).<br />Only put in the battery (you can always recharge with your regular phone) when you&#039;re far away from your place of residence.<br /><br />Put in the battery. Send appropriate txt msg to the service. Recieve bitcoins in a wallet. Do that a couple of dozen times and you&#039;ll have a way of converting your currency into B$ without worrying about CCTV in banks or suspicious tellers.<br /><br />--<br /><br />That&#039;s only for small amounts of Bitcoin really. Your thumbs would get tired after a while.<br /><br />The other thing to do, is make a OTC transaction (that is: there are services online that find people willing to sell you Bitcoin, so you can meet up with them in person in a cafe somewhere and convert your cash to Bitcoin that way). That&#039;s good for large quantities of Bitcoin.<br /><br />--

				Supposedly you can access MtGox reasonably securely using a secure shell host from shellmix.com with the application putty. But I can&#039;t get it to work with firefox and alas, nobody will tell me how. If you figure it out do post. Dealing with them from a netcafe is probably a bad idea isnt it?

If it&#039;s a large amount contact MtGox, show them your ID if requested, get your coins then run them through a mixer like BitcoinFog. Learn from this experience and use a VPN to access MtGox in future (Shellmix is my personal favourite).<br /><br />Otherwise I suggest you cut your losses and move on. At the risk of sounding like a plug I sell BTC in exchange for Ukcash / Cash in the mail. Feel free to message me for details.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.

If you are withdrawing larger amounts though where you are going to go wrong is creating the paper trail/having reasons to be withdrawing so much. It&#039;s not hard to get round this but it can be done. PM me if you need help, I know my shit about financial shit.

				goangod - Contact them and explain that the money never appeared. I have to do this almost every time. It&#039;s usually because the bank teller didn&#039;t emphasize the reference enough (not matter how many times you tell them!).<br /><br />Email them and just say how much you deposited and which day. When I&#039;ve had to email I get quick responses from them (depending on the time of day - they are on the other side of the world) and the money goes in quickly.<br /><br />The buying of bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal. They blocked your account the first time because you used Tor - it happens, but don&#039;t stress about it. You haven&#039;t *actually* done anything illegal (yet). If you are really, really worried you could get your BitCoins and just resell them and start over (although you&#039;ll make a lose this way)<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t go that far. If you are really panicking just email them, get your BTC, get it out of MtGox, tumble it a lot and then next time set up a new MtGox account with different username, password, email, etc.

				Thank you aligibbs !<br />&nbsp;I i did some bank transfers to begin with to try and make things look as open as possible, but now after reading what you&#039;ve said. Its not needed. I&#039;ll jusr close my current mtgox account, open 4 new ones, and tumble from all 4. i do alot of traveling around the uk so i can deposit in many differant branches, wich will help :D<br /><br />Again, Thank you<br /><br />Skunky.

In addition to this as you say if you bought something the BTC would transfer to the SR seller&#039;s account and would be put through the site&#039;s mixer prior to withdrawal.<br /><br />Once again if you want the best guarantee of anonymity I would buy BTC with cash where possible but the method you&#039;re talking about is 99% safe for buying small amounts of BTC in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

I am just double checking everything before I make any school boy errors. What I am doing now is what I would call research, which is obviously the best method of doing anything. If it was possible for me to anonymously obtain bit coins without trusting potentially sketchy vendors then this is what I would have done in the first place and not gone the route I have and started asking questions.

Im not sure what intersango&#039;s policies and procedures for checking up on their users IDs. If say for instance LE was for some reason targetting you and wanting to know what your doing, they would need the co-operation of your bank and intersango to be able to trace what you have done but if your in that position its already game over.<br /><br />When you wire money to inter they give you a reference number which indicates to them its from you. If it was a personal transfer to someone you knew, there is a section where you put in some details so the person recieving the transfer knows who it is coming from but when you do it with inter you just use the reference number rather than a name.<br /><br />I hope this explains it although it seems like Ive just talked round in a circle.

Any coins they then transferred could then be followed throughout the block chain but they&#039;d have no way of knowing to whom the BTC had been transferred unless the person withdrawing them did so using a traceable method e.g to a bank account.<br /><br />This would still leave them with no evidence as to your identity as there&#039;d be no definitive proof that the person withdrawing the coins was you - indeed since most people buy BTC in order to use them to buy products like controlled drugs, this needn&#039;t even worry you - let us sellers worry about ways to withdraw our BTC safely, you&#039;re using them to buy!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

If I access MtGox through my regular browser (rather than TOR as you suggested), even when I use a fake account to sign up, won&#039;t my own PC/IP be linked immediately? <br /><br />Also, have any UK based buyers used BTinstant?

				It is possible to send money to intersango straight from your bank account, but this obviously means it is totally traceable, depends what you want to do with the money and if anonymity is a must. Its is for most people, if your desperate enough though it is technically possible.<br /><br />Looks like intersango might have sorted their withdrawal problems, or they are sorting it out, I heard some people have got their withdrawals but am not sure.

Of course there&#039;s always my cash in the mail service which is wholly untracable... :-)<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m still ok with Intersango even after they sat on my money for more than 2 weeks but this can happen when shit hits the fan, I can live with it, while I constantly look for other possibilities.<br />I don&#039;t think they realize how big they are, would definitely need more workers to run an exchange service sized like this. <br />But that brings some risks with it. more people can fuck up something or get off with some money.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">isnt that what caused some of this shit&nbsp; with inter someone selling pills on topix giving there reference and inters bank and then he bought the pills on sr but he got deleyed or turned scammer someone put his bank details up all the bitches start ringing metro sayin its a coke dealers acc<br />i dont know if this was a problem for inter just what i read<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nobody knows for sure what caused it, I&#039;m aware of that post on topix, but how would anyone know that a buyer was indeed bitching about it to Metro, then metro closed the account because that bitching, this is a little far fetched IMO.
