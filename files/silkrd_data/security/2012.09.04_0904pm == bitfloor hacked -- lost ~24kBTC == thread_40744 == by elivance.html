				Hope none of you had any coin in bitfloor.&nbsp; They were hacked and lost all their Bitcoin.&nbsp; (This is an example of why you should use off-line encrypted wallets if you have coin that you don&#039;t need in the near term.&nbsp; E.g., Armory client.)<br /><br />

				Crap, looks like a few people kept coin there.&nbsp; I fucking hate thieves.<br /><br />The only reason to keep money or coin at the exchanges is if you are a trader.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t trade, I move my money fast through those sites.<br /><br />Not that it helps you now, but here is some good advice: keep your coin in three places.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; An off-line wallet.&nbsp; (Check out the Armory client for example.)&nbsp; Use this for the majority of your funds -- basically anything you are keeping in BTC that you don&#039;t need to spend in a week.&nbsp; Use a paper backup.<br />2.&nbsp; Use a local encrypted wallet.&nbsp; Yes it is a pain in the ass to wait for the block chain to sync, who cares?&nbsp; This is the best place to keep your funds.&nbsp; (Why trust a website?)<br />3.&nbsp; SR.&nbsp; You know this is why you bought the damn coin to begin with.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; (Actually, I never leave much in SR after I purchase but I do try and leave a few coins in the account so I can do my part to keep the mixer well funded.)<br /><br />The real interesting thing to me about computer security lately is how Bitcoin is changing the game.&nbsp; I mean, put an untraceable $250k prize anywhere and you&#039;ll get some pretty ingenious attacks.

				That sucks, Bitfloor was my favorite trading site. Luckily I store all of my BTC in my Silk Road account (If it&#039;s secure enough to sell quantities of illegal drugs, then I consider it secure enough for my bitcoins too).

Do not use exchange services (or even SR) as an online bitcoin wallet. It&#039;s not. These sites generally aggregate all their funds into one big master wallet, and if that is compromised it&#039;s all game over.<br /><br />It costs you absolutely nothing to transfer your BTC out to your own machine and store it in an encrypted wallet. Or even a &quot;cold&quot; off-line one.<br /><br />

				dingowombat,<br /><br />I am sure there were others who lost as well. My problem is 24thousand bit-coins were stolen,<br />Out of that 24K - One K were mine.<br />I would say that is a considerable amount to get completely enraged about.<br />To say I want them dead is an understatement.<br />
