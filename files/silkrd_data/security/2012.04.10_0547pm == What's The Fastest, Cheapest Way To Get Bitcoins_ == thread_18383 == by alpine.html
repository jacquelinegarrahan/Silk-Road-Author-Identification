				don&#039;t know about cheapest, but blizzcoin is definitely the fastest, although every so often it has to &#039;refill&#039; but I get bitcoins in my account within ten minutes of the transaction.

				Hi brotha.<br /><br />The cheapest way i found, is AurumXChange<br /><br />https://www.aurumxchange.com/<br /><br />They have lower fee&#039;s than BitInstant, and the service is instant. Since they started doing cash deposits i have use them many times, And its been flawless every time.<br /><br />My bank is only 15 minutes away, and my money has been waiting on MTGOX by the time i get home after the deposit. Print the receipt, Make the deposit, Call the 1-800 number and confirm the deposit. and BAM! , money is instant on mtgox(or w/e service)<br /><br />Hope that helps,<br />Cheers

				I second Aurum Exchange for cash deposit.&nbsp; The fee is stupidly little, and it&#039;s extremely quick.

				Thanks, AurumXChange looks great. so how does it work? i take it i would go to AurumXChange click exchange, enter pay from us deposit and send to mt gox. then i guess they would give me a bank to go to hand them cash and put some kind of account number in the comments on the deposit slip and they would send it to mt gox? thanks

				I use get-bitcoin.com&nbsp; great website.&nbsp; the fee is only 5%&nbsp; and they allow Bank of America/Chase account deposits.&nbsp; The turn around is a few hours though..&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any bank deposit on AurumXchange.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer to not deal with wire transfers.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather just give the money at the bank and leave.&nbsp;

Gox for to (you can get either a voucher or put it directly into your account - no value difference).&nbsp; You fill out the details and select a local bank.&nbsp; Then you select a way for them to send their bank account details, and that&#039;s pretty much it!&nbsp; Just go to the bank with their account info, drop off the deposit, and walk away still anonymous!

				Get-Bitcoins just has you give them an amount, you gotta factor in the 5% difference so you don&#039;t go WTF WHERES MUH BITCOINZ.&nbsp; Then there&#039;s a drop down menu where you choose how you would like to pay them.&nbsp; I usually goto a bank and just fill out a deposit slip.&nbsp; They give you account number and account holder name and then you just hand off the money.&nbsp; They make you take a picture of the receipt for the deposit you send it in and bam... should be good within like 3-5 hours.&nbsp; It&#039;s not SUPER fast but it&#039;s not days either... <br /><br />plus if you use something like instawallet it launders the coins for you and voila, anonymity!
