				There are a few ways you can get bitcoins in new zealand;<br /><br />First you need to download a bitcoin client. You can find this at http://bitcoin.org and download it for whatever OS you are on (linux, windows, mac). Now extract the file and run the bitcoin.exe which is in the extracted folder. This will install bitcoin. Once bitcoin is installed open it up and let it synchronize with the network completely before attempting to buy bitcoins, this can take a while depending on your internet speed but I ran into seriously problems because I didn&#039;t let it synchronize before buying bitcoins (it should say down the bottom &#039;synchronizing with network block xxx xxx downloaded wait for them all to download.<br /><br />Now you have a couple options to buy bitcoins;<br /><br />1. You can use an exchanger on Silk Road. These are Silk Road users that will send bitcoins to your address for some form of payment, I think in New Zealand you probably will have to use Western Union or cash in the mail. One of the most popular exchanges with good feedback is Sugar Mama ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/aace915f06 ) send her a message about buying bitcoins in NZ, you can search for other exchangers using the search function. Note Western Union may not be ideal for anonymity as I believe you need some kind of ID whereas cash in the mail will take longer but be completely anonymous (as long as it&#039;s not intercepted by customs, but I don&#039;t think it would be.<br /><br />2. You can use an exchange like mtgox.com although this method is not anonymous as you will need to pay with your bank account, and may need to upload photo ID. Though this may not matter much if your only going to order a small amount of DMT one time for personal use, however I would advise you to be as anonymous as possible, contacting sugar mama is probably your best bet.<br /><br />I have heard of a kiwi using a visa &#039;prezzy card&#039; to buy bitcoins in an article here; ( www.newswire.co.nz/2011/12/silk/ ) though it doesn&#039;t say how he did it, if you can find info about this, this may be a better, less traceable option.<br /><br />:)<br />-dimethyltryptamine<br /><br /><br />

You&#039;ll still have to pay cash into a bank account but you won&#039;t have to show any ID. The alternative is cash in the mail but my poor nerves couldn&#039;t handle this as the last order was for NZD 5,000 and I was terrified it would get lost in the post (actually it arrived safely!)<br /><br />Please feel free to send me a message if you&#039;re interested.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				Hey New Zealanders!<br /><br />We have just listed a NZD for BTC service, via cash in the mail to Australia.<br /><br />We charge a flat fee of AUD$25, regardless of transaction size.<br /><br />Customers will have to pay AUD to BTC fees, but the day we receive the cash, is the day you will receive your Bitcoins.<br /><br />Happy to answer any questions you guys have.<br /><br />Listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/5f8554516c<br /><br />**Since we are a new vendor, we will offer the first FIVE buyers a $5 discount on the product.**<br /><br />We are also thinking of a BTC to NZD listing, if there is any demand. This listing will include one of our anonymous VISA cards, loaded with your Bitcoins. <br /><br />El Lobo<br /><br />
