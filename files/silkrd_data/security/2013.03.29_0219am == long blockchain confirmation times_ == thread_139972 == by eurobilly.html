				I sent some btc from bitinstant to instawallet today. The purchase still shows as an unconfirmed transaction in the blockchain after several hours. This usually takes about 90 minutes. Can anyone offer some insight? Thanks in advance...<br /><br />- eb 8)

				I&#039;ve had confirmations take days recently. Fortunately it was for only a few satoshis so it was more a curiosity than an inconvenience.

				Confirmations have been taking forever lately. My last two transactions in the last week have taken about an hour a confirmation. So 6 + hours to confirm my BTC. Before I have never waited more than 40 minutes.

				yeah this is annoying. i&#039;ve had this happen alot lately and sometimes it takes over 24 hrs to get 1 confirmation. is it because transaction fees aren&#039;t high enough or is it because of SR? let us set our own transaction fees if so.

				I don&#039;t think the problem is only with SR. I have noticed the same thing occurring when transferring BTC among different wallets/sites outside of SR. <br /><br />Perhaps the increased amount of transactions is causing longer confirmation times? Not totally sure though. But for me transactions from one local wallet to another has been taking 24 hours+ to even get 1 confirmation

				Throw in a higher than average transaction fee if you have the option to. It will be picked up by the miners quicker
