				@Lestweforget, you can also read about CaptainMal on the SR forums, just search his name and see what people have to say about him...<br />I often find the forums to be a lot more useful when trying to research reliability of vendors. :)

				For deposits of $500 or more I use these guys:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=87094.0<br /><br />They work exactly like BitInstant and are even more secure as they do not require any personal information and only communicate via pgp encrypted emails. I&#039;ve been using them for ~3 weeks now since BitInstant started acting funky and found them to be just as quick, trustworthy, and reliable.

				here is an idea, get an account on Dragon&#039;s Tale, through TOR (of course), play for a bit then ask other players if they will sell you BTC.&nbsp; Their servers are in costa rica and you might be able to find someone willing to sell to you via paypal even, perhaps money pack, etc.&nbsp; There are a lot of gamblers with a lot of coin.<br /><br />Hell you may not even need to use tor to login as if you mix the btc (I hear blockchain is good and at only 1.5%) you purchased then xfer to SR you &quot;should&quot; (of course that&#039;s just my observations) be safe.<br /><br />With that being said, DON&#039;T abuse this technique as I don&#039;t think the game company would be happy about massive btc sales happening on their site to go to SR.&nbsp; And definitely don&#039;t tell everyone (in game) what you are going to do with your btc!<br /><br />Then if you play the game and like it, it does give you a very good excuse to having lots of BTC, especially if you don&#039;t mine, etc.&nbsp; Who knows maybe you will win extra coin to spend here, ;)
