				Hi,<br /><br />Imagine following scenario:<br /><br />An acquaintance (whom you can trust) buys Bitcoins non-anonymously. He then holds his bitcoins for a few weeks, maybe even months, uses and sells a small to medium amount to make it look like he bought it for personal and foremost legal purposes. He then makes an account on localbitcoin.com with an offer in his city. <br /><br />This is where i come into play. I regist on localbitcoin.com and give an address which is near, but not in the city my friend is in. I then contact him with an email, making it look&nbsp; official (could be fake or might even be Tor email address).<br />We exchange mails and meeting points, maybe even names and decide to meet up.<br />Obviously the price and the amount was already agreed upon prior to the friends purchase. You then receive the bitcoins &quot;anonymously&quot; and bring them into SR. <br />Even if the Bitcoins will at some point become tracable, the friend who purchased them nonanonymously will have solid proof of the fact that he sold themm over localbitcoin and does not know who i was. therefore nobody will take blame for the purchases made.<br /><br />What do u all think?<br /><br />Greetings<br /><br />DisBandment

				Great idea up to the point where you published it on a forum, if you plan on doing this now I suggest getting a new identity.

				Would be a lot of work for LE to deal with it for just a buyer.<br />For a seller on the other hand they are more than likely to follow trails like that.<br />

				Ya if your just a small time buyer than you will be fine. No need to go through all the secrecy. Just buy them off your friend.<br /><br />If you do wanna be safe, what you have suggested really isnt being any more anonymous. If you wanna be anonymous, run the coins through a mixer like bitcoinfog or Blockchain.info&#039;s mixer. Then the coins will have no tie to you.<br /><br />

				Alright this is how you do it.<br /><br />Have your friend send the bitcoins to a blockchain.info account you made. Then look for the anonymous send button on the send category of your blockchain.info account and send the bitcoins to your SR wallet.<br /><br />It will take at least 6 hours to get from blockchain to SR because random chunks are taken at a time and mixed with other coins then sent to your SR wallet. It is also a 1.5% fee for using blockchains mixer<br /><br />Hope that helps

Why would i need a blockchain account???? From a legal perspective my &quot;friend&quot; can proof without a doubt that he sold the coins annonymously and will not be/cannot be persecuted. As long as he knows that they cannot build a plausible case against him, there would be no reason to fret over an investigation.<br /><br />This friend should not have been contacted through email or im services, his friends and family should not be able to identify you as an acquaintance etc. it is possible to find such a person.<br />By using localbitcoins he will have the proof along with the fact that there is no connection between me and my friend. Localbitcoins as such is a known way of legally trading bitcoins. Thus selling them anonymously should not really be seen as all too incriminating. Obviously one cannot soley rely on this friend (potentially only for one buy).<br /><br />Thus i see no way as to how this could fail. It should not only be interesting for buyers but also for sellers -- In addition&nbsp; no one really seems to know how bitfog etc seem to work and if the coins arent really untraceable.<br /><br />Greetings and happy holidays<br /><br />DisBandment

				Guys you all do know BTC ARE LEGAL TO BUY? and when coming into SR they get tumbled? All that damn foggin and xtra BS yall are doing is not needed.. Unless your buying i guess hundreds and thousands worth at one time.. Your main issue is to KNOW PGP and make sure your address is clear, Nothing you do before making the buy on SR is Illegal ..
