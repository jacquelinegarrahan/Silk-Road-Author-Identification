				Yeah, I have been reading for months now how there are better ways to get BTC than Dwolla---&gt;mtgox but I would feel like even more of a chump if I didn&#039;t let everyone know my experience of how these companies fucked me over.<br /><br />&nbsp;I transferred $85 from Dwolla to mtgox. The money never arrived in my mtgox account so after a day I wrote them an email explaining the situation. They said that Dwolla now requires a government ID and a verified home address (utility bill, insurance statement etc.) before they will allow the money to go through. <br /><br />I never received an email about this new policy and never saw anything on either Dwolla&#039;s or mtgox&#039;s website regarding this change.<br /><br />With all the recent FBI heat that I am hearing about, I feel the best option is to simply walk away from my $85. Small price to pay to avoid sending my personal info and home address to known snitches (mtgox).<br /><br />It goes without saying that I will never be using either of these companies again and I hope this kept at least one person from using either Dwolla or mtgox for anything. There are much safer and faster options out there for obtaining BTC.

				I dont know. Why not just send the id or whatever they want and withdraw the btc back into your bank account? The is nothing illegal or sketchy about withdrawing your funds. Once you withdraw the money, never go back. I wouldnt want to lose 85 bucks personally, but to each his own.

The FBI has announced their plans (read the new sticky in the Security forums) to attempt to take down the btc. With all these factors, I feel like if I send mtgox my ID, my name, address and personal information will, at best, be put on some kind of &quot;list&quot;.<br /><br />It could be my foil hat speaking, but my peace of mind is worth 85 bucks. I&#039;m chalking this one up to the cost of partying.

				I started a tormail account so that for my next transaction I could use Bitinstant--&gt;Coinapult. For awhile I was using Bitinstant--&gt;mtgox which was much more private and safer than using dwolla but now I am boycotting mtgox.<br /><br />Mtgox has been an extremely unprofessional company in my experience. I strongly urge all users to find another btc vendor.

				I switched from Mtgox to CampBX after Mtgox messed up a deposit. I don&#039;t know if CampBX is any better that Mtgox, they both might be snitches to the gov for all I know.<br />

				Isnt Mtgox like the reserve bank, the setter of prices? So if they go down, where does that leave the btc economy? I heard people talk of Mtgox as if it is a ponzi scheme, they spent/invested peoples money and now there is not enough to arounf, so they juggle money and delay big payputs, but one day the music has to stop and some people will lose. <br />

Although, I seriously doubt that mtgox is &quot;too big to fail&quot; as we are all to familiar with in the US economy. There are still plenty of convenient ways to obtain btc without mtgox. The next biggest fish will take over, and the btc will be stronger than ever.
