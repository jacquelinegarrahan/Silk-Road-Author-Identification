				There are plenty of forums which could give you much more authoritative advice but I have some experience and know plenty of growers.<br />This is pretty UK centered advice so it may not apply to you. It may others a starting point for research.<br /><br />Loft- change your lights to CFL tubes, they emit less IR. With some trickery (and lots of Kingspan), you can make your roof space look IR neutral and like a &#039;normal loft&#039;. Plenty of growers make the mistake of using lots of reflective insulation (survival blanket stylee) and even if the lights &amp; convection aren&#039;t blatant, it&#039;s clear that the loft is being used for something unusual. One particular government &#039;green initiative&#039; involving roofs is helping growers no end&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Greenhouse- white it out. You can buy greenhouse whitening from B&amp;Q- it&#039;ll look suspicious to you because you know what&#039;s in there. To anyone else, it just looks like you&#039;re preventing your tomatoes from getting prematurely sun-dried.<br /><br />Polytunnels- The PVC is pretty opaque from 10ft, they&#039;re one of the safest options for growing. Keep an active garden and there&#039;s no reason you&#039;d arouse suspicion.<br /><br />Outdoors. There are 2 ways of being spotted from the air when you&#039;re growing outside- visual identification (I can see your plants) and spectral signature (emission signature wavelengths of light from plants). I&#039;m pretty sure the latter is mainly used in the US for spotting huge outdoor crops, I&#039;ve never heard of it being used in the UK.&nbsp; <br /><br />To minimize the risk of your plants being spotted from the air, a popular method is camouflaging the weed in with other plants. We&#039;ve done this a number of times: Mature raspberry canes provide excellent cover, as does a good row of Cleomes; some cultivars of Japanese Maple are good (nice palmate leaves). One hotter summer we did a SCROG type grow up the garden fence intertwined with Passion flowers, it looked gorgeous but we got a crap yield and the Passion fruits never ripened&nbsp; <br /><br />&#039;AFOAF&#039; who grew in Spain, used to have a couple of acres of Juniper (one of the short ones, J. communis)&nbsp; interspersed with weed plants- apparently they&#039;re indistinguishable from the air and have similar emission spectra. <br /><br />And if you are in the UK- fucking stinging nettles&nbsp; ;D Similar internodal length, leaf clusters around the stems, when they flower they look like male weed plants.

				Anti bird netting will fool them from the air, but might look a bit suss from the ground. Poly tunnels are by far the best option for growing decent amounts outside.<br />It&#039;s surprising how well weed plants can blend in, I once witnessed the police park right next to a field full of weed while they searched a cottage nearby, I was sure they must have seen them but they drove off empty handed:)<br />

				Move to California.....<br /><br />Get your card so you can grow your legal amount....<br /><br />Enjoy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gingrich and Santorum are out of the race, so we have at least 4+ more years before the DEA wastes time raiding private growers with medical cards.
