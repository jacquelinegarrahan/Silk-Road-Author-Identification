				I&#039;m new to this whole process so bear with me.<br />yesterday I used getbitcoin via my dwolla acct. trying to send the coins to my SL address.<br />today coins still are not credited.<br />In the Faqs page it says you have to DL a bitcoin block chain. I havent dont this and dont even know what it is ir where to DL it.<br /><br />however this morning I used a different method ( dwolla-bitinstant-bitcoinica- to my SL wallet) and the process was completed in minutes. just waiting for coins to show up in SL wallet....<br /><br />so my question is since I havent DLed whatever a block chain is does this mean my funds send via getbitcoins are now lost or whats the deal?<br />How can I remendy&nbsp; this situation?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never used dwolla before but I speculate the proper way to do it is: dwolla -&gt; your bitcoin wallet -&gt; your SR account<br /><br />Using this website you can follow your bitcoins and see where they went: blockexplorer.com

				I also have a Dwolla account.&nbsp; Dwolla deals with money only, not Bitcoins.&nbsp; SR deals only with Bitcoins.&nbsp; So you must use an intermediary to transfer the coins.&nbsp; As stated earlier you can: dwolla -&gt; your bitcoin wallet -&gt; your SR account.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a bitcoin wallet setup I would recommend this: dwolla -&gt; bitinstant -&gt; bitcoinfog -&gt; your SR account<br /><br />You basically go to bitinstant.com and setup the transfer from dwolla through bitinstant to either bitcoinfog or SR.<br /><br />I recommend bitcoinfog because it mixes the bitcoins (mixes them up with others coins numerous times moving them around some) which makes it much more (if not almost impossible) to track your financial transaction from your bank to SR.&nbsp; Hope this clears it up somewhat.

				i dont know about dwolla but i usually go get a moneypak from one of the many places they sell them (i usually switch it up from one location to another just as an added measure cuz im paranoid) and get one of the bitcoin vendors exchange it. they charge you but fuck it its easier for me. i can recomend btcbuddy. hes the only one ive tried honestly but i didnt feel any need to look further. it usually goes pretty fast too.

If you are having difficulties with your order, please contact us at support@get-bitcoin.com. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br /><br />support email has been bouncing back on me though<br />
