				Hey all, I used bitinstant to email (coinapult) and when I click on the link to retrieve my btc its showing up that I have none.&nbsp; Now when I click the link theres an expert on coinapult saying &quot;MtGox is holding up BitInstant transactions. We&#039;ve contacted them, and are working on fixing the issue.&quot;&nbsp; Do you think this is why my btc aren&#039;t in the link?

				I did a deposit at the bank this morning that was supposed to be deposited to a bitcoin address.&nbsp; That was 7 hours ago.&nbsp; They haven&#039;t shown up yet.&nbsp; I got the confirmation email from bitinstant that they were sent, but it&#039;s never taken this long before.&nbsp; Should I be worried?

				Why are you guys using a crummy service like coinapult anyway?<br />Email is a terrible method of sending bitcoins.

				I got a reply from bitinstant about hr ago.<br />He confirmed the problem relates to Mt Gox delaying W/Ds<br />I&#039;ve had minor issues in the past and this gentlemen has always made it right.<br />So I&#039;d say sit back and be patient , no need to panic just yet...<br />we&#039;ll see what happens in the next 24hrs<br /><br />reply as follows:<br /><br />We wanted to let you know that there is a currently an issue we are working on. <br /><br /><br />Your funds are 100% safe, and the Bitcoins were purchased. The issue is withdrawing from MtGox is a little delayed. <br /><br /><br />More info here: https://support.mtgox.com/entries/21788256-outage-33956-bitcoin-withdrawal-error<br /><br />from Mt Gox link:<br />Hello Mt.Gox Users,<br /><br /><br /><br />We have received reports that Bitcoin withdrawals cannot be initiated due to an invalid bitcoin address error message that appears when attempting to withdraw Bitcoins.&nbsp; We have been investigating this and the causes for this problem are: <br /><br />1) The high volume of&nbsp; small Bitcoin transactions.<br /><br />2) One of the mining pools not working well recently.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are working on resolving this and we would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience and your kind understanding in this matter.<br /><br /><br />

				Yeah I got the same message last night.&nbsp; I clicked the link in the email this morning and my coins were there, so you guys should check again.&nbsp; I was told it had to do something with mt. gox&#039;s API - the way they value the coins, so I&#039;m guessing bitinstant values the coins they send through mt. gox??&nbsp; Anyway hopefully just a small hiccup, let me know if you guys are still having problems.

				Having trouble with BC from Coinapult to SR. Block check shows trans confirmed, no BC in SR account. Usually takes a little time, not a day. Anyone else?

				Having the same problem with bitcoin to email - link shows up in tormail but when I click on it, it shows 0 bitcoins even though the email says otherwise. Hoping this gets resolved. Probably gonna ditch the coinapult service and just start sending everything to my bitcoin address.
