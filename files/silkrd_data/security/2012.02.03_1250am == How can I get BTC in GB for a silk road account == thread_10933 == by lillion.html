				How can you buy BTC with GBP or how can you fund your SR account with the coins you already have?<br />Intersango is a UK exchanger, Cryptoxchange does GBP, some others. Also bitcointalk.org forums

				If you&#039;re happy to use your bank account, Intersango is the quickest and easiest IMO. Simply transfer the cash into your Intersango account like any other payment you&#039;d make online, including the reference number in the details. Once that money is processed, buy the BTC at the going rate (or wait to see if the price drops) and transfer to SR through the accounts&gt;Bitcoins using your SR address. I would recommend using a wallet though as this further increases your anonymity and is very easy to set up. Good luck

There&#039;s two ways you can do this which I have tried...<br /><br />1. Buy your bitcoins directly on a primary market: The main market is Mtgox and they support deposits in GBP and will quote bitcoin market prices in GBP for you too. So basically you transfer your GBP funds by bank transfer to Mtgox&#039;s UK (Barclays) bank account and once the funds are cleared (in about 1 day), you will be able to buy your bitcoins. Once you have purchased them they will show up in your wallet on Mtgox and then you can withdraw them by pasting in the SR deposit address into Mtgox. Transfer of the bitcoins takes a couple of hours or more.<br /><br />2. Buy your bitcoins on a secondary market: One of the most popular secondary markets is bitmarket.eu which has a lot of UK-based Bitcoin sellers who will accept a UK bank transfer. In the secondy market you&#039;re buying from individual sellers and they will e-mail you their personal bank details for a bank deposit/transfer. This may seem more risky than dealing with the primary market, but bitmarket.eu provides an Escrow-type service and will hold the sellers bitcoins until you transfer the funds and they acknowledge funds as cleared. Once you have the bitcoins in your bitmarket.eu account, it&#039;s a simple matter of pasting in the SR deposit address again and your bitcoins are transferred within an hour or two usually.<br /><br />Either way is just as easy, but I think the primary market route gets you better prices than secondary market, although may be a bit slower to get funded and bitcoins withdrawn.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
