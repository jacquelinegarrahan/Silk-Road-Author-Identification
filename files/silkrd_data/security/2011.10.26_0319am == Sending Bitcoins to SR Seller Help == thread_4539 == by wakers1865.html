				Ok guys so I am new here so please be gentle. All of this tor / bitcoin studying has been a little overwhelming and I am a pretty smart gal. So I have opened a Dwolla account and it is funded. The next step I am assuming is I am going to buy bitcoins of of MT.GOX. <br /><br />Once I have Bitcoins in my account on MT.Gox its off to shopping on Silkroad, correct? Once I find a product I want I will check out.&nbsp; I guess the next part I find confusing. I will send Bitcoins to the seller from my Mt.gox account? How will this happen since I do not see a Bitcoin address in my mt.gox account. How does this exactly work? <br /><br />I was under the impression you had to download the bitcoin software from Bitcoin.org and put money into that 1st. <br /><br />I think I am about there just need a little confirmation as I do not want to accidently send BC to some terrorist group in Iraq ha thanks for the assitance fellas

				I recommend to send the coins to your own wallet, then once that&#039;s confirmed go ahead and send to your SR account (on the SR site, click on &quot;account&quot; up top, it will give you the address to send to). You&#039;ll figure it out!

				Yes buy BTC from mtgox. Funding through dwolla isn&#039;t the best way because it ties your bank account in your name to mtgox. It&#039;s better to keep mtgox anonymous. You can use get-bitcoin.com and pay with cash at a local bank branch. It does cost 5% but in the future its probably better to use that. It&#039;s also way faster than dwolla/mtgox. Once you have BTC in your mtgox account, its good to use instawallet.org to &#039;wash&#039; your bitcoins. Basically you send the coins from mtgox to the address in your instawallet, then to another instawallet then let them sit for a few hours. Then send to the address listed in the &#039;account&#039; section of SR. It will take an hour or 2 to get from one wallet to the other. Once your coins are in SR, make your purchase and enjoy!

				Pretty much agree w/vanilla on this one ^^^.&nbsp; At one time I&#039;d ov said, maybe, bank to dwolla to tradehill to wallet.dat....but after the good experience with exchangebtc, I too would go with direct deposit (cash) into local bank for get-bitcoin.com, then either to your own wallet&nbsp; andthen wash it once or twice online with instawallet, then on to SR...or just keep it in the cloud altogether, and not even bring it home at all....just leaves a trail...<br /><br />No i.d. necessary for the cash version, either...and takes a lot less time...bank to dwolla takes a long time, and most of the big xchanges don&#039;t even trust dwolla all that much, and u have to go thru bitinstant to get dwolla...btc and how to get them, is always changing, and, as we saw today, prone to ripoff from wannabe hustlers....make sure it&#039;s a reputable source...

				I totally get my mt.gox account being tied to Dwolla and Dwolla being tied to my bank acocunt. But once I send from Mt.gox to SR the Bitcoin addy changes and its pretty damm difficult to figure out where I sent the money? I honestly do not care if someone knows I have a bitcoin account on mt.gox I just do not see how anyone will ever see where I sent the money since the algorithm is broken. Long story short wouldnt the cops have to get my computer and log into my SR account and trace back? Seems like all that washing is kinda unecessary.. help me understand better

				Oh, I think you&#039;re probably right ^^^.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done similar, just in a hurry, whatever...it&#039;s just best to protect yourself as best you can.&nbsp; We none of us really know how much resources, what agencies, what gov&#039;t, what country will be looking at this, so we may &#039;overprotect&#039; at times...<br /><br />I simply use instawallet because they are so easy, and adds another layer.&nbsp; But is it absolutely necessary?&nbsp; Damn if I know...I&#039;ve said before that we tend to focus a lot of our energy on the electronic protection, when we aren&#039;t sure how much is necessary.&nbsp; That&#039;s why some people use Liberte Linux, some use Tails, some use just plain old Tor with no dress up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone else can explain the technical reasons, I just try to do what I can to protect, and not sure what is important, and what isnt...
