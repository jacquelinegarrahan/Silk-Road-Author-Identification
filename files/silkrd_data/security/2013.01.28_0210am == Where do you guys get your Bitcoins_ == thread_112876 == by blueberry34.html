				Hey guys, as the title says, I&#039;m trying to figure out YOUR preferred way of obtaining bitcoins. <br /><br />I have only done moneygram transfers so far, but I don&#039;t really like the amount of personal interaction involved with this...I&#039;m sure customer service reps at all these stores find me sorta sketchy, so I&#039;m trying to find an alternative method of buying bitcoins that&#039;s a lot more secure and anonymous.<br /><br />I used the search bar and nothing too relevant popped up so I decided to make this thread. Thanks in advance for all your input I appreciate it!<br /><br />blueberry

				My guy isn&#039;t taking new clients otherwise i would refer you but sugar mama and chronic crew will both do money paks and if you wanna go for speed I would recommend Blue sky traders they are good and fast you just do a cash deposit into their Bank of America account and by the time you get home the coins are in your account

				The usual places - BitInstant/ZipZap and some totally anonymous trades on bitcointalk (no &quot;S&quot; at the end!).org&nbsp; with folks who will exchange them for moneypaks/gift cards and also allow escrow.

				I like bitinstant. <br /><br />The clerks at these places will just think you are paying a bill or something like that. They have no idea what you are buying. There is nothing sketchey about it at all. People pay bills like this all the time. You would be surprised how many people don&#039;t have a bank account or credit card. <br /><br />You just feel that they are thinking of you like that. In reality they don&#039;t know what you are doing and probably don&#039;t care.<br /><br />When I got mine the lady looked completely disinterested.
