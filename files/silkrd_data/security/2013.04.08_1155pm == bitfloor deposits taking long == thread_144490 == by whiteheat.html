				I made a deposit over 5 hours ago and it still hasn&#039;t showed up in my account.&nbsp; Is this a real problem or is it just something that happens every once in awhile?&nbsp; I emailed support but haven&#039;t gotten an answer yet.&nbsp; I suppose its not too big a deal since the road is down tonight anyway, I just don&#039;t want my money to disappear is all.

				Yeah, boy!!<br /><br />I knew I wasn&#039;t the only one having fuckin issues with them today!&nbsp; Check this:<br /><br />I contacted support, and they told me that they are having processing delays with deposits, and to bear with them during the process.<br /><br /><br />Well, if salsify sells out of that cali orange before they fund me, I am gonna be smokin&#039; fuckin pissed, dog.

				Bitfloor&#039;s Twitter is saying, &quot;LocalTill is informing us that deposits made after 5PM EST will be processed the next morning. We have updated the website accordingly.&quot; That was at approx. 6pm EST.&nbsp; ;)

				Lol so I guess that means that the deposit I made yesterday after 5pm est won&#039;t be credited to my bitfloor account till tomorrow morning...feels like the longest 24 hour plus wait ever&nbsp; :o

				yeah, I gave them &quot;$1100 yesterday and it wasn&#039;t until 6 am this morning I was able to buy at $211. If it worked like it has before I would have got in at $177, I emailed them asking how to avoid this in the future, they didn&#039;t reply. I just checked my email, no response. They responded yesterday quickly to say that they had a problem, but when they tie up your money, you don&#039;t know how long it will be, no don&#039;t know why it happened, and you don&#039;t know if it will happen again, and they don&#039;t even write you back when you poliltely ask about avoiding future delays-I&#039;m considering another company. I&#039;ve heard good stuff about BitCopia (not sure about exact spelling)<br />In the internet age, I don&#039;t think a company can afford to not reply to a customer about a legitimate concern. <br />I have previously spoke highly of BitFloor before for their flawless execution, but they performed inadequately today. And they usually have higher prices than MtGox (I think it has something to do about the delay) I won&#039;t deal with MtGox because I don&#039;t want my business given to the government for entirely ethical reasons, so they are &#039;off my list&#039;<br />anybody else have a company they use that you deal with a bank with? I don&#039;t like money paks either, although I&#039;ve never used them.

				Wow. I made a deposit as soon as the bank opened yesterday and had the funds in my bitfloor account, literally 5 minutes later. Never had a problem with bitfloor

				I did one on Monday and had the funds credited within 15 minutes, then yesterday I start reading the horror stories of long time delays. Well this morning I run to the local bank deposit and by the time I came home 5 minutes later, funds were showing. So hopefully it was a 1 day issue.<br /><br />By the way on a little side note. I had to do a BTC transfer on Sunday, and man oh man is that the way to go. I had my 6 confirmation in less than 20 minutes. Beats the hell out of the recent slow done multi hour confirmations I have been seeing lately.
