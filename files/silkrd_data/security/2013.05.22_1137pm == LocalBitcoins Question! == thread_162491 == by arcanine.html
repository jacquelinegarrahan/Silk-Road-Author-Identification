				So I&#039;m a first time user of LocalBTC and I purchased online. I used a cash deposit option and went to the bank and deposited the appropriate amount. However, for whatever reason I didn&#039;t get back home in time to mark the payment as sent and the order was cancelled. <br /><br />My problem is obviously that I&#039;ve already deposited my $ into the vendors account but there is no order for BTC. I&#039;ve messaged support and the seller and am waiting their reply, but I was just wondering if anyone else had similar problems or any advise. Trying not to freak out, I just hope the vendor can send me my BTC and not troll me.

				I&#039;m curious as to how this played out for you. Unfortunately I do not have an answer for you, but I have worried about this as well since the website only gives you 90 minutes or so from the time you put the coins in escrow to the time you mark the invoice as complete.

				Why not just meet this person IRL? It takes little time and the transaction is done while you are together. My first time with LBTC was a face to face meet and it was done and over with in seconds.<br />Bank deposits sound like a hassle, try to meet in person. Avoid the hassle if you can.

To me, meeting someone in person is a hassle, especially for my location where there isn&#039;t a seller for several miles. On the other hand, there&#039;s a bank every mile and I don&#039;t have to worry about when or where to meet the person, so long as the bank is open, it&#039;s a quick and easy ordeal. The only hassle with doing a bank deposit is if you run into some insane delay where it takes you over an hour to get to the bank and back and then the timer runs out on your invoice. <br /><br />Which is what I&#039;m still curious about, what happens then?

				is there not somewhere you could get online near the bank? like a library or cyber cafe, or even take your laptop to the local mcdonalds/starbucks and use the free wifi there.

This will be my first bitcoin purchase and I&#039;m meeting tomorrow for a face to face with someone to buy a few bitcoins, and obviously i&#039;ll be bringing cash - as the seller explained it, i give him the cash, he does the transfer to my bitcoin address at blockchain, and he hits send on his iPhone and we sit there till it shows the first confirmation. I&#039;ll have my laptop with me, and figure, as the spot (starbucks) has wifi, i&#039;ll have my account on blockchain up and open to see that confirmation - or will i see it at my acct?<br /><br />sound kopesetic?<br /><br />tks<br />
