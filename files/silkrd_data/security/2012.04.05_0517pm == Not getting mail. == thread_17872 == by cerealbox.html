				So I ordered some shrooms from Rocker who, the last time I ordered from him, got the product within one day of shipping. This time, however, it&#039;s Thursday and he shipped Monday night. And I also noticed that for two days in a row now, the mailman has been picking up mail, but not sending us any (and that&#039;s very unusual for my household). Is it possible there&#039;s some sort of hold on my mail because they found the shrooms? Or am I just being paranoid?

				Mister Dank, You truly have some serious paranoia issues. Do you realize how ridiculous you sound saying EVERYONE with a small issue is a cop. Why are you on this site if you&#039;re this paranoid? If what you say was actually true, you would be complete fool to be selling shit here. Your the person that seems the most like a cop here. But you&#039;re probably just a delusional person who amuses himself by spreading your bullshit.

				I&#039;ve ordered from Rocker and everything was legit. The shrooms were the most potent I&#039;ve ever had and the packaging was flawless. I have missed two orders from across the Atlantic that have never showed after a month and a half. The vendor gave me a refund but it freaks me out to order from overseas again.

Actually fuck it, you may as well include anyone who has ever insulted you full stop. Even if they were wrong, you deserved it.

Maybe a bit too much credit where it wasn&#039;t due? <br /><br />Now then Dank I suggest you wander back to the zoo where you belong you degenerate animal. Remember to check your DANK-hole when you walk past the Chimpanzee enclosures though, I know you&#039;ll get paranoid about one fucking you in the arse and giving you A.I.Ds.<br /><br />P.S.

I&#039;ve even asked people if they think it looks compressed and here&#039;s what 5/5 of them said &quot;No, it just looks like a tight juicy bud&quot;.<br /><br />MisterDank, some of the things I see you say around here are so absurd that I actually question if you believe what you&#039;re saying. I&#039;m not going to call you a cop or anything.... Everyone is entitled to their opinion.. but just know that practically nobody anywhere shares your opinion o this matter, especially on &quot;Smashed&quot; weed = Schwag. Feel free to believe it if you want to. <br /><br />I&#039;m not low enough to stoop to insulting you like everybody else... but seriously dude, you don&#039;t think it&#039;s the slight bit odd that practically nobody shares your opinion on the Vac sealed weed who order on here, and the people that buy the weed from the people who buy in bulk on here... Like I said, your opinion is your opinion, make it whatever you want - It&#039;s a good practice to take the majorities opinions and reasoning into account when forming your opinions also, instead of just assuming they&#039;re all idiots because they haven&#039;t been in the Weed came as long as you.

				Sorry but if he is going to get sharp like that after someone pulls his leg then he deserves all the abuse he gets. <br /><br />Why pussyfoot around wankers when you can just put them in their place? And this my fellow forum members, is most definitely, one total wanker.

				Noone needs to ban anyone. Did anyone notice that he stopped talking a week ago and limetless still needs to keep on about it?<br />But I&#039;m confused. Why is there an actual address posted on this page?<br />Do the mods take that type of thing down?&nbsp; If this address is posted for spite- Shame on you.

				I actually just finished crying because I was laughing so hard at the assertion I could be LE. To me, that&#039;s one of the the funnier things I&#039;ve ever heard. ::)<br /><br />Glad your order showed up cereal, the USPS can be a little less than predictable at times, but, by and large it&#039;s a very reliable service.<br /><br />I love my customers, thanks for always sticking up for me when I get bullied. &lt;3<br /><br />Rocker<br />

				Anyone claiming that Rocker is a law enforcement officer obviously hasn&#039;t dealt with Rocker. Fast, discreet shipping and awesome shrooms. <br />That&#039;s it.
