				Okay, I tried to buy something the other day where the seller told me to put my pgp key in WITH my message, not separate and like an idiot I put my encrypted message and then my encrypted pgp key. A couple days later the seller sent me a message that said I did something wrong with the message or the key and he couldn&#039;t read it, and he had to cancel my order. I did the same thing with 2 different sellers and one got my order shipped out immediately, the other canceled. I messaged him to ask what I did wrong and what I could do to fix it and re-order but after 2 days he still hasn&#039;t replied. <br /><br />can anyone tell me how to post my pgp key in WITH my message. i always type my message into a word pad then encrypt it, then drag and drop my pgp key into the wordpad and it automatically encrypts itself. <br /><br />is there a way to type my message, then my pgp key and encrypt them together? I&#039;ve been reading all day and i can&#039;t figure this shit out, but i&#039;d really like to re-order with this guy but he cancels my order if i dont encrypt them together. somebody help me please. this shits raising my blood pressure.

				export your key to a text file. then open that text file. type your message above your key. save the file as message.txt. then encrypt the text file with the sellers pub key. open the resulting file. copy/paste it to PM or address field. done!
