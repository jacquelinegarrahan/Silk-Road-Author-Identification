				Stay away from vendors that require &quot;picture/passport verification&quot; as the Patriot Act is wide spread<br /><br />The US Regulatory Commission division is most probably looking at recent dwolla records<br /><br />stay safe &amp; always ask

				I wouldn&#039;t suggest bitinstant to anyone anymore. I recently tried using them again and I was asked to provide an ID with the transaction. Not sure if this was random or what.

I have used them in the past and not had to prove my identity. I have used them through a CVS and not had to provide an identity.<br /><br />Though most recently, I tried to use a CVS and they asked for my license. They stated that it was a global CVS policy to require an ID for a transaction like mine. I tried to explain that I&#039;ve done it before without an ID and that I didn&#039;t have one one me. They wouldn&#039;t budge so I bailed on the order for now.

				I used BitInstant on Friday, and they didn&#039;t ask for my ID, although I did have some trouble with it. They clerk at the MoneyGram place told me he was getting some kind of authorization error. He said he had never seen that error before and he got on the phone and talked to somebody who was able to fix it, although it was very nerveracking. I was using a fake name, of course, so I naturally assumed it was due to that. I nearly shit my pants I was so scared and almost cancelled the whole transaction. Luckily i didn&#039;t, though, and it all went through. Got my coins ;D Still don&#039;t know what it was all about though.

				Guys, some cashiers ask for ID and some don&#039;t, it&#039;s no big deal. I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re trained to do so, maybe some are and some aren&#039;t. But it&#039;s nothing. <br /><br />You really shouldn&#039;t need to provide ID though, since you&#039;re simply sending money or paying a bill or whatever, as far as they know. You&#039;re not making a withdrawal, you&#039;re basically making a purchase like any other. Bitcoins aren&#039;t illegal. The cashier at CVS couldn&#039;t care less that you&#039;re buying them, even if they&#039;re aware that you are, which most of them aren&#039;t. People do Moneygrams all the time. Just go somewhere else and hope they don&#039;t ID.<br /><br />And yeah, the system fucks up, a lot. Sometimes it can take 5 minutes to process, sometimes it doesn&#039;t work at all, but it&#039;s nothing to be concerned about. Y&#039;all are paranoid.

				I&#039;ve been told they sometimes ask for ID when the transaction amount is high... So if u r extremely paranoid, get a bank account using a fake ID and use coinbase.com<br /><br />It&#039;s what I do now ;)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you can use coinbase outside of the USA tho... But it won&#039;t hurt to try
