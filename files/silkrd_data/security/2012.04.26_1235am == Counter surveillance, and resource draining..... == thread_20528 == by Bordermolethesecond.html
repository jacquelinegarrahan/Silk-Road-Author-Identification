				Ok, I take it we aren&#039;t phase three smugglers on here but at whatever level you are at, what methods would you use to drain the resources of local LE? <br /><br />Also what counter surveillance techniques would you use?

				Seriously though, this &#039;smuggler level&#039; profiling model is 50% accurate, 50% bullshit, it&#039;s way more complicated than that in reality. He&#039;s right that LE gets tripped up by using 1 pair of glasses to see the world, but wrong to imply that kind of profiling is going to help LE in any way whatsoever. They&#039;ll still get it wrong, just in a much more refined way, LOL! I read them both, and that much was painfully obvious from the outset.<br /><br />Anyway, intelligent LE already are Oh-My-God nauseatingly familiar with this pattern, it&#039;s very similar to the divide between economists and floor traders at NYSE, both groups think they know better than the other. You have one camp trying to work out how to best wiretap some suspiciously flash young dude while the other camp is coming up with Karl Marx&#039;s theory of social discourse where the proletarians will arise and break the chemical chains of their feudal drug lords... I shit you not. <br /><br />Just you wait, you&#039;ll get another update on the subject in a couple of years saying, &quot;well actually, we have evidence there&#039;s *six* types of smuggler so boo yah&quot; and then even later they&#039;ll be whitepapers with titles like: &quot;The adaptive smuggler personality type hypothesis&quot; which will conclude we&#039;re all actually psychopaths, meta-surveys on types of smugglers and other junk. Academics publish or perish. Finding useful information in whitepapers, especially those in the social sciences or humanities, is like digging for gold. You get a ton of shit and if you&#039;re lucky you hit a rich ore seam to follow up. If you think that everybody who becomes a professor or gets a PhD is smart, then boy, you&#039;ve never read the ocean of junk whitepapers that lap at the door of the ivory towers. It&#039;s a fucking desert. Vultures swoop overhead searching for victims of academia unable to reach an oasis (tenure). <br /><br />Basically, until your professor *was actually a drug smuggler himself*, it&#039;s hopeless, truly introspective people are as rare as Sherlock Holmes amongst the legion of plod and probably just as fictional. This is what happens when there&#039;s no connect between the empirical world and the theoretical one, or too much time needs to pass to build up statistically sound hypotheses about the big picture. I digress. <br /><br />--<br /><br />On CS and resource draining. Some thoughts:<br /><br />- You want sensors on your vehicle, person to detect tracking devices. Doesn&#039;t usually come cheap.<br /><br />- You want to be using a Faraday bag to pick up packages. Cheap to build yourself but you can buy some nice ones online. The bags basically kill pretty much any microwave, radiowave, whatever-wave a tracking device might emit. <br /><br />- Just common sense things like making fake drops or pickups and alternating these into your daily schedule. Immediately the odds of a interception are not looking hopeful for LE. <br /><br />- Do you know a drug dealer? Is he your competitor? Yes. Does he know about you? No. Is your friend looking for work? Yes? Great! Send this morally motivated but sorely underfunded citizen with a bug to become an informant. Just tell them what they already know and get paid for it. 90% of the information you want to know about LE, is open source, implicit information you pick up by simply passively being in the vicinity asking no questions. Why do you think this board is monitored by LEO? They know this too. Note: I don&#039;t do this myself, but the Hells Angels and others have done this for literally decades with great success. So if you have enormous testicles this is definitely worthwhile. Information + a source of funding for the new Harley I guess. Protip: feed him an anxiety reducing pill like citalopram to calm the nerves. Works for you too if you&#039;re cordially invited to spend some time &quot;helping the police with their inquiries&quot;.<br /><br />- Purchase some radio equipment and listen in on the police broadcast channels. Listen to it for a day or so to get an overall picture of the state of play in your area. This can be your &#039;radio&#039; while you work on SR.<br /><br />- A LE officer said something interesting about local newspapers. If you read these searching for references it can be useful. If you have a myriad of complaints about needles being dropped everywhere, then expect a &#039;clean the streets&#039; operation in the near future so you need to be more conservative than usual. Basically the local rag serves as an early warning barometer similar to American&#039;s fruity color code for possible levels of terrorism activity e.g. yellow, red, blah blah. Put a calendar on your wall and count the number of articles on drugs over time. You should begin to see patterns and get to know the local actors influencing police action.<br /><br />- The last two were better tips for those working offline rather than online. Here&#039;s a tip for the geeks. Are you aware that you can purchase hardware keyloggers that can wirelessly transmit keystrokes up to 1km or more away? You get a pal to become a temporary cleaner or paperwork shuffling intern at your local police station. Installation is a two stage operation. He carries a tiny covert (no click-shutter sound!) camera which photographs two things:<br /><br />1. The keyboard of the detective/officer.<br />2. The title plate of his door.<br />3. Any maps on the wall in the office. LE love those those symbolic moments.<br /><br />Then you choose your primary target. If you can&#039;t get him, get his secretary&#039;s work station instead, in information terms secretaries are just slightly lower grade versions of their bosses and may be even more useful since they do so much of the grunt work.<br /><br />Purchase an identical keyboard model to the target. Note any uniquely identifying items like stickers, because that could be a problem. Then install the hardware keylogger into the keyboard itself and get your pal to return it back to it&#039;s location. This is completely undetectable by hardware or software or operating system believe it or not. There is no attack short of physical inspection that can counter this and the keylogger circuit itself can be encrypted. The wireless signal can be detected however, but it can be configured to appear as if it&#039;s a cellphone or a nearby router etc. Special keyloggers, very expensive, can even send screenshots and are remotely configurable. You could encrypt the screenshots or keystroke text files and upload them online to a public hosting service for example, and then use a proxy to visit that site. Generally the keylogger itself uses bluetooth or some similar short range transmission technology, and a component hidden outside the police building retransmits the signal much further afield or better yet integrates with mobile telephony.<br /><br /><br />

I agree that profiling same as counter profiling tricks are both BS. it may work may not, but it works for cops and custom most of the time. I&#039;ve been crossing border with gun hidden in the car&#039;s trunk once. Custom guy asked me, if I have a guns or drugs, - I said NO, I actually forgot about this gun, because it was hidden there for very long time. So, I said - NO and it was very natural NO.<br /><br />That guy asked to come another senior officer and asked him if they should look for a gun in my car. he was certain 100% that I have a gun. HOW the foke he knows.&nbsp; Still remains a mystery for me. Luckily they did not searched a let me go.<br /><br />what two categories is here on SR: - first just drop they mail and they only care to get the mony back fast, and another who do statistics and monitor delivery times and do a lot of other work and verification of packing methods, even before they ship one first real order. First group is just opportunity vendors, they all will be gone, sooner is better. Second group who are not lazy willing to work hard and willing to learn the trade, they will be on top and can stay on long stretch. <br /><br />but that is for sure, ask a guy what he thinks about counter surveillance, and u get pretty clear idea, if ya gonna deal with him or not.
