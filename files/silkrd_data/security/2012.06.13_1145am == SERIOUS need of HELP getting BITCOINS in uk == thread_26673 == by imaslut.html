				Use Intersango, they are really good and reasonably fast.<br />Use telephone banking and tell the person to put the reference on it, depending on your bank you may or may not be able to include a reference when using internet banking.<br /><br />How much of a slut are you? I am in need of one and have lots of BTCs....

				I don&#039;t want to sound condescending, but if you cannot work out how to use Intersango then I do wonder how you are going to get on in the world of international drug trafficking.<br /><br />Their site pretty much spells out exactly what you have to do, I can hold your hand through the process if you want.<br />How were you planning on transferring money to Intersango if you are not aware even of telephone banking? Assuming that you are set up for internet banking (not sure how else you would transfer the money but...) then just call your bank (number is on the back&nbsp; of your card) and go through to the payments section but make sure you choose to speak to a person rather than using an automated service. Tell them it is real important to have the reference number on it and give them the bank details off the Intersango site.<br />Buying them off poker sites and shit is asking to get ripped off mate.

				hahaha nah feel free to come across condescending, i can imagine i sound like a right mackrel asking for help on the basic task of aquirring bitcoins.<br />&nbsp;the only problem im encountering is that there is no text box for my reference code, has anyone else noticed this?<br /><br />same as blizzcoin, no button to send payment and get the ball rolling so to speak.<br />&nbsp;am i missing something, im not normally this much of an airhead<br />i am relatively new to the deepnet, i find navigating not a problem. contact and communication with vendors not a problem<br />&nbsp;only problem i have is aqquring bitcoins, guess il go back to intersango and give it a crack<br /><br />ta for the help tho peeps,<br />i do appreciate you lendin a hand to a noob like myself

				Sorry, you are doing it wrong.<br /><br />The box to the right hand side is to withdraw money to your bank account.<br /><br />What you need to do is copy down their bank info and use it to transfer money from your bank account to theirs, you can either do this in your branch, via internet banking or by telephone.<br /><br />If you cannot work out how to do that then I strongly suggest you take the following steps:<br /><br />1. Unplug your computer and place in the garden<br />2. Smash it with a sledgehammer<br />3. Do not buy drugs off the internet in future

				I am one step ahead Raoul, I got a thing of fishing line earlier for that very reason. It&#039;s not as abrasive as string but you have to be careful not to pull too hard on it as it can cut right through their tails.<br /><br />Lim, when do you reckon the wank mittens will be in the shops? It&#039;s father&#039;s day on Sunday and you could make a killing if you get them out by then.

				You see this is what happens when I choose to have breakfast with my girlfriend rather than check the SR forums this morning - lesson learned people, money comes before everything!<br /><br />To the OP - online methods to buy Bitcoins are not nearly as safe as using cash. Please feel free to send me a message if you want a quick and easy way to get your Bitcoins.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.
