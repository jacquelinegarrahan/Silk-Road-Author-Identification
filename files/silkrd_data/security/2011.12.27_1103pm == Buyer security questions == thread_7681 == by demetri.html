				Title: <strong>Buyer security questions </strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				What is to prevent law enforcement from setting up as dealers on SR to trap people trying to buy drugs? Assuming there&#039;s no checks on sellers to prevent that, could/would they do that as a way of arresting buyers?<br /><br />Is it more risky for an EU buyer to order from another EU country rather than just buying from domestic sellers? Does Airmail crossing EU borders get scanned or be subjected to any special checks domestic mail wouldn&#039;t do? Surely it must, else big drug rings would be using Airmail to smuggle in heroin?<br /><br />If a seller asks people to finalize early, should buyers be very wary and hearing alarm bells..or is that a normal practice for established sellers? Why would sellers want buyers to finalize early? To help cashflow problems or to protect themselves against bogus buyer claims? Surely in either case its a sign of a bad seller practice..since if you don&#039;t have funds to buy your wares you can&#039;t be very good...and sellers should be using registered mail to cover against lost order claims?<br /><br />That brings me to registered/signed-for mail... I can see the benefit to sellers and buyers, it clears up problems with lost orders and means sellers can be more confident using escrow...but does it present additional risk for sellers? They need to hand over items at Post Office. and give their address etc. <br /><br />Would welcome your thoughts and comments on these issues..both from the sellers and buyers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				What is to prevent law enforcement from setting up as dealers on SR to trap people trying to buy drugs?<br />---Buyers often ask for pictures with the sellers username in them to verify they actually have the drugs. But other than that, this could definitely happen.<br /><br />Assuming there&#039;s no checks on sellers to prevent that, could/would they do that as a way of arresting buyers?<br />---They definitely could if they wanted to. You could get charged with &quot;conspiracy to possess narcotics&quot;. This is not entrapment as LE is not deceiving you as to what you&#039;re buying.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is it more risky for an EU buyer to order from another EU country rather than just buying from domestic sellers?<br />---I&#039;m not from the EU, but in almost all instances, it&#039;s safer to order domestic as there are less security checks than international packages. Also, in the USA I think there are more serious charges for interstate drug trade.<br /><br />Does Airmail crossing EU borders get scanned or be subjected to any special checks domestic mail wouldn&#039;t do?<br />---I couldnt tell you.<br /><br />If a seller asks people to finalize early, should buyers be very wary and hearing alarm bells..or is that a normal practice for established sellers?<br />---If the seller is new or does not have any/great feeback, buyers should definitely be wary. It&#039;s possibly a scam.<br /><br />Why would sellers want buyers to finalize early? To help cashflow problems or to protect themselves against bogus buyer claims?<br />---Yes to both. Some sellers want to keep a steady cashflow and not have money tied up for weeks. Also, new buyers often need to finalize early to prevent buyer fraud.<br /><br />sellers should be using registered mail to cover against lost order claims?<br />---I don&#039;t know how it works in the EU but using registered mail sacrifices some anonymity for the seller and sometimes packages are profiled if the DCN is checked through tor.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the reply Asbury. <br /><br />Your replies on the possible enforcement infiltration has alarmed me I must say. It seems to me the best and quickest way for the DEA to shut down this place down would be to pose as dealers and make a loads of very public arrests.. it would send buyers running for cover. <br /><br />Surely the guys behind this operation have considered this though? If they haven&#039;t some safeguards and checks in place, they really should be thinking about putting some in quickly to vet new sellers.. the problem is tho, whatever they come up with, any determined DEA officer or police officer is likely to be able to get around I imagine..<br /><br /><br /><br />

Stick with sellers that have good reputation on the market and in the forums.&nbsp; If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

				i&#039;ve often wondered the same re: LE posing as sellers on SR.&nbsp; seems fairly safe to stick to trusted, long standing sellers, but who&#039;s really to say that they aren&#039;t just DEA agents building up a huge case file on SR members?<br /><br />also have wondered how many vendors actually destroy shipping information after a transaction is completed

If for some reason a LEO gains access to his data, it wouldn&#039;t help his case to have contact info for several strangers all over the globe - and the vendor can&#039;t be sure that any given buyer isn&#039;t known to LE for involvement in the drug trade (which would make having his name on your computer that much more incriminating). And what do they get on the other hand? That is, what does a vendor stand to gain by keeping a shipping address after the transaction is completed?

Of course, with printed labels, one&#039;s address could still be on their computer<br /><br />
