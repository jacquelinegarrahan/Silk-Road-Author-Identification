				So i think im finally getting the hang of this but want to clear some stuff up that i am not sure about.<br />I just figured out how to decrypt and encrypt messeges, but am unsure how i should go about including my public key. Im running PortablePGP. Do i type my messege then paste my public key after it?&nbsp; Or when i hit encrypt does it the program include it? Or do i encrypt my messege, paste in the email and then paste my public key under it?<br /><br />And what does it mean to &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;verify&quot; in PGP? <br /><br />Also could someone help me run a test to see if i am doing this correctly?<br /><br />Sorry for the stupid questions, i just wanna get this right! And thanks for any help!

				Wr3tch3d helped me out with this earlier.<br />&quot;save a file on notepad/text with vendors public key in file, then import that file into your pgp client. then create a file called message.txt (or something similar) type your message into that file, and select encrypt in your pgp client.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;during the encryption stage, there will be a text output or ASCII output option. that is what formats the output file to give a message like the one I sent you. then you paste that instead of attaching the file.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;make sure you use the text output option so you can copy/paste the text from the resulting file into a PM instead of having to attach the file.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; select that file, and follow the prompts to select my key. once you finish, open the new file that was created (i.e. message.txt.gpg) copy the cyphertext from that file,&quot;
