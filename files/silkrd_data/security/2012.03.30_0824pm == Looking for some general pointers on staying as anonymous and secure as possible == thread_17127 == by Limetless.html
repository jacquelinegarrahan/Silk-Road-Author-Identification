				Ok, so I have just set up shop on The Road (today as it happens) but naturally, I want to make sure I&#039;m as secure as possible. I already use TrueCrypt and use a good antivirus but when it comes to TOR I&#039;m not overly clued in. So really what I am saying is I&#039;d appreciate anyone giving me tips/advice on how to optimize TOR to make it as secure as possible. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Limet<br /><br />P.S - It would be great if someone could let me know how to speed it up too!&nbsp;

				Hey! first off are you just using the tor browser? id strongly recommend using liberte, its a version of linux that runs on a usb that can easily be hidden and is very secure. more info and a guide can be found below.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />As to speeding up tor there isnt much that can be done :/

				no prob pal, if you sort out liberte it has a GnuPG client built in, i strongly recommend installing it before going much further, all you need is a usb nothing huge a 512mb will do just ensure to backup your stuff first :) if you dont want to and still need a hand installing gnupg just holla
