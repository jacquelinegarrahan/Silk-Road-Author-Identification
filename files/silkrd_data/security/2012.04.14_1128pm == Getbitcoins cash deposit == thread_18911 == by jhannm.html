				I see that Intersango have swapped banks and are now with Metro, there&#039;s a note on their site saying that cashiers have been instructed not to accept cash for Intersango deposits, from now on it has to be transfers from your bank or other a/c. Be careful out there!

				Not sure if you&#039;re still having the issue.&nbsp; But, I just did a cash deposit today with get-bitcoins.&nbsp; For some reason (didn&#039;t see it mentioned on the site) they weren&#039;t allowing Chase deposits, so I went ahead and did it through Bank of America.&nbsp; Waiting on the coins to come through now.&nbsp; Last time I bought coins through them I only waited about 2-3 hours from the time I sent them my receipt and when I got the coins.

				Thanks guys, my plan is to do cash deposit through bitinstant&gt;mtgox&gt;bitcoinfog&gt;SR, only accessing mtgox through my local library computer, never through tor as i heard they report all users accessing their site through tor or something of that nature, how does this plan sound? still a little nervous seeing as it&#039;s my first time and reading that post about the person who had feds busting down there door after placing an order on silk road.

				Your planned sounds pretty damn good mate! A little over protective but its better to be safe than sorry! Anyways the dude who got busted if im not mistake was using wire transfers. You should be fine using your method. Also I really dont think that any LE are going after ppl getting small BTC.&nbsp; There looking for the big fishes like vendors and what not. Well thats my .02&#039;s anyways..... Goodluck!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Keeponsmiling

				Thanks man, I&#039;ve been reading as much as possible in the forums trying to find the best route for bitcoins, I also read he was doing a wire transfer which sounds fucking sketchy, I&#039;m only going to be doing cash deposits at banks. Hopefully I&#039;ll be placing my first order by the end of the week, I&#039;ll keep you guys posted on how things workout. Any other pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,

				Yeah, they removed the cash deposit via Chase. I just did a Bank of America deposit this afternoon and had the coins in 4 hours. Quicker than usual. When I first started using them lat last year, it took about 16-18hours. In February, they had some issues. One of my orders took about 36 hours. Got refunded the fee though. Then one of my orders in March only too 2 hours. <br /><br />BTW, didn&#039;t have any issues today with the teller at BofA. No address requested.

				A BTC wallet. Or sometimes direct to SR if I&#039;m in a pinch but then afterwards I&#039;ll change my SR bitcoin address. <br /><br />And make sure you use a &quot;false&quot; email with them. Don&#039;t use one of your regular ones. <br /><br />LE can&#039;t prove it&#039;s you just because the IP addy to the email points to your location. If you&#039;re really paranoid, use a proxy when you set up your fake, say, Yahoo account. Then when you communicate with Get-bitcoin, you can also use a proxy. I haven&#039;t used TOR with them in case they get like MTGox and flag your account for having used it. <br /><br />But I have used Get-bitcoin more than a dozen times. The majority of my transactions went off without a hitch. The ones that did have issues, I still got my coins less their fee. So it worked out in the end. I can think of 2 times I had issues. But both were settled before 36 hours. <br /><br />

				And there&#039;s this from Getbitcoin:&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;When emailing us, please don&#039;t use an @tormail.net or @safe-mail.net address!

I normally don&#039;t purchase BTC, I farm it, but this sale kind of made me want some backup coin.<br /><br />As for previous posters and their concerns, IF you had done it this way you have at least a receipt which proves you made payment.&nbsp; They are a legitimate business and will pay you as long as there is proof of payment.&nbsp; If you did a mail in cash or money card with no additional info, I have heard of them scamming and saying they never received it, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;Just FYI to the poster above worried about the prepaid debit card...I would be worried, check the balance of the card if you have the means and give any proof of withdrawal to gbc.

				Bitinstant is much more reliable if you&#039;re comfortable using clearnet on Mt Gox. Quicker and way less sketchy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Get-Bitcoin lately, they&#039;re pretty sketchy honestly but they always come through. Just deposited several hundred into Chase, and it&#039;s been a couple hours so far. If I had used BitInstant I&#039;d already have coin on my SR, but I used Get-Bitcoin lol.

So after your confirmation e-mail it could be another 12 hours before it hits your instawallet. Then potentially another few hours for your coin to confirm(if something got messed up, happened to me twice). Then from Instawallet to SR it takes a few hours.<br /><br />So it&#039;s a pretty long process actually, but not very long at the same time. Probably just seems long cause you&#039;re constantly clicking refresh in your e-mail or on Instawallet page lol.<br /><br />Also- I&#039;ve been reading around that they do not actually give you back your fee even if it exceeded 24 hours. Pretty annoying, but it&#039;s never exceeded 24 hrs for me, usually from 2-12 hours. They would probably always go through though, but like all businesses you just gotta annoy the hell out of them if they&#039;re being dicks.

				It&#039;s just all about &#039;managing risk&#039; not about getting rid of it altogether.&nbsp; Some things are obviously more dangerous than others.&nbsp; But I find speculating in bitcoins kind of fun, and as far as I know, legal.&nbsp; Same as chatting on these forums is.&nbsp; But at the same time, just in case somewhere, someday, some overzealous DA would try to make some kind of insane case against some piddly buyer he confused with me, I use Tails and a few other goodies to confound them, and try to spread my btc around.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s fun to try different &#039;storage&#039; locations online, nothing wrong with that...<br /><br />Our biggest problem, as I see it, is that it&#039;s all speculation: we just don&#039;t know what is dangerous to do, and what isn&#039;t, and until something really bad happens, we all have a bit of balance between total paranoia and &#039;who gives a fuck.&#039;&nbsp; I&#039;ve used getbitcoins with no problems several times, and I&#039;ve also got a friend here, btcbuddy, who I&#039;ve used...so we&#039;ve choices, and the risks are, well, risks.<br />

There&#039;s like a 5% chance it&#039;ll be lost, and that&#039;s something you don&#039;t wanna take. If you don&#039;t have a ride to the bank or a car, just throw down 20 bucks and get a damn taxi. DO NOT MAIL CASH DUDE, it&#039;d be a bad mistake :S.<br /><br />And get-bitcoin takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 5 hours for the confirmation email, then another few hours for the btc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What he said. My girlfriend sent $300 cash by mail to pay a speeding ticket...Long story short, she got her licensed suspended for failure to pay because the money never showed up. Postal workers can and WILL steal your shit. I&#039;m sure missing packages are more likely thieving postal workers than customs.<br /><br />As for Get-Bitcoin, I&#039;ve used them over a dozen times (Chase bank deposit) for amounts exceeding $1300 and only once did I not receive in 24 hours..But that was the fault of MtGox (Where they are sending from), not Get-Bitcoin. Highly recommend them for the quickest way to get bitcoins. If you want to avoid the 5% fee, going Dwolla &gt; MtGox &gt; wallets/SR takes significantly longer but only a $0.25 fee.

				I&#039;ve had good results using bitinstant.com in conjunction with http://www.coinapult.com/.&nbsp; coinapult seems well integrated with bitinstant, quickly sending bitinstant&#039;s converted BTC&#039;s to whatever wallet you designate.<br /><br />I simply had coinapult send the btc&#039;s directly to my SR Account Wallet.&nbsp; Maybe I should add the bitfog step for added security, but so far no problems.<br /><br />Does anybody else have experience using bitinstant/coinapult?&nbsp; If so, any thoughts or things I should watch out for?
