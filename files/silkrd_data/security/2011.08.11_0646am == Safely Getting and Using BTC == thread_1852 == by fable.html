				Ok, I was wondering if there is any safer way to do this since this was the only way I saw. (Besides selling droogs to get the BTC)<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m doing this:<br /><br />Bank --&gt; Dwolla --&gt; MtGox or Tradehill --&gt; SR<br /><br />Since I&#039;m tying my Dwolla account to MtGox anyway, my MtGox and TH account were made using legitimate information. Is BTC safe enough to use like this? Thanks!<br /><br />- fable

				I have setup dwolla and mtgox accounts under fake name, address, phone, etc, only real bank account.<br /><br />I also send them through http://www.bitcoinlaundry.com/ and few throw away wallets at https://www.instawallet.org/ then finally send to SL.<br /><br />You don&#039;t want a direct path from your account to SL. send it through other wallets, this way you can always say you paid someone to wallet X for say furniture or whatever. Also, access those wallets through Tor, then there&#039;s no proof that you sent the coins to yourself or someone else :)

It&#039;s not a crime to own Bitcoins, but you probably want to remove the link between the Bitcoin exchanger and SR. As suggested, laundering your Bitcoins is a good idea. But be careful, I used MyBitcoin to break the link between Bitcoin exchanger and SR just days before it went down.&nbsp; I now see I was lucky to get my coins in and out of there.

				I was also ready to make a purchase on SR using the Bank --&gt; Dwolla --&gt; Mt Gox method. I guess I shouldn&#039;t? Does anyone know if it will affect my Dwolla balance if I change all my personal information but leave my bank account in place? Or is there something else easy I could do to better ensure anonymity?<br /><br />Also, should I be using Dwolla in TOR? I haven&#039;t been; I don&#039;t really see the necessity of doing so.

				If you make a buy transaction on MtGox you&#039;ll get an email confirmation with your IP address, which links the computer you&#039;re at to the transaction.&nbsp; Now there&#039;s a link between you and the bitcoins you bought. Since that connection has already been made it would be wise to, as gallanonim1115 suggested, send the bitcoins through an intermediary such as https://www.instawallet.org/

				Thanks. When ordering from SR do you usually encrypt your address?<br /><br />And how much should I have to worry? I&#039;m only thinking of ordering an eighth of weed and then I&#039;ll probably never use this site again out of fear, ha.

				There&#039;s also bitcoinexchange.cc and bitcoin-otc, which eliminate the need for bank linkage.

				If it&#039;s less than $1000 worth, you could try GetBitcoin ( https://get-bitcoin.com/ ). You just mail them cash or money order and they send the Bitcoins worth the same amount (less a 5% fee) to whatever Bitcoin address you specified. I&#039;ve only used it once, but I can report it went smoothly.

				I&#039;ve already noticed there are members here waaaay more knowledgeable about the topic than I am, but I think it&#039;s safe to say that starting the whole chain with a bank account in your name is always a bad idea.<br /><br />It&#039;s a matter of best practices in general. Never start from a take-off point that can be linked to you. I think in most countries now you can find some sort of prepaid payment means you can use at the various exchanges. Try starting with prepaid visa gift cards, use ukash if you have access to it, anything. Haven&#039;t been in the US for a while but I can tell you in Europe there is a plethora of prepaid methods available to you. In Europe, you can get paysafe cards with a pin in most gas stations or those vending machines that sell prepaid cellphone loading cards, if you take one of those and make your entrypoint virwox.com you&#039;ll be credited within hours at a wallet of your choosing. Granted, the exchange rate sucks, but who&#039;s doesn&#039;t?<br /><br />Don&#039;t let being too lazy to make a trip to the gas station or convenience store be your downfall. I know there are tumblers and washers out there, but seriously, do you really want to rely on some guy with a 2-bit website saying &quot;hey, I&#039;ll make you safe?&quot;

				johnwholesome , I agree. linking your real identity to Bitcoin is a BAD idea generally! It&#039;s still has a way too little user base to hide in the crowd and not attract attention.

				At minimum you should install a wallet on your own machine, on a Truecrypt encrypted drive.&nbsp; If you have another computer or a VM install another wallet.<br /><br />Transfer your BTC from whatever exchange you use to purchase them to your first wallet, then from your first wallet to your second wallet, then to SR.&nbsp; Leave your second wallet always empty of BTC.&nbsp; If you cannot do the second wallet, at least have one wallet on your machine. <br /><br />At least that way the trail will show only that you sent your BTC to your own personal wallet from the exchange, someone would have to be able to access your machine to get any further.&nbsp; You could then wipe the second wallet to kill the trail to SR.&nbsp; Either way there is no direct link from MTGOX or any other exchanger.<br />

				I used a USPS cashiers check to send money to a bitcoin exchanger.&nbsp; Is there any risk that the USPS saw where I was sending the money and flagged me as suspicious, just because of bitcoins, or am I being overly paranoid?&nbsp; (Note: I transfer the bitcoins through several wallets before to SR so that there&#039;s no link between me and SR.)<br /><br />Also, how do you encrypt your address?
