				Has anyone figured it out yet?<br /><br />I read all about it I understand why it&#039;s so easy to cancel a paypal order or even a credit card after the bitcoins are transferred but is there really no way to buy these (or something else you can convert into bitcoins) using a credit card (or even debit)? It would be so much easier to create &#039;single use&#039; credit cards with the exact amount I&#039;m spending and doing it all over the computer. I know it&#039;s not illegal but I&#039;m not liking getting recognized for buying &#039;online merchandise&#039; at the local walmart.<br /><br />I can&#039;t think of anything but I&#039;m sure if someone has an idea lots of people would jump on this instead of cash payments through bitinstant, I&#039;m guessing most of us don&#039;t deal with a lot of cash, I know I usually don&#039;t anymore.<br />Regards,<br />GZ.

				Dude, I reckon dealing with anything apart from cash is madness - everything else just leaves a trail that leads right to YOU. I would go so far as to say it&#039;s worth getting ripped off for the security aspect. Your choice of course - good luck!

				There are other methods such as bank transfer, moneypak, western union, and even paypal.<br />However, these are all extremely unsafe and you are likely to either be identified (which is definitely not what you want) or scammed (which is not quite as bad, but still bad).<br /><br />Use cash.
