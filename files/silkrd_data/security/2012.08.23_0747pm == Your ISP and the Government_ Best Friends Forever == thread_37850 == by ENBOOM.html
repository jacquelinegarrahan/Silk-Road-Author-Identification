				The feds and ISP&#039;s have a very comfy relationship. Especially one large US Crappy cable operator. Feds visiting and monitoring via passive splices and mirrored traffic to fed servers located directly at major intersection points and then fwd onto collection servers (which include raw packet dumps) is more common then you think, and much easier then you think. A lot is done via wink/nod and hey buddy can you help us with this. Being able to isolate your traffic (clearnet/normal) down to your cable modem/house is much more trivial then you think, sadly. Also well known that the feds operate large capacity exit nodes on Tor. The more they operate, and if they operate internal relays (sure they do) the easier it is for them to correlate traffic. Remember, &quot;they&quot; don&#039;t have to follow the rules, can be huge bully, and have very large reach.

				Wow, this video answers a whole set of questions I&#039;ve had for awhile.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the upload!&nbsp; &nbsp;Might investigate this speaker some more...<br /><br />I know a lot of people are busy, will only glance at the comments or watch a few minutes of the vid. Here&#039;s the key points I picked out or thought were most important. <br />But regardless, if you have the time:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WATCH THE VIDEO !!<br /><br />There&#039;s a bunch of things I don&#039;t have space for right here <br /><br /><br /><br />&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<br /><br />&gt;&gt; CONTENT WIRE-TAPS &lt;&lt;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Content&quot; taps mean LEO hears your phone calls, reads your text messages, and sees your internet network data. These taps require a &quot;super warrant,&quot; which are very difficult to obtain. Police must show probable cause, and prove they have tried other methods of getting the information they&#039;re seeking, before they can get this warrant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of these content-based wiretaps grows each year (all forms of wire-taps are). There were just over 500 granted in &#039;87 and 2500 granted in &#039;09. Wiretaps are almost exclusively granted for cases involving drugs (2000 of the 2500 taps from &#039;09 were related to drug investigations). 95% of content-taps are for cell phones, whereas other electronic device taps (such as pagers) are practically zero.&nbsp; &nbsp; Content-taps are apparently most heavily concentrated in&nbsp; &nbsp;NEW YORK&nbsp; and&nbsp; CALIFORNIA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as internet-taps go, LEO gets records from ISPs after-the-fact; instead of having a constant feed of your internet information dumping loads of information onto their system, they&#039;ll get lists of browser history, search queries, cache data, etc.&nbsp; From what I understand (the speaker was a little vague) getting your internet information still requires the &quot;super warrant.&quot; <br /><br /><br />&gt;&gt; NON-CONTENT WIRE-TAPS &lt;&lt; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-content tapping primarily consists of dialed phone numbers. They don&#039;t see or hear what was said, but they know that communication was made between two numbers. Non-content taps can also include your location with a special order.&nbsp; &nbsp;These wire-taps are ridiculously easy to get, the criteria simply being &quot;relevance to an ongoing investigation.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LOCATION TAPS are very accurate, using GPS-pings and cell-tower triangulation; LEO will see your location down to a few meters. These taps are described by law-enforcement insiders as &quot;routine.&quot; For instance, in murder cases, it&#039;s standard procedure to contact cell phone companies to get a list of all persons in the area during the time of death. In any kind of criminal investigation, these taps are regularly used to track the suspects&#039; known list of associates; &quot;It is common in location orders for the government to seek the location of the community of interest- that is, the location of the persons with whom the target communicates.&quot;&nbsp; - (Telecom Lawyer Al Gidari, House Judiciary Committee Hearing, May 2010).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The platforms LEO uses with these Location-taps are robust. In some cases, it can take as little as a few hours for tap-requests to be processed by cell phone companies and sent back to the police.&nbsp; Google even created an add-on to Google Earth for a foreign government&#039;s law enforcement, where typing in any phone number would bring up that device&#039;s pin-pointed location. Whether or not something so blatantly &quot;Big Brother&quot; is currently in use here in America is unknown.&nbsp; Even still, the sheer volume of these location-taps is overwhelming; Sprint alone had over 8 million requests in &#039;11. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Put 2 and 2 together:&nbsp; Remember that 2000 of the 2500 Content-taps in &#039;09 were related to drug investigations....&nbsp; The speaker didn&#039;t mention this, but I think we can safely assume there is a similar disproportion with Location-taps. LEO won&#039;t think twice about tracking&nbsp; YOU&nbsp; and&nbsp; ALL YOUR ASSOCIATES&nbsp; if you give them a reason to.&nbsp; Often times a group&#039;s movement can be enough to set off red flags with the police, leaving them only a few steps (and wire-taps) away from shutting the whole thing down. <br /><br />&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;<br /><br />hope this helps

(then they can go decrpyt all that stored info they have, and know what people did in the past.)<br /><br />Additionally, Google at least informs the public somewhat of how much information they willingfully surrender to the US and other governments, by occasionally publishing the number of requests they get for personal information disclosure.<br /><br />Regards.<br /><br />-Bromine

				not that this is the case in this instance...&nbsp; but i think about this.. <br /><br />Someone comes in here and posts a link.. That link is a clearnet. Then said user can tap that link and see all incoming traffic after they have posted link. NOW the only people that know the link are those people using said tor on said forums. NOT THAT THIS IS THE CASE here. but i do think about that.. How do u know its just not capturing your ip while they are bringing u in with some information u get excited about. who knows. Thanks for the write up anyway.&nbsp; I will check it out on a public wifi. <br /><br />they keep it forever wouldn&#039;t u.....

				Anyone in Australia want to comment whether they think this is plausible down under? Seeing as though one company (starts with T, ends with A) owns every data carrying piece of cable or wire in this country, I think it&#039;s completely possible for local LE to very easily gain access to data.<br /><br />The NBN that they have recently been raving about is not just for internet traffic either, it can handle millions of CCTV feeds in addition to everything else. I foresee a Big Brother-esque lifestyle coming to Oz. More-so. I recently discovered that in one of the localities I visit, the local council has installed over 300 invisible high definition CCTV cameras with some at head height (nice big high-res images of your face), in nearly every street.
