				Where would you hide your drug &amp; paraphernalia stash if you *HAD* to hide it outside away from your property?<br /><br />If you did this and were searched, you wouldn&#039;t need to worry about being busted.<br /><br />Some ideas I had were:<br /><br />----Bushes<br />----Under the ground, <br />----Under a rock<br />----Inside a tree trunk<br />----Under snow<br />----Under sand<br />----In a jar or airtight box in the middle of a lake/stream/swamp (you could memorize GPS coordinates and keep a GPS with you to find them) <br />----In a fake bird&#039;s nest in a random tree<br />----Inside a fake rock hidden under bushes or in tall grasses (you can buy these for house keys) <br />----In a fake hornets&#039; or bees&#039; nest that looks dead but real from the outside<br />----Inside a water proof container inside a drainage pipe<br />----Inside a hollowed out tree trunk with a secret compartment<br />----etc.<br /><br />I&#039;d most certainly appreciate your answer.

Watter tight preserve jars, tupperware&nbsp; or &quot;BDH bottles&quot; all make good waterproof stash boxes.<br /><br />The one thing I would say though is once you&#039;ve picked your areas (always pick a few and rotate!) don&#039;t tell them to anyone. Even as ideas. Don&#039;t even tell people that you do this.. All but one of the people I knew who lost stashes this way were to thieving scum not LE (the other one they turned up while he had it in the house. Throwing it out the window as they came through the door was not an effective way of keeping it from them&nbsp; ;) ).<br />

				Up in a tree. Make sure you water proof your stash.<br /><br />Get super creative and use the wilderness that is around YOU, to plot and plan a unique spot.<br />Consider..Will anyone see you? What times of a day (night/dark/both) can you have access? How big or small is your stash? What specific spots do you have in your area? Ex. A tree on your property that when you get above the trunk there is a nice caved out spot where the large branches begin to spread...(Only an Arial view could see this!! So someone would have to climb up and look down..ONLY WAY TO BE SEEN)

				Alright mate, I&#039;ve been doing this for years a lot of the dealers in my local area when they &quot;blow up&quot;/get bigger they tend to get noticed by law enforcement and then get raided and the pigs find lots of weed, coke, scales e.t.c and a shit ton of folded up money = dealer behind bars for a long time.<br /><br />at the end of the day a lot of people will tell you different things and &quot;good ideas&quot; but at the end of the day it&#039;s your stash and whether it&#039;s worth £/$100 or £/$1000, don&#039;t come up with some half-assed location or technique which ANYONE can find accidentally.<br /><br />You&#039;ve actually pretty much already got the best method I&#039;ve used successfully over the years:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9273.msg85015#msg85015">Quote from: Heyenezz on January 20, 2012, 07:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />----In a jar or airtight box in the middle of a lake/stream/swamp (you could memorize GPS coordinates and keep a GPS with you to find them) <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I use a slight variation where I vac seal the contents and place inside a BLACK (colour is v.important so it doesnt stick out) plastic bag, then find a local park/forest/nature spot...bury the shit, whip out phone, store GPS co-ordinates, (I also take a photo of the area so when I come back I can find it in a few seconds...but if your extra paranoid best not do this).<br /><br />Also try and make sure the spot is about 20-30 mins away from your home so nobody &quot;local&quot; sees wtf your doing digging around.<br /><br />I can assure you if you do this technique properly it works a treat.<br /><br />Up a tree = kids playing around can find/dog walkers can see easily.<br />bushes = people walking dogs..leads to dog having extended sniff of the bushes<br />under a rock = if there&#039;s a day of strong winds e.t.c say goodbye to your stash<br />fake bird nest = best hope a real bird doesn&#039;t land on it!<br />In a fake hornets&#039; or bees&#039; nest = whoever owns the land might call a pest controller..<br /><br />drainage pipe idea = not a bad idea..but can be quite bulky..which might lead to other problems<br />Inside a hollowed out tree trunk = also not a bad idea just make sure that tree is completely secluded..<br /><br />hope that helps!

The ones where i am, well, not all of them require full proof of identity. If you get busted with a kilo of *whatever*, you&#039;re screwed. If you get busted with a few grams, there isn&#039;t enough prima facie evidence to warrant searching out your private box which may or may not be in your name and may or may not contain said kilo.

				I don&#039;t think CCTV should be a big deal if you find a&nbsp; place like a field or forest or whatever to put your stash.<br /><br />Please understand that I&#039;m referring specifically to outdoor areas away from your property that are not often visited.
