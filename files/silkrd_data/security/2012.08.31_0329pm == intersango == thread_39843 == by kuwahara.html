				yes i did use sterling.&nbsp; The notice didn&#039;t really tell the whole picture.&nbsp; I have had to raise support tickets which they keep closing and it has been over a week now and I haven&#039;t got a refund or the bitcoins.<br /><br />They refuse to tell me whether I will even get these, let alone a date.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t thousands, but it was a 3 figure number - I can&#039;t afford to lose that and now I can&#039;t get anything here.

				As you can see from the date of my first post it has been over 2 months.&nbsp; Intersango have still refused to pay me my bitcoins or refund me or give me a reason for this.&nbsp; <br /><br />I raised a ticket, which the repeatedly close and I have to re-open, and they said they had banking issue and I just had to wait.&nbsp; Now they have insisted that I provide photo ID, which I refused at first and was told I would not get my money then...so I have been forced to provide ID and now they are saying that the resolution is not good enough quality!&nbsp; It is as clear as day and you can read the small print, let alone my name and picture on the ID.<br /><br />This has been months of stalling - they are basically thieves.<br /><br />AVOID

				Im on the same boat m8, iv got scunnered trying it been nearly 7 wks now since my deposit has went into limbo...<br /><br />but they did say they were waiting on the paper statements from metro bank so they could manully transfer any outstanding payments in our account... i recieved a message from them on my ticket, which has been opened and closed numerous times lol that they have now recieved the paper statements and my transfer&nbsp; should show up on my account in the next few days...<br /><br />fingers crossed, cos i do not know what to do anymore as i have explored and exhausted every avenue i can think to try and retrieve my money...<br /><br />hope you all get sorted guys...<br /><br />regards...
