				So i was talking to a friend that happens to work in UPS<br />no this ISNT the USPS (United States Postal Service)<br />But i thought i&#039;d share with you anyways,<br /><br />i was talking to said person and told me some pretty useful information. Atleast once a month there are drug dogs that scan the mail every once in a while. The insider told me that it isnt as common as some people think,(such as drug dogs coming in every day/week) Alot of the employees themselves find drugs ( he only mentioned weed) and the employees dont even report it, and instead just run off with the free weed they discovered lol. I guess the employee was able to smell inside the packaged, ripped it open and took off with it. He said that the UPS is a union system and alot of them could really care less about getting in trouble by their managers ( why some things dissapear often i guess)<br /><br />During the holidays of course, the mailing system get SLAMMED with mail, which makes many employees work 12 hour shifts just to deal with it. He explained to me that they pretty much the company has no time to bring in any drug dogs at all during the season, instead they just work their ass off to make sure all the mail is pushed out and sent to thier destination. <br /><br />i specifically asked him to make sure if they bring dogs during the season and his reply was no. <br />so one can only speculate they bring in the dogs as usual once or month or none at all. and even if they did bring the dogs, in his words &quot;the mail is their top priority&quot; so they can really careless about drugs. they are just working around the clock to push all the shit out and leave<br /><br />Food for thought eh?<br />again this ISNT the USPS this is the UPS. so i would assume that this is similar among many mailing systems

				I would imagine the USPS would be the same way. They are pretty low on money so I imagine it is easier to get stuff by during the christmas season.<br /><br />Hope those netherlands orders will go through.

				it&#039;s a well known fact that the weeks leading up to christmas are the best for shipping drugs, even through customs. Regarding dogs, I hear from an insider that USPS almost never have dogs checking domestic mail, customs is a different story though. Getting mail through customs is substantially harder than getting mail through the domestic inspectors, for a variety of reasons. I know people who import drugs via mail, including bulk, very frequently. So far only a few of them have been arrested, and they had generally imported several dozen packages, including some packs with half kilo - kilo payloads in them before they ended up getting fucked. Weed is the most dangerous thing to get, it has a substantially higher risk of interception. Getting pills past customs seems to be significantly harder than getting anything other than weed through.
