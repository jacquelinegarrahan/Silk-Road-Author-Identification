				privateinternetaccess.com<br /><br />They are serious about your security, and don&#039;t keep logs. They allow up to 3 VPN connections on a single VPN account (that is high). So you can hook up your computer and your phone, and something else if you want. They allow you to pay anonymously with bitcoins, only requiring that you provide an email address so that they can send you the login information. <br /><br />That is the company I use. I have 2 VPNs with them. I am not connected to the company in any way. I do endorse them.

				+1 for privateinternetaccess.com. I just got an account with them last week and so far so good. Their prices are very reasonable too. Check out this article on torrent freak about what VPN services log IP addresses. http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/

				JezuzWazaMushroom, so HideMyAss is better than privateinternetaccess because they did turn in a hacker to authorities, while privateinternetaccess has done nothing of the sort? I don&#039;t understand that line of reasoning at all.<br /><br />HideMyAss kept sufficient information to convict that hacker. Privateinternetaccess doesn&#039;t keep logs and uses shared IPs, so there is obscurity in numbers. HideMyAss you need to pay by a method that could lead back to you and so on. HideMyAss shouldn&#039;t be keeping any logs at all.

				nmac, how about TOR -&gt; VPN proxy? You start with TOR but your data transmissions are encrypted end to end from VPN to your computer as it goes through TOR. And the VPN will never know your originating address.<br /><br />I would say that is the safest option.

How can you trust a VPN provider short of being given root access to their server and looking at the logs? Even then, how can you be sure they don&#039;t start logging as soon as you leave? VPN providers can see their whole network. They can see your IP address and the sites you&#039;re visiting, if they choose to look. That they don&#039;t look is just a promise.<br /><br />The whole point of Tor is to send your circuits over independently operated relays, so nobody has a view of the whole network. The entry guard operator can see your IP address but doesn&#039;t know which site you&#039;re visiting. The exit node operator can see which site you&#039;re visiting, but doesn&#039;t know your IP address. In the case of a hidden service, nobody knows which site you&#039;re visiting. That&#039;s not a promise. That&#039;s privacy by design. <br /><br />Furthermore, what&#039;s the point of hiding your IP address from PayPal unless you&#039;re using a stolen account?

				On the topic of multiple devices over the same VPN... I&#039;m assuming it would be unsafe and not recommended to use the same VPN account for mixing personal (real ID) and SR purposes. Overkill, or justified paranoia?

				The number one rule about VPN&#039;s is that you should assume they are all entirely compromised. The second rule is that you should keep in mind asking for a VPN on a site like SR is essentially asking the feds if they would like your IP address. That said, JAP seems to be above average as far as VPN providers go. They will immediately start logging as soon as they get a court order to log traffic to a particular site or from a particular user, but they give you two or three hop cascades so usually two different court orders in two different countries are required. And they are very strict about not logging anything until they get a court order forcing them to do so. That is pretty much the best you can hope for. <br /><br />Or you could go search around for some sketchy Russian service and buy a VPS from them. Personally I would be more inclined to buy a VPS to exit through if I wanted to have an exit IP address that didn&#039;t identify me as someone using an anonymity service. VPN services have their IP addresses on many of the same block lists as Tor exit nodes do.

				never was entirely sure about germany, but i know some russian datacenters are as corrupt as they come.<br /><br />a lot of carding and CP sites were hosted on bulletproof russian servers, but they&#039;e not cheap. making your own VPN on a hardened linux server that you rooted or is BP would be the only way you could trust it, instead of putting your faith and identity in the hands of a stranger because it was cheap, convenient, and made a lot of false promises. perhaps make a script that re-directs all logs to /null? :P
