				I have tried to transfer out a couple thousand over the past week. Normally, its transferred asap. But, these last two are taking forever. the response that I&#039;ve got from Mt. gox is that they cant transfer money until there is enough money in the account. WHAT???? They also said that there are a lot of people transferring money out and it may take some time.. <br /><br />This isnt my problem. My money is my money. If i want it now, I should get it now. This makes me&nbsp; nervous. it reminds me of what happened in the great depression. people withdrew all their money until there were no more. If they are having issues completing withdrawal requests, then I suggest they put a limit on the amount that can be withdrawn in a day or whatever. This is unacceptable...

				I feel your pain. Only I&#039;m having troubles getting money IN B$ (!)<br /><br />Truly isn&#039;t as easy to be anonymous in today&#039;s society as most people seem to think.<br /><br />Just today, I had 4 separate ID requests over trivial matters. <br /><br />As for your MtGox problems, it sucks but the supply and demand of Bitcoin is so volatile that I would guess this is a periodic episode of market madness. <br /><br />Just gotta wait it out I guess. Suggest Milk of Magnesia for the butterflies (works for me :) )<br /><br />I think Bitcoin badly needs some manner of derivatives market to help dampen down the volatility. <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that B$ would be less volatile with a more diversified base of products/services using the currency. But that&#039;ll take time. Right now, B$ is similar to a 3rd world country currency whose industry is mostly agri cash crops and so their currency really reflects the price of bananas etc.<br /><br />Similarly with B$, except I think the Silk Road is the main thing backing the currency. A &#039;Weed&#039; monetary standard instead of bananas. Not sure how much of our business is a % of Bitcoin economy, but it&#039;s got to be considerable.
