				I never realized that there are over 2 billion ips simultaneously talking to your computer, collecting bits of information and data, and sending them to places without your consent. Places like advertising agencies, anti piracy agencies, government agencies, random corporations, universities, research facilities and to that giant data collection center in Utah. My theory asserts that the NSA data collection building will be used in conjunction with quantum computing to predict the actions of every single person who uses the internet with an uncanny degree of accuracy.&nbsp; The future of privacy and security for windows and clearnet users is almost seemingly non existent.

				Not every IP blocked by Peerblock is &quot;bad&quot;. I&#039;d say like 90% of those IP ranges are completely innocuous while about 5% actually belong to organizations looking to report your downloads. Peerblock is still a must for torrenting, as its overly-inclusive blocklists actually do a good job at catching most of the net ranges used by intellectual property protection bots. Just don&#039;t assume that every blocked connection is an attempt to track you down or harm your computer.

				Does it not block this info from going out if we are using Vidalia as security to bounce our IP&#039;s while on Silk Road??&nbsp; Sorry guys im very computer illiterate and my friend whom has had an account here for months is helping me but i just want to be safe as possible not to screw anything up for me or anyone else..Thanks

				I am posting this just so that I can find this thread quickly the next time someone asks me whats so dangerous about using windows to access SR.<br /><br />But Honestly, I was always more suspicious of mac doing this kind of stuff. <br />But if windows is doing it, than I guarantee you that mac is too.

If you are noticing strange open ports on your machine which are communicating with suspicious IPs on the bluetack/peerblock lists, that is certainly unusual and warrants further investigation. Perhaps a rootkit scan?<br /><br />Many of these malicious &quot;anti-p2p&quot; entities (along with advertisers, etc) change the IP blocks used by their bots pretty often. That&#039;s why there are soo many netblocks on these lists. They want to cover as many IPs as possible, that way it&#039;s harder for them to slip through the cracks. Lots of those list entries are simply orphaned over from previous edits of the list as well, and should be removed because the netblocks are now used by legit companies.&nbsp; Try enabling HTTP blocking and browsing the clearnet. You&#039;ll see that lots of plain, ordinary web servers are blocked, and no, it&#039;s not because your computer silently uploads your porn collection to amazon.com. lol
