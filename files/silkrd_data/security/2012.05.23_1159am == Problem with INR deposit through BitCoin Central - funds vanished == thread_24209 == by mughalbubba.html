				BitCoin Central are listed on the Silk Road site as being the only site that handle Indian Rupee deposits. If you join up on BitCoin-Central.net there are clear instructions on how to deposit Indian Rupees through an ICICI Bank account in Chandigarh (named Minamar India. <br /><br />I deposited a fairly substantial sum according to the instructions and the transfer went through. A day later I checked with BitCoin-Central to see how long it would take to register. They replied that they no longer had a relationship with the bank account I had paid money into and that I should cancel my transfer. It was too late and so far I have had no response from the company and no help from either BitCoin-Central or Silk Road. The instructions for depositing INR into this account are still up on the BitCoin-Central website. <br />What is going on? It seems that I have been swindled but im not exactly sure by who. I had the impression BitCoin-Central were reputable. I was following their instructions and i lost a lot of money. Any help or advice from anyone appreciated.
