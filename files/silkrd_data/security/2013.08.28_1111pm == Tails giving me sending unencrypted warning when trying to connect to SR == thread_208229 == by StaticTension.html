				I&#039;ve never used Tails before so I tried it out and when trying to connect to SR I put in my login details and then I get a warning saying that the information I&#039;m about to send is unencrypted and that a third party could potentially see it.<br /><br />&nbsp;Is this normal? Also the other thing is why is it that by default on something that is touted as a safe portable OS is Scripts enabled on Iceweasel by default and Javascript?

So this OS that I&#039;m supposed to trust my freedom is not aware of how Javascript that would comprise Tails anonymity? That seems like a vary laxed attitude to me considering recent events. Some of you might say well they don&#039;t update their site or w/e but how hard is it to change a line on a website? <br /><br />As far as I knew the main disadvantage of using Tails was a lack of persisent entry guards for Tor but the more I&#039;m look at it seems kinda well not that great.

				Thx for the reply...<br /><br />After mucking around on their website that&#039;s what I figured as well and you make a good point about the target audience that Tails developers had in mind. I&#039;m not sure if there would be a way to create a persisent volume that would keep info for static tor entry guards and enable it early on in the boot sequence. I just got into Linux myself a week ago but I&#039;d think if your intent was to customize Tails source code you&#039;d prolly be better off making your own hardened Gentoo live distro and add the stuff you want on it. That would be my ideal choice but at the current time my lack of knowledge is putting that idea on the back burner. I&#039;m just taking about if I need to use TOR when out and about, would never really on it for a main option... those twitchy entry guards are sketchy. I read a news article about a week ago saying that half of the entry guards are owned by intelligence agencies..I&#039;ll try to dig it up but then again I never believe media but in those rare times they can be right. Better safe than sorry&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />
