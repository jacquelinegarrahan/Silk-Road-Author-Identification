				I understand that windows can be unsafe for us SR users so I&#039;ve decided to switch over to linux. My questions are: 1) Which specific version of linux is recommended for ease of use and anonymity? 2) Once I have linux up and running, how should I proceed with cleaning out and deleting windows? 3) Can I transfer my private and public keys from my windows PGP software to my new linux software? 4) I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve overlooked some aspect of this process, so any other advice would be greatly appreciated.

				Good for you, its a big change &amp; it may take some time to get used to but you won&#039;t look back. <br />Linux is so much better than windows, safer, more modifiable &amp; with better (often free) software.<br /><br />Which version, or distro, of Linux to use is up to you, the most common is Ubuntu, but others are Mint, Fedora, Debian, Knoppix, SUSE, Liberte. Seriously there&#039;s loads all with different features &amp; focuses. <br /><br />Your best bet is to search for linux distros, there&#039;s a ew sites which rate then &amp; discuss features &amp; pros/cons. Find a few you like the look of and download a bootable live version, copy this to dvd or usb &amp; boot it up so you can have a play &amp; try them out. <br /><br />Once you&#039;ve got one you like &amp; have read a bit about how to use it - and have backed up any windows stuff you want to keep - reboot your hard drive. This will delete everything. Once that&#039;s done boot up your linux distro for good as your new operating system.<br /><br />You can transfer your public &amp; private keys from windows pgp, I forget the name of the windows files though, you can find it easily enough with a google search, then you can just import that file into your linux PGP.

				I should have mentioned that I&#039;m using an older machine, circa 2006-7 if I had to guess. When I looked at the page for Ubuntu, it looked like something that might not run on the centrino processor I&#039;ve got. Unfortunately I don&#039;t know the specs so for now I&#039;m looking for something that is pretty bare bones.<br />Edit: I just checked and it looks like I&#039;ve got an Intel Pentium M processor. 1.60GHz. Will the 32-bit version of Ubuntu run on this?

That way you can try it out first to see if it runs on your hardware.

				I wouldn&#039;t be too quick to get rid of Windows. Linux isn&#039;t that secure if the person setting it up doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. Start out running it as a live cd and when you figure out which one you want to learn, maybe run it in VMWare Player or dual boot. Learn how to do basic stuff like install and configure programs, set up a firewall, and maybe compile kernel modules before you dump Windows. At that point, you can run Windows in VMWare if you ever need it for specific programs. (I occasionally have to use it for Solidworks.)<br /><br />As for your hardware, I would think that Ubuntu would work though it probably won&#039;t be fast. I doubt it will be any slower than Windows though. Burn a live cd and see.

				There really isn&#039;t any minimum processor.&nbsp; As long as it&#039;s something more recent than a first generation pentium, you shouldn&#039;t have any problems other than speed.&nbsp; Ubuntu is pretty heavy and designed for features instead of efficiency, but honestly, I really wouldn&#039;t recommend using anything else until you get a feel for Linux.&nbsp; Trying to use unfriendly distributions can be really painful if you don&#039;t know how they work.<br /><br />I mean just getting something to print can be a full day task if you don&#039;t know how to do it.<br />

				if you want anonymity then get a distro specific for such things,&nbsp; tails or liberte <br />tails is updated about every 6 weeks now, both have minimum requirements.<br />just remember daily use on these distros is limited and slow, they are for anonymous work, nothing more.<br />for something a little more complete but not as taxing as ubuntu which isnt gonna run for shit on your computer btw.&nbsp; try lubuntu&nbsp; &nbsp;a lite version.<br />&nbsp;

				Just use a TAILS live cd.&nbsp; You can convert it to boot off a USB stick with a program, or maybe they offer a download for it, I dunno.&nbsp; You can go that route just fine.<br /><br />Deleting ANY trace of all of those is going to be... involved.&nbsp; Manual registry editing, which is overkill.&nbsp; PGP isn&#039;t illegal -- honestly, unless you&#039;re in a fascist country, you have nothing to worry about if they find that on your computer.&nbsp; Also, any USB key you plug in while Windows is on is recorded.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much of it is, probably just the serial number, but that&#039;s available if someone pokes around (it doesn&#039;t really matter, but just FYI, ya know).<br /><br />Deleting the Tor browser bundle is good enough; it&#039;ll be basically clean.&nbsp; The hard drive space will be overwritten and lost forever in short order.<br />

				I&#039;ve always had Tor and PGP on a thumb drive. I was under the impression that Windows somehow recorded everything you do on it, i.e. if I ever got into serious trouble, LE could take my computer and see that I&#039;d been logging into SR on a weekly basis for months, even without having the thumb drive Tor and PGP are stored on, I&#039;m not dealing or ordering large quantities so this is all probably overkill, but I just want to know that, worst case scenario, there won&#039;t be any way to prove I&#039;ve used SR. Assuming the the thumb drive hasn&#039;t been compromised, that is.

				Are you selling on SR?&nbsp; Because if you aren&#039;t, no one in their right mind is going to waste the time and money to hire real forensics experts to rip your computer apart looking for every incriminating piece of evidence they can find.&nbsp; SR is not illegal.&nbsp; The items for sale through it are -- you&#039;re fine if you aren&#039;t caught for possession or trafficking.

In the meantime Ive got an old set of instructions I wrote for a dude back in the newbie forums that I&#039;ll paste. That should get you going untill I get some motivation. <br /><br />&quot;Firstly let&#039;s explain virtualization.. go and download/install a program called virtualbox. this program once installed will allow you to build virtual machines.... or computers within computers&nbsp; &nbsp; A virtualization program essentially divides up your computers hardware to allow for multiple operating systems to run in their own sand-boxed environment side by side.. <br /><br />Go to Liberte&#039; linux homepage and you will see a few download options, choose the &quot;open virtualization format&quot; or otherwise known as the ova format. Allow it to download from sourceforge.<br /><br />Open virtualbox and go to &quot;file&quot; then &quot;import appliance&quot;.. this will open an import wizard.<br /><br />Select &quot;choose&quot; and find the liberte ova file you just downloaded.. once you&#039;ve done this just hit next.<br /><br />A list of details and config settings will open, just go ahead and leave all of the defaults for now.. next button<br /><br />With any luck it will now assemble your new machine and show it in virtualbox&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Awesome, select your new machine and hit &quot;start&quot;. you should see a window open and beautiful text start filling up your screen as the first time boot gets underway.. After a moment the text will ask you to enter a password.. this password is what encrypts the persistence and allows you to login so make sure this is one of those &quot;important&quot; passwords that you won&#039;t forget.<br /><br />Aaaand there you should be! <br /><br />If you have any more questions let me know.. maybe later I&#039;ll write up a Live usb guide&quot; <br /><br />

				I tend to think of it as a virtual &quot;machine&quot; (as in a virtual computer) that runs on top of the real hardware and operating system the same way any program does.&nbsp; Except virtual machines implement entire virtual machines (big surprise, right).&nbsp; They provide a layer between the hardware and some arbitrary software, which is usually an operating system.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it lets you run an entire second operating system right on your primary one&#039;s desktop.&nbsp; If it helps you picture it, the interface is almost identical to a remote desktop session with a ton of extra configuration options; and it&#039;s not remote, it&#039;s on your computer and you can have as many of them as you have the space for.&nbsp; You can also do cool stuff like save the entire machine state as a snapshot and load it up later (same way you can with console game emulators).&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of neat stuff to play with if you get into that sort of thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they&#039;re slower than running on the hardware directly (the virtual machine layer in the middle translating stuff is a lot of extra overhead).&nbsp; They&#039;re also not perfect.&nbsp; They&#039;re amazingly good, but graphics are one of the things that don&#039;t really get emulated properly; for example, I can&#039;t even enable the Air theme (the transparent glassy one) in a Windows VM.&nbsp; The graphics glitch too much.<br /><br />If you want to play with one (VirtualBox used to be free, I assume it still is), go to https://www.virtualbox.org/<br />

				yeah i thought vm was the way to run tails and liberte since tails gives the warning about no vm on shutdown.&nbsp; but upon boot in a vm tails gives a warning about using it in a vm and about the host machine spying on you, so your secure vm is only as secure as your host machine :)<br />but vm is great to use windows programs in linux, better than wine.<br />and yes, your machine will work fine with tails i run it on a pos netbook like dual core 1ghz or some shit, my phone has more ram and processing speed.

				Just select to use host only routing with virtual box, the default virtual network adapters internal address is 192.168.56.1 <br /><br />configure Torrc for Tor on the host :<br /><br />SocksListenAddress 192.168.56.1<br />SocksPort 9100<br /><br />after the virtual machine with that network adapter is started the virtual network adapter comes into existence, and at this point you can launch Tor. Now from inside the VM you can configure applications to use 192.168.56.1:9100 for SOCKS connections. Now it is not possible for the virtual machine to access the internet other than via the Tor on the host, and additionally even if the VM is rooted by a hacker they only get an internal IP address and not your external IP address. They are also kept away from Tor entirely, as it runs on the host, and so they cannot see your entry guards to deanonymize you by fucking with Tor.<br /><br />Thanks to the browser bundle bullshit you will need to either compile Tor Browser (pain in the ass) in the VM independently of its bundled components, or you can configure browser bundle Tor in the VM to use Socks5Proxy 192.168.56.1:9100 which causes the Tor in the VM to connect via Tor on the host, this is enough for an internet connection and for the bundled Tor Browser to launch, then you can either use Tor Via Tor (which can have unintended effects on anonymity when connecting to clear net but shouldn&#039;t have risk of being detrimental if you only connect to hidden services) , or after Tor Browser pops up you can configure it manually to use the Tor on the host. But you still need the Tor in the VM running even if you don&#039;t use it for anything, because Tor Project cares more about hand holding noobs than they do offering independent tools for experts to configure into superior to default setups.

Your opinions, ladies and gentlemen.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Like SelfSovereignty, I can&#039;t really comment on the different between the two because I&#039;ve only used VMWare, and I use Player (the free one), not Workstation. I would probably give VirtualBox a try if I wasn&#039;t already committed to VMWare. I can tell you a bit about VMWare though.<br /><br />About the networking, you have some options as to which way you can do it. There&#039;s a NAT mode where the host operating system basically routes to the guest operating system which doesn&#039;t have an actual IP address on the network. Then there&#039;s bridge mode where the guest operating system has a separate IP address to connect directly to the network with the same network card. The interface for the guest OS will be called vmnet1 or something like that but it&#039;s pretty much linked directly to the same hardware. In either case, the firewall on the host OS will affect data originating from or destined for the guest OS and it&#039;s easy to make rules specifically affecting that traffic if you want. None of my firewall rules specify interfaces (though now that I think about it, I should probably add one to allow all traffic on the loopback interface) so Linux and Windows are basically behind the same firewall in addition to the DD-WRT firewall on my router. I think there&#039;s a third network option too but I can&#039;t think of it right now.<br /><br />I do really like VMWare. It is resource intensive since, after all, you are running two operating systems at the same time so you have to have a pretty good rig and you may have to use an older version of Windows than you would otherwise be able to use on that system. The program is pretty magnificent though. You can set how much resources the guest OS uses, such as memory and processor cores. It can attach cd-roms and USB devices directly to the guest OS or set an image file to be emulated as a drive. You can set it so that it maps a given directory in the host OS to a drive in the guest OS. The desktop can either be in full screen mode (you may forget it&#039;s even running in Linux) or in windowed mode. It doesn&#039;t have the seamless mode that SelfSovereignty mentions but he also says he never uses it anyway... When installing a new OS, for the more common ones you can choose what you&#039;re installing and it will automatically configure certain things for you although the lack of such an option didn&#039;t make it hard to install and use Haiku. You are very unlikely to run into a problem of an application not wanting to install and run unlike with Wine.<br /><br />One bad thing about VMWare though is that when the 3.2 kernel came out, it didn&#039;t support it for several months so you were stuck with either using an older kernel or doing without VMWare. I was rather annoyed that it took them so long to fix the issue. That&#039;s the one issue I&#039;ve ever had and right now, it&#039;s working fine.

				From a user friendliness and feature rich point of view, VMware is the winner. I am pretty sure VMware has a seamless mode that is actually seamless, versus Virtualboxes shit seamless mode that essentially just makes the desktop transparent / removes it (but still has its own application bar etc instead of integrating with the hosts).<br /><br />From a security point of view Virtualbox is superior, primarily because it is open source and VMware is not.

				Wow.&nbsp; VMWare is *that* closed source -- I mean the kernel modules don&#039;t even get compiled on the host OS?&nbsp; Even NVIDIA drivers are compiled for the local kernel... whenever I upgrade my kernel, I just have VirtualBox recompile its modules and it works every time regardless of the version.&nbsp; I mean sometimes I have to tell it where the source headers are or something, but it&#039;s surprisingly easy.&nbsp; It can also do everything you listed, snailgod, except for the mapping a folder to a folder -- it may be able to do that, but I don&#039;t know how.&nbsp; My host drive appears as a network attached drive in the guest OS.<br /><br />Thanks for the info kmfkewm; I&#039;ll get that up and running the next time I feel like playing around :)<br />
