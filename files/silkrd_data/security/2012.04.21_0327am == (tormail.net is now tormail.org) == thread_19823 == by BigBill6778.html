				Yeah that&#039;s what I got too? I&#039;m going to approach with caution! safe-mail.net I heard was bad too? and after the hushmail thing from The Farmers Market. I&#039;m going to be more careful. And before Pharmville left they said to me they didn&#039;t trust countermail either. Any safe email out here anymore?

				&quot;Dear Tor Mail User,<br /><br />Early this morning, April 20, our domain registrar nic.ru suspended the domain<br />tormail.net.<br />The reason they gave is because they require us to submit ID documents to them,<br />apostilized and certified by the Russian Embassy.<br />We are unable to do this to protect our own identity, and also this request is very<br />unusual and suspicious.<br />They have further refused to unlock the domain and allow us to transfer it to a<br />different registrar.<br /><br />We have filed a complaint with ICANN as per the domain transfer rules, they are not<br />allowed to do this.<br />As it is the weekend, we probably wont get a response until next week, and even to<br />transfer a domain normally takes about a week to be completed.<br />For this reason, at the earliest we can hope for is to have the domain back within<br />two weeks.<br />It is possible the domain is gone for good and it may not be possible to get it back.<br /><br />Up until two months ago, the domain was registered with a USA company, Moniker domains.<br />They were great and we had no problems with them, but with the recent domain<br />seizures we decided to move the domain offshore.<br />It appears this was a big mistake, the Russian providers are much worse!<br /><br />The chances of getting the domain back does not look good, and even if we get it<br />back it will take a long time.<br />For that reason we have registered a new domain name tormail.org and will use that<br />one to continue the service.<br />If we do get the tormail.net domain back, we will change back to using that one.<br /><br />Every user who had a @tormail.net address now has the same address @tormail.org<br />Your new email address is: xxxxxx@tormail.org<br /><br />You may continue to use the @tormail.net addresses on the Tor Mail website, but they<br />will not work with external services.<br />You should quickly change the email addresses at any services you are using.<br />If we get the tormail.net domain back, both addresses will be able to reach you.<br /><br />If you are using our webmail service, (squirrelmail or roundcube) no changes are<br />necessary.<br />If you are using thunderbird or other SMTP software, you will need to change the<br />&quot;From&quot; address to your new tormail.org address or you will be unable to send mail.<br /><br />This message has also been posted at our hidden service, so you can verify its<br />validity.<br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br /><br />Sorry for the inconvenience, but we were taken by surprise by this and had no time<br />to avoid it.<br />Admin.&quot;<br /><br />- cut &#039;n paste from the global email.<br />

				- we have no choice, the tormail.net clearly isn&#039;t working<br />- the registration details for the .net versus .org are completely different, they are purposely anon / invalid but totally diff which doesn&#039;t help.<br />- the fact that &#039;admin&#039; sent a global email to every mailbox supposedly and obviously has admin access to the existing system -no other evidence to go on.<br /><br /><br />
