				Is it a risk to stay logged in when not needed?<br /><br />Noob question, I know.<br /><br />In addition, loading a picture that has been stripped of meta tags, is it safe to load from USB Stick?<br /><br />Thank you.

				Its not safe to stay logged in in the sense that someone could see your screen and wonder about the SR page with pictures of weed, heroin &amp; the like on it. <br /><br />Other than that I&#039;m not aware of any security concerns. It may be using up TOR bandwith unecessarily though. Possibly someone with nore knowledge can comment on this.<br /><br />Posting a pic should be fine so long as it&#039;s been stripped of metatags.

				I bought computers specifically for being with you all. no info has ever been input outside of Tor related. <br /><br />I guess my misunderstanding of Big Brother had me thinking a prolonged visit would create exposure. <br /><br />Thanks

				No matter how hard you try to cover your tracks, in teh end theres to many ends to hold together. Use the best practice methods of: encrypted drives, vpn with tor, then its outta your hands, its all in the packaging of your vendor

				I have always wondered about this and actually have put a considerable amount of thought into it, so fuck it I&#039;ll share what I think and you all are welcome to add on to what I&#039;ve mentioned below.<br /><br />1. By staying logged into tor, and specifically SR under your account-if a raid were conducted upon your premises then LE would have your entire SR account (current orders -trafficking-, unencrypted messages -conspiracy-, and your past buys -mail fraud-) which is, always has been and always will be a constant fear of mine until I get off my lazy ass and buy a cheap comp. setup to run strictly liberte on.&nbsp; I even stay in the furthermost point away from all points of entry at my residence so if by chance this were to happen, I&#039;d have 10 or so seconds to close out of tor which would be enough time to make sure they can&#039;t get on.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is why it is important, if available, to use a location to ship to that you do not reside in, don&#039;t use TOR and know there aren&#039;t any illicit substances kept there.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. After some reading done here on the boards, I think the overall consensus is that your ISP has the ability to monitor your TOR activity.&nbsp; Not what your viewing, per se, but just that your on the network.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ve also read that if you use a tor bridge, you can get around that completely but I&#039;m not too sure about this.&nbsp; If anybody has any more information about this, or how to go about doing it, you&#039;ll get a +1 from me if you can elaborate a bit more.&nbsp; It may raise suspicion if your logged into the network daily for hours at a time-although TOR is completely legal, its known for people using it for things they shouldn&#039;t be (legally).<br /><br />Just my .2BTC-I like this thread, lets keep this discussion going for a while.

I don&#039;t think it works for any lengthy period of time.&nbsp; More like &quot;hop on, post the tweet, get the fuck off,&quot; kind of stuff.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t really looked into it very seriously though... so I could be wrong.&nbsp; Still, to the best of my knowledge, your answer is &quot;no, it is not possible to completely hide the fact that you&#039;re using Tor.&quot;

				As far as being worried about tying up the SR, or adding to the load on the servers.&nbsp; Just staying logged in, and not doing anything does nothing. It only uses the servers when you send a command. Going to another screen, etc. You could think you&#039;re logged on, because you see the same screen from across the room. Then you go to change screens, and you get that &quot;cannot connect&quot; message. <br /><br />The screen you left it on is just your computers memory holding that image. <br /><br />So as far as being worried that you&#039;re tying up the server. No worries there. <br /><br />You&#039;re only &quot;using&quot; the network, when you send a command. (Send or Receive obviously)
