				Hello SR community,<br /><br />Newbie here, as you can probably see&nbsp; :). Been on SR for about 10 days (still haven&#039;t bought anything).<br />I have been doing a lot of reading on the forum and on the wiki as to what are the best practices in using SR (anonymity, bitcoins, etc)<br />and have come across many different alternatives regarding every aspect.<br />The thing is, I am a perfectionist (I tend to over analyze everything trying to come up with THE best solution, which is generally pretty tiring).<br />So I decided to take a different approach to the matter, which I believe will also help future members.<br />I ask you, each one personally, how do you do it and if it has been successful.<br /><br />For example:&nbsp; I am from *place* (If you don&#039;t feel comfortable in disclosing the country you live in, the continent will be more than enough).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been on SR for *time period*.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am using *this* OS.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep all SR related information in *place*<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I buy my bitcoins from *site*, using *credit/debit card, coupons, wire transfer, etc*<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I then do *this* in order to erase the trail back to me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have ordered *that many* times and it has worked for me (I haven&#039;t got caught).<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />TL;DR : I kindly ask you to to share the way you do business on SR as the example above.<br /><br />Feel free to add anything you consider important that&#039;s not in the above example.<br /><br />Thank you for your time. I hope this thread helps in not making new users paranoid&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Also, nice to meet you good people, providing us with drugs and shit&nbsp; 8)

				I dont know, I am trying to figure that out still. If your search these questions an look in forums you can zero in on a good question. Also I don&#039;t understand why you would ask these questions and expect an answer. Even a dingbat like me thinks this is weird.&nbsp; :-*

				I&#039;m not going to share personal information, but I can tell you about the way I access the deep web:<br /><br />I use Linux Ubuntu. It is the best OS in my opinion because it is open source, the developer cannot secretly sneak in any back doors to spy on me. With Windos and Mac, theoretically this is possible.<br /><br />With Linux, the risk of a virus is way smaller. And it&#039;s compatible with many security software. GPG is installed by default on many Linux distributions, just like many hash function and shredding commands.<br /><br />I store as little information as possible, but for the things I do I use encryption. My HDD has full disk encryption, and for USB sticks I use TrueCrypt.
