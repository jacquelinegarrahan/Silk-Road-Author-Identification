				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Until trying to do this I considered myself fairly technically competent. I was obviously mistaken. I&#039;ve seen the 2x speed screencast by GPG tools and I can copy all the stuff they do which seems like a decent start. <br /><br />Here is the link for anyone who may need it: https://www.gpgtools.org/screencast.html<br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure what to do though.<br /><br />Do I copy someones public key and put it into the OpenPGP program or what? I&#039;ve been at this for a few hours and I&#039;m completely lost and super frustrated. I know this is very basic but for some reason I just can&#039;t grasp it. I searched the forum for a step by step guide but had no luck finding one. Will someone outline the steps I need to follow to send an encrypted message please?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				Copy/paste someone&#039;s public key into the program TextEdit. Select the key. Go to TextEdit&gt;Services&gt;Import Key.<br /><br />Write your message in TextEdit. Select it. TextEdit&gt;Services&gt;Encrypt. Choose the key of the person you are writing. Do NOT sign. Add to recipients. Encrypt.<br /><br />Copy/paste the encrypted message from TextEdit to the message field on SR. Done!

				I&#039;m certainly no expert when it comes to encryption, but it sounds to me like the program you&#039;re using is pretty lame and uses the email address to actually keep track of recipients.&nbsp; So no email address, no entry for the recipient maybe?<br /><br />Try another PGP program.

				Oh, then I don&#039;t see how that could be the problem.&nbsp; Imports fine and shows up in my list with gpg in Linux, BTW.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a 1024 bit key, which is a bit weak.&nbsp; and it has no comment.&nbsp; And no email.&nbsp; And the username is a domain (aanbod-live.com ???)<br /><br />Who the Hell gave you this key?&nbsp; It&#039;s awfully... weak, in a few different senses of the word. Are you sure you want to interact with this guy?

				He is a vendor here with numerous positive reviews and great prices so I would like to interact with him. ;)<br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t recall his name and I&#039;m unable to access the marketplace right now. Once the marketplace is back up I will mention these issues to him and maybe he will fix them. <br /><br />It&#039;s unfortunate I&#039;m unable to find the resolution to this. I did pull up his information and saw the key was weaker than others I have imported.&nbsp; When you imported his key does anything show up on the &quot;subkey&quot; tab? It is empty for me while all the others I&#039;ve imported have data there.

				Nope, nothing. I&#039;ve seen a couple of other keys without that, but I&#039;m not knowledgeable enough about encryption schemes to know exactly what that means.&nbsp; I *think* it means that they can&#039;t sign something (as in sign it to guarantee it really did come from them)... but I&#039;m none too sure about that.<br /><br />I&#039;ll say this. Of the few vendors I&#039;ve seen who don&#039;t have a subkey, only one (out of 3) I&#039;d do business with. That one is spectacular to do business with, as it so happens... but the others I wouldn&#039;t buy from unless I were hard up or had no other options.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />... it&#039;s also retarded to not use your fucking name as your key name. I mean seriously, that&#039;s just silly. Doesn&#039;t he want people to do business with him?

				Thanks for the help. I&#039;ve run into another issue. I think it&#039;s pretty simple and I&#039;m hoping someone can help me out.<br /><br />I have an encoded message and the public key which has been imported into PGP Keychain access. When I highlight the message in text edit and choose &quot;decrypt&quot; the encrypted message vanishes and no clean text replaces it. Text edit is empty. <br /><br />Would someone please write out the correct procedure please?<br /><br />Thanks

				You&#039;re using the wrong key.&nbsp; The public key encrypts the message so that the only person who can decrypt it is the one who has the private key.&nbsp; Generally, that&#039;s the guy who gave you the public key, since otherwise getting an encrypted message from you won&#039;t do him any good w/o that private key. :)<br /><br />And no, you cannot decrypt your own messages after you&#039;ve encrypted it.&nbsp; Once it&#039;s encrypted, only the guy with the private key can decrypt it.&nbsp; To be clear, that means no one should ever, ever have your private key.&nbsp; If you ever make a key pair, you pass out the public key like vendors do, and guard the private key with your life and use that to decrypt messages to you.<br /><br />That&#039;s why if you want the vendor to encrypt his answer back to you, you include your own public key in your message to them :)
