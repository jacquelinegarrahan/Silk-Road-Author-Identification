				Hi Guys<br />Can anyone take pity on a newcomer and give me some help in purchasing bitcoins to buy goodies on Silk Road? I know this must have been asked a thousand times before, and yes, I have trawled the FAQ sections, but I&#039;m still struggling. I have a pre paid credit card that I wanted to use, but Intersango say I can&#039;t use a credit card &quot;because of the risk of chargebacks&quot;. Unfortunately I don&#039;t know what chargebacks are, so I&#039;m none the wiser. It seems I can purchase some by a bank transfer, but surely that exposes me to a great deal of risk by making my bank account details public?<br />Any pointers would be much appreciated<br />Cheers<br />John

				Yeah well i&#039;m looking for some paypal/cc way just aswel.<br /><br />It seems you got to :<br />1. Find a website that accepts paypal for some sort of e-currency that is behaving like a stockmarket + fee.<br />2. Make sure that currency is exchangable with bitcoins somewhere.<br />3. Exchange the first currency into the second currency wich again is some sort of stock market + fees.<br /><br />So at the end of the day (rather 2 weeks or so) howmuch does one lousy bc costs? Why you guys actualy went for bitcoin in the first place?

				**all of this is done on a regular browser not tor network**Go to mtgox.com. Make an account then go to bitinstant.com. Pick the mtgox coupon funds option and then pick the option where u can deposit to bank. from there it lets u pick a few options (chase bank and bank of america being 2 of them). The drop off is ANONYMOUS and they dont require ID. Just print out the information they send to your email and use that to verify any information having to do with account numbers and such. The money will go to your mtgox account. (perfectly legal anyway). from there trade the mtgox dollars for bitcoin (takes 2 seconds). Create an intermediary wallet on blockchain.info. send ur coins to that address. now on the **tor network** deposit the coins from blockchain.info/wallet to your SR address. It takes a few hours to show up.

				yes, cash deposit. I just made one today. Got my dollars in an hour after the deposit. Money was transferred to mtgox. converted dollars to btc in less than a minute after that.
