				What are some things you should never ask as they would be too great for Data Mining/Possible LE.<br /><br />Some I can think of:<br /><br />What state/zip code are you From?(variations Province/etc). <br />Can we talk off Tor?<br />What do you look like?<br />What is your occupation?<br /><br />

				Honestly. I would say anything that could be tied to you - the real you - in real life. So None of this chit chat about I was driving a my pink zebra striped Ferrari down Hollywood Blvd when I looked over and saw George Lucas making out with Herbert from Family Guy in the back of a mini-van tricked out to look like an Ice Cream Truck. I had just gotten my triple machiatto-latte with extra Communist sperm and was bout to take Rudy my daughter to the Jackin Boober concert .<br /><br />*Hey I&#039;m bored and cant sleep. =P

				I plan to try not to reveal that I am Jackie Chan and live accross the street from the Fort Worth Police Station. Not too worried though, I have the trunk of my baby-blue Ford Pinto all duct-taped tight to keep the smell in and you can hardly smell the drugs in there. Since the car is &quot;booted&quot; for unpaid parking tickets, I feel extra safe because I figure it is unlikely to get stolen. I guess I should avoid mentioning it is cloudy and 78 degrees F here as that would limit my possible locations too much. It would probably be OK to talk about the Parade going by my house today since it is so exciting and all. :-)
