				Very sorry if this has been rehashed before but before I do anything dumb I&#039;d like to clarify it. I want to buy a product that is listed as $200 (my SR is listed in USD because the seller said in his info I should in order to get the proper price he is asking), but 38.1 BTC. However, when I go to convert my $200 on Mt. Gox (I only have $200 on there right now and another transfer from Dwolla&gt;Mt.Gox would take longer than the time I have..rookie mistake, I know), it wouldn&#039;t give me enough bitcoins (only ~37.9) to fulfill the BTC listed price because of the current rate. Should I convert them and hope the seller understands that the rate just fluctuated high when I wanted to buy them? I don&#039;t want to not be able to buy it because of ~.2 BTC, then have to wait for my money to cycle back through Dwolla and Mt. Gox in order to have the funds to, especially because he said in the product info that there isn&#039;t much left at the current price.<br />Thanks, sorry this was long-winded, and thanks in advance for help!

				The best thing to do is get MORE bitcoins than he&#039;s asking. You want to be sure you&#039;ll have enough to buy what you want ... even if the price fluctuates a bit or you forgot that you needed to opt for the more expensive shipping option or you wanted fries with your order.
