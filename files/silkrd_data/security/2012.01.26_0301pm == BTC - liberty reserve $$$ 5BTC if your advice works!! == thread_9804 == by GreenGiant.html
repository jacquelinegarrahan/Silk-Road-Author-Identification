				&nbsp;thank you for the information, due to the recent drop in BTC, sadly this is not a viable option at the moment fee&#039;s are just a bit to high &amp; i&#039;d be getting less than i need. might have to hold out for aurumxchange to start taking codes again. If BTC would jump back to 6.25 i&#039;d be a very happy man :(

				Although new, I *have* noticed a trend in BTC fluctuation. I notice it drops mid-week, and raises towards end of week. Usually highest on Sunday&#039;s. I&#039;ve taken to watching Mt.Gox lately, and have noticed BTC worth is higher when they have more coin, and lower when they have less....this is also sensible in that they wouldn&#039;t want to buy at higher prices and sell at lower. But I can *almost* guarantee on Wednesday&#039;s that Gox will have less then 100K in their account, and on weekends a few hundred K. Again, I know nothing. these have just been observances over 2 months. <br />Why not just use bitinstant to transfer your BTC into hard cash and put it in your bank account? BTC is still legal to buy and sell, right?
