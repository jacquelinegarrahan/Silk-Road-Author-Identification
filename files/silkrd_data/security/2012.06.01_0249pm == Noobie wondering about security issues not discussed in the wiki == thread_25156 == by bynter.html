				From what I&#039;ve observed, there are a few ways for the authorities to track people in this sight. <br /><br />1: What&#039;s keeping them from posing as a seller, and then going to the address? Would they not go for the buyers, but instead the sellers? Is it a possibility down the road of this site?<br /><br />2: If I get a package mailed to a physical address, what all would there be to worry about? If they shipped USPS which can&#039;t search without a warrant, and they packaged it up properly, would there be any issue? What about using my house if I can&#039;t find a another? What my actual name? <br /><br />3: Short of those two things and maybe being scammed(though I&#039;ll probably just buy from reputable sellers), is there anything else to worry about?

				1. LE ain&#039;t interested in minor buyers mate. They are interested in the Vendors/Mods/Staff/Admin. It would take too much time and LE can&#039;t just wantonly sell drugs to people to get arrests. <br /><br />2. There is obviously always a small risk but it&#039;s so minor that it&#039;s not worth worrying about. 200 Billion piece of mail go through the U.S mail system per year....them&#039;s good odds. If you are still worried use a different address than to your home or get a PO box. Regarding your name that&#039;s up to you if you use a fake one, there are arguments for and against it.<br /><br />3. Yeah encryption. Make sure you learn how to use TrueCrypt and PGP at least. <br /><br />Hope this helps. <br /><br />Lim
