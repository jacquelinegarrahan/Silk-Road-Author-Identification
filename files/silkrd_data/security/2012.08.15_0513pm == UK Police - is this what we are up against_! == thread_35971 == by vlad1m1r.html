				Fellow British SR users like me will be familiar with the case of 12 year old girl Tia Sharp who was apparently murdered by her grandmother&#039;s boyfriend Stewart Hazell. <br /><br />http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-apologise-for-mistakes-in-the-search-for-tia-sharp-8034856.html<br /><br />Sad to say this sort of thing is not very rare these days but I was astonished by the incompetence of the Police as it took them over five days and FOUR searches of the property in question (one of which involved &quot;body recovery&quot; dogs which are specifically trained to detect dead bodies) to discover this young girl. <br /><br />Quote from Metropolitan Police Commander Neil Basu as per the above Guardian Article as follows:<br /><br />&quot;All parts of the premises were searched, including the location where a body was discovered on Friday, 10 August,&quot; he said. &quot;An early review has been conducted, and it is now clear that human error delayed the discovery of the body within the house. We have apologised to Tia&#039;s mother that our procedures did not lead to the discovery of the body on this search.&quot;<br /><br />As it turned out the body was found in the attic wrapped in a bed sheet which in turn had been placed in a black plastic bag. <br /><br />I ask you as a community - is there really what we are up against?! Can they be that unobservant - or do we think they are trying to lull us into a false sense of security? <br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Pro tip: From now on wrap all drugs in blanket, place inside bin bag, and put in loft.<br /><br />Joking aside, it&#039;s really sad whatever did happen to that poor girl.

				Perhaps if we weren&#039;t hunting down day-trippers and cannabis smokers we could afford to hire actual good detectives onto real crimes like this.

Im frmo LA, but now live in UK.&nbsp; In LA yu get beating just for looking at cops wrong. You call the cops, BOOM, they are there guna blazing, BAM BAM BAM. entirely over agressive, makes our streets a militia zone. over agressive. BUT no CCTV, no video networking, no interstate connection. i got away with four felonies in one state then got pulled over and ID&#039;d in a another state and was let go drive on rigth tthen and there because records were clearn from that state. so, the states are confused, muddled, and very very agressive (LAPD esp, world famous cop KILLLAZ) BUT,. uk - now the uk is useless. police are useless, they cant travel past 100mph in a car chase (without imprezas) they can use guns (without armed response) they have all these health and safety regs, they come to your house two weeks after its been burguled to &quot;take finger prints&quot;. other day my friend caught a guy touching a kid, so we jumped his stomped him out and got 24 hours and let go from cell next morning with hot chocolate and cheese sandwhich, so cops in uk are FAIR, but weak. but most importantly, THEY ARE CLICKED ON. NETWORKING IS A+++ the cctv here is highest in world per population and we all know that echelon has been having everyone tapped for 20 years so, i couldnt pull that same escape shit that i pulled in hickville usa if i tried it here no. senteences are less here , they let more crims out of jail earlier here, but they are nmuch more intelligence focused,&nbsp; thats why CIA and FBI suck Scotland yard and MI6&#039;s dick.&nbsp; they control the real flow of information between west and eat PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD.<br /><br />regarding your post bud, all i cant say is *faceplant* poor girl, idiot feds, what else to say really. +1 to all who +1&#039;s me

				About a month ago 3 asian men were pulled over for having no insurnce etc.... The car was impounded and the men let go with a ticket, subsequently 3 days later the car was searched at the police impound and found to contain 2 or 3 firearms.. They were arrested luckily and yes they were planning a terrorist attack but i bet a hell of alot of evidence was disposed of..&nbsp; British police are incompetent...

You made her live in a house with her dead daughter&#039;s body in the loft for five fucking days. You can find a grow-op in a loft from 1000ft up, but you can&#039;t find a body that&#039;s 3ft in front of you? This is disgraceful, and everyone involved in this botched investigation should be deeply fucking ashamed.
