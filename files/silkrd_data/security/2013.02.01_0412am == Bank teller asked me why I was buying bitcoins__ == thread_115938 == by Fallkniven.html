				What?&nbsp; They shouldn&#039;t care -- bitcoins are legal and can be used for plenty of legal things.&nbsp; Both of the companies you mentioned refer to bitcoins in their name ... so I don&#039;t think it has anything to do with the manager warning the teller to look out for this account.&nbsp; Especially if it was spendbitcoins.

The cashier has no way of knowing what bill you are paying. <br /><br />It sucks that you guys don&#039;t have an anonymous option over there.<br /><br />Bit coins are legal to buy here and are used for a lot other legit reasons.<br /><br />You handled the situation well. <br /><br />She may have just been curious and making conversation with you.

				The guy right before you that dropped money into that account was probably a complete stoner heatbag wearing a free the weed shirt, dreadlocks and a rastafarian hat while reeking of weed. <br /><br />This is actually a true story because I was behind a guy exactly like that while in a place I can&#039;t mention due to OPSEC. &quot;Oh hey I&#039;m buying drugs too&quot;<br /><br />

				I know buying BTC is legal but I would probably change banks if someone flat out asks me that question. Your answer was good, though. The truth is you can make a lot of money in the BTC exchange business at this time.

				Interesting.<br /><br />I constantly make $5,000 deposits over the counter for the purpose of purchasing Bit Coins, and not once have I been asked a question like that. I&#039;ve conducted around 30 - $35,000 worth of deposits in the space of 1.5 months and not once have I changed my wallet address either.<br /><br />The most I&#039;ve ever been &quot;interrogated&quot; by a teller is when I handed her the 5k and the deposit form, she filled out the deposit details on the computer then as she picked up the 5 grand with a smile on her face it seemed she was just making small talk and asked me what I was buying.

				Forgive me if I missed it, but what system of bitcoin purchase were you using that allows one to go to a bank???<br /><br />Sounds like you mention Canada in there. <br /><br />In the US, there has been no bitcoin transactions done at bank tellers since BitInstant stopped the Bank of America payments. I guess once Jimmy Buffet realized he wasn&#039;t making his normal millions on the deal he had it quashed. After all, him and Soros run the world economy.<br /><br />So how is it that you go to the bank and get bitcoins?? We here in Obamaland are clueless!!!!!!!!!

				was it the ANZ bank that this person worked for?<br /><br />i think the ANZ bank they even ask you for your name and phone number when you do deposits with bitcoins. they&#039;ve asked me before. i use another bank that they dont ask questions. <br /><br />you might ask &quot;which bank?&quot; <br /><br />well the answer is in your question. use that bank. hint hint.

				Two bitcoin providers were mentioned in OP, they are australian traders (IIRC).<br /><br />They have Australian bank accounts and are perfectly legitimate bitcoin businesses. You make an order on their webpage for bitcoins, they give you their bank account details and say, deposit $xxx into this account with this reference number using physical cash-over-counter (online &amp; electronic transactions leave more paper trails).<br /><br />They then match up the reference number from the bank deposit to the order you made with them, they then deposit the bitcoins into your nominated Bitcoin address. All very anonymous, random cash going into their account, not funds being deposited electronically (bank knows exactly whos account it came from), banks do not know (unless their policies dictate otherwise) where physically deposited cash comes from and who deposited it.<br /><br />(Technically, banks could review time-stamped High Definition camera footage from inside the bank, and match the time on the camera to the time of the transaction you made. They now have HD video of you depositing cash into a bitcoin sellers bank account, as long as you dont give them any personal details, you should be OK). Then there&#039;s the studio quality HD microphones...<br /><br />Some banks ask for personal details when depositing cash into an account, some do not.<br /><br /><br />Edit - I&#039;ll be keeping the name of the bank to myself for security reasons, it&#039;s nothing personal. Suffice to say that it was one of the Big Four Banks in Australia.<br /><br />&quot;Which Bank?&quot; is right ;) &#039;nuff said.

				I&#039;ve never been asked, but here are a few things I&#039;d consider:<br /><br />1. It&#039;s up from 2$ USD in Nov 2011 to 20$ in Jan 2013, I&#039;m hoping the trend continues<br /><br />2. Video game item trading. tf2wx.com lets people use bitcoins to buy credits for in-game items (weapons, hats, geeky stuff.) for A Free to play game &#039;Team Fortress 2.&quot; You can buy a rare basebat bat with christmas lights for about 45$. Or a pirate hat with ghosts flying around it for 250$, etc.<br /><br />I like the second one because once you start talking to folks about computer stuff their eyes just glaze over and they can&#039;t wait for you to stop talking again.

				Classic case of people not minding their business. You handled it well though, I most likely would of said something that would of caused me to have to find a new bank to deposit! But seriously though, nosey people do tend to grind my gears.

				solid answer.<br /><br />either that or just say its a private transaction.<br /><br />the rising bitcoin prices are good for everyone imo. even though they are legal and what not passing the buying of a bitcoins off as an investment is very much plausible now

				Absolutely. People are buying them just for that. <br /><br />The OP handled the situation great. Stayed calm and gave a good answer.&nbsp; <br />Bitcoins are legal to buy and owning them is not proof of anything. <br /><br />People worry about this part too much and do things that put themselves at risk by buying&nbsp; bitcoins from scamers in exchange for money packs and such. At best you end up paying a lot more for coins than you need to. At worst you get riped off.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				You should have told her it was none of her business.<br /><br />She literally has no right to ask you that, and could be given in to serious trouble by her superiors had you snitched on her. <br /><br />There is nothing worse than a person who does not know how to mind their own fucking business.

				Whatever you do, don&#039;t respond with &quot;none of your business&quot; like some have said. You ARE conspiring to do something illegal, even if what you&#039;re doing in the moment is legal. Defensiveness is a tell for guilt, always avoid answering out of emotion. Smile, then deliver your prepared response. A genuine looking smile, and a plausible response is all that is required to keep your real intentions private. Anything else is going to give you away to some extent.

				just say online poker/gambling or some nerdy video game credit things. they&#039;ll probably just pity your lameness then. if you kick off about invasion of privacy it&#039;ll seem really suspicious. i&#039;ve gone to the bureau de change to buy/sell euros before when they&#039;ve asked me where i&#039;m going on holiday. bit of a dull job working in a bank.

				Something I&#039;ve gotten asked a couple times is &quot;do you own the account.&quot; To which I say &quot;no, it&#039;s that business&#039;s and point to the name on the deposit slip. &quot; And I was asked twice at two different branches what the business was, to which I said &quot;a digital currency exchange&quot; and he said &quot;like for cell phone plans?&quot; I said, &quot;no....&quot; And gave him a &quot;what the fuck are you talking about?&quot; look. The other time I just I started to explain and I only got to &quot;you ever heard of bitcoins?&quot; and he had my receipt and the transaction was over. He didn&#039;t give a shit. <br /><br />I really just need to get a job at a bank and deposit the cash myself.
