				Hey guys I hear nothing but good things about BST and wanted to know if having the coins sent directly to your SR wallet is legit or a big no no? Legit using tor? Legit using clearnet?<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				I had my coins sent straight to my SR address. While I don&#039;t recommend this, it still works. Just takes a bit longer since the coins have to tumble and stuff.<br /><br />What I recommend and what you should do, too, is to get an Instawallet, send the coins there, and from there to SR. Not really much of a hassle, and you&#039;re safer off doing it that way (then again, there&#039;s no way to determine if a BTC address is connected to an SR account or not). Some people want to be extra cautious, which there&#039;s no harm in doing so.

				100% LEGIT!!!<br /><br />They send them from with SR anyways...but even if they didn&#039;t.....why would you ever care of they were sent straight to your SR wallet? What I mean is how would you think that is some sort of security threat to YOU?

				as both Shamu says and BST says on their onion site, a bitcoin address is just that - an address in the blockchain - not linked to SR in any way.&nbsp; Ive always gone BST straight to SR<br /><br />On a different topic - how much does BST current waits deter you from using their service?&nbsp; Several months ago you could get same day service, now you need to pre-order nearly a week in advance. I love the service, I just wish they werent so damn popular now

				The wait doesnt bother me I just trying to line up everything in advance to avoid hicups (because lets be honest they can happen often) So the wait doesnt bother me much especially with such great service!
