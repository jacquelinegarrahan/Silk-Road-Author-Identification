				We all know that BTCs are based on on open system. I want to know how transparent it actually is. <br /><br />LE is monitoring SR (duh)... Finding out the vendors BTC accounts is not that hard of a deal. So they see now what ever account is sending money there (all the customers). So pretty much every BTC account used here on SR is compromised. And if there is any personal information attached to it, you are pretty much toast... Right?<br /><br />IS it that easy?<br /><br />Please share some info.

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s that easy because per my understanding bitcoins actually exchange hands several times before they rest in one persons account. It&#039;s not like a particular bit of data gets sent from one person to another but rather is pushed through several levels before it reaches the person. If someone buys their coins with cash like via localbitcoin or some other service this increases anonymity because there are no account numbers tied to the purchase or card numbers on file, just whatever web traffic has been seen.<br /><br />Plus the sheer volume of bitcoin transactions makes it pretty fruitless for&nbsp; them to comb through looking for specific transactions. On the grand scale it&#039;s just too costly to go after the average small potato and expend that much effort for the grand reward of...spending more money on them while they&#039;re locked up.

				If LE is watching SR they are not doing a very good job at all. It is ridiculous the amount of vendors I have talked to who have been using very unsafe methods for almost a year moving a lot of product and still doing it perfectly fine.... If I had LE power/influence I could bust a big-time vendor every single week. So why aren&#039;t they doing it?<br /><br />The problem is it&#039;s a lot of work and would require a cross-country effort to try to catch a vendor, or overall just a ton of effort to track the potential trails. The possibility of LE landing on someone elses front porch who is a total stranger is so high(if a vendor uses basic stealth precautions to obtain supplies) that it may not even be worth the wasted effort to attempt to track down a vendor. Very very few vendors here move enough product to warrant a cross country LE co-operative effort. <br /><br />But don&#039;t let this logic give you any reason to be unsafe^ take as many security precautions as you can when you can. Better to be safe than sorry.... and I like to say with my stealth... better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.

Every transaction is traceable from originating address all the way to destination address.<br /><br />Correct, a lot of Bitcoind operators actively deny all confirmations from any SR-related BTC address. <br /><br />But the addresses sending BTC to the vendors address are all located on the same Bitcoind. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t use the word compromised. I would say it&#039;s public. As BTC always has been. <br /><br />No personal info inside BTC transactions themselves. Just a source and destination BTC address and amount. <br /><br />
