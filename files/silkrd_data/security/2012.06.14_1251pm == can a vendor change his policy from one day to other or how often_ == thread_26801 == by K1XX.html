				Vendors can change their policies whenever they want to. If you have a legitimate complaint about a transaction, hopefully you didn&#039;t finalize early. If you did finalize early, then you&#039;re out of luck, and the most you can do is leave some bad feedback. Before doing that though, you should try and work it out with the vendor.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t finalize early, you can use the resolution center to try and settle your dispute.

				Morally speaking, if a vendor has a policy which he changes *whilst your transaction is in progress*, then he tries to hit you with his updated policy, I&#039;d say you have legitimate grounds for complaint.<br /><br />Good luck with that though.

				Vendors can change their policy as-and-when they see fit, however only a twat vendor would change their policy to get out of doing the right thing. Personally if I changed my policy what I would do it and apply it to all new orders from that point on. Keeps it fair.
