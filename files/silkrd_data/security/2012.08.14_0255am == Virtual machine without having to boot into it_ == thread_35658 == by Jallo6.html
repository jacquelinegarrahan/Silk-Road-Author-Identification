				I was wondering if there is a VM that I can use that would NOT require me to boot into it.&nbsp; Like I could run my Win 7 and the VM at the same time kinda like how the XP VM that comes with Win 7 works.<br /><br />If this is possible what is the most anonymous VM and Linux to run?&nbsp; And does NOT booting into the VM make it less secure?<br /><br /><br />Thanks

				Yes it is definitely less secure. Care to share why you&#039;d want to do this?

				You mean have a Linux distro open in a window while Windows is running? Like this? (http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/VM-example.png)<br /><br />Or are you talking about XP Mode? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Virtual_PC#Windows_XP_Mode)<br /><br />I think that&#039;s custom code by Microsoft. Generally speaking, you have to boot an OS. No other way to run it. That said, I know VirtualBox has a feature called &#039;seamless mode&#039;. Look into that.<br /><br />VMs are VMs, I know of none that focus on anonymity. I like VirtualBox. As for an anonymous Linux distro, I know of Tails. (https://tails.boum.org/)

				I think I understand what you mean ..... if not let me know&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />You could have your Win7 machine, running a VM product such as VMWare, and have a VM of what ever operating system you like.<br /><br />You wouldnÂ´t need to power down the machine at all, just suspend it.&nbsp; Even if you reboot your Win7 machine, you can open up VMWare and wake up your VM.<br /><br />Please dont use Windows and secure in the same sentence&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Hopefully that helps&nbsp; :)<br /><br />JJ

Download VMware or Virtualbox and whatever Linux distro you want. I&#039;m sure there are guides on the internet if you need a step by step walkthrough.

				I&#039;m not sure if this is the same thing that you&#039;re talking about, but I have a friend who has a Mac and requires Windows for a few games.&nbsp; He downloaded a program called Parallels that allows him to run OS-X and Windows simultaneously.&nbsp; He can essentially alt-tab (or whatever the Apple equivalent is) between operating systems.

I had a similar setup when I ran Linux. I had a VM with XP in it so I could run the random program that refuses to run in wine. In fact, I prefer booting a virtual XP to using wine. But that&#039;s just me.
