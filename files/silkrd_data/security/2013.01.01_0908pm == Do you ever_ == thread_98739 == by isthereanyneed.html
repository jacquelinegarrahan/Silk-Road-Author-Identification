				Do you ever worry that the banks are going to get suspicious after making various and regular transfers to get btc? I mean its not as if they could prove anything&nbsp; and even if they have their suspicions whats going to happen a slap on the wrist for buying a bit of weed or a couple of pills in a safe way.<br /><br />I hate having to go to all this bullshit to get decent weed but the streets are to unpredictable now, so much shit no quality control, I want to choose my strains and quantities but I want to smoke it in peace I want the world to know what their missing drinking their poison every night getting all angry and unreasonable whilst we smoke chill and become better people I know some day soon all this will be a distant crazy dream but until the herb is legal everywhere this is the bullshit we must go through anyway back to topi&nbsp; lol,.......Do banks know their shit oh and what about the postmen I worry about him the nosey bugger I mean its like one parcel a month max but its not a suspicious package.<br /><br />Tips on keeping everything on the DL would be gratful with banks and post?&nbsp; I dont think I can cover my tracks anymore than I do but hey you never know!<br /><br />Thanks

				Bitcoin is legal, also they can&#039;t see why you use them, they can&#039;t prove it and more important they don&#039;t care. <br />Nothing to worry about banks as long as btc is legal.

				<br />Using bank transfers does leave a digital trail however, the bank won&#039;t care unless you&#039;re transfering obscene piles of cash. <br /><br />It is legal to purchase bitcoins, but, should you be investiagted to the point that bank records are seized, tha digital trail could look very incriminating. <br /><br /><br />
