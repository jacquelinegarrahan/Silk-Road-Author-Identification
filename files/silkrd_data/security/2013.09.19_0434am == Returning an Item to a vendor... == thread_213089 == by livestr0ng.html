				I bought a scale from a vendor. It&#039;s malfunctioning. It&#039;s from a very well respected vendor who definitely has worked with me in an issue with my past order. I offered to return it since there&#039;s nothing illegal about a scale and the vendor doesn&#039;t even sell anything illegal. He gave me the address to return it to for a refund. I live in USA and he lives in UK. Is this safe? How should I go about returning it?

				Neither of you have done anything wrong so no big deal. Assuming its small enough just drop it in a bubble mailer and send it on its way.

				I get the whole supporting a criminal orginization thing. But even if the package is opened no one is going to think &quot;Ha must be silk fuckin road!&quot; when they see the scale. Unless you already being investigated/followed. In which case your fucked anyway. Just go mail it and put a church address as the return. Your overthinkin this one way too much.

				To keep your identity a secret, sending it anonymously seems very smart. People who don&#039;t get that make me nervous.<br /><br />Use a real return address. If you mail it from a postal counter, you may be on video and they can ask you if the return address is you.<br />I don&#039;t really think that&#039;s a problem in your situation. Just be aware of the issues. To avoid the counter, keep it under 13 OZs, use stamps, a tracking label and drop it in a &quot;blue box&quot;. They have been giving out the tracking labels more easily I think recently. Shipping forum is full of info about tracking label issues.

I ended up not getting tracking though :-\ Shipping was like $15 as is so I really hope it makes it there.
