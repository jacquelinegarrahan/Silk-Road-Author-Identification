				This is the Way I have used most recently and it worked great.<br />1: Open and account at mtgox.com, Do not use tor or your account will be locked for fraud protection reasons. Copy your account number. (no need to get verified unless you plan on exchanging a lot of money)<br />2: Go to bitinstant.com and select cash to mtgox, enter amount to deposit and remember that you will lose money from their fees, have to pay fees for exchanging to bitcoin on mtgox, etc, so put in more than you need, like 10% more.<br />3: Choose a location, like walmart or cvs, to deposit the money. You will be redirected to a site that will charge 3.95 to wire the funds in addition to bitinstant fees.<br />5: Print out the payment slip with the info you need to pay.<br />4: Go to the place you selected, you will be using the money wire service there (MoneyGram I think) and have to fill out a form or use the red phone there to enter your info, select the paying account/bill option and enter your info as it asks for it, the code for the service that transfers money to bitinstant, the account number, etc. It is all on the payment slip you printed. Dont be paranoid, I was the first time but it worked flawlessly.<br />6: Go home, log in to mtgox (not from tor!) and wait for the money to be transfered, should take only 30 minutes or so. <br />7: When the money is there put in a buy order on mtgox for as many bitcoins as you can and remember you will get slightly less than your order because the have their own fees (these fees are unavoidable and dont add up to a lot considering what you are getting)<br />8: Log into SR and go to account, copy your bitcoin wallet number, paste it into mt gox transfer area (use tor for SR and a normal browser for mtgox, dont mess this up or mt gox will freeze your account and it will be a pain to get your money out, never use tor with mtgox just normal browsers like chrome), put in the amount to be transferred ( I dont recommend leaving bitcoins in mtgox, some bitcoin sites have shut down recently and bitcoins keep going up in value so I would recommend keeping whats left after your purchase till you want to make another purchase. Make sure you know your pin on SR before doing this because it will take days to get a new one if you loose it and the value of your coins may change or the product you wanted may be gone) and I recommend checking the .005 payment for faster transfer as I got my bitcoins transferred in&nbsp; an hour this way rather than it taking 4+ hours as before, you need to leave .005 bitcoins in your account for this fee or the transfer wont happen.<br />9: Wait for coins to be transferred, make your purchases. Make sure to do a search on your seller here on the forums or check the rumor mill section to make sure your seller is legit.<br />10: Wait impatiently for package but don&#039;t hassle the seller unless it has taken more than a few days longer than promised.<br />11: Make sure to Finalize as soon as you get your package and leave a review once you know its legit.<br />12: rinse, repeat<br /><br />Hope that helps!
