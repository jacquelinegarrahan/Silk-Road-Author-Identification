				I&#039;ve noticed a couple of SR vendors doing this, exchanging their surplus bitcoins for cash sent in the mail. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m not thinking this through, but how can this possibly be safe?&nbsp; Even if they have a box registered to a fake ID, it still seems like an excellent way to get a bunch of cash confiscated, reveal their location within 20-30 miles and possibly end up on CCTV.&nbsp; If I were an LEO here, all I would have to do is express interest in sending over some cash, and bang, I have the address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody care to enlighten me, or is this as bad as it seems security-wise?

				Ok, I messaged the vendors I had in mind linking them to this thread.&nbsp; Hopefully the prospect of Cum In Mouth is enough to get them to find a new method of cashing out.

				In earlier times on here (that is to say, several months ago, ha ha) when pretty much all vendors stayed in escrow, this was usually how scammers operated: they would find some reason, any reason, to get buyers to use western union or liberty express, or Nigerian Certified Cashier&#039;s Checks(joke)&nbsp; in order to get the buyer out of escrow.&nbsp; Usually they just never shipped product at all, once they did this.&nbsp; Often it would come in the form of a &#039;fire sale&#039; or some such beast, and they pretended--and talked up--their long time selling on the &#039;Dark Net&#039; and how much dope they&#039;ed sold already, and how now, just this once, they had 10,000 or so oxycodone they wanted to get rid of at &#039;fantastico&#039; prices, and then they just disappeared with the funds.<br /><br />My favorite was some guy who also had a &#039;female&#039; shill who came on here and said she had purchased a bunch and how good it was...they almost always have some shill with very few posts making a lot of noise over on this site....<br /><br />Different variations on this, but really, it&#039;s just a way to get you out of escrow, and if they use cash, then they don&#039;t even need to bother with the hassle of trading off their ill-gotten btc.&nbsp; Once you&#039;re out of escrow, they own your money, and act accordingly.&nbsp; Come cry on here, tho, if you go for it, as it provides entertainment.

				All bulk business on private forums is done via cash in mail. This is between trusted persons though.<br /><br />I wouldnt ever recommend using a vendor that offers CIM in a public setting or sending CIM to someone you came across in a public setting either.<br /><br />-AC

				I dunno about ALL bulk business, but it does present a lot of logistics trouble if you need to place a $100,000 order. How to get so much E-currency loaded, plus who wants to pay 15% in wire and exchanger fee on that? CIM is very insecure and I would never want to work with it, but it is true that people dealing in large bulk amounts tend towards it. Then again I have heard of very large E-currency transfers for bulk as well. You really need to rely on the membership screening of a forum if you fuck with CIM and historically membership screening is not very good, but in many cases such people have already known each other for many years and worked up to such large amounts together. I guess in general if you are trusting someone you have known for years to send you $100k of drugs, that it is less absurd to expect them to let you send them $100k of money, than if you are sending someone you just met on SR $90 for a ten strip. But I still always suggest against CIM.

They&#039;d also not be able to trade off the goodwill they&#039;d already built up using drugs.<br /><br />How then can I do it safely? Firstly I only sell legal products/services. It&#039;s not illegal to buy or sell Bitcoins.<br /><br />I do worry sometimes that some disgruntled buyer would post the current mailing address I happen to be using for the cash here on the forums but I hope they won&#039;t for the same reason I think none of the sellers - it would undermine trust in the site overall so we&#039;d all lose out!<br /><br />What I can say about the service I offer is that the cash is sent to a private address with a secure mailbox and is banked immediately on receipt. It&#039;s not illegal to send currency within the UK and LEO would have a hard time making a case to confiscate the amounts in question. The methods used to bank the money are also done in such a way that they can&#039;t be traced back to the depositor but please forgive me if I don&#039;t go into details!<br /><br />Certainly as it says on the SR site itself if you have previously bought goods by mail you should create a new account in order to become a vendor.<br /><br />Your concern, is very much appreciated incidentally! :-)<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><br /><br />
