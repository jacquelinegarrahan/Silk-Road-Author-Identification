				How do people mine Bitcoin? What is it exactly? What does it take money, time, expertises? How much money can you make mining it?

				The basics<br />- Bitcoins are made from solving a &quot;problem&quot; before anyone else.&nbsp; <br />- The more powerful your setup the more chance you stand<br />- ~6x per hour a &quot;block&quot; is found and the reward given to one miner, this was 50btc, now it&#039;s 25btc, eventually it will be 12.5 etc.<br />- A block is used to store data about bitcoin transactions, this is why you have to wait for blocks to be found before you BTC gets to the road<br />- All bitcoin transaction fees go to the miner that accepts the transactions in blocks they find<br />- People join &quot;Pools&quot; to share the work and rewards with other miners for consistent income with less risk<br />- The effort to get get a bitcoin is based on how much solving power there is across all miners, to keep the 6 per hour average<br />- There is a finite amount of bitcoins that can ever be minted<br />- Bitcoins were found by the millions by earlier adopters, eg. Satoshi, Bitcoins creator found 1814400BTC at the start of bitcoins life with little effort<br /><br />How to mine<br />You have a few options.&nbsp; Originally you could use a run of the mill computer, then focus shifted to computers with strong GPUs, then dedicated systems with multiple GPUs, and now it&#039;s moving to ASICs, which processors created for the sole purpose of bitcoin creation efficiency.&nbsp; You have to take into account the power costs, which with any less than a dedicated system or ASIC will probably outweigh power costs. <br />Let&#039;s say you have a PC with a nice GPU (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison#Popular_Mining_Cards), and think it may be economical.&nbsp; You&#039;d need to have the bitcoin client installed (http://bitcoin.org/en/download), and mining software like guiminer (http://guiminer.org/).&nbsp; Working them out is a long process and I won&#039;t go into that, google it if you&#039;re interested.&nbsp; You have the option of mining to a pool, or mining solo (possibly meaning months/years between huge finds).&nbsp; <br />Or you could spend into an ASIC, which are still in early days and look set to take over the scene.&nbsp; Two popular options are Butterfly Labs (http://www.butterflylabs.com/) or Avalon ASICs (http://launch.avalon-asics.com/).&nbsp; They&#039;re as close to plug and play as it gets I think, needing only a little configuration.&nbsp; People have bought them and had them pay for themselves in under a week, but as more enter the market it becomes harder and harder.<br /><br />Requirements<br />It&#039;s handy to have some tech know how, but you can pick it up if you read around long enough.&nbsp; There&#039;s tutorials for everything even if they can be hard to follow.&nbsp; The time is not too huge of an issue, once you&#039;ve set it up all you might have to do is make sure it doesn&#039;t catch fire to anything (this has happened more than once by cramming high performance parts too closely without adequate cooling).&nbsp; Cheap electricity helps, you&#039;ll need an ok internet connection, and space for noisy hot machines.&nbsp; The best times to get in on things have passed I feel.<br /><br />Income<br />Really hard to judge, since it&#039;s based on predictions, and there&#039;s a large chance people will come along with a bigger and better systems and push up the difficulty.&nbsp; But you can make good guesses using the calculators online, like (http://tpbitcalc.appspot.com).&nbsp; Here&#039;s one I made just now, showing what a $1250 invest may perform like (http://tpbitcalc.appspot.com/?difficulty=26162875.6826&amp;hashrate=25000.00&amp;exchangerate=94.53&amp;bitcoinsperblock=25.00&amp;rigcost=1249.00&amp;powerconsumption=127.00&amp;powercost=0.10&amp;investmentperiod=355).&nbsp; You can see it&#039;s making $50 of BTC a day, and pays for itself in just under a month.&nbsp; The problem with this estimate is that as more people get in on this, the harder it is for each to make money (only 6 blocks are found per hour).<br /><br />Footnote<br />I haven&#039;t read up on this much recently.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t proofread it.&nbsp; I may be wrong on any subset of information, if so I apologize.&nbsp; <br /><br />
