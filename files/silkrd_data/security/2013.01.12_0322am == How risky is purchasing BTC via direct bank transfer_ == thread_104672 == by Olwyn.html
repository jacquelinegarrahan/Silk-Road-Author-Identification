				Using a service such as moneygram/zipzap would be difficult for me. Because of this, I&#039;ve been researching buying BTC using a direct bank account transfer. Using a service, such as coinbase, you can directly link your bank account and transfer funds from it to your coinbase wallet - while this is convenient, it obviously has the negative of your name being directly associated with the purchase of those coins - HOWEVER, purchasing coins is not illegal, and does not itself set off any red flags.<br /><br />So my question is, is how risky is this? On the topic of Bitcoins, there seems to be a lot of misinformation and conflicting advice. If I purchase using my real name and bank account information, should I worry about my coins&nbsp; not being anonymous? And should I take precautions to make them anonymous? If I were to send the coins&nbsp; through several wallet services before submitting to my SR wallet, would that be enough?

				To make a long story short: the coins can be traced.&nbsp; But bear in mind that in order for that to even matter, their ultimate destination has to first be directly proven to be &quot;of interest.&quot;&nbsp; I mean the guy you give the coins to for drugs is going to cash out at some point, and how he does that is neither here nor there (infact I don&#039;t even know what the usual way is, frankly).&nbsp; But the coins will keep on circulating or just sit around in some speculator&#039;s wallet while the price goes up.<br /><br />Either way, it&#039;s unlikely that as a buyer you need to worry about this.&nbsp; But your answer is that yes, your name and bank account are pretty much forever traceable.

				Buying coins isn&#039;t illegal. Buying coins itself won&#039;t make you the target of an investigation.<br /><br />If you are targeted for investigation, it won&#039;t be because they have analyzed the blockchain and discovered illicit transactions. Before they ever start looking at bitcoins, they will have a substantial case against you already.

				Taking the two above posts into consideration, it sounds like going through the trouble of paying via cash deposit at a bank/walmart/cvs etc would just be extra work for a false sense of security then? Your coins may be 99% anonymous ( assuming you filled out the cash deposit with a false identity ), but in what situation would that even be beneficial? If you&#039;re under investigation, then it won&#039;t be due to your coins not being anonymous, and at the end of the day, why would they even care how you paid for it?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to hold off purchasing coins via direct&nbsp; account transfer for a bit longer just to see if any other advice rolls in. Right now, it&#039;s sounding like it would not be much of an issue for someone just looking to buy personal amounts of substances.

				Exactly right.&nbsp; A lot of people use SR as their source and then resell locally though (which to me kind of seems like the backward thing to do... it&#039;s safer here, but whatever -- their life&#039;s their own).&nbsp; So if you only bother to measure your orders in kilos or pounds, and you really are somebody that&#039;s &quot;of that level of interest,&quot; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just one more loose end that you don&#039;t need around.&nbsp; But I only buy personal amounts and don&#039;t sell -- still, that&#039;s how I see it anyway.

				You guys are missing the fundamental linkability problem with addresses in the block chain. Consider this.<br /><br />All LE has to do is create a buyer account and transfer 0.1 BTC to their address. Then they watch the block chain as the BTC are moved (always in 2 transactions, if you&#039;ve ever watched it) to some other addresses, and then some others. Now they&#039;ve identified addresses in the tumbler, which allows them to identify many more. Some of those addresses will be used to tumble coins from other SR accounts.<br /><br />Theoretically, they could follow the trail backwards from coins entering the tumbler to the point of sale. That&#039;s why you want to anonymize your coins. Is it a real threat? No. I bet there are lots of people who never take the time to read these forums and improve their security, who transfer directly from an exchange to their SR address, and to my knowledge nobody has been busted. LE apparently doesn&#039;t have the time, resources, or inclination to go after low level buyers. <br /><br />But keep in mind that those transactions are stored in the block chain forever, and you never know when LE might get the time, resources or inclination to follow the bitcoin trail back to an exchange that has your info.

				How about Bitcoinfog?

The fee is randomized for each deposit to further obscure linking money going into and out of the Fog.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ive personally used them after making three seperate cash deposits at a bank into three separate accounts generated by Bitcoinfog, which then sends them in randomised, time-separated transactions at random intervals/amounts to whichever account(s) you choose. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />-Diddle

Yes, Bitcoin Fog uses independent wallets and addresses with zero taint between them. But they have to keep a separate database of accounting details to link the two. You transfer 10 BTC into your account and expect to get 10 BTC back (minus the fee). That transition between addresses is not stored in the block chain, which is good, but it is stored in some separate database under Bitcoin Fog&#039;s control. You&#039;re essentially putting your trust in Bitcoin Fog that they aren&#039;t LE, they are not working for LE, and they delete those database entries after the transactions are done.&nbsp; Maybe they do, but we can&#039;t be sure.<br /><br />Blockchain.info also has an anonymization service and they claim to delete the database entries after 6 confirmations. Again, maybe they do, but we can&#039;t be sure.<br /><br />The safest option is to transfer through multiple mixing services. The chances that all of them are operated by LE, or are working for LE, or that they save their logs, are much lower that way.<br /><br />That&#039;s for the uber-paranoid. Keep in mind that no SR buyer has been busted through an analysis of bitcoin transactions, and a lot of people are doing direct transfers. Realistically, this is a minor threat, for now.
