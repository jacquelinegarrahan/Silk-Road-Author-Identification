				1. I have just opened a Wells Fargo account, I am wondering if I can transfer funds directly to mt.gox without that being &#039;illegal&#039; or like monitored/frowned upon by my new bank (wells fargo sometimes under wachovia)<br />Or should I add the account to dwolla, then send that money to mt. gox.. then get my coins. I just think this takes a lot longer with dwolla. Its like a long time. And id rather just send it straight to&nbsp; mt.gox is that do- able/legal for bank account?<br /><br />2. I could not use a Wells Fargo ATM to withdraw money from my Moneywise Visa Debit Card, it has like $300 dollars on it and I can not get it out of the ATM. Should I Just send the money to myself or something? I don&#039;t know how to get money out of account. I was on phone with WU all day. My pin is correct, my information is all correct, unless I am supposed to only use the Western Union ATM to WITHDRAW money, then I have no clue how to get funds out as cash and dont know what to do besides send myself some money in a money transfer. Ugh. Help

				You can indeed send money to mt. gox. Go to funding options and choose &quot;International Wire.&quot; However, this is quite expensive (because it is very fast). My bank charges $75 for international wires.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d recommend adding your bank account to dwolla, waiting for it to be approved, and then put money from dwolla into mt. gox into bitcoin.

				I agree.&nbsp; Dwolla is slow to receive money from your bank account (about five working days).&nbsp; &nbsp;But, what I do is to try and keep a few hundred bucks in Dwolla.&nbsp; Getting money into Dwolla is what takes time.&nbsp; Once the money is in Dwolla it&#039;s only a short period of time before it gets into Silk Road.&nbsp; <br /><br />This way I can buy Bitcoins when the price is low and buy my goods on Silk Road when the price is high.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or, if you don&#039;t want to try and make money off of the Bitcoins, just wait until you find what you want on SL and then convert the money to BTC.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then immediately re-fill the Dwolla account so your ready for your next buy.

				International wire is what I&#039;ve done the few times I transferred money into my Mt. Gox account. The first time it was great, lost about 6 bucks or so to 3rd party processing fees. This last time, I ended up with a whooping $17 being &quot;lost&quot; along the way to greedy banks processing my int&#039;l wire. I might try the Japanese account next time and see if that makes a difference, but if it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m gonna have to go the dwolla way.
