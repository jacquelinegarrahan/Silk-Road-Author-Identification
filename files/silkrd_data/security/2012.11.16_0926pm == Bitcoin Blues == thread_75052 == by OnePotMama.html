				How can I clean up my messy bitcoins without having to sign up for a bunch of different things? First, there were the three overzealous Moneygram workers who ID&#039;d me and wanted ALL of my information to complete the transaction. I finally just purchased some with a toss-away debit card and was told by my roommate to use bitinstant and then wash them through instawallet a few times before sending them to SR. But now a few threads are saying these sites are not undependable and working with LEOs. I&#039;m only looking to buy personal use amounts of green and plan on using the escrow and PGP keys. Is that all enough security? Or do my bitcoins need further washing?<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				If you have not read enough to realize this question is location specific I recommend that you read some of the stickies in the security sub forum then ask more specific questions related to your location

				Some people seem to think LE is behind everything, paranoia runs deep. I don&#039;t believe wallets are the watched by LEO, it would be impossible. And why bother, the bitcoin transaction are all in the public domain in the form of the blockchain info. It is linking an individual to a specific transaction that is the thing that would have to be proved, and that is one reason why bitcoins are used to defeat LE. However some people like to tumble or wash their coins for extra anonymity using a site like:<br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br /><br />

				Thanks for the good advice! I had talked to other people who confirmed to just tumble them through a couple things, and the amount I had this time around was small so its not like I&#039;m raising any red flags and I&#039;m willing to part with it if something happens.

				I figure use Tails and instawallet once or twice, but I kind of agree with previous poster as paranoia seems to have more to do with it than anything else....nobody is sure, we just don&#039;t know, since we don&#039;t have a lot of prior experience...we just sort of bounce around and try different things and come to our own conclusions on just what--and how much--we need to worry about this stuff.&nbsp; If you think LE is really all that interested in individuals than yeah, I&#039;d be washing btc and looking for fake i.d. and all kinds of stuff, if you don&#039;t then it&#039;s less hassle...but I always suggest to new people that they take a few hours and start in the beginning of the Secuirty forums thread and just skim thru the whole thing, as it covers everything in this area from all the different viewpoints...best wishes, I know what a hassle it can be trying to sort all this out, and unfortunately, we don&#039;t all agree on the answers to any of these questions....

Its because the answers are always different depending on who you ask. Honestly, the best threads I&#039;ve read are the ones about avoiding controlled deliveries and what to do if the cops are at your door. Even if you screw up multiple times along the way, knowing how to deal with the end is what will make or break you.
