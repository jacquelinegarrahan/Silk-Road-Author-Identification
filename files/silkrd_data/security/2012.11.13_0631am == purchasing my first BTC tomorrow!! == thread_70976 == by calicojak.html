				I&#039;m excited!&nbsp; ;D<br />I&#039;m buying my coin from a vendor on sr. He will need to know what bitcoin address to send to...I&#039;m assuming I shouldn&#039;t use the sr wallet because of all the shit that has happened? So I need to download an e-wallet and have the vendor send my coin to it? Then I move the coin from my e-wallet to my sr wallet? Is this right so far? How easy is it to move coin from an e wallet to sr wallet? Any charge? Thanks

				Hi,<br /><br />I noticed you were planning on purchasing coin from a vendor on SR.<br />First of all, you do NOT need to have a vendor send coin to your bitcoin address.&nbsp; It just takes longer for the coin to arrive in your account, and the vendor only needs to send the coin to your USERNAME and it will be there in about 5 seconds.<br />Sending coin to a bitcoin address can take up to a couple of HOURS!<br /><br />I am also a BTC vendor, and have been vending coin on SR for more than ONE YEAR and have an excellent record.<br /><br />The things you need to check BEFORE sending ANYONE your moneypak card number:<br />(1)&nbsp; How long have they been on SR?&nbsp; &nbsp;(it will say all this in their profile)<br />(2)&nbsp; Do they have at least 99 percent positive feedback?&nbsp; (if not, forget it and find someone else)<br />(3)&nbsp; If this is a new vendor, beware, and I can&#039;t stress that enough, since new so-called &quot;coin vendors&quot; pop up all the time, steal a whole bunch of moneypak numbers and end up getting away with several thousand dollars before they get their account shut down, which usually takes a few days, since everyone is thinking they might still come thru - well, they DON&#039;T.<br />(4)&nbsp; How much is this vendor charging you for their services?&nbsp; Check MtGox.com and see what the &quot;weighted average&quot; price for coin is.&nbsp; That is a fair price to charge for coin, since that is the average amount that is the MARKET PRICE for Bitcoins.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get any coin vendor tell you they charge X amount per BTC, only to find out that it&#039;s 20 or even 30 percent (or more) over what the market price is for bitcoin.&nbsp; Some of them do this, and the new people don&#039;t know that they are getting ripped off, basically.<br /><br />I am not saying you should change to anyone else, and am not doing anything here but trying to help you not lose your coin.<br />I charge 10 percent for all transactions from $100 to $499, and only 15% for transactions under $100, with just a $20 minimum.<br /><br />Some say I am the lowest priced bitcoin on SR, and I could send you scores of references if need be, but nonetheless, I hope this info helps you to make a good deal and get the most for your hard-earned money!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Enjoy!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Hmmm so why do people go through btc vendors if you can get cheaper rates somewhere else? Conveinance? That&#039;s what I was doing it for....But from what you say its 3.99% from bitinstant? I thought you have to buy the coin through mt gox and use bitinstant to fund your mt gox account and then purchase your coin through gox? Is that right?

				Go to bitinstant. Choose moneygram, then choose to botcoin wallet. Go to moneygram location, make the payment for 2.95 plus 3.99 percent and you will have coin in your wallet by the time you get home. Also you can have it sent to Mtgox as cash then send it to a bitcoin address after purchasing bitcoin with cash at mtgox.

				3.95 fee. so if you want to deposit 300 in your wallet, it will be 303.95 and you will bet 288 in your wallet of choice worth of bitcoin. its easy.

				So what&#039;s the pros and cons of buying coin through gox? In other words why would someone use bitinstant to fund their mt gox account to buy coin and not just buy direct from bitinstant?

				EXACTLY!! why use mtgox? no reason unless choices are limited by bitunstant to force you to do it. which they are not at the moment. so go to cvs, walmart, walgreens, albertsons with the print out info, will out the blue form i believe and send it to the bitinstant through MG payment for 3.95 to your wallet and for about 5% or less you will have your money. deposit 500 for 503.95 and get 480.00 worth of coin in your wallet directly.
