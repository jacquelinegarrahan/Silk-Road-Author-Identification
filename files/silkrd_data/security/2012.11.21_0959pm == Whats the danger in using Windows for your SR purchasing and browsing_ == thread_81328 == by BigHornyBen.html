				Hey Guys<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to the road - been lurking on the forums for the last 6-8 weeks reading up on what I needed to learn to use safely, bitcoin, Tor etc.<br /><br />I think I have an OK setup on everything.&nbsp; Happy with my bitcoin purchases &amp; tumbling (LocalBitCoins (Clearnet) --&gt; EasyWallet (Tor)--&gt; BitCoinFog -&gt;EasyWallet (Tor)-&gt; SilkRoad)<br /><br />I tried to use Liberte - but I have a laptop - and from researching there appears to be known issues with my-brand-of-laptop and using Liberte.&nbsp; It kept crashing for me - it was pretty much unusable, crashing anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 mins after joining the local wifi network.<br /><br />Thus I am stuck using my windows 7 laptop for all my purchasing activity.&nbsp; I have taken a few precautions:<br /><br />All my SR related software (Tor Browser, GPG4USB) and any links I have saved are all stored in a TrueCrypt Encrypted volume container, with a 16+ character fully random password.<br />I have my windows swap file set to delete each time I shutdown the PC ( I read somewhere that the swap file is a risk as it can store some info about past activity).<br />I tried to completely disable my swapfile - but the PC keeps running out of memory.<br /><br />I don&#039;t use a local Bitcoin client - I use all eWallets.<br /><br />I always dismount the SR-containing volume container when I am not on SR.<br /><br />Can anyone offer advice on what the risks are with using my Windows 7 laptop as the PC on which I do all my SR activity?&nbsp; <br />Could I be doing anything better, assuming I&#039;m stuck with Windows?<br /><br />I have not yet encrpyted my system-partition using truecrypt, but its on my todo list!<br /><br />Also&nbsp; - I am only (and will ever only be) purchasing personal amounts.<br />

				If your running windows be sure to get PeerBlock 1.1, this will keep MS from sending your entire harddrive, and every thing you do to the NSA

				Have you tried Tails instead of liberte?<br />I think you re absolutely fine though, wouldn&#039;t worry more for that, there are trickiest parts of the road than OS. <br />Encrypt your whole disk like you said you will, I highly recommend that, not only for SR but in case you lose your laptop and don&#039;t want private data exposed.<br />Welcome!

				Windows can be hacked remotely.&nbsp; So can linux, or any other OS that you connect to the internet, for that matter, but Windows is by far the easiest.&nbsp; There was the big thing about the NSA-Key in earlier versions, which people think basically indicates there is a back door built in for government use.&nbsp; Microsoft is fairly friendly with the government with these kinds of issues.&nbsp; Simply the act of using Tor could be a red flag that would get them to look into your computer.&nbsp; Even if it isn&#039;t a built-in capability, the feds have some real experts working for them so if they look at you, chances are they can get in to your system if you are using Windows.

				Liberte sucks, tor is uber slow on it and you cant install any other softwares without having to roll your own build, documentation is poor and theres no support. <br /><br /><br />Windows is a major security risk, it doesnt take much for someone to scan your ports and get access to your machine, and most windows software is really insecure and has tons of exploits. All you need is one virus trojan or backdoor to gain access and your fucked, they scan take screenshots or live video and put keyloggers, in addition to replacing your antivirus/firewall with an identical looking but empty version of itself and you&#039;d never know you were getting fucked. <br /><br />Dont take the risk, boot liveCD everytime.
