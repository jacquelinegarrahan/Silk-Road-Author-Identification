				Hey all,<br /><br />I recently purchased bitcoins via a moneygram order. I had the coins delivered to my email via coinapault. When I tried to send my coins to my wallet on SR using the address supplied to me, they were never received. Its been four or five days now and I haven&#039;t received the coins. I contacted support on SR and they said they&#039;ve never seen the address even though it&#039;s still the address that my account tells me to deposit bitcoins to. The people at bitinstant said their side of the transaction has been completed and to check with SR. Has this happened to anyone before? Any tips on how to get my coins or money back? Is it lost for good? Thanks in advance

				Nothing really other than the fact that the coins had been withdrawn. They&#039;re trying to find where the address is from because support on SR had never seen it before. Its just a long waiting game of seeing where these coins went because they havent been in my account.
