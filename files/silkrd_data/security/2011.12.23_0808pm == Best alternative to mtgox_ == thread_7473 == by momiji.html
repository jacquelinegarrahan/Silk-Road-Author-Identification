				Hey everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in becoming an up and coming LSD seller here. I have all of the pieces of the puzzle to securely sell except one, so I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice:<br /><br />Basically, because of bitcoin&#039;s instability I want to quickly convert all bit coins made to USD via some sort of trading platform, much like mtgox. The problem is mtgox doesn&#039;t seem to want to work with me when it comes to tor. I tried creating an account and none of the emails went to my tormail.net email. I could try creating an account via safe-mail.net, I guess. But even then, I&#039;m not sure how mtgox handles when used through tor.<br /><br />So is mtgox fine, or is there a better alternative I can use? I know this is a bit of an opinionated question, but regardless I&#039;m grateful for any advice.<br /><br /><br />Thank you,<br />Momiji

				You want to steer clear of MtGox.&nbsp; The people running MtGox are working closely with the DEA to keep track of people who might be using Bitcoins for unapproved activities.&nbsp; You can&#039;t log in to MtGox from Tor because all Tor exit nodes are rejected by the MtGox website.&nbsp; Plus, last time I checked, MtGox required most users to provide copies of state-issued ID in order to do things like withdraw Bitcoins from the website.&nbsp; <br /><br />A lot of folks seem to like Tradehill, but I don&#039;t know if they also now require ID.&nbsp; I know that Intersango does not require ID and can be accessed via Tor.&nbsp; How safe it is to keep your &#039;coins there I can&#039;t say.&nbsp; That seems to be the real problem ~~ the established Bitcoin sites seem to want users to give up all their anonymity, and the newer sites like Intersango are O.K. with anonymous users, but who knows if they&#039;ll just disappear one day with your money.&nbsp;

				Intersango are excellent, deposit cash in their account w/ your own unique ref.no that they give you and a day or 2 later there in your account.<br /><br />no fees or long processing delays or any bullshit like that, in fact if they weren&#039;t around I probably wouldn&#039;t be here as every alternative available to me seems to be a pain in the arse or involve 12 different steps.

				As long as you are using fake or stolen papers and prepaid mobile internet access, you are virtually safe even with mtgox. Mt.Gox did not ask for any papers or whatsoever, it was easier than registering in private torrent tracker. Paxum for withdrawals are different, but they don&#039;t check the submitted papers properly, you can get trough with fake low-res ID.<br /><br />Do they really follow the movement of bitcoins? For me this seems the only way to link Silk Road to seller&#039;s mt.gox account. For that to work, the Silk Road&#039;s sending addresses must be known.

				Thanks for the offer, but that isn&#039;t what I&#039;m looking for yet.<br /><br />What I meant was something I could convert into USD from bit coin, then back to bit coin again, as my supplier is buying via bit coin.<br /><br />Once I have enough saved up I&#039;ll then worry about cashing out, and I&#039;ll def consider you.

				momiji.<br />Was reading a few posts on Bitcoin Exchanges. Lots&#039; of good Forums on that.&nbsp; I’ve tried 4 different Trade Exchanges and I personally have an affinity to CampBx. You can establish the account on-line. They require No Id or copy of utility bills like the rest. Just a User ID and an email where they send confirmations. I send in Money Orders weekly and simply reference my User ID and email. I then place a Limit Order ( My Buy or Sell Order for Dollars or BC’s only executes when BC hits a certain Price, right now my Limit is 2.99 to Buy) If your patient, the Price will hit and all the Dollars you placed will Buy at that price. There’s also no fee for Transferring BC’s. If your Selling BC’s for Dollars, once your BC’s sell you can transfer to place where you can get Paper money. At moment I&#039;m completely sober and you can Quote me later, but I think BC&#039;s will Pass 5 in next 30 days.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				At least you can give legal documents, transfer the coins, then delete the account. From there who knows how long they will save the information, but you can always remove the money trail easily with bit coins.

				Most USA based exchanges will require paperwork and id only once you hit a certain withdraw level in total. Until your total withdraws hit the legal limit, they&#039;re not required to ask for anything. I believe the limit is $10,000 or so. Some exchanges ride LE nutsack though so may ask for it much earlier.

				I was under the impression there was a limit on MtGox as well, but I was only transferring 100 Bitcoins?&nbsp; Itried SR and my BitCoin Wallet, and received the same message on both stating I needed to verify my account?&nbsp; <br /><br />I went to Chase today and I am attempting a $200 cash transfer to GetBitCoin.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see how it goes there.&nbsp; In the mean time, I had to send my documents to MtGox.&nbsp; I have only $504 in the account but I could not even get it back to Dwolla?&nbsp; <br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll wait the &quot;upt to 5days&quot; for them to process my paperwork and then I;ll send it back to Dwolla to cash out.&nbsp;

				Can they track which wallet addresses are part of SR?<br /><br />Only if SR is busted. This would most likely happen through some sort of exploit and someone would get access to the site without SR even knowing. From there that person could start logging what goes through SR.<br /><br />The chance is wildly rare, but it is still a possibility. I recommend dropping MtGox and dumping the bit coin addresses you&#039;ve used with them. I have no idea how long MtGox will keep your information after you close your account, but unless there is an active investigation for you currently, the chances are the information will be long gone by the time any leo comes looking. However, if you don&#039;t close your account that information will stay there, which scares the shit out of me.<br /><br />Good luck, and stay safe.

				I need to try CampBX.&nbsp; I set up an account when I first had the MG issues, but went with GetBitCoins instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what the f#$@ is up with BTC today?&nbsp; $5.30?!!&nbsp; I used to do some stock options trading.&nbsp; Maybe I need to get more on the financial side vs consumer side.&nbsp; Freaking crazy.&nbsp; <br /><br />To &quot;hedge&quot; some, I am considering going back to MG and purchasing some BTC, but only for the financial trading side.&nbsp; I would NEVER use the BTC I purchased there to take to SR.&nbsp;

				I just barely signed up a couple weeks ago. Sent my 1st BTC to Mtgox, and then tried to send them to SR, was asked to scan my ID, or send a utility bill in. I didn&#039;t want to, but I can&#039;t sell them, or send them until I do so. It&#039;s fucked up. So, I sent them my ID. Guess I will have to dump all that shit once I get them moved. <br />I read another thread that said Tradehill was denying BTC transactions to SR. Is this possible, or real?<br />Thanks

				Seems like it! Never read any warnings otherwise. What&#039;s the point of anonymity, then?

				From my understanding........Since doing bitcoin exchanges are legal even on SR the bitcoin exchangers sign up at Mt Gox. Then purchase large amounts of coin for low fee and provide ID info. Then they bring those coin to SR and re-sell at a mark up. Some BitCoin exchangers use sellers and some are sellers themselves while others may purchase from Mt Gox. <br /><br />I think the best thing to do is get to know and trust a seller then purchase coin directly from that seller with a MP code.<br /><br />I purchase ALL my coins through a seller and I get charged no fee and the seller is happy to do it. We both win.

				I came across this one yesterday, www.bitcoin2cash.com, but I know nothing about it.<br /><br />I have no trouble buying bitcoins from get-bitcoin.com but have never tried selling there.
