				Wonderful, insightful compilation I agree. <br /><br />It would be a waste to see it disappear in dark web limbo. True credit belongs to the anonymous authors, though. I merely had an archive of the site before it went down and terabyte was so kind to provide the hidden server to host it. <br /><br />Btw, I particularly love the section on smuggling, so Boss&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />&lt;3z

				Finally!&nbsp; I learned so much from reading thru this site last summer.&nbsp; Most of the info scared the shite outta me, but I learned a lot about how Tor users can lose their anonymity.&nbsp; So glad to see they&#039;re back, and with some new stuff (http://2po5jdzeffv2kyv3.onion/polyfront/dealingwithpigs.html).&nbsp;

				This is great, some of the info regarding smuggling could be updated although maybe posting the best latest techniques isn&#039;t such a good idea, also the LE advice could be more localized on a country by country basis. considering writing a UK LE guide soon myself.

				This is an extraordinary resource. Well done Cpt. Meow! :)&nbsp; *salute*<br /><br />Seriously, this is a gold mine of useful information.
