				I agree.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the feds or cops would spend time hunting down bitcoin transactions for petty drug sales EVEN IF they had the network tools and legal framework to do so.&nbsp; As nobody has provided me with that information, I&#039;m guessing most people on here are just have a low tolerance to the anxiety of drug-dealing.&nbsp; Doing it in the street is MUCH more stressful and dangerous!&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine this being anything but safe for buyers as long as very basic precautions are taken.
