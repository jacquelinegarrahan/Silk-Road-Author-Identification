				I think it is another move by the people that own so many they have an effect by selling loads of coins to create a panick, watch when it gets down to, say, 20-30 pounds which is about $50-$60 (I think they will not try to go below that as the true worth of btc must be around that amount now imho).&nbsp; Good time to buy and wait for it to go up again if you have the cash - I will buy if it goes down to 25 pounds.<br /><br />If it does go to $10 it will be worth maybe buying a shitload

				The current price is at about the same level of the earlier part of the bubble, and the smaller post-bubble rebound. I think a lot of would-be long term investors who showed up to the game a little too late are now selling off their coins in order to prevent losses. There&#039;s been over a month of a general declining trend, so they must have firm worries about prices in the future.

				Dammit.<br />I purchased BTC earlier this week for $90, and by the time I get it it&#039;ll be worth $60. Hell yea! Take that, druggie!<br />I always seem to have an uncanny ability to buy high and sell low in everything I do. Oh well, it&#039;s a gift.<br />I&#039;ll have to find a quicker way to aquire BTC in the future. Guess I&#039;ll give LocalBitcoins a try.
