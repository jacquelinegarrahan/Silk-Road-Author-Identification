				I recently received an email from BitInstant that a cash deposit had been made in my MtGox account. I have not used bitinstant in 2+ months and I did not make this deposit. While it is less than $1000 USD, it is still a substantial amount. I have not yet purchased any bitcoins with this mystery money and thus have not done anything illegal with it concerning SR purchases.<br /><br />I have not received any phone calls or emails from either bitinstant or mtgox concerning the error. What should i do? How long should I leave the money there before I attempt to deposit it in my bank account? The only thing I have decided is not to purchase any bitcoins with it.

If you have not made a deposit into your account then quite simply, it&#039;s not your money! Were you ever sent emails previously when making purchases? Not touching it was a smart move by you. I would immediately email bitinstant and MtGox, using Tormail, and demand they remove the money &quot;accidentally&quot; deposited in your account immediately and email you a written explanation outlining what happened. It could be a mistake but on the other hand, it could be an attempt to gather info. Do you transfer coins directly to SR or to a wallet installed on your PC? If you don&#039;t get a response or one that is plausible, I would delete your account and look into other methods of obtaining bitcoins, at least for the time being. Very suspicious activity.&nbsp; :-\

				I would buy bitcoins with it, put it through a scrambler (like Bitcoinfog) and deposit the coins in another wallet (like Intersango) than send money to your bank account :) If I&#039;m not mistaken the money by now is virtually untraceable. <br /><br />Needs some verification but I&#039;m pretty sure.
