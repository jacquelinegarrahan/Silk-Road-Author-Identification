				Hi guys, I&#039;ve been watching for a while and decided it&#039;s time to dip my toe in the water.<br /><br />First let me just say this is a wonderful community and I&#039;m glad it exists and well done to you all for being a part in it.<br /><br />I&#039;m wanting to make a small order from the UK to a vendor from the netherlands. The order will be for about £30 worth.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot about ways to buy bitcoin with cash, but they all seem to be from the US and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a way to do it from the UK. So I assume people from the UK are just using bank transfers in their name to buy bitcoin. I&#039;m wondering if it would be enough security to put the coin through some instawallets and bitcoin fog even though I&#039;ve bought them originally using my own name.<br /><br />I know security is important for my own safety and for the overall community and I don&#039;t want to seem rash, but the way I see it is this will probably be my only order and it&#039;ll be for 5 tabs of LSD. How likely am I to get caught and what are the chances that if I am caught it will be pursued ? Are these big security measures just for heavy users and paranoids or am I being over eager and need to do more?<br /><br />If I do need to do more if anyone from the UK could suggest a good way of acquiring bitcoin I&#039;d be very grateful.<br /><br />Cheesecakefactory.

				Chance of getting caught for LSD?<br /><br />0.00001%<br /><br />I&#039;m being serious.<br /><br />In terms of buying coin.. You can buy it on here for western union/moneygram etc but there have been several scams as of late.. There&#039;s a guy v1adimir or something to that effect on these forums who offers a bitcoin for cash in the post service. If you use tracked delivery you are safe, and he is a reputable guy. That is probably your most anonymous option but will take longer than using an exchange.<br /><br />You could just buy from mtgox/intersango (intersango is quicker), and then send it straight to SR/through a couple wallets (seems pretty suspicious to me). A lot of people do that and haven&#039;t been caught but if you&#039;re more security conscious then just put it through bitcoinfog and you&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br /><br />

You&#039;ll find a link at the bottom of this message to my thread where I explain how it works in detail.<br /><br />Obtaining Bitcoins safely is one thing, making sure your computer is set up in such a way that you don&#039;t leave any fingerprints is important as is mastering GPG. By all means send me a message and I&#039;ll give you the lowdown before we set up your order.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.
