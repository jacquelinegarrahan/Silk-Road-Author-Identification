				Lets say someone has been investing in bitcoins for a while, and has about 800BTC. They decide they want to get that as cash, in a safe and anonymous way. What method or transaction path would the experts here recommend? <br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Ok, except that would defeat the whole purpose of the road; I would have to deal with other drug users!<br /><br />Here&#039;s an idea:<br /><br />Put the coins in bitcoin fogger for a few days/weeks --&gt; an exchange that connects to a service that has prepaid anonymous visa --&gt; withdraw money from different ATMs using the anonymous card over a period of months.<br /><br />How safe would that be? Thanks.

				orngecapsule,<br /><br />I read that post in depth a few hours ago, thanks very much for sharing it! I learned quite a lot from it, about blockchain.info, bitcoin fog, etc., so thanks.<br /><br />My location isn&#039;t USA at the moment, so afaik bitinstant is off limits for me. Also, it seems like a very smooth, anonymous and easy way to get money into SR, but I don&#039;t exactly see how to use it to get cash out of &nbsp;SR. If you could enlighten me on how I can use it for that purpose, I would be delighted&nbsp; :D

				In general, it depends on what country you&#039;re in.&nbsp; You need to find someone, somewhere, who has your local currency and wants bitcoins.<br /><br />I would check the following pages for the currency you want.<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;- This is a directory of people who live near you and want to trade.&nbsp; Depending on where you live, your mileage may vary.&nbsp; If there are no official exchanges available in your country or at least available anonymously, there might be plenty of people waiting.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Selling_bitcoins &lt;- Comprehensive list. If no one wants your coins nearby, use one of these vendors.&nbsp; If your coins are anonomized, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about merchants knowing your identity, because they shouldn&#039;t be able to figure out what your coins did.&nbsp; I personally use a mainstream, taxpaying business on this list, because it is well organized and efficiently offers services at a low cost in my area.&nbsp; You may have to shop around.
