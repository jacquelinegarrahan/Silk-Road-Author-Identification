				I took shrooms through security in my carry on when I went on a little trip a few weeks ago. I crushed up 6 grams of shrooms into a powder and got a bag of sunflower seeds. I then dumped out the seeds and put the shroom powder in the bottom of the bag then I put all the seeds back in the bag and put the seeds in my carry on. I got through security no problem.

				Can you get trafficking charges for taking LSD on a flight?&nbsp; Like a felony?&nbsp; Just internationally or domestic too?&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I&#039;ll drive.

				I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s piss easy if you&#039;re flying domestic, and if you don&#039;t look like the stereotypical drug user, and you research the proper methods, usually you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; But mailing it would probably be safer.&nbsp; I was wondering about bringing molly on a plane, because I won&#039;t know where to get any where I&#039;ll be traveling.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard people say you can put them in supplement capsules and you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d feel that uncomfortable bringing a few blotters on a domestic flight if I could stick them in a paperback.&nbsp; But would it matter if that book were in my carry-on or my checked luggage?&nbsp; Bringing MDMA on a plane, on the other hand, scares the shit out of me.&nbsp; But I know heaps of people who have gotten weed, coke, paraphernalia, and even MDMA through domestic security.

				I took weed in my check bag on a 3 hour domestic flight.&nbsp; I broke it in to shake and compressed it - it was about 3g.&nbsp; Put it in multiple baggies and was careful about getting resin on the bags.<br /><br />I smashed it into a box with a jar of hair goo.&nbsp; Stuck that in my wife&#039;s toiletries with her vibrator (figured that would distract the xray screener).&nbsp; I was nervous, but it worked out.&nbsp; What we didn&#039;t smoke, we left behind.<br /><br />My wife&#039;s brother (I wasn&#039;t with him) took a joint in his cigarette box and carried it on with him.&nbsp; He got stopped by TSA on the way in.&nbsp; They pulled it out, shook their heads and threw it away.&nbsp; But I would think that would be extreme luck - or he&#039;s lying.&nbsp; He is enough of an idiot to try to smuggle a spleef, so that part is believable.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ll never know...
