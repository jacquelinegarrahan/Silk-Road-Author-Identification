				So one of the big questions for us new vendors which is often asked about is how to safely cash out our bitcoins. Just cashing out with an exchanger seems problematic both because the exchanger will ask questions when the seems are sufficiently high and if you then transfer this money to your bank account those transactions might awake the suspicion of authorities. Now I have noted that there probably are alternatives that we don&#039;t speak openly about in forum threads and that anyways is for those with a much greater cashflow then my own. So I&#039;d like to discuss a few of the less advanced alternatives that are available for purchase here on SR. Feel free to add alternatives other then those I will mention here.<br /><br />First there is the anonymous bank account/credit card that can be bought here on SR, like this one:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/0a0cce6879<br />or this one:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/123f2d69ed&nbsp; (btw whats up with this one costing like almost 4 times as much as the first one?)<br /><br />Now here the problem is how to get your cash anonymously to the credit card.<br /><br /><br />Second we have options like western union, like this one:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/ef8a404a9f<br /><br />Here the problem is that you have to show ID when picking up the cash so the question is how much of a risk that is.<br /><br /><br />What do you think about these options for cashing out BTC? Any information would be greatly appreciated.
