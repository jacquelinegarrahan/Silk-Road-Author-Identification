				Bitinstant is a reliable source for getting bitcoins but the 3.99% is too much to bear. <br />Transferring $500 actually only gets you $480 ... it doesnt seem like much but it adds up!<br />Anyone know of any other ways of obtaining bitcoins for an inexpensive fee?

				Thanks Lubriderm.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought from Sugar Mama about 4 times totaling close to 2K with no problems, just the 10-12% fee that I want to move beyond.&nbsp; I will do more research.&nbsp;

				If you want to buy Bitcoin, why don&#039;t you buy it &quot;face to face&quot;?<br />I know, some of us are really paranoid, so send a friend, someone else etc.<br />I think it&#039;s the cheapest way to get Bitcoin and you don&#039;t have to support fucked up sites / corporations etc.

				Exactly what Deutsche Bank said. Look on localbitcoins.com <br /><br />Its not sketchy at all and most of the people that site are speculators. I am sure a bunch of people are selling coins right now since the price is so high.

				#bitcoin-otc is pretty good. Takes a bit of setting up and you do risk being scammed if you don&#039;t use it properly (read up on it, use the web of trust) but you&#039;re buying from individuals rather than through corporations. Cash in the post or face to face is the best method IMO, but you won&#039;t find anyone doing that cheaply and it&#039;s not like you can just transfer funds with a click of a button.

				I&#039;ve always used bitinstant for my bitcoin transactions; it&#039;s wonderful if you&#039;re doing small transactions up to probably 1000 bucks. The only large transaction I did which was for 400 dollars netted about a 20 - 30 dollar fee, but the funds are in your account within an hour after going down to Wal-Mart and filling out the moneygram transfer. Plus a lot of convinience stores do moneygram so if anonymity is your thing then you can jump around. Although the transactions go to a company, so it doesn&#039;t scream illegitimacy when you use the service.

I used them because of the anonymity and ease of transaction for cash deposits.<br />Now they require wayyy too much info to make a purchase for coins. They want email addresses and names. Then when I tried using the cash deposit it forces me to use ZipZap, which then wants even more info. When I tried to deposit the money anonymously for a Moneygram, they required ID, address, phone number everything.<br />&nbsp;I tried 3 diff. locations and they required the same thing.&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />Anyone else have a better way to buy BTC anonymously? I mean I can walk into any store with cash and buy items, why do they need all my info to buy BTC....

And even then there&#039;s only one or two in the area.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been asked for my ID on a moneygram transfer, and really I don&#039;t see why it would matter... If you send your coins through enough wallets then how the hell are they going to get anything? SR may be a big part of BTC&#039;s use, but it&#039;s not all of it. Someone buying bitcoin is not a reason to suspect them of some darker thing. I get that the whole anonymity thing is important and all, but I really think that if you do right by the BTC when you get them into your wallet and wash them nice and clean where they can&#039;t be traced back to you ( which I don&#039;t see how they could be traced back to you in the first place ) I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d worry. Even if you&#039;re putting a few thousand dollars into it, moneygram is used for bills as well as sending money to people. You don&#039;t have to tell the people that are handling your moneygram anything other than &quot;it&#039;s for a bill&quot; and what can they do? <br /><br />I mean, all in all, I think that considering you&#039;re getting drugs shipped to your residence, the odd-chance that someone might be suspicious of your moneygram is the absolute least of your worries.

				If you want a cheaper method then 4% + static fee (~4$ if I remember moneygram fee being...), you can try other cash vendors (only save $$$ if buying low quantities of BTC where the flat fee isn&#039;t spreadout as much...<br /><br />- Blue Sky Traders (http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion.to/index.htm) : Bank of America direct deposit<br /><br />- Bitcopia (https://bitcopia.com/index.php):&nbsp; Wells Fargo direct deposit - I just used this service the other day, fast but WF did mess up with info and for faster service I had to email pic of receipt.&nbsp; They charge a 5% no flat fee...<br /><br />Other then some of those, you can try local... though prices are higher in my area by ~1$ per coin.<br /><br />Otherwise you have to use a more trackable/legit method...&nbsp; Though remember you will HAVE to mix coins for an additional 1-3% (blockchain.info is 1.5% flat) because they almost require verification of identity.<br /><br />Dwolla-&gt;MtGox:&nbsp; Takes 30 days to setup, have to verify with photo id/utility bill.&nbsp; Dwolla charges $0.25 for transfers of funds (you fund dwolla with your own bank account), MtGox charges &lt;0.6%.&nbsp; Benefit here is you can get the most current BTC pricing, you can even set buy orders if price reaches a certain level.&nbsp; Takes a week from funding to BTC generally.<br /><br />https://coinbase.com:&nbsp; Again you have to fund with your own bank account.&nbsp; They charge 1% for purchases, they front you the $$ to buy at current MtGox+1% rate then deliver BTC once your bank transfer clears, about a week later (they give accurate date/time of BTC delivery).&nbsp; Cool thing is this is a one stop shop, you don&#039;t have to fund somewhere then transfer to exchange/btc vendor.&nbsp; They do not require ID verification but only fund with checking account.&nbsp; Limits of 10BTC a day purchases until 30 days which is raised to 100 a day.

				There is a lot of bad advice here.<br /><br />Your best bet is Dwolla then mtgox. It doesn&#039;t take 30 days. Took me less than one week. The fee is about 25 cents per transaction.

I guess there was a big dwolla/btc scam going...&nbsp; I guess they have it straightened out now.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t forget the MtGox fee for buying the BTC... it starts at .6% and goes down based on amount purchased I think...

				graham, im on the site now, i have read all the FAQ&#039;s. i cant figure out how to message a seller. What im trying to find out is if i need say $500 in an account how much cash do i need to give to the person? Could i do $5k in one day or is there a limit and they can flag or freeze your account? also, is there any issues with doing it in person or would you reccomend using there escrow service....which i guess wouldnt work for me as i need BTC and am not selling it so that is pointless for me.
