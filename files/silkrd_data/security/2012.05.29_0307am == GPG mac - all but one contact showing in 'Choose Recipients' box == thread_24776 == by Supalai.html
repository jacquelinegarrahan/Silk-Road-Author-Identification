				so I have finally figured out the GPG for mac and have imported my fav vendors public keys<br /><br />they all imported ok, but when i try to encrypt my message there is one vendor that does not appear in the &#039;Choose Recipients&#039; box<br /><br />I have re-imported this vendors key a few times and still not showing up?<br /><br />does this mean there is something up with his key? all others are working fine..<br /><br />any help appreciated<br /><br />cheers

				Bumping this because I&#039;m having the same problem as the OP.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been able to encrypt my messages when placing orders with no problem up until now.&nbsp; Only today, when I was getting ready to place an order, did I have the issue of the recipient to whom I was trying to message not showing up in the &#039;Choose Recipients&#039; dialogue window when highlighting the text in TextEdit and selecting Services &gt; Open PGP: Encrypt Selection.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone have any idea why this may be happening?&nbsp; Could it have something to do with the format in which the vendor&#039;s public key is imported into GPG Keychain Access?<br /><br />This is fucking annoying.

				Upon further investigation, it seems that the only recipients that aren&#039;t showing in the &quot;Choose Recipients&quot; box are those that use an email service other than Tormail.&nbsp; Anyone know why this happens?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				I believe the common Mac GUIs for GPG only let you select keys by E-mail instead of username, so if a vendor doesn&#039;t have an E-mail attached to their key it will not display. Stupid design. Can you see usernames as well or only E-mail addresses?

				I&#039;ve also wondered lately, but simply have not had the time, if it is possible to change the name of an imported public key as displayed in GPG Keychain Access?<br /><br />When using Keychain Access, if you don&#039;t note the name/email of the unique key you are importing &#039;exactly&#039; at the time it is being imported, it can be a lot of (un)fun trying to figure out who it belongs to. Especially if neither the name or email matches the &#039;actual&#039; name/email you were expecting.<br /><br />
