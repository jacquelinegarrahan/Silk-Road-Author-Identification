				Ive been wondering for a while now which would be the best way to go about opening an anon box for mainly weed.<br />What will i need/need to do?<br />Will fake passports of wiki sites do the job?<br /><br />Also while im here how often do packages from Canada to the UK get caught at customs?

				When I set up my box with Mail Boxes Etc they needed two forms of photo ID, one of which had to be a passport. On their website they say they run security checks as well so fake IDs might get you in trouble there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t really worry about getting an anonymous box though. I&#039;ve had a couple that I&#039;ve had drugs sent to and unless the packaging is careless then they&#039;ll just be another envelope to the people working there. Unless your shipping ounces of weed, which I probably wouldn&#039;t risk&nbsp; doing.

				There are a lot of companies that do PO box / Virtual office / mail redirection services. Some will accept scanned or photocopied ID.

				An anonymous PO box is a dead give away if you&#039;re caught with weed. You&#039;d also risk additional charges.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know UK law, but they can&#039;t prove you ordered the weed if you&#039;re caught with it. I&#039;d try to raise as little suspicion as possible.

				A friend of mine will be vending here in the next 5 days or so, one of the things he&#039;ll be offering is to set up an anonymous mail box.<br />Just a heads up, might be worth keeping an eye on the market place.

				You cant get an anonymous box unless you plan on going to a mom and pop shop where they have no cameras+don&#039;t require any identification. I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s legal, just order it to your fucking house.
