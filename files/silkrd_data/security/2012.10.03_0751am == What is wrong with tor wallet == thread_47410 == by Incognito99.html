				I have been trying to pass my BTC along from torwallet for over 24 hours now but all I get is:<br />Hot wallet exhausted. Please wait while we move coins in from our offline wallet.<br /><br />This is stressing me out big times. Anyone else had the same problems? I need those BTC!

				My last one took 36 hours and I missed out on the listing I sought. They finally came in and I found something better. You will be more relaxed after you will have a couple successes.

Never heard of no mixing option. Maybe one of the more experienced here will add. However, unless you start to see similar users posting on this same problem, I&#039;d venture to guess it&#039;s just a waiting game.

He has stopped allowing funds to be transfered out of the hot wallet, only in. Luckily I only have 5BTC stuck there as it was one of my &quot;burner wallets&quot;. Don&#039;t give an anonymous internet user money that you aren&#039;t willing to lose. My reccomendation would be to create an offline wallet that you can store the majority of your coins in and only put your &quot;play money&quot; on an online wallet like blockchain.info. They have an amazing wallet service, and it&#039;s not like torwallet/instawallet in that you have your own wallet address not just one giant shared one. Also the secret key is known to you and you alone, so even if they wanted to blockchain couldn&#039;t move your BTC.

				I just lost over $200 to TORwallet.&nbsp; It really sucked because I made the deposit like a week after it was first reported that there were issues.&nbsp; I am now using bitcoin fog instead.&nbsp; Hopefully they don&#039;t do the same thing.&nbsp; I have now been checking the boards before I make any transfers to make sure there are not any new events to change my mind about their service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Funny thing was I usually transfer smaller transactions so that if something like this was to happen it wouldn&#039;t hurt as bad.&nbsp; The one time I send more than $100 through TORwallet the damn thing eats my money.
