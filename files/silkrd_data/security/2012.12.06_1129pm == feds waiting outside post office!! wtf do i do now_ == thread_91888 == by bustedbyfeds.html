				If it were me, and if that p.o. box was rented with my real ID, I would want to purge that sucker (the package, not the cop. well, both, I suppose). I&#039;d bring a sharpie, head on over to my box, open it up, spend all of five seconds giving the package a &quot;WTF?&quot; look, then whip out the marker and write RETURN TO SENDER on it. Close up the box, stride over to the counter, and hand the package in. I would ensure I take not one step with that package in my hands without that already written on it. <br /><br />If someone is sending you, I don&#039;t know, solid fricking gold, and you want to try something a little trickier, I&#039;d send myself a package to the same box, first. Then hit my box with the same marker, mark RETURN TO SENDER on the original package but leave it in my box, then try to walk out with the package I sent (tucked out of sight under my arm) and see what happens. <br /><br />If you have no real connection to the box and the loss isn&#039;t too dear, walk away, friend.

				So you know this guy. How? How do you know he&#039;s a cop? Has he had contact with you before in the course of an investigation?

				That is for real.&nbsp; I got busted once and two days before I saw a guy in an umarked car rip those off his head when he saw me coming.&nbsp; Also I saw a cop using them outside my alley once six hours a guy got busted who whose last text was to me about oz. of shrooms.&nbsp; Also right before I got busted my phone got hung up on by some third party as soon as you could tell the conversations were not about drugs or after I was done talking about drugs it would hang up and I would have to call back.&nbsp; Not before or since has a phone acted like that except when a couple months later I was tying up some loose ends and it started up again.&nbsp; Also the looks by dudes outside - I lived in the city - I know now they like to do that shit.&nbsp; Btw they totally hang out in their trucks and off duty vehicles.&nbsp; They are cops.&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp; Also they are a little like criminals - and yes some are.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been lucky enough to not get caught up in that.&nbsp;

				I missed where it says anyone was waiting for days. Seems to me that the OP went to pick up a package, and was smiled at by a fed, because they know each other. Also, aren&#039;t there a bunch of reasons why a fed might be outside?&nbsp; Waiting for another fed to mail a letter or buy some milk? Pulled over to listen to some particularly moving music though his over-sized headphones? Stopped to-<br />Shit, better go, there&#039;s a squirrel looking at me funny through the window.

				Use some common sense. If you know he is a cop, just forget about it. Hope you haven&#039;t used your real name. While the cop could be there for many other reasons other than your package, don&#039;t take the risk if you are concerned. Forget the urge, clean your house and lay low for a while.

				For one was the post office a small sub section or your main facility? If it was the main facility then NOT seeing a fed once in a while would be odd, atleast in the city i live in everytime I go to the main facility there is a cop observing and profiling people as well as multiple unmarked cars coming and going. Its always best to be safe then sorry but honestly if the officer looked at you and smiled he was probably just being nice, LE ESPECIALLY FEDS are extensively trained to NOT alarm or scare ANYONE they are following or observing.<br /><br />If I were you clean house just to be safe, but do not act suspicious dont be affraid to go to the post office, if anything visit more frequently now, get a feel for what has been going on day to day there, if the PO box is in your name have a couple magazines or other LEGAL letters sent to it and pick them up and walk out and see what happens(obviously dont grab the illegal parcel claim you forgot or did not see it if asked) Sure cops can investigate situations but so can we.

I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor.

I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fuckng length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell.

Without a doubt I&#039;ll provoke the disagreement of everyone on this thread when I say that, if it were me, and it was 900.00, I would kick myself if I left it there or it would begin to weigh on me and the more time it is in there the higher the chance of it being discovered by a snooping postal worker. I&#039;d follow the above advice and CAREFULLY.... get.... it. I have an idea about how it could be done a slightly better way, but I&#039;m not sure I fully trust somebody who comes in on a brand new username and immediately asks for suggestions on how to circumvent the feds as his first question on the forum, especially as that name is... &quot;bustedbyfeds&quot;. It only raises the question of why you changed your name in the first place. If you haven&#039;t, and this really is your first time on SR forum, it&#039;s weird how you seem to know your away around the place, in a manner of speaking. Theoretically, it would be the easist thing in the world for a cop to register on SR Forums and.... okay I&#039;m not NECESSARILY accusing anybody of doing that. It&#039;s just, well, some people think users are so easy to full because we&#039;re all so &quot;out of it&quot;.... truth be told we are a hell of a lot more switched on than we&#039;ve give credit for, we have to, it&#039;s the way things work around here; un-&quot;switched on&quot; users get busted.<br /><br />Okay. Just so there&#039;s no misunderstanding. I am NOT saying you may be a cop. I wouldn&#039;t dream of it. But we ask a lot of questions. We have to. Chatting to me over PM isn&#039;t going to make a difference. I just hope you understand and don&#039;t take offense if I sit out on this one and advise people on these forums to think before giving this kind of specific, helpful advice out so freely. Having said that, you may still follow the advice of Gandolf. I weren&#039;t a cop, I&#039;d get that package quite the careful cat. <br /><br />Piece out. Don&#039;t get mad at me btw. It&#039;s my two cents and oh dear fucking god I am entitled to it sweetie.

				This story and other like it are the biggest piles of attention seeking, paranoia spreading bullshit, it is sickening.<br /><br />Cops arent stupid, you cant just trick them going out the backdoor, or walking into a post office and then walking back out. If they have gotten to the point they are waiting on you, they know who you are and at the minimum your getting a knock and talk.<br /><br />Dont buy into the shit people try and spread on here. I have been working in the mail order drug game for 5 years this Spring and some of the childish shit these people write is ludicrous. Thats how you can decipher a true story against a non true story ... if there is theatrical elements to it, its bullshit. CD&#039;s are controlled envrionments. You dont see them coming, they arrest you and your gone in under 2 minutes.

				If the feds are waiting them and you have a lot of money worth of drugs in the package you may be fucked.<br /><br />If the drugs worth less than a million dollars and you are not involved in gang crime then it&#039;s cool dude.<br /><br />Just slip the fbi man a 20 dollar note and he will be your freind.<br /><br />Just put the dollars into his shirt pocket and say &quot;whoa dude look, you got $20 in your pocket, how did that get in there.&quot;<br /><br />He may just take a joints worth from you if you have loads. <br />If you only have a little bit of weed or coke then he will feel sorry for you coz you not got many drugs. In this case he may need a bribe of $50, but should give you some drugs back in return from his personal mafia confiscated stash. Coz he took pity on you.

				What a waste of time and energy in this thread, although entertaining to read the comments.<br />Note to &quot;bustedbyfeds&quot;....it&#039;s called punctuation, you dip-shit, lazy fuck. Your stupid-ass, all lower case, misspelled, not a single period &quot;.&quot; serve to only enhance your reputation as a fucking idiot. You give us newbies a bad rap. You are a stain, please go away.
