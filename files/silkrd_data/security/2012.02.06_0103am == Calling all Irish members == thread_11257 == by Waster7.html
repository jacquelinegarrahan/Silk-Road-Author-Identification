				All you need to know about Ireland is that in the late spring/summer they seize packages like crazy because students are all out of school and have temporary customs positions and they open EVERYTHING<br /><br />As soon as school starts up they go back to their regular useless state, so order up everything you want until school is out

				Waster it is really possible, I have only bought weed and hash myself here in Scotland but packages have come with no problem from Holland and Sweden as well as in the UK for me. They are always well done and looking from the outside you would never know what was in them.<br /><br />Security wise I think there are people who go overboard but what you have done is what I do and I am alright so far :D I purchase bitcoin with my Bank account via Intersango, just put them into another wallet from there before I move them on to SR as well.

Bitcoins is very straightforward although it can seem terribly complicated and scary even to the uninitiated. Bitcoins are pegged to the dollar but you can see them valued against the Euro too on most exchanges. There are two types of exchanges for bitcoins, what I refer to as primary and secondary... a primary exchange (Mtgox being the main one that handles 80% of Bitcoin exchange) is where you deal anonymously and buy directly from the market. Just like buying any foreign currency really.&nbsp; The secondary markets are more like traditional marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet (of which bitmarket.eu is a popular one) and you make an offer to buy and if someone accepts, you transfer funds directly to the seller of the bitcoins.. I have used both sites and dealt both with primary and secondary markets...I think the primary market is better as you get better exchange rates and more fluctuation on price....but on the secondary market, it can be quicker sometimes to get your hands on the bitcoins if you buy from someone in the same country (ive had my coins in under 2 hours before)..on the primary market you can expect to wait a day or two. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank you all.<br /><br />Quite disappointed with the exchange of Euro to Bitcoin, really hoped that it would be something like 3.0 - 3.5 :(<br />Works out even more expensive then buying off a dealer in real life, I was looking to buy E in bulk and extort the high Irish E prices.<br /><br />Is there any ways to make Bitcoins fast?

				Depends on what the seller is offering. Some require registered mail but obfuscate it / provide an alibi.<br />This thread is worth reading http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0<br />The consensus is to use your real name, and address. But of course many will disagree.

				A quick note to say that Canada can be hit and miss. I had a friend who used to get bud from a different (clearnet) site, the service was patchy but most, possibly all, no-shows were during the late spring/summer so that ties in with Derpasaurus. Might&nbsp; be worth noting that she only ever got one customs notice so it might just&#039;ve been sticky fingers on the Canadian side.

				Well lads, what&#039;s the craic?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Very informative thread here and will certainly help me get BTC without using the dodgy BTC vendors on SR. Another website i&#039;ve seen to buy BTC is wm-center.com. Has anyone used it? You have to verify your identity with them though, which may put some people off.<br /><br />As far as ordering and receiving goes, I&#039;ve been buying on SR for a few months now and i&#039;ve had loads of success getting orders from NL. I&#039;ve had MDMA, LSD and pills from there. I always use my real name and get it sent to my own address, or my girlfriends. One package from Amsterdam never made it and the seller said he re-sent it and that never made it either. Other than that, it was all hunky dory. The package that didn&#039;t arrive was actually during the Summer, so that could tie in with a previous poster&#039;s theory about the college student&#039;s being hired by customs during the Summer.<br /><br />For me, the quality of the drugs on here is top notch and much better than everything I can find locally. It also helps with the paranoia when you don&#039;t have to meet dealers on the street!! Waster7, your customers will return for a long time if you sell them premium pills from here. I&#039;d highly recommend the blue defcons...they are BANGING pills :)<br /><br />Take it easy lads and stay safe,<br /><br />Psy<br /><br /><br /><br />

				From Ireland, bought from the road, got bitcoins through cash in the mail (there are a number of people who do it), they sent me the bitcoins and i put them through bitcoinfog before sending them to the road.

				Since the Barclays MTgox account is down I&#039;ve been looking at other ways to purchase.

				Nearing 10 transactions here. I&#039;d avoid buying from the Netherlands completely. 1 of 2 of my orders there were seized and I&#039;ve had to subscribe to a maildrop service because my address is now permanently flagged. Didn&#039;t have any seizure troubles throughout summer, buying mostly small amounts of powder. Research your vendors religiously before committing to a purchase.

				Well if you have covered your tracks, shut the fuck up and cut your losses. <br />If you have not, lay low. <br /><br />Not really a good idea to put it up on a forum where it was seized. <br />They arent the thickest bunch in the world, so they could well deliver it and hopefully give you some time with it, and then nick you with it, ignore the importation charge, and just do you for <br />possession and possession with intent. Wont really come into it there where it came from.

				Someone was asking above about Bitcoins for cash in the post.<br /><br />Probably one of the simplest, safest way of getting Bitcoins is using the anonymous cash in the post option by BitcoinNordic. The cons are that it&#039;s 9% more expensive, and takes 3-4 days.<br /><br />Step by step guide for newbies:<br /><br />Go to bitcoinnordic.com<br />Choose Cash/Check.<br />Use an email address from tormail.org <br />Enter the amount in euros you want to buy.<br />Go to instawallet.org, copy the BTC address you&#039;re given (starts with 1) into the Bitcoin Nordic form.<br />** Make sure you save the instawallet.org/w/.... address which is highlighted in red. This is your only key to your bitcoins, you can&#039;t recover it if it&#039;s lost.<br />The BitcoinNordic site will then give you a reference code and the postal address. Put cash and a note with the reference number on it in an envelope and send it to the BitcoinNordic address in Copenhagen.<br />Give it 3-4 business days and check your Instawallet for the funds. You can then send these to your SR account.<br /><br />(Note: there&#039;s an option on BitcoinNordic form about inside or outside EU. You can choose outside and save a bit on VAT. They have no way of knowing what country your Bitcoins are being received in)

				Howdy lado&#039;s,<br /><br />How can you tell if your address has been flagged?<br />If you&#039;ve used a false name it&#039;d be tough to prove but i suppose one can always get raided.<br />I personally won&#039;t be orderin&#039; from the dam (again). Too dodge. They probly get one bag of mail from there every day and go through it fairly thoroughly for obvious reasons.<br />Not a good idea to use the same address regularly. <br />Be wide.
