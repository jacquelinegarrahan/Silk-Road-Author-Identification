				Hello folks.<br /><br />Some people know this and some don&#039;t, so this is in the nature of a PGP public service announcement.<br /><br />As kmfkewm recently pointed out to a forum poster a ciphertext can have identifiers embedded into it. This is how it works, try this at home with your own PGP key on a test message to see for yourself.<br /><br />Example: <br /><br />This is a PGP ciphertext encrypted to myself using the PGP Club public key.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />hQGMA7pmVyGp4Z9uAQv/Y7fCVqUChMnji1g4Tm4zirTSoBvzoaoB8pmshcFVFYMh<br />Mx0W8fKVrMOU/TxzSjIhaUvVmxRTAF4MxMNrLg7ncTBWVDeBjrOQCNYUMCrGt//d<br />0u/HqWn6EfUCADuaxLd52WmF1CIs2ezXJo6XXfwfJCStiel0tek0vpKINlllXwlx<br />YdgvUZKB3BpE3K2abNfSkaeBHlPvRgUGWI+VAkNpwsNq+y1RXOIVyC0p38Rcpxuv<br />Bp6iMKoxE30SPOVzYR29bCA8I/+/sRvlOSDTKnDEkiFl7/rezheBJT2+OiJlOIkx<br />6wTv1HSeWNtrH9jnOGfGUKUgId0eEyKUgnHh1Z9IJlMqnvCNIUreTuylI4/v0izh<br />5oqA6dHO7S2YPrm1TtDnihBsVrexq6/fv0mBApTR9LChP/0pkDHVKdfkuoUYXjg2<br />E30Je4iyPSnfD1J597/Aqvv+cOlj5JyAkQ2vFnywYw5s6O/DB93h2jz4XU8KYZmZ<br />3+slR6o1wV/kDEKg/iFe0lIBdHmum3nEzfSN8kFqRAT/1sMyDBPPs7g7phNPe7lP<br />NACp4iUHdca8n419dDFDCoqJIXeM4gYqaj5njVvETt73car1l/p/h/GMKptK+CH/<br />nzlv<br />=tTJA<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />If you store this as a text file such as encrypted_msg.asc somewhere, and then open the terminal/command line and type this code:<br /><br />gpg -v encrypted_msg.asc<br /><br />The result is this information:<br /><br />gpg: public key is A9E19F6E<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID A9E19F6E<br /><br />A9E19F6E is the key ID for my public key. <br /><br />Of course, normally we do not encrypt messages using our own public keys. But there are possible negative consequences for anonymity due to this feature of PGP.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Many PGP or GPG software products (most Macintosh software appears to be setup this way for example) automatically encrypt a message to yourself as well as the other person you&#039;re sending the message to. So if anybody knows an association between you and your public key e.g. you uploaded it to a key server, or you use the same PGP key for both life inside and outside of SR, then if they intercept your message they&#039;ll know it is from you. They won&#039;t know what is inside the message, but they&#039;ll know it is you who sent it. Not good.<br /><br />The point is that you really want 1 PGP key for SR, and only SR. Never use that key anywhere else otherwise you&#039;ll be linkable between those two places.<br /><br />Note: One thing that can catch people out is signing. Unless you sign a public key locally, the signature will be uploaded to a keyserver automatically as part of a Web of Trust deal. This is pretty standard among most PGP/GPG software. So, if you are signing people&#039;s public keys, ensure you only do this locally. There is an option for this. Otherwise you can be hypothetically traced back from the keyserver. Yes, you could Torify your GPG client, but that&#039;s a whole other discussion.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Finally, consider that if a message is encrypted to somebody else&#039;s public key, that if the Feds know the source of the message, then they have evidence for a connection between you and that person. Sometimes that is all that is required.<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />hQGMA7pmVyGp4Z9uAQv9EvfKCl1k8lEDcfgQNR7t/iNg1RaGaQyEShmfgBFkFVWx<br />r4wjOTxo2Pl5I826Rhzv8axbSom/+K41WRRV38LiHT65RNrPQmyozV/vWOmo18eE<br />coXqdBzmuOIVbqUkd/oV0bgSxESmbSVc/cTmXDrniZZ/svcD+jbd+oSUCl8yp4U7<br />xor7ojdpAcL5QFPz8jy7sDU/+7fsDCsgoHW8OTPwcrPckqpFJUZFJd7/9qbbwdE6<br />BuyJYDmvFgqQAjB8qecYcpzUMzQzvYEbzMP1QHZ1XaAPIy2mB2FYXF44Am4JNgXY<br />sA7/FG27CPwd9RkxzPQrldMMgZuhs8x8/vVGxf7/tUusrQrSCMHnlRKE95vT5ffY<br />f2NsDvs24dOLZjCx2jfrr9W1MREUkja0wZPWaIjzhjAuKTaPWRQFWFVjOzacz3ca<br />6EYEzWFO09VRvb3RBBNIXJcJCM1HdfVcNtGSj7gspSlr1YWJSA1WuMmHzhy4KWNH<br />nfGUzY/8rAzinhT3AG9jhQEMA5jmn5iuBkvEAQf/b6ZunD7Sfwu+N2UEujF2WQGk<br />QsOfzAoy4bMSEt5l7bLLXzvjtsvCPWQIlbxQO2qZqUucGKH/rBwmakPtFoqNo03S<br />d/FCJts8Wtrxd5QNV8GhYSn3+fij6MHIkG2GjCSL344CAR/NQakQhEyvDPJNBUhH<br />Gmns7grYQXAWoG0ClIHrYIkFIH6L2pMvUBxfGXN2Hq2MiG735CLbKnT8aIUhIDib<br />/b4SFQ74LqV5L7E5g9P5e7iX/95Cro+SYCkAchpXtJlqtTscWBXWC426bW+3Q2rP<br />bPzLpageTiDiqGJJgWb8LzI2Zp3hKNbqLYm5vvSqfQAnh53K1Q0P6ZaDKPvKYtJL<br />AXidPBUIYvzDpC3N/8mdM4GRXOenVeXVGc9SBfxcyoYxis4syC9UcQ7Regl7m7Si<br />lpOVHOnHR1mPMwiZbJxas1WBQWqcTTb7UUA4<br />=D12u<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />The above message is encrypted to my public key and some random member of Club PGP.

Fortunately this is not the case.<br /><br />The point remains though, that this embedded Key ID business is an unhappy affair for us denizens of the Darknet. The next post shall address how to circumvent this inconvenience.<br />

WTF is a public key with an ID of 00000000? Anonymous, that is what. There is no way to prove that Pine encrypted that message. Of course I&#039;m telling you that I did so. But there is absolutely no evidence for it.<br /><br />How did I achieve this?<br /><br />There exists a configuration file in your PGP or GPG setup called gpg.conf or similar. If you don&#039;t know the location of this file on your computer, google &quot;gpg.conf&quot; and the name of your GPG or PGP distribution and you should find it. The location differs from operating system and PGP/GPG setup, so I won&#039;t describe where it generally hides out here.<br /><br />In any case, open it with a plaintext text editor like Notepad or Gedit and append this line to the file, then save it. <br /><br />hidden-encrypt-to &lt;YOUR GPG PUBLIC KEY ID HERE&gt;<br /><br />The result is twofold.<br /><br />1. All messages you now encrypt to others can be decrypted by yourself also e.g. in case you needed to add something and only remembered after you encrypted it, a common occurrence. Or to correct spelling. Whatever.<br /><br />2. There is no evidence your public key was used to encrypt the message.<br /><br />Highly useful I think.<br />

				Nice explanation, pine. You can also use throw-keyid to anonymize all recipients.<br /><br />Since you mentioned gpg.conf, here are some other options that make working with gpg easier, safer, or less annoying:<br /><br />trust-model always<br />utf8-strings<br />no-greeting<br />no-emit-version<br />no-comments<br />no-mdc-warning<br />armor<br /><br />

				There is one outstanding issue.<br /><br />In some situations, with very sensitive emails perhaps, you do not want &#039;AnonymousMan&#039; to be identified either. So in this situation a Fed coming across a message encrypted in this way would not be able to tell either the sender nor the receiver. Ideal! (but there is a caveat)<br /><br />Append this line to the gpg.conf file.<br /><br />throw-keyids<br /><br />The result when I encrypt to myself and AnonymousMan? <br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />hQEMAwAAAAAAAAAAAQgAlxsQMCvYXE9niDYUrdIonSomWxWcNBKEZ2Z/BoH3YF9M<br />lD2Kgs70evqVvUvMCFS4cwbW0lraT4lkNTChkNydyFK/xWkY23TqeoPBrkAV3mL5<br />teo1758jfRE0l77PSjP45dupQCWSR53IGlkIfxvauMCmIxIdDhBSshK/r+V2hGKz<br />85WJ79CGmbmCRWGs6MZ8/CAFJLkDEYj2N7z00Q84GIIc2wx4+J07Y1zchBLbCzYA<br />2ds3u47TbjyvvG7MWtHs5IZFfpNndtrWM/kOJAUUB7UX5WydPD3vVqIeRILflAyn<br />IAAEYvF9qKxD9DkWWgTE5lmUboC3bjv9MFSsuhOyPYUBjAMAAAAAAAAAAAEL/i8D<br />GIDvraq6+9OuwzXHBZ3CMNTwqd53Zyi9G+1pJhVAADJOY4IDoQRDkSRxVI5GDRoJ<br />F/8I/72C7F19Cmlnj/tLJPrhfqiYRmvfG5tl9a7NKLefhKo6D5/5XzlwHBFuEJ2V<br />8ZxyzrQgB24701pxAhDhN8V4lrBCVk4YyCnTIIDd7By5nu15kXzoyyOP+KEyBUCW<br />IDG9N4eZJEsgxP95pQqk1GLpyswkydHlWXZA12+FSF/tKjHumNiiEhv9mWOOphD7<br />6nGC/ZAI7uT5i6uJ4S9V531gc1xWlIPSaZkx3ogGXyhE5xPWLh4VbhEa6UL76KkV<br />PIpYQngiwmSNAziL5Pzd3IV0fxN5JoJt1T8VTwbIKCepqn/uR7EKVFZE8PEBfb+l<br />VIdr7jueJVaSxFwFq8WHV3QAVPSx7KBFUbaWSSlkbCU4kIRaqJQXKsRZU9/nIqfQ<br />PWhzzQjDY9FCbXWxv2OBwW3TOhDBjb7y3HBsKCga16pKueEyFfFtjKW1JF/nvNJB<br />AbuPpTjcitnSN63dIbvmDeUMr8qc+1zDXYb6gxVva/gNgIuPQDG9l7XRSchLpVHH<br />JmPhz4c/1buwGPSaQlB60C8=<br />=oyUv<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />for which gpg -v only gives us: <br /><br />gpg: public key is 00000000<br />gpg: public key is 00000000<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000<br /><br />Perfect! Anonymity all around.<br /><br />As I said, there is a caveat. It&#039;s that to decrypt the message, GPG or PGP will have to try every single private key in your keychain (or the recipient&#039;s keychain), which appears alarming at first due to a dozen or so password requests, and then just plain annoying. But that is a small inconvenience really, unless you have a lot of private keys on your keychain, which to be honest you shouldn&#039;t, I would recommend you keep your PGP SR key all by its lonesome and use an entirely different copy of GPG for work/other purposes. Having a portable copy of GPG for a memory stick is a good way to achieve that. Then fat finger errors are not possible, like encrypting with your SR public key as well as to your boss, with your PGP public key up on SR for all to see. <br /><br />Finally if you don&#039;t want to use the gpg.conf file (good for setting up long term, consistent, default options) I do believe you can use throw-keyids and hidden-encrypt-to statements as flags on the command line/terminal so they are invoked only for the encryption of specific messages.<br /><br />Long live the platypus and the association of aquatic mammals. Our enemies fear the tread of our furry paws and inquisitive noses. Oh yes.<br />

				What if LE is sitting in your neighborhoods central office monitoring your activity?<br /><br />They&#039;d see everything. Your PGP codes, every keystroke, becomes &quot;Exhibit A&quot; for evidence in your prosecution. <br /><br />Assuming you&#039;re doing something illegal, of course. <br /><br />It&#039;s like locking your front door. <br /><br />If they really want to get in.

				As long as you have a Tormail account used exclusively for illicit business and all traces of PGP tools, TorBrowser, Vidalia, etc. are well encrypted, disguised, and hidden then you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; And besides, I view the Bitcoins trail and messaging as ancillary evidence to an actual package.&nbsp; You won&#039;t get indicted because of a plaintext email discussing drugs, certainly not a PGP encrypted one signed with your public key.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get indicted because you have a kilo of coke on your doorstep.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is important that when you do get arrested (and everyone should be ready for it&nbsp; ;) ), everything is going in your favor.&nbsp; Having a clean record of activity on your computer is vital, so thanks for the info pine.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t aware that you could trace who encrypted a message.<br />

				Anonymizing the key IDs doesn&#039;t offer extra protection in some cases. For example, if you send a message to a vendor, or an email to someone on TorMail, anyone with access to the SR or TorMail servers knows who the recipient is, so there&#039;s no reason to hide the key IDs from them.<br /><br />However, I can think of cases where it is useful. A vendor may want to send an encrypted announcement to several customers, but he doesn&#039;t want them to know who the others are. That&#039;s as much for their protection as his. The recipients would only be able to deduce the number of other recipients, but they couldn&#039;t compare the key IDs to people in their key chain.<br /><br />Another example is if someone gains access to your computer, but not your TorMail account. Let&#039;s say you saved encrypted messages in a text file, as a back up. Then the attacker would only know how many messages you sent, but not who the recipients are.<br /><br />BTW, if you think you can only be charged for physical drugs in your possession, you should review the Farmers Market case. They were charged for a lot of shit that they talked about in their Hushmail accounts, and that was the only evidence of those crimes. An email counts as a confession.<br />

It will take less time if the message has been decrypted with fewer keys, or you have fewer private keys to test, or it hits a match sooner. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137510.msg938211#msg938211">Quote from: Oompaloompa on March 25, 2013, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is there a way to get 2 without 1?

It should be under &quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;. This is an address, you need it (without quotations) to find the file but since you&#039;re using OSX, you&#039;ll need extra steps to find the address bar. <br /><br />http://superuser.com/questions/174297/how-can-i-get-an-address-bar-in-finder<br /><br />Read that, find one of their solutions and then copy paste that line into your address bar and it should take you to the folder in which the gpg.conf file is located in.<br /><br />If you choose to navigate to the file through the GUI manually, then you&#039;ll need to turn on the Show Hidden Files option in Mac, wherever that is. The ~ character is whatever your home directory is e.g. if your account is called &quot;geezy&quot; then the &quot;geezy&quot; directory is the home directory.<br /><br />Macs are perfectly easy to use until you want to do something Steve Jobs himself didn&#039;t think of personally.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137510.msg935910#msg935910">Quote from: astor on March 25, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anonymizing the key IDs doesn&#039;t offer extra protection in some cases. For example, if you send a message to a vendor, or an email to someone on TorMail, anyone with access to the SR or TorMail servers knows who the recipient is, so there&#039;s no reason to hide the key IDs from them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, it very much depends on your use of this feature.<br /><br />To newbs: If I wrote down an encrypted message using throw-key-ids, put it into a letter and posted it to a friend with his address on the front of the envelope and mine on the back of it, then using throw-key-ids to prevent traffic analysis would be somewhat pointless. However, if I wrote a message using a one time account on SR, then you would successfully be able to communicate without revealing your (SR) identity to traffic analysis if LE hack the server. You&#039;d use a new account per instance of a two way chat communication. Although this sounds like work, it&#039;s probably worth the trouble for very important communications. That way only the compromise of the recipient can possibly leak information about the sender. You&#039;d have to mix up what algorithms and key lengths you were using as well for each new public key, since throw-key-ids doesn&#039;t get rid of that information (persistently using the same settings for each key would be a giveaway).<br /><br />The reason why I mention server hacking is important: nobody should assume that their messages will be &#039;hidden&#039; unless they are encrypted. If you were ordering a large amount from a vendor, you almost certainly should be using such methods as these. If a vendor doesn&#039;t &#039;get&#039; it, find one that does.<br /><br />Encryption can do more than merely hide your messages, if used properly it can also make it impossible to associate any identity with transmission importance within the network. That is the death knell for LE teams, there is then no earthly way to prioritize their pattern analysis algorithms beyond wild guesswork. They spend a great deal of time building a &quot;Who&#039;s Who&quot; of Darknet participants and they&#039;ll be infuriated if lots of people start adopting practices which remove PGP key ID information out of existence.<br /><br />Another good use of this feature is when using anonymous remailers (for the final message the sender receives). This is a network of email servers that serves to send anonymous email, a sort of pre-Tor anonymity project for email. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137510.msg936357#msg936357">Quote from: quinone on March 25, 2013, 06:19 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I thought I was a weirdo hyper paranoid hypocrit because i&#039;ve always kept my ONE AND ONLY key in one place and would alway&#039;s use another instance of GPG with my keychain (I keep it small, moreso actually to remember the really good vendor&#039;s i&#039;ve worked with).&nbsp; But you just put my mind at ease, now i&#039;m just a weirdo hyper paranoid ... human being, no more hypocrisy !<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s good to pay attention to your instincts, they are there for a reason.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137510.msg937552#msg937552">Quote from: NW Nugz on March 25, 2013, 07:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Seems to me we need to have privacy-enabled version of software we can get that is already set up with the changes suggested in the OPs as defaults rather than options.

APG (anonPG) or something. It could have a list of requirements like:<br /><br />1. The inability to communicate with keyservers. Or route all such traffic via Tor with explanatory warnings.<br />2. Puts public keys you haven&#039;t used into a password protected encrypted volume after 30 days of non-use.<br />3. Transparent way to encrypt anonymously for you, and another option for your recipient<br />4. No meta data within the PGP headers.<br />5. 8912 bit available as standard.<br />6. Open source for code inspection. (hence the difficulty of selling it)<br />7. Steganography options for embedding message into audio, video, images etc.<br />8. Ability to setup anonymous remailers with ease.<br />9. Self destruct feature.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you guys can think of lots of other things. Simply making it obvious what is what would lift a huge burden on the amount you have to know before you&#039;re doing what you want to be doing. Some of it sounds like heavy lifting like the steg and remailers, but actually most of this already exists in the form of open source projects, it&#039;s mostly a matter of building a clever GUI to let people access the power of such tools. I don&#039;t have the time for it, but it&#039;d make a great project for somebody.

				You can actually see that this is going on with PGP, even with the padding.<br /><br />If you encrypt to 3 people, copy paste the result into a plaintext file.<br /><br />Now encrypt individually to 3 people. Copy paste and append the results together into a different plaintext file.<br /><br />Now compare the lengths. Even though it is the same information, it is clear that the first plaintext file is much shorter than the second one.<br /><br />Compression can only account for so much since ciphertexts are intended to look as much as possible like random noise to prevent cryptanalysis. So now you know why :-)

				SSL/TLS session keys are negotiated with asymmetric cryptography, usually RSA or ECDH. You pretty much never use a symmetric algorithm for multi-party communications without also using a key exchange algorithm (or without sharing an original key face to face at least). Usually the only time you use symmetric algorithms alone is for&nbsp; encrypted data storage like FDE or Truecrypt containers.

I mean, most will put their username on their PGP key, to my knowledge, because it makes it easier for one with a large keyring to identify them (I believe you&#039;ve brought this up before as well). Plus, just based on the basic rules of SR, you don&#039;t associate anything you do here with your real life identity. Thank you, however, for going more into detail on this. It definitely bolsters our safety ideology here on SR.

				Hey Guys<br /><br />Pretty new to SR and trying to keep my security to a maximum! I have read pine&#039;s very informative post and have attempted to configure my Gpg4win program with hidden-encrypt-to as well as throw-keyid.<br /><br />After many attempts and many, many hours of attempting to configure, evidence that my key was used to encrypt the message is still evident in command prompt.&nbsp; I am obviously appending the lines to the configuration file incorrectly.. I am using gpg-conf.skel - should I add the lines in at the beginning of that file, the middle somewhere or at the end?<br /><br />Sorry if its a silly question - i&#039;m not a real computer wizz.

				One thing I noticed is that zeroing out the key ID breaks some (crappy) PGP programs. Rather than testing every available private key, they just fail to decrypt the PGP block. Keep that in mind. If you use it all the time, even when you don&#039;t have to, you may get complaints or people will think you don&#039;t know how to create a PGP message and they may ignore you for wasting their time.<br />

				If you encrypt with your own public key, and you have the private key available in your key ring, then it should test all of them and find the right one. Don&#039;t know what else to tell you, except make sure the private key is there and you&#039;re encrypting with the right public key.<br />

				Not sure what MDC is but I am going to go out on a limb and guess that it has to do with message authentication codes, in which case it should be left enabled. I don&#039;t know if some GPG programs don&#039;t use it or not, but if they don&#039;t it is a security flaw on their end. <br /><br />Okay just looked up MDC<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A modification detection code (MDC) is a message digest that can prove the integ-<br />rity of the message. A message authentication code (MAC) ensures the integrity of<br />the message and the data origin authentication. The difference between an MDC<br />and a MAC is that the second includes a secret between Alice and Bob.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So pretty much the MDC is to make sure that the ciphertext is not modified in such a way that the plaintext changes. All in all I don&#039;t think it is a huge threat but MDC detects it. <br /><br />It is probably something like hashing the plaintext message and then concatenating the hash to the plaintext prior to encryption, and during decryption removing the hash then hashing the plaintext and comparing the hash to the concatenated hash.
