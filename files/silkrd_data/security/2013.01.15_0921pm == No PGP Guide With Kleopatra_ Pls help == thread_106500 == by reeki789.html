				So the guides for PGP on here don&#039;t show them using the updated version of GPG4Win, mine is using kleopatra not GNU privacy assistant as shown in the guides<br /><br />Anyways i have entered my name email password and generated my certificate, now i&#039;m stuck on step 7 of this guide http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />I am trying to encrypt a message, it says to use the clipboard in the above guide.. there is no clipboard... there is no where i see to put in any of the information shown in the guide<br /><br />If someone could tell me WTF to do from this point in order to encrypt my message using KLEO. One of the vendors i want to deal with requires me to communicate using PGP. Or if there is a updated guide please let me know the link.<br /><br />THANKS<br /><br />

				There is no clipboard interface for Kleopatra - it only encrypts/decrypts messages that are saved as text files (very bad for security).<br /><br />The clipboard is in the GNU Privacy Assistant (GPA), which should also have been included in the Gpg4win installation. GPA is the one you need for encrypting/decrypting on a clipboard.<br /><br />A much simpler option is Gpg4USB (http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de). It also has a clipboard and has a much simpler design.<br />

				I was going to say exactly what SorryMario said. When you were installing you PGP program did you see a screen with a bunch of check mark boxes? Ther should have been an unchecked box with gpuPGP. Check that and use gpu to encrypt/decrypt.
