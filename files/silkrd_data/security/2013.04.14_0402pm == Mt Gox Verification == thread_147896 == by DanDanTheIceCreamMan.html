				Fuck yeah the process is slow.<br /><br />Deposited coins in there without knowing about the change.<br />Cant get any of my coins out of there without verification, so verification it is.<br />Expect to get them out in about 15 days or so, since its about ~1000 a day i think...

				Verification is needed to increase your account withdraw/transfer limits and to withdraw any amount of money to a bank account. <br /><br />See details :<br />https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20919111-AML-Account-Statuses

As long as I don&#039;t withdraw over 100 coins a day, which I never will, then I am good. I usually only get a few hundred dollars worth of coins at a time so the level -0 status is fine for my SR needs.

				I guess the good thing with MtGox is, because of 80% of BTC traded on there is that they will execute faster than other smaller exchanges. I could have saved nearly $1000 (at least $500) when the BTC was going down, also since I was so bullish (whoa boy!) even though I should have had money in my account a DAY (15-17 hrs. actually) I would have been able to buy at $177 instead of having to wait until the following morning to buy at $211. For a while there, I thought that I was pretty smart (pretty lucky to have some money that had finally been paid for work performed 2 years earlier) I put $3000 in and my BTC were worth about slightly over $8000. I thouight I was really lucky. Then it started downhill (clearly manipulated and would have been totally illegal in almost anything else but BTC or other digital currency) and I couldn&#039;t sell. I watched the price drop from $260 to $200 to 180 to $160 and I was trying to sell. Couldn&#039;t get any answer from BitFloor. So I watched my money go down at one point to about 50-60 each bitcoin and then it jumped&nbsp; up to about $170-180 and I probably could have sold then. I could see the selling, and it seemed to have resistance at around that price. So the next day my computer was down, and I spent the day fixing it. Day after that it&#039;s about $100, and I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s only going to go up from there. Today I can see it hasn&#039;t hit it&#039;s bottom yet. Of course the whole manipulation could be done all over again, that&#039;s probably why the buying (which started the price climbing) won&#039;t start to any extent. Today I finally sold at $75. I lost about $1000. I guess I was an idiot, not knowing what I was doing and not even thinking about possible manipulation. I think that this is going to hurt BTC until there is some defense against DDOS attacks (which greatly accellerated t he panic) MtGox just said a week or so ago that it was vunerable to DDOS attacks. Financial responsibility should have MADE them take the best practices against these DDOS attacks (although I&#039;m not a tech guy, and don&#039;t know if it could be done-but I heard that SR and TOR can&#039;t be disturbed by DDOS?) I&#039;m pretty cynical about the whole thing. Sorta like you do the crime, you do&nbsp; the time, and I didn&#039;t know shit about this type of thing. $1000 isn&#039;t all that much, I can make myself feel a lot better just by looking at people at the freeway offramps with coffee cans and signs asking for money (and always &#039;God Bless&#039;)<br />Like I said I&#039;m not a tech guy (other than fooling around with my computer and (old) auto and motorcycle repair, but it seems that BTC hasn&#039;t hit it&#039;s bottom. And I&#039;m not anxious to buy in again, the DDOS attacks could happen again. SOMEBODY made some serious money, maybe millions, and a LOT of people took a HAIRCUT. <br />And I guess the way my long comment ties in with MtGox is that it is probably better at executing trades, since 80% of BTC is done there. I cynically think they could have had some protection, and suspect that maybe somebody there probably made some money. I really dislike dealing with companies that are so eager to gain legitimacy in governments eyes (US in&nbsp; this case) that they could care less what concessions they make that keeps them in the money. Maybe it&#039;s just my &#039;jaundiced&#039; eyes. But maybe I could have saved money if my money was at MtGox instead of BitFloor (which performed great for me until the day that they got &#039;busy&#039;)
