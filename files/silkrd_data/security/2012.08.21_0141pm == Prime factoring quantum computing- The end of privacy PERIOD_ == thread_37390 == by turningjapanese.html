				This is on naturalnews.co. Now, There is no source for&nbsp; this info, but of course I believe it ^.^ Said to be completed &quot;in a few years&quot;<br /><br />I would like to cpoy/paste the link (or better yet the words?) But I never got an answer in my previous thread: Is it safe to copy/paste and/or upload pics from your own comp to SR?

				Yes it is safe as can be to post links, uploading pics requires that you remove metadata and even then it isn&#039;t suggested but should be fairly safe particularly it is safe if you did not take the picture yourself. <br /><br />The person who wrote that article does not understand quantum computing, although it is true that it can pwn many forms of modern encryption if it ever gets advanced enough anyway. There are already quantum immune public key algorithms though, so it is hardly the end of privacy PERIOD...just the end of discrete logarithm and prime factorization based public key encryption.

				Good luck maintaining a state of decoherence in a multi-qubit logic circuit.&nbsp; Granted IBM has established a 7 qubit array that doesn&#039;t break decoherence, each additional quibit makes it exponentially harder to maintain quantum superposition.<br /><br />This is only describing the logic circuit itself, research on input, output and a number of other technologies required for a functional machine is pretty much only just beginning.<br /><br />Fuck Schr√∂dinger and his dead and alive cat :P :P

				Wow, If you are going to post, please do not use Natural News as a source for computational advancements.&nbsp; Next of all, I find your opinion on vaccines absolutely uneducated and misinformed.&nbsp; You obviously have not had family members INJURED by vaccines.&nbsp; You state whooping cough outbreak? Down here in the USA the only people who got whooping cough were vaccinated against it.&nbsp; The vaccine has a 50/50 chance of working anyways, its not exactly what I&#039;d call safe.&nbsp; I do not vaccinate my children and they have never been sick, and they will never get sick, because their immune systems aren&#039;t being ruined by toxins and chemicals inside of vaccines.

				I&#039;ve seen the site before. While I like some of the info and have a serious interest in holistic methods, the delivery system of the site is a bit over the top. I will say that I think vaccines are fucked in many many instances. Definitely do NOT want any kind of argument here since I see this as a very hot topic. I&#039;ve seen enough to know what I would do. When it comes to big pharma, vaccine companies, CONVENTIONAL medicine is mostly for profit. I do not trust the institutions and facilities promoting vaccines. I see the need for MOST vaccines as propaganda. Not altogether of course. Conventional modern medicine absolutely has it&#039;s place. But swine flu, HIV and AIDS and endless cases of dis info that&#039;s been going on for a long time, I don&#039;t trust the institution. What about sars? Anyone south park fans? Great episode on sars. There&#039;s toxic mercury and who knows what else in vaccines. The debate can go on for ages though. But I do think it&#039;s criminal the drugs pumped into the public. Especially children. Try raising your kids on actual foods. Not doritos, taco bell, and fried chicken. There&#039;s REAL reasons people are against vaccines. Real cases. Vaccines are part of the status quo. I see those who support vaccines and most conventional medical practices as also conventional in lifestyle. Our lifestyle, toxic planet, food, poisons everywhere are a much bigger threat than not taking vaccines IMO. And autism I definitely believe comes from them. <br /><br />Dig you gu! But we&#039;ll have to have opposing viewpoints. I thought actually when you were talking about people doing what to their own bodies, I thought you were going to be FOR them taking vaccines if they want haha. Bless us all!

First with Guru&#039;s comment on mandatory vaccines. They tried that with the HPV vaccine locally and found all kinds of side effects and problems. To the point that the state dropped the requirement. So in may ways I support peoples decisions on what vaccines their kids get.<br /><br />However, thereisnospoon... Not sure I agree with you. Recently there has been a local outbreak of measles and whopping cough. Because the parents did not vaccinate there kids. The problem here is that the vaccines ware off and adults are catching it from the kids.<br /><br />I personally believe that we are over vaccinated in many cases. The length that the vaccine lasts is note well studied so they push to get vaccinated more than one should. A good example of this is the tetanus vaccine. For as long as I remember it has been every 3 years you needed to get a booster, or maybe it was 5 years. Now they are saying you need a booster every 12 years.<br /><br /><br />

				Though it might not be the best source, at least it has empirical research as well as historical research, I suggest &quot;the panic virus&quot; by Seth M. buy it and read it. The problem with America is most people are too stupid to realize how stupid they are. Without giving away my profession I can easily say vaccines save lives.

				I would say, we are a set of states that are not healthy. We eat gmo, processed, pesticidal, larvicidal, herbicidal, and chemicals galore in all most foods and all restaurants except a choice few are full of the same sourced factory farmed crap. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying this means we don&#039;t need vaccines, but at all the fuckin convenience and super market stores parading the shingles vaccines and whatever else... i mean come on, if you know anything, you know the flu vaccines are pure bullshit. there&#039;s tons of flus and the vaccines barely do anything. we are indoctrinated, undereducated, demineralized, and domesticated. <br /><br />You put the blessed children on living organic foods and build the immune system like it should be built, and most of the vaccines become unnecessary. just like most of the big pharma drugs, most of the doctors orders, and most all else of the detriment absolutely NEEDED and DEPENDED on for the medical Industries to survive. it&#039;s not personal. it&#039;s just business. <br /><br />if you are one to only trust your doctor.... you probably disagree here.
