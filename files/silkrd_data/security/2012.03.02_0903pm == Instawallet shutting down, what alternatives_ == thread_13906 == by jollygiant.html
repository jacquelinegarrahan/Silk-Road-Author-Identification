				After a few minutes of frustration and loathing, running to instawallet to remove the couple btc spread between accts, I decided to figure out an alternative to use as my anonymous proxy between the exchange and Road.<br /><br />I never figured out the btc client since I basically just buy coins and then straight to the road to be spent. <br /><br />For online longer term secure storage, I have used strongcoin but every withdrawal incurs a one percent fee and btc are already expensive enough.<br /><br />I found a site called (https) btcbuckets.com which looks almost like an exact copy of instawallet except with a few additional feature. It just went live on the 12th of Feb and I have not sent any coins through it yet, so I would definitely do a test run with a coin and make sure you can withdraw properly from the site... <br /><br />Good luck,<br />- miR

				Came here looking for this thread, was not disappointed. Then I saw no one had given any alternative (except for running your own wallet and one site which was newly opened). So I&#039;m wondering. Is it fine sending to bitfog directly from the exchange or is it somehow traceable as &quot;being sent to bitfog&quot; which, obviously, could point to something fishy going on?<br /><br />Edit: Also, BtcBuckets requires javascript to be enabled to be able to click the send-link, which I&#039;m not comfortable with.

				Anybody who uses the buckets should realize that they expire as well (maybe only TWO days as default, check for sure), so you need to set them up appropriately and it also has a .0005 btc fee per transaction<br /><br />Oh, yea I definitely wasnt saying that instawallet was a tumbler, but they do pool the bitcoins and then pull them out of the pool at least. <br /><br />How long does bitcoin fog take? The 1 - 3 percent fee is a bummer though, are there any cheaper mixers that anyone knows of?

				Well there&#039;s always the choice of creating an account under a fake name on an exchange that&#039;s accessible via Tor.&nbsp; So you could go to someplace like Intersango, which I think is still accessible from Tor, create an account, and send your &#039;coins there before you send &#039;em to SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a thought, but it might work if the exchange doesn&#039;t charge a percentage to get or send Bitcoins.&nbsp;

				So in the past (as i&#039;d imagine a lot of us have) i&#039;ve run getbitcoin &gt; instawallet x10 &gt;SR. Say i needed to make a BTC purchase right now (no time or money for a tumbler) and i bank deposited with getbitcoin. Would it be unwise to then have the btc sent directly to SR? With bank deposits, isn&#039;t it only traceable back to you if they go to the bank for the surveillance footage? Which I wouldn&#039;t think would be very likely or worthwhile in my estimation for however many thousands of small time buyers. Apparently instawallet doesn&#039;t make you anonymous whatsoever anyway!<br /><br />Are the viable alternatives at the moment, aside from the bank deposit &gt; SR , to just use btcbucket or does anyone have a dissuading argument against both options?<br />Hopefully we get some feedback and figure out a btc pool we can trust, but goddamn.. right now i&#039;m at a loss for how to approach this. <br /><br />Would it be better to just use a SR btc vendor?? haha I never thought I&#039;d say that..<br /><br />Edit: for the record, i&#039;m weary of directly installing the BTC application on my PC as it&#039;s not usable with liberte or tails and based on my experience it leaves quite the trail on one&#039;s PC (time, bandwidth and space)<br />

				I have come up with a few more alternatives to instawallet. Each of these are eWallets, and my goal was to find wallets (which I think are accessible through, though I have only checked a few with actual accts!) without fees (or very small) for depositing and withdrawing btcs. Not sure if they are pooled but many are I think as well. <br /><br />*I am not a security expert, probably the opposite compared to some, so this is not saying any of these are safe*<br /><br />*Please do your your own tests with a small amount of btc to ensure all of these function properly. I have not sent btc through any of these yet*<br /><br />The first I mentioned was btcbuckets.com which is similar to instawallet with more features but a .0005 btc w/d fee. the buckets also expire, after which no new funds can be depsited, and current fund get spilled to another address. default two days and their pocketbook??? can be edited for up to a year and your own address i assume. someone mentioned javascript was required to send possibly. instant free transfers between buckets i think<br /><br />There are two exchanges, one called Camp BX and the other crypto x change. I am not sure if these wallets work through tor but there are no fees for btc tranfers <br /><br />there is a betting site called btcsportsbet.com that has a wallet, registering acct doesnt require the email address to be entered, and no transfer fees<br /><br />another similar site is for tipping called youtipit has a wallet with no fees <br /><br />the group responsible for intersango has a free ewallet at vibanko.com but someone reported intersango (or someone associated?) are outspokenly protesting the Road<br /><br />strong coin is probably the most secure cause you can even take your own coins out via a dat file and is double password protected. however, this service does not pool your coins therefore I dont believe, and they also charge a 1 % fee on withdrawal<br /><br />Finally there is flexcoin, which claims to be the first btc bank. transfers between accts are free and instant I believe but withdrawals cost .01 btc or .5 %&nbsp; whichever is more, however there is something like interest on the accts where the fees are partially paid back or something... i didnt really read into it and they also require and email to verify possibly<br /><br />If anyone has any other recommendations or experience with any of these wallets please post! Thank you. Good luck<br />- microRiboNucleicAcid

				btcsportsbet also presumably needs javascript to enter a receiving address as it won&#039;t let you push the button to add one w/ js off.<br /><br />is it such a bad idea to go bank deposit &gt; get-btc&gt; SR address? <br /><br />As i mentioned, it doesn&#039;t sound like instawallet was much of an annonymous tool anyway.<br /><br />would bank deposit&gt; bitinstant &gt; mtgox &gt; SR be any safer anyway?

				Using the bitcoin client through tor or an online wallet further obfuscates the path the coins traveled, offering more deniability than if there is a straight line from your bank to SR, you have a bigger problem.

				What about using a Blockchain.info wallet? I set one up using my tormail account, and can access it through TOR. They have an optional fee of .0005 BTC. Whould it be feasible to set up a couple accounts through them to tumble your coins?<br /><br />This is the message you get about the fee when sending coins:<br /><br />&quot;This transaction is low priority. It is recommended you include at least a 0.0005 BTC transaction fee in order to ensure miners process it. If you do not include any fee this transaction may take a long time to get included in a block. &quot;

				The Instawallet&#039;s greatest feature was ability to obfuscate the transactions in blockchain. You deposit coins, the coins are withdrawn by another user, you withdraw someones else coins or combination of them. Using Bitcoin software on your computer with or without Tor is no difference, the transactions on blockexplorer will be the same. And Yes, I was using instawallet exclusively trough Tor.<br /><br />Hope instawallet owner succeeds in selling it and new owners are as pro-liberty as he was.

				I was actually asking if transfers between two accounts both BE wallets were instant, as instawallet was... this is an indication the bitcoins come from a communal pool for the site rather than individually maintained wallets and no shared coins. <br /><br />audacity, vibanko works fine through tor without javascript for the entire registration process, its the only one i checked myself that would work. <br /><br />didnt check for pooling though for vibanko cause i was in a rush for lexis new product... cant fucking wait for these two new dank kush strains. <br /><br />still havent checked flexcoin but someone else reported it worked. i think transfers between flexcoin accts are instant which may mean it pools the coins and provides increased obfuscation of the path there is a small fee however for each withdrawal to SR<br /><br />good luck everyone!<br />- miR

				That is some awesome news... i am still kinda skeptical though at first, will check again to make sure its working properly. and wish I hadnt wasted so much time finding an alternative :)&nbsp; Oh well, instawallet wont load for me now and the more convoluted the path the better imo<br /><br />Zerobin you can also use vibanko.com, it has been confirmed to work although i do not think the coins are pooled as with instawallet
