				Alright, not sure if I need to go full blown killswitch on this one, but my firewall just started going nuts. 1800+ Intrusions blocked, so far. Probably another ten in the time it took me to type this. All coming from (Program Files (x86)\HP\Digital Imaging\bin\hpqtra08.exe) Can&#039;t delete. Cant run it in the sandbox. Cant even fucking open it. Tried using Sure Delete, no luck. So, what should I be doing now?&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />.25bitcoin to whomever helps me solve this. Just because I&#039;m a nice guy and need some help. :P

				The easiest way is to simply download ubuntu and burn it to a cd or dvd.<br /><br />Boot up with it and click try installation. Then open your folders and browse to (Program Files (x86)\HP\Digital Imaging\bin\hpqtra08.exe) and you should be able to delete it.

				Can you end the process in windows task manager (CTRL-ALT-DEL)?&nbsp; Also, according to their site:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If there are any problems with hpqtra08.exe, you can also uninstall the program using the Control Panel ⇒ Add/Remove programs ⇒ HP Photo &amp; Imaging or HP Image Zone</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Seems like a lot of people have had problems with this process, so it may just be a software bug, rather than an intrusion attempt.<br /><br />Still, consider running Tails from a USB stick if you want a more secure experience.

				Many thanks for the coins, much appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Tails is a bootable USB mounted OS that is preconfigured for anonymity.&nbsp; It has tor, pgp and tons of other stuff.&nbsp; You set your computer to boot into USB from the bios, bypassing your hard disk and windows completely.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty slick.<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/
