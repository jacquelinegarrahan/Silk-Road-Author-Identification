				I see google is actually caching SR?<br /><br />Haha, wow. I&#039;m not sure whether that&#039;s good news or bad news.<br /><br />Halp! We&#039;re naked! Come back darknet!<br /><br />I have a feeling Google will be forced to drop this functionality for the Tor2Web project. For one thing this must surely mean there&#039;s a whole bunch of links to illegal porn on the clearnet, in fact, I&#039;m not going to check, but they may be caching more than just links as well. Is openness of this sort cool? Well... I guess it depends. I mean what we&#039;re doing on this forum is free speech in the same way bluelight and other other clearnet drug forums are, the actual illegal transactions are occurring over at SR itself. Whether or not the LEA will see it that way is another thing. It is an interesting problem for a lawyer.

				onion.to is a proxy<br />SR is hosted on a .onion domain<br />the Google spider bot does not crawl to .onion sites...it&#039;d need to relay thru the proxy to reach SR and the bot is not designed to do that...<br /><br />did you read the onion.to disclaimer?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Disclaimer<br /><br />We are not hosting the website you have requested!

				but it is possible that this onion.to proxy would be a threat to the SR community...it allows individuals to access SR directly with a clearnet browser without any anonymity relays...is there anyway DPR and the admins can block the IP of this proxy?
