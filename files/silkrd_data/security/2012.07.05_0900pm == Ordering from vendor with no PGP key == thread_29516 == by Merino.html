				My devil may care side thinks sending my info in cleartext via SR is highly unlikely to be a problem. On the other hand I don&#039;t understand why the hell a vendor wouldn&#039;t have a key on his page. Any techies care to break down the risk or lack of risk? I doubt I&#039;ll do it but am curious about the technical aspects.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The vendor should definitely be using encryption. If you can, find a vendor that does use PGP. I&#039;d be concerned that if a vendor doesn&#039;t care enough about their own security, why would they care about yours. <br /><br />Anyway, the information entered into the address box is automatically encrypted. Additional encryption is technically optional, but highly recommended, for everyone&#039;s security.<br /><br />sdesu

Cleartext that stays within the TOR network is already pretty strongly encrypted.<br /><br />However the GPG is a nice extra layer, I would recommend it if you send your address to somebody. If there does turn out to be some kind of leak in the network, then at least that info is not out in the open. <br /><br />GPG isn&#039;t the easiest piece of software to learn, but it isn&#039;t that hard either. A professional seller should know how to use it.

				It all worked out. Vendor was new and had just neglected to put his key on his vendor page.
