				Hi guys, I&#039;m looking at trying this same route to get my Bitcoins in my wallet. It seems from what Kakster says it might be best using the SEPA option for depositing funds rather than the international bank option as the international bank option has a minimum $15 charge on any of these transactions whereas SEPA is free. I could be wrong here but I think that&#039;s the case. Kakster how did you actually get the cash into the Slovenian account? Did you do it with an online bank transfer or can you do it with cash into some bank on the street?

				I very stupidly (don&#039;t need to repeat that) deposited £300 to Mt.gox in a hurry. From what I read on different forums, they are pretty fucked up atm. I used a GBP bank wire to Japan, does anyone know if I will ever be credited or even see my money again? As you can probably understand this is stressing me out big time.

				If it was wired to their japanese branch, you should be ok. It&#039;ll just take a few more days.<br />The current furrore with mtgox is that you can no longer transfer or deposit cash into their uk Barclays account.

I&#039;ve not found any legit looking site that&#039;ll directly exchange UKash for BTC, you need to go through some other electronic payment system like cashu or okpay:<br />cashu charges 10% commission &amp; looks to convert to USD, I&#039;m told they also require ID for verification<br />okpay is 1% commission but they&#039;ve stopped accepting UKash due to technical issues, they may accept it again in a few weeks but who knows. No need for verification if your dealing with under 3ooEuros a month.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t seen any other sites that look like they can do the job.

				mercaBit.eu for UKASH is good, though I noticed he&#039;s just put up his commission to 11.5%<br /><br />He&#039;s cool though, worth asking if he has the bitcoins as had to wait a few days for him to get his stash back up but he is totally legit and also anonymous.

				It is bizarre that a bunch of people who want to save money and obtain bitcoins with the least amount of trouble, won&#039;t invest a tiny amount of time in working out how OTC or over the counter bitcoin works. Less risk, more money, less arbitrary rules, more anonymity, faster access to bitcoins. These are typical improvements. Using exchanges only seems straight forward, but this is an illusion as many of you have been finding out with frozen accounts, stalled payments, hidden fees, not necessarily to do with the exchange but with your bank etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not seeing very many downsides here. There are downsides (danger of scammers mostly) but these are marginal in comparison to the benefits, esp. if you invest time in a little research on your chosen OTCV.<br /><br />Learn this or go home. Seriously. Bitcoin will be illegal soon, and then this will be the only option.<br /><br />I shall spam the acronym OTC until I&#039;m as ubiquitous as the forum&#039;s spammer :)<br /><br />You do not need to be a &quot;tech person&quot; to grasp OTC.<br /><br />/complaint<br /><br />Read this: http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1829/how-does-one-use-bitcoin-otc<br /><br />Google the following:<br /><br />http://www.bitcoin-otc.com<br />http://www.tradebitcoin.com<br />https://localbitcoins.com<br />http://btcnearme.com<br />https://btcspot.com<br /><br />There are others, those are just the ones I know of.<br /><br />And all these IRCs:<br /><br />Server&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Channel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description<br /><br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-otc-eu&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #bitcoin-otc-eu &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European OTC trading marketplace.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-otc-uk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #bitcoin-otc-uk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United kingdom OTC Trading Marketplace.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-otc-ru&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-otc-ru &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russian OTC trading marketplace.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/btc.chat&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#btc.chat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Russian bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-aus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #bitcoin-aus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aussie bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-br&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-br &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazilian bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-cad&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-cad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Canadian bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-cn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-cn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chinese bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-de&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-de &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; German bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-il&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-il &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Israeli bitcoin community.<br />irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-dk&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#bitcoin-dk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Danish bitcoin community. <br /><br />Again, there are many many others out there.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure somebody is out there who will relieve you of your USD/AUD/GBP/EUR in exchange for bitcoins.<br /><br />

				Okay I just made my 1st successful transaction using Bitcoin-OTC.<br /><br />After a fair bit of reading and patience it all went smoothly. You just need to do your research and be cautious of scammers (at least 3 tried contacting me) .<br /><br />I managed to get them via bank transfer at a rate of 2% above the MtGox weighted average, which at the time was equal to 7.60 GBP per BTC :)<br />From funds sent to receiving them in my account was just under 90 minutes.<br /><br />I highly recommend UK users give this method a try but cannot stress enough to get to grips with how everything works 1st and use caution. There are some helpful sellers on there if you need help.

				The best advice I can give is to familiarize yourself with the rating system and &#039;Web of Trust&#039;. Work your way through the wiki: http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Main_Page<br /><br />Authenticating yourself and only dealing with other authenticated users is key! http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/GPG_authentication<br /><br />The rating system is fairly straight forward: http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/OTC_Rating_System<br /><br /><br />Best of luck to all you fellow UK crypto-anarchists ;D

				^ I&#039;m delighted to hear I&#039;ve made some converts! :)<br /><br />The more the merrier. The more you use OTC, the more obvious it becomes this is going to be the only way forward ultimately. It is much akin to learning PGP. Once you have it, you have it and it is easy. It only appears to be formidable, but it&#039;s not.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys! You&#039;re giving our benighted LE observers heartburn :)

				I used localbitcoins.com to get my coins, I found a trusted seller with decent priced coins (£7.50 each), messaged him, he sent me his bank details, I made the transfer, he released the coins, the whole thing took about five minutes, highly recommended aslong as you use a seller with good feedback

The process makes mtgox look like a walk in the park, but is essentially this assuming you&#039;re doing a bank wire transfer:<br /><br />If you youtube &quot;bitcoin otc&quot; a video (with shitty quality) will completely explain steps 1-3 for you in full. The resolution is terrible, but the tutorial will suffice. If you don&#039;t watch that video you will have no idea what I&#039;m talking about in steps 1-3.<br /><br />1. Download gpg4win and create a key <br /><br />2. Open up the IRC chatroom bitcoin-otc. This can be done in a browser, and does not require a client. The link is somewhere in the wiki, I&#039;ll try and remember to edit my post and paste it here later.<br /><br />3. Link your PGP key to your chat nickname. The way this is done is:<br /><br />a) A bot will generate a PGP message for you to decrypt using your key. You send that back to the bot, and your chat nickname will be linked to your PGP key.<br /><br />b) Everytime you relog on you will need to reauthenticate, via decrypting another PGP message.<br /><br />4. Post in the main room &quot;Looking for 20BTC etc - msg me with offers&quot;. Hopefully someone will PM you back with an offer, or they&#039;ll post in the main chat room. Make sure you get decent rates too, some sellers WILL try and take newcomers to town.<br /><br />5. Check sellers rating by typing &quot;;;getrating &lt;seller&#039;s nickname&gt;&quot; to see if they&#039;re legit.<br /><br />6. PM seller them for more information. Explain that this is your first time etc and they&#039;ll hopefully be understanding. I would advise buying 1 at first, rather than staking 100 odd quid on some randomer on some random service first time.<br /><br />7. They will ask for your wallet address, use a blockchain.info one not a SR one. Make an account there and you will be assigned an address automatically.<br /><br />8. They will give you their sort code and acc no. and full name. Make a payment online. They will probably ask for a print screen of the confirmation via email.<br /><br />9. They will deposit the BTC in your blockchain wallet.<br /><br />I<br /><br />Thats about it really. Its not the easiest transition in the world but the adv are:<br /><br />* Its near instantaneous<br />* Excellent rates if you look hard enough, saving you a little money<br />* Its more anonymous, especially if your arrange to meet in public.<br /><br />Even if mtgox/intersango returned, I would get BTC from here in the future.<br /><br />I will do a full explanation when I get around to it. <br /><br />Hopefully this list helps enough people to at least understand what the hell it is, or better get hold of some BTC.<br />Good luck.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks so much for all your advice Pine - you really are a &#039;hero member&#039;. I had forgotten about OTC, then wrote it off &#039;cos bank transfers aren&#039;t great for anonymity, but of course you&#039;re absolutely right, cash deposits are an anonymous way of doing the same thing.<br /><br />It&#039;s so nice to be using a proper sensible p2p method to get bitcoins, rather than relying on sleek pseudo banks and all the crap they try to put you through.

				Thanks for the tutorial and the contributions.&nbsp; I agree Cash is King, however the only confirmation for the BTC seller is when the money hits his account.&nbsp; Only then will he release your coins to you right? I understand there are reputable vendors but what happens when their reputation soars assuming this takes off? Wish there was an escrow system that could be implemented to incentivise the transfer of your coins.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing having their real details will act as enough of a deterrent

				Yeah that is pretty much the only means of confirmation. As BTC-OTC is decentralised, there is no built-in escrow system. <br /><br />It is possible to use a 3rd party escrow, but honestly if a seller is authenticated, has been rated 100+ times positively then I think you&#039;re good (Via the web of trust/linking a chatname to a PGP key).<br /><br />You also have their full name, bank account number etc, e-mail address. Just make sure you get someone helpful, with great ratings and you will be absolutely fine. I recommend everyone to sack off making international bank deposits and use bitcoin-otc, localbitcoins or similar, its so much quicker and convenient and you don&#039;t get fucked up the arse by exchange fees, bank fees etc, you can barter to get better rates, its 100x quicker, you don&#039;t have to rely on just one site etc. <br /><br />Yes there is a small chance of scamming but why would someone with great ratings selling each day scam you?&nbsp; Its not impossible, but unlikely.&nbsp;

				I think the 0.5% from OKPAY, max 2.99 is reasonable to get cash onto MTGox.&nbsp; At least then you can have the balance in hard currency on the main BTC exchange, when you need it rather than have it in BTC which are just too volatile for my liking. The combination of lack of trust and volatility is a two pronged fork I&#039;m unhappy with.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a pain in the arse to get a verified account on OKPAY to do a bank transfer and I am still waiting for confirmation.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is the newer pan European interbank system and uses the IBAN code with the BIC code.&nbsp; This is all that is needed.&nbsp; Its the same as any other interbank transfer but you just need to know those two codes to identify the recipient of the money.&nbsp; Charges are usually around 10 quid a pop to make the transfer.

				I&#039;ve gone through the OKPAY route and its a bit too much like hard work, currently I think the best bet is to just take the 10 quid hit of the international transfer to MTGox,&nbsp; <br /><br />OKPAY route is tough AML, then it takes a while to for them to credit the cash for a 4 quid fee. Then you have to pay MTGox in USD which they don&#039;t mention which of course incurs a transaction fee and then the 1% fee to MTGox.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think I&#039;ve lost just short of 7 quid and I&#039;m still waiting for MTGox to credit me with the money.<br /><br />Bank transfer to the Polish account will be more expensive but far simpler in the end.&nbsp; Just have to swallow the fee and move on IMO.

				When I first had a look at Bitcoin OTC and read about here - I thought hmmm&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; But after looking on almost all of the bitcoin sites and the hassle it is to do any sort of transfer I must admit OTC is definitely the way to go.<br /><br />First time on it last night and found a seller (UK bank transfer) almost immediately!!! Checked rating and was good to go ... luckily we were same bank so had BC within a few minutes.<br /><br />Please try it guys!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Thanks to J3an too - good info there&nbsp; ;)

Better for him, better for you. Win-win situation.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need any ID to make a cash deposit in the vast majority of jurisdictions. To do it anonymously.<br /><br />1. Do it at a bank branch you don&#039;t frequent normally.<br />2. Don&#039;t worry about CCTV. I know their systems, they are effectively worthless as far as facial recognition is concerned. If you are perturbed, wear sunglasses or a hat.<br />3. If your teller is nosy,&nbsp; give them nothing. They have no requirements. If you&#039;re being suspicious and they&#039;re asking questions you simply move to the next bank branch.<br /><br />If you are moving large quantities of capital in cash, you need the uniform. i.e. a decent suit, an expensive watch, perfume, the works. Perception of privilege drops the teller&#039;s guard to below zero. Most bank tellers are females, and females are exquisitely sensitive to the threat of embarrassment, a social faux pas.<br /><br />You however are simply a regular customer with several hundred bucks at a go, there&#039;s no requirement to go to such lengths.<br /><br />It is not, you know, illegal to give people money. Banks are in the business of accepting monies and preventing them from leaving if possible. They will fight tooth, nail and claw to ensure it. Cash deposits will be untouchable ID-wise for this reason. Any financial enterprise that kowtows to the State&#039;s machinations too closely goes bankrupt, everybody knows this. The black market is responsible for the majority of liquidity in the capitalist system. Financial institutions that don&#039;t grasp this go to the wall or lose market share all the time. Market forces!

Yes, the last thing you should do is transfer via online banking. Use a cash deposit at a branch (the bank of your BTC supplier).<br />2. No. Let&#039;s say your supplier has a BOA account. Then you deposit the money at any BOA branch into his account with cash. You do not require ID for this. You may even transfer a cash deposit from any bank in the world to that particular account, but fees would be involved for that, and it could be quite expensive and require a signature.<br /><br />

				In public is ideal when using LocalBitcoins.com<br /><br />Remember there is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoins! No need to worry about CCTV or anything.

				Oh dear daka123 you really need to read up about these things - plenty posts on the forums. Read Read Read.<br />For obvious reasons DO NOT buy BC with a C/C nor PayPal. Best figure out to get them from BITCOIN OTC as Pine suggested - if you&#039;re PC savvy as you say you are you&#039;ll manage to work it out ;). That is IRC, NickServ, Gribble, PGP, WoT etc<br />I&#039;ve managed just recently to do this and made a couple of successful transactions - quick and easy. It&#039;s well worth taking the time ...<br /><br />Here are some links to help:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=62808.0 - a second edition thread by je3n<br />http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Main_Page - links to what you need to do to access BITCOIN OTC<br /><br />Good luck&nbsp; ;)

				Would it be the most cost effective method, to buy UKash vouchers online, transfer them to OKPay, and then have them transfered into MtGox? From my research this seems to be the quickest possible method to at the best possible price.<br /><br />edit: no i am very high and this is not the quickest or easiest way.<br /><br />Does anyone have the best possible way? is it OTC like ru5ty has suggested above?

				I&#039;m looking to do a bank transfer to get some bitcoins, <br />I don&#039;t know which has the best rates, Intersango said that if you use Tor, they&#039;ll suspend your account and you&#039;ll need to submit AML documents or something..<br />I dont usually purchase through TOR anyway, just use the anonymous 1.5% mixer fee at Blockchain.info<br /><br />I&#039;ve reached my limit with Barclays PingIt but was wondering if I could create another wallet account and pay into that?<br />Or does the limit apply to the PingIt app?<br />I tried to do a bank transfer into the same wallet and I can&#039;t do that either.<br /><br />help appreciated
