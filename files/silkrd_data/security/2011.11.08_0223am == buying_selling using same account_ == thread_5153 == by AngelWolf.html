				hi everyone!<br /><br />i am so HAPPY to have found this place!&nbsp; <br /><br />one question:&nbsp; i do plan on both buying and selling on SR but i was thinking that, if i use, say, this name to sell goods and then turn around and use the same name&nbsp; to purchase something else, my &quot;selling&quot; name could then be tied to an address (be it mine, a friend&#039;s, or a PO box), right?&nbsp; should i set up 2 separate accounts?&nbsp; should i even worry?&nbsp; how do you guys all deal with this?<br /><br />thanks all!<br />xoxo

				*BUMP*<br /><br />hey, i am deadly serious!&nbsp; buying is one thing but selling puts you in a whole different category!&nbsp; this is the safest place for sellers as they can remain anonymous.&nbsp; but no matter how encrypted your address is, once you make a purchase, ONE person will see it who happens to be completely anonymous.&nbsp; to those who buy AND sell, do you all have two separate accounts or do you feel safe using the same one for both?&nbsp; or do you only buy from proven sellers with adequate history backing them up?&nbsp; that&#039;s the trouble with being both merchant and consumer...&nbsp; juggling accounts can fuck you up if you&#039;re fucked up to begin with.&nbsp; ahh, the trails of life.<br /><br />listen, if this is a stupid question just tell me.&nbsp; i&#039;m a big girl (well, not exactly), i can handle it.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been familiar with tor and the privacy/freedom/peace of mind it offers for like a year now.&nbsp; but i am VERY new to silk road.&nbsp; talk about the proverbial icing on the cake!&nbsp; anyway, i&#039;ve been going through these forums learning all that i can since i signed up and i haven&#039;t seen this brought up yet.&nbsp; maybe because it&#039;s too obvious, i don&#039;t know, could anyone please tell me?&nbsp; i&#039;d really appreciate that.<br /><br />thanks.&nbsp; well, i guess i&#039;ll lurk moar for now.&nbsp; god, i miss ED....

				Hey, of course you should set up different accounts for selling / purchasing :) be sure to use names not related to each other ;)

				Yes... it is kinda obvious and you answered your own question. Why would you ever release an address that is associated with a vendor account. There is no cost for a buyer account so you should definitely set one up to make purchases with. And if youre too fucked up to manage two accounts you should almost definitely just do neither&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Great job coming over to the forum and reading up to educate yourself! Good luck, welcome to SR!

				thank you.&nbsp; that&#039;s what i thought but i&#039;m still kinda caught in that &quot;multiple accounts get you banned&quot; mindset drilled into me from years and years and years of online groups and message boards i wanted to be 100% sure because silk road is the only one that really matters, you know, besides the gaming- well, never mind.<br /><br />of course, i could set up dozens of accounts here, couldn&#039;t i, and no one would even know...&nbsp; tor was useful to me for other reasons...&nbsp; whoa!&nbsp; paradigm shift!&nbsp; hahaha, not a problem.&nbsp; just give me a couple of hours.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />thanks for the advice and the warm welcome.&nbsp; :)
