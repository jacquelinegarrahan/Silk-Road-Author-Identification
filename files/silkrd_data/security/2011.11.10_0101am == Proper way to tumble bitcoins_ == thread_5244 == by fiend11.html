				I am in the process of setting up my first purchase, but I&#039;m confused on how to properly tumble any bitcoins I buy. What wallets are good to use to tumble? Is the SR tumbler OK to use on its own? Thanks in advance. <br /><br />

				You don&#039;t need to tumble coins if you&#039;re just buying.

				You don&#039;t need to tumble coins even if you are selling, but if you don&#039;t want to get raided by feds you should tumble coins in either case. Or load anonymously.

				To answer your question in a way that also answers the OP question...<br /><br />If you got your bitcoins by buying them in person from someone you found on like http://tradebitcoin.com/<br />or with a moneypack you paid Cash for in a store (Though if they have cameras in the store and they really want to find you...) and then bought BTC with the MoneyPack from someone on SR or on the #bitcoin-otc irc channel through TOR, then you have nothing to worry about because your identity is not tied to the bitcoins.<br /><br />In any case, if you did want to tumble them. The easiest way would be to just send the coins to SR then send them back to yourself to a new receiving key in different amounts over a few transactions over a few days. SR will have tumbled them for you if you did that.<br /><br />In any case, it is a real pain in the ass to trace bitcoin, and even if they did get some measure of evidence I can not see out it would be strong enough to hold up in court. Just as long as you are not a big fish you should be fine.<br /><br />The only time I would trubble myself would be if you are receving BTC form SR. In that case I would not just go and send them to Mt. GOX and cash out. Try to sell them agin on SR for a MoneyPack and put the MoneyPack money into your PP and cash out like that. That way the BTC stays in SR and stays fully anonymous.<br /><br />...<br />But it is late at night now and I am tired so maybe I am making some logcal errors. Correct me if I am wrong.
