				I&#039;m using GPG Keychain Access on Mac OS X 10.6.8.<br /><br />Short version: I can import new keys and they show up on the list, but when I try to encrypt something the new keys don&#039;t show up, only the ones I&#039;ve used in the past.<br /><br />Long version:<br /><br />I went to import the vendor key like normal, but the right click menu did not have a &#039;Services&#039; section. I deleted a bunch of stuff in a downloads folder recently, including what I thought to be the GPG installer. Assuming I&#039;d messed it up somehow, I uninstalled GPG using AppCleaner and then installed GPG Keychain Access again.<br /><br />All my keys were still there. The &#039;Services&#039; section returned to right click menu and I was able to import the new vendor key. It confirmed who it was and this showed up on the list under the correct name. But now, when I go to encrypt my address, only the keys that were there before show up and the new ones do not, meaning I cannot encrypt anything to them. Something interesting that might help someone work it out: the Silk Road staff key does also not let me import to it. <br /><br />The only difference between the keys that work and the keys that don&#039;t, from what I can tell, is that when you click the little arrow to the left of the vendor key - the ones that work have the sections &#039;pub&#039;, &#039;uid&#039; and &#039;sub&#039;. The ones that don&#039;t work only have &#039;pub&#039; and &#039;uid&#039; (one vendor has 2 &#039;uid&#039;).<br /><br />Any help appreciated. Really really want to buy drugs :)<br />

				Thanks. I uninstalled GPG and then download and installed the top link &#039;GPGKeychainAccess-205n.dmg&#039;. Is this what you meant for me to do? Unfortunately there&#039;s no difference. Sorry if I&#039;m noobing out, it took me hours to work out this stuff in the first place.

				This is the copy of the instructions with a more concise link I received when it happened to me. Sorry, I should have gone back to this post and copied it originally. Good luck! <br /><br />&quot;Try installing/re-installing the nightly build of GPGTools.&nbsp; This has solved this issue for people in the past. https://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-latest.dmg&quot;<br />

				Remember how I linked you to that site that can do online PGP encryption?<br /><br />Here&#039;s a different site, which does it all in client-side JS, no server calls. It doesn&#039;t even offer decryption, so you&#039;re not even given an opportunity to think about fucking up.<br />Note that you&#039;ll need to first use the &quot;OpenPGP Key Extraction&quot; link, and then the actual encryption. You can (and should) use Tor with this site.<br /><br />!!!CLEARNET: http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGencode.htm :CLEARNET!!!<br /><br />Of course, it&#039;s infinitely better to set up a PGP program on your devices, but this is a shortcut for people just wanting to encrypt information to a single vendor&#039;s public key.<br />

				Thanks for the help, +1 both of you. Thankfully another user has helped me get started using PortablePGP, so I think I&#039;ll stick with that in the meantime.
