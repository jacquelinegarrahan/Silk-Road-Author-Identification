				Say you want to transport powder on a plane, like mdma or meth, I&#039;m talking about a small amount, like a gram or so. Would it still be detectable if you simply dissolved it in a small bottle of liquor, screwed the lid on the bottle again and then put it in your regular luggage (not carry-on baggage that you carry with you)? Afterwards you could simply drink the liquor to take the drug. Just wondering because i would like to take some on my holidays but do NOT want to get caught doing so.

				The alcohol might destroy the drug, depending on what it is. Vacuum seal the gram of MDMA, make sure it&#039;s crushed to shit, very powdery. And then put it in your shoe. If you make it very powdery you won&#039;t even feel it when you&#039;re walking. Buy some Dr. Scholl&#039;s and put it underneath the sole insert. <br /><br />That&#039;s what I would do if I wanted drugs while on vacation. It might not be the smartest thing though. I personally would just enjoy my vacation sober, or just get alcohol while I&#039;m there.

				I usually go buy some herbal supplements, open the capsules, empty them, and put the product right in.&nbsp; Then the capsules go back in the bottle, and I just carry it on.&nbsp; Its tedious if you&#039;re trying to haul a lot, but ive had no issues doing it that way.<br /><br />(knock on wood)<br />

But when i went to Cuba there were drug dogs just running around the airports when u walk in and even when u pick up your checked luggage. ive heard its like that in some over countries too. <br /><br />bottom line, be fuckin careful. u might want to consider mailing yourself the stuff express post the week before u leave if u really need to get your shit. most hotels will allow receipt of mail to your name.&nbsp; once your package clears customs just give the hotel a call a day before it will arrive to let them know u are expecting a package and u should be good.<br /><br />take care all.

				speaking of EU you hardly see any drug dogs, mostly for international flights like colombia or common drugstates ;)<br /><br />my job makes me travel alot and you hardly see any lawenforcement during eu flights.<br />so you always can get the chance of not being caught (bad idea :P).<br /><br />i usally tend to take prescription drugs (opioids) with me, they never pay attention to them.<br />And if they do, it&#039;s for my serious backpain, no joking ... sucks. <br /><br />for speedy sakes you can use rc, some of them are really nice. no name a few: 2C-*, *Cathione, *, ... many more<br /><br />most favorable option: going to countries that offer a great variety of kinda legal drugs like:<br />netherlands (lol), switzerland or czech republic.<br /><br />enjoy your flight<br /><br />e.<br />

				Havnt read all this but drugs are detectable in liquids, people used to smuggle in drinks, dissolved coke or whatever, then evaporate it. People have been caught and prosecuted for it.

				A little off-topic but the coolest method for smuggling ive seen to date was weaving an entire carpet with very fine plastic tubing packed with heroin...the tubing was so small and fine it looked just like yarn. They supposedly &quot;caught&quot; this themselves but id bet they where tipped off theres just no way anyone would think of that.
