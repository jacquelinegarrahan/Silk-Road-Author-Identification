				Well another noob here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been poking around and I have almost everything set up.&nbsp; Now to step back, take a breath and think this thru.&nbsp; Basically I would be in the market for a little bit of personal weed, man its been years.&nbsp; Not more than an 1/2 oz.<br />&nbsp; <br />QUESTION:&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the risk in Canada?&nbsp; I know Harper has been putting in crazy crime bills for his &quot;vote for me I&#039;m tough on dopers&quot;&nbsp; Does anyone know if worst came to worst what would it mean for a) a record b) travel c) penalties.&nbsp; Could you be banned from a computer at work?<br /><br />Just need a little reality check here.&nbsp; Your frank opinions are much appreciated.

				If you take the time to do it right and read read read ... the risk reward is better than the streets IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp;but you gotta be willing to read read read and remember your $$$ and freedom depend on your ability to understand the risks. Now excuse me while I go twist a mighty fine one brought to me by SR. Damn I like this place&gt;

				That&#039;s pretty much my thoughts also.&nbsp; This prohibition thing is unraveling at the seams world wide.&nbsp; Especially with the Ontario v. R Matt Mernagh decision from the supreme court due any day.&nbsp; This appeal decision will decide if prohibition is unconstitutional in Ontario.&nbsp; And if so legal weed.&nbsp; Release the hounds!<br /><br />Question:&nbsp; Are there any extra laws on the books in CND regarding the use of the postal service?&nbsp; I know I&#039;d deny and clam up in an unfortunate situation but would 1/2 oz be considered simple possession?

				half Oz first time... with a half decent lawyer it will get thrown out and not appear on your record.... second time... most probably a fine of about 100-300$<br /><br />third time.. same deal as before but a little more cash and maybe even some cummunity service..<br /><br />I am in Canada, The best country in the world!! I also sell some of the best stuff on the road!!<br /><br />Check out my listings , feedback and review thread for more info..<br /><br />But all in all your real safe for a half oz through the mail... Even more so if you buy domestically.<br /><br />John

				The &quot;straight to jail&quot; comment seems a little over the top.&nbsp; Man, I don&#039;t live in Arizona (no offense).&nbsp; All I have to do is look in my local newspaper at the court report and see all the shit the street bullies get away with.&nbsp; I liked the recommendation someone posted that to mark the package &quot;Return to Sender&quot; and leave it sit for a day or so.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In the end I&#039;m thinking what proof do they have and I&#039;d doubt they would sic the their whole IT department on me.&nbsp; ie.e small fish.<br /><br />Still on the fence but when my BTC&#039;s show up, its gong to be harder to say what the hell.&nbsp; Thanks for the comments.<br /><br /><br />
