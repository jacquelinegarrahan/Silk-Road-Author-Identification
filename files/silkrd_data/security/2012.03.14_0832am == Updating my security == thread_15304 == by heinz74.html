				Hi there reading some of the previous post on this subject it’s got me a bit paranoid about my own security. I started off installing tor to my laptop (first mistake should have used a pen drive); also do you need to change any settings in tor? <br />Second: My communications with vendors are all done using PGP, I use a tormail account for buying bit coins and only pay cash into bank accounts.<br />I also have two wallets which I move coins between.<br />Can anyone recommend any good software for cleaning my computer of any trace of tor so that I can put it on a pen drive? <br />Any other recommendations would be much appreciated ;D ;D<br /><br />Cheers <br />Heinz74<br />

				You can use this to sanitize hour hard drive (It&#039;s free):&nbsp; http://pcwin.com/downloads/Dod-Disk-Eraser.htm<br /><br />Install the TOR Bundle and there is no need to change any settings. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend that you learn the Bitcoin System.&nbsp; Your wasting a lot of money buying Bitcoin from the Vendors on this site.&nbsp; They charge premium fee&#039;s for the conversion.&nbsp; I believe the norm is 10-20 percent.&nbsp; You should be able to do it on your own for less than 5 percent.&nbsp; Good luck!<br /><br />Oh, and I would recommend not using Windows.&nbsp; Use Linux on a USB Flash Drive.&nbsp; That way you boot directly from the USB and have absolutely nothing on your hard drive.&nbsp;

				Hi not sure whats the problem with your network , does not sound like what happened to me but in the end i had to switch to tails. tails never saves anything which is nice and it still wipes memory clean and everything. i would have to say liberte has some extra features but if you follow what i did you might accually be better off. so everything you need is mostly online. (tormail/silkroad/ect) the only thing you need to save is gpg. aleast for me. so what i did was start tails but on the language page hit the tab key then type truecrypt. then when tails loads download gpg4usb which is portable, save it to the desktop for now. generate your keys then use truecrypt to make a container and put the gpg4usb in it. once the container is encrypted upload it to any storage site like mydrive.net which is located in switerland with high privacy laws. after that you want to run a dod wipe on the free space of any os or usb drive that had anything to do with silkroad. i use shredder which is free and offers a wide array of options including 35 pass gutman. now if you do that nothing is stored on any usb or computer you have. and the only private data that is stored is on a remote server everything else is wiped after you shutdown tails.<br /><br />Hope that helps, Alpine

				I&#039;d use Truecrypt to encrypt my entire hard drive. Don&#039;t write any passwords down, tell them to anyone, or use any more than once.<br /><br />My passwords are all different from each other and contain strings of random characters. Most of my passwords are saved insie a Truecrypt container since I can&#039;t remember a bunch of strings of random characters.

				I Second not writing your passwords down (at least, not for long).&nbsp; Just memorize them and resign yourself to a complete data loss if you ever forget them.
