				i sent btc from my wallet to my sr account around 5pm this evening<br />according to blockchain.info, the btc reached my sr address, confirmed around 1:20am<br />around 2 am, they left that address, going towards some other address. if i&#039;m reading this right, it says that over 87 btc left the address, which happens to be significantly more than i put into it.<br />is this the tumbler in action, or have i just gotten fucked out of a real nice fucking chunk of change?<br />is there any way to tell?<br />anything to do if i have been fucked, somehow?

				That actually just happened to me the other day. I had bitcoins deposited into my SR address. When I checked the blockchain later to see if the deposit went through, it said that the deposit did go through, and there had also been a withdrawal. It said my final balance was 0 btc. I was freaking out and thinking that someone hacked my SR account, but then I logged on to SR and my money was there. So maybe its just something odd going on with SR&#039;s tumbler?

				That is SR&#039;s fogging system in action, nothing to worry about, it does that with all deposits/withdrawals

				I&#039;ve never seen this happen when I looked at my SR wallet on the blockchain before, though. Previously, if I put money in my SR account, it would say that the money was in my wallet until a few days after I finalized. Now its saying the wallet is empty just hours after depositing the coins. The money was still credited to my account when I logged in so it wasn&#039;t a problem, but it was just scary at first.
