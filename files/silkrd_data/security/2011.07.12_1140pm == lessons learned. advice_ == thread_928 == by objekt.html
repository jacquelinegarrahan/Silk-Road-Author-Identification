				i understand some of this may have been covered, but i&#039;ve struggled to see it.<br /><br />history: SWIM&#039;s virgin transaction went dwolla-&gt;mtgox-&gt;SR.&nbsp; it wasn&#039;t a heavy purchase, but the understanding is that it SHOULD have gone dwolla-&gt;mtgox-&gt;eWallet-&gt;SR, all via TOR to generic accounts. EXCEPT for dwolla, which was a bank transfer.<br /><br />question: should i consider this SR burned to future purchases? the mtgox account was accessed securely and insecurely over months to LEGITIMATE email address... (lessons learned).&nbsp; new anonymous accounts will be created and accessed via TOR ONLY, using hushmail, except for dwolla... what to do?&nbsp; is all that nessecary? if the bitcoins can be tracked back to a legitimate transfer from dwolla where is the trail lost?<br /><br />this interest in bitcoin and SR never lead to explicit instructions and now future purchases need to be protected. whats the best procedure? people have said dwolla&gt;mtgox&gt;ewallet&gt;sr, but how can anonymous monies be deposited into mtgox? feeling that disposable credit cards is overkill and that level of security isn&#039;t needed...

				If you take your cash from mtgox and run it through a tumbler, then have it incrementally deposited out to your ewallet (some of the tumbler services do 5 or 10 withrawals and do this for 0.02 BTC for the service), it would be practically impossible to trace from there.&nbsp; Then you can run it straight into SR.&nbsp; from your ewallet.<br /><br />SR has a built in tumbler, and while some people have claimed that the outgoing only goes to one BTC address, you can transfer out to a tumbler again on your way out, then incrementally back to your ewallet and then to MtGox if you wish to cash out.&nbsp; Basically it is extremely hard to actually identify WHO is at an address, but it theoretically can be done (I&#039;m not sure if it has yet - if anyone has heard please post it!).&nbsp; That being said all you are doing with bitcoin native is downloading the latest block, and your transaction (if applicable) would be logged within that block - address-to-address.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t actually have a receiving IP just a BTC address and if your address is in that block it simply has to be downloaded 5 times to confirm the transaction.<br /><br />If you cash out to something like LR instead of Dwolla it is much harder to trace because a) LR is offshore, and b) you can make LR payments anonymous.&nbsp; I use LR and Pecunix (although I can&#039;t use Dwolla because I&#039;m not in the US - I wouldn&#039;t anyway except to put funds into Mtgox and only as a second-string to LR).<br /><br />Just add in a tumbler on each side in between MtGox and e-wallet, and you remove virtually any risk of having your BTC address linked.<br /><br />I am way more worried about landing myself in an LE exit node on Tor than I am about BTC though.&nbsp; I can just imagine a prosecutor trying to explain BTC addresses to a jury... lol.

				I wouldn&#039;t be using your old dwolla, mtgox, SR or email accounts for any new SP purchases.&nbsp; To be totally anonymous, start from scratch with new accounts.

				well, i am only putting money into SR and am not a seller.&nbsp; i am trying to make all new accounts through TOR only, but my problem is getting USD into the &#039;system&#039;.&nbsp; Dwolla takes a bank transfer, and is clearly linked to myself (my account, my real email).&nbsp; from there it goes mtgox-&gt;mybitcoin-&gt;SR.&nbsp; What are some of these tumbler services (i&#039;ll google i guess...)?<br /><br />i feel if i use anonymous NEW accounts, but even ONE of them is traceable, then all will be linked.<br /><br />am i missing how to make a anonymous dwolla account?&nbsp; i AM NOT going to mail cash off and hope someone deposits it. too long, too risky.&nbsp; i haven&#039;t used LR at all, maybe that is something i should consider.<br /><br />jurors learning bitcoin... i have a hard enough time explaining it to the g/f even after a month.<br /><br />i am not totally paranoid, but its educational and i want to do whats right by the community.

				@bp you should be fine<br />Silk Road uses 1 time unique deposit addresses that go into a tumbler. Even if LE could track it to Silk Road, which would be very difficult for a one time address, is that some bitcoin you once had ended up somehow getting onto Silk Road. This is the forensic equivalent of testing $100 for cocaine residue - more than 75% of them do (or whatever the stat is on cocaine residue on money is)<br /><br />Taking bitcoin OUT of Silk Road might be a little more tricky, but going in you should be fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;Extra precautions never hurt but you should not be too stressed out about it.

				@arachno47<br />Please correct me if I am wrong, but bitcoinlaundry.com is not actually a tumbler, at least not according to the forum.bitcoin.org thread.<br />It just adds one simple address to the chain, like sending it to yourself. This is not ANY protection and should not be used.<br /><br />Not to be confused with https://bitlaundry.appspot.com/ - which is a mixer/tumbler <br /><br />(and just to make it more confusing the first guy just bought out the second one.)<br />
