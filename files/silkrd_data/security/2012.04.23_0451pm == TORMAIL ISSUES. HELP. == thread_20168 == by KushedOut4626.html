				tormail.net is now tormail.org, the hidden service is still the same. And gmail isn&#039;t friendly towards Tor, if you try connecting through too many exit nodes your account&#039;ll get locked and you&#039;ll need to unlock it with a mobile number.

This happens if the account is usually accessed from the same area (IP range), then suddenly from a different IP, and phone verification is set.<br />If the IP range or the area I use to access the acc is similar or close by to the usual place, there is no problem. If it&#039;s different, or it&#039;s a known Tor exit node, then there is a verification process.<br />In case there was no security questions or phone validation set on the account, you need to tell the name of the area where the account was accessed from in the past.<br />In case of security questions, those needs to be answered.<br />But in case of phone validation the acc get frozen, and you need to verify it via phone to open it up again.<br /><br />Most exit nodes are blocked anyway, I was unable to open an acc without a mandatory phone verification.<br />I had no problems with my past accounts though.

Although I&#039;m not certain, I think you need an e-mail to set up PGP, or maybe to register a seller&#039;s account(although I&#039;m pretty sure making a fake one like weed@dank.com would work). Best to have one also so that customers may contact you even in the case that SR is shut down.

				Hehe - N/P. Everything works externally just like it used to - you just have to use .org now (tormail.net is GONE from the real Internet - probably forever). <br /><br />Internally (in squirrel-mail/round-cube/thunderbird-tor), the .net addresses _will_ still work (again, internally ONLY), but I just wouldn&#039;t use them anymore. Id say just get used to everything being tormail.org now, and be done with it. <br /><br />-<br />KC<br />&nbsp;<br />P.S. - I don&#039;t like some of the potential security implications that could _possibly_ arise from this - but that&#039;s another topic, for another day.
