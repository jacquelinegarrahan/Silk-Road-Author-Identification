				All VPNs keep logs of some sort, and even if they didn&#039;t, LE can simply tap the VPN&#039;s bandwidth provider and watch as you connect to it live.<br /><br />The real question should be why the fuck did DPR use a VPN, and oh fuck it. Just thinking about this gives me a headache.

				Anyone who says &quot;screw vpns&quot; doesn&#039;t know how to use them.<br /><br />A good VPN owner will not go to jail for you, but you will not go to jail when the cops are at his door.&nbsp; If he ran it right, he would have absolutely no records of who did what through his VPN, or who connected at what times to his VPN.<br /><br />Also if you&#039;re doing something major you should learn to tunnel VPNs...

				The core problem is that there are only two categories of VPN providers:<br />1. Providers that say they log for various reasons.&nbsp; <br />2. Providers that *say* they don&#039;t log.<br /><br />Note that Category 2 was NOT &quot;Providers who don&#039;t log&quot;, because from a trust perspective, you have no way of knowing that.&nbsp; That you have any way of verifying, anyway.&nbsp; So you&#039;re relying on shit they write on their website and a vague feeling that you haven&#039;t *heard* of them giving anybody up.&nbsp; And everybody talks a good game before the National Security Letter shows up.&nbsp; <br /><br />VPN&#039;s have their place, but at the point where you&#039;re stuck evaluating the subtle differences between two commercial VPN providers, you&#039;re probably doing it wrong.<br />

Therefore they do not protect the anonymity of your identity in any way other than perhaps by encrypting identifying traffic that you may be transmitting. <br /><br />TOR on the other hand does protect our identity to some extent at least by protecting it from disclosure which is what we worry about round here rather than proving who we are (PGP is for that). The reason it protects our anonymity is that it is (we trust) very difficult to see both ends of the connection unlike a VPN. Neither the client, not the server, nor anything in between known the identity of both endpoints. This is especially true for hidden services.<br /><br />A somewhat tortured analogy would be:<br /><br />I want to communicate with Alice by post. So I hire a courier to take a postcard from my house to my friend Alice. The courier picks up the postcard and takes it to Alices house. The courier knows my address (the sender), Alices address (the destination) and the message I wrote on the postcard.<br /><br />But I want to protect my message from disclosure so the next time I send the message I write it in a letter with an envelope. The envelope stops the courier from reading my message. However the courier still knows that I sent a message to Alice and they still know my address but they don&#039;t know what is in the message without opening the envelope. That, sir, is a VPN.<br /><br />Me ======&gt; Alice<br /><br />Now if I didn&#039;t want the courier to see the message and I didn&#039;t want them to know who the recipient was I would write my letter, put it in an envelope addressed to Alice as before. But now I would then put that envelope in another envelope this time addressed to Bob. Then, for good measure, I would take that envelope and stick the whole lot in a third envelope addressed to Carol. Then I call the courier, they come round and pick up the envelope addressed to Carol and deliver it to his house. Carol opens the envelope and sees that there is another envelope inside with Bobs address so she calls up the courier and they come round and pick up the envelope and deliver it to Bobs house. Bob then opens the envelope to find, again, another envelope inside, this time addressed to Alice. So Bob calls the courier and they come round pick up the envelope and deliver to Alice.<br /><br />So now, not only does the courier not know what was in the message - they also are now unaware that the message I sent was for Alice. That sir, is TOR. Imagine a few thousand people sending messages in this manner at the same time and you will understand it is hard to pick apart for the courier.<br /><br />Me======&gt; Bob ========&gt; Carol =========&gt; Alice<br /><br />So, clear as mud?<br /><br />Trust me I&#039;m a doctor.<br /><br />

				No. America has no data retention laws. But you&#039;re still right. It is the worst possible place to host a VPN because everything is under total police surveillance and state control. Whatever they don&#039;t suck up with their illegal spying they&#039;ll use a national security letter to go after whoever is hosting the VPN you connected to. Then they can track the original connecting IP without the VPN provider&#039;s knowledge (what happened to DPR).

				The very fact that the *sole* OWNER/OPERATOR of the largest illegal online marketplace in history trusted anyone--let alone forums users or other people he MET ON THE INTERNETS within the last two years--to such a degree is absolutely unbelievable.<br /><br />I mean, he presumably met these individuals after SR was already in operation. Either he was overly idealistic and had no common sense, or perhaps DPR was developmentally challenged or had some serious personality issues. He was book smart, but that&#039;s about it. He didn&#039;t just receive fake IDs with his pics on it... at the place he was staying at... Which was in the US. He left trails on the clearnet as well as other breadcrumbs that allowed LE to confirm his identity once they got close.<br /><br />Did I mention he had millions of dollars? It&#039;s not that hard to cash out btc when you can travel all around the world.

				So is it bad to be using a VPN in conjunction with TOR?&nbsp; I know a good bit about computers but not as much as some of you I&#039;d suspect.&nbsp; It just seems like in a lot of these threads people are arguing the facts.&nbsp; I&#039;m a seeker of truth.&nbsp; I just want to know if I should be using tor browser only or a VPN + tor browser?

				I always thought one of the main advantages in using VPN -&gt; Tor was it hid the fact from the ISP that you were using Tor. Even if you are using a public Wi-Fi, if you live in an area where not many people use Tor, and LE knows that someone is shipping drugs from your area, they could always look for where Tor is being accessed from. So using a VPN (obviously hosted in an uncooperative country and paid for by fogged bitcoin) to access Tor at the public wi-fi spots would protect you from such a &quot;pattern of life&quot; attack.<br /><br />What am I missing?
