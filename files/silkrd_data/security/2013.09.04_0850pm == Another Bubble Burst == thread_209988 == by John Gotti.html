				Looks like the latest BTC bubble is finally bursting. that was a decent size bubble, hitting a high over $149 on MTGox. today its sliding $140 now mtgox, $123.70 on bitstamp. Will it have a big drop? oh the drama with bitcoins!<br />remember those days where you can get bitcoins ahead of time and sit on them without worrying they will lose half their value?

As soon as bitcoins took off past $100 then $200+ then crashed, these coins haven&#039;t been the same.And it doesn&#039;t discriminate who it hurts. <br /><br />Now mtgox is @ $117 with weighted average @ $135. That is coming down now but if you buy now you will lose money fooshoo. buying btc @$135 when the current price is $117 is insane.<br />Bitstamp is at $116.90. What a difference!It sucks.

				If the price of BTC goes down, that would be a benefit to the customer, but bad for a vendor, correct? Or is it just as equally shitty for everyone?

				shitty for everyone. its just like how shoplifters hurt customers, because what a merchant losses he must pass along to the customer. not only the value dropping the the difference in pricing from different exchanges too.SR is between bitstamp and mtgox. so if you buy at mtgox you lose, never mind the fees you will have to pay too if any. <br />you used to be able to buy coin, put them in your wallet and worry if you lost a quarter over night. now you lose $20+ a coin whiile you sleep. btc went from $12 to $20 to $100, to $200 and to $250 in a very short time period. people were dancing in the aisles because their coins were increasing everyday then within hours crashed to below $100. they have be incredibly unstable since. And being the cheap fuck that i am it seems to be only bothering me! lol&nbsp;

				It&#039;s been such a good deal lately, with the SR price substantially higher than what I pay for coins, so while I don&#039;t like seeing the value of the coins in my SR account decreasing, I&#039;m not sweating it.

				never let emotions dictate your buying/selling strategy.&nbsp; &nbsp;if there is a good reason to sell, then sell.&nbsp; but if you have no idea why the price is dropping, then you do not sell, you hold on (if you can) or buy more.&nbsp; there is a reason recurring-buy strategies work great for people who are confident in long-term value growth of an investment.&nbsp; that is, if you invest $100 every week, no matter what the price of btc, some weeks you will buy high and by the end of the week you&#039;ll have lost some value.&nbsp; but over the course of a year or two or five, you will have a winning strategy because you&#039;re averaging out the volatility.
