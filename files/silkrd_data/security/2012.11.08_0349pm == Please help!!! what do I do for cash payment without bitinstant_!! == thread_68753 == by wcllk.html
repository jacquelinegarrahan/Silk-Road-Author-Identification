				www.bitcopia.com accepts cash deposits and seems anonymous. I don&#039;t think you even have to put your name on the order. Never bought from them, but I sold them some coins for cash in the mail and got it the next day.

				Bitinstant is supposedly returning later today according to their support team. Not sure how much I trust that though.<br /><br />Anyone other reputable members that can vouch for bitcopia or other cash to btc services?

				With so many people wanting BTC&#039;s you would think a reputable vendor would step up and help out.&nbsp; I have been trying to get up with Captainmal all day and I have gotten no response.&nbsp; Please?&nbsp; Are there any reputable BTC vendors online?

				------REPOST--------<br /><br /><br /><br />It appears that as of 10:00 am EST BitInstant is up but no Tor friendly.&nbsp; It can be accessed by Explorer or Moxilla or whatever.&nbsp; I will say that I placed and order and while they confirmed payment I looked at the block chain and there were no deposits in my wallet.&nbsp; I emailed them waiting a response

				I&#039;m checking out btc-e.com myself...but I have an okPay accnt, if I need it, for depositing...or mtGox, but there&#039;s some problems on the verification thing, so can&#039;t use dwolla...and to get money into okPay, have to give up too much info also...I&#039;ll figure a way, but this is turning into a pain again...<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=40889.0<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BTC-E<br />https://btc-e.com/

				Both bitinstant and mtgox are working just fine for me...of course, I don&#039;t use tor for either so maybe that has something to do with it? I haven&#039;t made a deposit though to see if that&#039;s up and running however...come on paycheck!! <br />@JacobBang, did you get your btc yet??<br />Really hoping they get their shit together so I can make a large purchase soon!!
