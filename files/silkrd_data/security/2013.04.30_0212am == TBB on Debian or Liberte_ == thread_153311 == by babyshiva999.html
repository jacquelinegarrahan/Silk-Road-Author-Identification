				I&#039;ve been trying to get some answers regarding this particular matter, searching the forums, etc, but nothing of substance. Hope some of you guys can share some of your insight with me. <br /><br />I understand that Liberte is the golden standard - but in terms of degree of security how would you compare these two TBB on Debian vs Liberte? <br /><br />Is there a major difference that would force one to stick with Liberte - I have tried it and I can operate within it fine, since I&#039;ve been a Linux user for years, nonetheless my main issue is - whether the security is radically better with Liberte as opposed to TBB on Debian.<br /><br />Many thanks,

				Are you talking about Threading Building Blocks?<br /><br />If so, from what I read it mainly is just a library to run multi-threaded code faster/better(aka make those multi-core CPU work!).&nbsp; I have not seen ANY reference to security directly... now I suppose the method of how it works could improve some security at little&nbsp; (info in memory or something, dunno).<br /><br />Liberte is safer due to a few reasons... of which you could mimic close enough with pretty much ANY OS..<br /><br />1. Tor communication... Everything goes through Tor on Liberte according to their site...&nbsp; &nbsp;No need to use the TOR browser exclusively, I am guessing is the benefit.&nbsp; Just use Tor and you are close enough for casual SR (at least browser based communication is concerned)<br /><br />2. Live USB/CD... The OS can be used on any computer and travels/hides well.&nbsp; Any OS can do this too...<br /><br />3. Encrypted drive... Again this can be done on any OS... Just encrypt your whole drive with any number of good encryption software.<br /><br />4. More securely setup... so you don&#039;t get hacked and viri...&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter much unless you are using it constantly for your needs.&nbsp; There are many solutions to this as well, from revertible VM (if you do get viri, just revert and poof gone.) to a static liveCD (can&#039;t edit/change main OS systems).<br /><br />Obviously security needs can vary from seller/high SR user to casual...&nbsp; But the fact remains that you can build secure solutions with almost any OS you want.&nbsp; It all depends on your risk threshold and requirements.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Boy am I dumb... Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)...<br /><br />Yes any traffic through Tor browser is pretty much the same... Liberte I believe sends ALL traffic via TOR so you could use say an email app and such... While TBB encryption is limited to web sites accessed via the TBB browser only.<br /><br />

				Liberte is also better because is has persistant entry guards.&nbsp; That is what makes it slightly more anonymous than TAILS.
