				First off, please excuse my noobness! Now to business. I am currently using tails on a usb drive. It is my understanding that tails is not compatible with vpn&#039;s correct? I am also under the impression that vpn&#039;s can be used from the router?? I dont think my current router is compatible with a vpn (went through the setup menu and didnt find anything about vpn&#039;s). I have never used a vpn and my question is can I use a router that was not provided by my internet provider? If so recommendations on brands or models?

				Maybe it depends on the VPN (I haven&#039;t used alot of them) but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case.<br /><br />If you use something Hide My Ass, there is a client you download that logs you into one of their multiple servers around the world.<br /><br />Fairly sure you can get it on all OS.<br /><br />

				You don&#039;t need to buy a new modem to use VPN.&nbsp; VPN is a Virtual Private Network that you usually pay for either monthly or per gb.&nbsp; Do a google search on &quot;openvpn&quot; which is an open source VPN module that is quite popular and adopted by many companies.&nbsp; You rent the VPN usually from a website and you will have log-on info and password just like any normal account.&nbsp; Before you choose your VPN provider make sure they aren&#039;t shady or rubbing elbows with LE, a little google-fu and you should find a provider you feel comfortable with.&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t actually need to use the VPN info on tails and as you said it is not quite &quot;compatible&quot;, but there are ways to tunnel a vpn through tails using&nbsp; root terminal..but...&nbsp; This will probably lead to many headaches and questions wondering why the fuck it won&#039;t work when you&#039;re typing what it says to type.&nbsp; But to get to the point about not needing a VPN overlapping TAILS is because &quot;the primary major strength of Tails is its boot to shutdown encryption of all Internet traffic (certainly anything system related)&quot;.<br /><br />Sorry if I didn&#039;t get to exactly what you looking for but I hope it helped a little and will encourage you to do personal research to understand TAILS and VPN and networks in general.<br />

The client can be installed as an add-on to DD-WRT. Some routers come with an OpenVPN client installed. You can search a site like Newegg to find them.<br /><br />
