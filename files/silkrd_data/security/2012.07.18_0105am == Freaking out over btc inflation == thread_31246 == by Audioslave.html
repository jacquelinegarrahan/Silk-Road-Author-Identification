				http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg360ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zcv<br />this shows that in a couple of months, BTC will inflate by about double...i was planning on buying some a few days ago when they were steady at about 7.6 and they&#039;re now 8.85! Should i buy some now and wait to purchase until it inflates more or will it drop?

				At rates like this I only buy the amount of BitCoin I need. When it is lower I buy excess. It&#039;s like stocks but more volatile thus more fun haha.

				Just gonna point this out as it seems to be a common error:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inflation is where a currency loses value (compared to goods and services) over time.<br /><br />What the BTC is experiencing is deflation.<br /><br />The BTC is actually designed to deflate over the long term due to the limited number that will ever be produced, filling a increasing demand. That&#039;s why it can be split into such tiny fragments. The theory is that eventually we will be using 0.1, and 0.01 and 0.001 BTC.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the current rise is part of this trend tho.

Because BTC has been experiencing so much deflation (rise in price), he fears that there will be big inflation (dropping price) coming soon. Which is indeed to be expected.<br /><br />So he is actually scared for the coming inflation, rather than the current deflation.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31246.msg352944#msg352944">Quote from: Hungry ghost on July 18, 2012, 05:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The BTC is actually designed to deflate over the long term due to the limited number that will ever be produced, filling a increasing demand.

However I don&#039;t think we will ever really do transactions in microBTC. If digital currency ever gets widely accepted, alternative digital currencies will be created. BitCoin will probably still be the most prestigious original crypto-currency, and therefore be valuable. But I don&#039;t think we&#039;re ever gonna see $1000 per BTC.

				i would only buy BTC right now if I was planning to place an order right away.&nbsp; in fact, thats usually how i do it, but since i typically buy a couple extra coin than what I actually need i have a small surplus in my wallet.&nbsp; if it keeps rising I may be able to get a quarter ounce of dank weed for coin that I payed 50 bucks for!&nbsp; psyched about this :)<br /><br />but i hear you guys, its nerve wracking, and I too wish it would just stay constant.&nbsp; at the rate its been climbing its almost guaranteed to drop just as hard in a few weeks time.<br /><br />just buy em if you need em, don&#039;t try to &quot;play the market.&quot;&nbsp; there&#039;s much better ways to gamble/invest your money

				This is pure speculation, if you&#039;ll pardon the pun, but since Kim Dotcom was told about Bitcoin in response to his questions about payment methods that can&#039;t be seized, the increase in value could be the result of his (and similar groups) moving into the market.&nbsp; Plus there has been increased press coverage of the currency so it could just be traders diving into it again like they did last year when the price got up to $30 or so.<br />

				Well then I hope those investors will enjoy the extreme drop that happened last time ^_^ I know I will because they will all get scared and when it drops so low and I&#039;ll be getting a surplus.&nbsp; 8)
