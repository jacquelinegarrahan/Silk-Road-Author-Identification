				Hi all,<br /><br />Just trying my best to figure everything out and get myself well set up for life on the road. Need your help with something. Installed Liberte Linux on USB and when booting i get what seems to be an error and it won&#039;t start up unless i type &#039;startx&#039; i think it was. Is this normal ? Or is this a problem ?<br /><br />Then it doesn&#039;t pick up my wireless internet connection after putting in the password, it just won&#039;t connect ?<br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to find some easy to follow tips on what is causing all this or how to fix it. Is anyone able to help me out in some simple easy to follow steps as i kinda get lost in all this stuff.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Not sure about your startup issue, but I have the same problem with wireless. It sees the wireless network and prompts for a PW, but it won&#039;t connect. I have been using hardwire ethernet.<br /><br />I did some research and I read about how Liberte randomizing the wireless MAC address may be preventing the connection from happening. There are some commands you can supposedly issue to turn of wireless MAC randomization, but I couldn&#039;t get them to work. Even if I could, wouldn&#039;t that be a bad thing? And compromise anonymity?<br /><br />Anyway, if you find a solution to the WiFi thing please let us know.<br /><br />Thx

So when you boot up from the USB you get the red hammer and sickel splash screen and then you have to type in your password (which you can&#039;t see!!) followed by a carriage return? You might have to do this three times!<br />Then you get another splash screen with all the icons at the bottom -?<br />So for Wireless operation you have to set it up using the wireless setup application. You have to enter the SSID of your router first, then select the type of encrytion - either WPA or WEP , then the password, or wireless key. You also have to setup the wireless Mode, either infrastructure or adhoc. You need&nbsp; infrastructure (I assume you are using a router - because if you are not then you will have to tell me what you are using).<br />Once you have entered this info, you save it and exit the application. Now you should be connected to the internet and you should not need to enter the password again.<br />I am doing all this from memory since at the moment I am not using Liberte Linux, but Tor browser bundle on a windows machine. So if doing the above does not help, get back to me and I&#039;ll check it out.<br />

				same question here about having to put in &quot;startx&quot; upon starting liberte off usb<br /><br />boot off usb, lots of script/text goes by. then asks for pw, put password in and have to push enter twice, then more text goes by then says somthing falied but you can bypass by typing &quot;startx&quot;. so you type &quot;startx&quot; and it seems perfectly fine, im able to connect to the internet and everything. only had usb for a couple days. have not purchased or transfered anything yet while using it

				Can you tell us what exactly has failed? Because I have never seen this and can&#039;t help otherwise.<br />And&nbsp; OP - G.O.A.T - if you are reading this, can post if your problem sorted now? Thanks guys. :)

				I have same problem. I read about it a bit and it seems that there might be some hardware conflict (like two graphic cards controllers), that&#039;s why X autoconfiguration fails.<br /><br />On official liberte forum, you can get some help, but typing startx every single time isn&#039;t a big deal<br /><br />VP

				So basically from the start what i did was:<br /><br />Downloand the file, then extract onto usb, Launch setup.bat in liberte folder., Run as administrator in Vista and in Windows 7, Re start and boot from usb, entered my chosen password, then the error pops up saying to enter &#039;startx&#039; which then seems to work fine.<br /><br />It does actually pick up my connection but after entering the password it just doesn&#039;t connect.<br /><br />It says on the liberte linux documentation the following :<br />&#039;Some wireless networks (mainly unsecured hotspots, but sometimes secured networks with guest authentication) require web registration before full connectivity is available. Since all network traffic in Libert√© is routed via Tor, which requires such connectivity to operate, this situation is problematic. The solution is to run the Unsafe Browser (which bypasses the firewall) in order to register&#039;<br /><br />How exactly do i do this and &#039;register&#039; ?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				This only applies to splash-page authentication, like if you&#039;re at Starbucks or the airport using their free WiFi. This is not the problem you and I are experiencing.

				Some further things i notice after booting :<br /><br />Error for wireless request &#039;set power management&#039; set failed on device wlan0 operation not supported.<br /><br />Also,<br /><br />Configuring x server...<br />(red star) Error xconfig failed to start<br />You may still attempt to start x server without a configuration file using &#039;startx&#039;<br /><br />&#039;error for wireless request&#039;

				Sorry taken so long to get back to you. Now you guys have two different problems and one problem common to both of you, which is&nbsp; the startX. The &quot;set power management&quot; you can ignore, it is not a problem.<br />&nbsp;I am puzzled by screenshot from qwerty12345, how did you get automatic login? <br /><br />If you guys are happy to use the startx then do so!<br />G.O.A.T&nbsp; - I will try and sort out your wireless problem although ATM I can&#039;t think what it can be.<br />You could try asking question on Liberete forum like VinniPukh suggests. <br />Anything unusual about your hardware??<br />

				i dont know what it means by &quot;automatic login&quot; i had put the password in before that came up.<br />and about having to do &quot;startx&quot; it must be because of hardware as stated above because it runs just fine on another computer.
