				Is it okay if I go on bit instant and do the cash deposit option directly to my silk road account? I would print the deposit slip from a public computer with a one time only email address. Sending money through a bunch of instawallets and systems sounds more secure, but also complex and redundant.

				yes, very easy to do anonymously.&nbsp; you can use tor with bitinstant. i like sending to instawallet simply because the funds appear right away, when you send directly to sr you usually have to refresh your sr page&nbsp; 1000x before the funds appear.<br /><br />would likely want to change your sr address often, so your not seen with a history of sending money gram to the same btc address at same store for many months, just in case, that would make it easy for you to be investigated if you are being targeted.<br /><br />instawallet is more important when using services like mt gox

				its this simple. <br /><br />1) set up a blockchain.info account under tor and <br /><br />2) login to your blockchain wallet and find your bitcoin address under &#039;RECEIVE BITCOINS&#039;<br /><br />3) go to bitinstant and select: major bank branch &gt; bitcoin address<br />- email: put in a random mailinator address<br />- bitcoin address: put in your bitcoin address from blockchain<br />- amount: whatever your heart so desires<br /><br />4) it will redirect you to a trustcash site<br />- submit your zip code and choose the closest bank to you<br />- it will make you print a piece of paper that you will end up giving to the bank teller<br /><br />5) go to bank with cash and the printed paper<br />- no ID is required. if asked for it, say you never needed it before and you left it at home.. but they never ask<br /><br />- the bitcoins will show up in your blockchain wallet literally within minutes.<br /><br />6) now go to insawallet.org and it will give you your own personal site with your bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose this link, you lose anything in your instawallet.<br /><br />7) go back to blockchain wallet and click on &#039;SEND BITCOINS&#039; then simply enter in your&nbsp; INSTAWALLET BITCOIN ADDRESS <br /><br />- so now you have moved your bitcoins from blockchain to instawallet.<br /><br />8) now open up another instawallet page with a new instawallet bitcoin address. bookmark also.<br /><br />9) send from your first instawallet to this second instawallet address.<br /><br />10) now go to SR under the &quot;ACCOUNT&quot; link, you&#039;ll find your SR bitcoin address.<br /><br />11) you can now simply send the bitcoins from your second instawallet to SR.<br /><br />so to simplify it looks like this:<br /><br />bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR<br /><br />if you&#039;re ultra paranoid and want to launder (BLEACH) your coins further you can go for this formula:<br /><br />bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; bitcoinfog &gt; SR<br /><br />i personally choose blockchain over mt gox because i can use tor on that site. mt gox can suddenly freeze your account pending photo id verification. who needs the hassle? blockchain ftw.

				yes, you can easily do that .. but why not just use instawallet for the extra peace of mind? it&#039;s completely free and easy.. so no need to skip the instawallet step. up to you but being safe is extremely important if you want to enjoy SR.<br />

				I&#039;ve been sending my deposits directly to SR.&nbsp; The one time I sent it to my wallet on Bitcoin-qt i didn&#039;t get my bitcoins for two days because I didn&#039;t realize I had to download the entire bitcoin transaction history.&nbsp; I guess since I&#039;ve done that now I wont have to wait but its pretty easy to just send to your sr account.

				Agreed Anon I made the same shitty mistake.....I use a pretty simple method now. Set up through bitinstant using the bitcoin address option, to go into your SR address, go to walmart fill out a money gram for BILL PAYMENT (can&#039;t stress that enough any other transaction and they ask for an ID) fill it out with false info pay and in apx 4 hrs you will have your funds in your SR account I plan to change addresses every month just to switch it up....Complacency and paranoia are separate things, Bitcoins whether sent anonymous or not aren&#039;t really all that much of a risk for a buyer. Its when your spending your bitcoins, address, and receiving a package that things get tricky....Research the forums heavily for vendor reviews before you buy and always wait one day before opening your packaging just in case the DICKS in BLUE come pounding at your door asking questions...As of now I would say SR is pretty safe and easy to use but as it grows and more inexperienced inpatient, and possible underage users join it will start taking a nose dive.

				&nbsp;8) I used Walmart---&gt;Bitinstant---&gt;Mt.Gox---&gt;Instawallet---&gt;New SR Address requested after getting home from WM.&nbsp; The BTC was in my SR account in less than 2 hours for the whole thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t forget to ask WM for an &quot;Expressgram&quot; slip, that&#039;s the one you pay bills with, and make sure you list the company as the one on the Bitinstant slip, I think its called Kwick Slip or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;They didn&#039;t ask for ID or anything, you can give them a fake name if you want.&nbsp; I don&#039;t start TORing until the Instawallet step.&nbsp; It should be good enough to cover your tracks, keep it simple and don&#039;t do anything outrageous, sit on the coins for a bit after you get them, a couple days, just to keep the amount of time as unpredictable as possible.&nbsp; We all want our gear ASAP, but that&#039;s not how the world works.&nbsp; It sure as hell beats going to a dangerous neighborhood, buying from gang members, and having your license plate/face scanned.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -GGGreenbud

				This is my first attempt at using SR, but I used: Bitinstant (CVS) - Blockchain - SR.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see how it works.&nbsp; I&#039;m not as worried about the BTC aspect of it as much as making sure the seller packages it properly.<br /><br />On a side note, Blockchain has an option to send BTC anonymously for a %1.5 fee.&nbsp; I tried this, but was having trouble getting it to work.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how effective it is either.&nbsp; Any tech guys know anything about blockchain&#039;s autonomous transfer option and how it works?

				When you use Bitinstant . use a fake name, a fake address, (but make sure its in your zip code) and a fake phone #. ...answer the dumb ass questions and pay the bill. They will ask is this you first time using and you say yes. the transfer is free....they will ask the amount tell the the full amount. the receiver code and account #. thats all. pay the cashier give them the same info who gave before if they ask (they don&#039;t need ID) . Thats it...they will give you a receipt.. keep it untill your BTCs show up when they do destroy ...I send my BTC directly to SR. done this every single time and never had an issue
