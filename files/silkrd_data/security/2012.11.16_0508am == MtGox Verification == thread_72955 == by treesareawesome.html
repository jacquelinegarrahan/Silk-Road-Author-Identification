				Hey everybody,<br /><br />I deposited a couple hundy to MtGox and they requested a photocopy of my drivers license, I obliged and sent it to them as to not make a fuss and so I have access to my money (my account is still clean, was my first deposit/transaction). Am I now able to send it to another bitcoin service and then place my SR order safely, or should I withdraw the money back to my bank account and use another bitcoin service.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your replies, supersiiiighhh... I just want my LSD already.<br /><br />-Treesareawesome

				treesareawesome<br /><br />Yes, once you have deposited with MtGox you exchange you funds for bitcoins. From there you can transfer your coins through another bitcoin service provider and onto SR. I would recommend running through a couple of ewallets before depositing to SR and through a couple of ewallets again if you are going to be withdrawing from SR<br /><br />Instawallet (https://www.instawallet.org) is my ewallet provider of choice, no signup necessary. Just browse the url and it will generate a bitcoin address for you to deposit to. DO NOT lose the wallet url, you will lose the coins you deposited. Best way I&#039;ve found is to bookmark the ewallet address url, then reload it to make sure it&#039;s the same and then deposit/transfer the funds.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be withdrawing regularly or significant amounts, I would advise the use of a mixing service before transferring through a couple of ewallets and back into MtGox to sell and cash out.<br /><br />MJMuse

				Blockchain.info has a mixing service. Google it.I &#039;ve used it once it was fast, the fees were 1,5% i think.<br />Just transferring your whole amount of coins through 1-2 wallets doesn&#039;t do much for covering your tracks, it would be pretty obvious for someone to understand what happened. Although legally that could be enough, i have no idea about that.

It is very fast and it does cost 1.5%, however it&#039;s not necessary to mix your funds on deposit, ewallets should suffice. If you transfer through instawallet when depositing and let the funds sit there for a while after confirmation, they will get mixed around in their internal pool. It&#039;s not enough to significantly mask the coins, you could still run them through a taint analyzer and find some common originating addresses. <br /><br />If your dealing in small deposits, transferring through 3 instawallets is probably enough. I don&#039;t think MtGox, or any other exchange for that matter, cares too much about how you spend the coins. They are much more interested in where the coins you have originated from. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t use them.<br /><br />MJMuse

As a newbie, I&#039;m loving these nuggets of advice. Just to clarify, you wouldn&#039;t recommend the use of MtGox even with the use of a mixing service and several ewallets? Do you think MtGox really investigates thoroughly where the coins come from? They&#039;ve got to be aware where the vast majority come without checking. For my first few withdrawals, I cashed out directly from SR before I started covering my tracks more. Would you think that account is tainted now and I should use another? <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Marcel.

				What makes mtgox decide that you need verification? I&#039;ve used them 2 times now after bitinstant got rid of the &quot;cash deposit directly to wallet&quot; option (and they have it back now but you&#039;re supposed to put your full name and birthday in). They haven&#039;t asked me for verification, but the most I&#039;ve deposited with mtgox was about $215. I don&#039;t want to use them again and then have my funds trapped because I have to wait for them to verify me. Also, does it matter if you use a fake name and birthday for the bitinstant deposit to bitcoin wallets?

				i&#039;ve deposited over 2k USD into mtgox and have not had to verify my account. i did it through bitinstant when they were still doing cash deposits at banks, doing just under 1kUSD at a few different banks.
