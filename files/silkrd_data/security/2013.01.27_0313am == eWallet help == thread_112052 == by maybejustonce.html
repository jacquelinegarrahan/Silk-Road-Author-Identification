				I&#039;m totally new to BTC and all it&#039;s trappings.<br /><br />So lets say I purchase BTC off a vendor on SR... after reading posts saying one shouldn&#039;t keep BTC on SR, I installed Electrum. However, how do I transfer said BTC to my offline wallet? I see like 6 addresses that it came with...<br /><br />Thanks in advance guys.

				go to your SR account, enter the amount you want to transfer. your walled should have some long drawn out code as well that you copy and paste into your SR account and simply click send. If that doesnt make sense lmk and ill go more in depth. i figured it out last night, its really easy. i use blockchain.info

				Well that&#039;s intuitive, but in my ewallet there&#039;s actually 6 addresses...by doing more research I found out that all 6 or so are all valid addresses, but i don&#039;t know how they are consolidated

				The wallet addresses are consolidated in the sense that the bitcoins in them can only be spent with the Electrum wallet installed on your computer (be sure to save that wallet recovery pass phrase!) and your password. But the wonderful thing about bitcoin is that there is no way for anyone else to know any of the addresses are yours or that they are part of the same wallet.<br /><br />After you play around with it a while you&#039;ll notice you always have 5 unused receiving addresses. This is set in the preferences as a &quot;gap limit&quot; (meaning how many unused addresses you have available) so each time you receive coins to one address it will create another unused address so the &quot;gap&quot; is always 5. You can change this number in the preferences. Every time you buy or receive bitcoins you can (and should) use one of the unused addresses.

				maybejustonce, on your receive tab on electrum you can right click and &#039;edit label&#039;. That allows you to have a description on a particular receiving address. For example, if you want to move money from mtgox to your wallet, you might label an address &#039;mtgox&#039; for that purpose. Helps you keep track of where money came from.

Click Account on the top of the page.<br /><br />That takes you to the screen where you can withdraw money. Copy one of your electrum receiving addresses by clicking the receive tab, and right clicking on one of the addresses there. In the pop up menu, select &#039;copy to clipboard&#039;.<br /><br />Back on SR, paste your receiving address into the space provided below &#039;Withdraw bitcoins&#039;. Next to that in the next space provided enter the amount of bitcoins you want to withdraw. In the space after that labeled PIN enter your PIN number. Finally, click the withdraw button. It may take a few hours to appear in your electrum wallet.
