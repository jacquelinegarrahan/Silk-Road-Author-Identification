				I feel UK legislation is putting a tight grip on BTC.&nbsp; We really need a place to update each other and get the best info on cheapest way to get coins.&nbsp; All options are welcome and I personally would appreciate anyone&#039;s views/ help. Thanks. <br /><br />

				ukxbtc is the only vendor Iv ever used. Ive heard good things about BTC4Cash but have never used him. Apparently he doesn&#039;t sell anymore. Was tempted to buy from the user &quot;bitcoins&quot; on the main site as he has pretty good feedback.

				So most UK users of BTC are using this guy?&nbsp; Or getting ripped off by bitbargain although for speed I can&#039;t fault them.&nbsp; Are there any options for SEPA transfers where sure it will take a couple days but pay low transaction costs?&nbsp; I know bitstamp has also closed down as has pingit- blockchain.&nbsp; The lobbying power of banks is incredible in this country.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this has as much to do with drugs as people may think.&nbsp; I think the fact that the oldest monopoly in the world is being opened up and they aren&#039;t happy at the fact it can&#039;t be regulated/ taxed to the hilt.<br /><br />I want anonymous, safe and long lasting way to buy BTC in the UK.&nbsp; Its seems everytime I uncover a new way it is closed within months.&nbsp; I will not pay +$10 mt gox high for more than 1 coin and neither should anyone.&nbsp; I think there is a way that American vendors can stop by and plug this hole, just not sure how yet.<br /><br />So if anyone else can help please reply.&nbsp; Why wait for the other option to close before searching?&nbsp; Stolen accounts/ money laundering will eventually bring attention to 1 bank account.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant but I think there are more options we need to explore.&nbsp;

				I have been considering using a cash-in-post service that is advertised on SR - based in America. The exchange rate losses would not be substantial and postage would, at first glance, be in the region of £10. The seller claims to sell at MTGOX value and has a limited amount of positive feedback for this service, as well as lots of good feedback for his other products (sells weed).<br /><br />I am looking to purchase bitcoins without using my bank account. I find the bitbargain rates quite reasonable (bit high just now with recent slump in BTC value) but don&#039;t want to use bank transfer constantly. I had the following idea, any thoughts?<br /><br />I can go in to a bank and hand over £X and say &quot;I&#039;d like to deposit this in to account number X, sortcode Y&quot; (assuming this is one of the bank&#039;s own customers). Do you think it would be possible for me to open a bitbargain transaction whilst near lots of banks, work out the bank which the seller uses (can be done from sortcode?) and then walk in to a branch of that bank, hand over the amount required in cash and then walk out? Cash deposits are instant when I deposit to my own account so I don&#039;t see why the funds wouldn&#039;t appear in the bitbargain seller&#039;s account immediately also?

				Yes, this is a good way to preserve a degree of anonymity.&nbsp; For the American seller we could use moneygram.&nbsp; I am looking into other options.&nbsp; Would be nice to have 3 or 4 different ways o acquiring coins so as to mix it up.&nbsp; Bitbargain is the only one that seems instant so far.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d be interested in learning more about how state side users could work with overseas users in these types of deals as well. Us is really cracking down on bitcoin exchanges. It won&#039;t be long before all P2P exchanges will be closely monitored as well. I know a guy who does overseas transactions using WU and MG. What are there other options for getting USD from overseas users? I&#039;m learning the overseas market so any info would be greatly appreciated. PM works fine for answers to indulging in public like info.<br />Thanks Guys
