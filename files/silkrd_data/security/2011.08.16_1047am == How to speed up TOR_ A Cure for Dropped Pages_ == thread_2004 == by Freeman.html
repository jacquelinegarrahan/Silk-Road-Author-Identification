				I&#039;ve had a lot of problems with page timeouts.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s better and sometimes it&#039;s worse.&nbsp; In spite of having the fastest residential Internet connection I can get, I spend 2x-3x as much time on SR as is required for my business here due to reloading pages 10 times just to send a message.&nbsp; However, I found this solution and it seems to help quite a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just performed the mod and haven&#039;t had any issues since.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone else.&nbsp; The forum post is dated, so if someone knows a better recent solution, then hit me up.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you use TOR, you probably have experienced slow connections sometimes. Below, I&#039;ll attempt to give instructions to speed up TOR.<br /><br />First thing is you will need to have Vidalia bundle installed. (obviously)<br /><br />Next, double-click the icon for Vidalia Control Panel in your task bar. This should bring up the Vidalia Control Panel<br /><br />Click on &quot;settings&quot; to bring up the settings screen.<br />Click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; button to bring up that tab.<br />Take not of the path to the &quot;Tor Configuration File&quot;.<br />Go to that location and open up the &quot;torrc&quot;.<br /><br />***Alternative to the above instructions***<br />Go to START - PROGRAMS - VIDALIA BUNDLE - TOR - TORRC<br /><br />This will open up the Torrc in notepad.<br /><br />******<br />Make a backup of torrc before editing.<br /><br />After you get the torrc open, at the end of it, paste the following code:<br /><br />Code:<br /># Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the circuit isn&#039;t<br /># open in that time, give up on it. (Default: 1 minute.)<br />CircuitBuildTimeout 5<br /># Send a padding cell every N seconds to keep firewalls from closing our<br /># connections while Tor is not in use.<br />KeepalivePeriod 60<br /># Force Tor to consider whether to build a new circuit every NUM seconds.<br />NewCircuitPeriod 15<br /># How many entry guards should we keep at a time?<br />NumEntryGuards 8<br />Go back to the Vidalia Control Panel from the task bar and click Stop Tor, then Start Tor. This will restart Tor</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />source - http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/proxies/3349-speeding-up-tor.html

				I&#039;m not saying this is a bad idea necessarily, but you should be aware that some of those changes, may reduce your security somewhat. I&#039;m don&#039;t really have the deep technical knowledge required to say exactly how much. But raising the entry guard count for example increases the chance that one of them will be malicious.
