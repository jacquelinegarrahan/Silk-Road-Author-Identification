				Can anyone tell me EXACTLY how to obtain Bitcoins?&nbsp; I&#039;ve downloaded a BitWallet so I am able to generate addresses needed for receiving Bitcoins, however I have no clue how to go about buying them.&nbsp; I put up a post yesterday asking a similar question about what is most reliable to use when purchasing Bitcoins.&nbsp; Most people said Bitinstant.&nbsp; But I have no clue how to go about buying the Bitcoins, I couldn&#039;t figure anything out past downloading the wallet.&nbsp; Some reliable information would be awesome.&nbsp; And, it would be greatly appreciated if you could give me something extremely detailed and explanatory in EVERY tiny little aspect, because I am not very savvy with this!!!&nbsp; Thanks, hopefully someone can help me out

				Bitcoin can seem overwhelming at first, but it&#039;s really simple once you spend a little time with it.<br /><br />I highly recommend going to Bitcopia.com. The site is incredibly easy to use and they accept cash deposits. Just read the section Buying Bitcoins in the FAQ. I think it has instructions there, but it&#039;s so easy, you really probably don&#039;t even need to read it. Just fill out the forms and place your order. Then you make a cash deposit at Wells Fargo for the amount they quote you. Your bitcoins get sent to your wallet address. Voila! <br /><br />They&#039;re only open during banking hours though, so you&#039;ll have to wait til tomorrow. Email the dude if you want. He&#039;s always on top of it.
