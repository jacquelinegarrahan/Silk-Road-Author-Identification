				Sorry if this is an obvious question and sorry if i sound like a cop.<br /><br />I have been hypothetically growing dope for myself for a few years and currently i sell the <br />little i don&#039;t need at a silly price for safety and convenience.&nbsp; I understand that getting <br />to the point where I am a trusted vendor who operates optimally will be necessary before <br />this is an issue - but it would be nice to have some idea how one would turn SR bitcoins <br />into cash. Um, hypothetically.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to buy any proper drugs with the bitcoins mainly because selling them seems <br />the least secure thing to do with ones hypothetical time. I&#039;m looking for the least risky <br />and most latent kind of ways that people have heard about people using successfully.<br /><br />I am in the UK. Hypothetically.

				This will leave you with &#039;clean&#039; coins in the sense that they can&#039;t be linked to drugs trade. These are not coins that are &#039;washed&#039;, so if the amounts are large enough (depending on different laws, etc), you&#039;ll have to explain your earnings to the IRS/HMRC/tax dude. This can become kinda tricky (although buying and selling BTC would be a pretty good cover). Anyone got some info on how they handle that?

				Ha! At least i don&#039;t have a crackhead partner ;D<br /><br />Mainly I was wondering if there was an easy way to use the coins to pay for groceries etc and it seems if i research the methods described I would be able to. Many thanks for the detailed replies so far - anyone with any other ideas or tips are always welcome :)<br /><br />Seems i have a lot to learn and will get Toring - thanks again Silk Road.

				Ah, i see - thank you &lt;3.&nbsp; Sorry for all my questions, I am rather new to all of this.<br /><br />I guess I was foolish to think it would be possible to turn bitcoins into cash money without using a bank account! I would be too wary of the taxman to have money coming into my bank account since I would have no way to explain it.<br /><br />Is it possible to BT to prepaid anonymous cards one could pay for stuff with? I would assume not.<br /><br />What methods are there to turn bitcoins into cash without using a bank account? Do people sell gold on SR?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				there is many emoneys which been around much longer then bitcoins and many services which offers debit cards to get cash out for those emoney and commission quite low. going that route you, will clean bitcoins same time as you will be cashing liberty for example. and it is &quot;type and go to ATM&quot; operation, with no waiting for bank transfers and cash in envelope.

				I have to disagree with resellers method although it&#039;s good it&#039;s too lengthy.<br /><br />Get an LR account.<br /><br />Withdraw bitcoins from SilkRoad to your own wallet or if your paranoid another wallet on a virtual machine, generate new bitcoin address for every transaction.<br /><br />Then exchange coins to LR.<br /><br />Then exchange LR to VCC.<br /><br />Then buy stuff online for yourself OR buy then sell the stuff and maybe even make a profit with ebay selling or whatever.

				Oops, I just made a thread but after reading every post this is the same topic:<br /><br />&#039;&#039;I opened this thread not for free advice but because everybody who has BTC has the opportunity to get taxfree income but how is this possible in a brilliant way? I was thinking to apply for a prepaid debit or creditcard service and use an ATM to withdraw everything after selling the BTC for a low fee. Of course google came right up with some services but is there anyone who want to discuss this or has any idea, using bank transfer will make you pay taxes in a way after a few years 100%. Please share. &#039;&#039;<br /><br />I came across bitcoin debit card from panama city which is very interesting but not this part: &#039;&#039;In order to comply with the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism legislation, including the Know Your Customer (KYC) rules we are required to ask for copys of identification documents. &#039;&#039;<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep looking...<br />

				Another idea, but maybe one that&#039;s more for the future:<br /><br />You are your own currency exchange now. Sell Bitcoins to people for cash, in person. Once Silk Road gets more widely known, there may suddenly be a lot more willing f2f buyers than you would have thought...

				so.... i get my btc&#039;s through intersango.... in order to fill my intersango account, i have to finance with dwolla.... it&#039;s cheap and it&#039;s safe, but the problem has always been time.... from dwolla to btc&#039;s in my SR account it takes about five days.... the other day, as i was preparing to deposit into my dwolla account, i noticed an option to fill my account instantly.... shit, who wouldn&#039;t want that, right??? time saved, main problem solved.... well, i went through their application process and was approved for their little &#039;credit check&#039;... well it didn&#039;t occur to me until just now that dwolla now has my social security number.... can my btc&#039;s be tracked back to me if something happens on the sellers end and they find those btc&#039;s in his account.... do they have my information on them??? is their any way to launder them that is safe and quick???? i kinda feel like i&#039;ve been suckered and this instant access to funds was just a ploy to get my social security number.... anybody have any comments or suggestions???

				As far as online wallet providers go, it has to be the blockchain.info wallet service<br /><br />Main benefits imo:<br /><br />-no e-mail or details required to sign up<br />-2 factor authentication (including using hardware Yubikeys)<br />-Android and iOS apps<br /><br />Very impressive security features
