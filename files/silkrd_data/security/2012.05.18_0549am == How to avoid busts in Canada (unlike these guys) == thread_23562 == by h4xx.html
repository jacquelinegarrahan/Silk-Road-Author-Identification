				I didn&#039;t see this posted anywhere so here goes<br />http://www.leaderpost.com/news/Postal+workers+find+accidentally+opened+package+heading+Saskatoon/6637831/story.html<br /><br />What they did wrong:<br />==============<br /><br />&nbsp;8) didn&#039;t communicate with each other what the pkg looked like.<br />Cops repackaged the drugs for delivery. Know what kind of packaging your vendor uses so if it shows up as a cardboard plain box and he says he shipped it as a laptop box uhh yeah.<br /><br />&nbsp;8) terribad stealth<br />Package supposedly fell apart and they found the weed. Should&#039;ve put the vac sealed weed bags in hard tupperware or something strong and then wrap that again in paper, then use a good box and seal the fuck out of it. If somebody ever opens your package they shouldn&#039;t be able to obviously find any drugs. Packages get crushed and accidentally opened all the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;8) cops put alarm in package<br />Follow the rule of writing RTS and crossing out the address then leaving it for a few days. At least if you open it and they bust in while you&#039;re writing RTS you have some sort of legal ground to stand on<br /><br />&nbsp;8) don&#039;t sign for anything ever<br />Dude was clueless and signed for it when they should&#039;ve prearranged (vendor and customer) that nothing should be signed for.<br /><br />&nbsp;8) dude had the tracking left on his screen indicating he was waiting for the pkg.<br />Probably not encrypted either, probably using his real IP to check the number, srsly wtf<br /><br />&nbsp;8) cops have surveillance vid of buddy mailing the pkg<br />Don&#039;t go into the post office this is why. PRINT the labels online and mail. This is what virtual credit cards and socks5 proxies are for. <br /><br />&nbsp;8) talked to the cops without a lawyer, admitted everything<br />Get a lawyer never say anything to the police ever, even if they promise to let you go (they won&#039;t). Don&#039;t rat your associates do your own time. They had some girl at DHL at a local airport here on camera placing a bunch of coke in the post customs clearance area&nbsp; and she walked because she didn&#039;t talk to the cops: <br />http://www.leaderpost.com/news/Courier+found+guilty+exporting+cocaine/6618965/story.html<br /><br />

				Here&#039;s a guy who got 7yrs (though in Canada, you only serve 1/4 of your sentence before parole usually)<br />http://www.leaderpost.com/news/Duncan+gets+years+cocaine+trafficking/6607490/story.html<br /><br />What he did wrong:<br />-Didn&#039;t use PGP cops had all his communications<br />-Imported a stupid amount of cocaine the cops found all in one package<br />-Continued to traffic even though he was under investigation<br /><br />&nbsp;:( :( :( :(<br /><br />Here&#039;s a group of major traffickers that all walked because cops fucked up the case. Again, get a lawyer.<br />http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/07/30/rights-violated-in-b-c-ecstasy-case-judge-says/<br /><br />Lol they are suing the cops now. Awesome<br /><br /><br />

				Nazi Canada federal government just changed the laws to include mandatory US style sentencing for drugs, though judges may disregard their legislation. Even still you just have to worry about shipping to the US as they extradite every single time. Shipping from Canada kilos of MDMA to UK and you&#039;d probably get 2-4yrs, maybe serve a year if that and be out.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t rat to save your ass. It&#039;s very easy in Canada for a disgruntled associate of yours to pay to have you &#039;hot buttered&#039; in prison here. If you don&#039;t know what that is basically an inmate boils margarine in the microwave (yeah, they give prisoners microwaves) and dumps in jam so it has the consistency of sticky napalm. Dude will take a bucket of this boiling shit and throw it on your face in chow hall then around 5 guys jump you and beat you half to death. Never, never rat. If you must plead guilty don&#039;t take anybody with you.<br /><br />The last guy to do this was given a paltry 12mos added to his sentence and the guy he dumped it on has disfiguring for life second degree burns so they don&#039;t give a fuck and will do it for like $1,000 worth of commissary cash. It was over some bullshit petty street feud. Canada prisons aren&#039;t as crazy as the US but you can still get totally fucked up in one. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
