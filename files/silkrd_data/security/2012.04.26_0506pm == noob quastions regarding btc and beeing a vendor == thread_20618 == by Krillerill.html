				Hi <br />im new and want to learn more, i also have learning disability so reading thru alot of text to find one specific fact is almost impossible for me :&#039;(<br />but im willing to try.<br />where might i find more information regarding my specific questions? <br /><br />1, searched but haven&#039;t found one yet. - vendor/seller guide that especially empathizes how to get money out -safely with as little fees as possible(not laundry) <br />2, what are good ways to laundry money? of-course respect that it might be trade secrets.<br />3, is BTC &quot;tagged&quot; / traceable - first i thought it wasn&#039;t - but seeing guides/people wonder - how to buy it anonymously makes me question that <br />4, if tagged, how do i scramble it?<br />5, at what amounts does money needs to be laundered to not raise questions at the bank? i mean amounts in 1000-4000€/year could be explained by online gambling, right?&nbsp;

				1. This is actually quite a hot topic. I offer a service on Silk Road itself (link below) offering cash in the mail in exchange for Bitcoins. There&#039;s also the website Coinabul which offers gold/silver bars in exchange for Bitcoins. Finally you can sell the BTC and transfer the funds to your bank account although this isn&#039;t as anonymous. Interesango will withdraw funds to UK/European accounts.<br /><br />2. Several sellers (myself included!) offer ways to launder money. If you want to do it with Bitcoins you can use a mixing service like Bitcoin Fog but this won&#039;t necessarily stop law enforcement and banks noticing all the money appearing in your bank account.<br /><br />3. If a BTC address is linked to someone&#039;s identity then all coins sent to or from that address can be traced. The weak points are when people are buying coins using a traceable method e.g bank transfer and/or trying to withdraw them.<br /><br />4. See answers to point 1 &amp; 2 above.<br /><br />5. The heuristic algorithms used by banks monitoring software aren&#039;t just to do with amounts but I&#039;d recommend keeping it down to three figures i.e less than 1000 Euros. Also try to find a way to withdraw funds that doesn&#039;t involve your bank account as outlined above. You will pay more for doing this but it&#039;s safer.<br /><br />It is going to cost you money to launder your Bitcoins/Cash no matter which method you choose. I am currently offering an investment opportunity for people where I launder their Bitcoins but I return the investment in BTC as it&#039;s safer for them. I would have no problem sending cash in the mail though if this would help.<br /><br />Let me know if there&#039;s anything else you&#039;d like to know.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20618.msg209069#msg209069">Quote from: Krillerill on April 26, 2012, 05:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi <br />im new and want to learn more, i also have learning disability so reading thru alot of text to find one specific fact is almost impossible for me :&#039;(<br />but im willing to try.<br />where might i find more information regarding my specific questions? <br /><br />1, searched but haven&#039;t found one yet. - vendor/seller guide that especially empathizes how to get money out -safely with as little fees as possible(not laundry) <br />2, what are good ways to laundry money? of-course respect that it might be trade secrets.<br />3, is BTC &quot;tagged&quot; / traceable - first i thought it wasn&#039;t - but seeing guides/people wonder - how to buy it anonymously makes me question that <br />4, if tagged, how do i scramble it?<br />5, at what amounts does money needs to be laundered to not raise questions at the bank? i mean amounts in 1000-4000€/year could be explained by online gambling, right? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
