				you are not alone, even though I had already realized that I don&#039;t know the PIN, I still sent money to the account because I thought that I can at least buy something... nada :(<br />In my case &quot;only&quot; 30 BTCs are lost, but I pity those who have lots of BTCs frozen now.

				This was the message, btw:<br /><br />From: SR Support<br /><br />DO NOT DELETE THIS MESSAGE: PIN RESET<br /><br />Your PIN has been reset due to too many failed attempts. Please reply to this message in seven days for a new PIN. If you did not forget your PIN, your account may have been compromised and you should contact support asap. Do NOT delete this message. Doing so will delay receipt of your new PIN.

				I&#039;ve only been on SR for a couple months, and have no recollection of setting a PIN. Anytime I am asked for &#039;PIN&#039;, I use a specific four digit code I associate with TOR services and keep stored in an encrypted folder.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I see it is sometimes referred to as a 2ndary or backup password.&nbsp; Tried every password and passphrase in my encrypted folder, nothing.&nbsp; I am almost positive Buyers never had to set a PIN without withdrawing funds or establishing a backup address.<br /><br />If the exchange rate drops even a tenth of a btc while I&#039;m waiting for this issue to be resolved, I am going to demand that SR pay the balance. That&#039;s not being rude, only fair.

				I have had the same problem, contacted support, and they reset the PIN in about 12 hours ( I am in a different timezone).<br /><br />The PIN is the same as the &quot;second&quot; or &quot;withdrawal&quot; password, so it can consist of any alphanumeric string (letters and digits).<br />The reaction of the support team might also depend upon the circumstances, in my case it was quite clear, I sent BTCs, wanted to spend them immediatel, but could not because I didn&#039;t know my PIN, contacted support immediately.<br />If you already have a lot of BTCs in your account it will probably be harder, after all, this is to protect you from the &quot;bad people&quot; out there trying to get to your BTCs....<br /><br /><br />Anyway, thx to the RC team, I don&#039;t have to spend a week without some &quot;relaxation&quot; ;)<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />Stephe

				Thanks Psilocin -- yes the email I got this morning from them said they reset my PIN. I used that link you provded and its telling me I have a PIN already?? Is this the case where I must wait the 7 days now? This is so confusing and the emails back from SR are one sentence answers that arent really dealing with the issue -- they just keep saying -- &quot;PIN reset&quot;. Based off some other posts besides this one it appears many people are confused on this - I wish it was clearer as this cant be that difficult. If anyone else has gotten any messages from SR that are similar and you have had to go through this can you please explain how you picked out a new PIN if you did not know your old one or if you kept getting the same message -- &quot;you already have a PIN&quot;....many thanks to all - MYB

				He is not locked out of SR, he just can&#039;t withdraw or buy anything without his PIN (aka &quot;Withdrawal Password&quot; or &quot;Second Password&quot;).<br />The term &quot;PIN&quot; is a bit misleading as most users regasrd a PIN as a 3 or 4 digit code, while it is in fact an alphanumeric string here.

				Might as well be locked out... You can browse but can&#039;t purchase or withdraw your funds.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I have messaged SR Support, this is the 8th day, going to the 9th and still haven&#039;t had my pin reset.&nbsp; <br /><br />The message(s) regarding PIN reset are still in my inbox.<br /><br />Still awaiting acknowledgement.

				If anyone is able to successfully retrieve their &quot;reset pin&quot; could you please let us know how tedious the process was and how long it ultimately took? I&#039;ve been waiting 8 days and haven&#039;t heard anything back from SR despite multiple messages.

				I&#039;m in the same boat, 1st experience with SR, i managed to get BTC into my account in record time and just about to purchase something specific, i forget my pin. I managed to lock my account&nbsp; and then i remember what my pin was? Hows your luck, hey.<br /><br />Problem being that if i wait 7 days then the chances of this product still being available is slim and i might loose value in the BTC i have sitting doormant in my account.<br /><br />Not the best 1st experience with SR

				I do vaguely remember setting a PIN / second password a while back... I just tried every password that I know and I&#039;ve successfully locked myself out&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I&#039;ve sent the admins a message; hopefully they can help get me sorted quicker than 7 days!<br /><br />I really don&#039;t understand how having two passwords is any more secure than having one. If a hacker has my first password (via keylogger, for instance), they have my second one too.

				This is absolutely ridiculous.&nbsp; I am able to deposit money still yet make no purchases or withdraw.&nbsp; Because we all know hackers and such routinely put money INTO peoples&#039; accounts, right?<br /><br />I never even had a shot at guessing my pin.&nbsp; For one, the implementation was horrendous.&nbsp; I randomly log in one time and it asks for me to create a pin that I&#039;ll need later.&nbsp; Then weeks later when asked for a pin, I type in the usual 4 digit pins I would use.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, that&#039;s right they don&#039;t want what every single other person on the planet would imagine as a pin (4 digits or so), it&#039;s just a second password.&nbsp; How many people go to the ATM and try to type in &quot;qwerty123&quot; to see if passwords and pins are interchangeable?&nbsp; Avoid the confusion and call it a second password.&nbsp; Pin has and always will imply numeric digits.&nbsp; <br /><br />So now that I&#039;ve been fucked out of taking money out of my account but allowed to put money IN, I have bitcoins in limbo for at least a week.&nbsp; Not only will I take a huge loss as BTCs decline in value over that time, but I also may very likely experience withdrawal symptoms because I&#039;ll now be going a week without.<br /><br />I&#039;ve poured thousands of dollars&nbsp; through this site and lined SR&#039;s pockets with cash, and now for my loyalty I&#039;m thrown under a bus for a week to deal with withdrawals.&nbsp; You turned on the members that made your site relevant and successful in the first place.<br /><br />EDITS

				Since SilkRoad allows hedging of bitcoins while in transit, why not hedge frozen funds to the USD amount they had when they were frozen as soon as they are able to have their pin reset?<br /><br />Can this be done for me, at least?&nbsp; If I can&#039;t spend my BTC I deposited can I at least not have a depreciated balance when I can spend them?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll just go to sleep and then fuck off for a few weeks while SR finishes counting their money.&nbsp; Maybe then they will permit me to use the BTCs they so graciously let me deposit.&nbsp; If there were a marketplace comparable in size to SR so much of this BS would not fly with the userbase.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;State of the Road&quot; raising fees?&nbsp; Insane security measures that mean nothing?&nbsp; Why would the hacker give up after 7 days and not proceed with resetting the pin?&nbsp; Time isn&#039;t really a factor, if someone is legitimately locked out of their account they will be locked out for as long as the hacker keeps the password changed.<br /><br />Give it a few months before it&#039;s like Paypal and every purchase results in a chargeback and your account is opened and closed at their every whim.

				I too experienced the dreaded PIN lockout.&nbsp; A polite message to the SR support team explaining when I joined I did not remember setting a PIN and I exhausted all of my passwords (I use less than 5 so it boggled me that none worked).&nbsp; Within 24 hours they had reset my PIN.&nbsp; <br />Maybe it was the date I joined (early November), the fact I had just deposited my first bitcoins 30 minutes prior to being locked out or maybe it was because I showed some manners and remained calm.&nbsp; <br />Thanks SR support!
