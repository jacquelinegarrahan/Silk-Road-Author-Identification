				I have another forum ID but created this ID so I could post this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />To me paranoia is when you think people are out to get you BUT when you engage in illegal activities people really will be out to<br />get you.<br /><br />Weird shit happens to us all, Im aware of that, but when weird shit seems to be happening all the time, for me it is just to much<br />of a coincidence.<br /><br />I am writing this without anything in my system so I cant blame it on drug induced paranoia.<br /><br />I was awaiting an order arriving and it was taking longer than expected to arrive, so I looked on the forums and there was a thread<br />relating to the vendor containing other people with the same problem.&nbsp; I made a post stating that I had not had delivery yet.&nbsp; The<br />very next morning it arrived.&nbsp; I analysed the situation and came up with this - vendor compromised by LE, LE seize the vendors<br />packages, we all know LE monitor the forums so they wait until a thread appears with people complaining about not receiving, they<br />then send the packages, people with no sense go back to thread and post now received, LE are able to link forum ID&#039;s with real life<br />names and addresses.&nbsp; Slight paranoia granted but still possible?&nbsp; Also there did not appear to be any problems with this vendor<br />until around the time I ordered - coincidence?&nbsp; Around this time there was another vendor I ordered from who also seemed to go <br />scammer when I placed an order - coincidence again?&nbsp; Paranoia - Im so important the world revolves around me etc etc?&nbsp; Just find<br />it strange I send my details and they go scam.<br /><br />Next up I called to see an associate, while there they showed me their latest product, something that is unusual in itself.&nbsp; Anyway,<br />the product looked very similar to 1 available on SR.&nbsp; Were they letting me know subtly that they were aware of SR?&nbsp; Were they subtly<br />making me aware that they knew I bought from here?&nbsp; I am aware that vendors can see buyer stats but do these stats show what product<br />was purchased and from whom?&nbsp; The way I see it say for the sake of argument all of a sudden an area is flooded with a certain type <br />of Ecstacy that can be traced back to SR, LE or adversaries with a vendor account can quickly check up to see what users has purchased large <br />quantities of this Ecstacy and identify the people IRL.<br /><br />Next up was a coldcall at the front door.&nbsp; The person claimed to be from a certain internet company.&nbsp; The person wanted to know how<br />at present I obtained the service which they offered, as I currently receive the service offered illegally I told them I didnt have this<br />service and would be interested. However, when they tried to enter my details into the iPad they had with them they told me they were <br />unable to connect to the internet and could they connect to mine which would require giving them my password.&nbsp; At this stage I really<br />suspicious, suspecting undercover LE, but not wanting to appear like I had anything to hide I gave the password (which was changed the second<br />they left).&nbsp; As I gave my details I could see where they were going - my bank details would be required, so at this point I informed them<br />that due to concerns about keylogging programs etc I would not be proceeding.&nbsp; I then looked at the photo on their ID card, it looked nothing<br />them and pointed this out to them, to which they proceeded to produce their driving licence, which once again looked nothing like them, again<br />I pointed this out and they proceeded to leave pretty quickly.&nbsp; I noticed they just left my street without approaching any other houses, but<br />realise this could have been down to their experience with me.&nbsp; Just strange all round.<br /><br />Next up, while checking my clearnet email I noticed an email from a certain delivery company (I will send a copy of this by way of PM) telling<br />me that the details I had gave were wrong and that they were unable to deliver.&nbsp; There were a few problems with this - wrong country being 1.<br />Their website seemed legit when I checked it out but with the email there were attatchments available to download (which I didnt download), I also<br />didnt reply.&nbsp; But how did this company get my email address?&nbsp; Who gave them it? Trap?<br /><br />Finally, for the first time I decided to use a domestic vendor.&nbsp; They didnt have a PGP key so info was sent by privnote.&nbsp; Before I ordered<br />did the usual - read as much as was possible about them etc and they seemed OK.&nbsp; I order and since ordering they have not appeared, so it became<br />to cancel, which I did, but what happens to the privnote?&nbsp; Will this vendor be in receipt of my uncrpyted details?&nbsp; But once again it would appear<br />a vendor disappears once I deal with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not Tony Montona, I am but just a small cog in a couple of wheels, SR being one and a couple of others in real life. But to break the <br />wheels, so to speak, they take out a few of the cogs?<br /><br />The security I take with regard to SR is that I have tor and PGP on an encrpyted USB. <br /><br />I would be very interested in people&#039;s opinions on all the above.&nbsp; I find if 1 person agrees/disagrees with you possibly they may have a point,<br />but if lots of people have the same opinion on something you say chances are they are right. <br />

				I feel like the majority of people feel LE has an unlimited budget and is far more capable than they actually are. Unless it&#039;s a threat to national security or major trafficking, you&#039;re going to be disappointed to find their pretty straightforward and predictable in their pursuits of petty drug charges.

				You see weird things everywhere, if you look. Today, on my way to work, I saw a man, dressed all in white, standing in a pine tree. I&#039;m totally serious. Why the fuck he was up there, or what the fuck he was doing, I&#039;ve no idea. But it had nothing to do with me. But what if I happened to live in the house next to the tree, and had just got an order from SR? The exact same situation would have gone from, &quot;Well, that&#039;s sure weird&quot; to, &quot;Holy fucking fuck, I better burn all the evidence now!!&quot;<br /><br />That said, the situation with the iPad does seem pretty sketch. Maybe just some neighbor trying to get your wireless password for personal use? Who knows.

				I&#039;d say everything up to the cold call was innocuous and sounds like excessive paranoia on your part. The cold call sounds like a scammer attempting to social engineer your info. This guy claimed to rep an internet company and couldn&#039;t even get online himself? What a putz. <br /><br />As far as clearnet delivery company, need more info on that. What did you order? How&#039;d they get the address wrong? Did you check out domain records on the company and research it? How&#039;d they get your email address? Did you provide it when you ordered the stuff they&#039;re trying to deliver? There&#039;s just not enough info to go off of to know whether you&#039;re sketching or not.

				The lesson to take from this is that if you try to not act suspicious to LE by telling them to fuck off, you may end up giving them your passwords lol. You sound like you have been using ketamine a lot to me ;). If LE knows you and they want you they will just kick your door down.

				OP, you&#039;re talking about &quot;reich&quot; ? I saw his thread about Royal Mail yesterday. But I can&#039;t find it anymore. <br /><br />He said something like all his orders didn&#039;t arrived, what is very unusual. I have ordered something from him, like two weeks ago. He sent out my order on the same day with another vendor from UK.<br /><br />I have received the package from the other vendor from UK in under a week, as expected. I&#039;m still waiting for the order from reich. It is now nearly a week too late. It was only personal amount, so i&#039;m not really concerned about this.<br /><br />The packages should be probably of the same size, nothing special. So I don&#039;t think it has something to do with that smaller packages were shipped faster or something.<br /><br />It seems very strange, since they both are from UK and sent the packages on the same day out.<br /><br />So either he gone scam, what would make no sense at all.<br /><br />Or some serious shit is going on. <br /><br />If the package should arrive in the next days, what should I do with it? I think it was sent unregistered so I don&#039;t have to sign for it. Of course I would not do it if I had to. But what if they just put the package in my mailbox since it was unregistered?

				Please learn to use your enter key properly.<br /><br />You&#039;re probably just being paranoid, the delivery company/guy at the door sounded suspicious but I don&#039;t think they&#039;re related to SR and Privnote at all.

				Paranoia has a way of multiplying due to your own guilt. Our guilt makes us feel like everyone around us knows what we are doing or are going to do... that cop behind you hasn&#039;t a clue about that baggie in your pocket but the internal guilt makes you over compensate.. slowing down, speeding up, changing lanes erratically, your not avoiding the cop as he truly has no clue about your crime... it is your subconscious guilt that gives you away. When you are doing something illegal and you have covered all your bases then most likely it is just your overactive imagination that is getting the better of you... use the Occam&#039;s Razor Law in most situations, that being: the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.<br /><br />Here is a little story about overactive paranoia and how it gets the best of us sometimes. (100% true story)<br />As most of you know I am a weed dealer on SR so I am usually in possession of felony amounts of bud. I live in a rural area with houses around me but it is also in kind of a dead end area. In other words NO ONE parks on my road if they don&#039;t live there. I had just received a large shipment the day before so I was on my toes and being extra watchful. I noticed a dark SUV parked near my house but on another road kind of catty corner to wear I live. I could see someone sitting in the car, they sat there for like a half hour... my paranoia was building so I got in my car and acting like I was going out I drove by the SUV slowly and got a good look at the driver... a white male, early 40&#039;s kinda scrunched down on a cell phone. When I got to the end of the road I hung a left and right there is a Postal Van parked with blinkers on and the guy driving the truck was not any of the postal employees I know (I know ALL the ones that drive my area) to make matters worse the guy was on a cell and when he saw me he stared real hard at me... my mind is racing now, dreaming up all kinds of scenarios... is the guy in the SUV watching me and coordinating with the strange postal van around the corner? I drove around for about an hour then came back and both were gone... the next 24 hours I am cleaning my stash house out... moving stuff around,...etc..<br />So the next day I look out my window and there is the SUV again parked at the same spot with the driver watching me... or so I thought... 20 minutes later about the same time I drove off the previous day a school bus pulled up and dropped some kids off and they got in the SUV and drove off towards the development behind me....<br /><br />The lesson is paranoia can cause you to take one event and make further future events that have no relation to each other seem like they are related. <br /><br />Good luck and chill out... if you look at these events separately and logically you will most likely see they are just random occurrences...<br /><br />TJ<br />

				Since there seems to be a lot of outrageous conspiracy claims lately, I think it&#039;s time we had a little chat about logic.<br /><br />In order to assert a claim, you must have some evidence to back it.&nbsp; If your claim has no evidence, then it can be dismissed on the grounds it lacks evidence.&nbsp; To do otherwise is to entertain every crazy idea that enters you head, which can be fun, but it doesn&#039;t always help your sanity.<br /><br />When making your claim, make as few assumptions as possible.&nbsp; The less you assume, the greater chance you have of being correct.<br /><br />While we are in a dangerous field that requires extra caution, we must be wary of outrageous paranoia.&nbsp; Paranoia is bad for our health, and it&#039;s a crippling force.&nbsp; Please consider this the next time you post grandoise claims like this.
