				your fine, instawallet takes 2 confirmations in order for coins to actually be in the account, just save the link and go back to it after 2 confirmations and the coins will be there, instawallet is a great service

Here is the kicker, now my coins are gone!&nbsp; Has this happened to anyone else?&nbsp; Do I have any recourse? I can prove via mt gox the transfer was made into instawalltet.&nbsp; What can I do? I am freaking out cause I have everything I need to get my shop up and running.&nbsp; Please help if possible.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope you didnt lose your money but I know that I have had alot of trouble with money I sent to wallets just disappearing. If the problem is with MTGox you will def get your coin. But I downloaded several different wallets and I had problems with coins sent disappearing.

				I think might be screwed because I did the transfer in Chromes incognito window and only copied the actual wallet and the URL but I never closed it (incognito) and was able to go back to a URL that points to the wallet I copied so maybe I am good? But my coins are still not showing. I am tweaking out.&nbsp; Mt Gox shows them gone and trasferred to the wallet addy they were there but now they are not.&nbsp; Just checked SR and they didnt get there ether.
