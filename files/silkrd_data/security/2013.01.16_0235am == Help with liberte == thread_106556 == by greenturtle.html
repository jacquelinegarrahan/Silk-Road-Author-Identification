				Hi,<br /><br />I have formated my USB, and everything. Now how do I do step 2, I mean how do I know im extracting it to the root?<br /><br />2. Install Liberte to USB<br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as<br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.<br /><br />Next question is, once I change my boot order and set the USB drive on top will my computer boot up normaly without the USB present?<br /><br /><br />Next, how do I get kleopatra, and a few other documents off my computer and onto my USB? Do I do that after I get it all set up, or do I need new files once I have my live usb set up?<br /><br />Thanks for the help guys,<br />Greenturtle

				Your pc might not always boot correctly with usb first.<br />With some drives/sticks it won&#039;t boot, it just hangs. But then you can just easily power off/take out the usb drive, start pc and put the device back in...

				Ok, I got the liberte working good yesterday. I figured out the pgp program on there, its really nice, I like it better than kleopatra.<br /><br />Now I am having a problem. Everytime I type my internet password and hit enter my computer freezes, anyone know a fix?<br /><br />This is like an emergency, all I got is my phone for now.<br /><br />Thanks for the help,<br />Greenturtle
