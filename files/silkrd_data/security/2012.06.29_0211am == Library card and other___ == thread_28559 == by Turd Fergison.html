				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this, so would greatly appreciate some guidance.<br /><br />I went to the public library and got an MT GOX account.&nbsp; They required my ID to use the PC.&nbsp; Is that a security problem?&nbsp; Should I try again at a different location like a bookstore or internet cafe?<br />Should I close the temporary email account setup to receive the account number?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m a bit confused as to how to get bitcoins and make payments.<br />1) Do I just use moneygram to send cash to bitinstant.com, then get online and transfer from bitinstant to my MTGOX account?&nbsp; <br /><br />2) How do I then transfer it to SR?&nbsp; Should I bounce it around a few times first?&nbsp; If so, how?<br /><br />3) When placing an order, how do I get my shipping address to the sender securely?<br /><br />4) Should any of the above steps be done on a public access PC (eg. library), or is the home PC on Tor okay?<br /><br />4) I&#039;ve heard rumors of problems with tormail...do you need tormail to make a purchase?<br /><br />Many, MANY Thanks!!!!

				Actually you don&#039;t need an account anywhere at all. Just start Tor and buy drugs. Most people here are just paranoid fucks. You don&#039;t need hide in the library if you want to buy some drugs for personal use. You only should give a fuck if you want to start vending or for buying bulk amounts.<br /><br />1. Use the &quot;Pay from&quot; method of your choice and use &quot;Pay to&quot; -&gt; Bitcoin to email. You will get an email from bitinstant in an hour with a link to another website where you just provide an bitcoin address and you will get your bitcoins tranfered to this address. For example, you can use a bitchain wallet address to receive the money, without using a bitcoin client on your computer. Use Tor for this process.<br /><br />2. SR has an own &quot;bouncing&quot; service, if you buy personal amounts, don&#039;t give a fuck. Just send&nbsp; it directly from your bitchain wallet to your SR address.<br /><br />3. You import the PGP key from the vendor and encrypt your address with this key. Post your encrypted name in the field where you should post your name. If the vendor doesn&#039;t use PGP, look for another vendor.<br /><br />4. Home with Tor is pretty fine.<br /><br />5. There are no problems. Only a domain change. You don&#039;t need it, but its a good choice to use it for sites like bitinstant.
