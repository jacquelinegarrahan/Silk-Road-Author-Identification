				While this is a fairly beginner thing, I haven&#039;t seen any security guides mention this. <br />A file on your HDD exists as two components; the file itself, and a pointer showing where the file is located. When you delete a file, you&#039;re not actually erasing it, you&#039;re just erasing the pointer. The data still exists, and could be obtained fairly easily with a data recovery program. So, if you&#039;re going to delete a file, overwrite it with a bigger, nonincriminating file first. Same goes for formatting.

				I hope this isn&#039;t news to anyone and I don&#039;t think it is. And you shouldn&#039;t over write with a bigger file you should wipe it according to DoD standards with CCleaner. Everyone uses CCleaner. Writing a bigger file over one you deleted will still show a shadow of the former file, you need to overwrite it at least 3 times for secure deletion.

				I&#039;ve used another program called &quot;Eraser&quot; as well, to wipe individual files. Trouble is, who knows where additional copies of files&nbsp; in windows end up as you access and use them. I feel much better now that I am using Tails.<br /><br />After I started using Tails, I actually ended up going back and wiping my hard drive completely with a program called &quot;Dban&quot;, and re-installing Windows, and bringing everything back up to date. Was a pain in the ass, and probably overkill, but I wanted to be sure I didn&#039;t leave anything incriminating anywhere on the hard drive. <br /><br />Computer was having some performance problems for a while anyway, it works generally much better now.

				RAM disks baby... don&#039;t save stuff to disk that is incriminating in the first place.&nbsp; Just make sure you power off your machine for a few minutes every day.

				Alright, glad to know that you don&#039;t see this in any guides because everyone takes it for granted, not because it&#039;s advanced. I like to fancy myself as moderately good with computers, and I didn&#039;t learn about this until fairly recently, and I thought it might be helpful for people to know during the mass file deletion following Freedom Hosting&#039;s collapse. <br /><br />So what&#039;s the problem with owerwritten files casting a shadow? For all LE would know, it could be any file was overwritten. Besides that, even if they had reason to believe it was something criminal, an overwritten isn&#039;t solid evidence for them. <br /><br /><br />Also, is keeping stuff on flash drives secure? I imagine you would only need to delete files once, as solid state is much less persistent than disks. Besides that, they can be destroyed and disposed very easily and stealthily.
