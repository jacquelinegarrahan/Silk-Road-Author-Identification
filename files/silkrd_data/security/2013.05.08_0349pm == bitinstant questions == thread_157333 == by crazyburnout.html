				okay 2 questions on bitinstant. 1 for their deposit to wallet address option. do they convert the money into coins to send to the address? i mean i dont need to get the money on mtgox and buy coins? and 2 do they ever ask to see ID when youmake the cash deposit? would it be safe to give them a fake name?

				Yes they will convert into BTC, so no need to visit mtgox. As for ID, different stores have different policies, it&#039;s been said that Walmart is the easiest on this as long as its under $800.<br /><br />Yesterday I did a payment using all fake info and the person asked for my ID, I told them that I was doing this to help my in need cousin out, so they just said &#039;Don&#039;t worry about it&quot;. <br /><br />Think about it, 90% of the time you use Western Union of some quick payment system, it&#039;s to bail out a deadbeat relative, so it makes complete sense info and ID don&#039;t match.<br /><br />Just rotate your deposit locations and it should never be an issue.

				I was just about to bring up this very issue. Thanks for posting it first OP :)<br /><br />Wal-Mart is the best choice because they don&#039;t seem to require ID at all. CVS always checks ID in my area, and it&#039;s been getting tough to avoid. It really depends on who&#039;s working and how desperate you sound. lol<br /><br />Has anyone tried 7-11 or any of the other moneygram locations? They would all be closer to me than wal-mart. If I can get a confirmation that one of them doesn&#039;t require ID, that would be awesome.
