Just like USD can go up or down, so do bitcoins, just with more intensity. Clearly they are dropping atm, and so your $$ will decrease accordingly.

				I never ever ever leave any available BTC in my account... <br /><br />Because you never know when a cent or two are gonna go missing...(not due to fluctuation!!)<br /><br />If you move them out right away or use them right away then you don&#039;t need to worry about that and I think that&#039;s the smart way to go!

In December the maximum amount of btc per minute produced will get cut in half...<br /><br />this means the price will rise because now only half the amount could be mined&nbsp; per day as compared to today!!<br /><br />So really its going to go up.... add to that all the newbies who saw this place on the news a month ago, and are soon going to get there first package... once that happens and they tell there friends and it being the holidays and with all that extra bonus cash and all the parties, people will be buying more btc to buy drugs for the holidays.. which will also bring a rise in the btc... I expect it to hit between 15-20 bucks in December!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What? I&#039;ve read about the total limit cap of btc, but i haven&#039;t heard about the ammount able to be mined per hour being capped. Please explain. :)
