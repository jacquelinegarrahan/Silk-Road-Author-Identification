				There was a thread on this forum with a long ass debate with the site creator over a year ago. You may be able to find it.<br /><br />That site suffers from the same problem as Privnote: you have to trust a third party, which increases your attack surface. It&#039;s dumb because you can trivially avoid that attack surface by using PGP.<br /><br />If you were worried about the safety of your info when Privnote went offline for a while, then you should have realize that you don&#039;t ultimately trust it and shouldn&#039;t use it. If LE takes the SR server offline, you don&#039;t have to worry about your PGP encrypted messages being compromised.<br />
