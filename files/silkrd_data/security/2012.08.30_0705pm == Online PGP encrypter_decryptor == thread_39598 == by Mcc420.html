				Hi i currently dont have acces to a desktop and I am using a mobile device, i have seen a site on the clearnet igolder but was wondering if there is a darknet version or if someone could point me in the direction of a cracked app that i could use to encrypt or decrypt locally on the device <br /><br />Peace and One Love

				If you have an Android phone there&#039;s an app I looked at a while ago called APG.&nbsp; It looked promising, saying it can:<br /><br />- Manage Secret/Public keys (eg GPG/PGP)<br />- Encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify emails and files<br />- Integration with gMail<br /><br />Among a few other things.&nbsp; May be worth checking out if you have an Android.<br />

				Cheers mate I&#039;ve seen a few but as you sai not too sure as to how well they work. Thats interesting about not having a cell phone I was the same up until recently where I have had to have a phone through necessity rather than personal choice, do you mind me asking why you don&#039;t use a cell phone ? <br /><br />MCC420

				Very interesting I hadn&#039;t heard of any of that. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s time I did some research into what powers are available in relation to cellphone and tracking information in my jurisdiction. I leave my phone at home alot of the time think it may be staying there more often.

				Here is a brief guide I wrote on using GPG command line using Mobile Terminal and&nbsp; iFile on a jail broken iPhone:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27442.msg299005#msg299005<br /><br />. I found openPG to have trouble with certain peoples keys. Also, using a jail broken&nbsp; phone you have full access to your file system. The GPG all takes place in /var/mobile in a folder .GnuPG which is a hidden folder (you have to change iFile settings to show it) Using an app on a unbroken phone I would be worried about it saving incriminating logs somewhere. If you have a jail broke phone you learn to have familiarity with the file system and can delete stuff.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously you have to make your own decisions about whether using a mobile device for this is secure enough for you. But if you are using an iPhone to access SR surely it makes sense to encrypt your communications opposed to not.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are sure your security is perfect then I wouldn&#039;t compromise it by using a mobile device. I have to admit I use my iPhone to access SR. It&#039;s handy for when I&#039;m away from computer. I feel my security would not withstand a focused attack by high class high tech LE , but I&nbsp; think it&#039;s good enough for the low level at which I operate.
