				I am at home pissing myself . Truth is I have zero Bitcoins to my name and from what I can gather quite a few people are now hoarding them as the price goes up in unprecedented amounts every day . The people I am glad for are the &quot;up to 50 Bitcoin &quot; holders , who should exchange for cash now while its at a fantastic price . Then you have the others who have literally 1000s of them . You , Yes YOU are the people I cant wait to see on the day BITCOIN crashes through the floor , back to around 5 USDs each . Greed has a lot to answer for and I hope the Greediest are stung the Hardest .<br />&nbsp;Anyway now Ive vented my frustration over being skint , Have a nice Day .<br />&nbsp;Watch out for the inevitable crash .<br />&nbsp; Yours Necromancer71 :o

				A lot of &quot;hoarders&quot; might call themselves &quot;savers&quot; - point being, they are intending to keep their BTC for a longer time-period, until they can be used for everyday services.&nbsp; There are already several websites where consumer electronics can be had for BTC, and there&#039;s even a bar in NYC accepting BTC for drinks.<br /><br />Additionally, I am of the opinion that anything that is driven at least in part by vice, will have staying power.&nbsp; The increasing size of SR insures that there will always be a very attractive use for BTC, and as more vendors jump on the wagon, interest + utility + exchange rate on BTC will only increase.

				This BTC coin thing isn&#039;t a zero sum game. That is, just because somebody has become prosperous through BTC, he isn&#039;t making it at the expense of somebody else. The early adopters of BTC, probably among the largest holders of BTC, enabled BTC to grow and a &#039;rising tide raises all boats&#039;. <br />I like rich people. They are mostly the people who hire me for my construction work. Of course I despise dishonest people, especially in the trades, because they can hurt you in so many ways. Recently I finally got some money for some work I performed 2 YEARS ago. I hope that sob goes through some things that I had to go through in 2 years while waiting for my money. <br />You&#039;re right, there will be a &#039;correction&#039; in BTC sometime, and people will lose money. But that won&#039;t help you either, because (mostly) the prices in BTC go down as BTC goes up. I&#039;ve noticed things costing less BTC lately, has anybody noticed venders NOT &#039;correcting&#039;?<br />Somebody said &#039;Dominos&#039; takes BTC for pizza. Anybody know if that is true?

				I read early on this year in the news of a service where you could order pizza for BTC but it was more of a middle-man site accepting your BTC and paying $$ to the pizza dudes to bring you pizza.<br />As for BTC imho I don&#039;t think the price is going down anytime soon.&nbsp; For longer than Bitcoins have been around, people have been waking up to the fact that, at least in NA, our governments sold us out to private bankers.&nbsp; We are forced to use fiat notes that earn bankers interest just by existing.&nbsp; There is no money that wasn&#039;t created from thin air and that isn&#039;t costing compounding interest: owed by the money supply to the central banking elites.&nbsp; And since that compounding interest cost can only be paid with money created by elites and costing compound interest...well, how are those chains?&nbsp; Too tight for you?&nbsp; Fuck you asshole ha ha ha.&nbsp; Here suck my cock now.&nbsp; Sorry, we&#039;re not quite there yet, but most of us don&#039;t see the shackles.&nbsp; We don&#039;t get to just create money and let it devalue all the rest of the money.&nbsp; The banks get to create it and devalue all the rest of the money and then they loan it to us at interest.<br />I think people are slowly waking up to that and I think they see bitcoin as a currency that bankers can never enslave us with.&nbsp; Yet it is also a currency that can be infinitely divided to suit the needs of the economy.<br />Sure right now, no one wants to spend it because it&#039;s going up so fast that it&#039;s not that useful as a currency unless you make quick transactions.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t expect it to go down as A. more and more people learn about it and B more and more people wake up to the fact that any use of fiat currency funds global economic terrorism.<br />Not being a slave = Priceless.
