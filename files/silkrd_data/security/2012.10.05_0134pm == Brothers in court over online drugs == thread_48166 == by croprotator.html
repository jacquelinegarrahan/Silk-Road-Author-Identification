				&quot;Police have seized cannabis, ecstasy and speed bought from an underground website described as an &quot;eBay for drugs&quot; after two teenage brothers were allegedly caught importing the drugs to Esperance from Melbourne and Canada.&quot;<br /><br />http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/14980079/brothers-in-court-over-online-drugs/<br /><br />Jesus people... your first line of security is not letting your mum look at your mail!<br />

				I think the biggest danger to to SR is kids. As soon as one them OD&#039;s and their purchase is linked to SR there will be a hell-storm of bad press, publicity attacks and general calls to shut it down pronto. Personally, I don&#039;t think kids should be consuming unregulated drugs (drugs are &#039;bad&#039; m&#039;kay!) <br /><br />As someone else on another thread said - It&#039;s too bad we live in a world where responsible adults aren&#039;t &quot;allowed&quot; to get high. If we did this whole underground thing would be unnecessary and the whole process would be a lot safer - i.e. - no jackass kids.

				Those kids were betrayed by their parents, who decided to have the criminal justice system raise them and do the job they themselves failed at. Shame on them.<br /><br />If society had a mature way of dealing with narcotics, without prohibition or excessive taxation, we wouldn&#039;t need an anonymous marketplace. Then society could make sensible rules to prevent minors from obtaining narcotics. <br /><br />But until that day, it&#039;s the law of the cryptographic jungle that rules.

				i realise the parents probably had a heart attack but i still give them -1 karma for informing on them. <br />(i mean c&#039;mon, at least send them to a drug education program or rehab before you call the cops for cripes sake! :-\)<br /><br />the brothers should be old enough to know how to be careful. so i give them both -5 for getting them selves in the shit due to their cavalier attitudes that no doubt led to a failure in dilligent package receiving processes. ;) (i still feel for the cheeky scamps tho&#039;, we were all young &amp; reckless at one point!)<br /><br />be safe peeps<br />&nbsp;;)

				im glad my mom doesnt fuck with my shit.<br /><br />but seriously they didnt need to turn there own kids in, simply destroying the drugs and punishing/grounding them somehow would have been enough. this is gonna ruin it for us all

A Common sense view that I 100% agree with. Unfortunately, there are other threads on the same topic with people praising these two kids, calling them child proteges and Revolutionaries. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad we live in a world where responsible adults aren&#039;t &quot;allowed&quot; to get high.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />This is sadly, so true. Kid&#039;s and drugs are two words that I don&#039;t want to see in the same sentence. Once they turn 18, they have the rest of their lives to do as they please.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
