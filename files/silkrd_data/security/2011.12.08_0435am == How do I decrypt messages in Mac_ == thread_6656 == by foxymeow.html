				Hey Foxy<br />here is a link to a pretty good tutorial. http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/02/18/working-with-pgp-and-mac-os-x/ <br /><br />can I ask what version of OS X you are using? (10.5.8 etc?)<br /><br />also there was a pretty good thread about this already if you just keep clicking through the security forum :)

				pgp is the technology, either:-<br /><br />&quot;primarily&quot; email<br />1. if you specifically want to encrypt / decrypt emails in a mailbox then aside from cut &amp; paste to decrypt messages yourself a program could do that for you, and yes in this<br />case it would have to be able to auto integrate into thunderbird if thats what your email prog is..{since the user wants automation and why should the user have to manually decrypt every single poxy msg ...yes]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - trying to email a pgp signed email to the forum users as if it were sent from the forum is not going to be of much use with thunderbird cos you&#039;d&nbsp; need to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; know their email address hypothetically...; the only way to send an encrypted message from the &quot;send pm&quot; functionality on this forum would be to encrypt<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the text yourself and manually cut &amp; paste the signed pgp resulting text into a forum &#039;send message&#039; window and send....<br /><br />encrypt files/text<br />2. now pgp or the other incarnations like GnuPGP {=GPG}&nbsp; {pgp being the technology...yes?!} allow us to encrypt &amp; decrypt messages typed up in notepad / gedit / wordpad etc etc, but in some cases it has to be done from the commandline if for example symantec&#039;s pgp GUI doesn&#039;t provide that functionality...<br /><br />ok<br />

You have to configure &quot;Services&quot; to add functions &quot; Open PGP Encrypt&quot; and &quot;Open PGP decrypt&quot; in this menu, then you have to highlight the message you to decrypt an select the service &quot;Open PGP decrypt&quot;.<br /><br />WL

				You do all the encrypting and decrypting inside the textedit app. The screencast link above explains this very well. :)

				It works.<br /><br />- Install GPGTools for Mac: http://www.gpgtools.org/<br /><br />- Open up GPG Keychain Access and generate a key for yourself.<br /><br />- Export your public key, so you can give it to others (others will use it to encrypt messages for you, which you can ONLY decrypt with your private key. So keep your private key very VERY secure!!).<br /><br />- Import any public keys of people you want to communicate securely with.<br /><br />- Open System Preferences, go to Keyboard and click Services in the left pane. In the right pane, enable all &#039;OpenPGP&#039; options under &#039;Text&#039;.<br /><br />- Start TextEdit, type something, select the text and you&#039;ll get the options to encrypt (or decrypt) it. Information you want to send to someone, you encrypt it with their public key. Information you receive which is encrypted by your public key, can be decrypted using your private key.<br /><br />If you want you can also configure it to use Mail.app or Thunderbird, this means you don&#039;t have to manually encrypt and decrypt e-mail messages (the mail program will do it for you, automatically selecting the right key, etc). I believe Mail.app works out of the box, Thunderbird requires an extension like Enigmail.
