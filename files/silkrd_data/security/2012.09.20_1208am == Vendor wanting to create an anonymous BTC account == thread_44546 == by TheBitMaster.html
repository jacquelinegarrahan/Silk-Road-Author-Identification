				Hello I know this is a very basic question and one that has been asked a number of times but even after searching and researching I have still not found a definite clear answer.<br />As a future vendor, what BTC client does not require personal information and works on the TB? I believe that after creating multiple accounts with an anonymous client then I can receive the bitcoin at one, send them back and forth between my accounts, send them to a non anonymous client such as MT gox or other client that enables me to cash out.<br /><br />Would these be the correct steps to take and do I have a relatively decent idea as to how this stuff works? Please do not respond with &quot;This is not the place to ask this on a forum&quot; or &quot;No one will answer that here&quot; because this section is quite clearly labeled with the keywords anonymity, security, bitcoin so this would be the place to ask this. If anyone could pm answers or email me as well that would be much appreciated as well. Thanks in advance :-)
