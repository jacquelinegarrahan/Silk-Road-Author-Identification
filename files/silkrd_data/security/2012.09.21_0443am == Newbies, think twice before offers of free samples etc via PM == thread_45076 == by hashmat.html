				It hit me the other day, that on occassion, I&#039;ve answered posts re: free samples, cheap samples etc.<br />The worst part part being, I&#039;ve sent them a name and address, sometimes sending some btc to cover postage.<br />Few days ago, sitting there, wondering why i had guite a few things in transit;<br />&#039;Fuck me! They could have been LE, what easier way to get our info?&quot;<br />Anyway, it&#039;s been OK, samples have come, have written review, but it could so much <br />easily have been the other way.<br />So in future, Im not giving out details unless it&#039;s from a vendor (although LE can open vendor accounts), and<br />I&#039;ve thought it through.<br />IF IT&#039;S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE--99% CHANCE IT ISNT FUCKING TRUE, please try to live by this mantra- I do.

				Yeah wise words indeed, I have done it in the past too. Later I came to the same conclusion that it&#039;s probably not a good idea to send address details to a non-vendor account :)

				Yes recently I seen a new vendor offering a large quantity of &quot;free samples&quot; I almost got one then thought &quot;hey that could be a LE account is it worth giving my info for $15...I think not&quot;

				The mongrels play on our weakness, we think, &#039; that sounds cool, just try it for fre, then give a good review&#039;, I&#039;ve learnt it takes practice to think thimgs through before leaping. Theres was another offering CHina White at a great [rice, but he was &#039;in the process&#039; of getting his vendor account started, and the price was awesome. I PMed him saying, that when he has his vendor ac up etc, I&#039;ll be 1st to give honest review via SR, NOT JUST THE FORUM, he hasnt replied yet.lol. There should be a sticky warning I think, warning people not tojump straight into giving addressess etc, for samples, just through the forum, LE know us well man, they have people on it every day, looking for weaknessess, ways to get a tidbit of personal information. .Once they have a potential hint of a users name,location,nickname whatever man, they&#039;re straight into that <br />database of exabytes of information on all of us, waiting to link a name with a word, whatever.<br />We can NEVER be too paranoid guys.

				The second reason I avoided the &quot;free samples&quot; with a new vendor was it would give the vendor some amazing feedback scores and this would be an easy way to gain creditability in a quick manor if I was looking to scam people. not all scammers are quick and easy some will invest time and money to set the proper stage! If it sounds like I am paranoid is because I am.&nbsp; I always follow the basic rule of..... if it sounds to good to be true then it probably isn&#039;t.&nbsp; In my books the Vendors need to earn there feedback and not buy it. I appreciate that the vendors need to get people to sample and gain feedback and samples is a way to accomplish this I just choose not to partake in this exercise my choice......&nbsp; God i love this place that allows me to make my own decisions called SR

				I was offered a free sample and got an empty package. Sender assumed I was a scammer, then claims to have found the product sitting in his house. I&#039;d love to know if he reshipped it or not but he won&#039;t return any messages. The day he was supposed to reship, I got a message saying something happened and he&#039;d send it out after he resolved the issue. It&#039;s been like 3 days now and still no word. Personally, I don&#039;t give a fuck about the free shit, I just want to know WTF is going on and is a package coming to my drop or not? <br /><br />This is from a senior member that just opened up a vendor account. He offered the sample to me as a kind gesture -- I didn&#039;t ask for shit. He eventually listed samples of the product he wanted to send me but I wasn&#039;t aware of this until it was already too late to go out and buy coins. If he wanted me to pay shipping or whatever than he should of told me prior to listing the shit. Now I have no idea if he sent me something in the fucking mail and didn&#039;t tell me or just assumed &quot;this dude just wants free product, he&#039;s too cheap to pay for shipping, fuck him&quot; even though I had no btc in my account nor did I know he was listing samples.<br /><br />There have been several reports of strange vendor behavior lately. Lots of members getting shorted on orders, this fake sample shit mentioned in the OP, etc. Is this LE trying to sow paranoia or just a sudden outbreak of sheister disease? Now some dude has an address that I use and I have no idea what his intentions are. I swear, if they are going through this much trouble to get the address of a buyer of grams of pot, I am moving the fuck out of the US.
