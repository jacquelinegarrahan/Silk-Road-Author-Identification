				Hello SR, I was really wondering this lately. I am planning on ordering some 25i-NBOMe blotters from a vendor here, but I have yet to get bitcoins. But my question is, since that chemical is legal in the states(at least I believe it is, any clarification?), and it is the ONLY thing I plan on purchasing, do I need to do all the precursors defined in the sticky here? For example, can I go about getting BTC in a less time-consuming way? Going to the bank with a money order is possible, but if there is a way around it in this scenario I would much rather not.. I would still tumble it so there wouldn&#039;t be any traces that I personally made the purchase from SR(at least that is my assumption).<br /><br />I am probably never going to order anything else off here, if I do, then I would definitely do everything in that thread, just to be safe. Another reason I ask is because there are vendors on the clear net that sell 25i-NBOMe blotters also..<br /><br />If I could do this, anybody have any idea on how I can buy some BTC? Should I just do MT Gox with my debit card? Or maybe a pre-paid visa purchased with cash at the local gas station? All of this will be done inside of a VM running windows 7(an unattended version) which would then be completely erased after I receive my order.<br /><br />I hope someone that can answer my question chimes in soon enough! I must say I really love what you guys are doing here.. I first found out about silk road a little over a year ago and I seem to recall BTC being 2.50 USD.. I checked MT. GOX and they&#039;re up to 11 USD.. Should have invested...<br /><br />Or I could just have the wrong idea on all of this :(

				Bump.<br /><br />Basically what I am asking is that can I just buy bitcoins with a debit card, then tumble them, put them in SR wallet, then buy the 25i-NBOMe blotters? <br /><br />Thank you for your time.
