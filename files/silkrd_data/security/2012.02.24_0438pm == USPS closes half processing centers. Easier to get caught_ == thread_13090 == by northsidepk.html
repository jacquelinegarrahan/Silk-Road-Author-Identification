				So the USPS is closing 223 of there 450 processing centers.<br /><br />Less places to search equals more seizures was my concern.<br /><br />But maybe more volume through less centers equals less seizures?<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />BTW read the news, any news. Washington Post, Huffington Post, Google it, whatever, USPS is in deep doo-doo right now

				If anything I would think that it would result in fewer seizures.

				Logically I would think it would do the opposite. Half the centers closing means 2 times more mail is going through the centers. Which mean it&#039;s going to be harder to search everything.

				Snail mail&#039;s becoming obsolete as more and more things go digital. We need to get with the times and find a way to share drugs digitally...<br />3D drug printer anyone?

In their shipping policies, it says they can open anything. USPS packages require a warrant to open.&nbsp; <br /><br />In theory it adds a bit of time where you could get suspicious that the package was intercepted as they wait for the drug agent and the dog to check the package, confirm suspect drugs, get the warrant, then open the box.&nbsp; On the other hand, the USPS has been so goddamn slow and unreliable since Herr Bush and the Republicans gutted them and left them to die. (2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act)<br />A package taking an extra 2-3 days could just be normal anymore...<br /><br />But really, if your packaging isn&#039;t sufficient and the box is leaking or reeks of weed so bad it&#039;s stinking up the truck they&#039;re going to get a warrant. So UPS, FedEx, or USPS, they&#039;re all going to open it regardless...&nbsp; and if it&#039;s packed all nice-like, it&#039;s going to get delivered.<br /><br />
