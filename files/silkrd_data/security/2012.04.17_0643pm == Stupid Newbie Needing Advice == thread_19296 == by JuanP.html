				hi Juan,<br /><br />Welcome to the forums :)<br /><br />As to your post i would stay away from using a CC or debit card, it just seems a unnecessary risk. personally I use MT gox via uk cash deposit (all info can be found on the mt gox site) and then run my coins though a couple wallets/mixer and then to SR. If you need the coins quickly a straight transfer from mt gox to SR would take about two days from cash in to coins on SR (average sometimes can be longer)

				If there&#039;s any way to go through Getbitcoins.com I&#039;d do that.&nbsp; MtGox will ask you for detailed ID somewhere along the way, &amp; your Bitcoins and/or cash will be frozen until you comply.&nbsp; MtGox rarely lets people get away without providing all sorts of personal info ~~ oh &amp; don&#039;t think of accessing MtGox through Tor because they have a list of Tor exit nodes &amp; will just make it harder for you.

				i&#039;m not so sure all that is necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;no one really knows what you are buying.&nbsp; hell they don&#039;t know for sure who&#039;s coin it is the moment it leave mt gox.&nbsp; how can they know what the sr address is?&nbsp; <br /><br />so IF silk road get raided what then.&nbsp; at best they will have one transaction where u bot some dope.&nbsp; the address to your house was probably already deleted if you didn&#039;t use pgp.&nbsp; <br /><br />i got a feeling that everything on the back end of SR is tight.&nbsp; IF THEY&nbsp; get raided, watch no one else go down.&nbsp; thats my thoughts.&nbsp; The security of SR with the tumblers built in, it would be a real bitch to try to trace the coin.&nbsp; it would be a very circumstantial case if it ever even lead to an identity.
