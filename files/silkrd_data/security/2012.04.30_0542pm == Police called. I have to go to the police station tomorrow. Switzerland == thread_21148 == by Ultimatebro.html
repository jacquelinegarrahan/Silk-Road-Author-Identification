				First of all I live in Switzerland.<br />A few weeks ago I didn&#039;t receive a package, thought it was lost but today a man from the Judiciary Police called and asked me to go to the station. He said he couldn&#039;t tell me why on the phone but that it wasn&#039;t severe nor urgent. What the fuck do I do ? I&#039;m kinda shitting my pants right now.

				a) Go to the station. Ask if you are arrested.<br />Yes - &quot;I want a lawyer&quot;.<br />No - &quot;Goodbye&quot;<br /><br />b) Get a lawyer, ask him.<br /><br />And as always, since you&#039;re not arrested that means they don&#039;t have enough evidence. Chill and clean your house.

				Main thing to remember, is you&#039;ve no control over who sends you anything in the mail.&nbsp; Some malicious person, could very well send you drugs, and then call the police over it.&nbsp; Main thing is not to act like a crook: what would a &#039;normal&#039; person do, if someone sent them drugs in the mail, and the police confiscated it?<br /><br />&quot;Thankyou,&quot; answer questions politely and be on your way.&nbsp; If they arrest you, or course, or go any further, then you get a lawyer,&nbsp; but I doubt seriously this will happen...<br /><br />Best wishes.

				keep your mouth shut and play dumb deny everything. I wouldn&#039;t even show up let them come pick you up if they want you down there. If they do immediately request counsel and don&#039;t say anything else until you are able to speak with an attorney.

				Superderp said it right. They can suspect all they want, that&#039;s what they do. They all wanna be Dick Tracey and be the one to crack the big one. Say nothing. They will tell you why you are there. If it&#039;s got to do with mail just say I have idea about anything about any mail, am I under arrest? If they insist on asking more questions you should insist on a lawyer. If they have anything on you they will arrest you anyway, whether you talk or not. I know it feels like you are admitting to being guilty of something by doing that, but if you talk they will take what you say and use it anyway they can against you. You owe it to yourself to have an attorney involved if they intend to charge you with a crime. The lawyer will even the playing field. The cops can bend the rules with you because you don&#039;t know any better, the lawyer being there will prevent that. <br /><br />Also, dont forget that these cops accuse and charge, thats what they do. Nothing you can tell them will change what they plan to do. Your guilt will be decided by a judge, period. If they have enough to charge you, they will. If they are trying to get you to talk its because they want to collect some easy evidence before they arrest you. Believe me when I say this, you talking can only make it worse, it will never make it better because these are cops, not judges. They have no say in anything, they simply collect evidence and charge people with shit.

				1) Buy a piece off the armory just in case and if any old bill turn up at your gaff pop a cap in their asses before turning the gun on yourself (do not leave a letter to confuse your family even more) <br /><br />2) If they do not turn up, get yourself some night vision goggles and start and survey the station they want you to attend. Find out the name of the filth who called you, follow him home and kill his kids pets then ring him from a payphone with a voice scrambler to give him a &#039;warning&#039; of what to expect if they do not turn &#039;off&#039; the heat<br /><br />3) But a new passport off SR and a copy of that book that tells you how to disappear and call yourself Keyse Sose

				Take a xanax, Valium, Klonopin (may need to suck on this one instead of popping it outright) or other benzo before you go. If none are available ask your buddies about headshops that have etizolam or phenazepam, if all of the above fails take Kava-Kava from the health store. <br /><br />Don&#039;t carry any of the above on you, just have enough in your system (e.g. .5 - 1 mg Xanax), taken orally at least 15- 20 min before, to combat anxiety.<br /><br />In the south of the US xanax is used RELIGIOUSLY by Mexican drug smugglers crossing border stations. It helps you keep your composure, and there&#039;s almost no way for them to know its drug induced. Just make sure you dont use benzos regularly and save em for this circumstance, and dont take so much that youre nodding out, low - med low doses.<br /><br />I have been in this position before, in my case it was simply my girlfriend filing complaints and being a stupid bitch, but i sat there for a few hours and didn&#039;t break a sweat. I&#039;d recommend always keeping em handy for situations like this.

They can suspect all they want, that&#039;s what they do. They all wanna be Dick Tracey and be the one to crack the big one. Say nothing. They will tell you why you are there. If it&#039;s got to do with mail just say I have idea about anything about any mail, am I under arrest? If they insist on asking more questions you should insist on a lawyer. If they have anything on you they will arrest you anyway, whether you talk or not. I know it feels like you are admitting to being guilty of something by doing that, but if you talk they will take what you say and use it anyway they can against you. You owe it to yourself to have an attorney involved if they intend to charge you with a crime. The lawyer will even the playing field. The cops can bend the rules with you because you don&#039;t know any better, the lawyer being there will prevent that. <br /><br />Also, dont forget that these cops accuse and charge, thats what they do. Nothing you can tell them will change what they plan to do. Your guilt will be decided by a judge, period. If they have enough to charge you, they will. If they are trying to get you to talk its because they want to collect some easy evidence before they arrest you. Believe me when I say this, you talking can only make it worse, it will never make it better because these are cops, not judges. They have no say in anything, they simply collect evidence and charge people with shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would +1 you if I could. Very good advice.
