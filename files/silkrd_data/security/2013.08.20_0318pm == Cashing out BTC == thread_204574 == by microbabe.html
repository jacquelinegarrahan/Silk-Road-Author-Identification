				Hey guys, so I&#039;ve done a lot of research on this topic, and the only viable option I&#039;ve seen so far has been LocalBitcoins.com. Anonymous visa cards seem risky, and repeated deposits in my bank account seem suspicious as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know this topic is understandably very taboo on these forums, so if anyone would be comfortable pm&#039;ing me some advice instead, I would be VERY much appreciated. <br /><br />Criteria I&#039;m considering is <br />1) How quickly I can get cash for BTC<br />2) Level of anonymity <br />3) Volume of BTC I can cash out at one time/weekly

				By partial amount you don&#039;t mean a very tiny percentage didn&#039;t make it, do you? Because you know that they charge a random amount between 1% and 3% of the amount to be deposited as their fee.

				Is fog better than blockchain.info&#039;s shared send which cost only .5%?<br /><br />To OP one of the best ways is to find someone on LBC or other places that wants to buy bitcoin for cash in the mail. Once you get someone steady you&#039;re set for a while. Make sure they vacuum pack and send securely though!<br /><br />mm

				Did some research and found this (clearnet warning): https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/sites/default/files/public/department/itsecurity/mbc13/mbc13-moeser-paper.pdf<br /><br />&quot;3.6 Conclusion<br />We can conclude that both Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info<br />make it hard for an attacker to relate input and output<br />transaction. In our analysis of Bitcoin Fog we found a clear<br />structure, making it possible to understand how the service<br />works. This might make it easier for an attacker who has<br />additional information available to detect outgoing transactions. We were not able to find any direct connections in<br />the transaction graph of Blockchain.info. In the analysis of<br />the service BitLaundry, we found direct connections in the<br />transaction graph in two of our three experiments, in the<br />last one we directly received half of the coins, we payed in.<br />Thus, BitLaundry cannot be considered to reliably increase<br />anonymity.&quot;<br /><br />Looks like blockchain.info with it&#039;s .5% fee is the winner according to this study.<br /><br />mm

				Hey guys, so I&#039;ve pretty much given up on those BTC making it to the Fog. Oh well, I have another growing problem....escrow.&nbsp; My escrow has ballooned over the weekend and the beginning of this week.&nbsp; I was not expecting such a strong response to my product! Nevertheless, when that escrow finally gets deposited into my account, I am going to be in a frenzy trying to cash it out to restock on &#039;supplies&#039;.&nbsp; Meeting people face to face with LocalBitcoins is fine if used infrequently, but I need a system in place to dump my BTC into cash weekly (if not more), and hopefully at a reasonable fee.&nbsp; If the past week was an indication of future sales, I am going to need to solve this problem FAST. <br /><br /><br />Please, any expert advice is very much appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked everywhere, but I don&#039;t feel safe Googling &#039;how do I launder bitcoins&#039;, this community is my best resource!<br /><br /><br />-Microbabe<br />

				People that get in a hurry make mistakes so be careful. With localbitcoin you at least have escrow. Figure out a percentage of coin you could sell for cash deposit at bank; say 25% and 50% via cash in mail and the remaining 25% at in person meetups. You should already know that people who buy coins, buy them for less than any official exchange rate.

				We need some vendors to partake in this thread, because this seems to be a good topic of conversation. I&#039;m aware of a few ways to do it myself, but have no idea what is the quickest, most anonymous method of doing so. So I&#039;m interested myself.

				It may be that selling gold coins that match the country you are in has less reporting requirements than other gold? I think I read that somewhere here.<br /><br />I think most localbitcoin.com transactions for cash are done by mail/internet without meeting people in person. The otc/irc aspects of it have kept me away, but, I here that is where you can learn who to trust for deals that are not &quot;in person&quot;. Once you have a person or persons that you trust, I think it becomes no big deal to do it regularly.

				IDK seems like the best way to cash out involves methods that dont involve your mailing address. Right now bitcoin is too small to start putting yourself on lists, maybe if u live in LA or NY then its not such a big deal but for everyone else theres not a whole lot of btc users so any sort of btc related activity that leaves behind an address is pretty risky.<br /><br />I put up a post about a p2p cashinmail exchange, its risky considering how easy it is to cheat it but if i were to give out my address it would have to be to a random stranger who isnt involved with SR and not some business who can easy be snooped by LEO.

				Excellent discussion highlighting the PSEUDO-anonymity afforded by bitcoin.&nbsp; Please, everyone be aware that no method is fully anonymous.&nbsp; At some point you have to reveal who you are.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same with Tor: you are not fully protected, you are just hoping to make tracing you more trouble than it&#039;s worth.<br /><br />

				&quot;if whatever you are doing doesn&#039;t pass the &quot;could they catch me if I were selling nuclear warheads filled with jihadi literature and baby-rape videos&quot; test, you probably shouldn&#039;t view it as secure. &quot;<br /><br />ok that one made me laugh! Good point too. I would also like to put in the fact that the odds of being traced backwards from some kind of bitcoin cashout is pretty small. Think of it from the cops perspective. Most cops are LOCAL. They are concerned with local crimes including drug crimes (the local crack houses or they got a tip where a pot dealer lives so they stake it out.) SR drug deals are very different in that they are non-localized. While I&#039;m sure there is some LEO&#039;s on here reading and taking notes, if you don&#039;t give out personal info, you don&#039;t have much to worry about it there. Most cops are also very technically illiterate. They can use the police software they have been trained on, a web browser and windows solitaire. They may have heard of SR, onion networks, encryptions, bitcoins etc but really what are they going to do?&nbsp; They have no idea about any of that shit and are too busy (or in most cases even smart enough) to bother to learn. They&#039;re going to pass it on up to the DEA or something similar who have their hands full and aren&#039;t as concerned with 95% of SR small time vendors who are tiny fish to them. DEA is going after big fish selling pounds of heroin and crack and CP and LARGE financial transactions that they can trace.&nbsp; Sure they&#039;ll bust someone who clearly fucks up but it&#039;s not like they&#039;re rabidly chasing down each individual vendor or even realizes someone is cashing out huge amounts of bitcoin....this shit is just invisible unless you REALLY fuckup. So yeah, play it safe, but also sleep well <br /><br />A few cashout ideas that work:<br /><br />- Local Bitcoins - you can&#039;t draw attention to yourself with $10,000 deals with a stranger, but you can definitely develop a clientele and move a lot of coin if you live in an urban area. Owe someone (like your landlord) money? Get their bank account info and sell bitcoin for bank transfer directly to their account and you can pay your rent with it or send money to people you owe. You can use multiple account on LBC and deal with different people to obscure any digital paper trail.<br /><br />- Bitcurex cards - they&#039;re a bit of a pain but they do work.<br /><br />-Bitcoin - Buy as much as you can in bitcoin. whatever you need to buy google it and see if there is either a straight bitcoin purchase or you can buy a gyft card at amazon, lowes, CVS, Sears, Fandango, a number of chain restaurants and other stuff. Lots of stuff actually. You can purchase the cards anonymously and they work on androids.&nbsp; You can also buy cards from other places to pay for cellphone, WOW and tons of other stuff. There&#039;s bitmit.net, http://bitbrochure.com and so many other bitcoin economy stores and services sprouting everywhere. We just have to change our buying habits. You also get the satisfaction of using bitcoin which I love. I think it&#039;s a revolution and want to use bitcoin as much as possible. Every bitcoin deal represents money that is not going into the hands of the corporate overlords. Buy with bitcoin and fuck the system!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				While it&#039;s great to see cash out options like White-Out, I would suggest that anyone taking advantage of this on a large scale be using a PO box gotten with a fake id. If you are on Silk Road cashing out $5-$10,000 a week and getting it sent to your real name and address you&#039;re a fool. If I was LEO setting up a cash-out option like this would be one of the first things I&#039;d do. I&#039;m not saying White-Out or any particular vendor is LEO....likely not, but the chance exists.&nbsp; If you are cashing out serious dough on a regular basis don&#039;t in ANY WAY connect it to your name or home address!

It may deter a lot of LE action along those lines. Sadly, if LE is motivated/funded well enough and they can find the person getting the cash, they may be able to track them to any illicit operation that is generating the cashflow. Even if they don&#039;t, you still have to worry about getting caught not paying taxes on the cash if you get a lot without a great story about how you got the coins. All these issues can be protected against if good advance planning occurs. Not easy though.

To highlight the most relevant part of the article:<br /><br />&quot;But Meiklejohn and her colleagues at UCSD and George Mason University have found that a little snooping in the blockchain can often uncover who owns which of those Bitcoin addresses. In a paper they’re presenting at the Internet Measurement Conference in Barcelona next month, they showed that they could use “clustering” methods taking advantage of clues in how bitcoins are typically aggregated or split up to identify thousands of addresses based on just a few test transactions they performed. With the data from just 344 of their own transactions, they were able to label the owners of more than a million Bitcoin addresses.&quot;<br /><br />Apparently they were able to distinguish which coins came from SR by using cluster analysis on the coins. I don&#039;t if this is a 100% foolproof method but it is a solid tactic if one needed to trace the orgins of some coins.<br /><br />Also there&#039;s a lot of sites that take bitcoins for payments so if you can spend some bitcoins instead of cash and things you could use in real life then take a look at :<br /><br />CLEARNET: https://www.spendbitcoins.com/places/<br /><br />It&#039;s just a pretty big directory of places that take Bitcoins and some parting thoughts. Typically when cashing our dirty money you have two options. You can try to hide it as much as possible or you can incorporate it into a legit business that you made. Think of your hobbies or things that you like and get creative and see how you could make money doing that. It has to be something plausible . Obviously you can&#039;t start a landscaping company and then show that all your cleints pay you in Bitcoins.

Think of your hobbies or things that you like and get creative and see how you could make money doing that. It has to be something plausible . Obviously you can&#039;t start a landscaping company and then show that all your cleints pay you in Bitcoins. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Technically, you could call it &quot;Bitcoin Lanscape Services&quot; and only accept Btc. Claim you were doing it that way to support the alternative currency. To avoid issues over jobs needing to be paid for by locals - unless you want to claim your clients fly you all over the nation or world to do landscaping - it might work better to be &quot;Bitcoin Landscape Design&quot;, since you can do that remotely.
