Therefore, its area<br />of operations exceeds the territorial limits of conventional warfare, to<br />penetrate the political entity itself: the &quot;political animal&quot; that<br />Aristotle defined.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In effect,the human being should be considered the priority objective<br />in a political war. And conceived as the military target of guerrilla war,<br />the human being has his most critical point in his mind. Once his mind has<br />been reached, the&quot;political animal&quot; has been defeated, without necessarily<br />receiving bullets.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guerrilla warfare is born and grows in the political environment; in<br />the constant combat to dominate that area of political mentality that is<br />inherent to all human beings and which collectively constitutes the<br />&quot;environment&quot; in which guerrilla warfare moves, and which is where<br />precisely its victory or failure is defined.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This conception of guerrilla warfare as political war turns<br />Psychological Operations into the decisive factor of the results. The<br />target, then, is the minds of the population, all the population: our<br />troops, the enemy troops and the civilian population.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This book is a manual for the training of guerrillas in psychological<br />operations, and its application to the concrete case of the Christian and<br />democratic crusade being waged in Nicaragua by the Freedom Commandos.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome!<br />

Thus, free speech comes at a price: privacy. Threats to other people, like in the case of Boston, deserve digital and physical intrusion into their lives; this scenario is a socioeconomic pitfall and has lasting trauma in any given set of society. Who better to do that than an agency and intelligence community than the country that always promises peace and prosperity--if available?<br /><br />This is a difficult conversation to have, and many of us have chosen our own path, independent of others and their opinions. It is for the best of everyone that individuals take responsibility for their own peace and prosperity. The optimum approach is to create a successful career that benefits others as well as ourselves--avoiding harmful cultural practices. Love is the best drug ever to exist.<br /><br />Another difficulty is how well people are at lying. Every human lies. Our minds are immaterial extensions of our material bodies, thus our lives are filled with bad information. On Bullshit by Harry G Frankfurt is a short, but very interesting read. &quot;Deny, deny, deny&quot; is frequent advice on the forums. It works, too, in order to keep society from losing money to its &quot;punishment&quot; scheme of incarceration--instead of treatment, medical care, or simply a ride home! An aside: Drunk and belligerent in public? Cops should call a cab, not incite violence. When aggressive authority figures approach a situation involving alcohol in a private or semi-private environment, they are creating a bigger conflict than would otherwise have occurred....<br /><br />So where does that leave us? Governments lie, because governments are operated by people. We have a responsibility to serve personal interests of safety and security, peace and prosperity, since it is our lives that we are hedging on. If I die tonight because a drunk driver killed me, then it is as much my responsibility as it is LE&#039;s responsibility to prevent DUI fatalities. My options are exponentially better than LE because I am not a rank and file stooge, believing that everything will get better if more people are in jail; or do I fantasize about being right all the time, ready to put fellow men and women in a cage for lying to me, when the arresting officer lies as much as anyone else. <br /><br />Don&#039;t think people are so different from each other. The only thing that changes throughout society is the gravity of our lies.
