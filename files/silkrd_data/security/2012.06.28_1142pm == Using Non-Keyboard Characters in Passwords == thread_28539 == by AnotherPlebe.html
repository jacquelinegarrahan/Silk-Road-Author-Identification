				Hey guys, I searched the forums here, and couldn&#039;t find anything discussing the possibility of using non-keyboard characters in passwords in order to increase the security.<br />My thought was that every character set I&#039;ve seen for bruteforcing passwords has contained only letters, numbers, or regular symbols, so by using symbols like Æ (alt+658), you could avoid most bruteforce attacks. Howsecureismypassword.net seems to agree with me. When I enter in one of my lesss secure passwords, it tells me it&#039;ll take about 778 thousand years for a desktop pc to crack it. However, when I substitute one digit in my password with Æ, it tells me that it&#039;ll take about 49 trillion years. That&#039;s quite the jump, much more than just substituting that digit with the character code, 658.<br />I didn&#039;t want to only rely on howsecureismypassword.net, however, so I came here. What is your opinion on using non-keyboard characters? How much do they actually improve the security of a password? I don&#039;t think it can really be as good as howsecureismypassword.net indicates, or else every password creation guide ever would advise including one or two.<br /><br />Also, how applicable are the figures produced&nbsp; by howsecureismypassword.net? I realize that I&#039;m not really a high profile target, seeing as I&#039;m not a vendor and not downloading CP or anything, but if for some reason LE was trying to crack my passwords, I&#039;m figuring they wouldn&#039;t just be using some shitty desktop pc, they might have a dedicated machine for it. Thanks!

				Ah, thank you. Lots of information there. And I suppose you&#039;re correct about the Diceware, but I still think non-keyboard characters could be a way of shortening my current Diceware password (8 words) while still keeping the same security. But I suppose it doesn&#039;t matter as long as I can memorize my 8 words. Thank you!

You don&#039;t need to rely on high-ASCII characters to increase the search space. You can construct a secure enough passphrase using a method such as Diceware.&nbsp; If you use 8-10 Diceware words, your passphrase will not be amenable to brute force in your lifetime. <br /><br />See: http://www.diceware.com/ <br /><br />Guru<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;ve been lurking around the forums for a while before diving in, and from what I&#039;ve read, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a more upstanding member than Guru here. Always pleasant, not a bad word to say about anybody, and a fountain of great info to boot. If I had the power, I&#039;d +1 him all over the place.<br /><br />Darkwave
