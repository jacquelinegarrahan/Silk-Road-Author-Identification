				This Pgp encryption stuff is complicated, but I finally think I&#039;ve gotten how to do it. I don&#039;t plan to pass encrypted messages back and forth, I just plan to send an encrypted message with my name, address; you know, sensitive information. From what I got from all the tutorials, first I send --- <br /><br />When I make my order, I message -- <br /><br />Key ID - 587C61C6 <br />Fingerprint - 9B6C BFC1 4C8E 6186 5786&nbsp; C07C 9E04 1084 587C 61C6<br /><br />then the encrypted message -- <br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />hQEMA0gDbhCYZD3lAQf9GhB4kzZhIzmdaHBnmw6oxPO0RR0PmXnYUXlTyW3GLj7g<br />6URnTYNsBbb0EPBu/z0ZuWq6K4saED0Wu0hgVbWigePsKAfg0l9nDd6EglgIXLFz<br />j9sRcFRT/5ajjRQx4B03e+rFLxzjqJ1Fnvcf+cE40WGevVXWR6BSdz0DzOOxoyAz<br />dXC2Si1zQQHs5xbD8jAH3FCV/Ezj+v8zlNEhL7jtb72ppQSzdMNzCVF/cSzWlTbD<br />jtbRw0F1H9tyJYDuuieaujw/bz7z86Nse7eadZ1n5UCnNgeMPbmMcTOpKPzX6qF1<br />LdS/ttLt78YcusTWgUgSxLZ2PyKvjKTOCrlG0JHVRNJnAcvIacQ70HfvNo794pxa<br />YM+WBX4mM4Oq9vmtgPasDPW9ylMC7biSNBzWzqBfGWw4W+YW7nb3WehhciWIvE0O<br />03KfH1O0NyNJio9PHfX9ctwbZ8HJh3km1Ay+q51t4h6MmX6TA6S08w==<br />=TXi3<br />-----END PGP MESSAGE-----<br /><br />I think I followed the directions correctly, would anyone be kind enough to test this?<br /><br />Thank you so much for your time.<br /><br />-g01d3n

The message can only be decrypted by the person for whom you encrypted it.<br /><br />Who would that be, in this case?<br />Whose public key did you use to encrypt this message?<br />And where did you get that public key from?<br /><br />PGP reports that this message is encrypted for a recipient with key ID 98643DE5. Is that your own key, or a specific vendor&#039;s key? If the latter, then only that vendor can decrypt the message (and if the former then only you can decrypt it).<br /><br />As for sending your own key ID and fingerprint, I can&#039;t see why that would be necessary if you plan to only SEND encrypted messages and do not need to receive them. In any case that information would be useless if you haven&#039;t also posted your key on a public key server. It would be more useful instead to send a link to your public key itself (but again, only if you intend to RECEIVE encrypted messages, which you said you don&#039;t).<br /><br />But tbh your best bet is to go talk to Astor and others in the PGP Club forum thread, at:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938<br />rather than starting any more new forum threads on the subject. <br /><br />Or alternatively, re-read the advice that SelfSovereignty and Wadozo gave you in your other thread, until you feel you have grasped the concepts of key-pairs and of using the RECIPIENT&#039;s public key to encrypt a message to that recipient (and then practice in the PGP Club thread).<br /><br />If it helps you feel better about your security, I confirm that I cannot decrypt this message, because I am not the one for whom it was encrypted. But that&#039;s all I can confirm, and all any of us can confirm, except the person for whom this message was encrypted. Only he/she can confirm the other part of what you want, i.e. that your vendor/recipient/whomever can decrypt your message (while nobody else can).<br /><br />Also, if you want to practice sending encrypted messages to me, that&#039;s fine but don&#039;t send any sensitive information! Just pretend I&#039;m your vendor, import my public key (from the link in my forum signature below), encrypt a message to me using my public key, post it on here or in a PM to me, and I&#039;ll let you know if I was able to decrypt it. Also, if your software gives an option to sign your message as well as encrypting it, don&#039;t do it. Un-check the signing option if applicable, and only encrypt.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				EDIT: It seems the above poster said the exact same thing while I was typing the below, except with more info. I will leave this here in case you want to use the key I included. <br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you much without knowing the pubkey of your recipient. However, I can tell you that all 3 messages you posted as a test (one in this thread, two in the other thread) were encrypted for the same person. Whether that person is your intended recipient, I can&#039;t say. <br /><br />If you want to run a test that someone can check for you, try it with this key (do not send any sensitive info, because I own the private key):<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mI0EUOzStQEEAK2Tx6N21SSTyJFxJ9h6/o1WSj/7LxtlwKpc7s/uNAyoCr92n1it<br />7gFYbQ9aBJykTueVTLzmvAiLhFJTxHrKetedlEaypYD1W+vMuQ1w9DCpLLrlTChs<br />ke+JHI+C1ht4/1Nx3UtFgqpQo+Rmuwh09Xx2SFRc4Il+xkaJjNLBp6HJABEBAAG0<br />GlRlc3R5IFRlc3RlIDx0ZXN0ZUB0ZXMudHk+iLgEEwECACIFAlDs0rUCGwMGCwkI<br />BwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEBv7J+jY7+5evtcEAIBdl7dIPMWdhvTk<br />4b/IakLAkT7hwh72Cbd/YOx6c7ETjm7teO/NpComZfTX4W5Y0r0g6wJ1OPUjmjIV<br />/hl4om2yyAM1H0y0QUocx64K/MAComblqb/DU0IkUd9dofeKRxv3mylpLjDSvB2n<br />skaEHDC30petlfA7NGvLyztwyGztuI0EUOzStQEEAKusa3Q2C1OcAVN7M+NQ6POY<br />aNPMoWCRb0qrRnihEL0yajImwKD2BOpd8Vmb3YE3+w4AOsKE6IH620qukX2HAiQl<br />HSNOQbELWX4xDiNT8YiAvMpELjyz4Y2JZmwtiyOBigJzynQlWrZYzK9UiOGUIpS/<br />FHtmqFmA2Y9qfpr3vhPHABEBAAGInwQYAQIACQUCUOzStQIbDAAKCRAb+yfo2O/u<br />Xmx6A/9ZDaIeByl2kkK10PhGGw2eUOlokobu3iEx8kjxJbx+Ib5LRcVkf8FaFCE/<br />raQr/QTxuf4RP80SOS5A9DZuQbSrCTUoei77VDKX2m3wq4x3TrjvXrm7JCOsaA6T<br />xa9rg66c0YuFcPx+tx7GNZb3eOs3M92OYX8y1L0VsIWwUdSjKw==<br />=iAq5<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Try encrypting the word &quot;Test-icle&quot;, or something else (not sensitive) for me, and I will tell you if you got it right.<br />SELF-CHECK: If you do correctly encrypt it the key I just posted, the first 18 characters of the cipher will be &quot;hIwDfNaI6o1RN6sBA&quot; (after all the dashes and the version). This way, if I don&#039;t respond quickly, at least you&#039;ll know whether you got the recipient right. (this self-check only applies to the key for teste@tes.ty, not to your vendor&#039;s key - the first 18 characters are unique to the public key in RSA)<br /><br />Peace
