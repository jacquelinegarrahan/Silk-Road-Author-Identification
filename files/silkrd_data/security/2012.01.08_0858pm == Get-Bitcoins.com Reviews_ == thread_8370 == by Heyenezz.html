				I think there are a few threads around about this service. But, I&#039;ve used them 3 times. First 2 times were flawless, made a cash deposit and had the coins within a few hours. Currently though my third order is past the 24hr window they guarantee and I&#039;m not getting a response from their email/support. However, I have patience and I believe it&#039;ll work out.<br /><br />Anybody know of other services that offer cash deposit these days? I&#039;m not a fan of Mtgox, Dwolla, etc. all requiring large amounts of personal information.

				I ordered from them at the beginning of december with western union.&nbsp; Took them 5 days to pick up my money and another day to give the deposit.&nbsp; Because of all the time with money in lingo btc was much more when they filled.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents

				I&#039;ve used the cash deposit at both chase and BoA and have always gotten my BTC within 24 hours....usually about 18.&nbsp; You have to make sure you email them a copy of the deposit and follow their simple instructions.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I just used GetBitcoin within the last few days, it&#039;s legit. Placed an order on their site on Wed selecting cash deposit (Chase bank), deposited cash at a nearby Chase on Thurs (no ID required, all you need to specify on the deposit slip is the name and account GetBitcoin emails you) and emailed my receipt, and got my BTC in an eWallet today. Pretty damn quick and easy.<br /><br />That being said, the BTC I received was a little lower than I was expecting. I got a high price for the USB-to-BTC conversion, 7.03 USD to 1 BTC, even though I specified $7 max price on the order form. Not only that, the highest prices on Mt Gox within the past week were $6.5-$6.6 so I&#039;m not sure why the price was so high.&nbsp; Not really that big of a deal, but it was as if they charged a &quot;fee&quot; that wasn&#039;t explained on their site. I sent an email to their support but have not received a response yet. Will provide updates.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Just received a response, looks like they charged a 5% transaction fee and they actually traded for$ 6.68 USD-to-BTC, which is reasonable. Honestly, it&#039;s a lot better than the 10%+ fees you see with all the MP-to-BTC vendors on SR, particularly since I received the BTC so quickly. However, I really wish they would indicate this transaction fee on their site since it is not implied anywhere.<br /><br />EDIT 2: <br />Actually, the 5% transaction fee is explained in their site&#039;s FAQ, so I am a stupid idiot.

				I found this under the FAQ.<br />Q). How much is the fee?<br /><br />A). GetBitcoin charges a 5% fee for purchasing Bitcoins, and a 3% fee for selling Bitcoins. That&#039;s it - there are no other fees or charges of any kind. <br />

				i&#039;ve used them 7 times. always with a cash deposit. the longest it&#039;s taken is just under 24 hours. the fee structure seems quite far. the problem i have with mt gox and the others is there are fees for most of the forms of payment they accept, moneypak or prepaid debit card fees+BC transaction fee+the hassle of getting these things in the first place. <br />so far get-bitcoin seems to be the ones doing it right, or at least they are the least bad option. i wish it were faster, but i usually have my BC within 12 hours. <br />it seems to work faster if you leave your maximum price blank.when i&#039;ve stated a max price those transactions tend to take several hours longer. <br />and since the price of what we&#039;re buying is tied to the exchange rate as long as you&#039;re planning on spending it right away it really doesn&#039;t matter what&nbsp; the exchange rate is. that $60 bag of weed is going to be $60 whether the BC rate is 1-$7 or 1-$3. i learned the hard way not to keep too much just sitting in my account.

				i used them once, and was a little disappointed. I did a cash deposit and sent a photo of the receipt to their email address asap.&nbsp; The price of btc was around 4$.&nbsp; I email them and they wrote back quickly saying they had received my payment, but never confirmed it until a day later, then it took another day to transfer the bitcoins, so it was around 3 days total.&nbsp; Also they guarantee 24 hours or no rate, but he still charged me the 5% , and also the btc had gone up to 5$ so i lost out on that too. He sent them, but it took forever with poor communication

				All major bitcoin exchangers are required by federal law to record identification information about all of their customers.

				I used get-bitcoin last week and for the first time they took longer than 24 hours to process my transaction.&nbsp; They promise 24 hour turnaround or no service charge.&nbsp; They were like 25 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;They still charged the service charge when it did go through so I emailed them and asked about it.&nbsp; They admitted I was right and refunded the Service Charge.&nbsp; They&#039;ve always responded to emails and usually had my coins fairly quick.&nbsp; Nice to see them honor their word on this one.&nbsp; Better than moneypak if you ask me.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve done about a dozen or so transactions with them from early December to as recently as the beginning of this week. All were cash deposits at BA and Chase. Always received BTC under 24 hours with the avg time being 18 hours. Never the &quot;few hours&quot; I see on various forums. Might be the size of my transaction? But I notice that only after midnight did they fill the BTC order. Must be waiting for the BTC market to settle for the day. <br /><br />I simply email them a copy in JPG format of the deposit receipt. Also, I often enter &quot;0&quot; as mix price which means buy BTc at market. <br /><br />I know their website doesn&#039;t look like much. But they are doing a fair bit of business if their order number is a proper indication.

				It is always best to leave the &quot;Max Price&quot; box blank because if the bit price is above your Max Price (even by a little)&nbsp; it will greatly delay your order as they will not fill it if bit price is to high.

				Great service 99% of the time from my experience as well. I&#039;ve also had them be late with it once, but they refunded the service charge. I will also second that they seem to time their purchasing of bitcoins. My coins were not &quot;purchased&quot; until the absolute peak of the BTC market. <br /><br />Usually get my order fulfilled around 9pm-1am, with the occasional early afternoon fulfillment. Lines up horribly with my work schedule so if anybody can recommend another service that accepts cash deposits at a bank, I&#039;d appreciate a recommendation.

				i get the impression that it&#039;s either a one or two man operation. one person i talk to has no idea what the other person is telling me. don&#039;t get me wrong, i&#039;ve had 2 successful cash deposits with them and got my btc within 18hrs both times. on the other hand, i decided to try and send in some prepaid gift cards and here i still sit. i wanted to be sure so i got dcn but because i did it at the 24/7 machine it would only show the final destination&#039;s city, state, and zip. Get-bitcoins basically tells me things get lost and they don&#039;t know that it got to their specific address. let that be a lesson to you if you decide to go that route, make sure you send it at the p.o. desk with priority, dcn#, and may as well do a return receipt.

				I&#039;ve used them twice so far and had a good experience. The first time it took them about 12 - 14 hours from the time I deposited the cash in their bank account to get my coins and the second time about 10 hours. The five percent fee isn&#039;t too bad compared to some other places but I wish it was lower, haha. I would definitely recommend them, other than bitcoin-otc this is easily the fastest way to get BTC on short notice.

				I used them for the second time in 3 weeks. I used the cash by mail option which imo is the easiest way to get bitcoins. I know the cash deposit at the bank is quicker but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as safe or reliable; I&#039;ve read a lot of posts complaining about poor communication using this payment option. Anyway, this time I got my coins in 5 days, same as last time I used these guys. I don&#039;t see why people complain about them, as long as you know how to use their service it works flawlessly (at least in my experience). I give the cash by mail option my approval...

				Here&#039;s some interesting reading for everyone:<br /><br />http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/nov/01/student-startup-storms-cyberspace/<br /><br />As for the site.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had any real problems with them.&nbsp; My first order with them was a while ago (like October last year) was filled in less than two hours.&nbsp; Last time I used them it took about 3 days.&nbsp; Seems like volume is getting a bit much for them or new laws or something.&nbsp; Not a bad way to go by any means since it allows you to stay somewhat anonymous but the days of getting it right away from them seem to be gone.&nbsp; Still, reliability and waiting 3 days beats getting scammed by some BTC vendor here any day in my opinion.&nbsp; Just be patient with them, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll sort out any problems given the chance.

				think i mentioned it before but it seems to me that only a couple of people are involved with the site, maybe even 1 person. ive had no problems with bank deposits but sending in prepaid cards has been nothing but headaches, especially since you have to track them down. they won&#039;t come to you.

				I&#039;ve used their service on a few occasions, for smallish (tops in the $200 range) amounts. Always the branch deposit method at BoA, and I&#039;m satisfied with them. Shortest time was a couple hours, longest was approximately 12 hours. I exchanged a few inquiries beforehand, and the replies were quick and pleasant. They&#039;re alright by me!

				Pine, while I can see where you&#039;re coming from, I think another person working with him would probably increase our fees. If you are able to work within his limitations you will get the lowest possible fees. I&#039;d rather wait a minute than pay more. If anyone wants to pay more they can get them changed via SR at a higher fee. I like I said though, I feel ya. Good idea, if it could be implemented without a rates raise.

				yeah, their cash deposit rates are so much better than any of the btc exchangers on SR that waiting a few extra hours seems really worth it. from what i understand though, theres been some backlogging on guys like BTCbuddy or SugarMama so maybe thats the way its gonna be from now on and it would be worth checking this site out. i&#039;ve had 2 successful deposits with them but then sent in some gift cards. now this site is playing games saying they didn&#039;t get them even though i have dc#. just be ready for this place to take the money and run on anything except for cash deposits.

				yeah, they aren&#039;t bad but not the most reliable you&#039;re right.. i&#039;ve asked them to change an address to send the coins to as i lost my instawallet address right after a deposit stating i believed my old address to be comprimised, they responded sure, we&#039;ll put that in the system for you. 8 hours later they send me a conformation saying we&#039;ve delivered your bitcoins thanks- checked my acct and low and behold- nothing.<br /><br />I followed up -respectfully- telling them they messed up bad and i&#039;m out $X because of their clerical error and they should refund some of my money. After a few times of not responding a few days and saying things like yes, we usually suggest that people put in a new application when a change of address is needed (which it said no where on the site- until now as i told them they should put it there) they ended up just refunding me their fee of 5%. <br /><br />Pissed me off pretty bad, particularly all the waiting and wondering about refunds..but hey, i made the mistake in the first place so i was just as much at fault.<br /><br />Anyway, they&#039;re alright dudes just proceed with a bit of caution..

				I have used them about 5 times and each deposit took no more than 24 hours after it had cleared.&nbsp; This past order is now going on almost a week and they say that is takes a few days (even though it never has taken that long in the past).&nbsp; Just want people to be aware that they&#039;re unreliable in terms of how long it takes for the coins to be in your account, as I suppose I got spoiled the first couple transactions when it only took hours.

				I used them today. This was my very first BTC purchase, so I only exchanged a small amount of money (nothing I couldn&#039;t stand losing).<br /><br />I used the cash deposit at BofA method. I mailed them the deposit slip (scanned - scrubbed of metadata) at 2:30. I got the &quot;received and processing&quot; email at 5:11, and a following saying they sent the coins at 10:18 (Including a link to blockexplorer.com showing the transfer, which was a nice touch.)<br /><br />One slight complaint was that I needed more information than what was provided by their website. They gave an account# and account name, but because the deposit was out of state I also needed an address. Luckily the teller just filled out the address from the account# information, but I don&#039;t know what I could have done if the woman refused to make the deposit since I didn&#039;t have the address.<br /><br />But altogether a quick, painless experience. I will use them again. I might try the Chase account next for comparison.

				My Review is positive. I came across some old gift cards that I figured would still have money in them, so I made an order on get-bitcoin, put the cards in an envelope with some note paper giving the order number and amount on each card. Took 4 days to get there and then the Coin was in my wallet. No issues whatsoever. The three percent surcharge didn&#039;t really affect it too much. I left maximum price blank as well. I sent out another order Monday, still waiting on that one to get in.

				I&#039;ve used get-bitcoin for at least 5 transactions before today. They were all under $500 dollar deposits and within 24 hours I would receive my coins. I emailed their cutty rep last night and asked if their little &#039;crisis&#039; has been diverted yet, and if it was safe for me to deposit 900 dollars and have them process it. Within 15 minutes I got an email saying that the crisis is almost over, and that anything under 1000 will be processed fine and dandy.<br /><br />Anyway, deposited the cash this morning, and have not received any reply or email since then. I might just be prematurely bugging out, but I really cannot afford to be 900 in the negatives. First time I&#039;ve ever had problems with their service.

				I got a confirmation email, 6 hours after sending them the receipt via email.<br />Someone named Hannah has been emailing me instead of Alicorn, their usual cutty rep.<br />Hopefully all is well, my BTC orders usually got processed at 4 or 5 in the AM. <br /><br />Guess it&#039;s time to smoke a few bowls of Kara&#039;s sweet tooth, and look for other btc vendors!

				Same here. I slept in today, expecting to have my coins in my wallet. I have a little under a grand floating around with them, first time I&#039;ve ever had a problem with their services, and will absolutely be the last time that I use their services. I forget which service I was using before, but they shut their doors down and get-bitcoin was te closest service that didn&#039;t seem that dodgy. <br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed hannah and the other cutty rep several times, and it&#039;s officially now outside the 24 hour window. Check out their thread on bitcoin talk forum from their page, seems like several other people are in our boat as well.

				yea im fucking pissed to. yesterday at 9 i made a deposit for a small amount at chase and sent them a pic of my reciept and didnt get an email back from them till bout 6 pm which was odd because they usually confirm payment within an hour. i had to send them 4 emails asking if they recieved my payment yet before i got there response. tody its 1 pm and still no bitcoins. and who the fuck is this hanna bitch? i want alicorn back she at least would give rapid responses to my emails. if get bitcoin goes down whats similiar to this site? i used to use tradehill but them fuckers closed down and kept 12 dollars of my money. i was reading that if mt gox goes down then thats the end of bitoin cause then bits will be valueless if u cant exchange em for currency. so say a prayer mt gox dont go the way of all these other companies. i just want my fucking bits damnit!!

				I finally got a response with a little bit of sustenance. According to &quot;hannah&quot;, they are having trouble moving coins into the account they use to buy coins. She says the account isn&#039;t completely zero so this should allow small orders to go through. I guess we shall see. I&#039;m never sending them a large amount of money again. That&#039;s for sure.

				i just recieved an email bout an hour ago from hanna in response to a nasty email i sent this morning saying theres a lack of communication and alot of pissed off customers on message boards and asking who hanna is and where is alicorn. the response i got was hanna is alicorn alicorn was her screename but people were not recieving emails from that email address but she using another email address and hanna is her real name, she also stated that there having a hiccup on there end and are trying to work it out and get caught up with the orders. my order is an extremely small one of only 10 bitcoins so the excuse that there onlyh having trouble with larger orders doesnt seem legitamate to me. time will tell if they get on the ball or not. it would suck if they went out of buisness as this was a very convienient way to get bits quickly and annonymously

				I finally got a reply. The &#039;crisis&#039; that they had has not been fixed as expected, and they&#039;re doing everythin to fix it and catch up on orders. Everyone&#039;s money/bitcoins are in the queue waiting to be processed.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure everyone, on every message board, who is having issues with get-bitcoin would feel a whole lot better if there was at least some semblance of communication without having to send 2 or 3 emails and then waiting 12 or more hours for a response.<br /><br />For the people who have larger orders of 1k or more like myself, it gets a bit troubling when before the customer service would at least attempt to be prompt.

I lay some of the blame on Tony76- he is awesome and his sale flooded the market with requests. he may be responsible for a 1% to 2% jump in the cost of coins. <br /><br />We will be fine.

				Yeah I really have to get familiar with bit instant, just in case. I just don&#039;t like the fact that you have to use a 3rd exchanger, especially since Mt. Gox (and others too, likely) flag the accounts of tor users. Maybe I just don&#039;t know the right one to use.<br /><br />According to that bitcointalk review thread they link to on their home page, GBC&#039;s Chase deposits appear to be getting back to normal now: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=34812.40<br /><br />I&#039;ll email them prior to buying the coins early tomorrow, and cross my fingers from there. I really want to order bud and have it here by the weekend. GBC better come through in time for it to go out on Wednesday or at least Thursday :P

				Received a reply today, stating my order will be processed, but because the market price for bitcoins rose they won&#039;t fill my order until I tell them to raise my max price. I would be alright with it, if i hadn&#039;t ordered such a substantial amount, and with the 5% fee, and the price fluctuation, I&#039;m out 250 bucks so I&#039;m short on the order I wanted to place. <br /><br />All in all, I would probably not use their services again unless they really showed a vast improvement on their customer service and entire company system.

				For what it&#039;s worth, I decided to take a chance on another transaction today since my first one went so well. Used the cash deposit at Chase this time (was actually easier than at BoA).<br /><br />Received confirmation 90 minutes after emailing the deposit slip, and received fulfillment notice about 8 hours later. Not the 2 hour turnaround I got last time but well within 24 hours and still only at 5% fee.

				its a crap shoot with these people(thats plural cause they say they added more people but i don&#039;t believe them). every time i&#039;ve used deposit at their bank the btc was at my address withing 12 hours. after reading earlier posts in this thread i decided to skip BOA and went to Chase instead. 14 hours from deposit to my wallet. protect yourself if you decide to mail things to them. they seem to like to selective scam like some vendors on here have. if only there were more options that didn&#039;t rape you to get btc. DPR, i know you have it in you to create some currency designed specifically for SR use. there are plenty of people here that can help. maybe im too high think of all the cons right now.

You could call it SRCoin and just start a new blockchain. This would not eliminate any of the problems you are having getting coins.<br /><br />BTC are only valuable because of adoption. People are willing to buy them for an established currency (which is valued anywhere), therefor BTC have value. How many people would adopt SRCoin? Where you you exchange them for cash? What would stop the &quot;scams&quot; you&#039;ve already been dealing with?<br /><br />An exchange medium like BTC can only be used in a market if it has inherent value, which BTC does not, or value as an exchange medium outsite of the market, which BTC does. The idea of our own little currency is nice, but not at all plausible.<br /><br />And honestly, it&#039;s not that difficult to get coins. It&#039;s difficult to get them both cheaply and anonymously.

				I deposited 1k with them, took 6 days total to get my coins. They took their percentage and I still haven&#039;t received an email back after sending her 3 emails a day since then. They made me lose a chunk of change because of how long it took to process, and coin prices going up.<br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed Hannah with no avail, and have been asking to speak to her admin.

				Ever since Tradehill went down, they have been hit or miss. <br /><br />I do the cash deposit at Chase and always CC everything to all 4 email addys. Hannah, Alicorn, orders, and support. I send them a scan in JPG and PDF format. The longest wait recently was 38 hours two weeks ago. But the week before that, had coins in 46 minutes.

				Sent in a money order on Saturday (actually shipped on Monday), got bitcoin Friday morning.<br />Takes a bit, but it is still pretty simple and as fast as a bank deposit. I think I will be giving wm-moneycenter my business now, having bitcoin within a couple hours is worth an extra $5 or so depending on how much you are buying. Right now I think they are still offering 0% fees for bitcoin, so you only have to pay the MG fee.

				I&#039;m new to SR and to bitcoins, but my experience reflects what&#039;s been in this thread so far pretty well.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Sent money using a prepaid debit card, but had to physically mail the card to them.&nbsp; So, this is solidly anonymous but no better in terms of not losing your money than mailing cash.<br />-They got payment late Monday and I got my bitcoins early Friday.&nbsp; Not the 24 hour window they promised, but based on reviews they seem pretty overwhelmed and they did post on Monday that cash payments might be delayed.&nbsp; I think it actually helped me because the bitcoin price went down slightly over those few days.<br />-I got a quick response confirming when I asked on Wednesday whether they had received my payment. <br /><br />So the summary is that I&#039;m happy, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend it unless you&#039;re willing to be patient for a few days.&nbsp; Looking at the complaints here and on the bitcoin forum, it&#039;s clear that the &quot;within 24 hours or we&#039;ll refund your fee&quot; bit is not working, but I haven&#039;t seen a single person say that they never got paid at all.&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;m never in a huge hurry and the service was smooth, easy to use, and anonymous, so I&#039;d use them again unless something better crops up.

Other than that, there&#039;s no linking to me, wouldn&#039;t be unthinkable to deposit directly from mtgox into SR account...<br /><br />Might try one of the SR vendors with the cash cards (BTC Buddy seems reputable).

				It is recommended that you transfer to a wallet online or via bitcoin client application installed on your computer. Then you can xfer through other wallets or online services like bit fog ( I think that is the name) to increase anonymity.&nbsp; Once transferred to your SR account the coins will also be tumbled to increase anonymity.&nbsp; And you are done.

				I processed a WU wire. I think could have possibly been the biggest delay I guess. It was just odd that nothing happened until 2 days AFTER they received the money. Maybe next time I will try bank deposit. You really don&#039;t need an ID when making a deposit to a bank? Even in my own state with my OWN account they still ask for an ID here. They are ID happy in this state, so I&#039;m guess if I try to make a deposit with someone else&#039;s account they surely will ask for ID, blood type, height, weight and even body fat percentage.<br /><br />

No communication for 2 or 3 days, and FINALLY got the BTC after me sending them an email where I passive-aggressively said I hope they&#039;re no selective scamming me. <br />They say it&#039;s guaranteed 24 hour turnaround, but it would be more accurate for them to state &quot;SOMETIMES it&#039;s within 24 hours&quot;<br />If you scroll back a few pages, you will see people saying they&#039;ve been selectively scammed.<br /><br />I really wish there was another method that was fast, easy, and had similar decent fee to use (get-bitcoins 3% fee is not bad at all, considering there are some SR btc traders that I swear have lost their damn minds with their fees and BTC selling rate) <br /><br />anyway, good luck!

				Get-Bitcoin is the best place to buy bitcoins if your favorite exchanger is out on Silk Road. I havent heard of Get-BitCoin ripping anyone off or doing anything shady. The worst I hear is that people complain because the value of bitcoins went up and they got less. I understand that they are sad for getting less but I think its wrong to blame it on Get-BitCoin unless he took an exceptionally long time.

				How long does it usually take when mailing them a prepaid card? Been 6 days now so I am not to worried but I found it odd that after my order confirmation it just said to mail them the card.

Already include the order number in your envelope, because of your thought process above.<br /><br />If you did not do either of these, please contact support. You may end up having to place another order with a name matching the return address for them to match the card with.

				Well I was gonna use them but decided it against it after they emailed me this when I asked if they were experiencing any delays, Hanna said, <br /><br />&quot;Hannah, Apr 18 17:15 (EDT):<br /><br />Chase and Bank of America are no longer giving us problems. If turnaround<br />time is a priority for you, it might be best to wait a day or two to place<br />your order; we&#039;re experiencing a small hiccup with Mt. Gox which affects<br />all orders, although so far they have not become late as a result, but we<br />expect to resolve it soon. We apologize for any inconvenience.&quot;<br /><br />so I&#039;m going a different direction, just that I&#039;d post that if your trying to get your btc&#039;s ready for the sales on 4/20, I know I am :D

Sorry for asking that much questions, but i&#039;m quite a noob to this and a bit insecure. :S<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Sure it about the most anon way to do it, imo. I think they ask for ID or similar for amounts over $1000, but there&#039;s no need to give them anything other than a fake name and return address otherwise. I think it took about 5 days total? I wouldn&#039;t trust my memory too much though&nbsp; ;) Also, while I&#039;ve had perfect luck with cash in the mail, there is always the risk...

				Get-Bitcoin sucks!!! Somethings wrong when your more nervous about whether or not you will receive your coins then if your ILLEGAL SCHEDULED SUBSTANCES will show up on your DOORSTEP lmao! The first couple times I used them it only took about a day r two to process my order from the time of receiving my letter in the mail (I use prepaid debit cards, you have to physically send them. Also the fee is jacked up to 8%.), the last time I used them (about a 10 days ago) my letter arrived (I purchased DCN) 5/04/2012, it was sent 5/02/2012, and they FINALLY got around to it after the many emails I sent to there ONE person support staff (FUCK YOU HANNAH) it was 5/08/2012. No bullshit, it took them 4 days to process my order!!! 24-Hour turnaround guarantee my ASS! In the whole time I have been using Get-Bitcoin (Basically for the lack of other sites that accept prepaid Visa debit) they have only completed my order in a reasonable time twice...They actually told me that USPS lies about when they deliver items and that it&#039;s not there fault whatsoever. I have yet to receive a refund of fee&#039;s from any of the times they have taken longer than 24-Hours. And I&#039;m a reasonable person, if it was once or twice I could of cared less. But like I said before, when it gets to the point where you get anxiety about whether or not they will credit your coins...<br /><br />Funny how things work out. I remember back when reading on these exact forums about how good Get-Bitcoin is and how quick they are, myself included (I know I reviewed them after my first order and it was literally the exact opposite of this review lol). Even now reading the forums and even this thread, the whole attitude towards them has changed. <br /><br />I can only speak about using prepaid Visa Debit Cards to purchase the coins, I have not used any other of the options on there site. And I will not be using them, after this last experience I swore to myself that I would never use there site again no matter what.<br /><br />Fuck Get-Bitcoin.com, the dudes raking in the money charging a base fee of 5% and can&#039;t even run a quality business. I&#039;m waiting for the day when whoever runs that site dips out with all the money from all the orders he&#039;s getting and just disappears. They try to sound official with the LLC, I can buy one of those for $500, all that means is the you cannot sue them for any reasons. Releases them from liability. <br /><br />~|xXShadowXx|~

				Maybe it&#039;s paranoia but my rationale is to break up the transaction and transfer it to SR as multiple smaller transactions and changing the Tor network identity each time.&nbsp; &nbsp;The transaction &quot;looks&quot; completely different from the original Get-Bitcoin to personal wallet transfer.&nbsp;

				Hmm. I have just figured out (or at least have a vague idea) how purchasing BTCs on regular sites work, and now I&#039;ll have to go for something else :/ <br />I really don&#039;t have an idea how this works. How can you pay them then on SR if BTCs are the only currency that work? Also, don&#039;t they then immediately show up in your SR-wallet, which is kind of unsafe? Maybe there&#039;s already some information about this anywhere..?<br />Edit: Okay, so apparently I need a Moneypak-Account or something. No idea either how this works, but do I have to access that website via tor or is it risky via clearnet?

				I had some transactions that went perfect, coin within 4-6 hours. But when it did not go good it was really really bad. Hard to get a response. When I did it was very vague and &quot;sorry we do not know what happened&quot;. Took weeks to get, and did not get service fee refunded as advertised. Very stressful time. <br /><br />I will not use them again because of this horrible time. If they were quick to respond and give at least an idea on when it would be resolved it would have been better and I would have been patient. Instead they said &quot;we do not know when we will find out what happened, we need to give to the supervisor and he is very busy&quot; . Unacceptable. <br /><br />Due to this I will be using a vendor in SR, the extra fee will be worth it.

Now, when you submit the order form online you will receive a confirmation email as normal, however, no you also need to wait for the email from trustcash. SAVE YOUR GET-BITCOIN TRANSACTION NUMBER. Once you&#039;ve received that email, go to your nearest BoA (not the one they tell you to go to) and deposit into the account, making sure to note the different account number and the state the account was opened in. The amount you deposit will be slightly different, ie, if you want to deposit 200 USD you&#039;ll deposit 201.18. This is so they can ID your transaction faster and get your money quicker. Once you deposit, you&#039;ll receive an email from coinapult, trustcash, as well as get-bitcoin (I think). From there, you just go to the coinapult link they email you, and put in the BTC address you want the coins to go to, and the last 4 digits of the transaction number get-bitcoin gave you.

The thing that I walked away with from our convo is that other than that they suck donkey dick.<br />Held sell orders - long waits to sell coins - long waits for checks in mail and plenty of excuses.<br />Now they merged with Bit Instant so there r two ass hats now?<br />Prolly like two peas in a pod.<br /><br />Glad I dont have to deal!!!<br /><br />Oh yea - he told me about some other guys that were out 6 grand for like 2 months - but thats on another forum<br />and i didn&#039;t actually read it, although I don&#039;t believe he has any reason to make something like that up.<br /><br />There are other bitcoin vendors - i would say use them first!!

				I was a big GetBitcoin fan for awhile but after a few really good experiences with BitInstant, my loyalties have changed.&nbsp; My last order was submitted at 10:00 a.m., over to Coinapult almost immediately after I sent the deposit invoice.&nbsp; Then, on to my personal wallet.&nbsp; Money was on SR in just a few hours from initial order.&nbsp; And incidentally the vendor, ShowWerks, had the package in the mail (Priority) right away.&nbsp; I think it was very close to 48 hours from making the cash deposit to product in hand.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t do that with Get-Bitcoins.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quickest transaction to date in 30+ orders.<br /><br />Just my experience.

				Hi all,<br /><br />Just wanted to throw in a good word for canadianbitcoins.com, they&#039;re the only guys I use these days (via Western Union transfer) - very helpful, very quick, and always have my coins within an hour or two of sending the money. They pick up once or twice a day I think (so you can time the money transfer to make sure you get your coins asap) and when you fill out the online form to buy they lock in the price shown for 3 hours. Rate is in Canadian dollars so do what you have to do to change that into your own currency! Be sure to use Western Union&#039;s money transfer calculator to see how much they&#039;ll actually pay out though, because W.U.&#039;s exchange rates can differ from banks and online tools etc.<br /><br />In short I&#039;ve always been more than happy with their service, so figured I&#039;d throw up here as an alternative to Get-Bitcoin, whom I&#039;ve had nothing but trouble with.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Months earlier, I claim that this business was the best.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />After depositing about $600, I did not receive my funds.&nbsp; They changed something.&nbsp; The best way to describe it is that they &quot;outsource&quot; the work, so I suppose they are brokers doing nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />After 24 hours, I started firing off polite emails.&nbsp; Three days later and pissed off, I revealed my profession and got serious and described the ramifications for breach of contract.&nbsp; Of course, the &quot;CEO&quot; from the outsource people wrote me, and I had coin within 30 minutes. <br /><br />Disappointing because this was such an easy method that the fees never bothered me. <br /><br />Oh yes, I did make an error, so they are not 100% culpable.&nbsp; Still, a fuck up of this magnitude will not receive my business.... scary, lol.
