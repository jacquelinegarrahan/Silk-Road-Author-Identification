				I realize I&#039;m probably the last person to make the connection where it clearly says there are problems with SR receiving btc from Virwox on the Account part. However.<br /><br />--Virwox SUCKS. Don&#039;t use them. They&#039;re listed as a vendor to use for Bitcoins here, so I thoguht they&#039;d be faster.<br />--Was charged a fee to send funds via Paypal. <br />--Then charged a fee to convert to their &quot;SLL&quot; funds <br />--Then charged a fee to convert to &quot;BTC&quot;<br />--Then will be charged another fee to send the BTC to SR.<br /><br />Hopefully, when all is said and done, I might have .0002 BTC left!

				While VirWox does cost more than using the dwolla route, you save the 3 or so days that you would otherwise have to wait if you&#039;re coming directly from a bank account.&nbsp; When I need funds ASAP, it&#039;s still the way I go.&nbsp; Instead of using PayPal though, I use MoneyBrookers with a pre-paid VISA card.<br /><br />If you&#039;re getting more than just one or two bitcoins, it isn&#039;t really all that bad.&nbsp; On average, after all the conversion fees I end up paying about $16/bitcoin there where dwolla --&gt; mt. gox usually costs me around $14/bitcoin (this is an average over the past month).<br /><br />In addition, as others have mentioned, you don&#039;t want to try sending directly from virwox to your SR account.&nbsp; Go through either a bitcoin wallet on your computer or an online one with mybitcoin.com or somewhere else.&nbsp; When using this method, I can have funds into SR in under an hour, usually.&nbsp; Longest it&#039;s taken is 3.<br /><br />Edit: Just remembered that my first BitCoin withdrawl from virwox DID take 48 full hours.&nbsp; I was not a happy camper.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done 10 transactions since then and all of them have been much speedier.

				Yes, it&#039;s my first transaction with them, and I&quot;m not a happy camper (waiting on the 48 hours for them to send to my wallet) - I normally go through Mt Gox. Care to lend me 5 btc till that time is up?&nbsp; ::) LOLOLOLOLOOL

				My first transaction took 48 hours to withdraw. Second one not sure at least 18 hours.<br /><br />I swore after the first one I wouldn&#039;t use them again, but when you need bitcoins fast it seems like it&#039;s worth the fees, until you are stuck waiting on the withdrawal!

				I&#039;ve found a way to buy bitcoins and get them sent to my personal wallet in a matter of hours. LEss anonymity, of course. But, it works, and of course, I don&#039;t buy or sell ANYTHING illegal. ;) ;)<br /><br />Aside from that, once they&#039;re tumbled, can&#039;t trace em back to how I purchased them anyhoo!
