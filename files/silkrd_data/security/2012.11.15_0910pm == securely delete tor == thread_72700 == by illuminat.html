				does anyone know a program that can completely delete all traces of tor on a hard drive, I have wiped my free space with three different programs and have been shredding tor recently but when I search for files to recover a couple of files show up like vidalia and tor, torbutton etc.

				The only way to securely delete information from a hard drive is something similar to DBAN.&nbsp; Google.

				I use a DOS based program called Killdisk (www.killdisk.com) .&nbsp; It&#039;s free to use for 1 pass zeroes.&nbsp; But if you want to do more than that, it costs around $40 .

				At one point I had CCleaner, Eraser, and File Shredder, and I remember having to go through all three of them at one point in order to remove all traces of the files themselves, not just their contents. (I checked my work with EnCase...there are better forensics programs out there now, I&#039;m sure.) Unfortunately, I don&#039;t remember which program finally got the job done.<br /><br />So it may be worth messing around with those before nuking your hard drive. Also, Tor isn&#039;t illegal. I think Tor is far less incriminating than Bitcoins, even though both are perfectly legal. But do what you gotta do!

				Next time you want to delete tor browser bundle encrypt it with impossible password and wipe it. Use full disc encryption anyways since you can delete all you want they can still theoretically find stuff especially if wear leveling device like ssd or usb stick
