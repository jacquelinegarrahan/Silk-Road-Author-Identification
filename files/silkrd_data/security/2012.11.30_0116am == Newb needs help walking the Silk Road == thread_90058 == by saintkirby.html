				Hello everybody!<br />I&#039;m new around here and am still trying to get the hang of this whole Tor, deep web, crypto-anarchy business. So far it&#039;s been a blast!<br />I&#039;ve yet to make my first purchase, as I&#039;ve come across a dilemma with transferring funds while staying anonymous.<br />Today, I made the effort to purchase BTCs through the use of mtgox, bitinstant, and moneygram. The problem is that I had to supply ID, name, address when I was using moneygram. I&#039;ve transferred the funds to an instawallet on the clearnet. This all took place in my public library.<br />I created a blockchain.info wallet through tor. Is it okay to access my instawallet through the clearnet and send the funds to that blockchain wallet?<br />I&#039;d figured if anyone was tracking me, they&#039;d only notice that I&#039;d sent the funds to an obscure location on the planet. From there, I plan to transfer it to my SR account.<br /><br />Another thing, I&#039;ve been using liberte linux from a USB. I&#039;ve been hearing talk that it&#039;s not really secure, and that I&#039;m better off switching to ubuntu/linux.<br />Any thoughts on this? <br /><br />Your wisdom and help is greatly appreciated!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				I read somewhere on the Liberte Linux discussion portals that it was prone to malware attacks, and that people would be better off just switching to Linux and booting Tor off a USB. <br />I appreciate the response Guru. I feel safer now!<br /><br />How&#039;s my transferring setup? You think it&#039;s alright?<br />Also, does downloading through Tor on Liberte Linux compromise my anonymity?

				I simply copied the link from the Security Sub-Forum and pasted it for the member, who wanted some information. That&#039;s it.
