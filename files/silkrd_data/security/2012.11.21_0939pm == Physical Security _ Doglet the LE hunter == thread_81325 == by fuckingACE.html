				Hi.<br /><br />Ok so here&#039;s the story of Doglet *not his real name* and the Gypsies. Basically the area where I used to live is notorious for having slums in which gypsies live and carry out their nefarious activities. One night last year one of their shacks was raided by LE, The piggy in questions recounting of the events was quite funny. He was the first one through the door and was confronted by a 75 kilo, snarling very very angry Great Dane, It took a whole spray can of pepper spray and 3 fully grown cops to pull *doglet* of the unfortunate fucker that was in the front of the queue to raid the house.. I can only imagine how many stitches the piggy would have needed to sow him back together after that fateful encounter... Anyway, I love dogs of all kinds and used to help out at an animal shelter for doggies, coincidentally the one that doglet would end up going to when the magistrate declined to have him put down. Because doglet had only attacked *the intruder* within the confines of the house that he was guarding the magistrate applied some common sense and leeway and allowed poor doglet to live. Most other magistrates would have just ordered him put down, personally I believe that this was fate.. <br />So I come in one morning and sitting in a new kennel is a very scary looking doglet, I totally fall in love with him and within a month he comes home with me. I decided to do some research into the case and apparently when questioned about the dog the Gypsy gave away the secret. Apparently when doglet was a puppy these gypises would on a regular basis creep into their own houses at night dressed as LE covered in aftershave and beat the fuck out of the dogs with police batons... They did this on a regular enough basis that eventually the dogs realised that LE equals Lunch... Now, doglet isn&#039;t a dog I can take out with me on walks,, If he sees LE he would most likley devour it without a seconds notice sooooo. <br /><br />I have two questions... <br /><br />Can anyone see any inconveniences to me getting doglet a stash collar and keeping my usual in house stash on him? It&#039;s guaranteed no one will be able to get to it spesh LE..<br /><br />If LE raided whilst I wasn&#039;t in and doglet ended up seriously fucking up a piggy what are the legal ramifications? I think it was pure chance doglet got away with it last time and I want something better to go on than just luck... Since then I have passed the dangerous dog owner exam and doglet has been evaluated as safe within a confined area. I love him lots and I would be broken if he got put down.. The fact of It taking place on my property and all? Obv I havn&#039;t trained him to act in that way, there are caution signs up everywhere and doglet is well known around here.. Could I be held responsible in any way? after all doglet is just doing his job, keeping the outside world out..

				They DO NOT care. They will shoot your dog and take the collar off. Sorry to say it, but it&#039;s what would happen in real life.

				They&#039;re not armed in this country... and from what I&#039;ve heard hitting doglet with a police baton really only makes him more angry . I guess what they might do is hear him bark and come back with a tranquiliser gun

				Hard to say for sure for your local laws, but if there are signs up warning of the dangerous dog, and they go in there while you are not home, chances are it&#039;s on them.&nbsp; You can say you made all efforts to keep the dog contained, they ignored warnings, etc.&nbsp; If they are smart if they want to raid you they would wait for you to come home and require that you contain your dog.&nbsp; Then if you did not it would be on you.

				Not to get off topic. But your country is insane. No guns? how do you guys fight bad guys with guns?<br /><br />Do you have to call in for armed assistance? I cant imagine having a gun fight without a gun.. just spray and baton?

Stupid i know... If armed assistance is required they call in SO19 the armed response guys... Apparently they can get there pretty quick. I think the theory behind it is that if no one has guns then the bad guys are less likely to need&amp;have&amp;want them.. Fuck knows, theres still lots of people getting shot though,, so apparently not working<br />ACE

Otherwise it makes you sound like you&#039;re speaking form personal experience..
