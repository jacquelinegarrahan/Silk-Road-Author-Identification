				A competitor probably who wants to drive traffic to his service with spam by causing chaos here. Don&#039;t know why DPR doesn&#039;t limit posts of new accounts, nor why he doesn&#039;t pay his mods here to whitelist accounts instead of just letting bots spam to 50 posts and then flood the board.<br /><br />DPR needs to learn from Russian and CIS carding forums. Russians would split income to pay permanent mods to do 24/hr watch on the site whitelisting members, responding to support, banning idiots and suppressing spam. Since this is Tor, and you can&#039;t ban by IP what DPR should be doing is slow banning usernames, that super annoying denial of service method a lot of sites use now. Instead of an outright &quot;You are banned for being a fucktard&quot; message you get 502/503 error messages, pages take forever to load, and basically you are denied access to the site but not outright told to go fuck yourself, that way idiots usually just give up, or bots get lost in the dark pit of shitposting denial of service hell. This is easy to implement too<br /><br />

				another solution: crowdsourced oversight. allow the users of SR to suspend an account. would need whitelisted accounts to prevent people from making spam accounts to misuse their power. if more than, say an arbitrary number of 10 whitelisted accounts, votes within a 10 minute period to &quot;mute&quot; a user.. said user&#039;s account will be disabled.

				it&#039;s pretty easy to implement a slow ban in SMF, plenty of other sites do. If X user makes &lt;Y posts in &gt;Z time period slow ban them with timeout and 503 errors.

				comsec: that&#039;s because you got past 100 posts. Congratulations, you graduated! :)<br /><br />Even better is a hellban. If someone posts too often or in a certain pattern, their posts become invisible to regular users, but they don&#039;t know it. Makes them waste a lot of time.<br />

				Some of these names have been ripped from old posts on Spam.com(I used a search engine through TOR and looked up a couple.) which were subsequently deleted, post was from APRIL some crap about pakistanis, I&#039;m not going into the details, but if you search the boston, MA, one that came up, it was in there.&nbsp; There were also links to topix drug-boards and other shit on there, so we know that whoever it is, is a fucking lowlife troll, without any pertinent information.&nbsp; They would have posted more than 13 addresses if they had them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know where they got this list- it could have been evidence in a court case against a vendor, used in a legal brief(accessible to anyone.)&nbsp; Just thought that might help put this into perspective.&nbsp; I trust my vendors on SR 99.99999%, but I&#039;m pretty careful about where I stick my address.

				Here is a better solution.<br /><br />Why not implement some code into the forums that basically censors posts if it includes addresses?&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not hard to compile a database of zip codes.&nbsp; If a post contains a zip code and a state abbreviation, for example, it gets hidden from public view. <br /><br />There should be no reason why any post here needs to have an address anyway, right?&nbsp; <br /><br />Furthermore, let the poster see the post from their account but hide it from everyone else.&nbsp; That way the spammer thinks they are still getting their post seen but in reality it&#039;s hidden from everyone, and they won&#039;t try to work around it.<br /><br />I realize this is a bit of work but I think SR would agree it needs to be dealt with better than via a whack-a-mole approach.

				IDK, the whole thing is strange to me. <br /><br />infowars posted addresses in a thread where I had first noticed his posts and said something about it.&nbsp; then the infowars post got deleted and my post was just dangling there out of context. then, just after I wrote something repling to someone who misunderstood my out-of-context post (a day or so later), infowars posted more addresses in that same thread and not any others. By the time I noticed, I also saw it was posted as a Guest. (still there as of now). <br /><br />Not that much time passed between when I posted my reply and when i saw the infowars Guest post. I guess its possible they deleted the account and haven&#039;t gotten to deleting the post with the addresses in question yet since they have to delete them 1 by 1.<br /><br />Its just weird&nbsp; ???

				@bluedev1 -<br /><br />Do you know of any SMF scripts or mods that allow this? I don&#039;t think the software has a ghost posting / hellban option, so the second point would take some coding.&nbsp; I know there&#039;s a banned word feature, but not one that blocks only things formatted in a certain way. Maybe it wouldn&#039;t be that hard to modify tho.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t that sort of feature would get at the real issue tho. It wouldn&#039;t stop someone from posting any names/addresses somewhere outside SR and just announcing that on the forum. I think a standard spam-block (those that automatically lock the accounts of users who&#039;s activity is spammy - ie. posting the same or nearly the same content across different boards in a short amount of time) would be just as effective &amp; would help with other forms of spam too.&nbsp;
