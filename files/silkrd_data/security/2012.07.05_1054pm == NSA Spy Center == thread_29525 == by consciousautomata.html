				I read that article a month or so ago.&nbsp; It mentions in the article that this new center will be used in part to break encryption schemes.&nbsp; Does that mean they will be able to break GPG encryption?&nbsp; <br />Here is that part of the article:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But “this is more than just a data center,” says one senior intelligence official who until recently was involved with the program. The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes. And code-breaking is crucial, because much of the data that the center will handle—financial information, stock transactions, business deals, foreign military and diplomatic secrets, legal documents, confidential personal communications—will be heavily encrypted. According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It&#039;s well known that the NSA provides a lot of the exit nodes (essentially servers) for Tor. It&#039;s not even hidden or some big magical secret... <br /><br />When you connect to Tor and see the &quot;Visible IP&quot; it first shows you, you can sometimes backtrace it using trace websites to well known NSA data-centers. <br /><br />It was afterall the US Army and Norwegian Army that made Tor in the first place... It&#039;s no reason to freak out though, just because they know whats going on here doesn&#039;t mean they know who the end user is i.e. you sat at your desk, that&#039;s the whole point of Tor, it&#039;s like several layers of an Onion.

				I suspect the NSA doesn&#039;t really care who&#039;s using Tor to buy drugs anyway. I don&#039;t think they can break RSA (the algorithm that GPG uses), as long as you use a sufficiently strong key (2048 bits or better). Security experts such as Bruce Schiner also agree. Although who knows, if they could break RSA, they&#039;re sure as fuck not going to tell anyone
