				They wrote a blog post about it the last time it went down:<br /><br />https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-check-outage-03-and-04-july-2013<br /><br />&quot;Over the past 24 hours https://check.torproject.org has been unavailable due to excessive DNS queries to the exitlist service. It seems there are a number of individuals and companies with commercial products relying upon this volunteer service. We finally hit the point where we couldn&#039;t keep up with the queries and simply disabled the service.<br /><br />This is a volunteer service offered as a proof of concept. We strongly encourage people to run their own. The code is available at https://svn.torproject.org/svn/check/trunk/.<br /><br />The new Tor Browser 3.0 alpha series includes a new way to detect &quot;tor or not&quot; locally, without relying on a single point of failure service. This is the first step towards finally retiring check.torproject.org for good.<br /><br />As of 09:00 on 04 July 2013, the service is re-enabled. We reserve the right to take it down as needed without notice.&quot;<br /><br /><br />As always, if you&#039;re on a hidden service, Tor is working for you. :)<br />
