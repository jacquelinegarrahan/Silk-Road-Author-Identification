				Rather simple question: has anyone experienced a DEA bust or aware of their procedures? And if so, how thorough are their searches when it comes to outdoors? I placed my MDMA in two small ziplock bags surrounded by a dryer sheet inside of a medicine bottle and buried it inside of a pot outside. Will a drug dog be able to pick that scent up, or will it shake it off? I don&#039;t plan on going into the stash for another two months, so I assume once it rains and the soil settles it&#039;ll be a lot more secure. Or this could be a totally ignorant and far from worthwhile, but in any case, thought I&#039;d fish for everyone&#039;s opinion.

				Well other posts have shown that drug dogs can smell through 3 layers of vacuum sealed plastic after the product had been sealed for a certain time period.<br /><br />So lose soil probably wont help much. Also dogs dig up/bury bones all the time.

				Seems like a reasonable thing to do to lessen the chances of being caught after a simple search.&nbsp; Few people hide their drugs well.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got enough drug residue around the house to drive the dogs mad going this way and that lol.<br /><br />If I were paranoid I&#039;d probably put those plastic bags inside of a sealed glass bottle. Chemicals permeate through plastic.

				There is your answer mate, use a non permeable container e.g. glass and seal with something also non permeable and no odor will leach through irrespective of how long it is buried.

				you also need to make sure the container you bury will actually survive being underground for a long period of time. i have friends that have buried stuff and when they dug it up, everything was wet and ruined.

				One of those moisture absorber things wouldn&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure where to get those sealed and new.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t be needed if it is in a sealed non-permeable container though ... unless it is a drug that easily oxidizes or whatever but that would be a problem regardless of your hiding it.<br /><br />I need a good hiding spot, but I&#039;ve got shit all of the house and it sure as hell won&#039;t fit in a flowerpot lol.

				put it in a completely closed container that cant be leaked into, than stick it into a jar full of semi solid substance such as peanut butter. There is no way any smell will get through this.

				Now this may just be stoner logic/bro science but I&#039;ve been told that sniffer dogs have a harder time sniffing things that are higher up, eg I&#039;ve heard of people choosing the inner lining of the roof of there car because of this (when traveling with stuff on you), although I&#039;m pretty sure if you were being raided the first place the cops would look would be inside any crawl space/ roof/ attic, but I haven&#039;t really heard of putting a dog in a roof space before. Although, I&#039;m pretty sure, if they were at the point of having dogs around your house to check it out, your pretty much fucked. probably a good idea to have a story, and get it strait before you even get caught, even leaving around evidence for it. (although I am not speaking from experience, it&#039;s just I&#039;d do in that situation/ am currently doing now)

				I had the pigs come through my house with a dog many moons ago....&nbsp; <br />The fuzz had organised a whole heap of raids that morning at several addresses but only had one dog!&nbsp; <br />After the filth had a look around, we all sat down for a chat while we waited for the dog handler to come.....Took about 40 minutes to get there....&nbsp; Stoopid mutt went apeshit all over the house and then decided there was drugs hidden in a spot I new there was none.<br />&nbsp;They gave up after about 20 minutes but I ripped that part of the house to bits when they left just in case there was a stash I didn&#039;t know about....No such luck. <br />There was an open bag of weed in plain site which the dumb cunts nearly missed as they were totally relying on the dog (which also missed it) <br /><br />&quot;Look up and Live&quot;<br /><br /><br />

Then put that into some either well hidden, or inconspicuous location. <br /><br />Scents higher up being more difficult to detect would make sense, as scents tend to rise like hot air.<br /><br />Really though, keep your drugs in a place where nobody would ever stumble across them, and where (if found) they wouldn&#039;t incriminate you.<br /><br />Never store all your drugs in one place, multiple caches is always a good idea. (I&#039;m sure you already know this.)<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest transferring the drugs to a different location. Alternatively, you can put the pot under someone else&#039;s deck. Classic.<br /><br />Good luck, and happy crimes!<br /><br />- The Consultant

				An ex cop says in &quot;never get busted again&quot; that nothing is odor proof. Some materials just need more time to permeate out. But it always does eventually. Even when welded in a gas tank and the pipes also sealed. Or poured in concrete, also dont open your cardoor with a hand you just rolled a joint with, same applies to other surfaces or tools you use.<br />https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Never+Get+Busted+Again<br />There is a section in the vid about drug detection dogs, it will give you some answers. There also was a topic from someone who could acquirer a drug dog and tested various packaging and drugs.&nbsp;
