				Well due to certain circumstances I cannot make payment via cash deposit,so as a solution the vendor on Localbitcoins suggested that I transfer the money via online banking to his account<br /><br />My question now is can my account number be traced during the process by the vendor?<br /><br />Also are online transfers a safe measure for anonymity compared to Cash Deposits at the Local Bank/In-person<br /><br />love n light

				I would say an ACH transfer is not nearly as ideal as a cash deposit or payment since it would definitely allow tracing the deposit back to your account. But that&#039;s unlikely to happen unless somehow the BTC gets traced back to the seller, who then says, well I sold them to this cat on localbitcoin, then they trace it back to you through the ACH transfer. So maybe just tumble the BTC after receiving it from the guy on localbitcoin.<br /><br />Wheras with the cash deposit or payment, they wouldn&#039;t be able to track that back you, unless you got caught on camera and identified through facial recognition for example.
