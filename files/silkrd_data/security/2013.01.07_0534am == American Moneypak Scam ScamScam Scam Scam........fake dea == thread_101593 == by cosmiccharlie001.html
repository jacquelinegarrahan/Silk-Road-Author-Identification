You are just making shit up and saying hey I think this guy is dea because he stole my money. YOU should just say what you know, that he is a scammer. But now your saying dumb shit like saying this scammer is a cop, when the reality is they proably just stole your money and your mad. The sad part is you dont need 2 lie you can just say he is a scammer and every1 will hateh im on the forums because thats how they do lol. <br /><br />Now...as far as figuring out your information LOLZ. Honestly you didnt even give your information to buy&nbsp; the fucking MP so if they got your info is because you gave them it. lol
