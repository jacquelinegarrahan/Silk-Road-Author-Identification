				I am in the same boat right now, i did two bitinstant transactions today, one in the morning and one later in the afternoon, both for the same amount each. over 400$+. I have recieved one but i havn&#039;t recieved the other one yet, and it has been almost 8 hours since i recieved confirmation it was to be released, so i am quite unsure what to do, i havn&#039;t talked to anyone at this point.

				BitInstant has gone to shit recently. In the last few months their service has been basically 50/50 for me. Half the time it works as planned, half the time I&#039;m left waiting hours or days for the bitcoins.<br /><br />They always come through and correct the issue, but they are operating beyond their capacity apparently. I plan on using BitInstant again some time soon, but I&#039;m going to count on it taking a day or two to get the bitcoins. It just isn&#039;t the same as it once was.
