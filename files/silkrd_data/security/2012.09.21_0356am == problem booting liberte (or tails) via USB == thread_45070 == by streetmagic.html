				Hello. A little background first: I have a Samsung series 9 PC running windows 7. <br /><br />I am trying to boot via USB either Liberte or Tails, but anytime I do, my PC never boots. It just sits there on the very first screen when it&#039;s turned on (the one that says &quot;press f2&nbsp; for setup....&quot;), doing nothing, no error messages or anything. I have let it sit like that, and still nothing happens. I do not believe it is the USB, as I tested it on another computer, and it booted right up into the program. <br /><br />So I believe the error lies somewhere within my hardware or software configuration. I really would appreciate any help in figuring this out. Thanks for any info that anyone can provide.

				Yes, I have entered into the BIOS and set the boot order so it boots from USB first. Do you have any idea what may be done to fix this? Or is it a lost cause? I would really rather not have to buy a new PC, but if I must, it is what it is I suppose..

				Did you format your USB drive for FAT32 before you but Liberte on? Also, I remember there being a little installation on your normal operating system before you but it on to USB. I&#039;d try reinstalling and rereading the directions for installation.

				I guess I can just go buy a couple of different brands of USB and see if anything changes. I would boot from DVD, but my PC has no CD drive of any kind.

				Hi, I thought it was the right place to ask for help as I have problems booting my liberte liveusb.<br />I followed what John Keats explains in The Complete All-in-One Guide on How to Anonymously Use Silk Road:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Part 1: Creating your liveUSB<br /><br />1. Format the USB&nbsp; <br /><br />Find the icon for your USB in Windows Explorer. Right-click on it and select the &quot;Format&quot; option. Make sure the &quot;File System&quot; option is set to &quot;FAT32&quot;.<br />Hit &quot;Start&quot; and wait a few seconds for it to finish (time depends on capacity of flashdrive).<br /><br /><br />2. Install Liberte to USB&nbsp; <br /><br />Extract the &quot;.zip&quot; you just downloaded to the root of your USB flashdrive. Open the &quot;liberte&quot; folder, right-click over &quot;setup.bat&quot; and select &quot;Run as<br />administrator&quot;. The batch file will do its thing and will prompt you with a &quot;Press any key to continue...&quot; message once it&#039;s done.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> DONE<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. Boot from USB<br /><br />Now shut down your computer. To be able to boot from a USB flashdrive, you will have to change some settings in the BIOS. To access the BIOS, power-on<br />your computer and press whichever key is specified on your screen (usually something like &quot;Press F12 to access Boot menu...&quot;). Using the arrow keys,<br />scroll over to the &quot;Boot&quot; tab. Scroll down to the option &quot;USB HDD: YOUR USB&#039;s NAME HERE&quot; and move it to the top of the list. Save changes and exit.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; DONE<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. Using Liberte<br />The first time you boot Liberte will be really slow because it has to create an encrypted key for you. The loading bar will stop at about 3/4ths of the way,<br />pause for around 10 minutes, then you&#039;ll be prompted to enter a password for your system, at which point a hash will be generated for the password<br />which could also take around 10 minutes. Just sit tight, you&#039;ll be able to use your new configuration very soon.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then I can,t get to step 4. I save and exit and my screen went black with just a white cursor&nbsp; on the left bottom. After a long time (i hoped it was installing and not bugging) I shut down the computer and restarted it. The Liberte Linux Boot Menu appears. At the bottom it says that it will boot in 5, 4; etc seconds. I let it do and it starts doing its things but stop and I have a total black screen. I had to restart it again (press power button a few seconds). The LIberte Linux Menu appears again and this time I selected Hard Disk 2 and press enter. It blocks again ang give me the black screen.<br />I don&#039;t know what to do ?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading the forum for a while now and cant find answer.<br />Also Ive read about TAILS so Im now downloading tails and think installing it to the usb.<br />Don&#039;t I need to boot first the usb and then install tails under liberte linux?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure to totally get it but I&#039;m sure i&#039;ll get there. Any help/information would be great.<br />Thanx<br /><br />
