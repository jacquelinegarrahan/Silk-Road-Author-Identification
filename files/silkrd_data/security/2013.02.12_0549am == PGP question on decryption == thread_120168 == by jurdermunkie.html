				I have suddenly become unable to decrypt messages. I keep getting &quot;clipboard&quot; cointained no open pgp data. I have tested it several times and worked fine but I have a few I cannot decrypt. What is the cause of this or maybe something I overlooked. Thanks for ANY help.

Do you have an actual encrypted PGP message (including the &quot;-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----&quot; and &quot;-----END PGP MESSAGE-----&quot;) in the program&#039;s clipboard when it happens? If you do, then maybe whoever encrypted it isn&#039;t using OpenPGP-compliant encryption or the message got corrupted.<br /><br />BTW, deja vu here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99773.msg701051#msg701051&nbsp; :P

				More than a month later he still has this problem, because he never came back to read his own thread.<br /><br />It would be really useful if you told us which PGP program you&#039;re using.<br />

				Wow pardon me then. Never understood people who are willing to help but come off with asshole comments like that. Making whoever asked a simple question feel like a piece of shit for doing so.<br /><br />Thanks Mario! This has happened before and was just wondering what may be some common problems is all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Astor I thank you also for the other time. Ever had anything slip your mind? I did and my apologies for not thanking you sooner. I had person resend the message and it worked fine. Only trouble I have had is with the sender and whatever they did. Making sure it wasn&#039;t me is all.<br /><br />Spent almost 2 weeks in hospital right after that post. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. So you make arrogant comment not having a clue as to why I may have asked again.

				Damn, jurder, you&#039;re a bit sensitive.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about your health problems, but I didn&#039;t criticize you or anything. I literally just pointed out exactly what happened.<br /><br />Chill mate.<br />

				Its ok astor! I am quick to speak my mind so I can see why you would think I am sensitive but actually I&#039;m not. If it came across that way my apologies. I will give reason for my quick snap. Your choice of wording created a tone for me. The tone read like you were talking to Mario like I wasn&#039;t in the room so to speak. Thats just how I took it. No worries broheim! Not in least bit mad.
