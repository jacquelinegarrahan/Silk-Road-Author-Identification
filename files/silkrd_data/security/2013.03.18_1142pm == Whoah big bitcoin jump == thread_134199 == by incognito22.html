				I guess the road goes by the weighted average.&nbsp; which is like $4 lower than what i get from bitcoinexchangerate.com<br /><br />still it looks like todays a big riser after settling at around $47 for a while

				I&#039;ve got about $650 coming in about 3 weeks, money I wasn&#039;t expecting, and my plan was to invest it in a certain illegal business I&#039;m running.&nbsp; But, now I&#039;m thinking I should just buy the 10 or so BTC that will buy by then and just let them set for a month.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably make more cash back.<br />

				Yeah, I&#039;ve been waiting a couple months for a small correction so I could buy in as in investment. I keep thinking back to when I had a small handful bitcoins at $10 USD each. If I had held onto those...<br /><br />I was busy and not able to take advantage of that &quot;flash crash&quot; and now the coins are continuing their steady climb. I hope I can buy in at a reasonable price at some point in the near future, but I may have missed the boat for investment potential.
