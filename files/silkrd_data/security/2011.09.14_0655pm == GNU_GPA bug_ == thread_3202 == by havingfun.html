				Hi!<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this forum and SR and i&#039;ve read almost everything at this forum and online about encrypt/decrypt messages. I wouldnt dare to post this, before reading trying and reading things first, lol.<br />I can encrypt my own messages, but I can not decrypt any messages I see at SR. Everytime I try to decrypt I get an error: &#039;General Error, this is probably a bug in GPA, GPA will now try to recover from this error&#039;. But it doesn&#039;t recover nor decrypt.<br />What is it that I do wrong? Or do other ppl also get this &#039;bug&#039; error? <br />Can somebody please help me&nbsp; :D? Because I (ofcourse) want only communicate safely at SR&nbsp; ;) <br />Thank you!<br /><br />

Are you even thinking?<br />Sure, you&#039;re new to GPG but that&#039;s not an excuse to not using your brain.<br />What would be the purpose of encryption if you, some guy who just created a GPG key, would be able to decrypt already encrypted messages?<br /><br /><br />You encrypt for someone else by using their Public Key.<br />They encrypt for you by using your Public Key.<br /><br />You decrypt their message by using your Private Key.<br />They decrypt your message by usiing their Private Key.<br /><br /><br />Sorry, but I think this whole SR thing is way above your head, and for your safety you should stay away from it :)

				I had some difficulties with the GPG but I think its not fault of my brain, but of my English.<br /><br />If you are not a fluent speaker, understand some simple things can become very complex. Some seller just teach me step by step. After that, I understand the full pictorial and the operation of GPG.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sure, you&#039;re new to GPG but that&#039;s not an excuse to not using your brain.<br />What would be the purpose of encryption if you, some guy who just created a GPG key, would be able to decrypt already encrypted messages?<br /><br /><br />You encrypt for someone else by using their Public Key.<br />They encrypt for you by using your Public Key.<br /><br />You decrypt their message by using your Private Key.<br />They decrypt your message by usiing their Private Key.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If I had read this post when I start to use GPG, it would help more than that super-pictorial full details.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to explain, but I hope you understand...

				Thank you both for your respons!<br />And yes you&#039;re right wannabud, its the language. I&#039;m not a fluent English speaker either and that makes it so much harder to understand all options at once. <br />And ravenhawk, you&#039;re right too...if I really thought it would work that way..it wouldnt be safe for anyone for me being on SR. But I do understand that you need both your PK as the PK from the other person, im not THAT stupid :P<br />But I do have another dumb question tho ...some ads have an encrypted message, but I can not decrypt it with my public key nor do I see the public key of the seller. Is it okay to ask for it in an pm? I know I know...its stupid..i&#039;m just learning and trying to do so in English. I hope you understand my question and that you can help me out here ;)<br /><br />thnx!

				That is not a encrypted message. That is their public key so you (or anyone) can import it and encrypt message meant to them.<br />When you want to encrypt a message for someone, first you import his public key (on their profile, read below how it starts) and encrypt it with selecting that particular key.<br />You cant decrypt it, only he can.<br /><br />You can see that&nbsp; (public key)-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Or for message (encrypted message) --------BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

				Somethings you just need to do in practice.<br /><br />You can read a full guide of how to milk a cow, go to a corral and come back with a empty bucket. A farmer guy who never read the guide can do it very easy.<br /><br />If you are not a fluent speaker of the language the guide is written, things become worst.<br /><br />Just try to use PGP and test it on the specific threads and you will understand. You don&#039;t need to be a sacrosanct geek to get it.

				ahh, now I understand!<br />Thank you! And yes, some things you just need to try and learn all in practise. Thats how I learned a lot of computer stuff. <br />And @Nerf, I dont have linux yet, but was planning to install it somewhere this week.
