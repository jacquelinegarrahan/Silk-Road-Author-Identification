				We can safely assume that profiling is occurring here. And with all the threads, namely.. &quot;what is your highest level of education?&quot;.. &quot;have you ever been busted?&quot;.. &quot;where are you from?&quot; .. &quot;how old are you?&quot;.. &quot;how much do you earn?&quot; etc etc you know the things of this kind, it is easy to accidentally present very revealing information about yourself over a period of time and possibly leave yourself open to identification.<br /><br />If you revealed over the course of a few months, that you<br /><br />i) Are 23<br />ii) Live in London<br />iii)) Have a degree in biomedicine and used to work in a soup factory<br />iv) Have savings of roughly Â£20,000<br />v) Currently work in retail<br />vi) Was once arrested for possession of magic mushrooms<br />vii) Took a year off work because of a serious infection<br />viii) Have a pregnant wife.<br /><br />Then it wouldn&#039;t be too hard for law enforcement to identify you based on records that are not available to the public.<br /><br />That might sound like a lot information to say about yourself, but that is when it is seen in a final, compiled list. Over the course of a few months, you would be surprised as to the subtle hints you leave about yourself, and might give away without really realising it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think most of us have anything to worry about, would LE really dedicate such resources to identifying buyers of personal amounts of drugs? Probably not. But erring on the side of paranoia is a good thing here. And there are other nefarious people who might use your identity to blackmail you perhaps.<br /><br />But vendors on the other hand, need to be very careful with this sort of stuff. Even busting one major sr vendor based on evidence of this kind, would bring the integrtiy of the whole operation into question, even artificially. And the growth of SR/bitcoin and the faith in its workings is something we need to maintain if we want to guarantee better anonymity. <br /><br />So I think we should all be careful in what we reveal about ourselves, and it is probably a good idea to leave some subtle red herrings alluding to untrue things about yourself over the course of the time you post here, especially if you&#039;re a vendor who posts a lot.

				An excellent point Kappacino, we can never be too careful.<br /><br />Having said this I think there are times when it can be helpful to reveal certain details. My background in banking for instance tends to reassure some users I have a grasp of the fundamentals of the law of supply and demand when it comes to Bitcoins. There are 1.2 Million finance workers in my area of the UK alone so I feel fairly safe.<br /><br />As you say it&#039;s also when you reveal things like you graduated from Trinity College in Dublin, are left handed and injured yourself in an Archery contest three years ago that the noose begins to tighten around your neck... :-D<br /><br />V.

				..least i&#039;m not the only one to have noticed, some of it is quite easy to spot and come across as surveys and these &quot;surveys&quot; have been on the on<br />&nbsp; the increase since the BBC 5Live +various reports just after.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				A much simpler way for Law Enforcement to catch vendors rather than expensive, time consuming and inaccurate profiling is to simply perform finger print analysis and failing that DNA analysis on packages then compare the results to the criminal database.<br /><br />For example they can order something, then perform analysis and then have forensic evidence. They can either then go and collect said suspect, put said suspect under surveillance or if they can&#039;t find them just sit on it until they get arrested again.<br /><br />You may think this is unlikely but here in the UK the police are doing it all the time. A few weeks back a friend of mine was arrested at a festival for possession of cocaine, only a small amount, and was cautioned. But whilst booking them into the police station and taking finger prints they were like &quot;oh Mr XYZ we need to talk to you as your finger prints and DNA were matched to a burned out car we found 4 years ago&quot;. This person has no previous criminal record or dealings with the police and just happened to be traveling in that car a few days before it was burned out.<br /><br />Needless to say you can never be too careful.

				Honestly, as much as I cringe when I see people reveal personally identifiable information, there&#039;s much more risk that you&#039;ll be writeprinted!<br /><br />Why?&nbsp; First of all stylometric analysis is fully automated, whereas building a profile on someone with PID would be largely done by hand.&nbsp; Stylometry/writeprint is also extremely accurate, like scary accurate, as in experts can accurately attribute authorship to an anonymous text when choosing from a pool of like 100,000 authors (given that the &#039;anonymous&#039; author is known to be someone in that 100,000).&nbsp; Also I&#039;d imagine a writeprint is less likely to be purposefully altered (by this I mean more people here will spread disinformation about themselves than will use adversarial stylometry software like JStylo or Anonymouth).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26174.msg283875#msg283875">Quote from: goturprints on June 11, 2012, 01:57 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">JUST MAKE THROWAWAY ACCOUNTS HOMIE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Writeprint makes it totally easy to correlate accounts given a sufficient amount of text, so if your going to take this strategy I&#039;d recommend making less than 10 posts/100 words per account.&nbsp; Once I crawl these forums I&#039;m planning on doing just this, and find out the answers to such eternal questions such as &#039;does moonbear still post here under a different nym?&#039; and &#039;are misterdank, eeee, etc. the same person?&#039;.&nbsp; It could also be used to identify shill accounts.
