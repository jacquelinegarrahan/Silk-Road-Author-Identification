				So this didnt happen today, or yesterday for that matter (dont want to be specific to protect anonymity).<br />But this is the second time this has happened, first time around was a much smaller amount but now this is pretty fucked. Having legal problems at the moment and really could do with the funds and damn bitpay screw me then dont respond to messages.<br />I sent the coin from blockchain as soon as I got the bitpay address and even though the TX has several confirmations the invoice expired and the coin is gone.<br />Anyone else had this issue?<br />

				I haven&#039;t had this problem, yet, thankfully..just thought i&#039;d share an opinion and experience with you..<br /><br />I needed to buy some coins last night, I couldn&#039;t find anyone selling coins on localbitcoins for moneypaks, so I decided I would give bitinstant a shot. I was charged about $30 all together in fees (which for $500 I guess it isn&#039;t bad, i&#039;m just used to bitfloor :( ). I was really hesitant because I read about all the people here who had lost their money using bitinstant, and it took them weeks to get the money back, if at all.<br /><br />So I set it all up online, printed out the invoice and drove to my nearest moneygram agent..picked up the red phone, put in all the info, then paid the cashier, got my receipt, and left. By the time I had gotten home, the bitcoins were already sitting in the wallet I chose to have bitinstant send them to! I was very very surprised by how fast the service was, considering the moneygram agent I used is only about a 5 minute drive.&#039; <br /><br />Perhaps you should look into using bitinstant, or maybe even localbitcoins if you can find anyone local with coins you can meet up in an internet cafe or something, they send the coins to you while sitting right next to you and you can pay them in cash. Pretty anonymous, but their fees will vary obviously.

				That&#039;s quite a bit of chedda my friend, must be some serious shit... I&#039;m trying to understand what is going on but correct me if I&#039;m wrong. So you sent the coins from your&nbsp; wallet to Bitpay and on blockchain ti showed confirmations then disappeared Is that possible? There&#039;s always a trail that&#039;s left. For the first time, you didn&#039;t get your coins back or happen with that one? <br /><br />That&#039;s pretty fucked, 200BTC isn&#039;t pocket change either. I&#039;m checking their site but there isn&#039;t to much useful info. You check over at the BTC boards?

				Yeah,<br />Im really pissed at this.<br />The 15 minute is far too short but not only that, after the 15 minutes expire when the coin hits the temporary address after the 15 minutes expire then the coin should automatically be returned to the sending address.<br />As I said, twice this has happened and before and I never bothered complaining but with this amount I would expect some prompt answers, 200BTC right now is what, 15,000GBP roughly?<br />That sucks to lose regardless of how much those coin actually cost to aquire, its the potential gain thats killing me and as I said, I only wanted to cash out because I have some very expensive legal bills coming up.<br />I will update here to see what bitpay do; but as a warning to everyone- be careful if transferring large amounts and record EVERY detail about the TX.<br />&nbsp;:(
