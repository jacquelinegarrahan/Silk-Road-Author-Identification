				Do I need to give my SSN if I buy with moneypak from like BTCBuddy or BTC king?&nbsp; Should I buy it from like Mt.Gox?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know all the ways to buy, and I&#039;m rather new to SR

				If you give me your SSN I will give you that many BTC for free :)<br /><br /><br />Fucking kids these days.&nbsp; LMAO.<br /><br /><br />Hey Freddie, <br /><br />This is a drug website, the main point is remaining anonymous and scoring your drugs ;)<br />The point is not to let the people you&#039;re buying shit from to know your personal information.

				The best way for you to do this is go to a store that sells moneypak cards put the amount of money you want on it and buy from BTCBuddy. On his page it explains how to get the bitcoins its super simple. And no you don&#039;t need to give your SSN that&#039;d be fuckin crazy ha.

				Try bitinstant. Cash deposit from walmart, 7-11, etc.&nbsp; Easy and anonymous, it explains how to do it on the site. Please don&#039;t unnecessarily give out your SSN&nbsp; ;)

				Jesus no, don&#039;t give your social security to anybody. <br /><br />Open an account here<br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br /><br />Then go to bitinstant.com, use the bitcoin to email option, using the email you created at tormail. Pick your nearest Bank of America or Chase, Print out the slip and bring it there. If they ask you are doing your parents a favor and have no idea what it&#039;s for. Give it to the teller, and you should have coin soon after. Don&#039;t give personal information to anybody, not even your name.

				I wasn&#039;t planning on giving my SSN away.............................................. Moneypak now requires your ssn to verify your age, and I was asking if I need to verify my age with MP or if I just send the code to the seller.&nbsp;

				Tying your SSN to anything silkroad related is a terrible idea. Moneypak is a shit way of getting bitcoins anyway. There is some kind of limit regarding the amount of moneypaks you can redeem every month, meaning vendors have to charge ridiculous fees for them. Plus once you hand over your moneypak code the person you send it to can screw you and not send you any coins and there isn&#039;t a thing you can do about it. <br /><br />Bitinstant is the best way of obtaining coin that I know of. And now that they&#039;ve added the bitcoin to email option you can do the entire thing within Tor, 100% anonymous.

				Don&#039;t sweat it. My first day on silkroad I tried moneypak too (got scammed), they hadn&#039;t instituted that policy at that point so I didn&#039;t know what you were talking about. <br /><br />When you get your coins into silkroad, please for your own good take an hour to learn PGP encryption before you order anything, it is really very simple and if you send me a PM when you reach that point I&#039;ll even walk you through it. You do not want your address floating around unencrypted.

Instead go to Sugar Mama. But it&#039;s best if you just get your coins yourself. You might try get-bitcoin.com and deposit cash at their bank account, it&#039;s anonymous and reasonable, although a bit slow. <br /><br />Then whatever you do don&#039;t send the coins directly to your SR account, use a laundry service like bitcoin fog. And finally, do install and get up to speed on PGP before ordering anything.<br /><br />Neutron Man

				Don&#039;t do drugs! Do you homework and eat your veggies.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyhoo, posters above me have covered how to anonymously fund your bc wallet. Always, ALWAYS, invest the time and effort in practicing safe &amp; secure interwebbing. <br /><br />On the off chance that you don&#039;t already know: http://www.erowid.org/ for due diligence before partaking.
