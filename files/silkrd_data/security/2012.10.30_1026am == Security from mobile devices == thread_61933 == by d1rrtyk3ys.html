				Is it &quot;safe enough&quot; to trade on SR from my phone?<br /><br />Obviously, I&#039;m running Orbit and browsing with Orweb v2. I&#039;m still to learn about PGP and encryption - a novice hacker, to be sure.<br /><br />Just started to read the How-to post and it goes on about a LiveUSB boot drive thing... is this a necessary step to ensure a safe transaction?

				Unfortunately I&#039;m not familiar with orbot and orweb.<br /><br />PGP encryption is definitely what I&#039;d recommend - if the site is ever compromised, and your messages are NOT encrypted, things may not go so well for you depending on your circumstances.<br /><br />LiveUSB boot drive is not necessary to ensure a safe transaction, it&#039;s basically for people who are paranoid, dealing, or ordering bulk. If you expect your house to be raided and the police to come looking for proof of your use of this site, you should use LiveUSB. Naturally, it&#039;s safest to assume they will do that anyway (you can never be TOO careful), but especially for a small order, or when you&#039;re starting out, it&#039;s not a requirement.

				You said phone. They dont run live linux cd&#039;s or usb&#039;s. Perhaps sd cards?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a 100% sure, but I think android was ok, but iphone has flaws with Tor so it&#039;s not secure.<br /><br />Be 100% sure of what you&#039;re doing with anony browsing with phones. Especially since they have GPS.<br />Avoid using it until you&#039;re 100% sure of what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />That&#039;s my advice&nbsp; 8)

				Good call on the GPS factor. Had not thought of that.<br /><br />No iPhone here, but will just have to trust that when I turn GPS &quot;off&quot;, it really is off.<br /><br />If things go sour there is always the argument that my phone was stolen. Plausible deniablity<br /><br />:-P

				TOR on your phone just seems like a bad idea. Just use your PC with TOR browser bundle or Live USB.

All you can normally do is set it to &quot;911 only&quot; or &quot;friends (insert your brand&#039;s label for this). Some phones rely on gps to keep their system clocks in sync across the phone network as well.

				The question is whether you&#039;re willing to trade convenience for safety. If it&#039;s worth it for you to risk incarceration, a criminal record, a sullied reputation, and thousands of dollars in fines/legal fees for the privilege of surfing SR on your Galaxy Nexus III, then go for it. You probably should not, though.<br /><br />Be careful getting too complacent about just how safe you are on SR. There&#039;s not a news article every time the police arrest someone. A few inconveniences here and there seem like a fair price to pay for my liberty.

Just because my phone accesses the GPS network, what would possibly give my telco provider reason to come chasing me?
