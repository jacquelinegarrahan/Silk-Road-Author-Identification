				So with the recent series of events with tor and tormail i am feeling its time to upgrade my security as far as SR.&nbsp; I am not the greatest when it comes to this kind of stuff. I want to be sure i am doing it right.<br /><br />I have downloaded tails and am planning on putting it on a USB stick. In order to get it to run, where do i go from here? <br /><br />thanks

				Tails is hard to get working on most of the newer Intel Macs.&nbsp; &nbsp;They use something called UEFI, and Tails doesn&#039;t properly support it yet.<br /><br />Oddly, it&#039;ll probably boot fine from a CD/DVD.&nbsp; &nbsp;So if you have a CD/DVDdrive, and don&#039;t mind sitting through frickin five minutes of crunchy CDROM sounds, it&#039;ll boot just fine. <br /><br />You can also find some folks on the Internet that have had luck getting it working with USB, but they had to make some changes to the USB filesystem, if I remember right.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried it, tried refid (which tried to boot it, but failed), and gave up and ended up just running Tails in a VM when I wanted to get online from a Mac.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah im having alot of trouble once i get through one roadblock there is another. I dont have a cd/dvd drive built in so even that is usb operated.&nbsp; Unless someone else can recommend a alternative im thinking the VM is what im going to have to do.<br /><br />How would i go about doing it from a VM without a built in CD/DVD drive?
