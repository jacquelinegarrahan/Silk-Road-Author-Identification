				Ok guys, so I&#039;m relatively new to this dealing game; I&#039;ve been in it for about 6 months. I was getting supplied locally but every supplier I&#039;ve gone through has ass-rape prices so I&#039;ve turned to SR for supply. I realize this is major security risk for myself, but until I can find a more reliable local bulk supplier, the darkweb is my friend.<br /><br />Im having my packages delivered to a P.O Box (My real name). I pick the packages up and when I get to my car I write &quot;Return to sender&quot; on the package before I pull out of the parking lot. In the future as soon as I get supply built up and no longer need shipments the day they come in I plan to leave the shipments in the P.O. Box for the upwards of a week (I&#039;ve been told that LEA wont wait that long to nab somebody). On top of that I&#039;ll also wait before opening packages at my storage area. Any areas to improve here?<br /><br />I currently buy and bulk and then distribute to my sub-dealers. All of them for our inner circle are required to use the app &quot;iCall&quot; which is a ZRTP End-to-End voice encryption VOIP app. I theorize it should be impossible for at LEA to listen to our voicecalls (we do NO texting, if we do we run everything through 256 bit AES encryption apps) but correct me if I&#039;m wrong. If they can, how can they? I know for a fact ZRTP is uncrackable to the current human-generation, so what breaches in security exist there?<br /><br />As far as drops go I drop to my dealers in person, they are all close friends, we all do various substances on the regular and I know for a fact they are not a security risk. Maybe im being naive, but seeing as these guys and I have participated in activities which NO LEA would EVER forgive for squealing I dont see anything wrong there. <br /><br />All my dealers use burner phones for there contacts. They replace the phones either every 2 weeks or when the minutes are up. They typically do face-to-face transactions as clientele initially was VERY against dead-drops in my area. This apart from the shipping I think is the only other weak spot; HOWEVER, we do have a policy that for you to buy from us you have to have a referral friend come with you. Do you think that eliminates a majority of the risk for my dealers? Any ways you would improve?<br /><br />Thank you for your time

				I&#039;m willing to bet you&#039;re the only local dealer who can use a semicolon properly. ;)<br /><br />Sounds like you run a pretty tight ship. The only thing that seems like it might be a problem- and this is by no means gospel (just look at my post count)- is that I&#039;ve heard packages sent to PO boxes get a &quot;closer look&quot; than packages sent to residences. If your name is connected to the PO box/package anyway, you might be better off just having the packages sent to your home to lessen the chance of their being inspected in the first place.

				I don&#039;t think this sounds like s tight ship at all.<br /><br />Having sub-dealers is the big issue here. One of them gets busted, they will roll and squeal like a greedy little piggy up for the slaughter. Also if the cops watch one of them, at some point they&#039;re going to see you come by dropping off packages. By then your encryption will not be worth crap, since one of your nodes is compromised. Also, even though the content is encrypted I&#039;m pretty sure they can still see who is talking to who and when.<br /><br />It&#039;s always the human element where the failure happens. (watch &quot;The Wire&quot; tv show some time)<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re absolutely STUPID to receive bulk packages to an address in your own name. I know SR wisdom says to always use your own name, but that&#039;s for personal use amounts... not getting ounces of smack. Seriously if you can not figure out how to anonymously receive your shipments it is just a matter of time. The cops don&#039;t even need to be on to you, you just have to get unlucky... the mail sorter dropping the envelope in the wrong po box, someone opening and reporting it. Or your package gets accidently torn / opened / dropped / whatever.<br /><br />

				Thanks, ive benefited a lot from reading all this, I don&#039;t 100% trust my middle man to pass it on to the dealer. Only doing small amounts atm. But his lack of knowledge and experience worries me, I have extensive experience with substances but he won&#039;t listen and keeps asking for this and that. changing his mind on product. <br /><br />I know my drugs. Ive purchased on SR and built a good network with vendors, custom orders and such. But still he wants to vendors with bad rating and crap.

				id get lots of fake id together from silk road sources and try set up some large sized PO boxes (in a different town) under that fake name and then rent out the po box for as long as you can - 3 years or so.<br /><br />then go and subscribe to as many mailing lists for christian ministries, financial consulting, computer deals etc. so stuff is flowing in there at least a few times a week.. send yourself letters typed or handwritten (if careful) addressed once in a while<br /><br />if you can get some kind of funding system using a paypal account that you can obtain using those fake credentials you can also start getting ebay items from china or whereever.. get a parcel sent once a month or twice whatever you wish.<br /><br />get it going getting used about 6-12 months for your fake shit and then you might be able to start dropping in the &#039;naughty&#039; parcels once a month.<br /><br />also make sure you go to a town nobody will spot you.. get yourself some clothes you can throw away after each visit and get yourself a very good quality male wig and start visiting it at night or goign whenver you wish<br /><br /><br />dont talk to your local IRL suppliers about this and just gradually say goodbye to them and cut off all ties and make sure your associated dont know about this.<br /><br /><br />you can also set up a storage box at a storage warehouse and store your large stocks in there with secondhand items like wishing machines and TV&#039;s and you can make safe compartments inside those objects and store your stuff in there.<br /><br />other people can pick out my faults or add in other suggestions to what i say. and the most important thing is loose lips sink ships and if you are the head guy you should be keeping allot of your safe storage locations and your obtaining methods from the knowledge of even your best friends<br /><br /><br />id do the stuff above but i wouldnt have friends involved. i&#039;d buy drugs that dont expire like MDMA or chemically stable RC&#039;s or any drug capabale of long term storage... for example id have 20 kilo&#039;s of mdma before i become a vendor and then id never buy any more of it to that PO box (but still having the regular church/computer stuff coming in) until i ran out of that drug. when it was all sitting there id then spend allot of time preparing to sort the drugs into the sizes you&#039;d want to sell and bagging the majority of them up in a clean room so all you have is envelopes all ready to go ordered in the right dosage and you know you have cleaned them all properly and you aren&#039;t having to vacuum seal orders when you are tired and been awake all night filling orders and spending your whole packing time wondering when your next batch is coming in..<br /><br />less stress thinking about all the different issues at the same time ..you will have less work to do when stuff really starts taking off when you make big sales.. you just concentrate on the sales... not the &quot;when will i run out&quot; and &quot;when will i have time to package all that shit up&quot;<br /><br />all in all though - the humans that work with you are the weakest link

				Just gonna echo what everyone has already regarding the human element. The less people know about your actions, the better. If you are the middle man for your friends, don&#039;t tell them shit unless they absolutely, 100% MUST know it to do business. You probably told them about SR already, which sucks, though you can still employ damage control and not talk about it in the future, as well as never telling new people about it, ever. Don&#039;t even mention the internet or anything.<br /><br />The fact that your wholesale customers are close to you can be a blessing and a curse. They may know a lot about you, but you should also be used to how they act on a daily basis. It will be quite easy for you to subconsciously notice a good friend acting suspicious, and thus begin to distance yourself from them.

				Sorry for the wait times, was getting a new burner laptop setup as per a suggestion in another thread. <br /><br />As far as dealing goes, dead drops and so would be fine if I was either just supplying large amounts to a few people or just a small time dealer. This isn&#039;t the case. We push ALOT of product, we deal with ALOT of customers. 90% of these people wouldn&#039;t be able to figure out how to setup their own PGP key let alone encode a message. We&#039;ve had customers get caught before but as stupid as they tech-wise we&#039;ve been fortunate enough to have customers street-smart enough to say they just bumped the product off a random at a party. Doing everything anonymous isn&#039;t an option for us, the volume that we operate at prohibits that. In the future if all goes well and we get our labs up and running, yes, we will definitely change our operations to include complete anonymity, but for now I believe that&#039;s just one of the inherent risks of my trade that I have to take :P For my safety nothing is ever stored to a place linked with me so there would never be any hard-proof to get me in court, but I dont see how we can retain our current size while still promoting everything that was mentioned, if you guys have dealt with large numbers (hundreds) of customers on a basis like this let me know how, if it&#039;s possible I would.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53130.msg524173#msg524173">Quote from: sourman on October 15, 2012, 07:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just gonna echo what everyone has already regarding the human element.

				The postal &#039;noise&#039; thing is a great point.&nbsp; Noise = random junk mail you sign up for, signal = the goods.&nbsp; Keep that philosophy in mind with all things related to your operation, more noise, less signal - its one of the best defenses you have.

				I&#039;ve been good about keeping the &quot;noise&quot; pretty plentiful. I switched over my bank statements, bills, I even signed up for a bunch of mailers and the local paper to be delivered to it.
