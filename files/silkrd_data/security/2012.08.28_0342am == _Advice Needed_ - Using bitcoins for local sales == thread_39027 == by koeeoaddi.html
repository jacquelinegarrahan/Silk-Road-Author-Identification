				ai ai ai.&nbsp; i am interested in the best way one could theoretically integrate the use of bitcoins to facilitate transactions in local dealings.&nbsp; assume that for one reason or another in this theoretical situation,&nbsp; i don&#039;t want there to be any hand to hand exchanges of cash or goods nor do i want a money trail involved in what i am selling to a friend of mine.&nbsp; the goods in question will be sent through the mail after i receive the money.&nbsp; this friend is not very tech-savvy and also doesn&#039;t want to go through a lot of trouble to make the transaction happen, so i am trying to keep it as simple as possible while being able to maintain complete anonymity as far as the transaction goes.&nbsp; <br /><br />the best idea i have come up with is to open up a new mt gox account using a random, public internet connection (coffee shop) within my encrypted USB OS.&nbsp; i then use arumXchange and create a {cash deposit --&gt; mt gox} transaction for the amount i want my friend to pay me, which will then direct me to Trustcash with instructions on depositing the cash.&nbsp; next, i give this friend the Bank of America/Wells Fargo info for the Trustcash account and have her/him go and deposit the money into the account.&nbsp; from here i use the deposited money to buy BTC on mt gox and tumble it around a bit, finally withdrawing the money in well-spaced increments into my bank account.&nbsp; i figure asking these friends of mine to go and simply deposit money into a bank account is a lot easier than having them deal with sending me bitcoins when they aren&#039;t familiar with it in the least.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />does this seem like a safe plan, and are there any easier ways of doing this, with or without BTC? any feedback is appreciated<br /><br />cheers<br />

				I don&#039;t see what the point of all this is, honestly. Do you only know this friend from online? If not, why start a digital information trail? Just have him mail you a check and send him the drugs if it&#039;s long-distance. <br /><br />If it&#039;s short distance, just go the old hand-in-hand method. <br /><br />Good luck and all but this seems rather superfluous.

				thanks for the replies.<br /><br />i am simply very paranoid.&nbsp; i figure in local dealings as long as i do everything else right the biggest risk is in the actual transaction.&nbsp; that is really the only variable i can&#039;t control - a snitch.&nbsp; i can keep a tidy house, keep clean lines of communication, but if somebody is going to try to get me they are going to try to set up a sting.&nbsp; but if i am never able to be associated with the package they receive from me and if i don&#039;t accept any money from the person they can never set up a buy and they can&#039;t use any marked bills/checks received as evidence for a warrant.&nbsp; even if somebody rats me out they still would never have any opportunity to catch me with anything.. i guess that is the point here.&nbsp; <br /><br />snoopish:<br /><br />the paragraph above ought to cover why i wouldn&#039;t want to receive a check/cash/money order/etc. or do a hand to hand transaction.&nbsp; it is superfluous but i am willing to be paranoid to the extreme for the peace of mind it offers.&nbsp; <br /><br />guru:<br /><br />i reckon i am banking on the notion that going through all of these motions will actually serve as a legit safeguard.&nbsp; it would make it much harder for anybody to rat me out (which is most likely way to be busted if everything else is handled professionally) if they aren&#039;t able to gather any evidence from me.&nbsp; all communication is happening through tormail btw - i refuse to even speak face to face; the tormail address is given on a piece of paper, and i explain my M.O. through the tormail.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am willing to risk the Mt. Gox thing.&nbsp; i will go to an unassuming, unhip cafe - they aren&#039;t hard to find in my city.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think many people are privy to mt gox round these parts.&nbsp; and even if the account were to be frozen it would likely be at some point when there is no money in it, because as soon as the deposit is made i will be transferring the BTC to other wallets.<br /><br /><br />the feedback is much appreciated, id love to hear some more input, especially if anybody has a better idea as to how to have them deposit money... the exchangers def take out a small percentage of the money deposited and it adds up, but its worth it if there are no better options.<br /><br />
