				Given this vendor has now given probably 80 people his real name I&#039;d say his privacy is out of the bag.<br />This presents a real problem for anyone who deals with him in the future - even once he gets a new PGP key. <br />He&#039;s currently near the top of the &#039;most likely to get busted&#039; list &amp; if he&#039;s got a bag of packages with addresses on them when he is then a lot of others are going to be dragged into some serious trouble.<br /><br />Are you prepared to name this vendor so we can all keep our distance - at least until he gets a new vendor name?

				I agree, it&#039;s gotta be sarcasm on the part of the vendor.<br /><br />I mean with newb buyers who know absolutely nothing about PGP or information privacy and only want to know the absolute minimum necessary to be able to get drugs shipped to them - sure, I can believe a fair number of them are stupid enough to put their real identity information in the PGP fields.<br /><br />But a vendor? A vendor who&#039;s gone through the trouble to get a vendor account on SR and has been in the drug game long enough to maintain a steady supply of whichever drug(s)? That guy is gonna attach a public PGP key linked to his real identity to a bunch of pictures of the dope he&#039;s got for sale on SR?<br /><br />Sorry, but if this is actually true I think you should reveal which vendor it is since ordering from him would be an incredible security risk for everyone! It will also give the guy a chance to post &#039;hey numbnutz, I was joking - obviously my real name isn&#039;t &quot;Ernest Borgnine&quot; (or whatever).&#039; Seriously, oust this fucker so he can defend himself or so we all can avoid him if not.

				Really if you don&#039;t out this dude then this post has no point. I don&#039;t give a shit about a story of this happening. I want to know who the vendor is. They can come here and state their case and we can all make our own judgement as to what to believe and how to move forward. It seems your intent was to try to help the vendor and potential customers and none of that can happen if the vendor is not called out. This post is about as worthless as the spam if the account isn&#039;t noted in it.
