Assuming Wifi, anyone who is within range of your wifi adapter can see your MAC address and signal strenghth (i.e., locate you). It is also important to remember that when your WiFi card is poered on it spams all access points in the area with an announce packet. Due to this, you need to change your MAC address before you start the WiFi card.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182528.msg1324632#msg1324632">Quote from: connoisseur on July 10, 2013, 08:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2nd question<br />Does anybody have knowledge (NOT opinions) on the FF extension &quot;cryptocat&quot;?<br />Honeypot yes or no?<br /><br />PMs for enquiry about my new public PGP key for deeper explanations are welcome.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Don&#039;t use cryptocat. It is not secure as the random number generator used to generate keys is not very good.

				Sorry I can&#039;t answer any of your questions, but I do have one of my own. When people say &quot;clearnet warning&quot;, what exactly does that mean. I know it&#039;s not a tor website, but does that mean I shouldn&#039;t use tor to access it?

				1. The MAC spoofing program is likely not a honeypot. It&#039;s written by what seems to be a fairly well established developer. I might give it a try myself..<br /><br />2. Don&#039;t use cryptocat, the developers are kids, not professionals. They make a lot of mistakes that make the software unsuitable to guarantee actual private conversation. Instead use GPG to keep conversations private, and transmit the messages via Tor to mask your location.<br /><br />3. When people say &quot;clearnet warning&quot;, it just means they are linking a site that isn&#039;t a Tor onion site, not that you specifically shouldn&#039;t access it via Tor. In my opinion this is fairly silly, as it&#039;s very easy to see the URL you are clicking on.
