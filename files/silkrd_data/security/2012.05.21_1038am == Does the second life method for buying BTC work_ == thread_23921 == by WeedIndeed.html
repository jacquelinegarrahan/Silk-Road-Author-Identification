				There&#039;s a tonne of info on VirWox available, yes it works, is it a hassle, yes.<br /><br />Why are you randomly private messaging people?&nbsp; Only reason I replied to this thread is cuz ya sent me a private msg for no reason, i&#039;ve never spoken to you before, wtf? lol<br /><br />People bitch cuz they gotta install the game but its tiny, takes no work, and your starter guy starts standing right next to one of the terminals you need to connect your account.<br /><br />Profit can be made to if you understand forex because the value of their SLL will dramatically shift sometimes making it worthwhile to buy/sell at twice/three times profit.&nbsp; Only caveat is that if you sold BTC for SLL you&#039;ll have to hold onto the SLL until you can sell em back into BTC at a good market value).<br /><br />There can be several days turnaround waiting for them to clear your SLL and then your BTC, so they are by no means the ideal choice, but a choice non-the less.
