				haha, good question.<br /><br />I remember I used to buy like 50 coins for 200€ or something.<br /><br />If only I would&#039;ve bought more....... :/<br /><br />But yeah, it&#039;s kind of nice to see the currency gain more value. :)

				I remember when I was a skeptical lurker about 6 months ago.. I believe bitcoins were somewhere around 8-10 dollars.<br /><br />I really wish I would have invested in them when they were apparently $2.. I would have loved to be a bitcoin millionaire..lol

				I started using SR right when the BTC market took the big plunge ( middle of last year I believe ? ) and went down to I think around 4 - 5 USD a coin... should have stocked up then. Would have made a pretty penny. Hahaha.

				Last April when I started a buyers acct out on SR it was about $4-5 USD for BTC&#039;s- I remember not using the account for awhile as I was traveling but I&#039;d check things out, but did not have a ship to so it was window shopping only -the BTC&#039;s had almost doubled buy the summer of 2012 when I started back&nbsp;

				It was approx. $3.50 -$4 when I started using SR. I remember buying I gram of Coke and paying 43 BTC for it. (I live in Australia so I&#039;m aware the price is outrageous) where as some Aussie vendor&#039;s selling 1 gram of Coke are now charging approx 16 BTC.

				When I joined, about three weeks ago, ฿1 was equal to £9 ...the highest I&#039;ve seen it though is £16&nbsp; ..so yeah, not gonna be stocking up for a good while yet.<br /><br />I have noticed however, that some vendors are everso slightly adjusting their btc prices, in accordance with the sharp rise..&nbsp;

				13USD , I use USD as the measure because for the moment it is still the defacto global currency.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cant say I have noticed much change in vendor pricing. Although they may be taking some hit in the other direction if they sold and held prior to the crash.

				The first Bitcoins I ever bought (didn&#039;t use them on SR) I paid $1 each for and that was well above market price, but I was feeling generous :) I really wish I would have dumped $8-10K at that point, but I thought they would never get above $5... i was wrong

				HAHA!<br /><br />I thought I was the only one that thought about how much BTC has grown.<br /><br />When I first got on The Road, BTC was mid to late $4 USD range.<br /><br />Not surprised, but never expected it to grow the way it has in the past several months.
