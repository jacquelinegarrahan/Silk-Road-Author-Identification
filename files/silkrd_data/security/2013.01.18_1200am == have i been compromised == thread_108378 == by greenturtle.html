				Hi,<br /><br />So a new vender sent me a message, he said he accidentaly put a certfied mail sticker on the package instead of a dcn sticker. He said there is a $2 differance in postage and I may not get my package. He wants me to resend my address for a reship.<br /><br />1. Where is the package with my name and address going to go back to?<br /><br />2. Should I resend my address, or just say fuck it.<br /><br />Please advise, thanks.<br /><br />Greenturtle

It will either go back to sender,<br />or it will come to you with a bill, saying pay xx to pick up.<br /><br />2. Of course you should. <br />It took me 5 mins to PGP and send.

				They can&#039;t do that. Certified mail is used for legal documents that must be delivered to the recipient. They can&#039;t take the sticker off and stick it in the mail box so the recipient can say, oh, sorry I missed court / didn&#039;t pay my taxes / whatever, I never got that letter.

				He said he did not put enough postage on it for Certified though, so it may not get here. So just say, &quot;I do not know who this is from, can you return it to the sender?&quot;<br /><br />Then where does it go, I do know venders dont put there real address on there.<br /><br />GT

				Either way, he had to pay the shipping and it should be on it&#039;s way. How could he screw that up? They usually ask you &quot;You mean Certified or Registered?&quot;&nbsp; You can&#039;t just put on a DCN sticker throw postage on it, and toss it in a mailbox.

Then he meant to slap a DCN on it but he put certified instead, now the package is going to may not make it to me. I am not worried about that, it was a free sample anyway. I just dont want it to get sent back to a random return address and some stranger gets my address and name, and sees what I was getting shipped to me through the mail.<br /><br />ETA: I sell firearms magazines online and I can slap a Green delivery confirmation on the package. I usually use the due it yourself kiosks at the post office to ship.<br /><br />I put the package on the scale, choose priority shipping, click &quot;dcn&quot; and pay the extra $75 cents and it prints my postage, then I slap on a DCN sticker and drop it in the mail box. If you have a mail scale and a printer at home you can do it yourself too.<br /><br />GT

I&#039;ve been ebaying through there for 10 years. They&#039;ve seen every size and shape parcel come and go to all different countries. <br /><br />Then my kid is into all these video games, and has friends in South Korea, and Japan, so he gets stuff from there. I&#039;ve even been called &quot;Mr International&quot; by one lady who works there...lol<br /><br />All this over shrooms???-&nbsp; LMAO !!!!!!! ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;:-[ Sorry, it&#039;s just that I&#039;ve signed for 2gs of Coke, while checking my oil out front, and a cop leaning against my car chatting with my neighbor. - You want to talk &quot;shitting a brick&quot;???<br /><br />I believe all will be well here. - It was good greeneturtle came on here and discussed it. - I think we all learned something.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				!!!!No worries guys!!!!<br /><br />I just got my pack and he did have the certified mail sticker on it so I did have to sign for it but no big deal to me. All is good, the product looks nice and was vac sealed and stealth was pretty darn good. Should have no problem getting your packs as I said stealth is good. Can&#039;t wait to try them out hopefully this weekend!

				I just have Received My product.<br /><br />So its all good. <br />The mail paid for the mail.<br />It was certified, so I had to sign for it.<br /><br />I had a different mail man today, which I never had before... <br />I was freaked out, and looking back and forth between the box, and slowly signing the box, looking at the mail man face, freaked the fuck out, The mail was nice, but in million years, have I had a different mail man...<br />So no worries though, its all good. Just weird coincidence on my part.<br /><br />So anyways I rip open the box, and its all there. Weight 4.0 grams. So its a bit over.<br />Can wait to rite a review.<br />Need to find his review thread.<br /><br />So it got here, and so I got another package coming for free.<br />Free 1/8th of shrooms + free 1/8th shrooms.<br /><br />

				Damn guys, I wish I would have resent my address, LOL. Oh well, if it gets here it gets here. I have talked to the vendor and he has asked me what I would like to do. I told him we will give it a few days and figure it out then. <br /><br />I am still hopeful, it seems as though it was an honest mistake, thats all. Glad you guys got yours.
