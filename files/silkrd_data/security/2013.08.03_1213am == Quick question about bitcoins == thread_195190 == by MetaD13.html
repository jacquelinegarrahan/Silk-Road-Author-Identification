				i&#039;ve been on SR for awhile and i&#039;ve used BOA bank transfer with BlueSkyTraders everytime to get my bitcoins. Although i haven&#039;t been able to deposit anything in months due to time constraints(BST is closed by the time i get home). So i was wondering is there any quick way to get bitcoins from my house? Like using a debit card to transfer funds for example? I know this might sound dumb, but im just curious.<br /><br />thanks

				Coinbase.com, although you will have to register with your info and bank acct., so its not exactly anonymous. But, yes, you can buy coins without leaving the house

				google btcquick. Used them to buy little bits of coin for last few weeks and its great, if they have the coin once you are signed up and verified (can use debit/cc card) its like 20 minutes from purchase to funding of the private key..there was another thread I think in newbs section where someone else verified they have used them as well with no issues.

				MetaD Don&#039;t listen to anyone but me!<br /><br />Bitcoin-Brokers! I&#039;m telling you... I used to use BST as well, then Local Bitcoins, but when LocalBitcoins didn&#039;t have any offers that appealed to me I tried BitcoinBrokers... THey also allow BofA Deposits and only charge a 2% fee... also very helpful customer service.. check em out

				So many person to person bitcoin sales go wrong, you might get scammed, or maybe they just charge a crazy high fee, try one of the smaller exchanges, BTC-E, Camp-BX, and there are many others, but BTC is cheap on these sites compared to anything on mt gox, or localbitcoins, or someone buying and selling BTC on here!

Its easy once you get registered. You can buy coins from home. And the fees are low, like 1% or 2%, I forget what is is exactly. But if you want to use the coins you bought there on SR, you should run then thru bitcoinfog to anonymize them first.

				why do you use bitfog?<br /><br />the way I see it, if I buy 1 btc from a random off localbitcoins they peel one off the pile and send it to my localbitcoins wallet,&nbsp; I then send it to my sr wallet which I change every time,&nbsp; I only use a sr wallet once. I then spend my btc with one or more vendors and my btc goes to them. They then,&nbsp; at some point sell the coins to a broker and the cycle starts again.<br /><br />how am I compromised,&nbsp; I have exposed myself only to the vendor on localbitcoins, am I missing something.

				Localbitcoins seems like a good option but a lot of the websites used for payment methods aren&#039;t letting US residents sign up for some reason.
