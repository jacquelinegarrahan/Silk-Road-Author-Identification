				Hi,<br /><br />&nbsp;Could any1 enlighten me please.<br />The option to get another bitcoin address in your account setting is for what exactly??<br />If you was to change your BTC address and were still pending deposits of BTC into the account would they still arrive.<br />ie Would they go to the old account number and still be deposited in his account??

				Could you also answer this.<br />Should your btc address for Silk Road change without you doing so??<br />As after looking through MTgox the other day i saw that my early withdrawals went to 1 address and my recent 1 went to another?? But both went to my account.<br />But i did not physically change the address???<br />Now this has also happened with the chap that i started the thread about hence the reason why it came to my attention.<br />Every time i deposit i copy and paste address .<br />Just wonder if it randomise its self every now and again.

				All transactions are kept in the blockchain, it&#039;s how bitcoin works. If the addresses expired, the integrity of the blockchain, and the value of bitcoin itself, would crumble. Each transaction creates a new wallet address, which makes things more difficult to correlate. You would be much easier to track if all of your funds passed through the same address. Transactions are kept secure by this randomization and the tumblers the coins go through.<br /><br />-sSh-

				An excellent post Pine, thank you - you&#039;ve expressed it much more eloquently than I could!<br /><br />In order to have an understanding of how the BTC network operates it helps to have an understanding of Public Key Cryptography - each Bitcoin address is little more than a public key, used to encrypt the coins and of course the corresponding private key is required to unlock them. If it helps think of your public key being a lockable box in which you place the coins and the private key being a physical key with which you can unlock the box and remove the coins.<br /><br />This applies regardless of the type of wallet you use, be it on your computer, a virtual wallet like the one linked to your SR account or even a paper wallet. <br /><br />In the case of an electronic wallet, the block chain is constantly analysed and any coins you have sent/received are updated into your wallet. The system by its very nature must be open in the sense of recording each transaction because as Pine explains you need to continually update your address to make it difficult for transactions to be traced and yet make sure you have an accurate record of whose coins are whose at all times. <br /><br />A central server could regulate this in theory but has a number of potential drawbacks, not the least of which some right wing Judge could come along and send the whole thing crashing down.<br /><br />If your identity can be linked to any BTC address, as I mentioned this would make it possible to trace any past/subsequent transactions to/from that address. Although this is a theoretical vulnerability it underlines the importance of buying and selling BTC for cash, although I probably would say this as this is a service I offer to people in UK/Europe on here!<br /><br />SR has a built in mixer but I am not sure this is suitable for very large amounts of BTC - perhaps Pine can confirm?<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22447.msg232952#msg232952">Quote from: pine on May 10, 2012, 09:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve actually&nbsp; been saying this for for quite some time, if you check through my posts.

You have to be precise because it matters. I mean, there are a couple of activities that I&#039;d regard as a &#039;suspect signature&#039; on the Bitcoin network:<br /><br />- A loop. This is where bitcoins go on a simple or complex journey, but ultimately come back to an address they visited before. This strongly implies that all activities in the loop were orchestrated by the same person. <br /><br />- A convergence. This is where bitcoins spread out among many addresses from a single point, possibly undergoing journeys through other wallets, but all the funds ultimately come back to a single address or a series of addresses that can be shown to be controlled by the same person. <br /><br />i.e. what I am saying, is that if the identity of the person who obtained the coins initially is known, and then all those coins wind up in a series of SR accounts, then you might as well as just bought the bitcoins with your credit card and fired them directly into SR for all the difference it makes. <br /><br />That is: you must either:<br /><br />a: use a mixer. Ideally a blind signature mixer (ask me why). This makes you untraceable.<br />b: obtain bitcoins with cash in the first place. This makes your identity anonymous.<br /><br />Either of those options is very easy to achieve and gives you good anonymity. If you do both, then you are both anonymous and untraceable. Hence the Pine Seal of Approval badge.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22447.msg233141#msg233141">Quote from: vlad1m1r on May 10, 2012, 11:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Severing the link between coins at one address and another before sending won&#039;t work for the simple reason as I explained below that Bitcoins operate on the basis of Public Key Cryptography i.e if I send you an e-mail encrypted with your Public Key you MUST use your own Private Key to decrypt it before sending it to anyone else. <br /><br />Mixers on the other hand do allow you to do this in a limited fashion by swapping your coins with those of others though of course you are trusting the mixing service not to abscond with your coins and that there are sufficient coins to swap around so that you don&#039;t receive any of your own back.

It is possible for a mixer to be compromised i.e. a man in the middle attack, but it not possible for a blind mixer to be compromised. There are also ways of using certain services which make life incredibly difficult for LEO. I have a headache now though -.-
