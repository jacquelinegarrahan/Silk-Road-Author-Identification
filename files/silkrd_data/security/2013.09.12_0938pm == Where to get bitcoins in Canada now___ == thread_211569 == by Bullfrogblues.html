				I sell BTC, although due to certain circumstances I need to verify people myself for Interac e-transer. I accept PayPal for &lt;$100 payable in USD or CAD. I can also sell for money orders (CAD), MoneyGram and Western Union.

There&#039;s not all these bullshit crackdowns like in US.

I know with everything that&#039;s happened recently with MTgox ppl don&#039;t like exchanges and I don&#039;t either but if I needed to I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to use Cavirtex but still localbitcoins.com is super easy and anon as long as you pick a good vendor,

				Are you sure about that? I registered on there without providing verification in the typical sense however if you mean have to provide them your bank information then are correct. Honestly Localbitcoins.com all the way. After using that I won&#039;t use an exhanger unless as a last option.

				Up until just recently virtex allowed cash deposits to your account without verification.&nbsp; Unfortunately now the banks won&#039;t allow third party deposits anymore so they have moved to a bill payment procedure for cash deposits.<br /><br />Honestly, getting verified isn&#039;t that bad, and remember, buying and selling bitcoins is perfectly legal, so setting up an account and getting verified is no more than thousands of other people are doing for perfectly legitimate reasons.<br /><br />The trick is to separate your bitcoin purchases from your SR purchases.&nbsp; Never transfer directly from Virtex to SR.&nbsp; Get your own wallet and run the wallet over TOR.&nbsp; Then bounce the money from your first wallet to a second wallet before sending on to SR.&nbsp; Don&#039;t leave any money in your wallet, keep it empty so you can wipe the wallet from your computer any time you want.&nbsp; If you are running your wallet over TOR there is no way to link an ip address to your transactions and your computer so there is no way to link your bitcoins to SR as long as you wipe your wallet and whatever environment you are using to access SR if needed.<br />

What they do is perform Bitcoin cluster analysis to determine the approximate origins of the coins.

So given already known SR addresses it&#039;s quite trivial to follow the coins and even without that information beforehand it&#039;s still feasible. You&#039;re right in the idea of moving the coins between wallets but your IP is never needed for them to trace the coins. If I follow the coins eventually if you want to cash out then that&#039;s when your identity will be revealed and that&#039;s the dangerous part if you in fact under watch. Bitcoin fog and other laundering services seem like a valid option although I&#039;ve never used any of those services. Still if I had to use an exchange I&#039;d rather use a Canadian one as opposed to an American one.

				For&nbsp; BTC buyers, I will gladly order BTC for you from cavirtex. The lead time is 2-4 business days initially and money can be sent via MoneyGram western Unon, cash by mail or money order by mail (registered/DCN).<br /><br />Small amounts are fine, especially for you to develop trust in me. PM me on SR for a&nbsp; quote.

				Take a look at the SEC slides made up in the pirateat40 trial evidence. They traced every coin he ever had pretty thoroughly. <br />As for Canada there&#039;s a ton of places to get coins, but I don&#039;t want to post any of them here because this is a known drug forum, and cops will point to any suggestions here and use it as an excuse to shut the services down saying &quot;look.. they&#039;re using this service&quot; or the media will do it and pressure the cops to shut them down. <br /><br />Instead you should asking on bitcointalk main forums or #bitcoin-cad on IRC, and not mention drugs, illegal shit, feds, cops...
