If anyone has any information that could help me with this it would be much appreciated. I got monies burring holes in my pockets cus i cantz pgp my address to new venders that if I haven&#039;t already imported their key previously.

The funny thing is, is that I was going to pm you because I figured you would have a good answer.&nbsp; Just thanking you again because with out you and pine&#039;s info on the forums I would have never gotten this far with encryption Yall are the best when it comes to PGP info.

				Also make sure your clock is set to the correct date/time on your computer. If it&#039;s off, GPG will often have difficulty or refuse to import keys, because it thinks they were created in the future.
