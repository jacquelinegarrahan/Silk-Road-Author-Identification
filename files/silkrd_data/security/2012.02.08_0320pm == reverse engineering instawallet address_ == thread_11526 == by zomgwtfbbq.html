				Ok, so let me start off by saying that...<br /><br />a: I know that I am most likely fucked.<br />b: I have nobody to blame for this but myself.<br />c: I don&#039;t want anyone to give me anything for my misfortune other than information - this isn&#039;t a &quot;woe is me, please send me a coin&quot; post.&nbsp; If I can&#039;t recover the coins, then I can&#039;t recover them.<br /><br />But... does anyone know any way to reverse engineer part or all of an instawallet address from a bitcoin address?&nbsp; The instawallet faq pretty much says that if you lose that URL, you&#039;re screwed - the guy that runs it either can&#039;t or won&#039;t help you - and I don&#039;t blame him, but I&#039;m out a non-trivial amount of BTC unless I can figure out a solution here.&nbsp; Basically, I think I clicked away from the wrong tab thinking that I had saved the URL somewhere - I&#039;m not entirely sure - but whatever.&nbsp; I have a dump of half of my laptop&#039;s memory (it crashed during the memory dump process) in the hopes that maybe some or part of the URL is in there somewhere, but so far all I&#039;ve been able to get out of it are all of my instawallet URLs except the one I really need.&nbsp; The more I look at it, the more I think too much time had passed between the time that I realized what had happened and the time that I was able to start dumping RAM, so all my grepping is probably for naught.<br /><br />Feel free to mock my misfortune.&nbsp; But any suggestions for solutions are welcome, too.&nbsp; I briefly considered the idea of trying to brute-force it until I did the math on the number of possible wallet URLs.&nbsp; =/

				If the instawallet admin wasn&#039;t an idiot, he&#039;d be using some sort of (inherently considered secure) hash function to generate the URLs. I think you&#039;re outta luck.<br /><br />And bruteforcing it... yeah, that&#039;s 5.4x10^39 URLs by my count... :-(

				Sorry mate- not to get your hopes up by posting 2 weeks later&nbsp; :-\ but for future reference for all- the same thing happened to me :(<br /><br />I saved the address and not the URL. I realized then before get-bitcoin deposited my money in my account so i VERY promptly emailed them explaining i needed to change my deposit account address. They said they&#039;d proccess my request before it was deposited. This was a good 8 hours before they actually made the deposit. Then never did. Only offered the 5% refund and still haven&#039;t gotten that. For all i know they could have put it in their own account. Otherwise it&#039;s just sitting out there eating up someones server space.<br /><br />At most try and get the fee back somehow mate. I know how you feel- sucks. but as im sure you&#039;ve realized by now life moves on :)

				I wonder how many bitcoins are floating in the limbo because the owner lost the instawallet address or the HDD storing a local wallet crashed... Since mining is going to stop when a fixed total amount of coins is reached, it&#039;s not good at all to have stuff like this happen.
