				Over the last few days I&#039;ve seen a number of keys posted, both here on the forum and on SR vendor pages, of secret keys instead of public keys.<br /><br />This is very bad.&nbsp; The secret or private key should *never* be posted anywhere.&nbsp; As with the passphrase used to unlock it, it should be guarded and protected.&nbsp; If your secret key is available to anyone and you have set a weak passphrase on it then it is possible for the passphrase to be cracked.&nbsp; At that point you, along with anyone encrypting messages to you, are fucked.<br /><br />So when you are exporting your key, double-check that the key looks like this:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: whatever<br />Comment: if you really need one<br /><br />(keyblock)<br /><br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Make sure that it absolutely does NOT look like this:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: whatever<br />Comment: if you really need one<br /><br />(keyblock)<br /><br />-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />I realise that the topic can be difficult to get your head around when starting with it, but it really is worth taking a little time out to do so.<br /><br />I also highly recommend reading this if you&#039;re new to OpenPGP, though it was written for PGP (the proprietary/original software):<br /><br />ftp://ftp.pgpi.org/pub/pgp/6.5/docs/english/IntroToCrypto.pdf<br /><br />The PGP International (pgpi.org) site is a relic from the Crypto Wars, when PGP&#039;s source code was printed, flown to Europe, OCR scanned, compiled and released to the rest of the world because of America&#039;s munitions export laws (printed source code was classed as speech and protected by the First Amendment).<br />
