				Hello,<br /><br />I was wondering if someone could help me answer something I&#039;ve been pondering.&nbsp; Say one day (god forbid) these servers did get breached or seized.&nbsp; Or a dealer&#039;s PC got breached and your address was recovered from the dealer&#039;s computer.&nbsp; Here in the US, would proving that you ordered something be enough to convict you?&nbsp; In my mind, possession is all that matters, so I would be lead to believe that they would have to physically find you w/ contraband on your person or in your home in order to charge you with anything.&nbsp; Am I correct?

				In the UK it is illegal to:<br /><br />Attempt to buy controlled drugs.<br /><br />Be in possession of controlled drugs.<br /><br />Sell or attempt to sell or give away drugs.<br /><br />It is also illegal to have any legal substance if you believe it is a controlled drug.<br />So if you ever get caught by police with an oxo cube that you were sold as cannabis (or glucose that was sold as coke etc) then do not admit what it is and let them do the testing.<br />If you get caught with a kilo of sugar and you tell the police it is coke, then you get charged with having a kilo of coke :-|<br /><br />Like back when BZP was legal, people were getting caught with a thousand pills that they were sold as ecstasy. Best to remain silent or say that they are just legal highs eh.

However, when the Farmer&#039;s Market was busted, some buyers&#039; names and addresses were recovered and they were sent &quot;stern warnings&quot; from the DOJ (some people in this community got the letters) but as far as I know nobody has been prosecuted outside of the core people behind FM. An address alone isn&#039;t evidence of attempting to purchase something, since you could have sent your address to a vendor and never gone through with the purchase. However, the transaction history on SR might be valid evidence of drug purchases. At least items are deleted after 6 weeks, though I think that should be shorter.

				If Johnny Law nabs a big list of buyers it&#039;s pretty safe to say they won&#039;t have the resources to go after every single one, however if they&#039;re looking for someone to &#039;make an example&#039; of they may go after the largest buyers, like maybe ones who they think are redistributing or such.

				I highly doubt they would be able to prosecute you with anything, you possibly, could&#039;ve ordered something in the past that is most likely long gone by now? From a computer your friend might&#039;ve used quite some time ago? Yeah, I don&#039;t really see a case being made against that, you should be safe.

				first off, if you know a vendor that is storing addresses and names..WTF THAT IS AGAINST SR RULES!<br /><br />Not only does that put the buyers in risk, but other vendors too as names tie with others names, etc.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t think that just a name and address can bust you, plus some people use fake names &amp; addresses for their orders.<br />
