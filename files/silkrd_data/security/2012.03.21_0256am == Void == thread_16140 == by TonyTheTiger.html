				i just started ordering off here and i&#039;ve been using moneypak, but theres a 10-17% fee depending on who you go through, which isn&#039;t bad, but there is a faster way for those who cant wait 12 hours. get yourself a savings account with chase bank, and go through btc buddy or btc king for the quickest transfer. theres a 10% fee and a 6 dollar fee which is probably more expensive than using moneypak, but its definitely quicker, add one of there services to your cart and tell them how much you plan to deposit and your deposit code, and within 10 minutes they&#039;ll message you back with there bank name and deposit/transaction number, at chase bank they do bitcoin deposits all the time so you can tell them what you&#039;re doing, other banks are kinda retarded and you might have to tell them you need to make a deposit into your friends account that plays an online video game you&#039;re trying to get into. its a lot simpler than im making it out to be, its just a deposit and most places dont even make you fill out a deposit slip. at least chase bank doesnt, but they ask you for the account/transaction number, so you give it to them and tell them the amount you want to deposit, after you get that done you message the guy you went through and tell him you made the deposit, and within minutes the money will pop up. <br />youre paying about the same since the money pack costs 5 bucks and the service is usually 14% with MP, the deposit is faster for sure though. but im a money pack man and when you develop a friendship with btc buddy he gives you better deals and if you message him before hand he&#039;ll even give you the 10 cents needed to use his service. hes the shit. fo real real.

				The bitcoins do not leave SR.&nbsp; Your only concern would be the cameras recording you whereever you bought your moneypak at.&nbsp; However its nothing to worry about.&nbsp;

				thats going a little too far, i know everyone says the same thing about the cameras, but if a package smells weird or weighs over 500 grams thats usually the only time the post office will intercept the package and call the proper authorities. and when that happens they don&#039;t usually get a warrant and raid your house, the post office usually calls you and if they cant get a hold of you they&#039;ll send you a letter and they say something like we had a suspicious package with your name and address on it and we&#039;d like you to know the post office looks down on sending suspicious materials through the mail or some bullshit like that. in rare cases, if the package is a big bag of hash or a big slab of cocaine they&#039;ll weigh it and let a drug dog sniff it and if it seems really suspicious they&#039;ll hand it over to the police and they&#039;ll spread the word and you might get followed by a private investigator or detective, until they can get evidence to get a warrant for arrest issued. but its rare for the post office to intercept a package, and the only way they&#039;d check a bank camera is if the detective needed it for evidence, but that evidence wouldnt hold up in court because they&#039;ll never know the transaction was made to a guy who sells drugs on an anonymous market, theres really no evidence of that. so the camera thing is really out of the question. usually if they need to build a case they&#039;ll get a private investigator or detective to follow you around and take pictures of drug deals or snap a pic of you yelling at the mailbox when you&#039;re package doesnt arrive. this sites safer than you think, well not the tor network, but the encryption is safer than shit. you dont have to worry about bank deposits cause theres no evidence that can be obtained from making a deposit...the sellers are taking the risk here. the buyers just have to worry about a call from the post office or a piece of paper attatched to your package from the post office. which is rare unless the seller has shitty packaging techniques. always go with a 100 rated seller, because sellers can go rogue and steal your money at any time, which is rare also, but it does happen.
