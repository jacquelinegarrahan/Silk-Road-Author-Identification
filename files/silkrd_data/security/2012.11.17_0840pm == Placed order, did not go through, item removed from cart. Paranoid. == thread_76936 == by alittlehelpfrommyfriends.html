				I placed an order with a vendor, and typed in my address encrypted with PGP. I clicked submit, and I was redirected to the welcome page. My bitcoin count did not decrease, there was no order in the orders page, and there was nothing in the cart. I figured if something had gone wrong and the order did not go through, it would at least still appear in the cart, but it didn&#039;t. After reading some forum posts, I&#039;m paranoid about LE being behind this, and that my address was intercepted (and the PGP public key was put there by them.) To make matters worse, the item is no longer available (it sold out) and the vendor is not responding to messages (although he did say he has a busy weekend.) Am I being paranoid for no reason?

				IMO in a word YES, a website that just got overhauled had a glitch so now they have issued a warrant to for a product you have not even ordered&nbsp; and they are coming to bust your door down.....WOW sorry but I couldn&#039;t resist. Ther have been some issues about stealth mode I would PM the vendor to see if the did it or a glitch in the website.<br />

				Sounds to me like the vendor ran out of stock while you were making the order. It has happened to me, too.

				on this road, even in trouble free time, best to question everything and use security measures to validate trust. i find this troubling. i advise caution &amp; thought before next step. could be you just step in mud, but next step into lake. new account is advisable perhaps in the least and a housecleaning party for confidence. when you know you have taken all steps to minimize risk possible, sleep comes easier. good luck toward you SR brothers and sisters.

				I would not worry too much, this happened to me four consecutive times before I eventually got the order placed, and this was 2 days ago. It had me totally baffled as well, but knowing there were issues with the site, I just kept trying and on the fourth try it worked OK. I guess you were unlucky that it coincided with the vendor taking his listing down or something similar. Should be OK now though.
