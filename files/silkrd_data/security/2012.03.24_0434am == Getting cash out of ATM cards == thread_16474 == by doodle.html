				i&#039;m looking for a card that takes wires and/or Liberty reserve and allows me to withdraw in cash. I&#039;ve searched online and i really can&#039;t find any program that&#039;s still alive. This card also has to be shippable outside of the states.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />

				There are actually a few different cards you can buy on the clearnet, just google for &quot;anonymous prepaid debit card&quot;. Some are areally<br />completely anonymous, others use the term meaning &quot;anonymous to the merchant&quot; but not to the bank/issuing company. Those usually<br />cost quite a lot of money, depending on the limits and level of anonymity.<br /><br />I am offering the afaik cheapest variant of such anonymous and reloadable prepaid cards:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/123f2d69ed<br /><br />If you want to load the card with IBAN/BIC SEPA transfer and withdraw by ATM (any ATM with a VISA logo should work), this might be<br />for you, The cards are completely anonymous, you CAN register them online (using fake names/addresses is possible), but you DON&#039;T NEED TO!<br />The website is usueful to check balance, change PIN, etc.<br />The downside of the card are the very low limits: max 150 EUR withdrawal per day, max 750 EUR balance on the card, maximum yearly load<br />amount 2500 or 3500 EUR, cannot say for sure right now.<br /><br />If you are interested please read the item description, I have explained as well as I could there.<br />Rebates for bulk orders available.<br /><br />There are other vendors selling more or less the same thing, I think I am the cheapest, but if you find someone cheaper make sure to get<br />a card in EUR and valid until 2014. I have bought one in PLN valid till 2013 only for almost double what I am charging.<br />The problem with PLN cards is that you have to pay conversion fees when withdrawing in EUR and the limits are not fixed in EUR but in PLN,<br />so you might find that you can only withdraw 130 EUR instead of 150.<br /><br />As for offering this here: There is no problem, markwest probably thought that those are stolen cards and/or accounts, which may not be offered here.<br />One warning in this context: If you are planning to do the paypal merchant/checkout fraud, don&#039;t, it won&#039;t work or be too much effort for the gain.<br /><br />
