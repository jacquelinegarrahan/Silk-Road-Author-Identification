				Theoretically, if you knew you were compromised (i.e. had a CD to your door this afternoon) what would you do?<br /><br />First off, no, I&#039;m not in this situation. I&#039;ve just never read anything about what the strategy should be if I ever was in this situation. Better to be prepared ahead of time!<br /><br />First things that obviously come to mind for me is to delete the Tor bundle, any docs on my laptop with log-in info for sites such as Bitinstant, &amp; any thing like trip reports/drug related stuff in general.<br /><br />I&#039;m not the most technically -gifted person around, but I know there are a lot more steps that would need to be taken to give yourself a better chance of avoiding jail. Any tips?

				Clearing ALL traces? Get an NSA-approved degaussing paddle. Yes, they might seize the wand as evidence, but even a team of the DoD&#039;s best forensic analysts wouldn&#039;t be able to retrieve a thing from your computer. ;)<br /><br />Seriously, though, you realize that just deleting a file or program from a computer doesn&#039;t do much. You need to overwrite the part of the disk that the file was using with new information; until that&#039;s done, the file can be recovered without too much effort. Look for software that incorporates the Guttman method of data erasure. <br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re using TOR from home without a VPN (or without bridges), your ISP will have records of that use. Even if you deleted the browser bundle it wouldn&#039;t take more than a quick look at your IP logs to show not only that you&#039;d been using TOR, but how much time you&#039;d spent been using it. <br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to say more without knowing the situation. The question might sound simple, but any answer that would be worth anything depends on the person asking (personal use buyer of weed vs bulk reseller? what country?), the computer setup they&#039;re using, the security precautions already in place, and the circumstances surrounding the CD. <br /><br />And my tip is to minimize any traces to begin with.

				There&#039;s some tools out there to wipe the hard drive, but they erase everything. It has to write it with random data a number of times to ensure the data can&#039;t be recovered. Then just reinstall plain windows or something so it at least looks like it was in normal use but no traces of anything else on there.

				Darins Boot &amp; Nuke. Pop the cd in. Let it rip. Free by the way. But that is only going to eliminate the traces on your hard drive. It can&#039;t/won&#039;t eliminate what can be found through back tracing steps, transactions and fuck ups. Best thing? Boot and Nuke and SHUT THE FUCK UP. ;) Good luck out there.

				If they find the drugs in the mail and do a CD, they still have no way of knowing who purchased it or from where. You still have plausible deniability.<br /><br />The most important thing, besides keeping your mouth shut, is to not have any record of your SR username/password. After all, your entire transaction history is stored there including, presumably, the shipment they intercepted. Keep that login data encrypted with a *STRONG* password either on a hidden partition or a usb stick. Better yet, keep that information only in your head (and keep your mouth shut).<br /><br />If you get CD&#039;d, it&#039;s highly unlikely you&#039;ll have time to DBAN the hard drive - yanking the power cord out of the wall when seizing a computer is SOP for the swine. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

However, I don&#039;t think they can really prove *where* you were going with TOR. With the recent NSA debacle, I think it&#039;s a lot more plausible than it used to be to just claim you use TOR because you feel like the government recording everything you do is immoral.

				Why would you have documents on your computer with login information about any of these sites anyways? Keep all that shit in your brain. If you can&#039;t remember it, create a tormail or some other anonymous email account and keep an email there with the information (Create the account with TOR obviously) then all you have to do is remember that one specific URL.<br /><br />If you ABSOLUTELY need to have login information or any incriminating evidence &quot;written down&quot; somewhere, here&#039;s what I would suggest: Find an old BlackBery phone that is for sale for cheap. Don&#039;t activate any service to it. Set a password on it, change the timeout to 3 for the device wipe. Shit hits the fan, all you have to do is enter the wrong password 3x and it will automatically and instantly wipe everything off of the device and reboot it to a factory setting. <br /><br />As far as the bundles and TOR browser, so long as you don&#039;t have pages bookmarked or any type of history in the browser, so what? They can prove that you have TOR and use it, but can&#039;t prove what you are doing with it. All you are is a paranoid american who learned about TOR in the last few weeks/months when all this NSA/Big Brother shit came to light. <br /><br />But seriously, I would highly encourage you to get any and all documents off of your hard drive. No paper notes laying around the house or hidden or anything either.

				Never talk to LE.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; By far the most important security tactic.<br /><br />TrueCrypt for any/all drives is mandatory.&nbsp; Even if you segregate &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; activity drives - encrypt them all.&nbsp; This makes it look less suspicious and you more nerdy.<br /><br />Encryption is only as good as the password.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be lazy here.<br /><br />The point re: ISP showing records of you *using* TOR (*not* what you did while using it) is a very eye opening one to me.<br /><br />Plausible deniability is the ultimate goal.&nbsp; So think hard about what you &quot;hide&quot; and what you don&#039;t.&nbsp; For example, TOR and BTC are legal.&nbsp; Keep in mind the ISP point above.&nbsp; So why not keep them on your (encrypted) &quot;clean&quot; drive/OS that you use for everything else that is legal?<br /><br />Vendor PGP keys and history, any drug related URLs or notes, illegal records, BTC wallet data files, user names, etc, should be kept on a USB thumb drive, which you have encrypted and can easily be physically compromised/destroyed.&nbsp; Why not?<br /><br />Always be mindful of what information/sites you access via your clearnet after you have started the TOR game.&nbsp; For example I looked up all kinds of info about illegal drugs since I was a kid, using clearnet and my ISP.&nbsp; I am sure we all did.&nbsp; This is a great and well established and healthful activity that is totally legal in USA.&nbsp; <br /><br />But once I used TOR to access SR for the first time, I keep things pretty clean (except nice legal pr0n duh) on clearnet, and use TOR for anything borderline.&nbsp; A good example here is pill identification sites.&nbsp; Use TOR.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Or researching your DOC that you have purchased on SR.&nbsp; Use TOR.&nbsp; Why not?<br /><br />Please tell me what I am missing here!<br /><br />

				If you are only importing personal amounts and they show up to your door they are fishing and trying to either scare you into stopping or get you to admit to something because obviously they don&#039;t have the evidence for a warrant or they&#039;d be inside ripping everything apart.<br /><br />&quot;Am I being charged with anything? No? Goodbye&quot;<br /><br />If you are selling, and you don&#039;t already have full disc encryption then you&#039;ve immediately lost because there won&#039;t be any time to delete anything when they come in at 5am guns drawn. Not like forensic software can&#039;t recover any deleted files anyway, or they can&#039;t check your google search history to find drug forums on clearnet you went to (or to google the SR .onion link), or they can ask your ISP for full records of every single site you went to unless you always used Tor for anything drug related. Can&#039;t exactly delete vac and mylar sealers, or bags of drugs lying around, or scales and shipping receipts or materials either. If you have&nbsp; a label printer it probably can be matched up to whatever they seized easily, or even store the last few labels in memory so they can re-print them. Only way to avoid this is get a cash paid anonymous safe house and hope you aren&#039;t followed to it everyday. <br /><br />

				Ultimately, the best thing to do is use TAILS with an Encrypted USB. Personally I take it a step further and hide truecrypt containers on the encrypted part of the drive so if they did get into it they would need to find the container, which has a hidden section of it, so if I am forced to give up the password, I can give them access to the nonsensitivee part of the container. The sensitive part uses a different password. The container which contains all of my secret keys, my bitcoin wallet keys, etc. On top of that all of the sensitive files inside of that are encrypted to a secret key that I have hidden somewhere. Did I mention my password for my encrypted section of the OS is over 50 characters long.<br /><br />On top of all this I have it backed up on another USB hidden off somewhere. So if it&#039;s ever compromised, there is no way they will get into it. I(or someone else) can go retrieve it, unlock everything, and move/sell my bitcoins to a safer place so even in the 0.0001% chance they get into my drive, they won&#039;t confiscate my bitcoins. All they will find is my secret keys and nothing else. <br /><br />That&#039;s the great thing about bitcoins. They are stored collectively on the network, not on your PC. You can have your key to your wallet in a million places and from any one of those places you can move your bitcoins. If any one of those places is accessed and your private key is used your bitcoins can be moved to another wallet with a different key, and those other &#039;million&#039; places with your other wallet key instantly become completely useless. Bitcoin is a truley amazing thing when you understand how it works.<br /><br />Most importantly, exercise your rights, especially your fifth amendment. Do not break laws that you&#039;re not willing to do time for... if you&#039;re doing it for profit, better make sure the risk is worth the money. Plan for ever scenario. If they ever did a CD on me, I would most assuredely take a 2-3 month break from everything illegal, and keep my eyes open to see if they&#039;re watching. That is even if the CD fails and nothing comes of it. <br /><br />With that said. If a CD happens. I hope you were making enough money to have enough to hold you over for 2-3 months, or better yet, I hope that wasn&#039;t your only source of income. Be prepared.
