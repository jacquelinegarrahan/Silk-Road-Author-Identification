				...how should I know?<br /><br />But what about this idea:<br /><br />Generate brainwallets based on universally accessible passages from literature.<br />For instance, generate a brainwallet from a bible KJV verse (say, 20 words each)<br />Make as many of these as needed, putting different amounts of money in each one, related to the verse number.<br />John 3:16 would have 316B in it. &amp; cetera.<br /><br />Then if he ever gets busted he could bribe his way out one jail official at a time simply by giving them the bible verses.

				The problem with this idea is that there is a highly discernible pattern that you can easily figure out.<br /><br />Once someone accepts a few bribes, he can just start trying bible verses until he gets lucky.<br /><br />A prison official could even modify vanitygen to test them automatically, maybe.

				you mean like.. a jail official would give im a pick so he can shawshank his way out? because that&#039;s all that &quot;jail officials&quot; could do. a federal bureaucracy, like the DEA is different on the other hand.

				Well maybe the bribing his way out of prison part would be tough.<br /><br />I have enough trouble explaining brainwallets to educated intelligent people. Forget the incest-baby microcephalic civil servants who get jobs as COs.<br /><br />But if DPR did get busted it would be high enough profile that they&#039;d hear something about all the internet funny-money prisoner #2015DPR had stashed away.

				Pretty easy to cash out 10+ million dollars?<br /><br />You realize there is only one legit bitcoin business in the world that pulls in money like SR, and that&#039;s Mt.

Cashing out over $1 million in bitcoins a year is pretty difficult without getting noticed. That is why DPR is most likely NOT retired on a private island yet. :)

				I always have pictured DPR kind of like the &quot;Girl with the dragon tattoo&quot;.<br /><br />I think that with his knowledge he can leave a few breadcrumbs that would direct the suspicion away from him(his ethnicity, sex etc.)<br /><br />Imo keeping it in gold and buried away somewhere in the desert would be the best way.<br /><br />All the very best to you all!<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I mean what&#039;s the difference, you can get pretty much cash out all you can spend without getting noticed. And something tells me that DPR isn&#039;t the type to really want to drown himself in his own money, spending it like a glutton.
