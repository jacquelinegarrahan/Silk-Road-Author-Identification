				BitcoinATM Press Demonstration<br /><br />May 2nd, 1:00 pm at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, CA<br /><br /><br />BitcoinATM is announcing its grand inauguration and launch press conference and reception. BitcoinATM will be unveiling its G6000 BitcoinATM at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, CA on Thursday, May 2, 2013 at 1pm. The machine will be displayed and presented as fully functional for both cash in and cash out capabilities with a real time presentation showing the funds flowing into or out of bitcoin wallets.<br /><br />There is a limited number of space available for the afternoon gathering and a large amount of interest, so BitcoinATM asks all media and interested parties to send the company an e-mail to RSVP to Justin@BitcoinATM.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Anyone around there going to try it??

				What would be the security risks of using one of these atms to deposit cash to get btc? I know they have cameras but couldn&#039;t you walk up with sunglasses and a hoody of send someone else up and deposit your cash. I mean buying btc is totally legal. Have them sent to a legit wallet then do a few transfers to get them to SR? Seems way easier and safer then bitinstant or having your bank account linked up like coinbase.

				I am sure that as with all ATMs, it will have a relatively small maximum amount that can be withdrawn daily. And as all ATMs, it can&#039;t really have all that much cash in it, else it becomes a tempting target for criminals and/or hackers. I wonder who will be in charge of taking the cash out/putting the cash in every 24 hours or so. Armoured truck guards? That can be awfully expensive.

				Sure it could have a maximum withdrawal amount.&nbsp; But you have to remember,&nbsp; you are not sticking a debit card in this machine.&nbsp; You are simply punching your bitcoin address in.&nbsp; If there is a max amount,&nbsp; why not spread your bitcoins between a bunch of addresses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also,&nbsp; people talking about CC# Skimmers and cameras.&nbsp; Please read more closely.&nbsp; This ATM is going to be located INSIDE the Hotel Del Coronado.&nbsp; That&#039;s a high class hotel and I assume it would be pretty hard to get away with setting up a skimmer in there.&nbsp;

				Mine as well start walking inside the post with a name tag on and letting the workers know your shipping illegal goods as well, while you&#039;re at it. If you&#039;re a vendor is it really worth the risk? Theres literally one in the world. Yes coins arent illegal and for the most part untraceable but if you honestly need to cash out your coins via an atm then you need to rethink your business infrastructure.

				What&#039;s the big deal?&nbsp; If you take care of your coins and where they&#039;ve been, you should have no qualms about sending a trusted 3rd party to withdraw chunks of cash for you.&nbsp; Now, if they aren&#039;t going to allow withdrawals &gt;$1000, then there&#039;s no point wasting anymore time talking about it.&nbsp; Stick to the tested methods which preserve anonymity but cost you more in terms of fees and time wasted/spent.&nbsp; Just a free 2cents :)

It never materialized to my understanding. I would venture to guess that the government didn&#039;t want a competing financial system in the country while the countries&#039; citizens have lost faith in the current financial system.

Each ATM owner (franchisee) would have to be registered as a MSB in each state they operate in. This is an extremely expensive and tedious process. For reference to get registered in all 50 states would cost ~$25mil/year. So not that it can&#039;t happen, just that it&#039;s currently so unprofitable that noone would buy, let alone implement these. <br /><br />Now there is an interesting project currently being developed in Cyprus. It&#039;s a dual-debit card that hold currency in both EUR and BTC. The card project is Neo, the payment network project is Bee. You can find it on the Bitcointalk forums. This IMO is the best way to implement BTC into an existing FIAT-based economy.
