				I signed in MT.Gox using tor, since i couldn&#039;t login again using tor, i logged in using VPN on my smart phone. I am located in a country where my only option to fund MT.Gox for bit coins is through bank transfer. And after that i am going to transfer the BTC to instawallet, then tumble it through bitcoinfog and then transfer itto SR before doing any transaction. I took 2 full days to understand all these and the PGP things. Still I have a few questions and i would really appreciate your help<br /><br />1. Will my IP address be hidden while using VPN on my smartphone to access MT.Gox<br />2. I gave my actual real name on MT.Gox since i read in the blogs, that they require the fund sender&#039;s name to be same as the one in MT.Gox. Is it true and is it safe to give the real name? <br />3. And is the scanning and inputting of ID copies compulsory in MT.Gox?<br />3.what is the other alternative to MT.Gox where i can do bank transfer or western union?<br />4. And are the above steps perfect or am i wrong somewhere? if yes please give your inputs as i don&#039;t want to make any error.<br /><br />looking for response form sombody

				1. Yes your IP address and network information will be encrypted using the VPN (do not access MT Gox using TOR or they will suspend your account)<br />2. Technically yes, it&#039;s safe to use your real name in case they ever decide to pull some bs on you and require to verify your account (which happens all the time) and buying/selling bitcoin is not illegal and since you said you&#039;re washing the coins that&#039;s even safer.<br />3. I believe it&#039;s now required to verify your account, at least for dwolla it is not sure about bank transfers though. <br />4. Intersango, vendors on here SR, etc. <br /><br /><br />So far you&#039;re doing everything right, I think you&#039;re doing better than 90% of the noobies that are coming in (I just made up that statistic don&#039;t tell pine&nbsp; :D )

If you plan to give any site and REAL information about yourself, then VPN/Tor are not only not needed, but it some cases a hindrance (Mt.Gox + Tor = account suspended.)<br /><br />

I&#039;m just assuming that the OP is not from the US and most likely is blocked (China perhaps?), regardless though adding a VPN definitely wouldn&#039;t do any harm but you&#039;re right though it wouldn&#039;t add anything to the OP&#039;s anonymity.

				As others have said, the VPN may be unnecessary. If that is the only way you can access MT.gox (since they don&#039;t like Tor) then use the VPN, otherwise it isn&#039;t required.<br /><br />I also think the Instawallet step is not necessary. It is fine to go straight from MT.gox, with your real name and all, straight to Bitcoin Fog. The worst case scenario would be that someone could prove you made a deposit to Bitcoin Fog. Assuming you let the funds bounce around in the fog for a sufficient period of time, they still wouldn&#039;t be able to prove where/when/if you extracted those funds.<br /><br />Using Instawallet won&#039;t cause any problems, but it would be so easy to trace back to the MT.gox transaction that it hardly seems worth doing. Just my opinion.<br /><br />From Bitcoin Fog, wait a week or so, then deposit from Bitcoin Fog directly to Silk Road. At that point you&#039;re good to go.
