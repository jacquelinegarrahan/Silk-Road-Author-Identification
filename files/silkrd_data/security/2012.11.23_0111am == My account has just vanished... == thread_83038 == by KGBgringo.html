				I was just on the site about 30 minutes ago, have just gone to go back on it and it auto signed me out when I clicked a link, so I signed back in, again as soon as I clicked a link it signed me out again and now I am unable to sign in at all, it&#039;s as though my password has been changed.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s doing the same thing for me.<br /><br />When SR first came back up a week or so ago I was getting rejected as if my account didn&#039;t exist, and that was with me copy-pasting my password to make sure I had it right. Don&#039;t panic. :)
