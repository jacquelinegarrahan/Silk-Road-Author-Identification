				I have the desktop bitcoin wallet application but i changed the password of the encryption while I was fucked up. Luckily I had 0.01 btc in there but now I&#039;m stuck with no wallet. Can anyone share with me some alternatives to getting your BTC on SR? I&#039;m not quite sure which online wallets are safe to use and what not. Thank you.

Alternatively just go to Bitcoin.org and download another wallet.<br /><br />V.

				Sorry I was a bit unclear. I have access to the wallet but can&#039;t send funds due to me not remembering the password. I tried reinstalling the wallet and it still remained the same. Is there any way to completely start a new wallet or are there any online wallets I could use? I would really prefer not sending the coins directly to SR.

Sad to say you won&#039;t be able to access the funds in your old wallet unless you remember your password from the looks of it!<br /><br />V.

				You asked how to start a new wallet with sathoshi bitcoin client?<br /><br />&nbsp;* delete the file named &quot;wallet.dat&quot; (on linux it&#039;s in ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat)<br /><br />client will generate a new EMPTY wallet when you next start it (you did stop it before deleting wallet.dat, right?<br /><br />I can recommend Armory bitcoin client, awesome feature-set, but needs a running bitcoind, so it&#039;s not really a replacement. <br /><br />For an online-wallet I recommend http://blockchain.info/wallet. Pretty secure, but the general recommendation (the only keep encrypted version of your keys, signin of transactions is done running javascript locally within the browser) still applies: don&#039;t use it for long-term storage.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to store some coins in a safe way (safe against theft, that is), you can use &quot;cold storage&quot;. google &quot;armory offline wallet&quot; to see how it&#039;s easily done with armory.<br /><br />I suggest using the bitcoin forum for such matters, much more info and faster page-loading...<br />

				If you&#039;re running a windows client you can just rename/delete/move whatever the old wallet.dat file.<br />When bitcoin client starts back up it will generate a new wallet for you.<br />The file, on windows 7 systems, is located in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\
