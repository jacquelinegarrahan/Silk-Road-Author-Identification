				I am in the USA and writing return to sender and putting by door almost seems to easy. I would still think the police would still try hard to pin it on you and I think would have a decent shot in court. <br /><br />I have thought about going to the mail in the morning and if what I need is in there just put it back in the mailbox until that evening. That way if they did bust down your door you could legitimately say you left something in the mailbox that could be your package? <br /><br />Does anyone have any LEGIT knowledge on this ? <br /><br />would be great if we had a USPS person in here to discuss

				It would most likely be more convincing to a judge/jury that you wrote &#039;Return to Sender&#039; if it wasn&#039;t sent under your real name.

				In our many years of experience we have never encountered any mail delivery problems or investigations if using a fake name sent to your home address (if sent domestically). Specifically if using Priority Mail. <br /><br />Although delivery problems can arise if using a name not registered to a PO Box (which should preferably be opened with a fake, photoshoped ID, &#039;if&#039; you must), and only &#039;investigations&#039; if attempting to import orders from another country.<br /><br />In our experience. ;)<br /><br />Peace

				I haven&#039;t even heard of problems importing from overseas to fake names as long as a PO or PMB isn&#039;t being used and the importer doesn&#039;t live in a town with 100 people and a mailman who knows every single person on his route <br /><br />disclaimer: I wouldn&#039;t suggest importing from overseas unless you have a fake ID PO or PMB. Domestic it is much less risky I very very very rarely hear of any problems at all with domestic shipments, unless they are for kilos of coke.

So the package is returned to the sorting office and an investigation begins.<br /><br />I would say that 1-2 people per month are reporting this happening on this forum.

If your ordering a small amount/envelope from overseas (like the majority of those may be doing on this forum) your probably good to go, although you may indeed receive a nice love letter from the kids at customs at times. Or a knock or 20 on your door, depending on the amount. I guess when I think importing kmf, I think &#039;IMPORTING&#039;!. ;)<br /><br />@ Duckman: Domestically, mail (Priority in particular) ALWAYS get&#039;s delivered. Do you realize how many pieces of mail pass thru the USPS system every day? Do you realize how many people have mail delivered to a friends/family members house ALL the time? Or the shear number of people that move everyday? It&#039;s NOT an automatic red flag for a return to the Postal Inspectors for an &quot;investigation&quot;. <br /><br />Receiving grandma&#039;s mail while you are helping her move is not &#039;reasonable suspicion&#039;, let alone &#039;probable cause&#039;. It takes a federal warrant to open USPS mail. And that&#039;s assuming your postman is a super computer (with an accompanying super-duper-memory) who chooses to NOT do their job, and instead decides to return hundreds of letters a day to their boss for &#039;investigation&#039;&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now times that by a gazzillion mailmen/women everyday in any given city/state. All that mail under investigation must now be piling up somewhere with the massive recent budget cuts at USPS. I guess grandma&#039;s accross the nation won&#039;t be getting their mail delivered today then, and are now under &#039;investigation&#039;?<br /><br />When someone PAYS $5+ for Priority Mail, it get&#039;s delivered. Period.<br /><br />First-class just get&#039;s delivered &#039;regardless&#039;. <br /><br />It&#039;s the address not the name that determines if a letter gets delivered. Raise your hand if you still get mail from the previous resident at your home address? Or all those poor &quot;current resident&#039;s&quot; as well.<br /><br />They are now ALL under investigation. So watch your back and be really careful if you have EVER moved! If a piece of mail accidentely got delivered to your previous address, guess what? Wrong name. You are also now also under investigation. <br /><br />I guess the entire nation is now under investigation. (But what else is new?)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />It&#039;s most likely other factors that contributed to any of the &#039;investigations&#039; you may be pondering my friend. Not the simple use of a fake (or your friends, or grandma&#039;s name) on the letter. It&#039;s &quot;rain or shine&quot; my friend. Domestic USPS mail makes it thru. <br /><br />Now a 20 pound overly taped box, reeking of weed and leaking LSD addressed to a fake name might be reason for a second look. It&#039;s normally &quot;other&quot; factors that contribute to investigations (or even &#039;considerations&#039;), not the simple fact of using a fake (or misspelled) name alone. Roommates move in and out ALL the time as well. <br /><br />If this were true, MILLIONS of pieces of mail would never even leave the closest processing center without being an accompanied by a Postal Inspector.<br /><br />My ex&#039;s father delivered mail for USPS for 20+ years, btw. ;)<br /><br />Peace<br />
