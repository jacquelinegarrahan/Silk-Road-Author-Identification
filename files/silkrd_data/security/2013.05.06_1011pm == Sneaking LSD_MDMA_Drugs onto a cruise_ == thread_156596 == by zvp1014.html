				Hello all!<br /><br />I was wondering if anybody here had ideals or experience in sneaking drugs onto a cruise ship (Carnival, Norwegian, Royal Carribean etc.)<br /><br />They scan your baggage and send you through a metal detector as you board the ship; though I presume they&#039;re only looking for weaponry (and I&#039;m not sure if any law enforcement office is in charge of this process, or rather a private security firm the cruise hires).<br /><br />Would be safe to just put the LSD in a baggie, shove it in a pocket cluttered by other papers and whatnot, and run it through the scanner? Do you think they&#039;d be suspicious and open the bag to check- or just dismiss it as paper in a bag?<br /><br />As for MDMA, I&#039;d be bringing it as molly in capsules; if I put it in one of my medication bottles, do you think they&#039;d bother checking? I&#039;ve taken my legal meds onto cruises before with no problems. I could also sandwich it with passion flower capsules, though they&#039;re a different size so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;d be more suspicious.<br /><br />The alternative is to shove both in plastic up my ass or keep it in my crotch, though I don&#039;t want to raise more suspicion.<br /><br />Any thoughts or experience? I&#039;d really love to roll on the open sea, or in one of the nightclubs.<br /><br />EDIT: I was thinking this would be quite easy but then I remembered I&#039;ll be taking a flight to take the cruise. That scares me far more than cruise security.<br />If I choose to risk it, would putting the drugs in a non-carry on luggage bag be safer than attempting to get it through security for carry on?<br /><br />EDIT 2: Plane&#039;s no longer relevant! I&#039;ve decided to take the train, it&#039;ll be cheaper and require far less security dodging.

				Haha I was asking the same question to myself a couple months ago. Let me tell you: Easy. As. Fuck.<br />Went on a Carnival Cruise in February I believe, but since all I had in my stash at the time was weed, I decided not to risk it. Would&#039;ve brought some acid or even shrooms, but couldn&#039;t score in time. And I would&#039;ve made it too. All they did was a metal detector and scanned your carry-ons; I could have even brought my sack of Jack The Ripper in my pockets! No dogs, only a couple cops. So I remained sober on the cruise (don&#039;t drink) until the 3rd or so day; bought some pot in a South American country and smuggled it aboard no problem, smoked on that stuff for the rest of the cruise. And then of course I brought my resinous pipe in my pocket through the exit check, and made it through there, too.

				As far as LSD goes it&#039;s pretty easy to sneakily stash it away. I&#039;ve had success with putting MDMA in supplement bottles inside a toiletterie bag. LSD is a piece of cake, just squeeze it in the neck of a book. <br /><br />Disclaimer that the highest security this has passed through is land borders, so not a plane or a cruise ship, but as far as the LSD goes I&#039;d definitely feel pretty confident.

				Alright, people posting- can you differentiate between plane (which would be national, in the USA, through TSA guards) and the cruise ship? I&#039;m actually not all too scared about the cruise ship at all anymore- now I&#039;m more concerned about getting it their on the flight there.<br /><br />Any tips/experience with getting small amounts of LSD/MDMA on a plane- be it through TSA on-board luggage checks, or simply through luggage stored in the planes baggage area?

				In my experience (6 or 7 times) they do minimal checking when you board a cruise ship - compared to air travel. Its the flight you should worry about. You could probably walk onto a ship with it in your hand they&#039;re so lax about it&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />As other people have said, the LSD should be fine in a book or something, or if you&#039;re worried about your bag getting a random search, maybe somewhere a little more creative?&nbsp; <br /><br />I really don&#039;t think theres any fool proof way to smuggle when travelling by plane. I&#039;ve managed to walk through with half a bag of ketamine in my top pocket - get all the way there - and then realise! A lot of people seem to have a preference for plugging stuff like mdma or pills though. So maybe thats the safest way? <br /><br />

				I went on a Carnival cruise not too long ago, I had a pocket full of pills. There is more security if you are getting off in another country and getting back on so leave it on the boat.<br /><br />You go through a metal detector. A dog was present too but he never got close to me. LSD will be easy. MDMA, if its white you could reseal Goody powder packets or something. I would put the las in a small bag with a lot of stickers/stamps or other pieces of paper. Good luck

				dude just get a bottle of vitamin C capsules for 7 dollars and put the MDMA capsules in the bottom of the bottle!!<br />extra points if you can stuff the cotton into the vitamin bottle and make it look still sealed. They WILL NOT make you pour out all your vitamin C pills because one of the capsules might have mdma.. I had a buddy who did this and he got arrested for drunk driving and for a bag of weed and he had a whole bottle of mdma capsules in a vitamin bottle. the cop was a NARC and kept asking him if it was drugs in the capsules and he kept laughing at them and told them they were idiots. They just tossed the bottle back into the car and he spent a nite in the cell overnight

				Shitttttttttt.!!!! Smuggling drugs on board is the only thing that makes long distance travel bearable!<br /><br />They ARE NOT looking for drugs!!<br /><br />They&#039;re looking for weapons, but if they find drugs obviously you&#039;re in trouble.<br /><br />Be smart, use your heads &amp; enjoy the ride!! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Can&#039;t say for MDMA, as it&#039;s always sucked for me. <br /><br />LSD, now that&#039;s the real deal. <br /><br />Probably the EASIEST thing to smuggle anywhere! - You carry a wallet? - Bet you got a bunch of useless business cards in there.<br /><br />In those little plastic sleeves that hold cards, just slip a sheet of Hoffmans in there. Might want to use wax paper on either side of it. <br /><br />It&#039;s just going to look like some stupid card in your wallet. <br /><br />But man, the trips you will have! - I had been out of the tripping game for 20 years, and recently got a free sheet from a Dutch seller as a bonus for ordering when they were new sellers, and giving a good review on forums. (It pays to be a good customer! ;D)<br /><br />I finally tried them on a beautiful 80 degree day here in NYC, and me and an old bud from High School met up for in Central Park. It was the cleanest I ever had! - Colors breathing with the trees! Not too heavy, but super great hallucinations. None of that sickly feeling you get with MDMA and the other MDxx&#039;s. <br /><br />Stick with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. You can&#039;t go wrong. <br /><br />Peace 8)

				Plane&#039;s no longer relevant! Decided to take the train.<br /><br />So, if I tuck some molly capsules into an empty prescription bottle (or into a bottle of vitamins with a similar capsule, which might be less suspicious?) with some dryer sheets and deodorant near it, thing that&#039;ll work alright for cruise security? I&#039;m not sure how well dogs can smell molly- I presume they&#039;re mostly trained for cannabis?

				I have carried all kinds of pills (MDMA, LSD, Oxy,) onto both planes and cruise ships without issue.&nbsp; Get a supplement bottle and throw them in the mix.&nbsp; People carry so many damn pills around with them these days they&#039;re never going to take the time to open your bags, look through your pill bottles and then ask you what each one is.&nbsp; AND even if they did how are they going to know for sure that you don&#039;t have a script, at least for the prescription ones?&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t try to take crack or weed or something that is very obviously illegal along but anything in pill form should be okay.

				Oh also my buddy once brought edibles, weed, and her whole smoking bag (pipes, lighters, eye drops, hemp wick [Beeline&nbsp; :D]) while flying across 1/4th of the country. She has a medical marijuana card and she didn&#039;t have any problems at all. She even got a note that TSA or whatever checked her bag (although, I&#039;m not positive it was the bag her smoking bag was in). But I do emphasize she has a mmj card.

				Smuggling small quantities is not a big deal at all. I&#039;ve traveled (plane) with capsules of mushroom powder and capsules of weed in a prescription bottle with a one-hitter wrapped in saran wrap. Just don&#039;t look shady and no one cares. Once I stupidly left a capsule of weed in my pockets and went through security and didn&#039;t get stopped. They&#039;re much more interested in finding bombs and weapons than drugs.

Its also helpful in measuring dosages if you just remember how much you put in each case. I also had some NBOMe in aluminum foil that I just put in a pack of gum. Then I had an alprazolam and proylene glycol solution (250 mg, 125 mL respectively) that I just put in a small sport bottle. On the way back, I wadded some MDMA in a gum wrapper and put it with the rest of the NBOMe. I checked the 2c-i and alprazolam but had the NBOMe and MDMA in my carry on. TSA even pulled me aside for further searching (checked my bag a little and scanned my phone with some sort of wand using microwaves the agent said) and I was still good to go. Lol

				I decided to leave my &#039;Vitamins&#039; in my checked-in luggage for the cruise... I put the MDMA in the capsule of a legitimate vitamin that I poured out, and it matched the color and texture almost exactly.<br /><br />My luggage arrived late to the room. It was the most nerve wracking five hours of my life; I presumed my vacation would be with the local police, given how I saw a gigantic &quot;Drug Free Zone&quot; sign right after handing off my baggage.<br /><br />Yet it all worked out perfectly and I had a fantastic time; I don&#039;t regret it at all. Hell, security seemed lax enough that you could&#039;ve probably smuggled some foreign purchased substances off the ship while leaving; granted the ship didn&#039;t exactly travel to a country known for its drug imports, but sneaking some Cubans back would&#039;ve been easy.

				I have never brought illegal drugs through US airport security, but I have flown dozens upon dozens of times over 10 years with legitimate multivatimins in both my carry-on and checked baggage every goddamn time.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a really strong sample size of US domestic flights, and a solid smaller sample size of international flights, including some &quot;interesting&quot; countries.&nbsp; <br /><br />I keep these various and completely unmarked vitamin pills in those clear plastic old lady daily pill type containers.&nbsp; I take multiple supplements every day so it just makes sense to get them out of the retail bottles and into these containers.<br /><br />You would think this would appear suspicious.&nbsp; I mean, I would call it a decent reason for a closer look from TSA and I am on the drug abuser side of things here.<br /><br />I have never once had any TSA or international person comment, inspect, or perhaps even notice (?) these clear plastic containers filled with dozens of unmarked vitamins.&nbsp; These include solid classic vitamins, but also the type of herbal supplement that is fine powder in a gel cap.&nbsp; Again, all perfectly legal.&nbsp; It even includes some smaller pills that may be mistaken for some sort of generic script type drugs.&nbsp; I carry no documentation of what these pills are - ie I don&#039;t bring the GNC bottle with me.<br /><br />To be clear:&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t include anything that resembles a tiny wonderful and commonly abused pill e.g. an oxycodone IR or Xanax bar or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />It occurs to me:&nbsp; how many fliers are carrying on a personal supply of legit benzos to handle their anxiety, without documentation of their legit script?&nbsp; How many are carrying all kinds of legit prescription drugs on planes without documentation?&nbsp; Perhaps this is just not a good area for TSA to focus?<br /><br />Something to consider.&nbsp; Word to the wise.
