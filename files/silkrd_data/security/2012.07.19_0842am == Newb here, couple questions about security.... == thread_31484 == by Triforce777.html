				I am new here and am enticed at opportunity available, but I just want to make sure I am doing this as safe as possible.&nbsp; I read the guide, have liberte on a usb, created pgp keys and understand how to use it just fine, am generally ok.....but I have one question.&nbsp; I first accessed SR through Tor on my computer, not through liberte on my usb drive.&nbsp; Am I at any risk by having first browsed SR on my computer and not through liberte?&nbsp; All I did was create a username and browse.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

				Tor on your pc is just as safe as it is on Liberte when using the browser bundle. nothing to worry.<br />Also accessing the site is not illegal.<br /><br />I guess you have already made a new SR account (even though that wasnt necessary) out of paranoia, so really, theres nothing to worry if you dont even buy something with the old account.
