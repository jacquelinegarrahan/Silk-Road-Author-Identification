				I&#039;m sure of heard of some users keeping all their passwords safe in some online place. I would like to try this out but I just can&#039;t remember where they said. Any input would be great. Thanx

Thanx<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I&#039;m pretty much an online guy, and I use Tails on main forum, which means I have to save passwords and pgp keys somewhere, and I prefer online, tho I also use a lazyman&#039;s flash drive...encrypted is best...but like I said, lazyman ;) ....already getting slack...but anyway:<br /><br />First you kind of need to see how you want to keep your passwords: see I also need a place to keep my onion urls, and usernames, and I prefer using keepassx for this, then just saving a file in their kdb format...now you could use just regular keepass--it might be keepass2 by this time--but my problem is that I use linux--Tails is a linux distro, but for the forums I use windows, and keepassx is the easiest for me....and then I just save all my pgp keys to an *.asc file....and that&#039;s pretty much all I need...some good online storage sites are dropbox, wuala, and swissdisk.&nbsp; I find swissdisk shows up better in Tor, however...dropbox is also way to &#039;official&#039; and popular and friendly to LE for my taste, so I don&#039;t use them for anything &#039;interesting&#039;...<br /><br />I need, on a sidenote--since I&quot;m a tails fan, that unless you update tails, you can&#039;t apt-get install keepassx<br /><br />Now if you use just regular keepass--like I used to--you can save/export the files in an html format, I believe, and then just save them that way: so I open up Tails, then immediately login, make sure I&quot;m online, then I can go to my storage site and download the two files I need...you could get them both in one folder if it suits you....all kinds of ways to do this....hell, you could just save your passwords and such as a text file and just use that...and good advice is to encrypt all this too, then save it...also, if you do use bitcoins on your desktop save your wallet.dat too...me, I just use instawallet....<br /><br />So whenever I first run Tails, I need to get all my stuff squared away, downloaded and get my pgp keys and install keepassx and then get everything and roll...<br /><br />I usually open a root terminal, and run apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install keepassx .... but gotta make sure you are connected online....this is also handy when tails starts needing updates for security reasons...right now they just put out the latest version, so updates aren&#039;t vital for security...but I do it anyway, mostly so I can get keepassx...<br /><br />good luck :)<br /><br />good luck :)

I eventually settled on a program called pySafe. I would recomend it to any N900 user. Keeps all yer passwords, urls, and usernames safe with just one password. This way there is no need to save a password or url in yer browser.

				https://cryptedmemo.com/ is my preferred option. Data is encrypted on client side using AES.<br />For remembering important passwords (such as my cryptedmemo passphrase), I&#039;m using a mnemonic system based on easy associations summarized on an inconspicuous image. Be creative.
