				Twice when I ordered from bitinstant the order didn&#039;t go through.&nbsp; I emailed their support email and the woman fixed it very quickly.<br /><br />You should try that by now if 10 hours have passed.<br /><br />Btw I know bitcoins have been rising for a while....but today was like no other day.&nbsp; $41 per bitcoin!&nbsp; I&#039;ve made so much money just letting my bitcoins sit after depositing the other day.

				I&#039;ve used BitInstant like 20+ times and the only time I ever had an issue was when doing Cash (ZipZap) to MtGox.&nbsp; Usually Cash to Bitcoin address happens immediately--like the transaction hits my wallet just before the receipt prints at the counter, which is pretty fuckin awesome.&nbsp; For some reason the deposit to MtGox didn&#039;t go through.&nbsp; I emailed their support and within an hour the funds were deposited manually on their end.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard some horror stories, but it seems that generally, their support team is very quick to resolve issues.<br /><br />And yeah, @incognito22, WTF is going on with the bitcoin price today!?!?&nbsp; I&#039;m not complaining--the value of my wallet went up like $1000 in 24 hours.&nbsp; I bought-in last month and again a couple weeks ago, but I&#039;ve been resisting the urge to buy on SR just so I can watch my coins become more and more valuable.&nbsp; Might be able to pay off my mortgage in a couple weeks at this rate!&nbsp; ;-)

The only options I see are; VirVox, MtGox, VouchX, Paypal and BitStamp. There used to be just Bitcoin address option and one would shoot it straight to any wallet services like instawallet..etc.<br /><br />So again, how did you manage to do money gram straight to Bitcoin address is beyond me, unless we are seeing 2 different things. BTW, why are you shooting your coins to MrGox? Don&#039;t they require some form of authentication? all I know is that MtGox is highly NOT-Recommended here in SR.

				For a short period in the late afternoon, the deposit option bitcoin to bitcoin address was available. However, the option went away after being up for no more than 30 minutes. I was able to use this option and went to my local store to pay my deposit. I am now in the same situation as the person who originated the post. I have never had issues with Bitinstant and my deposits displayed in my account within an hour. It&#039;s been 15 hours now for me. I emailed support and waiting to hear back. I really hope this gets resolved...

				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Anyone who uses BitInstant ever again is a fucking moron. They have been unreliable for several months, and have been down for the last couple weeks. When they come back they admit they got hacked and lost thousands of dollars. There are several threads explaining all the viable alternatives and people are still throwing their cash at these fucking BitInstant idiots? Sorry, but you got what you deserved.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care if they&#039;re perfect from here on out for 10 years or more. They&#039;re never touching another cent of mine.

				Trader Joes... Have you emailed bit instant support or heard anything from them? Sounds like we are in the same boat. I&#039;ve emailed support this morning but haven&#039;t heard anything as of yet. Getting nervous and hoping they make things right. What steps have you taken so far? Should I contact SR support? Keep me posted on your situation. Hope it all gets worked out for both of us!

				Also waiting for transaction to go through.. Its been almost 24 hours since they got my $$. Its pretty annoying considering I tried to send funds the last week with no success. Since the direct deposit option was down I tried BitStamp and that didn&#039;t work either. at that point for whatever reason the last part of the transaction wasn&#039;t completing (people at counter couldn&#039;t process and take the cash, computers wouldn&#039;t load information). So going on day six of seven I told them I shouldn&#039;t be charged for any fee. So far like other people here i haven&#039;t heard from them today... Last time I heard from them was yesterday in the late afternoon MST. I cant believe those fuckers didn&#039;t tell me the truth about the breach of security. I was under the impression they were updating or actually doing maintenance. If any of you guys get your coinage let us know here , I&#039;ll do the same. <br /><br />

				Finally received my coins. Happy to get them back but will not be using BitInstant ever again. Anyone else that had the issue with Cash Deposit to Btc Address, the only <br />was to resolve the issue is to give them an alternative way to deposit your coin... Mt Gox account, Btc Voucher etc. They aren&#039;t able to directly deposit coins in your account for whatever <br />reason, no answers on their end. After all was said and done I lost about $70 in exchange fees, transfer etc... too bad because if I&#039;d have had my coin on time I would have <br />made a few hundred bucks. Good luck.

				Trader Joes is right, if you are trying to deposit coins directly into a btc wallet i would let them know you want it sent to a mt.gox bitstamp etc like trader joes said. i think its the only way to get the show on the road

				Haha Rachel is the woman! She helped me too when I had the same issue.<br /><br />The only problem with bitfloor is I get weird looks and bad attitudes when I go into BOA and try to make an out of state deposit.&nbsp; But I guess I shouldn&#039;t give a motherfuck anyway.

				Incognito22<br /><br />Tell them you want to make a cash deposit to your stockbroker. They are a stockbroker too. I&#039;ve never had anything but good attitudes going in to BOA. Today is twice now for me for BitFloor, it&#039;s all good.

				Forgot to update, but I did receive my bitcoins last week. Once I used the live chat option at the bottom of the page, got a response in 20 minutes. I gave Rachel my mtgox account info since the direct deposit to bitcoin wallet was not working and received my bitcoins quickly after that. <br />I hope everyone else got their bitcoins who were waiting. :)

				I just rolled the dice on BitInstant, dang it...<br /><br />I&#039;ve used it a few times before, and when the bitcoin address went away I sent it to Bitstamp which worked alright, even faster<br />But then Bitstamp option went away too<br /><br />I saw the bitcoin address option again and just used it&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; Mainly cuz I only had 20 minutes or so to make a drop-<br /><br />BitFloor uses BoA which the closest one is across town and isn&#039;t going to work for me<br />I&#039;d fuckin love to just use the drive thru at a Chase, which I read BitMe accepts, but their site isn&#039;t accepting new users... lame<br />Not even getting outta the car would be awesome<br /><br /><br />Keepin&#039; my fingers crossed<br />I&#039;ll let ya know...<br /><br />

				Well, in the time it took me to get my posts over 50 to be able to post the above, BitInstant delivered<br /><br />So, it took about an hour I&#039;d guess<br /><br />Whew!
