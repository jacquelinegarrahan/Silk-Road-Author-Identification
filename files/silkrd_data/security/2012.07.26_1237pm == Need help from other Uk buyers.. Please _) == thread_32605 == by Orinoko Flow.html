				I use MTGOX all you have to do is deposit you cash at any Barclays banks. The only concern i have is using&nbsp; your own ip address but you can get around this by going into a pub with free WIFI and setting up your email account and Mtgox account. But you have to remember to go back to the pub to convert the cash to bitcoins.<br />Hope this helps

				Sounds like ori is in the same boat as me. Intersango have got 200 of my hard earned and I can not do a fuckng thing about it, so I am looking for other avenues. The good thing about them was I could transfer in the morning and have it in my account in the afternoon but this latest shit is putting me right off. I can only afford to stock up every couple of weeks and when I have the spare cash I want to see &quot;in transit&quot; but if Vlad can get it in my sr account in the time of first class post I might give him a try.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Use vldad, he is proper, I know you probably think that sending cash through the post is absolutely ridiculous and so un-safe, but vldad is a businessman and trustworthy also if you change a lot he looks after you on the rate.<br /><br />hope this helps!!

As long as you put the Bitcoins that Mt.

Not to mention completely anonymous.
