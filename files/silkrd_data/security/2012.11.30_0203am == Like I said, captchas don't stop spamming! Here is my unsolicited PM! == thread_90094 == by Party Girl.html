				Eh, it&#039;s not perfect but it&#039;s about 20fold better.<br /><br />If you&#039;re so bothered by clicking the delete button you can change your settings to not appear online when you&#039;re logged in. That should stop any messages from spammers.

				Of course it is an improvement.&nbsp; Also, I am not &quot;bothered&quot; by clicking the delete button.&nbsp; If you have not worked with SMF, you have no idea of it&#039;s potential.&nbsp; It takes about a few minutes and presto, no PM&#039;ing until your 100 post either if we are going to set these parameters.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luv,<br />PG.

				Just go to setting and make it so it always shows you as offline. I do agree with you on all of this, but it&#039;s going to be a process. They aren&#039;t just going to implement stuff right away. They are probably testing to see what works and what doesn&#039;t.

				When you look at the list of people who get mass PMed, it&#039;s obvious that he copy-pastes the list of online people at the bottom of the main page. Setting yourself as always offline completely fixes the problem.

				The issue is not whether is will improve things as much as how there are better ways and 100 post is obscene to remove them.&nbsp; I agree, anything is better than nothing for the present!&nbsp; However, do you really think a large % of scammers is going to fill out at least 25 or 50 manually captchas just to be banned within hours?&nbsp; I don&#039;t.&nbsp; They will move on.<br /><br />SMF is so extensible a total captcha environment is not really necessary if you configure the forum correctly.&nbsp; That is my only point and hopefully this was just a stop-gap measure.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;

				He hasn&#039;t PM&#039;d me yet. I notice he&#039;s targeting the oldtimers like you. I&#039;m too young and unimportant to be harassed on PM. Have you told DPR or admin? I&#039;ve noticed plenty of discussion on this parasite (it&#039;s not me btw) but there should be a way to complain. I have no idea why the problem is still like this. <br /><br />Good luck with it. He&#039;s a real jerk (spammer not DKR). Unlimited love and all that crap to you. Piece out. Drive safely. Remember to eat something. <br /><br />(Speaking of PMing people, still no word pine.
