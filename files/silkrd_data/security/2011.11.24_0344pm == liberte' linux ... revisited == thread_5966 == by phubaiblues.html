				http://dee.su/liberte<br /><br />Just opinion here, of course:&nbsp; I always think when you are new, that you should come to forums, and learn how to use PGP and where and how to get bitcoins...and mostly, I try to encourage and help people in downloading TOR from https://www.torproject.org/ ... get a good &#039;feel&#039; for all this, read thru the security forums.&nbsp; Another site I&#039;m on, people ask me periodically how to get on SR, and I always say: come to forums first, and I show them how to do this....<br /><br />But once they&#039;ve been here a while, and learn what we are about, and what we are up against, and perhaps make a few orders, maybe, like me, they want more protection.&nbsp; I went from there to Tails: http://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html<br />For my bookmarks and usernames and urls and passwords I keep a file stashed in an online database.&nbsp; I keep it in kdb format, in keepassx, but it can be just as easily kept in a text file...to use keepassx in Tails, I have to first update it--not a bad practice anyway--and then download and install keepassx...so it&#039;s a quite a bit of xtra work, and may not be worth it to most.<br /><br />There are also excellent other ways of protection, with virtual machines, which I&#039;ve done, but don&#039;t consider myself qualified to show others on that.&nbsp; So I went first to Tails, then to Privatix for main site: in forums I&#039;m more comfortable using regular Tor browser...it&#039;s all legal and just chit chat...<br /><br />But last few days I&#039;d had hell of a time getting on main site, with Tails.&nbsp; So I went back to liberte&#039; linux, and it connected with few problems.&nbsp; I&#039;d forgotten how handy liberte can be, as I don&#039;t need to get any xtra files from anywhere, because of the persistence they provide.<br /><br />That&#039;s the reason I&#039;m mentioning it again, as there have been newcomers who have contacted me about Tails, and have asked about how to keep persistent data.&nbsp; Simply, for all practical purposes, you *can&#039;t*: Tails is designed to be anonymous...some people in some countries very lives and freedom are at stake, and they never know when the knock on the door may come, and with Tails, once click and it erases everything, so you have no trail.&nbsp; Even on here, we can see the value of such a device.<br /><br />But anyway, last couple days, I&#039;ve been using liberte again, and it&#039;s such a valuable app, for those who really want to keep some persistant data storage: everything is kept in this one encrypted folder, and it worked fine for me, and I wanted to remind anyone who is having a hassle with tails, to give liberte a second chance.<br /><br />My problems with liberte have been minor: didn&#039;t particularly care for the browser, but it&#039;s not a big deal...the other problem is that I can&#039;t get the mouse cursor to &#039;slow down&#039;&nbsp; I have xp with a keypad, and I can use it ok, if I&#039;m willing to plug in my portable mouse, but even if go to &#039;mouse&#039; settings, I can get it to slow down...but it&#039;s good enough for main site, and worked fine last couple days, when nothing else seemed to be getting thru...I still think it was just some tor identity problems, but anyway, wondered if anyone else was using liberte still, and what they thought of it....

				Regarding persistent data on Tails: isn&#039;t it possible to modify the .iso by placing some files in the Home folder before burning it? It wouldn&#039;t be very practical if you need to modify the data frequently, but for PGP keys and such it should be fine.<br />I will give Liberte Linux a try to see how they compare.

				I think Liberte is probably more secure than Tails, in addition to being more convenient, at least when used correctly.
