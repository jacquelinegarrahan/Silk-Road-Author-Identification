				What would be the best way to go about this? I have cash in hand, and am eager to get some bitcoins. I planned on going with BST, but they&#039;re consistently sold out, and are taking early orders for the 11th. I want my bitcoins and I want them now!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Did you create your alias out of thin air? Name, phone number, etc. Did you pick a name out of the phonebook?

				I just make up all the info. Fake everything. They never check. Just remember what you entered, it will have to match when you fill out your Money Gram papers.

But, i have had no problems using Bitinstant ever in my history. <br />Bitinstant used to be great when you could deposit at bank of america, like bst. and with bst being backed up for days recently. Bitinstant isn&#039;t so bad <br /><br />You should really calm down, i don&#039;t know what acting like an edgy teenager accomplishes?&nbsp;

				Just create a decent sounding fake name, phone number, DOB, address in the local area of your deposit,(apartment building preferably) and tormail for your fake name. Now try to remember this info. You may need to give the teller your phone number in order to pull up your transaction info on the computer. Also, if they cannot figure that out sometimes they will ask for all the rest of your information in order to pull up the transaction. Just be sure you remember it in case you are asked. If they ask for ID just find another location and tell them that you are using this service because you do not have these types of things. Works for me every time. Also, make sure you save all the transaction info bitinstant and zipzap give you in case you have to make a claim due to their error. Good luck!
