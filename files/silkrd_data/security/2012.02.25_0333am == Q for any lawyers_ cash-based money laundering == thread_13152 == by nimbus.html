				I have this question, and don&#039;t know if there is a good answer. Can anyone help?<br /><br />When does something technically become money laundering? You can buy anything anonymously for cash, or trade it for any foreign currency. If you keep the amounts small, maybe a few hundred bucks at a time, certainly that is legal?

				Definition for money laundering:<br />Web definitions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concealing the source of illegally gotten money.<br />wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn<br /><br />As long as the money is dirty, trying to &#039;clean&#039; it in any way *is* money laundering.

				So if I am only on the buyer&#039;s side here, nothing I am doing could be considered money laundering, since the &quot;source&quot; of all my money is legit? Doesn&#039;t seem right to me, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a legal gray area or something.

The best think to do is buy LR then back to btc and back to LR then to WM or buy Iraqi money and exchange at an airport.. idk I tried
