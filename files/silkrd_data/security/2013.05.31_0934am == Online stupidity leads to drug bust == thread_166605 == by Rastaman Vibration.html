				<br />New York<br />Authorities dismantled a Manhattan coke ring that catered to the snow habits of the wealthy with door-to-door service — at $120 a gram — after a ringleader boasted on social media about living the high life.<br /><br />Big-mouth accused kingpin Adrian (Ace) Rivera, 24, sparked the investigation when undercover cops began purchasing large amounts of cocaine from him in early 2011, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Friday in announcing the takedown.<br /><br />But investigators only knew him by his nickname. They searched social media and soon found his Facebook and Instagram accounts, which they used as a jumping off point for their online sleuthing.<br /><br />The investigation eventually led to the indictment of Rivera and 40 alleged members of three street gangs — the “Money Boyz,” “Blocc Boyz” and the “Stack Gang” — that operated out of housing projects in the lower East Side.<br /><br />By following Rivera’s online tracks, investigators learned he often bragged on social media about partying with his stripper girlfriend, Krista Zuniga, at Perfection, a jiggle joint near LaGuardia Airport in Queens. Rivera regularly met with his crew at the Queens strip club.<br /><br />As they continued to dig into Rivera’s online world, aided by his online bragging, they found he was operating a drug business that sold more than $1 million worth of cocaine over the two years that followed the beginning of the probe.<br /><br />“He was quite popular on social media, often flashing gang signs and cash ... and associating himself with known street crews on the lower East Side,” Kelly said.<br /><br />&nbsp;Rivera’s network included more than a dozen livery cab drivers and runners, who would deliver coke to a clientele ranging from investment bankers to college students, Kelly added.<br /><br />“As this indictment reveals, residents of Manhattan today can get nearly everything delivered to their doorstep — from dinner to dry cleaning, and even cocaine,” Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. said at Friday’s press conference.<br /><br />The blow was marked up significantly from the typical street value of the drug, about $80 a gram.<br /><br />The “Money Boyz,” “Blocc Boyz” and the “Stack Gang” all run out of three housing projects: the Baruch, Jacob Riis and Campos Houses.<br /><br />The crews were sometimes at odds with each other, law enforcement sources said, but all were getting a piece of the action from the ring’s high-priced product.<br /><br />Most of the 41 alleged pushers who were indicted as a result of the investigation were arrested Friday and were expected to be arraigned throughout the day Friday.<br /><br />“All of these defendants are a part of a narcotics organization, or group, that has made a tremendous amount of money distributing narcotics throughout the city of New York as well as upstate and New Jersey,” Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Michelle Warren said at an arraignment Friday morning.

				if you want to avoid getting arrested, just keep your mouth shut. <br />is it really that hard to comprehend that one should not boast about the gains from illegal activities? it&#039;s common sense. <br />if you don&#039;t have a job that pays all that well and start driving around in expensive cars for example, you&#039;re going to end up drawing unwanted attention. <br />

				I bet LE is on here buying all the time.&nbsp; It&#039;s always these ones that just go around bragging.&nbsp; IDGI, why can&#039;t they just get on reddit via TOR and brag there?&nbsp; If they must show their &quot;high life,&quot; blur out any incriminating anything and flash your money.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that hard...

				And this is why I canceled all my social media accounts long long time ago and get off the proverbial grid. I watched this Detective Documentary and they literally busted people cause the perps would go onto social media brag about their crimes and then post on a friends wall if they were meeting them at a certain club and at what time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Apparently getting into a life of crime has a low entry level. I&#039;m not a criminal besides the fact that I buy drugs but that&#039;s another story but it&#039;s just astonishing the amount of personal information people put out on the internet. Maybe I&#039;m an alarmist but one day the free love of info that people feel the need to share on the internet with strangers will come back to bite them in the ass. Mark my words!

				You missed my point. If LE received their tipoff in a way that was not absolutely iron clad, then their basis for obtaining a search warrant may be fraudulent. If that&#039;s the case and he didn&#039;t incriminate himself, then all of the evidence gathered therein will be inadmissible. &quot;Fruit of a poison tree&quot;. The whole case would collapse.
