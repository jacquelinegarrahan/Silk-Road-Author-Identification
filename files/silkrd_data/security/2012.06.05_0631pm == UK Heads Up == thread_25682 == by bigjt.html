				Hey guys,just wanted to give you all a quick heads up,mainly for people in the UK i guess,a friend of mine said that the Police have been round to see him asking about his Internet activity,he said they knew about SR,now i dont know the whole thing he only sent me a quick text and has not replied back to mine,i have been thinking and my guess is that someone who supplied him something got busted and they got his details off his pc,or could they have been tracking my friends activity?? this has concerned me as i have letters inbound due to arrive anytime,anybody got any thoughts on this??

				Sounds like bullshit to me.<br /><br />He&#039;s obviously been blagging to his skag head friends (who are all informants by the way) &quot;oh yeah I found some amazing site called Silk Road&quot; and they tipped the police off.<br /><br />You address get&#039;s deleted as soon as the sender puts it into transit, and he should be using PGP anyway so there&#039;s no concern there. The UK Police can&#039;t infiltrate SR or Tor unless they were pretending to be a seller, which legally they can&#039;t do as they can&#039;t supply drugs, he didn&#039;t order anything off a new seller with no feedback did he then get an empty package?<br /><br />People use some common sense.

				My thoughts are ... sounds like BS. LE monitoring his TOR activity isn&#039;t very likely, a vendor being busted who kept records of his customers ... if one existed, I guess, hopefully no vendors are that incompetent. Either scenario doesn&#039;t put you in danger, unless you ordered from the same busted vendor.

				its deffo a myth or wishfulll thinking that all vendors dont have record of addresses after in transit ive seen a few times people asking the vendor to make sure they sent to right addy when late and they check so they must keep some record till transactions finished<br /><br /><br />i did it when 1 of mine was late and i had FE and he told me what address hed sent to a week after in transit and i never sent pgp<br /><br />no im not saying which 1 .i bet 90% do and when someone scams saying never arrrived they want to no that address and look out for it and warn others so must have record till transaction finished

It could create a code every time you mount the encrypted partition containing buyers details which you would need to log into Silk Road as a vendor. Or perhaps make it so you simply couldn&#039;t log into Silk Road as vendor unless the site detected you were running a properly full drive encrypted OS. This of course would require some kind of Tor compromising script or firefox addon, but it would only be sending data to and from the Silk Road site so not insecure.

				...its being reported that uk met are taking info from suspects mobiles (cellphones) which seems to include those being &quot;questioned&quot;, call<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;history and messages were mentioned but as we know theres more than just the 2 esp iphones which have location db {depending on<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;whether you&#039;ve managed to switch this off etc}, and what stops an officer taking copies of ANY data on a phone even if its just the 2 items they<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;are legally allowed access to ?!<br />

				I can tell you what I&#039;ve said on here previously.<br /><br />I don&#039;t work directly with the Police any more but my bank has to file reports for suspicious account activities and as such we occasionally liaise with specialists from drug task forces and financial crimes units.<br /><br />The last two senior officers I spoke to seemed unaware of the concept of Bitcoins altogether. I am sure they&#039;re aware of Silk Road vicariously but considering the difficulty of mastering even the basic concepts of using it, I doubt we have much to worry about.<br /><br />I know this because in my experience the Police seem to have only the most basic degree of computer literacy at best. Any complex work involving digital forensics and so on seems to be farmed out to the private sector on a regular basis rather than be managed in house, mainly I think because it&#039;s cheaper to do that on an ad hoc basis than train and maintain the knowledge of your own officers.<br /><br />Admittedly I don&#039;t speak to people in SOCA or live in a major Metropolitan area so there may well be more tech savvy officers out there but the degree of cunning and resourcefulness required to detect someone&#039;s activities on here is huge, provided a person takes the reasonable precaution of encrypting their machine, only using the Tor browser and GPG to arrange purchases, obtaining Bitcoins anonymously and so on.<br /><br />I have also read a little of the literature related to AML (Anti Money Laundering) procedures as supplied to the Police and have yet to find any reference to Onion Routing, P2P Currencies or the Silk Road.<br /><br />Of course we shouldn&#039;t be complacent - we have the upper hand for now but we&#039;re aware of the weaknesses and should always make sure we&#039;re vigilant against potential visits by the Police. <br /><br />V.<br /><br />

If this is a problem you can use a &quot;bridge&quot; to obscure your Tor traffic. More information about this on request.<br /><br />I keep an eye on the Crimeline periodical in the UK which details new legal issues for Criminal Defence Solicitors. Not one case I have seen so far in the three years I&#039;ve been reading it involves intercepted Tor traffic. Indeed this kind of evidence is inadmissible in UK courts as Security Services argue it would reveal too much about their methods to allow it.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

Since when does anyone say &quot;Hold on inspector, can you wait a few seconds while I just rub magnets over my hard drive so I can delete all the incriminating evidence please, you just go and make a cup of tea and take a seat and then you can take me in&quot; also you aren&#039;t taking into account that not everyone does every single security step there is and some people are stupid and could give in to the pigs. What you do is run upstairs and flush all your shit or maybe you don&#039;t even think that far ahead and just freeze, it all depends on the individual. <br /><br />Also you haven&#039;t taken into account the possibility he had no time. What if it did happen and they kicked down the door when he was out or in the bath or in the middle of banging his Mrs. Don&#039;t leave you much room for maneuver.<br /><br />It&#039;s not realistic to talk about what people SHOULD do. It&#039;s what people ACTUALLY do that means anything in these situations. <br /><br />Anyway DPR got in touch with me, will update ya shortly.

				Always worth keeping a rare earth magnet handy though in case you can get to the hard drive.<br /><br />I always liked the solution used in Cryptonomicon. Wire up an electromagnet that runs around the inside of your front door, that way if you get raided the police will assist in wiling your harddrives as they carry your equipment out. It may take some finessing to allow you yo activate it when the police arrive but im sure it woukd be possible.<br /><br />When will we get that update from DPR Lim?
