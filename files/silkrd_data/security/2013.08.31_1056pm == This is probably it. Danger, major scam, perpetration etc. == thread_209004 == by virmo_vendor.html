				Ok, so we had a perfect reputation, things were going well.<br />We had some people FE and were going to make them very happy the next days.<br /><br />We seperated private life with SR, now we didnt and now we lost a bizarre amount of money. Wives will find out, rent and food can not be paid for anymore and the coolest thing is: we&#039;re never alone. Always these black cars, or car, but with a different licence plate, following/observing us.<br /><br />We were happy to ship diethyl ether, which is impossible because it&#039;s 1: in glass, 2: highly flamable and 3: possibly explosive.<br /><br />We tried several options, paid for that ourselves, all for nothing.<br />It cant be put in hdpe either... so.. not gonna work....<br /><br />Not sure anymore if we had it on our profile but we never refund/reship only on case by case basis.<br />Old virmo had a 0% refund/reship policy. Which was fine because prices were as low as they could be and everything arrived and was of the best quality.<br />We also have this policy but we&#039;re not sure if we copied that....<br /><br /><br />But that does not matter... People can want refunds, we dont have any btcs so we can not give anythung...<br /><br />Our perfect rep will be totally fucked...<br /><br />But most importantly: who the fuck are these guys? why do they observe? what should we do?<br />Haha...we have no cash... but we need guns with silencers now... and this is wayyyyyyy to extreme for us....<br /><br /><br />We try not to walk alone.. <br /><br />But even if that was not real... (yes no hallucination.. we have security cams low quality no night vision...)<br />How the hell are we going to pay for rent and food and not be killed by partners?!<br /><br /><br />Yeah it was fun, a few bucks on the side, some experimentation.. perhaps some lab equip and chem basics and now it all turned into hell and we have no clue how to deal with this, or with customers being angry...<br /><br />We never scammed. We love arrivals and people having fun... and now this will fuck everything up....<br /><br />Perhaps better not to go on sr anymore... But what the fuck to do with these guys in the cars?<br />We can call cops, give licence plate number.. yeah stolen.. then they&#039;re gone.. then they are there again, new fake shit... what do they want?<br />We&#039;re not even big fish, people cant steal a lot from us... are they just psychos?

				Nothing you have said makes any sense.&nbsp; Is it because of the language barrier? Just type in your own language so that we can translate it.<br /><br />If it weren&#039;t for the fact that you actually are a vendor I would think you are just trolling.
