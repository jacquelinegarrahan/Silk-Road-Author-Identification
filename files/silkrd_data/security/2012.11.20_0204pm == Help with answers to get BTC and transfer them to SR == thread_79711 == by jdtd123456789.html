				Hey everyone.....newbie here...I have been off and on SR now for over a month trying to learn everything I can and have finally got everything down( not slow or stupid, just got a busy life) except how to purchase and transfer BTC into my SR account....I have read many many forums on it, though many seem old and outdated as many of the ways are shot down by the more experienced. I made it through the PGP process and saved the money I need to get started, so this is the last step before Im set for my trip down SR. Please somebody help me with step by step instructions....thank you so much..........................

				You left out some key components to answer your question correctly.&nbsp; Where are you located?&nbsp; How many BTC do you need? Do you want to do this WITH or WITHOUT ID?<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;ll assume USA and tell you how I did it.<br /><br />Created instawallet at blockchain.info.&nbsp; Created account at bitme.com.&nbsp; Made a cash deposit at a local chase bank.&nbsp; Went home, sent in copy of receipt.&nbsp; Had money in account within 10 minutes.&nbsp; Bitme is kind of an exchange, so I exchanged my money in the account for BTC.&nbsp; Then sent the BTC to my blockchain.info wallet address.&nbsp; Then to SR.&nbsp; All in all took less than an hour.&nbsp; Blockchain wallets are fast at confirming transactions.&nbsp; This is how I did it with no ID needed.

				Well I can only tell you what someone I know (who definitely isn&#039;t me) does.<br /><br />Get a Mt.Gox account, make a bank transfer (from your own bank), once the money is in your Mt.Gox account trade it for Bitcoins. Send Bitcoins to an InstaWallet then send from there to your Silk Road wallet as soon as the funds are available.<br />The Mt.Gox account I&#039;m referring to has also been verified, meaning they have been sent proof of identity by the account owner and it matches the name on the bank account being used to send money.<br /><br />This system has been used many times over months without any issues. Personally I think most people are overly paranoid when it comes to Bitcoins. If you&#039;re an average to small time purchaser a lot of the precautions people recommend are unnecessary. It will vary slightly depending on your country so you may want to let us know and people from your country can chime in.

				Bro here is a very very simple easy way..<br />1.go to bitinstant.com<br />2 at bitinstant select the send to adress option, copy your account from SR paste it in on where it should go..finish the rest. Print the receipt and go to somewhere that uses money gram and your done..It has a few payment options on bitinstant.com its very simple..Then you can go to blockchain and watch as you get confirmation that your money is being sent..I do it that way all the time. Im from USA also

				I use instawallet.org.&nbsp; Whether I get btc from an outside source, or from an inhouse vendor, have&#039;em sent to instawallet, handy as hell, then to my SR btc address, the one you see when you click on &#039;account&#039; on main site.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use a Desktop wallet, myself...I use Tails or LiberteLinux so I use an online wallet, like instawallet has...lots of different ways to do this, man, and like so many things on here, kind of got to sort out which suits you best :)

				Why wait? And i will be using like 110 bucks for the first time... seems like a little much but then again the vendor is trusted and good reviews so i hopefully will be safe.<br /><br />also when signing up on bitcoin central should i use real normal email address? since its not going to be connected to my other wallet or sr obviously.

				If your just a user sending to your SR wallet directly is more than fine. SR tumbles and fogs the transaction to a degree. Buying BTC isnt illegal. LE need a full proof investigation of what you purchased with that said amount of money. Simply transfering money to a SR wallet(even if they could prove it was a SR wallet) Proves absolutely nothing.&nbsp; I understand the paranoia coming from a sellers perspective lmao but a small time non violent user is the last thing LE is worried about. Especially if your not using ID lmao send straight to ur SR wallet bouncing the coins back and forth on clear net wallets is only ganna provide a link.<br />

				You sound like you&#039;re second guessing yourself TBH.<br /><br />Dollar bills go from your bank to that bitcentral company or whoever it is. Bitcentral swap the dollars for BITCOINS and store it in a bitcoin wallet on your behalf.<br /><br />These bitcoins are now yours, you can send them to any bitcoin address you come across.<br /><br />I recommend sending the coins onto another wallet where you&#039;ll have more tools at your fingertips - blockchain.info is great.<br /><br />*After you send your coins to your SR wallet you will have to WAIT so dont go nuts and post all over here asking why. It takes time for the SR to tumble your bitcoins.<br /><br />LE&nbsp; &nbsp;=Law Enforcement<br />LEO=Law Enforcement Organisation<br />n00b= People who dont read the countless other threads on this subject. lol jokin buddy.

After careful analysis the funds are swapped for clean or &quot;un-tainted&quot; coins found from either the shared mixing wallet or from blockchain.info&#039;s private wallet.
