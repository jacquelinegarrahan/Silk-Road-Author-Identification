				&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, this is just a little weird/confusing. So it&#039;s been over 24 hours since I placed an order at getbitcoin.com and sent payment from dwolla (to account &quot;admin@get-bitcoin.com&quot; which turned into &quot;GetBitcoin&quot; after entered). There is a 24 hour guarantee, and all I have gotten so far is a confirmation e-mail for my order. Blockexplorer shows no incoming bitcoins. I have e-mailed support in the early morning hours and have not heard back. It doesn&#039;t make sense based on the tons of positive reviews.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A few things that I found odd:<br /><br />-- The site at which I originally made the order was &quot;www.getbitcoin.com&quot;. After googling, I notice that technically the official site is &quot;https://www.get-bitcoin.com&quot;. So I visit this one. Even though I typed in &quot;www.get-bitcoin.com&quot; without the &quot;https://&quot;, when the page loaded up the address bar changed to add the &quot;https://&quot;. This change did not occur with &quot;www.getbitcoin.com&quot;. So, I thought, an imposter site maybe? I compared both sites, and every thing is identical. Even the support/admin e-mails matched. But still, usually when you type in a site only slightly incorrectly, the address changes to the correct one when the page loads. Not only did the first site not add the &quot; - &quot; between &quot;get&quot; &amp; &quot;bitcoin&quot;, but it didn&#039;t add the &quot;https://&quot; either.<br /><br />-- The initial order confirmation e-mail I got was from &quot;support@get-bitcoin.com via sendgrid.info&quot;. I sent my help request e-mail to &quot;support@get-bitcoin.com&quot; (made sure about the &quot; - &quot; so I know this is the real support e-mail). In response to this, I got an automated reply with a confirmation of receipt and a ticket # for the request. This automated reply was from &quot;support@getbitcoin.zendesk.com&quot; (Not only is it not the same host as the initial &quot;via info.grid&quot;, but the &quot; - &quot; was missing here).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know what to make of all these small details. But I&#039;d assume there should be more consistency with names if the business is the real deal right? Even when I typed in the e-mail address correctly (with the &quot; - &quot;, I got a response from an address without a &quot; - &quot;)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What do you guys think of all this? What is the most likely explanation?
