				The only time LE have demonstrated that they traced hidden services, it was the result of applications being hacked. If you root a hidden service, you can get its IP address, unless you root an environment that is isolated away from external IP address, in which case you would need to break out of the isolation.<br /><br />There are numerous ways they could trace hidden services with pure traffic analysis, but so far they have never revealed that they have actually done this.

				Those hidden services were traced after being hacked by the police. Some of them were not traced, because they used isolation that the police could not break out of (pretty sure they were using virtualbox for isolation actually, although of course hardware or paravirtualization or OS virtualization are better as was discussed at length in other threads).<br /><br />Not a failure of Tor in these cases but a failure of the people who ran those sites to keep them fully patched.
