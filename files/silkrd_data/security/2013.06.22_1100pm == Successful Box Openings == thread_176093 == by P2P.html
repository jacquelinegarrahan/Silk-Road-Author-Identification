				I&#039;d like to hear stories, as detailed as possible, of your ventures opening boxes both with or without false identification. The provider, of course, is very important. General procedures, the application process, accepted forms of ID, what they specifically did with your IDs (the most important part), etc.<br /><br />I am very interested to know what a successful process for obtaining a box with false identification looks like. Specifically, what needs to be done to ensure your false identification is passable. As we know, box carriers make copies of the identification, but do they also send the identification and/or ID information to the post office for approval? If so, can this be used to thwart any attempt at opening a box with false identification? For example, if they put your driver&#039;s license number on the application that they send to the USPS - the USPS could simply cross-reference this with the DMV database to see if it was in fact a real identity that was given. Or do they check via the address, to see if it is a real address, and if the name matches the one on the address? Do they do both? Neither? Would an out-of-state fake correct these possible problems? I&#039;d like answers on this to be sure of how to proceed with obtaining a fake box.<br /><br />Mind you I do not purchase illicit goods off of the SR. The box is not for that. I understand and have seen all of the arguments on that side of things. The box is simply to receive anonymous mail that otherwise may cause trouble or incite an investigation into my personal activities, which, as an honest citizen, I do not want.

				Put some hairspray on the photo of your fake ID, you can&#039;t see the difference with your bare eye but a photocopy of such an ID will show a distorted picture, which is good to avoid biometric identification. It&#039;s also advisable to slightly change the distance between your eyes and change the position of you nose a little on the picture for you fake ID.<br /><br />More info : http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/smuggle.html&nbsp; &nbsp;see &quot;General Mail Info&quot;.

				I too am curious to find out much of what the OP asked.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t have much to add, but it would be good to know.&nbsp; Thanks for posting it

It seems relatively untraceable by any USPS database methods, because all packages would be received in the company name. The only question is if the virtual offices register your name in any sort of public (government-accessed) databases that could be retrieved by the USPS. Do you have any info on this?<br /><br />Also, is it necessary to have a registered business in order to be able to purchase a VO?

Maybe a blurry picture of you taken by a security camera won&#039;t work but if you don&#039;t slightly change your face on you fake ID it will be matched with your real ID. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s totally necessary but it&#039;s better to take precautions like that just in case.

				Get a fake id. Travel to a couple of box locations &amp; find the one with the most bored looking employee. Those folks don&#039;t make much per hour &amp; generally don&#039;t give a shit. Obviously living in a metro area helps.
