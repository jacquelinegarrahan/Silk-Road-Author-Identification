				I&#039;ve sent a message to two different sellers multiple times now and every time they try to decrypt it they get this error.<br /><br />&#039;Decrypt failed! (No secret key)<br />Code = 17&#039;<br /><br />I did this this for months with no problems. I took a break for a while and encrypted my message the same way I always have and this started happening. 1- Copy and paste user&#039;s public key to note pad and save 2- Import user&#039;s key to PGP 3- Write message in a new notepad that I wish to encrypt 4- In the task bar find PGP, right click it, click &#039;current window&#039;, and &#039;encrypt&#039; 5- Choose the corresponding user&#039;s key I wish to send the message to and ecrypt it 6- Copy and paste this encryption in the medium I send it to them though and send it<br /><br />The only thing I could think of that might have changed is I messed around with my PGP after I stopped using it and I needed my passphrase, but I&#039;d forgot it because I never had to use it. I thought maybe that had something to do with &quot;no secret key.&quot; I created a new master key with a new passphrase and they both got the same error again! So I started completely over. I uninstalled PGP and erased all my keyrings. I even removed my key from the database online and made a new key from scratch. Same error!!!!!!<br /><br />WTF!?<br />

No ifs, no ands, no buts. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and download GPG4USB, and then to Astor&#039;s tutorial: <br /><br />GPG4USB homepage:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html<br /><br />Astor&#039;s GPG4USB Tutorial:&nbsp; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />It&#039;s easy enough to confirm what you&#039;ve been doing -- just send me a message with the following: <br /><br />1) Both of the vendor&#039;s public keys<br /><br />2) Your PGP public key. <br /><br />3) An arbitrary text message encrypted to their vendor&#039;s keys the same way you&#039;ve described above. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I won&#039;t be able to decrypt the message, but I will be able to determine which keys it is encrypted to. <br /><br />NC<br />

				Could the failure message have actually said &#039;No public key&#039;? That would mean you &#039;signed&#039; your message and the vendor has not imported your public key.<br /><br />Best to not sign messages for our purposes here on the SR. I think 100% of my customer&#039;s PGP issues have been resolved by asking them to re-encrypt without signing.
