				Yeah, more detail would help... Did you order &quot;large&quot; quantities of good, or were they small personal shipments. <br /><br /><br />For most of us on SR, the only reason I could see them coming after a small time buyer is to get more information on the seller.

				Major interception as being a very large order or just &quot;something&quot; was intercepted?<br /><br />I used a wire transfer once, but I bought a book with my BTC. After that it&#039;s all been cash deposits into the bank with no trail.<br /><br />

				<br />Can definitely not say anything for sure, but if I had to guess I would say it isn&#039;t related to the vendor but to the method of getting BTC.&nbsp; Wire transfers led to them flagging mail coming in to that address.&nbsp; If anything knowing the way BTC were acquired may help prevent this in the future.&nbsp; I&#039;d also hope the vendor knows as that return address may be flagged now as well.<br /><br />Until more comes out, all we can do is speculate...<br />[/quote]<br /><br />If what your speculating happened I see him getting off,&nbsp; Because that sure as hell doesn&#039;t constitute a search.&nbsp; What he did was legal, and in no way was that a legal search and seizure.&nbsp; Unless he was dumb enough to let them in without a warrant which I doubt.&nbsp; Last time I checked it wasn&#039;t illegal to get bit coins through wire transfer.&nbsp;

				Hello,<br />Marsvolta is a well known member on the forum, for me he says the truth is this post, no reason to tell bullshit. <br />I remember that a few months ago he had an order, something like 20 g of molly sent at 2 different addresses, that he never received. His conclusion was that Dr Amsterdam was a &quot;selective scammer&quot;... So I guess he may have use this addresses again because he never envisaged his orders were seized. <br /><br />WL

				IMO, if they intercepted 20g of MDMA from the Netherlands, found supporting evidence in the form of wire transfers, and STILL couldn&#039;t make the felony &quot;drugs in the mail&quot; charges stick, then I&#039;m feeling pretty good right now. Of course, there is much speculation involved here, but I wanted to provide an alternate take on things.<br /><br />Number one, I don&#039;t order from the Netherlands. Jesus fucking christ people, seriously. Are you that hard up you can&#039;t deal with somebody in the US or Canada? Of all the risky behavior that happens on here, it all pales in comparison to ordering from NL. If I were to look at &quot;What behaviors provide the maximum increase in my chance of getting busted&quot;, I think ordering from the NL is even more dangerous than say, not encrypting your address when you purchase. Seriously, just check the &quot;Domestic Only&quot; box, &quot;fan&quot; your favorite Canadian vendors, and never look at shit from Europe again. It will dramatically reduce your risk profile.<br /><br />Number two, I&#039;ll never be ordering 20 grams of any powder ever, that&#039;s clearly far beyond personal use, and there is a huge stigma attached to hard drugs that increases the desire to prosecute.<br /><br />Number three, even with more evidence than they would have had with me, they couldn&#039;t make the charges stick. Simple possession sucks, no doubt, but it&#039;s not going to result in Pound Me In The Ass Prison.<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to risk being charged with simple possession. Hell, I risk that every time I leave the house with something in my pocket.

				Whether true or not, these threads (sometimes) get some good speculation and discussions going. Stuff like this isn&#039;t really any reason to be paranoid (re: &quot;Not enough evidence found to prosecute&quot;). Especially since the OP was American, this is great news for all my neighbours south of the border. I have a stigma in my mind attached to US enforcement, namely the DEA. In Canada, cross-jurisdictional affairs are dealt with by the RCMP who by no means have any amount of expenditures close to the DEA in the US (per capita of course).<br /><br />As I said, we do need these discussions to speculate prevention tactics and other precautions to take while on the Road. What rids my mind of paranoia is the fact that I order domestic, and that I feel much sketchier going somewhere physical to buy something (even if it&#039;s a friend in some cases). Little chance for plausible deniability when u walk out of a dealers house with a bag of drugs!<br /><br />Happy driving everyone!

				I posted this in another thread, but I&#039;m copying it here because I think it&#039;s relevant and these points are often overlooked.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, cops can sell drugs.<br /><br />Yes, federal agents can &quot;walk&quot; guns into Mexico.<br /><br />What I haven&#039;t seen mentioned is securing the chain of evidence.&nbsp; The fact that federal agents walked guns into Mexico became an issue when those guns were LOST, and then an agent was killed by one of the same guns.<br /><br />When cops sell drugs, those drugs, and the recipient, can be followed, tracked, monitored, whatever you want to call it, in order to obtain MORE EVIDENCE.&nbsp; Otherwise, an arrest is made on the spot, and then the cops turn the screws to get that person to roll, cooperate, and inform.<br /><br />Arbitrarily selling and mailing high potency drugs to random people by LE serves no purpose whatsoever, and at the same time endangers public safety.&nbsp; Once those drugs are mailed, there is no admissible evidence whatsoever unless it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that said drugs were indeed received, and furthermore, actually ordered, by the recipient- and this cannot happen unless the chain of evidence remains intact from the time the drugs are mailed to the time the drugs are received- hence the concept of a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;.<br /><br />Now, using operation &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; as an example, what kind of shit storm would be created if LE purchased, and subsequently resold, a generous amount high quality Afghani #4, which then caused the deaths of a 12 year old kid and two of his friends who happened to pick that particular package out of their neighbors mailbox during a random act of mischief?<br /><br />No secure chain of evidence.&nbsp; No reasonable attempt to ensure public safety.&nbsp; No extra-departmental cooperation.&nbsp; Only the DEATHS of a couple of kids to show for their efforts.&nbsp; Such a scandal would eclipse operation Fast and Furious by several orders of magnitude.<br /><br />Yes, LE can break the law in their attempts to &quot;enforce&quot; the law.&nbsp; But they have to tread very, very carefully in order to be able to actually USE THAT EVIDENCE to secure a conviction in a court of law.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suppose LE could use informants in place of actual officers, but this is still a pretty risky proposition.&nbsp; Additionally, with the current amount of orders being placed daily on SR, there would need to be cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement on a scale never seen before to make such tactics worthwhile.<br /><br />What happens if a federal agent (or informant) sells to a local cop (or informant) trying to make a name for himself?<br /><br />What happens if a disgruntled SR member decides to order a nice package of dope from a LE vendor, and has it sent to a cop/prosecutor/judge out of spite?<br /><br />What happens when a federal agent sells to a young teen who happened to make their way here, and the teen ends up dying?<br /><br />Who is really who they claim to be when placing an order on the Road in the first place?<br /><br />If LE attempted to actually snare buyers on SR, it could easily turn out to be a clusterfuck of monumental proportions.&nbsp; Aditionally, it would need to be done on a MASSIVE scale to be the least bit effective- a buyer snagged here and there will eventually lead to one of those buyers posting his tale of woe on the forums.&nbsp; I sure as hell would.&nbsp; And I&#039;d fucking post details, even if I had to use a dummy account on a different computer.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t that I think &quot;cops&quot; are too virtuous to employ these methods- I just don&#039;t see these methods being an effective way to disrupt Silk Road, and I have seen no solid evidence to the contrary.

Many many thousands.<br /><br />That&#039;s corruption in action.&nbsp; Some people are protected by nature of their position.&nbsp; Others will get screwed for speaking up.<br /><br />Anyone that&#039;s dealt with the U.S. court system knows its incredibly corrupt.&nbsp; It&#039;s better than a 3rd world country, but it&#039;s still corrupt as all hell.&nbsp; The police, the judges, and prosecutors (often even defense attorneys) are all routinely friends, and know each other .&nbsp; You can often overhear their familiar chit-chat in the minutes before a trial, talking about watching the football game together etc.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Judges aren&#039;t buddy-buddy with cops, many judges feel it&#039;s their personal responsibility to balance out the agents/cops/detectives and call them on their bullshit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Obviously you&#039;ve never been arrested, charged, or gone to court .&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly how it is .&nbsp; Judge often are friends or acquaintances with police.<br /><br />Sometimes you will get a non-corrupt judge who takes his responsibility seriously, and tries to take the side of the public rather than the State.&nbsp; But even if you get a good non-corrupt judge,&nbsp; if the case is important enough,&nbsp; the powerful &#039;forces of coincidence&#039; aka the local authorities will ensure the case gets reassigned to one of their corrupt buddies.<br /><br />Example:&nbsp; At Occupy New York, the night they were evicted in the middle of darkness , outside the view of the media,&nbsp; the protestors got an emergency injunction at 7am saying that the cops were wrong for evicting them (1st amendment grounds), and that they could return to the park.&nbsp; &nbsp;The judge wrote a ruling saying that she had to side with free speech, and that the protesters should be allowed to return to the park immediately , pending further litigation.&nbsp; This was a binding emergency injunction, carrying the force of law and the State -- supposedly.<br /><br />The protestors brought copies of the injunction / court ruling to the police chief, to mayor Bloomberg, and even brought printouts street cops. The cops ignored printouts of the injunction that protestors were waving, Mayor Bloomberg ignored the court injuction, and even ordered the NYC police chief to ignore the (legally binding) court injunction until Bloomberg got the case heard by one of his preferred judges.<br /><br />Later that day, at around 2pm, the protestors case was reassigned to a judge affiliated with the mayors office ( the judge was a buddy of Bloomberg&#039;s, just a coincidence), and this new corrupt judge (reassigned to the case)&nbsp; , reversed the earlier preliminary injunction from earlier that morning issued by the non-corrupt judge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus the protesters would not allowed back into Zucotti park.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But the rules have changed.

				Coming down on the details of someones account on the forums is only the slightly nervous strengthening their backbones. If the details are correct, it is fine to assume the OP took unnecessary risks, and I will be glad if he comes through it allright.

				common sense goes along way in this enviroment, but its also easy to get blinded by the light (so to speak) and get complacent.<br />keeping a clean house is logical, or at least clean as you can keep it.<br />sure some dont have the means to keep their stash at a different location, unless you&#039;d keep it at a family or friends resident which IMO is shady.<br />no need to brings others into the mix...<br />and dont think just cause it isnt in your house but somewhere on your property that a warrent doesnt cover it.<br />

				I&#039;m a little more relaxed now (if you catch my meaning) a little wine and weed and other ::) But I really think its horrible where we have to fear our doors getting kicked in and pets shot and house trashed, for minor bullshit that doesn&#039;t compare to the corporate corruption that is going to limit our children and there children of a decent life in the police state called Amerika!......If you get a chance? check out Chris Hedges and the lawsuit him and other important people have against the patriot act. Its the most important piece of law to come out in the last 40 years+. Were talking Woman&#039;s rights issues in 2012? one step forward two steps back! I know its an uphill battle for Occupy but &quot;springs in the air&quot; And with global warming! should have a long summer stirring the shit up like it needs.....more power too them! I would like to see an Occupy Party. Then they can state what there all about. but seriously, Its all I got to hold on too. I don&#039;t look forward to getting arrested and getting a strip search for a minor arrest or even traffic stop.......perverts.......Nazi&#039;s, corporate control freaks! The Koke Brothers own our Congress which is at a 10% rating! wow! a whole 10% of people approve of there legislators and yet with cleaver redistricting they never get voted out. There&#039;s a fire sale going on in America. and the workers will be just an afterthought&nbsp;

				Most likely scenario this and that. <br />Also note that OP is into meth, as well. And has dealt with the now infamous VMM, who has mass orders not arriving, asking for addresses again, and so on and so forth. <br />OP posted in a frantic manner that puts the whole community on edge. Being a commoner to the forums, OP should have known to provide a bit more info, not have everyone seeking PM&#039;s. What&#039;s the difference? If someone is gonna see it, they gonna see it here, or in the PM. <br />MarsVolta should have said WHY they did,at the least. <br />How is everyone coming to the 20g of MDMA conclusion? I&#039;m confused. <br />If a vendor has been popped, or outed, and is now possibly working with, or is LEA&#039;s, then I feel we should be in the know. <br />In fact, if anything happens to me, my brother, who has nothing to do with SR, and lives in another state, has all my account info, and will be here to tell the whole story, should anything ever happen to me via SR. <br />Not telling us about a possible bad vending situation is the same as being a fucking snitch in my book.

				I&#039;m thinking that the &quot;wire transfers&quot; were just made up bullshit by the police.&nbsp; They could have just busted in with some random pieces of paper and stated waving them around.&nbsp; Like say if it was the 20g or whatever from the Netherlands, they could have intercepted it and since it was a huge amount, they made up the wire transfers as a way to make the OP crack when really they had no idea how he paid for it.&nbsp; Just a thought but I&#039;m thinking as long as packages keep showing up with the contents inside, it should be ok, sort of?&nbsp; Oh yea, and don&#039;t order from the Netherlands if you in the USA...especially 20 grams of fucking MDMA.&nbsp;

				I know you can&#039;t just click on a link here, but basically it say that 31 members and associates of the Hells Angels who had been&nbsp; arrested on drug charges in a massive dragnet 3 years ago have had their cases thrown out of court because of unreasonable delays before trial. This was a police investigation that had taken 17 years to complete. Hells Angels are very powerful in Canada. There were 156 accused, some of murder, drug trafficking, conspiracy etc. The cops used wiretaps and video surveillance. Twenty two hundred witnesses have been called. Truthfully this makes me feel very small and unworthy as far as having a few thing posted to my mailbox. I can&#039;t call myself better or worse than the people arrested. I don&#039;t know them, but it seems many on here seem to think that the same amount of resources are going to be used against each and every one of us. There are always going to be a few street busts with pics of drugs and guns to appease the press, but I think most of us are small potatoes compared to what is really going on in the world of drugs. Try to keep your house and comp clean and probably most of us will be fine.

				Hi,<br /><br />that is the reason as vendor i filter and change my operation methods with every shipment because i know LEO is watching all the time and collecting data about SR Customers and Vendors.<br /><br /><br />Shipment Method:<br /><br />I use for every new shipment a new business letter for safety and security reasons.<br />I use difference business letters for new customers and regular customers.<br /><br />Sometime I wait on purpose 1-2 days with sending the package because of the safety reasons.<br />I try to send the letters from difference cities also to keep my shipment operation secret, safe and discreet.

				I think one of the biggest issues here is that people do not understand their rights.<br /><br />Case and point, police officers can not and usually do not do &quot;whatever they want&quot;.&nbsp; If they do not have a warrant they cannot come in your house and if they do, unless you have an online rent-a-lawyer, they will get all of the evidence and the charges tossed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also people here have a terrible understanding of what entrapment is.&nbsp; An example of entrapment that would never ever hold up in court would be an LE officer posing as a vendor and selling drugs, which is why they absolutely aren&#039;t doing it.<br /><br />Know your rights, if you know them you will most likely be completely safe on SR using basic precautions like PGP.

				<br /><br />Federal agents busted in.<br /><br />waved wire transfers in my face<br /><br />Asked if i ordered anything from the internet.<br /><br />Arrested me on another drug they found<br /><br />One thing is for certain.... There are eyes somewhere searching for something.<br />Like where ever you are at and the technique that you used is suspect.<br />also if they were (asking) this could also mean that they are not sure if you did order something or not.<br />Its not illegal to order something from the internet although what you are ordering and who you are ordering from may be.<br />basically you should fall back and find a new approach.....

				Mercury, perhaps he&#039;s just letting us all know the basics of the situation so we take a little more care in our business? I don&#039;t see any problems with him describing what has happened if only it inspires fear. Sometimes we all need to take a step back and make sure we&#039;re not being reckless.

				we cannot state specific details in respect to my old partner. if LE is monitoring these forums, then they can link the crime to my old partner. therefore, i will not post any specifics about the bust. i can specify that it was only one of us, and my old partner is no longer involved in this account. i am in the process of getting a new partner, and this is the last i will post in regards to this topic. thank you all for your support

For that matter, why do all your partners need to use this one account? You are not making any sense.<br />Marsvolta12&#039;s account seems to be the focal point of your interest and maybe the pm&#039;s that were stored in it.<br />Try not to get too emotional here.
