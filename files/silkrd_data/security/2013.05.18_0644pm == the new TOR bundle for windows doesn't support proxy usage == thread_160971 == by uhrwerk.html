				What do you mean by missing proxy settings?&nbsp; Onion icon -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network<br /><br />I see the same proxy settings that have always been there. Nobody is getting paid to develop Vidalia, so it is extremely unlikely anything will change about it... until they remove it completely and integrate its features into TorBrowser<br />

				I can confirm that the latest version of Tor for Windows *does* have proxy (SOCKS v4a and v5) support and the proxy *is* working for me.

				I agree the setting is there but it does open more connection than the ones one the proxy to tor.<br />I have not checked the ips, but if you see for yourself in the command line (start - run - &quot;cmd&quot; ) If you enter the command &quot;netstat -an&quot; it does show more connections than the ones going through the proxy for me. That has not been the case with version 2.3.25.6, only with 2.3.25.8. I also get a lot of errors trying to get the proxy&nbsp; setting to work. I think there is something wrong with version 2.3.25.8, or it is, to me. I am running it on windows XP.

				Are you sure those connections belong to Tor?&nbsp; netstat -an doesn&#039;t show you that info. netstat -ano will show the process IDs, but then you have to find them in the list of running processes, so you might try something like TCPView. Also, have you confirmed that the outbound connections are going to Tor relays?<br /><br />It&#039;s puzzling, because the Tor that&#039;s included in TBB hasn&#039;t changed since December, so it shouldn&#039;t have magically stopped working. Maybe Vidalia isn&#039;t writing the Tor options to torrc correctly? You could manually add them by shutting down TBB, opening torrc with a text editor adding either,<br /><br />for Socks5 proxy: Socks5Proxy &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;<br /><br />for HTTP proxy: HTTPProxy &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;<br /><br />Maybe Vidalia isn&#039;t forcing Tor to reload its configuration file, so try simply restarting it first.<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re not trying to run Tor over Tor are you? That&#039;s bad when connecting to clearnet sites, because your entry and exit node could be the same relay.<br />
