				I imagine the BTC&nbsp; price ias very heavily attached to SR (as much as libs will protest otherwise) and SR is growing and growing and keeps getting more publicity so i can imagine it only climbing further. I can see SR and BTC becoming a full movement (maybe)<br /><br />Ben

				If your buying from Vendors who fix price to $US then who really cares about the upward trend of BitCoin ?<br /><br />Or am i missing something&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Though more of a concern i guess if your trading/vending in coin.

				i dont fully understand the BTC <br />i thought that vendors can hedge the price of goods to the BTC,so when the rate rises the prices for goods are adjusted automatically to compensate the rise and fall of the BTC rate,,,,,,am i correct ?? if not then im now worried about the rise aswell,,once it gets too high peeps simply wont use the site anymore,there has to come a point when its just too expensive to shop on SR no matter how good the quality and service

				a little SR history. the reason hedgeing came about was because btc would change, at one point, every min. it went from 5 6 bucks all the way to 30 in a matter of days. sometimes you would see it drop right after a purchase or go up. you never knew what was going to happen. then hacks started happening someone stole massive amount of coin that rose the price. then sold them and price bottomed out. like 1 or 2 a coin. ever since then they have tried to fix the coin. so no i do not believe @ 7.2 whatever is right is not high. you guys have had it good. you already have securities we never had. you have protection we never had. thats why SR charges the fees. try not to complain so much. we have had worse. its all in the archives. its all on here.
