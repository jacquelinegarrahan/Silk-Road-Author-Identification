				I have several reasons to believe that SR is now owned by the DEA. The check is best performed from an alternate user account, and then from there going to your home page. If you login as yourself and go to your home page it may be swapped automatically so that you see nothing wrong. Please login as someone else and check the public pgp key on your home page. You may be the victim of a man in the middle attack if SR is now owned by law enforcement. Neither you or your clients would know there&#039;s anything wrong, as they would allow transactions to be made so as to collect info on the biggest buyers/vendors etc.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just paranoid, but very strange things are happening, almost on queue...

Maybe you didn&#039;t understand what I meant. You&#039;re a vendor here. If LE can hijack pages and change the public key that is displayed there, how would you know? Do you periodically check the first few bytes of what&#039;s displayed there to verify? This is what LE would have to do if they can change the public key on a vendor&#039;s page.<br /><br />1. Save vendor X&#039;s public key.<br />2. Create a new public/private key pair and make sure that all the relevant info such as email addy matches<br />3. Put their public key on the vendor&#039;s page.<br />4. Intercept the buy orders to the vendors which are now encrypted with the DEA&#039;s public key<br />5 Since it&#039;s their public key, decrypt the message and re-encrypt using the vendor&#039;s public key.<br />6. Pass that message on to the vendor.<br />7. The vendor would never know about the man in the middle attack.<br /><br />Additionally buyers typically place their public key in the buy message. The DEA could easily replace that one with theirs and then do a reverse man in the mddle attack so that when the vendor wants to send an encrypted communication to the buyer the vendor would encrypt using the spoofed buyers public key.<br /><br />Again, if the DEA controls the platform they could intercept messages and change public keys on vendors pages, and inside buyers messages. Neither vendor nor buyer would know this is going on, unless the vendor periodically checks their page thru a buyer account.<br /><br />If the DEA doesn&#039;t control the platform then they wouldnt be able to hijack pages and do any of that stuff. Just don&#039;t think that PGP will protect you if the platform has been ownd.<br /><br />Think about it.

Naively buyers will encrypt a message against the public key that&#039;s displayed on a vendors page. There is no guarantee that the key on the vendors page is the one from the vendor unless the vendor checks periodically thru a separate account.<br /><br />Since they&#039;d have the original public key form the vendor&#039;s page, the DEA would then re-encrypt the message that they just decrypted and send it along to the vendor. The vendor would never know about any of this.<br /><br /><br />Additionally once the buyers message is decrypted by the DEA they could simply replace the buyers public PGP key that&#039;s inside their message, and if the vendor wants to send a message to the buyers they&#039;d use that spoofed public&nbsp; key. So a man in the middle attack would occur in both directions.<br /><br />Got it?

The site went down as soon as I exposed that, so that the DEA could swap all the vendors pages back so we&#039;d all think that nothing is wrong! Then you logged in and saw that all was good. Check at a different time and use a different user account! The one you just used has been flagged, since it was a first time use followed by just going to your home page!<br /><br />Vendors must check the public pgp key displayed on their page at random times. Call me crazy chicken shit, I don&#039;t care, this all makes sense. If it hasn&#039;t happened yet, this is what will happen. Mark my words

				An interesting idea for an attack and I would imagine successful. I would think that if the DEA had ownership of the site they would simply shut it down. However should I be wrong, than an easy way to combat this type of attack is register ones key at any of the pgp key registries. Users would pull the key (based of a torrified email address) and use that rather than what is posted on SR. <br /><br />I highly doubt vendors would go through the trouble though.

Unfortunately for the vendors if the DEA did the man-in-the-middle attack right (MITM) the vendor&#039;s private key would always work in decrypting all buys, since the message would then be re-encrypted automatically to the vendor&#039;s correct public key. (After being decrypted and stored) .<br /><br />Just remember that just because I&#039;m paranoid doesn&#039;t mean they are not out to get YOU. I&#039;m not a vendor but I hope that in the vendor e-pamphlet that all you vendors got it tells you to periodically check at random time the integrity of the public key on your page.<br /><br />

This is what they do with CP sites, let peds go about their business, until enough info is collected.<br /><br /><br />Also the problem with key registries is that they are centralized and are subject to infiltration by LEA. They could simply change any public keys stored in any central place should they identify any of them as being the ones from SR vendor pages. Who the hell periodically checks that?<br /><br /><br /><br />Folks just be careful okay?

				onesickpuppy,<br /><br />I understand what you are getting at, and yes it is possible the way you have described it, but it would only really be possible if some automatic system was implemented by a skilled web-programmer. They would have to incorporate a system that automatically decrypts the addresses, saves the data, then automatically reencrypt it to the vendors corresponding public key. They would have to make it do this automatically. This would be incredibly difficult/challenging for a person to code as it would have to pair up the information in thousands of fake DEA keys to the thousands of vendor keys, and update them on a regular basis....<br /><br />So while this IS possible in an extreme circumstance, it is incredibly unlikely and could be found out/detected simply by checking on an alternate buyer account. Even if they just did one vendor at a time, it would still be a somewhat difficult code to implement, and not worth their time in the first place.<br /><br />If they wanted to bust buyers and they already had possession of the site... they would just lock vendor/s out of their accounts and intercept purchases.... and then tell buyers their pgp key doesn&#039;t work. Etc. Just an example. There are much easier ways for them to bust people if they took control of the site.

Buyers will be encrypting messages against the key placed on a vendor&#039;s page. If this is not happening now, then if the DEA EVER owns this, this is what they&#039;ll do. Got it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Onesickpuppy, what you are describing is a classic man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.&nbsp; MITM attacks are the reason that the concept of the PGP Web of Trust was developed, to prevent MITM attacks such as you have described. That is the reason that out-of-band confirmation of PGP Key-ID/Fingerprint is so often&nbsp; recommended. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the problem is that the Web of Trust was originally designed to be applied to non-anonymous real-world identities, where the parties could confirm the key information by alternate means &quot;out of band&quot; means (e.g. in-person, phone, fax, etc.)&nbsp; This becomes problematic when one is dealing with anonymous entities, such as those doing business here on Silk Road. <br /><br />That said, I suspect that a DEA takeover is a worst-case scenario, and rather unlikely. I believe that if the DEA were able to compromise SR, they would do so in the least-intrusive manner possible, operating it so as to arouse the least suspicion, and thus maximizing their haul from their data mining operations, prior to shutting SR down in the most public way possible. <br /><br />What I believe to be far more likely would be the bust of one or more large vendors, with law enforcement taking over their accounts and using these to snare some of their larger customers. Even the DEA doesn&#039;t have the resources to go after everyone -- there are only so many hours in the day, there are only so many boots that can be put on the ground. Like everyone else, they want the maximum bang for their buck. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MIT clearnet keryserver<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br />

				kmfkewm,<br /><br />I have about 20+ years experience in programming in about 9 different languages; but yes you are right, looking back at my post I can see a couple of my statements were severely short-sighted. I should probably avoid responding to these sorts of posts while I am sleepy, haha. I guess part of my shortsightedness came from the extremely obvious paranoid tone of OP&#039;s post that caused me to automatically dismiss it. It&#039;s just the DEA has rarely been known to employ all of the technology at their disposal, or they could readily catch every vendor in a few months time, if they wanted to... the fact that they haven&#039;t done THAT yet makes OP&#039;s proposed scenario practically laughable. It&#039;s hilarious really, people themselves constantly post methods on the forums, publicly, in which DEA could use to catch them very easily, and they do it out of paranoia of not getting caught! HA. I won&#039;t post any obvious methods that I have read in the past before, for obvious reasons, but if you have been around you know the exact sort of stuff I am talking about as you&#039;ve likely read it yourself.<br /><br />Besides, don&#039;t you think the DEA is more concerned with catching vendors, than the thousands of small-time buyers and the occasional/frequent bulk buyers. Yeah there&#039;s a lot of big buyers here on SR, but I don&#039;t think many of them are hitting 6 digits transactions. Sure they could use this to catch people buying small-pounds of weed/coke/etc but it wouldn&#039;t really be worth the effort. Soon after so many busts people would realize something was up and many would stop vending....thus they[DEA] loses their chance at busting many of the vendors.<br /><br />-Miss

I would think that if the DEA had ownership of the site they would simply shut it down. However should I be wrong, than an easy way to combat this type of attack is register ones key at any of the pgp key registries. Users would pull the key (based of a torrified email address) and use that rather than what is posted on SR. <br /><br />I highly doubt vendors would go through the trouble though. Would be nice though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think they would shut it down immediately. They would collect as many addresses and communications as possible, sort them by highest purchase and then in one fell swoop, go after the biggest purchasers, and then shut SR down all in parallel in a shock and awe maneuver. This is what they do with CP sites, let peds go about their business, until enough info is collected. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep.

Remember not all the keyservers are in the U.S. Tampering with this would be risky... eventually SOMEONE would notice, and the jig would be up.&nbsp; FWIW, I check my keys periodically, to make sure they haven&#039;t changed on the keyserver. (I have, on occasion, noticed dubious signatures have been added to some of my keys, but that&#039;s the extent of the changes that I have ever observed take place, and that&#039;s over the course of a decade..)<br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MIT clearnet keryserver<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				The only problem with sorting out all the listings by the people who purchase the most expensive things would be that most people working with very large quantities are smart enough not to store all their gear in the place where the receive it, let alone do business there, though there are some pretty unsafe people out there.
