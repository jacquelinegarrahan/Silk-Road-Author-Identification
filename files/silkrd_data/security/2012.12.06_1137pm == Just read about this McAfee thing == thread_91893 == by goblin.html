				OK, I know a lot of you probably know about this more than I do, but when I heard this I just had to post it up. Apparently this McAfee guy, the founder of McAfee security, was on the run because of some crime he allegedly committed (murder?) and he continued blogging and even posted online somewhere a pic of himself with some guy who supported him. He was really rubbing it in that he was invulnerable, really showing a lot arrogance and hubris, and that was his undoing.<br /><br />It looks like the dunce forgot to scrub the metadata off the picture, and it contained a lot of stuff including gps coordinates (like, duh?). It showed the picture was taken in Guatemala, and now the Guatemalan police arrested him, it looks like for just entering the country illegally, but now he&#039;s been transferred to Interpol and he&#039;ll likely be extradited to wherever he was where the crime was committed, I guess the US.<br /><br />Guys, if it can happen to a really smart guy like McAfee, it can happen to anybody. Remember to scrub your images before posting!<br /><br />goblin

				It was vice.com&#039;s press, they leaked the location in EXIF metadata. For a culture/arts magazine they do publish some quite serious investigative journalism, but I guess they just fucked up on this one.<br /><br />On a side note McAfee is smashing a chick 47 years his junior, what a legend!

				He&#039;s also said later that the gps thing was on purpose as a decoy.. I donno I&#039;m not following it but I know that country is Belize.

				The report I saw on RT said it was in Guatemala, and yes, that it was a decoy, but if that&#039;s so he really fucked up. After all, if you&#039;re hiding, you have to take responsibility for your own safety.<br /><br />woahmang, you mean he&#039;s screwing a girl much younger? That&#039;s fine by me, but did he really murder someone?
