				OK, a beautiful online model - y&#039;know, dances, strips, etc. is in contact w/me. She lives in Europe. Im in USA. She gives 75% of what the user pays to take her in &quot;Private&quot; and also 75% her Tips to the hosting service pimps who set up the software for her cam-to-cam work. Shes very popular, but working for the Digital pimp is barely-getting-by street. So we&#039;re looking into getting a domain, hosting and putting a link on the site for her to have her own setup.<br /><br />That is, she wants to set up the same credit card and timer software in On Camera Dancing, stripping, etc. which she has person-to-person pay-to-view options for the customer with appropriate price controllers. Y&#039;know, like the big cams.com has, but this way she doesnt have to give her current bosses 75% of what the customer spends.<br /><br />Do u have expertise in this area or know anyone who does? Is there off-the-shelf software? She would host her site and we could have a link that puts the viewer into the program. Any ideas or directions you could point me in? Of course we dont expect people to do this for free.<br /><br />

				I got a lot of friends(girls) In Thailand, that are doing just this to live(Get food++ Without having to sell their body on the street) And i have seen have they do it, i cant say just how, but i can help you somewhat, maybe put you in touch with a friend of mine who is in that kind of work.. It is far from 75%, if i say its a friend of mine, maybe 10% commision fee.. But then i would be glad to get a few % too ;) Just for the time i have to make it all happen.. Because the technical issues i can fix, or my program team could fix.. And they work cheap(from the philipines or china)<br /><br />Send me an pm with a little more info about this project of yours.. And i will consider it.. Just make sure she isnt ripping you of!

				If there was a simple off-the-shelf solution, a lot of models who get popular would go independent. They stick with the main sites and pay their fees because the alternative is complicated and crappy.

				Thanx Astor and Stayok, will update as progress calls for it. I think the Skype for a flat fee is probably going to be more immediately practical, and if successful maybe afford a team of programmers.<br />

				Oic Nothing... Now it comes clear. ;) The hook-nosed Israelites are behind the seduction of the gentile maidens.&nbsp; :o Of course... This is even more vile than young, blonde, blue-eyed females being violated by Negroes. :P Darn it, why didn&#039;t I think of that? And the poisoning of Europe&#039;s wells,&nbsp; 8) and don&#039;t forget the bleeding of gentile children into the making of the big matzo&nbsp; :-[... Jeepers.<br /><br />Golly.

				Astor, u r quite right. This is not sex-slavery. The girl is alone in front of her computer and is in contact w/her customer thru keyboard (typing) or by clicking &quot;cam-to-cam,&quot; they can both see each other and talk with each other. It is a fascinating concept philosophically and morally. It&#039;s digital sex - not always an auto-erotic experience; it serves as attempts to alleviate loneliness for some as well as sexual frustration for some (going auto-erotic at the keyboard). I know for sure there are models who play with dildos in front of cameras who, in real-life, are quite ordinary in their real sex-lives, and as lonely as most. They are not prostitutes in general, as the better looking ones could command the $1,000 an hour fees, and then they wouldnt be sitting in front of a camera for nickels and dimes. This is a 21st century technology bringing the sexes together virtually, digitally through titillation and cooperation between two people physically worlds apart.<br />I find it interesting, but then again, Im creeping up on 70&nbsp; ;D

I&#039;ve known a couple of phone dommes -- one so-so, another extremely well -- and they didn&#039;t have to pay anywhere near that kind of fee to the service they used to attract clients.&nbsp; Though this was in America, which I suppose would make a huge difference.&nbsp; Up to a third of their customers were just lonely and looking for some uninhibited chatting too.<br /><br />I find it almost heart breaking sometimes to think that there are people who are lonely and want some pretty company that badly.&nbsp; Beauty really is it&#039;s own kind of precious commodity, I suppose.

				I think that was in the 900 number days. This is all about instant internet billing that is billed under some innocuous name, so even if the customer&#039;s wife saw it, she wouldnt know. There was a movie made about these two guys - each one stupider than the next, low-class pimps who just fell into this thing, where their brother-in-law or sumpthin was a smart accountant, and once they got rolling, this cam-to-cam business just exploded (a billion for them). They take 75% of the money before it even gets to the girl. I dont know if country matters, as this is internet where the models are next to each other on the URL page, but are each located in different countries.

				Fascinating.&nbsp; So essentially the problem is this: they&#039;re entrenched because they have the word of mouth, the credibility, the software, the hardware, and an already huge collection of girls.&nbsp; Sounds to me like somebody needs to write some goddamn software, invest in a few servers or cloud-style hosts, and drop the cost to the customer by 25% -- keeping 25%, and giving the rest to the models.<br /><br />Customer wins.&nbsp; Entrepreneur wins.&nbsp; Girls win.&nbsp; Evil empire loses.&nbsp; ... Somebody write some software!&nbsp; Quick-quick, before someone else beats you to it!&nbsp; ;D

				The entrenched nature becomes obvious with their advertising. Once u start searching for &#039;girls-on-line&quot; and u see those pop-ups about &#039;girls in ur neighhborhood&#039; that want to reach you, you cant help but run into these online girls.
