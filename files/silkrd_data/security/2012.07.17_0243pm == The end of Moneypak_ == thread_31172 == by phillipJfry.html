				Are there still any MP to BTC vendors out there?&nbsp; I noticed on the back of my moneycard it says: &quot;GREEN DOT TRACKS THE USE OF THIS MONEYPAK.&nbsp; We Provide transaction info and surveillance images to LEO to solve crimes.&quot;<br /><br />Is the age of using moneypak to acquire bitcoins dead?&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you think I would be able to go to a local check cashing place and use the moneypak I already bought to pay for a bitinstant moneygram transfer?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />one last question:<br />I tryed a moneygram transfer that &quot;timed out&quot; the lady at the counter said.&nbsp; Could this have been because I used a address that was not real?&nbsp; Do I need to put a REAL address but not my address down on the moneygram form for the transaction to go through?&nbsp; <br /><br />Any help is appreciated.

				Yes there are MP vendors.&nbsp; SugarMama, Pakupaku, BTC Buddy etc.<br /><br />The message on the back of the card is to determine who &quot;scammed&quot; you ie you try to use you MP and the number was stolen by someone at the store then used it them selves or how ever. <br /><br />I doubt you could use a MP to place a moneygram <br /><br />

				I&#039;ll recommend BTCmaster -- http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7bdda04d8b<br />I&#039;ve done many a MP to BTC transactions with him at market value without fees. Also, I&#039;ve yet to hear a bad word about him from anyone.<br />Send him a PM saying something like &quot;I have a $X MP and am looking to get some bitcoins, how many can I get?&quot;<br />Once he responds, if you&#039;re happy with the offer, order his listing and do all the rest... and they should be in your account within the hour.<br />I always PM him first so I know that he&#039;s online; the most I&#039;ve waited for BTC from him has been like 15 mins.<br />

				ok, moneypak is not done.&nbsp; It just seems like Greendot, who is the company that runs moneypak, cooperates with the feds.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have recently tried a Bitinstant bank transfer to coinapult to email transfer.&nbsp; After I got over the fact I had to walk into a bank to do the transfer everything went smoothly.&nbsp; They do NOT check ID and everything was done in about three minutes.&nbsp; WAYYY easier than moneypak and you dont have to blindly trust someone else with your money.
