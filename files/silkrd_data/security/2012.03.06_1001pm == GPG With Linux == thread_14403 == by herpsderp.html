				Hey all <br /><br />are there any linux users out there? im guessing there has to be some with tails and all but i was wondering if there were any more seasoned veterans with linux specifically ubuntu<br /><br />I am currently trying to encrypt a message with GPG PGP GnuPG what have you but cant seem to figure out where to write messages and encrypt them to the corresponding key, It was easy as cake on windows but transferring over to linux and using these past 2 weeks ive been just getting my footing with the terminal<br /><br />is there any user friendly linux programs to encrypt and decrypt messages without the use of the terminal??? all my searches end up as dead ends so need some help thank you!!!<br />

				In ubuntu open software center or manager, search for KGPG...install it. Once its installed, open the terminal and type KGPG (then hit enter). This will launch KGPG which creates and manages your keys...as well as encrypts and decrypts messages too.

				I second KGpg. (I had a hard time installing mine due to weird file system permissions, but looking on Google it seemed to be a really rare problem.) It should be pretty straightforward if you have used GPG before with Windows. Just make sure you export both your public and private keys from your Windows key manager to import into KGpg (and keep that private key safe!).<br /><br />Another option is GPA (Gnu Privacy Assistant), which is what ships by default with Liberte Linux. I think GPA is a little bit lighter weight, but KGpg is probably easier to use and also has a built in text editor.
