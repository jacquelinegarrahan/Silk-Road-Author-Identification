				Hi, I&#039;m asking here as I figure you guys&#039;ll have a better idea than most on how to get this to work.<br />I previously had a windows OS and GPG4Win but have now scrapped windows and installed Linux Ubuntu 12.04<br /><br />I saved all my public/private keys but I&#039;ve had problems setting up GPG on Linux. The only encryption program I could find was the enigmail add-on for thunderbird &amp; I&#039;ve set that up but I&#039;ve got some queries:<br /><br />1: Enigmail only seems to encrypt while sending e-mail, which I don&#039;t want. I want to write a message encrypt it then copy/paste the pgp message to SR (as with gpg4win) but the only way I&#039;ve found is to save the e-mail as draft, encrypt on saving and then go into drafts &amp; copy the pgp message. Surely there&#039;s an easier way to do this?<br /><br />2: Similarly I can&#039;t find how to decrypt a pgp message sent to me on SR?<br /><br />3: I&#039;m uneasy with having my (fake) PGP e-mail and keys associated with my real e-mail setup. Enigmail only lets me encrypt when I create an e-mail draft with my real mail settings otherwise I get the errors <br />&quot;INV_RECP 0 &lt;anonymous@test.co.uk&gt;&quot; and <br />&quot;Unable to save your message as draft.<br />Please verify that your Mail &amp; Newsgroups account settings are correct and try again.&quot;<br />Are there any security risks here? and is there a way to create encrypted messages without any connection to my realworld e-mail settings?<br /><br />4: I tried the S/MIME option but got the message &quot;You need to set up one or more personal certificates before you can use this security feature. Would you like to do so now?&quot; when I click yes I get to a security screen &amp; try to select a certificate. But I get<br />&quot;Certificate Manager can&#039;t locate a valid certificate that can be used to digitally sign your messages.&quot;<br />What sort of file do I need? Not sure if I had thison GPG4Win but I think so and it should be backed up so what am I looking for?<br /><br />Sorry for the long message but I&#039;m just getting to grips with Linux and enigmail and I want to get this sorted out securely but haven&#039;t been able to find clear answers elsewhere online. Hopefully someone here can help me.<br />

				I&#039;ve now managed to find GnuPGShell in the ubuntu software centre&nbsp; which tells me &quot;This program is run from a terminal:<br />wxGnuPGShell&quot;<br /><br />and sure enough it runs with wxGnuPGShell<br />Haven&#039;t tried to encrypt/decrypt with it yet but at least I can get it open now. Any idea how to get it runnable from the desktop, like an icon on the desktop rather than going via the terminal each time?<br /><br />Had a little test of this now, I can encrypt/decrypt&nbsp; stuff with my own key but unlike gpg4win it seems like you can only encrypt something for one other key/recipient rather than multiple recipients &amp; I can&#039;t select myself &amp; another as recipient. <br />Is that the case? <br />Not a big problem it just means I can&#039;t decrypt messages I&#039;ve sent to check the contents, but is there a way to do this I&#039;ve missed? when I tried I got the error&nbsp; &quot;Decryption of file /home/anonymous/Desktop/testing.gpg failure due to errors.&quot;<br /><br />Also it doesn&#039;t seem to give any notification that clicking sign files actually does anything so I&#039;m not sure if it does or not, presume I need to sign before encrypting?
