				All of the above..<br /><br /><br />Could be big business hiring hackers to fuck it up and try to bring it down, or new sites owned now by big business&#039;s to try it soo we go the other way.. At this point iv been testing the waters of BMR always had it on back burner but half the vendor here are there too , it never seems to have any issues, or could just be i dont knw cause i never visit it like i do SR..

				It is entirely possible that it is not an intentional DoS attack but rather is a DoS from the non-malicious clients of SR. Hidden services scale horribly and once you get past 200 or so simultaneous users things really get sketchy in regards to reachability. I don&#039;t know why they have come to the conclusion that it is a DoS attack though. If it is naturally arising from Tor being incapable of coping with such a popular hidden service, one thing they could do is create a second .onion that points to the same thing. Freenode is a popular IRC network that recently had to do this because their original .onion had its introduction nodes DDoSed from all the legitimate users it had. Unfortunately it is really trivial for malicious attackers to make it impossible to reach a .onion though, I will spare the exact details of the attack though. This is really a design problem with Tor, and unfortunately it is not even very high up on the developers list of things to work on. Most of the funding and research going into Tor currently involves bypassing censorship attempts at the ISP level (ie: bridges, obfsproxy), hidden services are somewhat of an after thought, and the primary developer who was still maintaining hidden service code quit working for Tor Project quite a while ago.

				There have been so many similar attacks on Mt.Gox the last weeks, <br />it was probably just a matter of time before (the same?) hackers would turn their attention to SR. <br /><br />Bringing SR down for a few hours/days might have an impact on the value of BTC&#039;s. <br />So (maybe) the security of Mt.Gox is now harder for them to crack down and instead of attacking the trading site to devalue the BTC they try attacking the site where most of the BTC&#039;s are spent..?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure about anything I&#039;m writing above, it&#039;s just a theory...

				I wonder what type of &quot;Tor exploit&quot; this is. The first thing that comes to mind is hammering the intro points. One solution would be to increase the number of intro points. There isn&#039;t a config option for that, so you would have to change the Tor source code and build your own version.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s it, since that would only affect establishing a connection. After that all clients would be routed through rendezvous points distributed across the network, which doesn&#039;t explain the slow loading even after you&#039;re connected. kmf, any ideas?<br /><br />OTOH, is he sure it&#039;s a Tor exploit and not a server exploit, resource exhaustion attack, or something like that?<br />

				I&#039;m just thinking out loud here; I&#039;m not trying to start anything but Atlantis seems to be getting a little more popularity lately. I heard whoever is behind that site is great at programming/configuring/etc. Also, Atlantis uses Litecoin which could give the Atlantis person/people motive to attack Mt.

Gox attacks seem like they were a deliberate attempt to crash the btc temporarily to enable quick buys before the rebound - and what a success story that was for them the second time they tried it. Panic selling as the wave of lag renders (stupidly) high buyers powerless to get out quick enough, and the thing cascades till they suspend the market. But SR? Maybe it&#039;s a gov agency, maybe it&#039;s someone doing it for the lols, but I very much doubt that crippling SR would have much short-term impact on btc. Too many speculators in to matter that much now. Cypress doesn&#039;t give a fuck.

The first thing that comes to mind is hammering the intro points. One solution would be to increase the number of intro points. There isn&#039;t a config option for that, so you would have to change the Tor source code and build your own version.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s it, since that would only affect establishing a connection. After that all clients would be routed through rendezvous points distributed across the network, which doesn&#039;t explain the slow loading even after you&#039;re connected. kmf, any ideas?<br /><br />OTOH, is he sure it&#039;s a Tor exploit and not a server exploit, resource exhaustion attack, or something like that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah wasn&#039;t aware people were connecting but then having slow loading times. It could be DDoS through Tor, if that is the case they would quickly be able to determine it simply by looking at server logs though. That would lead to a slow down as well as unreliability of establishing a connection in the first place.

				I know who is behind these DDos attacks. not the physical person but I know what they&#039;re after.<br />There&#039;s a mass extortion. So far I know of 15 servers that have been brought down by this guy, bitcoinstore was the latest to receive the threat. Making a post about it now

				My fave theory at the moment is that it&#039;s a basement dweller who probably got scammed by someone because they FE&#039;d or with a moneypack and is blaming SR for not being able to sort out their fuckup.&nbsp; Either that or it&#039;s the US testing their new mode of attack. A few years ago I remember reading that they were moving into cyber attacks as a weapon against &quot;hostile&quot; governments. <br /><br />Or it could just be those pesky reptiles that have taken over the world without us knowing.<br /><br />
