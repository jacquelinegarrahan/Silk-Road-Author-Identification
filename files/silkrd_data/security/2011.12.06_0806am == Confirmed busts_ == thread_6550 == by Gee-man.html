				I have been reading through the forums to understand and establish solid protocols for operating on SR.&nbsp; Standards have been set pretty high (as they should be) and the protocols all make sense.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, however, the proof is in the pudding.&nbsp; I am curious if there any / many confirmed arrests or convictions of active sellers or buyers on SR?<br /><br />I hope that the answer is very few.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />G

				There was a strange story posted by acid seller about how he got nabbed in the post office receiving (?) some badly packed weed. I&#039;m not sure if that was true. Also, there was couple reports from buyers that they have been taken in for questioning. One of them spilled the beans and got a fine of something like that. Another said he just denied everything and was fine. Haven&#039;t heard of anything else.

				There were plenty of arrests due to internet drug vending in the last years. Here is an example article of a buyer from some other online vendor (not SR related):<br />http://ibnlive.in.com/news/consignment-of-narcotic-substances-seized/199434-60-121.html <br /><br />Here is an example of an busted seller (also not SR related):<br />http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2007/11/secure-hushmail-can-still-talk-to-the-feds.ars<br /><br />But compared to the volume of internet drug sales the risk is still quite small especially for such small amounts like sold on SR. Also vendors using proper security measurements are usually on the safe site.

				Since SR covers more or less the widest spectrum of jurisdictions (every nation-state, with weighted activity pulsing around the USA + every country that doesn&#039;t grow it&#039;s own THC) ... there&#039;s not a lot of precedence ... I imagine folks who be busted, at least in the US, more or less give up their accounts in exchange for _n_ from their local assistant DA .... if I was an assistant DA and this kind of nonsense landed on my desk ... I would see what I could get quickly from the bustee ... (&quot;how did you order? show me how this works ...&quot;) once I ran into TOR, anonymous browsing and btc and start my tactical approach presenting to a judge who knows NOTHING about any of this, I think my attention would focus on matters more .... local. If you&#039;re not defending / prosecuting WEIGHT, like weight, not just 1lb of weed, but 10lb+ ... there is no case. I dunno if yer criminal def or asst DA, but this rabbit hole is way too deep if you have a case load of shit like &quot;Your honor, I pulled over the defendant whom agreed to a search, upon which I discoved 125lbs of illegal narcotics behind a false wall in the vehicle...&quot; .... you understand my point. <br /><br />A bit of an odd question. Are you calculating your odds? Are you a criminal defense attorney? Or an assistant DA doing research for someone pleading not-guilty to conspiracy to distribute?&nbsp; Wondering what the strategies of defense and / or prosecution is?

				It all depends on the law where you live.&nbsp; Where I live, less than an oz is a misdemeanor, so I never order more than that and if I did order an oz I would ask that it be a little light.<br /><br />Not sure if getting it in the mail changes things, cant find the law on that here.

				...the fact a busted seller is on SR doesn&#039;t mean it has anything to do with it, could be a coincidence -as the postal service etc still work 9-5 doing what they do -arbitrary searches....LE following known leads and intelligence...as i said on other threads a seller may be selling to friends, occasional new buyers whatever gets more product sold....<br /><br />what would you call a SR seller who never leaves their bedroom, like a bedroom Dj.....?<br />

I think that&#039;s a new evolution of distribution. In the past, slinging is a bit of a social endeavor where the size and success of your business is more or less based on your social network (like real social network, not facebook social network) ... and your social network as a dealer is built upon a foundation of good charisma and good drugs ... but all of a sudden, and it is quite sudden, you can have a cabin in the middle of nowhere Tennessee, or 50 miles outside London, or Sydney or Quebec ... and have a thriving business and NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOME or have any face to face interaction with anyone. <br /><br />You can be completely socially awkward, or maybe folks hating buying coke from you because you are psychotically deranged with severe Tourette&#039;s syndrome (&quot;Yeah, I got some good shit, US$60.00 a gram ... FUCK FUCK FUCK POLICE POLICE I&#039;M A COP ARGH FUCK FBI FUCK FUCK&quot;), or maybe you were everyone&#039;s last choice to buy weed from because you&#039;re autistic and a social liability ... an autistic savant growing mind numbingly wonderful weed ... <br /><br />and here we are. welcome to the evolution of distribution for the facebook generation. well, as long as the USPS stays solvent I guess. Without the USPS and it&#039;s foreign equivalents, not sure how well SR works.<br /><br />I guess it would be a social networking site for big distributors meeting mid level street dealers? bundles of cash in trash cans replaced with bundles of _______________ .... I dunno, that seems really risky for a lot of reasons.<br /><br />

				Yeah I&#039;ve been in the online scene for about 3 years. There is a very strong online psych community which is a little older and guys who&#039;ve been around 10+ years. A few months ago several of the vendors got together and went public with their wares (though there were still private ones) and one of the guys on that public board was pinched for a semi-large psychedelic operation. Rumor has it he was sloppy about mail from other countries and had several warnings. <br /><br />There was also another punk type dude who sold IRL and was a bit of a braggart who was pinched for receiving a boat of pills at the US post office. Dumb, huh? A SR vendor would never open up a PO box at the US post service in their own name. <br /><br />The SR is still too new for a bust of this large scale but just wait..... <br />
