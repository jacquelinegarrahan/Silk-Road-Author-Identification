				I plan on making atleast around 3 purchases from this site and at first I wasnt worried about it to much. But I just read some where that silk road is now taken over by the feds. I know it sounds a little crazy but really how am I supposed to know and trust my seller to not be one? Also I hear people saying that you are stupid for using your home address but really what else am I supposed to use?

				Well theres the feedback system to help you find a trusted vendor. If the site was fully compromised this would be a moot point however, but look beyond the words. Look for feedback using varied slang/abbrevs/dialect as spoofed feedback would likely have similar wording on all posts.<br /><br />Also the more you can distance yourself from your own address the better. Use public wifi, or crack some wep if youre tech savvy. If possible deliver to a friend or neighbor and have them bring it to you.&nbsp; <br />I mean its a risky endeavour any way you look at it but unless they can prove beyond reasonable doubt its you, which is expensive and time consuming when cryptography is involved, youll be ok.&nbsp; Keep your orders small and low key items until youre confident.<br />

				Everything you heard is wrong. Also if you&#039;ve been reading these forums then no, you haven&#039;t heard it&#039;s stupid to use your home address. You&#039;ve heard the exact opposite, because the fact that you should absolutely definitely use your REAL name and REAL address is plastered all over the place. Do your research and use some common sense. We&#039;re not gonna spoon feed it to you.
