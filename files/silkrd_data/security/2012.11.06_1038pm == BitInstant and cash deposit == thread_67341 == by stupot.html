				They still take cash deposits , just not through banks.&nbsp; The cash -&gt; bitcoin address option came back today as well - but they now require a valid name / birthday to be entered.&nbsp; Theres a post a few posts down in this forum about that.

				Are you referring to the moneygram?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t like that phone thing.&nbsp; I think I saw someone talking on the forum about how to do it anonymously but I don&#039;t remember what was said.

				The folks at BitInstant told me that the bank deposit option will be back by December 1st, but that is over three weeks away, so I am also interested in learning a simple alternative to that until then.

Just pick &quot;to bitcoin address&quot; in the options then print out the form and head to walmart, then copy the info on the form you printed out to the moneygram bill pay form (it&#039;s colored blue). Use a fake name, address, phone # etc. They dont ask questions because to them your just paying a bill and you dont have to use that stupid red phone. Also the good thing is there is no fee besides the 3.99% Bit instant takes and the 3.95$ zip zap fee. <br /><br />P.S. If the &quot;to bitcoin address&quot; is not available you can always create a mt.gox account and have the coins sent there then send them to ur SR address.

				I just did the bitinstant to mt gox option.&nbsp; Just as easy as to an address.&nbsp; The weird thing though is bitinstant just sent my money to mt gox, where I had to purchase coins.&nbsp; I thought bitinstant sent me coins.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t an issue it just through me off.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used bitinstant yesterday and did not have enter a valid name or DOB, etc.&nbsp; I just do the cvs red phone and give fake info.&nbsp; Easy as long as your local cvs doesn&#039;t require ID.

The less people involved in your transaction the better.
