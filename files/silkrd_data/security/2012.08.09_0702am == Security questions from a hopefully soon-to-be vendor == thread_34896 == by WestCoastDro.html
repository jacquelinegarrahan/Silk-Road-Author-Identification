				Hey all,<br /><br />Found this site a few days and have been reading up on a lot of stuff, especially since I would like to become a vendor.&nbsp; I want to make sure to have all my bases covered as far as security goes BEFORE I start(just computer security for now, will worry about shipping once I am comfortable with the computer side), and was hoping you guys could help with a few questions I have.<br /><br />1. I installed Liberte on a new flash drive, and have been using a laptop I haven&#039;t used in years(won&#039;t be using it for anything else).&nbsp; For signing up to Mt Gox, I don&#039;t really have access to any computers that are unassociated with me, as the guide suggests, so I went to starbucks and used the free wifi, and signed up to MtGox using the &quot;unsafe browser&quot; that is &quot;non-torified&quot;.&nbsp; I also used the &quot;unsafe browser&quot; to sign up for a yahoomail acct which will only be used for signing up to Mt Gox(and getting any necessary email from them).&nbsp; Am I still safe, as long as I only used the unsafe browser at an unassociated wifi location?&nbsp; Is there any way my computer could somehow get tracked, or the email I created with the unsafe browser?&nbsp; I plan to use this laptop for all my SR activity so I wanna make sure it couldn&#039;t have been compromised.<br /><br />2. I created a GPG keypair using the built-in program in Liberte.&nbsp; The guide recommends saving your key to Tormail(I have created a tormail acct already) and deleting it off the USB.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you then have to redownload the file/repaste the keys each time you decrypted a message? Or am I misunderstanding what was said in the guide?&nbsp; If Liberte is encrypted, why would the data saved on the USB(in Liberte) not be safe?&nbsp; What is safe to store on the USB drive(within Liberte, which I am assuming encrypts what get saved)?<br /><br />I am sure I will have more questions, but I would greatly appreciate any help on the ones above, as well as any general tips/advice.&nbsp; From what I have been reading you all seem like a really helpful and friendly community.&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />WestCoastDro
