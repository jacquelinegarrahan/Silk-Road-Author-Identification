				This DDos attack isn&#039;t just to disrupt the SR. This is a massive attack across the internet and it&#039;s intent is to extort money by taking websites hostage. Most websites so far have been on the shadier side of business, recently bitcoinstore has been targeted.<br />Those who do not pay, get taken down. I&#039;ve seen over 15 servers brought down in the last week by this guy and none have come back online.<br />DPR may not even realize he&#039;s being extorted yet. I can only assume his inbox is 100x more packed than mine so he may not have seen the letter, especially with tormail being offline.<br /><br />There is at least 10k worth of rewards posted for information leading to this guys capture..no one cares how or the condition in which he is &#039;captured&#039; in. I&#039;m sure the vendors on here would be willing to add to the reward pot.<br /><br />Some of the extortion letters received:<br /><br /><br />Extort letter:<br /><br />ALEKSANDER BLAGUN (aleksandar.blagun@gmail.com) sent a message using the<br />contact form at https://www.s*****.to/contact.<br /><br />Good afternoon,<br /><br />I have good offer from you. I want to buy your eshop and your clients. I see<br />that you have same products as my company produce. This is &quot;only one&quot; offer<br />which you receive during your life. I know that steroids in your country are<br />not legal you can get serious problems with that ( interpol, police and etc<br />). We are located in Bulgaria, here are steroids still legal. Also you can<br />get in future problems with DDOS attacks. We are cooperate with IT company<br />from London which can do DDOS attacks for us. Your website will fall and be<br />OFFLINE forever ! DDOS protection costs about 1500â‚¬ per month ( a lot of<br />money ).<br /><br />If you do not want sell your eshop, you can sell us your biggest customers. I<br />hope my offer is interesting for you. Let me know, for how much your biggest<br />customers spends money per month on your eshop and how much do you want for<br />these customers.<br /><br />I am serious and discreet your customers will be satisfied, they receive<br />their orders until one week.<br /><br />You should believe my words and cooperate with me because your eshop can be<br />under DDOS attack in few days.<br /><br />This is my fair offer for you.<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Extort letter:<br /><br />paythepiedpiper@tormail.org<br /><br />DDoS will continue on M*****.co until payment is made by LR or bitcoin<br /><br />$2000<br /><br />for $3000 I will stop the DDoS on your site and target a competitor of<br />your choosing.<br /><br />Why you should pay: http://bit.ly/12uVRFL<br />Payment options :-<br />Bitcoin:1E6wygZnwPU2HCx2QwkxFFFd7hPJbrifzp<br />LibertyReserve: U8248232<br /><br />Funding bitcoin guide: http://bit.ly/bitcoinguide<br />Funding LibertyReserve: http://www.libertyreserve.com/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Extort letter:<br /><br />H******.COM was top on e****.com but they didn&#039;t pay so we took them down.

				This caught my interest when i found out SR was under apparently a DOS attack last night. I would contribute a little to this campaign to find out who (person/organization) this is. I have noticed several BTC exchanges suffering from a lot of different attacks. It seems someone is either manipulating the BTC market or just being a full on arsehole.<br /><br />My major issue with attacking SR is not the fact that they are attacking SR but (at least as i understand) the TOR network completely which means a lot of exit nodes are being DoS&#039;d of DDoSd(Correct me if I&#039;m wrong here please as this is of interest to me IT/security wise.). As you all know TOR is a vital tool for a lot of oppressed people and not just somewhere where you can get your drugs easily (it&#039;s a huge plus though!!!). So these actions cannot be tolerated whether by some individual or organization of any sort.<br /><br />DPR and the team know exactly what they are doing otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be risking probably entire lives keeping this thing going. As you should all know technology is turning into an arms race and the public need to be ahead of any government of corporation and we should all try and identify this person and troll the fuck out of him (personally I don&#039;t believe in violence but we could at least try and make his life hell)<br /><br />Peace x<br /><br />

				http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/04/not-anonymous-attack-reveals-bittorrent-users-on-tor-network/ - This should be noted as a security threat. <br /><br />Do not run anything through TOR that may risk your security. I have found some clearnet sites that contain info on how attacks could be made and it seems that it could be pulled off by anyone with a bit of IT knowledge since the attack is known. There was also a guy posting on reddit about how to theoretically take down a .onion site within the last 2 weeks there&#039;s some info in there if you care to have a search (dont have the link sorry).<br /><br />It seems that a strength of not having a browser fingerprint is a weakness when it comes to any .onion under attack due to the way tor works.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents... Hopefully someone will be able to give a bit more info

				I posted in DPRs maintenance thread around page 3,4<br />about something like,&nbsp; &quot;just pay the damn fee they want and just move on. &quot;<br /><br />It was obvious.&nbsp; I knew after DPR last maintenance message a few days ago, he said, &quot;something just doesnt smell right on the back end. &quot;. Site will be Down . . <br /><br />I&nbsp; knew then they were testing the Exploit and checking his reaction to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;He might not want to express so much in his posts.&nbsp; What do I know.&nbsp; I&#039;m just a noob idiot. .&nbsp; .<br /><br />Apparently, there is still some buggy code around the pages that could be exploited in the future, but it will be saved for another day and dollar.&nbsp; Upgrading the servers software is just one housekeeping task that IT guys never get around to finishing.&nbsp; Back burner jobs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />Reward is cool, but it encourages even more attacks I think.&nbsp; &nbsp;Taking the high road and ignoring it is best.&nbsp; Show no reaction. Look like you don&#039;t care and are not affected. They&#039;ll get bored and move on to easier money and targets that are funner to play games with.&nbsp; Offering rewards from drug dealers will create more attacks.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is all open discussion.&nbsp; There is no facts here and I&#039;m just an idiot making posts for random discussion. <br />

Who is to say it&#039;s one guy. <br />And who&#039;s not to say that some scammer has decided, Ahh, Sites are getting Ddos&#039;d Im going to pretend im doing it and try and make some cash off it. <br />You would think that somebody who had a good enough working knowledge of computers to pull off an attack like this, let alone all the other sites if it is the same person, Could put together a ransom note that had proper wording and less spelling mistakes. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t seem to make sense that it is just one person either, I reckon it&#039;s a small community of them, Just because of the level of the attack. He had to ask for advice somewhere down the line, he will brag about it somewhere on the deepnet at some point, Surely at that point people can start putting 2 and 2 together. <br /><br />Of course you aren&#039;t going to fucking pay,&nbsp; If he admins were then they would be as well shutting Sr down now as they would keep coming back for more and more, Let alone the other groups that could and would start doing the same thing for thousands of pounds or dollars per time. <br /><br />The one thing though that im not sure of is whether or not a bounty for catching him is worthwhile. On one hand it would defo help to get groups to find out who he is and do whatever. <br />But on the other hand if you do that it&#039;s in the same boat as a ransom, In the sense that what is to stop another hacking group performing an attack on SR and then offering to help 2stop&quot; the attack for money. Basically getting a ransom without asking for it. <br /><br />I think the best solution is what DPR is already doing. Communicating with some of his fellow comrades he can trust and putting information together as best as they can. they haven&#039;t taken SR down yet so we are winning.&nbsp; I know for a fact there are hundreds of Sr users who are very competent on a PC that could more than likely make good contributions, which some of them probably already have. I also bet that Admins are reading this page and taking some good ideas from it , whether or not they are commenting on it or not. <br /><br />Id just like to say thanks to everyone contributing to helping stop the attack for putting so many hours and effort of work into helping keeping SR alive so that I and everybody else can benefit from it. It is appreciated.

				I think a lot of these people could be trying to take credit for the attacks, and not all of them are actually responsible. That happens a lot with anything like this. DPR would be smart enough not to pay any of these thugs a dime.

Bitcoin would certainly be a good candidate for that sort of thing, considering the large money recently going into it and the relatively feeble infrastructure.

				I have no idea about TOR software but, on the clearnet servers that were DOS&#039;d there should be a log of the botnet IPs... wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; one crazy option would be to locate one of these infected machines physically, and do full forensics in attempt to uncover C&amp;C data? I only know a little about IT but, I know it is pretty difficult to pull a stunt like this and leave no footprint.
