				&nbsp;I am a new anonymous customer joining the thousands of you , and taking the first step to purchasing has been quite the hassle. I reside in the USA and have searched handfuls of reputable exchange sites, but none seem to take VISA card in exchange for Bitcoins. Does anyone know of a fast and easy way I could use my credit card to buy Bitcoins? Are there any sites you would recommend? Any tips would be greatly appreciated! :)

				Well it would almost guarantee no anonymity for you if you used your VISA card. Saying that i dont know of a reputabke site that offers this service. If you dont care about being anonymous i suggest using mt gox or intersango and linking your bank account to it, that way you can transfer cash in, convert to BTC and send them to your SR account.<br /><br />Alternatively in the US you can send cash to Blue Sky Trades who will sell you BTC for cash.

At a MINIMUM if you do find a site that does it (which is not in their favor as you can cancel and claim fraud etc) go get a prepaid visa card loaded up so there&#039;s nothing linking you back to it. I spent a few weeks looking for a credit/paypal method and I decided to take advice I read in the forums. These members have been around awhile and it pays to read. The cc/paypal-&gt;btc is not a good way and you&#039;re having trouble finding it for a reason. That alone should tell you something.

				The easiest way for me to get bitcoin is via cash money wire at any Moneygram location.&nbsp; You can use a fake name, etc.&nbsp; Here is my experience:<br /><br />Went to Mtgox.com and logged in<br />Chose Fund Account and used &quot;Bitinstant&quot; (NOT Cash Deposit via Bitinstant)<br />Followed link to Bitinstant website and chose &quot;More Local Locations&quot; <br />Entered amount to deposit<br />That took me to ZipZap.com<br />Chose a location (I chose CVS)<br />Was able to print off a bill to be paid via MoneyGram<br />Went to CVS<br />Picked up the red phone<br />Had to enter invoice info from my printoff<br />Had some trouble entering the amount.&nbsp; Enter the whole dollars, then push *, then cents, then push #<br />Gave them a fake name, address and phone number<br />Went to the CVS counter and told them I needed to pay this overdue bill today<br />Clerk asked if I was Mr. Dimmydummydummerdorf.&nbsp; I said yes<br />She asked for my CVS rewards card - I declined<br />Gave her my cash<br />Had to sign a receipt - scribbled it<br />Given my receipt<br />I was never asked for ID<br /><br />When I got back to my office, a Bitinstant email was waiting saying my cash deposit was accepted.&nbsp; My money was available at Mtgox.&nbsp; I sent it to my SR account.&nbsp; The entire process (from website order to SR btc received) took 90 minutes - including drive time to and from CVS.<br /><br />I like the fact that the printout says it is a bill payment.&nbsp; The lady at CVS didn&#039;t bat an eye.&nbsp; She seemed familiar with ZipZap, so maybe people use it regularly for bill payments.<br /><br />This is how I will fund my account from now on.&nbsp; I can choose just about any moneygram location, so I can mix it up. <br /><br />Hope this helps.&nbsp; If anyone sees a security vulnerability in my process above, please point it out!!&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />(Edit:&nbsp; copied this from an earlier post and forgot to remove statement that I was still waiting for btc to arrive in my SR account)

				^<br />I used the same method but went to a local liquor store to avoid camera cooperation as much as possible. I used a real name because I was unsure if I was going to be ID&#039;d. Next time I won&#039;t have to but I didn&#039;t worry too much.<br /><br />I printed the &#039;invoice&#039; from bitinstant at mtgox as well, then talked to a lady on the phone who walked me through every step. My phone alerted me that my btc was successful within 5 minutes, probably less.<br />The transfer from mtgox to reflect in my SR account took about 2-3 hours and I was on edge but it finally went through and all was fine. The benefit for me was that it was open on weekends when banks weren&#039;t. <br /><br />I will do it again but I&#039;m watching the volatility of the btc market. I don&#039;t want to stock up while prices are higher and then they take a nose dive. I just want them to have them with no purchase in mind but I don&#039;t like the fluctuation factor enough to do that just yet.
