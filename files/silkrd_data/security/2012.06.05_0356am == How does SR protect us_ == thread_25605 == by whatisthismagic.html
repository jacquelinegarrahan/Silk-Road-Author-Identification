				I&#039;ve been wondering this for some time.&nbsp; Basically, in the unlikely event that SR got busted and servers got seized...how much would LE know?&nbsp; Are our messages and purchase history encrypted with the passwords we choose, or is it just sitting there on the servers?&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not a good idea to divulge specific details, but a bit of reassurance from the admins would be nice.&nbsp; Just something like &quot;If LE busted in, they won&#039;t know a thing&quot;, or &quot;If LE busts in, you&#039;re fine if your password is strong&quot;.&nbsp; Just my thought on the matter...

				If it was public as to DPR&#039;s security measures, we wouldn&#039;t be very secure.<br />I do know that there are backup measures in place, as this is apparent by the backup BTC addresses we have.<br /><br />Besides that, we use BTC on the site that are tumbled and untraceable. If you use encryption (as you should) then you should have no real worries.

				I wouldn&#039;t want DPR to make his security measures public at all, just give us a vote of assurance.&nbsp; The thing that makes me worried about it when once I transferred coins from MT Gox to my wallet, but somehow I sent like .5 to SR without washing them.&nbsp; The address I sent it to was in my transaction history.&nbsp; If LE were to find that address, it would be pretty easy to see in the blockchain how it went from MT Gox -&gt; My wallet -&gt; that SR address -&gt; a bunch of random dummy transactions.

				No amount of built-in protection by SR can protect you as much as you can protect yourself if you [all of you] follow one simple rule.<br /><br />Use GPG 100% of the time.&nbsp; No exceptions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re just sending someone a PM to say hi, or if you&#039;re exchanging the details of some 6-figure IRL meetup, every message you send to someone on SR should be GPG-encrypted.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because then you&#039;re taking responsibility for your own security, and even if the SR server(s) get completely pwn3d, you&#039;ve still got that one final layer of security.&nbsp; More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that doing this will remind you that despite all the layers of security, at the core, this is still a black market operation, and there&#039;s always risk involved, so hopefully you&#039;ll always remember to be smart about what you do, who you deal with, etc.

				I was just about to&nbsp; jump in and add to the posters comments about SR not revealing anything about it&#039;s self and it&#039;s practices, software, problems with said software which gives hints unless that information is leaked out.<br /><br />I wonder if diplomatic immunity would apply in the case if a head of stat or the like was the head and chief of this org. Also wonder if it could be handled under water&nbsp; because I know the gambling licenses in many states&nbsp; declare it illegal but if you&nbsp; go to the river or lake and set up shop on the water they can;t tough you.<br /><br />But I am simply&nbsp; making&nbsp; guess judgements off faulty&nbsp; memory and herr say.

				- i&#039;ve never heard / read any post of DPR/admins owning up to anything thats happened in the past, nothing more specific than &quot;we had a db issue&quot;<br />&nbsp; but think admins obviously do deal with a crisis now and again.<br /><br />- would be interesting though, to get a feel for how LE collectively work against &quot;us&quot; however disclosing too much detail like locations might not<br />&nbsp; be such a hot idea...each bit of info raises more questions and then someone could drop the wrong bit of info at times....so....the less we<br />&nbsp; know the better as you as the individual don&#039;t know any Silk Road nor representatives, the less you know less chance of being associated to it<br />&nbsp; as a buyer/vendor when you&#039;re being charged yourselves....right?!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; ..........dunno<br /><br /><br />

				Just going to throw it in here...one of the things I would like to know about SR, is if they do something smart, like take your password, sha-256 it, and use that as the key to encrypt all your data with AES-256.&nbsp; As far as oscarzululondon goes, if the ENTIRE EARTH was one big processor hashing at the speed of the Intel AES instruction set....it would still take thousands of years to crack that.&nbsp; If SR encrypted our data in this way, LE could not ever, ever, ever ever ever ever ever get our data.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t work like that.&nbsp; The thing that gets me is if I buy coins on Mt Gox, send them to my SR address, and SR servers get seized.&nbsp; That&#039;s my main concern.&nbsp; If they encrypted our data if the way I mentioned, we could fukin send out coins direct to SR from Mt Gox.&nbsp; As long as your password is good.&nbsp; ;)

				It doesn&#039;t matter even WPA passwords are no different than SHA-256 passwords, the only difference there is the amount of time it takes to see if your guess was correct, when you have to make billions of trillions of guesses it doesn&#039;t matter if you can guess and confirm as correct/incorrect hundreds of billions of passwords a second. The article he linked to said they cracked passwords up to six characters in 45 minutes, I don&#039;t know where the fuck he is getting 13 character passwords can be cracked from. a purely randomly generated 13 character ascii password is as secure as a 91 bit encryption algorithm that can only be broken by brute force.
