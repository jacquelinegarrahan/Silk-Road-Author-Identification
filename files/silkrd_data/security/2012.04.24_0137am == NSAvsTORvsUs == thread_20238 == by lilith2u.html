				The very people that have created the TOR network and run it are under attack by the NSA and so are whistle blowers in the NSA sheer intimidation and harassment, National security letters!.......They want in! They don&#039;t like it one goddamn bit, and there breaking more laws than we have ever thought of! The gloves are off....please check out&nbsp; https:Its//www.democracynow.org. Its very well explained and one of the developers of TOR is on also.&nbsp; Today&#039;s is part two from Fridays show......Video, podcast, iTunes.....whatever but this is important!&nbsp; <br />Its very freaky when you hear an American citizen say &quot;i can&#039;t answer that question or i will go to jail....I can&#039;t even tell my partner or mother because we don&#039;t live in a free country&quot;. This is called police state.

				For those of us who don&#039;t have time to check out the site/podcast in depth, could you elaborate, has something specific happened? Has the NSA made moves against TOR etc? Or is this just a general government vs Tor speculation thread?

				None of the above.&nbsp; The government doesn&#039;t like Jacob Appelbaum due to his involvement with Wikileaks.&nbsp; It has absolutely nothing to do with Tor.

				No I don&#039;t have the time! And yes it is Jacob Appelbaum And it most certainly has to do with Tor!......I&#039;m just saying check it out its important on a big picture sort of way! Not a &quot;There bringing down Tor&quot; but you they want to! or at the very least it sure pisses them off. Its 20 minutes if you don&#039;t care about such things then don&#039;t! It is important

				It&#039;s not Tor.<br /><br />Sure, maybe THEY don&#039;t like the fact that we&#039;re on here doing our various black-market deeds, facilitated by Tor, and maybe it sucks that Bad People(TM) can use it to do Bad Things(TM), but everyone who has even a passing bit of knowledge about it also knows that Tor serves a very legitimate purpose for the US government.&nbsp; I actually (pure conjecture here) don&#039;t think that even if they could get one of the core developers to backdoor the code that they would actually go ahead and do it - because if Nick or Roger or Jacob can put in some hidden &quot;features&#039; that help out the NSA, you can bet your ass that the Chinese government has enough smart dudes to find those &quot;features&quot; and turn them around against the dissidents in their own country or against foreign governments.<br /><br />Still not convinced?&nbsp; Think about the fact that Appelbaum was working on Tor for at least two years before the incident at HOPE 2010; prior to his stand-in for Julian Assange and his overt association with WikiLeaks, the government wasn&#039;t butt-raping the guy&#039;s civil rights every time he set foot in an airport.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong - we are absolutely living in scary times, and each president sets the stage for the next one to be even more of a rat bastard than the one that came before him - but personally, I&#039;m much more concerned about what they are going to do with that giant data center they&#039;re building in Utah than I am about any TLA assault on Tor.

Imagine if they had a machine that could scan all mail as it came in, and tell exactly what chemicals/atoms are inside each package. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if that was reality in 10-20 years. Hell, I wouldn&#039;t really be all that shocked if it existed already but wasn&#039;t declassified enough for mainstream use.

Another good one is &quot;Mohammed&quot; or &quot;pedophile&quot;. If you use them in the same sentence that&#039;s when shit can get pretty dangerous.
