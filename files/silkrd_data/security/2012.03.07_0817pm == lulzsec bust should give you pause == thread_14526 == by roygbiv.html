				I know the lulzsec guy was a douche, and ddos attacks lame, but the arrests are troublesome. What more proof do you need that the government is getting better at sleuthing? Furthermore, what more proof do you need that you are expendable and will be sold out when others are facing prison? I suppose the latter is nothing new. Ratting out is human nature.

				Not only that, these were VERY high value targets in the eyes of law enforcement. They&#039;d happily ignore a thousand drug dealers to bust up a high profile hacking ring that has been constantly waving their dicks in the faces of law enforcement for quite some time.<br /><br />But yeah, while their electronic surveillance was more sophisticated this time, this is still a bust that relied on an enormous amount of human intelligence from an informant. Take that away and this never happens.

In the future we will have a lot of capital. Right now we&#039;re like the hairline crack in the dyke, but we have the weight of the world on the other side. Can you sense it? The DEA can, they&#039;ve been having nightmares about &#039;precedent&#039; ever since.<br /><br />That makes all the difference in the world. We can keep going for the rest of our lives since it&#039;s in our direct self interest to, whereas Lulzsec was more of a fad, it was primarily dependent on the boundless energies of barely post-pubescent male mammals. Naive hunters! Morally flexible too, they turn on a dime. Sabu&#039;s ideology was extremely confused and internally inconsistent. But very exuberant about it all. The Silk Road is as ideologically driven as Anonymous, when DPR says we are revolutionaries he&#039;s not kidding, we want a new world too, we&#039;re just not using direct means to achieve it. <br /><br />Anonymous&#039;s propaganda is their main weapon, which is precisely why the FBI decided to use a psychological operation attack. It all seems very impressive at the time, but in the end manipulating capital is the tool that produces permanent change.<br /><br />Similarly, expect the DEA to attack our sources of finance through Bitcoin. They know that a dozen more Silk Roads can exist, but shutting down the source of exchange could have a lasting effect. However, they also know such an attack could rebound in their faces, which is why they are going to go for a Total Attack at some point. They&#039;ll put the hammer to all banks, exchanges, moneypaks, ukcash, you name it. That and a psychological operation attack simultaneously. They need to create a destructive narrative, I&#039;m sure their industrial psychologists are working on some appealing scenarios as we type.<br /><br />But in the end, they are doomed to fail, like I keep saying, in our economy, there is a perfect relationship between supply and demand. All buyers want some form of virtual currency and all sellers want cash. A perfect 1 to 1 mapping. Videogame currencies, mobile phone credit, the e-golds of the world, any of them can be used to implement.

That is a HUGE leap away from examining TOR traffic and determining that Joe Homeboy in San Fran is dealing drugs on the Silk Road. To wave your hands and try to pretend otherwise is to be disingenuous.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah they were &#039;high value&#039;&nbsp; but so is so SR. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />SR is not committing public acts of aggression, flaunting those acts publicly in the face of law enforcement, bragging about them to the media, going after the military-industrial complex, etc. SR is merely a marketplace, one that exists on many levels throughout the world, with or without SR. Lulzsec was a destructive force bent on promoting agenda through overt criminal attacks.<br /><br />They are NO WHERE NEAR each other in terms of priorities.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> LE is not gonna ignore &#039;drug dealers&#039; ... and if you believe they will,&nbsp; my buddy has&nbsp; a bridge at Brooklyn to sell you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course they aren&#039;t, you&#039;re taking what I said out of context. My point remains: the FBI would happily ignore a thousand drug dealers if it meant busting a high profile hacking ring. That is not equivalent to saying &quot;LE is gonna ignore drug dealers&quot; as you suggest. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Many people on here seem to rely on cognitive dissonance to help themselves sleep at night.&nbsp; Personally, I prefer xanax<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do us a favor and educate yourself before you start using big words.

If you can&#039;t exchange USD for bitcoins legally, this whole situation collapses on its head without the enormous, arduous task of trying to play whack-a-mole with all of the participants.<br /><br />Perhaps that will not be the end; plenty of counter arguments. However, the point is, I think this is the most likely avenue of attack that we would see from the US Government. Not attacks on TOR. Not LEO posing as vendors so they can bust buyers. They know that is a huge waste of time that will only serve to make the problem worse. The only way to truly deal with this is to try to close pandoras box and eliminate the ability for your average citizen to acquire pseudonymous crypto currency. Can they do that? Do they have the political will? <br />

				&nbsp;I think there were valid points to most of those posts. Should we not take into consideration how the laws seem to be changing quicker than one can keep up ( at least for a commoner such as myself)? for instance &quot;entrapment&quot; That one seems to be a joke? most all the terrorism cases in the last 10 years have been just that. Once your busted and have to get a lawyer and what not, your pretty much already fucked by then it seems to me. I do agree that if you give them a chance they will take it? I hate snitches just on a side note! and we need some push back anyway. don&#039;t be so quick to to bad mouth Anonymous. I kinda like that there out there monkey wrenching the system. if not them then who?

Even tried to hit him with a second felony because he used a cellphone to to set up the deal, which the prosecution argued was its own offense under a different statute. Made it all the way to the Supreme Court, luckily they rejected the cellphone+drugs=felony charge. <br /><br />!!!The case is worth reading just to see how the government may respond in the future to &#039;criminal&#039; use of technology!!! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Supreme Court is being asked to interpret the terms of the Controlled Substances Act (&quot;CSA&quot;), written by Congress as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Section 843(b), the section at the center of the controversy, states that it is &quot;unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to use any communication facility in committing or in causing or facilitating the commission of any [drug crime prohibited by the CSA].&quot; Amici in favor of Abuelhawa claim that Congress did not mean for this language to ensnare the buyers of illegal drugs for personal use, but instead intended to increase the penalties for drug dealers. Amici&#039;s argument is that Congress wanted drug dealers who tried to increase their productivity by using technology to face harsher penalties, but not necessarily drug users. The United States, on the other hand, feels the statute should be interpreted to include drug buyers as well as drug dealers, because possession of drugs for personal use is not always a misdemeanor, and Congress wanted the penalty to be increased for any person that uses technology to enhance the likelihood of a successful drug deal. Quoting the Fourth Circuit, the United States argues that &quot;communication facilities makes it easier for criminals to engage in their skullduggery, and Congress may reasonably have desired to increase criminal penalties for those who use such means to evade detection by law enforcement.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				OMG, it&#039;s like you read my mind. I, myself, find the pixels far beyond charismatic. I keep getting all flushed and breathless. It&#039;s like being in the presence of a young [redacted for an attempt at anonymity, insert idol name here].<br /><br />Wait, that would be the drugs. Wait, no, it&#039;s just me. Huh. [no interwebs while intoxicated, house rule]<br /><br />While theorizing in a reserpine-induced haze, it might be an idea to consider that the world is a diverse place and that the set SR of people who are online includes people who identify as {vendors, ideologues, casual users, dependent users, scammers, the terminally bored, LE pro, LE con, observers/researchers/writers/students, security/privacy aficionados, BTC investors, psychopharmacologists, cat owners, people who want start vending shipping product, defense attorneys, trolls, whatEVER}.<br />People can identify with a lot of these groups at once. I don&#039;t see most of the above as being mutually exclusive. In fact, I don&#039;t see your post and Pine&#039;s as being mutually exclusive.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing wrong with making money as a goal, last I checked, but, your gaggle of strawmen aside (&quot;grand new institution&quot; - wtff, is there a building campaign on here somewhere?), why is it incompatible with ideology? I think I can say safely that I&#039;ve combined 1) supporting myself and 2) working towards specific social goals and change.<br /><br />I agree that the odds that people will be hurt are high. They&#039;re also high when people ride in cars or take ibuprofen or become romantically involved. I&#039;m thinking most people on here have metaphorically read the back of the ticket. It would be so awesome if you would clarify your statement, because I&#039;m missing something.<br /><br />Also, if you could outline how this is a regression or atavism, I would appreciate it. I&#039;m a little dim today. I&#039;m not following the train of thought there. Thanks for your patience.<br /><br />--f.<br />

				When looking at the two occurrences (Sabu&#039;s apprehension and SR&#039;s life) I think its important to remember the scopes in which these subject fall. They are independent. And within the eye of US law, both are handled by very different agencies. The DEA and the FBI have different priorities and incompatible methods for dealing with these priorities. The concept of illicit drug purchases (amongst other contraband) through electronic means is a foreign concept to the masses, most will not understand the concept of TOR for many years. And the cessation of these illegal activities is a foreign area for most law enforcement. Lastly I would add, attention towards SR will be hard pressed. Most drug amounts sent out would fall under the attention of a local police force, which doubtfully has tech capabilities to track down any of these people. In most cases the local pushers themselves would be higher priority. <br /><br />P.S. - The opinions I hold reflect current affairs, I doubt things will be same in 5 years. Who knows, perhaps by then a Cyber-Narcotics division will have developed.

				Interpol already has a cyber narcotics division, but they primarily manage international operations against online pharmacies that pull in millions of dollars and compete with the pharmaceutical industry by disregarding intellectual property laws and FDA regulations. They generally are a major source of botnet funding / activity too, considering the massive amounts of spam they are behind. <br /><br />The FBI has done some major international operations against for profit CP sites, that are similar to adult porn sites but charge a membership fee. Reading about the security of these sites is always fun, they tend to use pretty shitty tactics but some are mildly impressive. The last really interesting one I read about used reverse proxies and money mule networks but the operators still were located and pwnt, I think they pulled in a few million in membership fees. When LE pwns one of these sites they tend to first covertly pwn the operators and then they gather customer intelligence for a period of months, followed by a massive internationally (usually interpol/europol) coordinated raid that pull in thousands or tens of thousands of buyers simultaneously. In the grand scheme of things the people using these sites almost never are pwnt with much CP compared to the trade groups, and they very rarely are part of distribution, but it doesn&#039;t stop LE from arresting them even if they bought a single picture.<br /><br />I guess it might not be a perfect analogy since CP is CP and drugs are drugs, but in for profit CP cases they do indeed carry out massive international operations that target even small time personal use customers. Part of me recognizes the difference between the two things, and part of me recognizes that mirror imaging is a common mistake in intelligence analysis, and that DEA agents may very well have a mentality that drug dealers and users are no better than CP purchasers. In my mind I can see a clear moral distinction, but it is probably not good to assume that the moral compass of the average DEA agent will mirror mine. Not to mention it is usually FBI pwning these CP sites and DEA has the *job* of pwning sites like SR, why should I think they will carry out their job to a lesser extent than the FBI carries out theirs?
