				I know how much of a HUGE pain in the ass it is to get bitcoins but i have found a GREAT place for bitcoin transactions, I have been using them exclusively now for a couple of months and now I wanted to share it with everyone else on SR since I see a lot of people having probs getting btc.&nbsp; they accept all kinds of payment including western union and others, the website is https://www.canadianbitcoins.com and despite the name, they deal with everyone, anywhere, not just canada! I can vouch for them completely, they are fast and completely trust worthy, mention that I (wumg) sent you and they will def treat you right since I send them a lot of biz, not to mention all of my biz!<br />&nbsp;Hope this helps some people out! be safe everyone!&nbsp; 8)

				I can also vouch for canadianbitcoins.com - excellent transaction, had my coins within an hour (they pick up W.U. payments once a day at a certain time and I sent the transfer an hour before this), and I got them at a price that was actually lower than the Gox price with their discount rate.<br /><br />@synths &amp; @Reseller:<br /><br />The subject of the linked thread is a vendor on SR, &quot;CanadianCoins&quot;, who as far as I&#039;m aware, is completely unrelated to canadianbitcoins.com<br /><br />I was a little afraid to throw their info up here in case they ran out of Bitcoins and I&#039;d be left in the lurch, but I reckon they should get all the support they can!<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				ya these are two different websites completely. i can guarantee they are not scammers, I send them thousands of dollars of btc a week and the ALWAYS comet through and i have been dealing with them not for 2 months. also, I have been sending them a lot of business and everyone I have sent has had a positive experience. Anyways, in conclusion, these are two totally different sites and companies/people, if you need btc, https://www.canadianbitcoins.com will def take care of you well and they are certainly not scammers, I would not put my name to it if I had any doubt at all that they are totally legit!

Most places give you the market price minus a fee but it looks like their buy price per coin includes their fee.

				I&#039;m using this site to get 400+ in btc. It&#039;s a 40 dollar fee, but like the guy said, if you do it before the pick up at Wu you will get it in a hour. I missed it so I should be getting them around 2pm tomorrow. And it was 40cents lower for btc than mtgox rate with the discount offer!<br /><br />Awesome possum! <br /><br />But I&#039;ll ask nextime, or someone ask for me, it the next day deposit takes exactly 24hrs or does it mean after 12am?<br /><br />Cause the fee is more if you do deposit in minutes...but they seem to do Electric transfers and there is no fee, but you have to go up from 20$,50$,100%,200$, ect. But maybe if you email them with some good bs on why they should let you do a bigger transfer then maybe!<br /><br />But for WU there is no limit or starting amount. <br /><br />I wish I could do get-btc boa deposit. Last time i did that I got that shit in 2 hours! that was 3 days ago!! FUCK!

				Just want to add some caution here: I just got burned by some BTC seller on SR advertising himself<br />as &#039;CanadianCoins&#039;... SR has taken down that scammer&#039;s account. However, your not the first person to give good reviews about that CanadianBitCoins web-site... I guess their different entities. Personally I think I might give the Canadian Virtual Exchange a try next time: they seem really legit.&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)
