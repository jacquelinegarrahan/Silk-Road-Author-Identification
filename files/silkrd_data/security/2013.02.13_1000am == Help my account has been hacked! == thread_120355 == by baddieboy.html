				I reported your post to the moderators. I figured this would be the quickest way to get the best solution to your situation. <br /><br />Otherwise, my only idea would be to sign up for a new account, and go to the bottom right of the welcome screen, and click on &quot;Support&quot;. <br /><br />Good luck man! I hope you didn&#039;t have to many btcs in there. <br /><br />Do you think it&#039;s someone you know? Friend or relative who&#039;d be able to possibly guess your password?<br /><br />Or are you just locked out??<br /><br />Did you check the obvious things like the screen said (Congrats you are using Tor)<br />And you are not using a cap where you should be using lower case?<br /><br />Sometimes obvious mistakes are misinterpreted as being hacked. <br /><br />Also could try having a friend you trust on here, try to PM you with a benign question, like &quot;Hey are you interested in those free samples?&quot; <br /><br />Just some random thoughts. <br /><br />Hope I helped you in some way. <br /><br />Good Luck Man,<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				Reiterating what samesamebutdifferent said, you&#039;ll need to report it to SR Support because there&#039;s nothing we can do here.&nbsp; Best of luck!

				Send SR support a message from a new account. <br /><br />If you can give them a list of previous transactions including order/withdrawals, the dates of these transactions, and the amounts. they MIGHT let you back into the account with this info

I think the name should be change from PIN to something like, Transaction Password, Withdrawal Code, ETC. Too many people use numbers o make their pin when it can be any Letter (upper and lower case) or number.<br /><br />My pin is about 12 characters long

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />I put my sign info into a phishing site but put in the wrong pin by accident.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find the site to put out a warning though.<br /><br />I have contacted SR support but no reply so far.<br /><br />I placed two orders which I reckon have been cancelled and the BTC stolen it was only 1.80 BTC but I am still pissed.

				Fuck. I can&#039;t login either. Right when they added the &quot;pin&quot; to the login screen. I have less than a coin in there but I just received a fairly valuable package and can&#039;t finalize!! I&#039;ll try the new account &amp; support thing. Any other ideas?<br /><br />Edit: Problem solved. No help needed, maybe just building up my self esteem after making such an ass of myself... only joking.
