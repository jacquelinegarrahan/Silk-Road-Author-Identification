				Title: <strong>Secure VM Reward</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;m offering 5 bitcoins to anyone who will tell me a step-by-step guide to creating a secure VM that meets the following specifications:<br /><br />-Leaves no traces on my computer. This especially means no traces of the USB drive password, of the VM being used, Tor, or anything else that could be incriminating.<br />-Resides on a hidden partition of a Truecrypt encrypted USB drive.<br />-Routes all its Internet traffic through Tor.<br />-Reveals no metadata identifying the owner in receiving or transmitting data.<br />-Holds the bookmark and password data I have now in my Tor browser (I&#039;d move all necessary data to this VM). <br />-If possible to meet the previous specifications, I&#039;d like to avoid using Linux (it&#039;s too complicated for me).<br />I&#039;m currently using Windows. <br /><br />The reward will be paid within a week of my receiving the instructions.<br /><br />Thanks so much for any assistance.

				http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/secureconfig/tutorial.html<br /><br />There are some changes to be made though. First off, use privoxy instead of polipo; second, send firefox traffic through tor&#039;s socks5 proxy. Also, you&#039;ll need to grab python from the openbsd repository and not compile it yourself, that probably won&#039;t work. To make the whole setup portable, use the vbox.me flavor of virtualbox (you will need to enable the network driver on your first run). To keep your bookmarks, you&#039;d have to create them before your master snapshot. And &quot;secure&quot; and &quot;Windows&quot; are mutually exclusive. :-p

				Maybe setting up a series of vms will be a little beyond you then. What&#039;s your current setup like? Using liberte on an encrypted thumb drive isn&#039;t bad by any means and is much easier to use.

				Liberte linux is a Linux distribution which can be stored on an encrypted usb drive and leaves no traces on the system it&#039;s running on. It&#039;s built on top of a very secure operating system (hardened Gentoo is my favorite actually) and all networking activity is automatically routed through Tor. There are also apps for editing documents, images, etc. http://dee.su/liberte<br /><br />Also see this guide: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9067

Liberte sounds pretty cool from the links. So, does &quot;Linux distribution&quot; mean a Linux based operating system?<br />So, are there apps that can handle word documents? Between a VM and Liberte, does one hold an advantage over the other in security terms?<br /><br />Edit: You&#039;ve earned the 5 bitcoins. Just pm me your bitcoin address, and I&#039;ll deposit them within a week from now. <br /><br />I might need your help later though when installing and running Liberte.
