				So im fairly new to SR, mostly have been browsing to get a feel. I was wondering if any of you veterans out there feel friendly enough to through out a few basic pointers to get me in the right direction.... <br />&nbsp;- main questions are is it ok to make transfers from online bank accounts into bitcoins if only buying a few things?<br />- who to trust on the site/who to not trust on the site?<br />- anything suspicious to look out for?<br />- any advice you deem worthy of telling would be MUCH appreciated. just trying to get myself educated before makin any moves<br />thanks!

				Thanks, looks like that covers everything i need. Only question is when you go to the bank, do the tellers ever ask for an identification card? Do you have to announce your name or any info? or do you simply just hand the payslip with the cash and say your paying a bill, with no questions asked? I just feel like a bank teller may think its suspicious, but that might be because i&#039;ve never done it before....<br /><br />Thanks for helping out

So just tell them you forgot it. If they try to deny you, tell them that you heard it wasn&#039;t required. That will make them check, see that you&#039;re right, then they&#039;ll shut up. Or if it is required... dunno what to tell you. Last I heard though, it isn&#039;t.
