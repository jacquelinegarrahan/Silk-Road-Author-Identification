The website includes information on how to package, handle and distribute the drugs.<br /><br />Users can also access information on how to avoid scrutiny by police and get feedback on the quality of the drugs on offer.<br /><br />Users must use a digital currency that is not regulated and difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace.<br /><br />The boys&#039; parents approached Esperance police because they were concerned at packages they were receiving through the mail.<br />Staff at the local Australia Post sorting depot had also become concerned. Detectives launched an investigation dubbed Operation Cinder and identified the source of the drugs as The Silk Road.<br /><br />
