				if you haven&#039;t even found the information to GET btc, then you definitely don&#039;t know enough about security to be ordering yet.&nbsp; please read more before you start ordering.&nbsp; don&#039;t let the excitement get the best of you.&nbsp; look at it this way:&nbsp; just a few days ago, you probably didn&#039;t even know about SR.&nbsp; just keep doing whatever you were doing before while you do your research for a week or two.

You can do cash deposits at their banking locations for 3% in US, not sure where you are so you&#039;ll have to check their site and locale exchange rates and money will post to your bitcoin wallet in an hour.<br /><br />You need to either install bitcoin wallet locally, and use the public hash address app provides as your wallet id or use reputable hybrid online wallet service. Give wallet hash to bank when making your deposit. After money is deposited you will see your new balance reflected in wallet.&nbsp; Remember if you lose wallet for any reason you lose your money. it&#039;s like real cash. that&#039;s why wallet services like blockchain.info are quite useful.<br /><br />If you prefer not to be on cctv going in bank to make deposit then find someone in your local area to sell you bitcoins for cash. this is pretty easy if you live in any major city. btcnearme.com is good for that. Or you can use various SR vendors to exchange cash for bitcoins if you don&#039;t mind paying their exchange rate.<br /><br />biggest bitch to patronizing SR is all the mad drama you must suffer just so you can. it&#039;s an ongoing saga figuring how to quickly turn cash into bitcoins if you don&#039;t have patience for wire transfer waits unless you have enough liquidity to do one large bitcoin buy and sit on it.

				Oh, and one more thing. I absolutely agree with tootiefruity. While I gave a brief rundown that should give you some ideas, I can&#039;t stress to you how important it is to spend the time doing your own research and figuring out the best methods that work for you and how best to protect yourself. Spend a week or two familiarizing yourself with the technology while you&#039;re going through the laborious process of hunting down the best method for you to transfer your money to bitcoins. That&#039;s the best way to stay safe.

				We all had to go thru what you are going thru.&nbsp; After learning about TOR--at first, just how *slow* it is, like dial-up used to be.&nbsp; Then we get to Silk Road (SR), and get all excited seeing the goodies, and want btc, no matter what the price.&nbsp; I actually bought them on PayPal...*Not* recommended.&nbsp; Security should be starting to be very important to you.&nbsp; Others have mention some of the various ways of getting btc.&nbsp; You can also buy them on here--I&quot;ve bought them with no problems from btc Buddy, btc King, and btc Pal.&nbsp; Sugar Mama is also known to be reliable.&nbsp; But you also have no protection doing it that way, and periodically there are scammers.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you learn to navigate these forums here, so you can learn who is trustworthy...this week ha ha....<br /><br />I bought mine thru dwolla and TradeHill, thru bitinstant.&nbsp; TradeHill went under, and for about a week, neither they, nor bitInstant did anything but help me...finally, tho, they paid up...best advice, what I did, join:&nbsp; https://bitcointalk.org/&nbsp; There is a beginners section, and I spent a couple of days on there, just learning all about btc and getting much good advice.&nbsp; Hint: they aren&#039;t all thrilled by SR, so I wouldn&#039;t tell them that is why you want them...but you can learn how to get btc., and how to save them.&nbsp; I use strictly online wallets, like instawallet myself, but learn and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with the &#039;account&#039; page on your SR site.&nbsp; Much is explained just by looking at that: how much is in your account, what you btc address is (I&#039;d write it down somewhere in a file, save it on Desktop maybe.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Lots of studying to do, again: we had to do it, nobody can do it for you.&nbsp; Another good spot to start: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page<br /><br />OK, that&#039;s enough homework for the weekend...&nbsp; ;)

				it&#039;s really frustrating at first when you see a great deal here and you have to watch as others buy it and you miss out but don&#039;t worry about that because there&#039;s always new great deals popping up. It really pays to be patient
