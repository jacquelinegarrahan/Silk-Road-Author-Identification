				So I&#039;ve been using Dwolla and Bit-instant to get bitcoins. <br /><br />The last time I bought them, I was able to deposit them directly to my bitcoin wallet, then to SR. <br /><br />Now, Bitinstant seems to no longer have an option to buy bitcoins through Dwolla and to deposit them into your wallet. So where else exactly can I go to buy bitcoins through Dwolla to be deposited at a specific bitcoin address?

				I&#039;m having similar issues with bitinstant. I&#039;m trying out Blue Sky Traders a SR Vendor today who does bank deposit directly to SR. You can then move from your SR wallet as you see fit. My first time using them but they have good feedback. I&#039;ll put up a post and let you know how it went.

				I&#039;m just so goddamn sick of how difficult this is without bringing every scrap of identifying material that you own and giving it to some company.<br /><br />I just got setup with bitcoins (Took me a month of waiting for transfers, approvals, verifications, etc. I tried submitting three or four sets of documents to Mt. Gox before I said &#039;fuck it&#039; and went to Bitinstant.) and made my first two purchases yesterday, and now I can&#039;t buy anymore bitcoins because Bitinstant decided that they won&#039;t be doing deposits into bitcoin wallets anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />They&#039;re making so that no matter where the fuck I try to get bitcoins, every step of the process must involve who knows absolutely everything about me and gets a cut of my money. It&#039;s bullshit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59368.msg548918#msg548918">Quote from: patswin on October 27, 2012, 01:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m having similar issues with bitinstant.

				I feel your frustrations. It&#039;s the biggest pain in the ass to the whole market. I did want to follow up though on my deposit experience this morning with Blue Sky Traders. Placed an &quot;order&quot; through SR, got deposit instructions and a quote with how many BCs I&#039;d be getting for the deposit amount, went to make the deposit and before I got back home from making the cash deposit the money was already in my SR account. Very quick. Quickest way by far I&#039;ve ever gotten bitcoins and yet the same work or less on my end then my usual bitinstant cash deposit. Good communication, quick processing, reasonable fee. I would use again and recommend!

				JAA- Blue Sky posts his rate daily on his vendor page. So he pegs what you&#039;ll pay per BC from him based on market price. It&#039;s not a % of the transaction. Hope that helps buddy. I haven&#039;t used Dwolla myself Asbury so I can&#039;t help much there, sorry.

				It is disappointing having to revert back to the old way of getting coins. For now.<br /><br />But please, stop bitching about it. Compared to other shit in this world, its a walk in the fuckin park to get coins and buy illegal product. Suck it up, STAY ANONYMOUS, and profit.<br /><br />And to the guy with no car.... I&#039;d say you&#039;re either too poor to be buying drugs, or too young. Please make smart life decisions bro. Drugs should be a hobby, not a priority...<br /><br />

				It&#039;s looking like we&#039;re gonna have to use Mt Gox or BTC-E and then transfer them to out SR accounts for now. Problem is I have no idea how to use those two&nbsp; :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;(
