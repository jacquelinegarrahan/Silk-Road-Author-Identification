				Okay so I sometimes use hushmail.com to send email when I&#039;m using the tor browser bundle. Earlier today I go to check my email and get the following message:<br /><br />&quot;The computer you are using has been blocked from our website, possibly due to abuse or spam. Computers are blocked using an automatic process that will sometimes make mistakes, resulting in people who were not abusing the system being unable to access our website.&quot;<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know what had triggered the issue so I emailed them but in the meantime I closed tor and restarted it all and tried logging in and got the same message. I assumed then that it must be the account that was locked, as tor is supposed to make me anonymous... but out of curiousity I tried restarting tor again and setting up a new email adderss... I was most concerned when I got the&nbsp; *same message!* <br /><br />How the hell has this website managed to block my computer from using their services? I thought Tor was supposed to make me anonymous? Are sites able to store cookies and things on my computer even if I close the tor browser and restart it? How else can they be doing this? I&#039;m a little freaked out... is tor as anonymous as people make out?

				just occurred to me. It&#039;s probably not that they identify tor, but that they can&#039;t identify your computer because your ip is different all the time.

				Over 80% of tor traffic exits through one of 7 exit nodes. <br /><br />These are all high speed (100MB/sec to 300MB/sec, and one 1000MB/sec) nodes operated by the fine folks who bring you TOR.<br /><br />This also makes for a lot of abuse traffic from those exit nodes, so quite a few sites block them due to that.<br /><br />Some sites block ALL exit nodes from TOR, imgur for example.<br /><br />A complete list of all TOR relays and exit nodes is publically available, so that&#039;s not hard to do at all.<br /><br />The folks at Hushmail co-operate dilligently with law enforcement, and using their email gives you a false sense of security, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend it at all.<br /><br />EDIT: Current TOR relay/exit node list: hxxps://metrics.torproject.org/networkstatus.html

				Do not use hushmail. I have heard nothing but bad shit about them over the years. The member above me is 100% correct about how they cooperate with LE.

It does have one very Tor-unfriendly security feature of forcing you to re-enter your password whenever your IP address changes, but this can be disabled.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Godammit.<br /><br />DO NOT fuck around with features you do not understand, and DO NOT disable the re-verify password on IP change feature on safe-mail.net, or any other site you access over TOR. That is a TOR-friendly feature, in fact designed so the site can *safely* be used when your IP address changes often.<br /><br />Safe-mail is attempting to ensure that it continues to be YOU, and not someone pretending to be you using a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to impersonate you and hijack your session, thereby gaining unrestricted access to your email account. As early as 4 years ago Mike Perry reported at the Black Hat 2007 Conference (hxxp://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Perry/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-perry-WP.pdf) that during TOR Centralized Bandwidth and Load Scanning tests that replay attacks by Chinese ISP&#039;s running nodes was very common. I&#039;m sure since then everyone from the DEA to the NSA down to the local script kiddie on your block has got into the action.<br /><br />Safe-mail, or any other site for that matter, uses several metrics to ensure that you are still you durring a session. First off, it uses a unique session fingerprint when you first connect, which includes information from your connecting IP address. This is enough for the server, but might not be available or sufficient for the SAS app you are connecting to. To allow for changing IP&#039;s, the SAS further relies on either cookies, whether written to disk or ethereal session cookies, and possibly a unique session id.<br /><br />Forcing an SAS app to rely on the session id alone is where you are inviting trouble. A malicious node intercepts your traffic, and replays it, pretending it came from them. They can be impersonating either you or the site at this point in time - they don&#039;t know which is which, and it doesn&#039;t matter to them. What they&#039;re waiting for is a successful response. If they replay a session of yours with a valid session id, but from a different IP address, the only way they are going to get in is if you have disabled the SAS apps IP address checking feature.<br /><br />Also note that it doesn&#039;t matter that TOR has encrypted the packet(s) they&#039;re relaying. The attacker isn&#039;t trying to read your packets, it&#039;s trying to use them as a key. If all that takes is replaying an encrypted session id, they then simply act like they got a 304 in repsonse, and the SAS app host then merrily renegotiates a NEW encrypted session, which is now that attacker playing merrily about in your mailbox.<br /><br />Keep in mind, all this is automated on their end, and a malicious node can sift through billions of packets until it sees potential session header response packets, and then try to hijack millions of those.<br /><br />All day.<br /><br />Every day.<br /><br />Finally, this shit isn&#039;t just &#039;theoretical&#039; like the bullshit about you having to wipe your drive 35 times with different random data to safely delete it. (You don&#039;t, btw.) TOR by design changes your exit relay every 10 minutes under most circumstances, and gives you a new relay node each session. (Generally speaking, you only ever use 2 Guard nodes, which never change.) This gives malicious nodes lots of opportunities to sift through new traffic.<br /><br />A peek at my TOR logs for the last 24 hours shows the following attempts by unknown third parties to initiate MITM / replay attacks:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Jul 30 19:32:34.396 [Warning] Possible replay detected!

We received an INTRODUCE2 cell with same first part of Diffie-Hellman handshake 1 seconds ago. Dropping cell.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Note that these attempts at replay attacks are common, and aren&#039;t directed at anyone in particular, but rather are a wide net cast by malicious exit and relay nodes, and even possibly a &#039;trusted&#039; guard node.<br /><br />So when your IP address changes, and safe-mail asks you to verify you are really you before proceeding, smile, and thank the folks who put that feature in there to protect you.

Running TOR with malicious javascript hooks disabled, of course, and noscript, on a windows boxen.<br /><br />In neither email is anything close to my real IP revealed, merely the exit nodes used.<br /><br />email addy&#039;s have been changed to protect the innocent, but nothing else.<br /><br />One email is from an external hotmail account to safe-mail, and the other is forwarded from within safe-mail to another safe-mail account.<br /><br />There is about an eight minute difference between them as I took the time to set up a second safe-mail test account to forward to.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From xxtestxxaccountxx@safe-mail.net Sun, 31 Jul 2011 15:33:30 -0400<br />Received: from gefen.safe-mail.net ([192.168.13.74])<br />&nbsp;by tapuz.safe-mail.net with smlocal (smtas 1.2);<br />&nbsp;Sun, 31 Jul 2011 15:33:38 -0400<br />DomainKey-Status: not-signed (failed-get-policy)<br />X-SMTests: G00nmp0i0b0ar00u<br />Received: from mailout-us.gmx.com ([74.208.5.67])<br />&nbsp;by gefen.safe-mail.net with esmtp (smtpd 1.0)<br />&nbsp;id N1G-4qyJM5JTl4<br />&nbsp;for xxtestxxaccountxx@hotmail.live.com; Sun, 31 Jul 2011 15:33:30 -0400<br />Received-SPF: no-spf<br />Received: (qmail 24710 invoked by uid 0); 31 Jul 2011 19:33:30 -0000<br />Received: from 78.31.70.182 by rms-us017 with HTTP<br />Content-Type: multipart/alternative;<br />&nbsp;boundary=&quot;========GMXBoundary53781312140810100682&quot;<br />Date: Sun, 31 Jul 2011 19:33:28 +0000<br />From: xxtestxxaccountxx@safe-mail.net<br />Message-ID: &lt;20110731193330.53780@gmx.com&gt;<br />MIME-Version: 1.0<br />Subject: Headers<br />To: xxtestxxaccountxx@hotmail.live.com<br />X-Authenticated: #118378635<br />X-Flags: 0001<br />X-Mailer: GMX.com Web Mailer<br />x-registered: 0<br />X-GMX-UID: O5wTZiuyiDz7bqN0ZGxpq5drZml1ZFiU<br /><br />--========GMXBoundary53781312140810100682<br />Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;<br />Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit<br /><br />Headers.<br /><br />&nbsp;How do they work?<br /><br />--========GMXBoundary53781312140810100682<br />Content-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;<br />Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">DomainKey-Signature: a=rsa-sha1; q=dns; c=nofws;<br />&nbsp;s=N1-0105; d=Safe-mail.net;<br />&nbsp;b=d9Vi2+AeInZtNvk3U3vJN492sqVzbqrxhSzF8Pjs9LpWMHtHOKCUaB8fcSfu8UDr<br />&nbsp;FJoiqkT857jAhvf00Jwy50bEmw5FjfdEzj6EnC/6+Vf2CMN+JufThH0JIixKthEL<br />&nbsp;gSP8Zz5q0iivkXWnUNMyq8U/DJ/bsljQDvuQF617zvw=;<br />Received: from pc ([94.103.170.233]) by Safe-mail.net with https<br />Subject: Re: Headers<br />Date: Sun, 31 Jul 2011 15:41:42 -0400<br />From: xxtestxxaccountxx@hotmail.live.com<br />To: xxtestxxaccountxx@safe-mail.net<br />X-SMType: Regular<br />X-SMRef: N1-EvzV8Hrzer<br />Message-Id: &lt;N1-EvzV8Hrzer@Safe-mail.net&gt;<br />MIME-Version: 1.0<br />Content-Type: multipart/alternative;<br />&nbsp;boundary=&quot;-----5KVYT3G4Q6BC2-4E35AFF6.7AD9-L9Y0JA6PWR4JQ-----&quot;<br />X-SMSignature: mkSHbAnuhyZAIzsyTBgWgTSHK7ZZPbKU0U2NYx2RsuW/xk7P2tm530HEega2GV3P<br />&nbsp;/eupRnxJLMe42CJzQD7RTCY/8Q6Fap4aNoOzppaBrc3ggH7TUAaZdFWUv+0dr74k<br />&nbsp;lgA5FfgzSlitow2m7WXNj2pcxcH41kjpd1cbykhXK2s=<br /><br />This is a multi-part message in MIME format.<br /><br />-------5KVYT3G4Q6BC2-4E35AFF6.7AD9-L9Y0JA6PWR4JQ-----<br />Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii<br />Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br /><br /><br /><br />-------- Original Message --------<br />From: xxtestxxaccountxx@hotmail.live.com<br />To: xxtestxxaccountxx@safe-mail.net<br />Subject: Headers<br />Date: Sun, 31 Jul 2011 19:33:28 +0000<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&gt; Headers.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; How do they work?<br /><br />-------5KVYT3G4Q6BC2-4E35AFF6.7AD9-L9Y0JA6PWR4JQ-----<br />Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii<br />Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Hushmail deserves a thread on its own, and that&#039;s something I&#039;ll get to in the next day or so, but the short version is DO NOT EVER USE HUSHMAIL.<br /><br />If you allow the javascript hooks that are required to download and run the hushmail java applet, it reports back your true IP address.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t allow the javascript applet, even once, your account is forever comprimised as hushmail stores the symetric key (the important thing your Public Key wrapper protects!) required to decrypt your messages. Changing your password doesn&#039;t make a difference.<br /><br />Any email account should be treated like a post card.<br /><br />Anyone can read it.<br /><br />If YOU don&#039;t encrypt it yourself, it is vulnerable to unwanted third parties reading it.<br /><br />You CAN NOT rely on a third party safely encrypting data for you.<br /><br />TL:DR<br />Neither safe-mail or hotmail reveal your true IP address when you are using TOR properly.<br />Neither safe-mail or hushmail encryption is a substitute for encrypting things yourself before you send them.<br />Their encryption is a marketing ploy, and not a substitute for safe data handling habits.
