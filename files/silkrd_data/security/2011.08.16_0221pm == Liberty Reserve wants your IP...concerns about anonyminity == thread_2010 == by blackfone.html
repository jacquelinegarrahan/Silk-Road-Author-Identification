				Hello everyone, I&#039;ve read through the forums and I think I have a grasp on the process for turning Bitcoin into cash. SR(Tumbled by SR*)&gt;BTC Wallet&gt;Tumbler&gt;Transfer between BTC Wallets&gt;Mnt Gox/tradehill&gt;LR&gt;Debit Card<br /><br />I hope I have this right, my question is about LR being anonymous. I tried to sign-up but they won&#039;t allow a TOR IP address, they want your IP; which can be used to identify you. I have concerns about that. Just wondering how everyone else handled this situation or if it&#039;s of any concern, I know you can signup with any information; so I guess it&#039;s anonymous in that sense but you would still have to expose an IP.<br /><br />Has there been any threads where someone has actually traced BTC transactions, I just don&#039;t know if I trust that SR&#039;s tumbler is effective. I&#039;m still looking through the threads but if anyone can link me to help answer my questions and calm my concerns that would be great.<br /><br />Thanks

				&quot;... they want your IP; which can be used to identify you.&quot;&nbsp; You&#039;re damn straight on that one.&nbsp; Even if you&#039;re piggybacking off of your neighbor&#039;s Internet connection via an unsecured router, the Internet service provider (ISP) is collecting data which can identify your computer.&nbsp; The MAC address of your network card is a unique number that is probably being recorded by the ISP you use. <br /><br />That said, it&#039;s not a crime to own Bitcoins.&nbsp; Just remember that any clearnet site you&#039;ve connected to has info that can be used to track you. So either stay away from clearnet sites or find a way to break the connection between Bitcoin transactions you&#039;ve made and the transfer of those Bitcoins to/from SilkRoad.

				<br />&nbsp;Why should I post this to a PM, and who would I email about this? I will try and follow etiquette, but I don&#039;t see how/why this could have been posted differently. Please inform me and I can adjust my actions accordingly.<br /><br />Can anyone else comment on SR blocking TOR IP&#039;s(exit nodes)?<br /><br />This seems to me like a huge security liability. I don&#039;t want to say to&nbsp; much (Ahem) since apparently I didn&#039;t ask in the right place, hopefully someone will nudge me where I belong to ask such things.<br /><br />Thanks

				Discussed by PM to who? This seems like a legit question that will affect all of us. I have read in multiple threads that SR&gt;series of tumblers&gt;LR&gt;debit card is the accepted way to get your SR btc to a useable medium for spending. So is there a way to do that without giving up an ip address? I guess the alternative would be to do it from a public wifi signal in a coffee shop or some such but it would be great if there was another way. Thoughts?

				I meant to say that answers contain tumbler name and other particular information can be sent to OP with pm.<br />Of course other info (general) can be posted here.<br />Just keep in mind that this is &quot;open&quot; forum connected closely to SR market activity.<br />I&nbsp; think that mentioning LR or other service here can provoce those services and they can respond in some unknown way to prevent linking their name with SR on forums and other.<br />Just my 2c do not take it offensive.
