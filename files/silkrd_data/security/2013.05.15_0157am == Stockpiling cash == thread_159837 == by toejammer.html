				If one were to do such a thing. U know carry more than 10g&#039;s around or stockpile cash in excess of 50k. Is there an un traceable bag or container that would be better then the other. <br /><br />Thanks and if it&#039;s be discussed please just point me there.

Print out a fake bill of sale for an automobile and write today&#039;s date down along with the amount of cash you have. Keep your cash neat. Save template of bill of sale and keep printing them out and filling them in whenever you need to move around with seizable amounts of ill gotten gains.

				So here&#039;s the problem with burying it, especially if you don&#039;t have a cell to get the exact coordinates of the location: you might not find it again.&nbsp; Or maybe worse, somebody else will find it one day before you end up getting to it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t much care for that idea, personally.<br /><br />The problem with a bank is... well, that&#039;s pretty obvious i think.&nbsp; Lots of problems there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like it.<br /><br />The problem with an out-of-country bank like an offshore account or something, is that you&#039;re basically trusting the stability of the government in that area.&nbsp; A lot of people got burned by the recent Cyprus thing.&nbsp; The government said &quot;all this money in the banks?&nbsp; Yeah, we need that now.&nbsp; We&#039;ll pay you back.&nbsp; Someday.&nbsp; With interest.&nbsp; Sorta.&quot;&nbsp; In their defense, their hands were pretty much tied... country was literally on the verge of collapse.&nbsp; But they still stole millions from non-citizens.&nbsp; SO, bottom line: I don&#039;t like this idea either.<br /><br />Keep it with you, like in your immediate vicinity?&nbsp; Well that&#039;s really problematic, unless it&#039;s extremely well hidden, you might as well just keep it in a backpack that you bring from room to room in your house.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like this one any more than the others.<br /><br />... bitcoins.&nbsp; Volatile.&nbsp; Could lose all their value before you really had a chance to notice and liquidate.&nbsp; So it&#039;s risky -- probably even risker than the others, to be frank -- but at least with this one, you also have the potential for that risk to turn into massive profit if the price of BTC rises over time.&nbsp; And even if someone gets their hands on your computer, they can&#039;t get to your bitcoins.&nbsp; Even if they burn your house down and shred your entire computer system, they still can&#039;t get to your bitcoins.&nbsp; Even the government is powerless to get at those fucking bitcoins.<br /><br />That one I kinda like.&nbsp; But again, it has it&#039;s own problems with volatility and how quickly they could be liquidated if the necessity arose.&nbsp; Just my thoughts, take &#039;em for what they&#039;re worth.

				I&#039;ve always found cash to be bothersome. It takes up a lot of space and can deteriorate etc.<br /><br />Burying is a sound method of hiding it in the short term, I&#039;d recommend vac sealing stacks of it which shrinks it down massively, then putting it in a pelican case/otter box case etc and burying in somewhere away from your property. Try to choose a location that isn&#039;t suitable for development/road constructions etc and record the GPS location of it. Keep the co-ordinates saved in an encrypted file on your computer or a USB drive etc as well as a back up copy of the co-ordinates as a phone number or something that blends in.

				I forgot my main point!<br /><br />If you&#039;re thinking long term stockpiling or have larger amounts of cash (100s of 1000s+) you&#039;re best off buying other tangible but untraceable goods with them such as uncut diamonds, gold jewelry/coins that get melted down and turned into other jewelry/bullion etc<br /><br />These tend to hold their value or increase in value and are a lot easier to hide.

				It obviously depends how much cash we&#039;re talking about. First, I&#039;d recommend converting at least 20% of your stash into gold bullion, prices of gold have dropped recently so now is a very good time to buy. If it&#039;s only a few tens of thousands, get a good fire-proof safe and hide it in you house. There a lot of darknet places that explain some pretty clever hiding spots. If it&#039;s multiple duffle bags full of cash, then finding another solution like an offshore bank account or a legitimate business to launder it through is probably necessary.

				well i must say thank u to all so far. some good ideas here and some well not so. but i should at least make myself clear. <br /><br />10,000.00 + carry around at a time. Like i have gotten those stories that if u walk into an airport they know u have the cash thank kind of thing. I think it has something to do with the metal strips.. Correct any of this if its wrong. I have bought enough metal in my life to fill a few landfills. plus i dont want to own metal when i need cash. COLD HARD cash. lets say the cash pile is in excess of a few mil.&nbsp; scattered in bank boxes all around the us.. in towns and villages but i would want to keep it more in a central location so that would mean getting to these places and actually moving it. I could do by car.. avoid airports totally. and i like the vac pac.. but the best bags that are totally waterproof. and can they withstand xray. I am sorry if i am being very stupid here&nbsp; as for offshore i have that already but once all the shit goes down and i dont own my own plane getting there could have its difficulties.. Plus once i got there who is to say it will be able to be gotten as well. art stones and what not all been liquidated. Not really interested in that either. Still have some choice pieces but.. <br /><br />so really trying to hid it from big government or prying eyes at the bank cant trust any of them but as i said it needs to be close by sooo. I thought&nbsp; of cars scattered about the city with the cash in bags in the panels or blind trunks.. Again can that be scanned when crossing a border. PLUS would have to employ a few good men to keep cars top notch and clean road worthy.. Lots of work for sure.&nbsp;

				Having massive amounts of cash (millions+) seems like a pain in the ass and a really bad idea... simply because if the funds were gained illegally, you&#039;re never going to be able to spend them without getting pinched or at least attracting the wrong kind of attention so whats the point in stockpiling?<br /><br />You need to launder it so you can spend it cleanly, even if it means paying some taxes on it. You need to get connected with the right financial people to turn your piles of illegal cash into piles of clean, legal cash that you can spend as you wish.

				the things i purchase people will not notice. ;) safes in the home does not help as any home invasion by the feds or local they can just scoop it up,&nbsp; haul it away and torch it open. Moving to one central location is best for me and then just let it sit. I like a few of the ideas. I cant have it too close but again it cant be too far. I need to be able to get to it and not have others be able to track it. <br /><br />Can a pile of cash that is in excess of 50k be traced by heat or any other tech METHOD&nbsp; to see how much it is and where it is. and when u cross into a border or even under an easy pass can it trace money stashed in your car????<br /><br />
