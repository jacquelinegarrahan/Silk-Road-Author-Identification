				Is it possible to register a greendot visa gift card (or something along those lines&nbsp; that can be loaded with mp)anonymously then load with moneypaks and cash out at an atm? I am located within the USA and would like to find a way to turn moneypaks to cash anonymously without having to give my name or address. Please do not say exchange them to bitcoins. That is what I am using to buy the moneypaks in the first place. If anyone knows of doing this and has experience in turning moneypaks into cash please post. Thanks for the assistance fellow SR users.

				I&#039;m not a vendor but I look into many things. Prepaid visa cards that can be funded via money pack that can be bought from wal-mart, cvs, etc. have to be registered under a persons info, which reqs a ss # to be activated, among other things. Best bet is take your moneypaks &amp; I know that somehow (because i&#039;ve never personally done it) moneypak can be converted to paypal. So convert MP to PP. Through a bootleg PP account or whatnot. Then goto this guy for anon visa cards that can be funded via PP. These cards can be cashed at ATMs with $3.5K allowed to flow through the card total. So basically every $3.5K you wish to cash will be a $37 fee, plus whatever other fees you may pay. You can make purchases for items with them or slowly cash through ATMs.<br /><br />http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=3572<br /><br />Anyone else, could chime in when they would like, but I would also refer you guys to check the HackBB Forum for further info on these subjects.

				I have a paypal debit card and could send the cash to you through western union. WU charges a $5 fee. Then pp charges a dollar for the atm fee plus whatever the atm fee is which is anywhere&#039;s from 2 to 3 dollars. Plus I am taking a big ass risk so I&#039;d have to come up with a percentage for my share. Does anyone know if paypal reports to the IRS? I had read somewhere that you don&#039;t have to pay taxes on a paypal account.
