				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m attempting to create a vendor account but have no bitcoins. The rules for creating a vendor account state that you cannot have bought anything on the account. However, I need to buy some COIN to create a vendor account.<br /><br />So, since one cannot have bought anything on their vendor account, does one need to buy COIN on a buyer account---&gt; create a new account ---&gt; send coin from buyer account to vendor account ---&gt; create vendor account ???<br /><br />Or, does buying COIN technically qualify as a purchase and I am able to create the vendor account with the account on which I bought the COIN?<br /><br /><br />Or... Am I totally missing the point and there is a totally better way to go about this? Any help is greatly appreciated, if someone would be kind enough to walk me through this in PM, I would be happy to send a few coins your way (money makes shit happen, right?).

If that person has your address, then they can easily blackmail you. If it was a member of LE that you bought from, they now have your address for investigation and prosecution purposes should you choose to sell illegal drugs via the mail service.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you&#039;re quite ready to become a vendor.. There are literally hundreds of ways to buy Bitcoin - you don&#039;t have to buy them on the Silk Road marketplace.&nbsp; ???

				I realize there are many ways to buy coin but assumed that since I am buying them for &quot;industrious&quot; purposes that it would be best to get them from SR. But, I see what you&#039;re saying about the blackmail potential. <br /><br />To get coin deposited to my account, would I essentially purchase them &quot;third party&quot; and send them to the address listed on my account?<br /><br />You say I am not quite ready to become a vendor. I will heed your warning. What do you recommend I do to well equip myself? Feel free to PM me, I WILL find a way to get some bitcoin, and I would be happy to compensate you for quality &quot;consultation&quot;.

				No, sounds smart, and thanks. The guiding principle &quot;One can never be too paranoid&quot; has always served me well :D.

				All these ideas are a huge waste of time..<br /><br />The reason SR does not want you to have buys with your vendor account is because if you had buys then other vendors have your address!!! That is the only reason. <br /><br />It has nothing to do with getting Btc to open your vending account.<br /><br />Though I&nbsp; agree with another poster that you are not ready to be a vendor...it does shock me that you couldn&#039;t figure out why SR says that. Also it is strange that you have not figured out that all you need to do is open another SR buyer account. Then send coins to that account. Then use that account and send with the option of sending Btc to another member your vending account the funds to pay for your vending account.<br /><br />But in truth you don&#039;t even need to do that, the people that posted in here all the things you need to do to &quot;clean&quot; the coins have no idea what they are talking about...Why in the world would it ever matter if you sent the coins into SR. No matter what btc address you use it can&#039;t be linked to your vending account. It basically can&#039;t even be traced to going to SR. And who in the world would be tracing it?<br /><br />People just love to say shit in here when they have NO CLUE. If you are really serious about being a vendor and you have questions..DO NOT ASK THE FORUMS!!! This is a perfect example how bad the answers are in here from people that are not vendors. Just send a vendor a message on Silk road and they will help you.<br /><br />Do not post questions in here and listen to people that have no idea what they are talking about.<br /><br />

				Who said I didn&#039;t understand why SR doesn&#039;t want you selling stuff on your buyer account?<br /><br />I may have been confused as to how to get coin into my account, but I think it&#039;s pretty obvious why you shouldn&#039;t mix seller and buyer transactions...<br /><br />Thanks for the tip, I&#039;ll send out a couple messages and see what happens.
