				I see one poster&nbsp; (ato72543) in particular keeps posting clearnet links and suggesting that people do not open them with Tor. This is Bad Advice. In one case he had a somewhat plausible explanation, in that he linked to a flash video tutorial on using GPG, and flash CAN circumvent Tor. This fails to address the point that NOT USING TOR CIRCUMVENTS TOR IN ALL CASES. Better advice would be &quot;don&#039;t look at flash videos people here post, period&quot;. In other cases he is giving links to .html sites and suggesting that people open them outside of Tor. In this case, there is no plausible explanation for why this would even potentially be considered good advice, and it is pretty obvious that he is confused about how Tor works if he thinks it is not meant for accessing the clearnet with it.

				I don&#039;t understand the point of clearnet warnings. Tor Browser is primarily intended for browsing clearnet.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve enabled Flash or Java, it&#039;s your own fault, and in this case it doesn&#039;t make any difference at all if you visit a .onion site or a clearnet site. A Java applet on a .onion site can easily connect you to a clearnet server to find your IP.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of Flash being able to circumvent Tor. Can you please elaborate? It can be used to fingerprint you but that&#039;s about it.

I was late to realize they were doing so because they didn&#039;t know what they were talking about. <br /><br />--<br /><br />In any case kmfkewm is 100% correct. I would add:<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t google Silk Road or anything Silk Road related on a clearnet browser (your regular chrome or internet exploder or firefox etc).<br />2. Don&#039;t search for anything on a clearnet browser that is also what you&#039;re posting on here.<br /><br />That might sound over the top. But it is easy to detect a Google request that came out of a Tor exit node, and since this is one of the largest hidden service forums you should be wary. Who knows what relationship LE really has with the search engines. LEO break the law all the time and call it &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; or &quot;confidential informant&quot; which it produces results.<br /><br />You are being watched. Constantly. Both software agents trawling posts and real LE agents.

				It isn&#039;t a feature or a bug, it is a design choice that overlooks anonymity. So I suppose it is the lack of a feature, but not a bug.

				Also I suppose it is possible that Gnash or some other flash plugin has the feature of using the proxy settings of the browser, I am not sure which if any do. I just know that flash not respecting browser proxy settings was such a widespread problem at one point that Tor Project officially said that it is not secure to use Flash plugins with browsers configured to use Tor, unless transparent proxying or similar techniques are used to ensure it doesn&#039;t by pass Tor. I have also heard them say that even with such configurations, it is best practice to avoid using flash plugins anyway, as they are likely to be insecure in other ways as well.

				Actually, the solution is pretty simple. Tor devs should pack Gnash (by forking it if necessary) as part of Tor Browser Bundle.
