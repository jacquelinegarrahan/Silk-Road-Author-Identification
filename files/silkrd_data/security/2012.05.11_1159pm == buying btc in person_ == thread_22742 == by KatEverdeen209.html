				I know some people who don&#039;t order them online though it seems it may be safer is there a way to find where in town one might be able to buy some? I asked them but it seems they have found out through word of mouth. So I guess what I&#039;m saying is there a directory or maybe a common type of store where I could look to buy some coin?

				I too have wondered the same thing.&nbsp; In my searches, I found three or so such sites. None of them appeared to be too active. I was thinking about trying to create some type of exchange in major cities such as LA, NYC, and Chicago. What would the legality of such an exchange be? I think a the main problem with past ventures was finding people trying to rid themselves of bitcoins in such a manner. On the other hand, I can see such a system properly done being the best way to truly preserve anonymity.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, are you near any of those three cities I listed?

				If you&#039;re in the UK, there&#039;s a guy here (think he&#039;s called vladimir or something similar) I believe who will do bitcoins for cash in the post. Just pay the £3 or whatever it is for tracked post so you&#039;re 100% certain it won&#039;t get lost/stolen. <br /><br />As for buying in person, I think there are sites where you can arrange that. You should try the bitcoin messageboards/IRC

				If you start opening physical BTC exchanges like they have currency exchanges then i would imagine the government coming in and starting to monitor/regulate btc sales, they will find a way :p

I offer this service for people in the UK/Europe (Please see my link at the bottom of this message for full details)<br /><br />After an unkind comment earlier today however I should point out that this is not the only method to buy BTC in person. A look on your local Craigslist will probably show people with BTC for sale. <br /><br />As far as I can tell the only safe ways to do this would be for both parties to use a mobile app / laptop with internet connection to send / confirm receipt of the coins to an electronic wallet OR for the seller to bring a paper wallet, the private keys of which could be redeemed online by the buyer while the seller waits. Has anyone had personal experience of this? <br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I have seen the map posted by Cpt Meow which is cool, but very sparse. I would really like to see a more well established system, at least for all major cities.

				The map is kind of what I was looking for. Just thought there would be a lot more. Idk how my friend just straight found a place around the corner for him according to that I&#039;d have to take a 10hr or so drive LOL<br />not worth it<br /><br />I kind of figured it would be at a bunch of &quot;we buy gold&quot; places or next to moneypaks at CVS LOL<br /><br />You buy a card which covers a fee like moneypak and boom just load money on to it

				Would it be illegal to act as a middle man so that neither party ever meets the other during the exchange? This also assumes that the middle man is doing this out of the good of his heart for no profit.

				Put out an ad on your local craigslist that says: &quot;will pay cash for your bitcoin in person only&quot;. Then maybe you can save your bit coin address on a flash drive and go to their place. but I&#039;d snoop the area out first before approaching. I don&#039;t know how wise this would be
