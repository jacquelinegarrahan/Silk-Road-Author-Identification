				Does PGP protect you from the cops being able to read what you are typing on the internet as in.. if you don&#039;t PGP what you type.. then the cops are reading it at &#039;&#039;home base&#039;&#039;<br /><br />or<br /><br />is the sole purpose of PGP to protect you from getting your computer confiscated and your address not being typed in...<br />and if it is this one.. what is to say that you didn&#039;t type your address in on ebay? does it show a date and time and web address for when you sent a message over an onion site without pgp?<br />it just doesn&#039;t make sense. I would like to understand how the information that protects me actually works<br /><br />peace

				If you are worried about sending your unencrypted address to vendors on SR, your only fear should be they have left your address printed somewhere or it is otherwise stored, unencrypted, by them. I think when orders show up as in transit to you, the SR system deletes the address for the order que, but not 100% sure. All traffic in TOR is encrypted, end to end. None of the nodes are aware of what is being transmitted, where it came from, or where is ultimately going. They cannot eavesdrop on TOR traffic and read your address in real time, if that&#039;s what you are asking. It really is up to the vendor to run a tight ship to keep your name and info safe. It&#039;s against the rules at SR to save any addresses. <br /><br />I wouldnt worry to much about sending your address unencrypted on SR, though I hate doing it, so I feel ya on it. If the vendor has shitty security or hands over the keys to his SR account to LE, and your order is still in the que, they will read it just as the vendor would. Real-time homebase reading, no.

				PGP let&#039;s you encrypt msgs before they leave your computer, so no servers or MITM or other spying can read what you write. If your computer is seized, they still need your PGP password to decrypt anything they don&#039;t automatically get a free for all to your whole emails unless your password is very weak<br /><br />Also did you just post your number are you crazy? wowolol

				Lol, OP, enjoy your hippy flip. <br /><br />Most people don&#039;t hate me. It seems any government official above meter maid does, though. I&#039;m not a supporter of any war and have never been in the military. I&#039;m just a dude who values freedom(real freedom) and who loves his fellow countrymen, but hates how complacent and blind we have become. Anyway, good luck encrypting thangs!<br /><br /><br />

Absolutely nothing SR does can adequately encrypt the address on the server, it absolutely requires client side encryption for it to be stored on the server encrypted in a way that will make a difference.
