				Has anyone tried this new service yet?<br />You can deposit cash,&nbsp; and have Bitcoins sent to your email address in less than an hour.<br />They are using coinapult.com to send the bitcoins.<br />You don&#039;t need to use a Bitcoin exchange or show any ID at all.<br /><br />www.bitinstant.com<br /><br />It is currently only available in the USA,&nbsp; but I hear that lots more countries are coming soon.

				the coins aren&#039;t sent to your email address<br />a coupon code for a btc exchange (e.g mt gox, dwolla, et al) is sent to your email<br /><br />you take the coupon code and put it into your exchange and they credit you the amount minus the 3.99% or whatever bitinstant takes<br /><br />The service works very well. I&#039;ve made cash deposits 4 times and each time the coupon code was in my email box by the time I was back at home

				yes they finally offered instant bitcoins at bitinstant lol. problem is they apparently do not have a currency exchanging license, only a money moving license, and at anytime the excited states of secret service money terrorists can come after them now like they did the liberty reserve and egold exchangers of yore. use it before its gone
