				I know its &quot;safer&quot; to DIRECTLY transfer coins to SR via blue sky traders, but how many people do a direct deposit from bitinstant to their SR wallet?<br /><br />What i mean is when you go to bitinstant, you put in you SR wallet instead of blockchain wallet for instance...

				i rarely bother using an offline wallet as a tumble option, i just go from the coin provider to my sr wallet, then after i&#039;ve finished shopping, deposit the leftovers to an offline wallet.<br /><br />i&#039;ve saved up about $150 so far doing that, just from leftover coins :) sweet! it&#039;s like your own bank account minus the lousy monthly fees (unless of course the bitcoin decides to take a dive)<br /><br />i do change my sr wallet address after each deposit though, so each coin provider transaction is being sent to a new/different address.

				somewhat related question that I haven&#039;t found the answer to elsewhere--<br /><br />anyone know if the built in SR tumbler randomizes transactions between SR accounts?<br /><br />or does it only tumble them when you submit a payment?

				yes treebeard, besides your coins being tumbled when you deposit, the transactions are also randomized, to answer your question. but it never hurts to tumble the coins as much as you want. i deposit straight to SR because i believe in their system.

I guess it makes more sense to say once you buy btc and once it gets deposited and spent, its been tumbled enough times not to be able to get traced back to POS.

				I&#039;m new to SR, but I&#039;ve changed my address twice, switching it each time I deposit with BitInstant, and using BitInstant to deposit directly into the new address.&nbsp; I have accounts now with Dwolla and Mt. Gox, so&nbsp; I could do it that way, but it&#039;s so much faster just to pay the fee and have the funds show up in a few hours instead of a few days.

				<br />you can test this theory of tumbling from account to account by creating a dummy account.<br />the &quot;withdraw&quot; your coins to the new &quot;dummy&quot; account address.<br />then check the blockchain, follow the trail and see ( or do taint analysis ).<br /><br />I have tried this method for &quot;free&quot; tumbling 3 or 4 times. mostly, it seems to work . Except this one time when the 2BTC got transferred AS IS, in full from one address ( main account ) to the other (dummy account ).<br /><br />when one withdraws the coins to an address outside the SR system, the ALWAYS get tumbled. Within SR, this does not seem to be the case ( at least not consistently enough ).<br />I have checked this on the blockchain on at least 5 - 6 occassions.

				I normally rave about bitinstant, but they really let me down today.&nbsp; I put about $90 in, and got verification emails from zipzap, but not bitinstant.&nbsp; When I got home and checked blockchain, nothing, so I chatted with bitinfo.&nbsp; They said they were having &quot;technical problems&quot; and mine would have to be done as a manual transfer.&nbsp; For that, I would have to wait one business day.&nbsp; I told them that the processing speed was the whole reason I used bitinstant, and for the wait I should at least have my fee refunded.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t agree.&nbsp;

				Again, if its just for personal, just have your coins thrown directly into your SR account.<br />I have been it for over 2 months and no problem.<br /><br />Just change your SR addy once a month and your shining.
