				Hey all, I&#039;m very, very new to SR but I&#039;m looking forward to getting involved!<br />I live in the UK and don&#039;t really have the option to set up a p. o. box,<br />what would you recommend as the best course of action for accepting deliveries at home? (using a friend&#039;s, etc.)<br />...and, if you could, what is the general procedure that the federales will follow should they suspect something is amiss?<br /><br />More simply: what do? :P

				We have customs, police, security services but no feds!<br /><br />Best way to get delivery is first to see if your address has any previous tenants.<br /><br />Secondly, your name to a trusted neighbors address. (if neighbors are good they will post it. Make sure it is clean law abiding flag saluting neighbors not ones with a ton of shit lying around)<br /><br />There are tons of mail drops. Yellow page it. Search online. Use Tor always for drug searches as UK laws mean ALL email, phone calls, texts and internet habits are logged and can or will be used as evidence on a wide broad section of society.<br /><br />Friends who do not do drugs and whose parents do not do drugs is cool. NEVER send without knowing if he occupants turn on. Many parents will fly under radar with drugs. Friends parents may be snorting coke when the house is clear. <br /><br />Also - there are other ways to get a mail drop. Empty houses. I even know people who have squatted a house for a day or two. <br /><br />Send that mail to somewhere clean.<br /><br />Maybe carousel deliveries between buddies. That way its safe as can be. One address may get flagged. That means the local PO has cops monitoring deliveries. Worse are customs! They have more rights and more possibilities. Cops or customs they are not stupid so never dismiss them. As a small buyer in the UK you are fairly safe. But SR is news here and some politicians want it sorted. Cops take orders and there are enough tech savvy and drug savvy cops out there. They are people just like you. Some raised int he hood or trailer parks, savvy and sharp. Drug squads used to be actually drug users with badges. Corruption is widespread. But there are honest cops who I respect. Mos drug dealers in RL are pretty much not nice people. Its a jungle out there and even dealing weed its guns and baseball bats as &#039;resolution&#039;.<br /><br />I prefer SR. Keep it safe and you can get a nice stash in once you are assured that this is not a scam!<br /><br />Good place, some dealers may be assholes but they have to deal here and quality is the only way to keep on here.<br /><br />Good luck.
