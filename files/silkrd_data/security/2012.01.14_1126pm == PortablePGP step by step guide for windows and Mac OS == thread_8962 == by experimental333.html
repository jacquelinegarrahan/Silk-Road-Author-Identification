				I wrote this guide for one of the SR users, and thought I would share it here.<br />I prefer to use PortablePGP because it&#039;s better suited for SR than email software with built in PGP encryption.<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br />Download portable PGP http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/<br />Unpack the archive<br /><br />start pgpportable.exe<br />click the &quot;generate new pair key&quot; icon on the top<br />name: enter your SR username<br />email: just type nothing@nothing.com or whatever you want, don;t use your real email adress!<br />passphrase: enter your password YOU WILL USE IT TO DECRYPT YOUR MESSAGES<br />again: confirm the password<br />click generate<br />wait a few sec<br />now you have your pair of keys, you can decrypt and encrypt messages.<br /><br />HOW TO ENCRYPT A MESSAGE:<br />You need the recipients public key. usually you can find it in his profile, if not ask for it.<br /><br />1 Copy the public key of the sender to notepad, save the file.<br />2 Click the icon with an arrow &quot;import from a file&quot;, next to &quot;public keys&quot;<br />find the txt file you just saved, open it.<br />3 Click &quot;Encrypt&quot; button on the left<br />4 Enter the message<br />5 choose the recipient from &quot;target&quot; dropdown list<br />6 Click encrypt BELOW<br /><br />Now you have the encrypted message. copy it and paste and send it.<br />MAKE SURE TO PASTE YOUR PUBLIC KEY, SO THE RECIPIENT CAN ENCRYPT A MESSAGE FOR YOU<br /><br />HOW TO DECRYPT A MESSAGE<br />1 Copy the encoded message<br />2 Click &quot;Decrypt&quot; button on the left<br />2 Paste the message<br />4 Click Decrypt<br />5 Enter your password<br />6 Read the message :)<br /><br />installation under Mac OS:<br />Since portablepgp is written in java, it can also be started on MacOS, you just need a launcher. It&#039;s just a command that executes portablepgp java file under mac os.<br />1 Download portablepgp create a folder called PortablePGP in your documents folder, put the portablepgp files there.<br />2 Go to http://www.instantcrypt.com/InstantCrypt_CompatiblePrograms_LinuxApple.php and download th launcher (green button halfway in the page).<br /><br />Extract the launcher files to your PortablePGP folder. <br />Start &quot;Start_PortablePGP_OSX.terminal&quot;<br />Now you should be running portablepgp under mac os!<br /><br />If you need more help, just reply here and I&#039;ll help you out.<br /><br /><br />

				So close! I followed all the instructions and I&#039;m almost there. The trouble is, when I get to the part where you double click on &quot;Start_PortablePGP_OSX.terminal,&quot; I see the terminal window open up for just a brief moment then it closes back down again and the program won&#039;t run. I have no idea what that is about. Any ideas? This is the second PGP program I&#039;m trying and I can&#039;t seem to get either one to work. The first one I installed was GPG tools or something. I managed to create a public and private key using that one but I have no idea how to import someone&#039;s public key and use that to encrypt/decrpyt a msg. Can you tell me the exact steps to import someone&#039;s public key and use it to send/receive msgs? I&#039;m no computer whiz AT ALL so I&#039;ll need very basic step by step instructions. Thanks man. I know us noobs are a pain but I&#039;ll pay it forward!

				I&#039;m a noob here, just trying to figure everything out so I can properly encrypt, so I got pgp for mac os and followed the steps to get the launcher, but when I open the terminal, the window for the terminal opens fine, but there is no pop up or nothing that gives me any sort of options to &quot;generate new pair key&quot; or anything like that, what am I missing? thank you.

				O.k., So I type a message, I get a PGP encrypted message which i sent by mail to the recipient. <br /><br />The recipient opens it using his key I guess... <br /><br />Now i&#039;m lost for the part: &quot;MAKE SURE TO PASTE YOUR PUBLIC KEY&quot;... <br />I dont have a public key and I cant see how to make 1 in portable PGP. I tried to open the message I created myself (for recipient) but got the error &quot;cannot extract a suitable private key...&quot; (although used my key which i entered before in the Elgamal Key Pair)<br /><br />So I can make a encrypted message but am stuck on the part of decrypting... <br /><br />

				There&#039;s a good window&#039;s front-end called GPG4Win if people are struggling and want FAST.<br /><br />Specifically the program Kleopatra in the package, with which you can import the other person&#039;s public key, encrypt and decrypt by simply copying the relevant text to the clipboard (highlight it all, CTRL-A, then copy CTRL-C) right click the icon in the taskbar and choosing Clipboard.

				Hi there,<br /><br />Mac user here and everything is working fine! thanks for the info!<br /><br />Just a little confused, when i encrypt a message to send to SR vendor do i select the vendor under the &#039;target&#039; dropdown menu and then under the &#039;sign&#039; dropdown menu do i choose &quot;No signature, just encrypt&quot; OR &quot;myself &#039;myself@myself.myself&#039;&quot;?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />anon

I tried to open the message I created myself (for recipient) but got the error &quot;cannot extract a suitable private key...&quot; (although used my key which i entered before in the Elgamal Key Pair)<br /><br />So I can make a encrypted message but am stuck on the part of decrypting...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />The way you do this is to send yourself a msg.&nbsp; Click the &quot;Encrypt&quot; bar and drag down yourself as the recipent. When the notepad opens you have your public key.&nbsp; Hope this helps!!
