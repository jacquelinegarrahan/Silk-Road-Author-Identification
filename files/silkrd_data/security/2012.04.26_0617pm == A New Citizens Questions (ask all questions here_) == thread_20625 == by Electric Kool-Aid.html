				First of all I would just like to say hey and say that I apriciate how the sense of community on this site. As being new to the SR I have a few questions and could not find a “Newbies ask all questions here” forum(might be something to add so there is not a lot of redundant forums). Anyways before people start saying use the search function, I did and could not find a diffinative answear. Also, read the whole wiki and came away with conflicting answears. Anyways into the questions:<br /><br />1) With Midori having DNS leak and not being able to install tor browser bundle unless you go into the kernal is TAILS safe? Just for purchasing?<br /><br />2) Shipping: I know a lot has been said on this subject as it contains almost all the risks, but as it has the most risks I want to make sure I know. Real name, Real name with slight error, or fake name?(have seen conflicting info) Home adress, Neighbors adress with your name, PO Box(no fake id)? Where to buy from other than domestic? Germany? Canada? India? Spain? Any to watch out for other than NL? <br /><br />3) Cash for Bit Coin? How safe is this? Any repuatble people doing this transaction? Any outside companies? Do not want to make a bank transfer to a company.<br /><br />4) Products and their ability/chances of being detected: DMT? LSD? AMT? Shrooms/Shroom Chocolate? MDMA? K? Bud? Hash? Herion? Coke?( I presume LSD would be safest although I read heat degrades the LSD is this a problem when shipping ie containers are not temp controlled? LSD safe fromNL? Bud to be the easiest to detect due to smell/size of large quantities)<br /><br />5) Other than checking completed transaction and the rumor mill any other ways to check out who/whom is a good vendor? Also, being new should I buy five “low cost” items so I can use the escrow function or just communicate with vendor?<br /><br />Thank you, I know that is a lot to answear and Im hoping someone does answear. If I have any more questions I will post them here as I encourage all new people to now add to this and possibly make it the newbie ask questions forum. Thanks again to all those that try and help clear away my haze.<br /><br />PS posted this in security as I think that is where it belongs but if Off topic pealse feel free to move.
