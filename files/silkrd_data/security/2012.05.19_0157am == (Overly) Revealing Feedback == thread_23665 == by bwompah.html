				I was just browsing on SR and noticed someone put a little too much detail about a vendor&#039;s packaging in their feedback. Is there anyone who monitors stuff like this? Should I message the vendor or SR Support to let them know or should I just mind my own damn business and assume it&#039;s not a big deal? It wasn&#039;t a completely terrible misstep and it probably wouldn&#039;t even matter to some people, but I&#039;m in favor of keeping shipping methods as secretive as possible, so if I was the vendor in question, I&#039;d be a little irritated.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I saw something about shipping packaging too that seemed to reveal too much. <br />I think contacting the Admins is a good idea.

				Quote the guy in the original thread and write what you wrote here. If hes a decent guy/girl he will realize he made a mistake and edit his post. If he doesnt get the clue notify admin.

				I guess I am slightly guilty of this but not overly I wouldn&#039;t have thought. I scored the transaction as a 5 (as always if it arrives perfectly) but merely remarked that the address had been handwritten - I mean surely as a rule of thumb, from as far as I can tellfrom reading the forums here, is that not quite a big no no?<br /><br />Didn&#039;t think in terms of the actual packaging method used it was too revealing because think how many handwritten addresses there are going through the postal system?! Not exactly a standout feature.<br /><br />Needless to say I saw someone else had commented about my feedback have a little go at it so went back and amended the feedback.

				I might consider revealing details of a particularly awful packaging. Instead of keeping it secret and protecting a bad and dangerous (for the buyer) packaging method, i&#039;d rather talk (as a last resort publicly) about it, hoping&nbsp; that particular method gets abandoned.

				On a similar note does it bother anyone else when it looks as though someone is having an orgasm over the stealth level of packaging?&nbsp; Just feel it may draw extra attention to the vendor from LE?&nbsp; Maybe a moot point and just paranoia but I like to keep things as discreet as possible.

				Hello, I am a vendor and yeah people seem to like my packaging and one time someone was too specific and it does hurt security. I try to keep in mind that LE could be ordering from me at any time.&nbsp; So I have to redesign packaging at some interval of time anyway. It was positive feedback, so I don&#039;t want to hate on the person that left it.. but yeah it would be nice if that stuff got filtered out.

				There is a feedback thread here that describes in detail the packaging method used, including information on the type of envelope and its (phoney) contents, in this case &quot;documents&quot;.<br /><br />Switch on, people. Think about what it is you are saying.<br /><br />:)
