				Hello ladies and gentlemen,<br />I am new to this whole thing but I am extremely interested. By no means am I a rich person but I do have a job that I love and a family to support. That is why i want to do this stuff the right way, the secure way. I need to know how to set up my computer and accounts from the from the ground up. Everything from buying a new computer, to encrypting that computer, and everything else that goes along with that... I know alot of these answers are on the forums but I don&#039;t know where to start. The last thing I want to do is buy something and have some kind of digital signature that traces it back to me. Thanks to all.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;If you wait till the last minute, it only takes a minute.&quot;

				there are so many ways and it all depends on what someone is comfortable with <br /><br />Id start with reading about BTC and learning about that first, there are some guides here in the site and the search button is a serious friend for any answer, i know that some of the people who have been here for a long time a reluctant to give information and rightfully so <br /><br />this all takes time to get good at and all the information is in front of you just have to look, people arent going to just flat out silver plate list it for you <br /><br />but If you are just looking to make a small purchase id say go with moneypak --&gt; btc from one of the vendors on the site and then learn how to use PGP encryption for your address voila! you can get high :) <br /><br />if you have significant others tho obviously it&#039;d be better to have a PO box or somewhere different to get your mail unless your situation allows it <br /><br />just use your head thats all it takes really there are so many threads of people asking for people to just list shit for them it gets redundant, search function!!!

				1: never sign for any package. <br />2. never talk to the cops/ use your right to remain silent and ask for a layer/ never take a deal without a laywer they will lie to you.<br />3. use truecrypt to encrypt your computers(look it up on youtube/web) <br />3.put tails or liberte on a usb drive (i use tails because i cant seem to get liberte to work for me)<br />4.ill assume your using tails.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;once installed on the usb by following steps on the web (google it) boot it by pressing f12 or esc (what ever button it says on your computer to boot) then selecting your usb.<br />5. on the language page hit tab then type truecrypt <br />6. once loaded look for truecrypt and create a container or hidden container (look it up on google)<br />7. download gpg4usb<br />8. right click the start linux file go to permissions and click allow executable or something like that.<br />9. generate a key with a tormail email adress (goto tormail.net in tails and then click the link to go to tor mail sign up and use that email for everything silk road<br />10. once gpg4usb is setup put it in the truecrypt container dismount <br />11. put the file you turned into a container onto a online storage site like mydisk.net thats based in switerland<br />12. now you just download gpg4usb anytime you need to encrypt a meessge like when making a purchase.<br />13. so now make sure you delect everything silk road related on any computer with wiping software like shreader (download.com i think its free) use the erase free space feature to. a one pass should do it fine but you can do more if you like but it will take a long time.<br />14. nothing is on your computer and nothing is on your usb because tails delects everything when you done so if you do everything on the web silk road tormail and then just download your gpg4usb when needed wipe it from tails when your done. there should be nothing on your system.<br />15. if you want more protection you should connect to a unprotected network or hack into one that has wep. theres a good video on youtube if you want me to post it just write down every step and it wont seem so hard

				Read everything carefully and do nothing stupid. <br />Don´t buy from other tor sites than on Sr.<br />Your first 10 orders make with one of the top seller.<br /><br />Asking at Sr forum was a good idea if you need something you find it here.<br /><br />If you need btc quick buy them on Sr! It is a little bit expensive, but you don´t need to wait not so much risk and no sepa transfer!<br /><br />Good luck with Sr..<br /><br />

				Buying with ukash or psc on Sr is completely anonymous.<br /><br />Buying bitcoins per sepa<br />After your money transfer your btc pocket no one is interested where your money <br />is going if it is not so much.

				Buying bitcoins is legal...so many people are so scared everyone must think btc are going to drugs.<br /><br />Btc is a market that if you invest money in you can make some good money.<br /><br />Paranoia is a BIG DESTROYER!

				P Bucket, I think your right. Im going to set everything up this week and give it a try. <br />Random question. If I have a package sent to a friends house, and he doesnt know about it, could he get in trouble for signing for it?

				So what I&#039;m gathering is that if your ordering a small quantity of substance that could be mailed in a regular envalope , you dont have to sign for it. That would be like recieving a regular letter in the mail. What about like a g of weed. Do venders usually send in packages or in envalopes that you wouldnt have to sign for?

				It&#039;s considered bad etiquette to post specifics about buyers packaging. However, unless you have a mail box the width of a piece of card you should be ok, Most packages will fit through a standard letter box.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn&#039;t ship it to a friend&#039;s address. If you receive a lot of mail at your current address then it should just blend in. If, however, you send it to a random, empty house that only receives circulars and catalogues and then suddenly there&#039;s a &#039;normal&#039; package it&#039;d be a pretty easy reach for the powers that be to think it was suspect. Just use your head and you&#039;ll be fine :)
