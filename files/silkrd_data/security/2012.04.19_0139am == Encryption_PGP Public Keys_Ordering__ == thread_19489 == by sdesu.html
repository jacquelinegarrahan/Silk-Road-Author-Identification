				Hi all, <br />I&#039;m really sorry for posting so many threads, but I&#039;m literally clueless of how all of this works. My question is simple: What the hell do I do with someone&#039;s PGP Public Key Block? I&#039;ve tried to follow the instructions in the &quot;Complete all-in-one guide On how to anonymously use Silk Road&quot; thread, but I am still lost. I&#039;m wanting to buy something, obviously, but I know I need to encrypt all sensitive info. My questions are few, but chronological, so it should hopefully make it easier for both parties :)<br /><br />Q. What the hell do I do with someone&#039;s PGP Public Key Block?<br />Q. How do I use the above to add my information, encrypt it, and give it back to them on the order form?<br /><br />Thanks again everyone for being so incredibly helpful to a newbie,<br /><br />- sdesu<br /><br />

				import their key into your gpg client. then type your info into a text file, and save it as message.txt. then open your gpg client, and encrypt that test file. select their key to use for encryption. make sure you use ascii armor. then, open the resulting file (messsage.txt.asc) copy the cipher, and paste it to your message/address field. Then send wretched all your left over BTC for helping your out...lol

				Maybe a little more info. <br /><br />Copy the entire user&#039;s key including the &quot;------begin pgp&quot; all the way to the &quot;------end pgp&quot; and save it somewhere on your computer as a text file suing notepad or something. Then using your pgp program import the test file you saved and it should import. You then can send that user a message by encrypting and selecting their personal key to encrypt with. That will allow only the holder of the corresponding private key to read your mail.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best of luck.

Got the first part down. However, I was previously able to encrypt files using GPG (Right click file&gt; GPG:Encrypt) but now it takes like 6 minutes to do anything, and it just says that it&#039;s unable to encrypt the file because the application isn&#039;t responding to the requested action. The application is up to date. I&#039;m using a mac with Vidalia for my tor connection, and GPG Keychain Access.
