				So I recently heard about Silk and subsequently Tor... I was wanting to know a little bit more about how Tor works... Everything seems secure and the Silk guys seem to be taking every precaution they can to keep anonymity, for the site, it&#039;s customers and it&#039;s sellers... I&#039;ve been very careful, using Tor, false email addresses, usernames and passwords not associated with me at all... I am hesitant to make a purchase straight away without expanding my knowledge on how this all works... I just want to make sure I&#039;m safe and that nothing can be traced back to me... I&#039;m particularly interested in purchasing blotters and have checked out the reputable LSD vendors list... Any help or reassurance you guys can offer will be greatly appreciated... I hope to one day be a regular customer...<br /><br />Thanks :)<br />Onion

				The least secure part of a SR transaction is giving your address to the seller. This is why (almost) all sellers use PGP encryption - so even if SR itself was hacked, your address can still only be seen by the seller. There are a number of guides here (with pictures) to using PGP. The software is not user-friendly, but if you follow the guides exactly you&#039;ll be fine.

				Yeah, that is one aspect that concerned me... I was going to get it delivered to a different address for security reasons, I&#039;m sure a friend would be ok with that... Blotters should be relatively easy to conceal, when compared to things like grass, as they tend to lack a strong smell and resemble stamps... I&#039;ll look into PGP encryption just to be extra confident... Cheers :D

				Thanks - most sellers require use of PGP or they won&#039;t ship. Some accept privnote.com, but PGP is the gold standard here. <br /><br />Blotters should be easy to ship. Weed is probably the hardest to ship bc it&#039;s relatively bulky and has a strong distinctive smell.

				Small amounts of weed, particularly domestic shouldn&#039;t be a huge issue. In my experience buying weed on SR it&#039;s usually flattened thinly and then triple vacuum sealed. Of course a dog will still be able to smell it but any postal worker or customs agent would be oblivious otherwise.
