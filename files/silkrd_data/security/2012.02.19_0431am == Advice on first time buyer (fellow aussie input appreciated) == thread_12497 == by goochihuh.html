				Ok going to get some bitcoin this week from Australia is http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/ the best site to get it?<br />Say I want to buy something for $150 do I deposit like a extra $20 incase the bitcoin place charges me extra?<br />There is some sort of code you put in when you send the seller your address what is that exactly?<br />How long to when you send the bitcoins in the checkout to the seller does it appear in there bitcoin wallet?<br />Should I use a fake reference name for the bit coin deposit?<br /><br />Cheers guys.

				That seems like a reasonable way to buy BTC in Australia.&nbsp; The exchange rate is a little steep, but on the flipside you just walk into your local NAB and hand over the cash, no need for ID.&nbsp; If you use other options you might get a better exchange rate, but the larger exchanges usually demand that you provide identification, or that your money is deposited from a real bank account, etc. <br /><br />It says on their website they won&#039;t charge you extra, I assume the fees are just absorbed into the extra 10% they&#039;re taking on the exchange, so you won&#039;t need to put in extra cash for that, but keep in mind that the value of bitcoins fluctuates (like any currency), so if you&#039;re looking at something today for 50 BTC, it might be more or less expensive when you&#039;re ready to buy. <br /><br /><br />As for your other questions, it&#039;s probably pretty important that you read up on these things before you start throwing your money around.&nbsp; Best to have the security fundamentals in check so you know what the risks are and how you can best minimise them. <br /><br />Good luck.

				Bought all my btc through Jeremy (spendbitcoins), had no hassles and if you want annonymity its the way with the LEAST amount of paper trail! And IMO that&#039;s what&#039;ll get you busted, the paper trail!

				i should add if i go from spendbitcoins to sealswithclubs to SR i take SWC doesnt take a cut for the transfer?<br /><br />I have just noticed Bitpiggy does AUD with bank transfer too and has better rates than spendbitcoins.<br /><br />last of all is doing the SWC extra transfer really neccessary when 1 click and have a new SR address? I thought BTC was supposed to be intraceable.

				Sorry to attach this onto your thread, but i&#039;m wary of starting what must be something that gets done ALL the time and riling people up. What would be the best way of getting bitcoins into SR in the UK? I tried using mt.gox, but it locked me out for &quot;bad ip requests&quot;, presumably because i&#039;m using tor. Is it standard procedure to buy Btcoins on the openweb, then transfer them through a few intermediary wallets like sealswithclubs, before depositing them into SR? Or is it important to make sure that ALL the bitcoin buying is done using tor?

Try and see if there&#039;s any UK brokers offering the same!<br />I won&#039;t use Mt Gox, you basically need to give &#039;em all your details, its a KYC form or some shit...
