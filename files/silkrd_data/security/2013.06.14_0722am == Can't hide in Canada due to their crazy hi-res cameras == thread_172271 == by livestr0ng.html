				http://www.gigapixel.com/image/gigapan-canucks-g7.html<br /><br />&quot;BEFORE THE RIOT version 1 - The Vancouver Canucks Fan Zone along Georgia St. for Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Final was captured at 5:46 pm on June 15, 2011. It is made up of 216 photos (12 across by 18 down) stitched together, taken over a 15-minute span, and is not supposed to represent a single moment in time. The final hi-res file is 69,394 X 30,420 pixels or 2,110 megapixels. Special thanks to Bonita Howard and CBC Real Estate.<br /><br />Canucks Fans: TURN ON GigaTag. Find yourselves and your friends in the Game 7 crowd, then tag and share on Facebook! Tell all your friends!<br /><br />http://www.gigapixel.com/image/gigapan-canucks-g7.html <br />&nbsp;<br />See for yourself:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Place your cursor in the middle of the crowd pictured at the above site.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then left-double-click a couple of times. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will continue to magnify the faces until you can see facial details of anyone in the crowd.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR ... On my Mac, I use the scroll feature on my Mac mouse to zoom-in as far as I want [no double-click needed]. <br />&nbsp;<br />According to the email I received, these cameras are not sold to the public and are being installed in strategic locations (this is in Canada).<br />&nbsp;<br />Imagine what this means...&nbsp; The original email I received said that US Police and Army have it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Any more info? Are you scared? Talk to me.../b.&quot;<br /><br />Note: I didn&#039;t type any of that. I tried the URL that was in there and its amazing what they/it can do. In an aerial view of a crowd of thousands, you can zoom and see anybody with great clarity.

				oh and the US and the UK have had cameras in public places for years. I&#039;ve heard that the UK has the most densely placed cctv system like ever. Not to mention the drones flying over us constantly in the US. It&#039;s safe to just assume you&#039;re on camera. This is what our world has come to. Everyone tracked all the time. Until they get the go ahead with putting chips in us, this is how they will monitor us.

				the idea with these cameras is they can get clear shots of people to run through their mugshot database to try to get a quick id.&nbsp; The ultimate intention is to be able to use things like driver&#039;s licence and passport photos too but the biggest problem with it is that biometrics still hasn&#039;t cracked the problem of fringes and glasses (and possibly beards) - which stop a match.&nbsp; They are working on it and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they finally crack it over the next few years (if they haven&#039;t already).

				This is the world we live in now. It&#039;s been this way for quite a while, actually. There&#039;s a camera on every main street block in the US. Just look up at the street lights, you&#039;ll see them.

				Nothing like the cameras on satellites or aircraft.&nbsp; They use shitloads of cameras that all work together just like that.&nbsp; Just much much much much higher resolution.

				They don&#039;t have these high res cam&#039;s everywhere.. They would only be located in very busy areas. <br /><br />We have no camera&#039;s here compared to the UK.
