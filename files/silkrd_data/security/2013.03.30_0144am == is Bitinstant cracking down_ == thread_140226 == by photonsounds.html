			<dd class="postbody">
				Just curious as to whether anyone here knows the mods/admins over at bitinstant and whether they&#039;ve been under pressure to crack down? I know they post on reddit somewhere, but I stay away from those parts of the internet, mostly.<br /><br />Today I noticed things have changed up a bit. I haven&#039;t put money on SR for over a month. But the option to coinapult to email is no longer there...That was my strongest point for anonymity. An extra mechanism to protect my identity. Use a throwaway email[on proxy], send it to a throwaway blockchain.info wallet [on proxy,] fog it on it&#039;s way to SR [obviously on tor.] Well now my real identity could be tied to the blockchain wallet, which, although fogged, still was sent to an SR address.<br /><br />Now, I understand I might be overreacting a bit. Maybe there&#039;s nothing wrong here? Can someone explain to me how the SR bitcoin addresses work? Like, do they only have a set amount? I click to get a new address after each time I send coins. Is the previous address reused by someone else or lost forever? Can someone [like the Feds] analyze the bitcoin transactions and associate the used address to SR?<br /><br />Bitinstant was so easy too. I hope it&#039;s not compromised :/<br />

				Bitcopia worked really good for me requiring no personal imfo considering you have a Wells Fargo bank nearby. I&#039;m a newbie. Couldn&#039;t get bitinstant or any of the others I tried to work.

				We say a few time here that Bitinstant had been visited by the Feds awhile ago and agreed to do things for them to stay out of trouble etc.<br /><br />Others have posted also. Look at when they had several day downtime, then when came back all new tx limits and new rules, figure out yourself if not believe what others posted. We get fanboy attack when try to keep other safe.<br /><br />Be safe.

				People still use bitinstant? Quickest I find to get coins is Bitfloor, a tad more expensive because of the people who play market...Bitstamp I find is lovely if you can get cash in the account, easy to play the market to get coins, very cheap at certain times of the hour.<br /><br />Lately it&#039;s been easier just to find your favorite vendor and cash him out on coins.. 50/50 on wu mg fee&#039;s it&#039;s a win/win situation.

				I think all Bitcoin exchanges and related services are under more pressure and scrutiny to comply with AML laws these days.&nbsp; I do miss the coins to email feature.&nbsp; I noticed the other day that CVS requires IDs for MoneyGram transactions, while Wal-Mart still does not to my knowledge.&nbsp; Is this a recent change?

				I use Bitinstant. Just use fake info, go to Wal Mart where they don&#039;t ask for ID, pay with cash. Never had an issue and the coins are there within the hour. I also deposit straight to SR account. I really don&#039;t see how a Bitinstant &quot;Crackdown&quot; could cause any real trouble with all the anonymity, and plus the necessary work for an investigation would be wasteful for us who only make small occasional order.
