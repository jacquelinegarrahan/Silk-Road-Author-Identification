They mostly hit our competitors, anything we lose is more than compensated by that. They do seem to enjoy it though, so that&#039;s something.<br /><br />The darknet markets are really made stronger by such activities. More vendors screw their faces up and up their game by becoming expert reverse package profile engineers. <br /><br />By iron, iron itself is sharpened.

				I&#039;m all for OTC, clearly the other methods are going to pop up then get squeezed out regularly. It also has the benefit of being anonymous.<br /><br />However, if someone uses ping-it and blockchain, then another tumbler like bigcoinfog, how is that not anonymous?<br /><br />How is anyone going to track you through blockchain (which has an inbuilt mixer and a taint analysis tool) and then on to bigcoinfog, again mixing it all up and paying out in several transactions over x hours, how is anyone ever going to be able to track that?<br /><br />Blockchain and bitcoinfog would have to be compromised at the same time, which seems less likely than getting ripped off or running in to trouble via an OTC transaction. In fact with OTC you can clearly be seen on bank cameras if you deposit cash directly. You could wear a disguise, but then the disguise is in your house, and you&#039;d have to bin it and get a new one every time. <br /><br />I&#039;m not actually arguing, just playing devils advocate to get peoples thoughts

				Buying BTC isn&#039;t illegal, however revealing your identity when doing it for me isn&#039;t advisable.&nbsp; The chances of you making a cash deposit in&nbsp; branch of a bank and being identified in the future is much lower.&nbsp; After receiving your coins they will be sufficiently mixed.&nbsp; For small time purchases, there are MUCH bigger problems around for investigative authorities.&nbsp; Switch up which banks you go to and don&#039;t wear a disguise.&nbsp; This would probably attract much more attentiion to yourself if spotted.
