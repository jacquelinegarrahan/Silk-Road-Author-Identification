			<dd class="postbody">
				so with the tormail situation, this has left a huge hole...what can we use for email?<br /><br />i know some other alternatives i&#039;ve heard about over the last bit are safemail and lavabit but i&#039;m curious as to other people&#039;s opinions on these 2 providers or if there are any others that would be better.<br /><br />i do know that with lavabit, you would need tor + proxy, as it seems to block TOR ip&#039;s, but i have read that this was the provider snowden used, which must mean there is something useful about it.

				I&#039;ve been trying to get an educated answer to this as well seeing as all tormail bridges are now burned. Ive seen the list of suggestions on the other thread astor has pointed out but I&#039;d love to know what people are actually using... a tried &amp; tested tor friendly email provider, preferably free? <br /><br />The tech talk goes over my head in that thread a bit, although i have done all i can to protect myself with regard to anonymity &amp; research so far on the road, i am now at a brick wall when it comes to finding a semi-anonymous provider. This is the last hurdle before i feel as safe as i can in actually going ahead &amp; buying something.<br /><br />please help, my brain hurts

				so after reading around some more one suggestion is https://www.vmail.me/en, but this needs java enabled to work properly. <br /><br />Should I enable java in order to use this email provider? <br /><br />Just need a new email to register on localbitcoins &amp; blockchain etc. really.<br /><br />Am also wondering why there are not ALOT of other people asking these questions right now seeing as ALOT of people will be needing an alternative email provider in light of recent events, am I missing something?

				hmm, looks like countermail isn&#039;t free<br /><br />it&#039;s turning into a bit of a headache finding a new email provider right now. Think im gonna have to go with safe-mail.net as it&#039;s the only one i can find that&#039;s free and doesn&#039;t require javascript

				shit, after searching around for threads on safe-mail all i hear is bad things. I really don&#039;t know what to do &amp; have hit a big fat brick wall.<br /><br />does anyone have any information on an email provider that has the following:<br /><br />Free sign up<br />Tor friendly<br />Does not need javascript<br /><br />I am, or want to be, a buyer &amp; need the email for registration on localbitcoins. Without this last link in the chain I can&#039;t go ahead any further, as far as I can tell anyway.<br /><br />would really appreciate some advice!

If you encrypt all your sensitive info (as you always have to do) and delete messages from the server ASAP then safe-mail will be fine.<br /><br />The positive of safe-mail is that you don&#039;t need any javascript both to register and check mails and it works without issues with TOR. I use it myself atm until a better option comes out.

The email header will have your Tor IP addy. <br /><br />If you&#039;re even more paranoid, use a VPN which you tunnel Tor traffic to.&nbsp;

				Turns out Tormail was no safer from LE than safe-mail.net.<br /><br />This is why I&#039;ve always argued it doesn&#039;t matter which clearnet email provider you use, as long as you encrypt every email.<br /><br />They can still get metadata about who you communicated with, and sometimes in aggregate that metadata can tell a story, but that will always be a risk as long as we are using email.<br />

The problem is, how do you ensure that ALL your email coming into your account is encrypted?

				Why would it matter what other people send you? There&#039;s no proof that you&#039;re involved? I get spam emails from porn sites acting as if the girl on the cam knows me from Facebook. Starts off with something like &quot;Hey remember me? We chatted on Facebook 3 months ago? Remember I said I was moving near your town? Well I did it! It would be cool if we could link up...&quot; Or some shit like that. <br /><br />All the sender did is maybe fuck themselves over. Don&#039;t reply to it. If it leads to your account being banned, just start up a new one and don&#039;t let that idiot know about the new one. <br /><br />I think people are getting a little too paranoid. The most important thing is protecting the real you and where the real you lives and making sure the dots to illegal shit don&#039;t connect back to the real you.

				Ugh, since I never had much need to utilize TorMail for SR business, I think I&#039;ll just do without.<br /><br />Another idea I had was possibly using the fake Yahoo! e-mail account I have that I use for cashing out, sub-account my vendor e-mail address or something. But it sounds iffy.

				Bitmessage P2P client run through TOR seems interesting.&nbsp; Also a service that turns those messages into emails that is a .onion site: http://bitmailendavkbec.onion<br /><br />Seems promising.&nbsp; Although I would still do my own PGP encryption.

				astor, I only understood a portion of the audit report.&nbsp; Though, can&#039;t all of that risk of the new/buggy/ tech be greatly limited by using the onion site, with the squirrel mail, that is the gateway to the bitmessage network for you and self pgp all communications?

The nymserver doesn&#039;t require the other people that I correspond with to use PGP (or even be aware that PGP exists.) From the other parties&#039; perspective, it&#039;s just another email address, like Tormail, or Lavabit, or what have you. The idea of using a nymserver is for _MY_ protection, not so much the other guy&#039;s. I used a Tormail account as a reply-block destination -- as a result, when the authorities attempt to read its contents, they will not be able to determine who was writing to me, or what about.&nbsp; The entire reason for using a nymserver is to protect oneself in the case of an email server compromise like what happened to Tormail. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				It really is a bitch that LavaBit had to be destroyed in order to keep Snowden&#039;s info safe from the feds, but I admire that the LavaBit admin wouldn&#039;t be pressured to give in. <br /><br />Anyway, as regards keeping your communications private I wouldn&#039;t feel safe connecting to an email site via clearnet. If the feds suspect that (for example) SellerX@safe-mail.net is the email account of someone selling narcotics, and they can get the admin of Safe-mail.net to hand over all records for the SellerX account then they&#039;ll see who the SellerX account has been communicating with. If SellerX is communicating with you, and the IP you were assigned can be traced to you IRL, then you may have a problem. <br /><br />Even if the messages are encrypted and unable to be deciphered, there&#039;s still going to be a question about why you and a suspected seller are exchanging messages. That&#039;s why if you&#039;re emailing someone about a deal that could land you in jail, it&#039;s important to remain anonymous when connecting to the email account you use for that deal. <br />

				@CaptainSensible<br /><br />That&#039;s why Silent Circle shut down their email service. As a protocol it isn&#039;t safe to use for sensitive communication.<br />
