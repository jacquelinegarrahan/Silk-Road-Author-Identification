				I am going to drive a long distance with a personal amount of MDMA and probably 4-aco-DMT through a very scrutinized area. What do you think is the best way to hide it? This is for a festival.<br /><br />1) Put into a vitamin capsules, fill empty space with filler, and put into vitamin organizer box.<br />2) Put into vitamin capsule, fill like 20 other capsules with filler (like sugar) and put them all into the same vitamin bottle. When I want to use, just take all 20.<br />3) Dissolve into bottle of water (not ideal because I might like to divide up a couple doses between people).<br />4) Sandwich between a couple slices of cheese in a packet and throw into a cooler of food.<br />5) Buy a safe disguised as a can of fruit cocktail or something and put that with my other food.<br /><br />Maybe my plans seem a little excessive but I want to take ZERO chance of getting caught.

				I would go with the sandwich method, myself. But more importantly, drive carefully. Don&#039;t speed and obey all traffic laws. Don&#039;t give LE an excuse to pull you over.

				Sorry to state the obvious but the safest way is not to drive with it but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s unavoidable since you are asking the question. I&#039;d put it somewhere on my body. Even if you do get pulled over they might search your car which they shouldn&#039;t unless when you get pulled over and open the window a cloud of weed smoke comes out. But yeah just do the speed limit and follow the traffic laws.. oh no broken taillights or headlights too! lol

				Hide it under the spare tire which is presumably in the boot. Depending on where you stay they may not have the jurisdiction to search the boot without good reason. Or inside a condom or something similar inside a bottle of shampoo? If the area is heavily scrutinized they&#039;re probably hoping for easy arrests like the one&#039;s mentioned above and people silly enough to just not have hidden their stash. And if you do get searched be cool, it doesn&#039;t automatically mean you&#039;re going to get busted. A lot of people freeze up and get nervous and that&#039;s something cops will hone in on. <br /><br />Be cool.

				One thing that I have done before is use one of thoe magnetic keyholders you can get from walmart or an automotive store. Its large enough to hold a couple g&#039;s of something and you can place it on anything metal under the hood or underneath the carraige. I&#039;ve driven 50+ miles and it wont fall off or anything. Plus, you can get really creative.

				I like the idea of dissolving it in a bottle of water.<br />Just take a syringe with you (without the needle!), you can &#039;hide&#039; it in your first aid kit.<br />

				just smell proof it an put it in your underwear.....the smell proofing is if you think they will be drug stops along the way...as some times they do that before shows. Sometimes its fake an you see a sign that says K-9 ahead an the people that turn around they go after....tricky bastards.

				Know your rights, cops can&#039;t just straight up search your shit. If they have dogs, it would be better to just let the cops look around though. I&#039;ve never seen cops look in an engine compartment on a regular search so maybe hide it in there.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Cops can pat you down &#039;looking for weapons&#039;, and this is legal. They will use this oppurtunity to look through your wallet and cigarette pack of course, and if they find anything, they will say any number of things, &#039;in plain sight&#039;, &#039;he gave permission to search&#039; etc. If&nbsp; you hide it in the drivers compartment,&nbsp; they are pretty good on finding stuff, and when a new good way to hide stuff comes out, they learn about it pretty quickly. In the US, I&nbsp; think the best place would be in the trunk or engine compartment. <br />Cops get &#039;gut&#039; feelings that they use to expand their searches. If you are friendly and don&#039;t have a chip on your shoulder and demand what they pulled&nbsp; you over for, or why you are being searched, usually their unwanted visit ends earlier than otherwise. <br />Driving with any number of clues that you are in the area to score is a good way to get unwanted attention. If you&#039;re in a bad area (where open air drug markets are, you stop and a bunch of people come up to your car to try to sell you stuff, you can have a high probability of getting pulled over quickly after leaving although the &#039;open air&#039; markets generally keep their eyes out pretty darn carefully. <br />Driving with another person, and you don&#039;t know them well, cops always separate people and ask routine questions to try to trip you up. Once they know you are lying, they know that you are lying for some reason and this guides their search. <br />Hard to change their attention once you get it. Better to avoid their attention even if it&#039;s a little more trouble to lower your odds. Realize that the more often you&#039;re breaking the law, the law of averages can add up and &#039;get&#039; you. The less people know about you, the less they can tell the cops if they are under pressure. And generally people never arrested before and worried about jail time (or worse) can be predictably pressured with promises to let their offense &#039;slide&#039; if the cops think that you know a bigger fish that they can harvest. <br />Drugs are a special category because usually both people in the deal, buyer and seller, are happy with the completed transaction. So cops need special advantages and being the country that the US is (most people in jail in the world, and the highest per capita of confined people too) people are easily brainwashed into the &#039;evils&#039; of drugs. <br />Once I thought that being a certain distance from drugs (under a bush 30 feet away) gave you protection if in the event they have stopped you and think that you are drug affliated. Unless it&#039;s weed, pretty much everything is a felony and cops like to bring in felonies cause it gets them good attention. So in this case, the cop said&nbsp; that he saw me put the drugs&nbsp; there. I was pretty surprised, you can bet. <br />

				Vacuum seal it and then toss it in the trunk and forget about it. Being paranoid/nervous/whatever is the easiest way to get fucked over by a cop.

				I drove across my state a month back with MDMA and I just hid it in with some medical supplies in my medic bag in the trunk. Of course the most important thing to do is to drive VERY CAREFULLY and do not give some bored cop an excuse to pull you over. Make sure your brake lights work. Stuff like that.

				If you want to be sure they won&#039;t find it; simply put it in the smallest baggie you can (double wrapped), and keep it near your bum. If you see those flashing light... you&#039;ll know what to do. My friends laugh at me, but you never know when you&#039;ll get that asshole cop who tears apart everything (but not your ass).<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason why the CIA and prisoners both utilize the bum, it works.

				I like a lot of the ideas here, especially the dissolving it in water method....<br /><br />Me personally, when I ride with any personal amount of drugs on me, I always have it in close distance to eat it in case....unless I have a reallly reallllly good hiding spot such as that dissolving in water method^.<br /><br />If you get pulled, just eat it. A permanent criminal charge is not worth the risk to protect your personal amount of drugs, even if you think you can talk off the cop... I mean, what if you can&#039;t, what if he&#039;s a dick and searches you anyway and you get charged with a felony. <br /><br />Personally though, the safest way to drive with any drugs is to simply not get pulled over. Really, it&#039;s not hard, just be careful with your driving and make sure your all of your lights are in tact. In 3 years of driving I have only gotten pulled over once, and that was for going 60 in a 35, when I didn&#039;t know it was a city area...Just drive smart.
