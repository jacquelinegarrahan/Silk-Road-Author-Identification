				I&#039;ve set up a PO box that allows me to add an additional name along with the name I already have set up on it(my own). An option is to use a business name, no questions asked.<br /><br />My questions are: will the postman question the sudden influx of letters addressed to my home address? Is it commonplace for business-addressed names to appear for residential mailboxes? <br /><br />Which business names should my fake one be along the lines of? I won&#039;t rip it directly from the suggestions here.<br /><br />Thank you!

Do you not have to show ID and register it in your own name before being able to use another one? I&#039;m thinking of setting up a PO Box myself but I think the Post Office would certainly give out the name it&#039;s been registered to if something illicit were sent there...<br /><br />V.

WHY LET ANY VENDOR KNOW YOUR REAL NAME?<br /><br />&nbsp;The logic of a &quot;fake name&quot; to a residence being bad is solid.. but if you can add a business name legitimately to an address.. use it! Vendors are the threat to buyers. Without vendor cooperation no buyer can be touched. Buyers cannot threaten a wise vendor. Also if you buy tweak or other stuff that attracts crazies dealing it.. why give them a real name? How much do you trust them?<br /><br />&nbsp;I have scads of business type mail coming into my mailbox and lots of it looks like unsolicited first class junk mail. <br /><br />&nbsp;
