				Hi all Tor-minators,<br /><br />I set up a second user account on my Mac.&nbsp; My bitcoin program allowed me to open it and set up a second wallet using the same application icon from the app folder.&nbsp; However, when I tried to start Tor, it wouldn&#039;t, and I got an error message about the Tor program belonging to a different user.&nbsp; The Tor application icon is in the app folder when using the second user; but just won&#039;t open. <br /><br />Do I need to download the Tor browser bundle again while I&#039;m signed in as the second user?&nbsp; And if I do so, is there *any chance at all* that it would overwrite the existing Tor bundle under the first user?&nbsp; I am *very* concerned about that because I somehow corrupted the Tor browser bundle once and lost my data; particularly all the .onion addresses and bookmarks (plus I stored my very unique passwords in the bookmarks) and I had a hell of a time reconstructing all of that stuff.<br /><br />How can I get Tor to work, and have a second fresh set of bookmarks to use (just like when you open Firefox under a second user).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure this is probably a very stupid question, but it has me totally flummoxed.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; for your help.&nbsp; :)

				First try: Verify Tor is in /Applications, not ~/Applications<br /><br />In Finder, go to your hard disk.&nbsp; The default is to call it Macintosh HD.&nbsp; You might have changed it.&nbsp; Go to this folder and you should see a folder called Applications, along with Library, System, and Users folders.&nbsp; This application folder is accessible to all user accounts and its full pathname is /Applications.&nbsp; Apple sometimes likes to make another Applications folder in your home folder.&nbsp; The home folder is probably called your username for the account (eg joeblow2) and has the documents, pictures, music, etc associated with the account.&nbsp; If you installed Tor to this applications folder, then only that user can see it.&nbsp; This design is a security feature of Unix systems (modularity prevents a &quot;bad folder&quot; from &quot;infecting&quot; other folders), but can be confusing it you aren&#039;t familiar with the file structure.&nbsp; Move the Tor Browser Bundle to /Applications and you should see it from your second account.&nbsp; The &quot;/&quot; indicates &quot;root&quot; as in the root of your file system.&nbsp; When you format your hard disk with Mac OS, the Unix file structure it uses creates a root folder where the entire system goes (called &quot;/&quot;) and users are made deeper down the file system ( in /Users/ on Mac OS X).&nbsp; The ~/Applications refers to the Applications folder inside the home folder for the user (shorthand: ~).<br /><br />Once you have verified that Tor is in the correct Applications folder,&nbsp; switch to the second account and try it.&nbsp; If it still fails, do this:<br /><br />Right click on the Tor Browser Bundle and select &quot;Get Info&quot;.&nbsp; At the bottom of this panel you should see a section called &quot;Sharing and Permissions:&quot;&nbsp; Go ahead and click on the arrow beside the name of this subpanel if it is pointing horizontally.&nbsp; When it is pointing vertically, you should have a list of Names with Privleges.&nbsp; The name that is your user name (for both accounts) should be listed and the privilge should be Read Only.&nbsp; If it is Read &amp; Write that should be fine too.&nbsp; You just need to make sure that the user should be able to read the contents of the application.&nbsp; Again, &quot;permissions&quot; are a security feature of Unix-like systems.&nbsp; Before anything can be done to a system, the user trying to make the changes needs to have the permissions to make the changes.&nbsp; This is why you have to put in your user password when installing an application -- only the root user (accessed via your system password) can make changes in the root folder (like installing an application to /Application).<br /><br />Hope this helps!
