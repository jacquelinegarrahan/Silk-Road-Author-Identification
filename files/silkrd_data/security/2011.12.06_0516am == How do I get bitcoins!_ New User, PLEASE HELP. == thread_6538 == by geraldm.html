				I&#039;m a new user, and I have no idea how to anonymously get bitcoins. <br />I had the idea to buy a prepaid Visa gift card, is there a website I can use it on? <br />I know get-bitcoin has a spot for prepaid debit cards... Is a Visa gift card a prepaid debit card?<br /><br />Any other simple anonymous ways to get bitcoins fast?

				If you want bitcoins RIGHT NOW, then you could buy a moneypak at a local convenience store and use a vendor on here who will send bitcoins to your account in exchange for the moneypak.<br /><br />Get-bitcoin is also an option if you want to use cash or some type of prepaid card, but that would involve physically mailing it to them which would take significantly longer.

				What is a moneypak? I&#039;ve never heard of them and don&#039;t know where to get them. But I HAVE seen that some users will exchange their coins for them. Are they anonymous? What type of convenience store would sell them? What do they even look like, would thhey be with gift cards?

				Getting bitcoins is easy and can be done in a matter of minutes. Getting anonymous bitcoins, however, is a bit more tricky. Someone already mentioned moneypak, but that&#039;s only available to customers in the US (I believe). Where are you based?

Can&#039;t say for sure, though, I&#039;ve never tried it myself.

				I registered a new Western Union account and added a confirmed bank account just to try Western Union&#039;s service to transfer funds to get-bitcoin. They declined to make the transfer saying, &quot;All I can tell is that is was a business decision to decline this transfer.&quot; Anyone else had this happen?<br /><br />I never have any trouble using Dwolla to purchase from get-bitcoin.

				I doubt any of us work for Western Union, it would be best if you take issue with them over their business practices. All of your questions have been answered time and again, please use the search function.

				I&#039;d use this method:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_vCsFyJtCw<br /><br />Just use an anonymous email address, and select the email method (not SMS).<br /><br />Then you can take the cash to any bank branch, anywhere in the US, of Bank of America, Citibank, Chase, or Wells Fargo, and they don&#039;t ask you for your name or ID.<br /><br />It&#039;s very similar to using Western Union, but the total cost is only a 4.49% fee.
