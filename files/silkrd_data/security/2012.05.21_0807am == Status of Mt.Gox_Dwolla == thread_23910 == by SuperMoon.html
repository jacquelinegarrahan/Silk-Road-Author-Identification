				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Im getting a lot of mixed messages here on how safe Dwolla&gt;Mt.Gox is for making transactions.&nbsp; As far as i can tell SR masks the path of bitcoins once it enters the site and you could even put them through multiple wallets before sending to SR. A lot of people are saying &quot;dont give dwolla an ID&quot; and making is sound like buying BTC on Mt.Gox is a sure way to get busted but i have to think everyone&#039;s just being paranoid.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe there are more anonymous ways to buy BTC but moving BTC though multiple wallets that could potentially belong to any number of people seems like enough to at least make it very difficult to tell which Mt.Gox account is funding which SR account.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a few hundred dollars in my Dwolla act. and even though i may just stop using it because it&#039;s a pain in the ass, should i be too worried about moving what i have to mt.gox and eventually to SR?<br />

I don&#039;t see the problem with choosing the slow and secure path (also more costly) over being as unsafe as possible.

				Dude, take the money out of evil Dwolla and put it back in your bank account.&nbsp; Order your coins on get-bitcoin with cash in the mail.&nbsp; Dwolla keeps your info for 3 years.&nbsp; Stay as anonymous as possible.&nbsp; I don&#039;t trust Dwolla or the exchanges for that matter.&nbsp; Time to go even further underground.

Excluding of course situations where the cops already have my computer but like i said, by that time i&#039;m already in a world of shit. :P<br /><br />Its not like LE can just grill Mt.Gox users about why they want BTC. Unless they can... :P
