				Hello all,<br /><br />I discovered SR a couple of days ago and was absolutely blown away. The very day I discovered it I was so eager to get started that I made a Mt. Gox account, rushed to the bank, and made a cash deposit. I now have a few orders in transit and am pissing myself with excitement!<br /><br />But now I&#039;m suffering from the paranoia you all must experience time to time using this website. I made up a random username and password for SR that I&#039;ve never used for anything else before. Thing is I used the same name &amp; password for my new Mt. Gox account, and logged into Mt. Gox using Firefox as it wouldn&#039;t work well with TOR. I&#039;m worried that LE could possibly track me down by matching my name &amp; password on SR to the same name &amp; password on Mt. Gox, then find my real IP address or whatever via Mt. Gox. Would this hold up in court? Do I have anything to worry about? Should I make a new Mt. Gox account? A new SR account?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				I don&#039;t know about the legal side of things but I&#039;d get new accounts immediately with different usernames and passwords.&nbsp; Then hope none of the orders you already made attract any attention in transit.&nbsp; You definitely compromised yourself more than you should by using the same usernames in both places, also by trying to log into MtGox using TOR, they&#039;re known to get suspicious of that.&nbsp; It will make it a lot easier for law enforcement to build a case against you and convict you if you make it so easy for them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I remember correctly but I think usernames from SR have leaked out before, so it&#039;s not unreasonable to think that law enforcement might have lists of them too.&nbsp; So don&#039;t use your real name as your username or use the SR username anywhere else, especially not at MtGox or similar services.
