				Update: They got back, there server had locked and they did fix it now (wipe forehead). If you lost any transactions be sure to send support a message.<br /><br />Sigh, my previous endorsements of this place just fell down the drain now. <br /><br />Not sure if it was an error on their side or they have gone rogue. But they have not gotten back on the support request. And now i&#039;ve got a large BTC transaction thats irreversable into their wallet that doesnt show up in my balance almost 16 hours later.<br /><br />Guessing i&#039;m just out of luck here, so is the game of the underworld.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update if the situation changes.<br /><br />- Stay safe <br /><br />

				I just got a response from BCF, they said everything is working as normal but there seemed to be a problem specifically with my deposit and it should be sorted within a few hours. I&#039;ll update how this turns out but it sounds fine now.<br /><br />UPDATE: All good for me now too. Biggest scare.

				I am a newbie, and I can only hope that Bitcoin Fog is just still having problems.<br />Because I put in my bitcoins, requested they be sent to SR, and have received only<br />2% of what I asked for. I know the service fee could be between 1 and 3 %, but the rest should be here and it is not. I have emailed support over the past 5 hours with no word. Any thoughts?

BTW the service fee is incoming not outgoing, so whatever your account showed you will be able to deposit.<br /><br />Also they recommend staggering incoming/outgoing... IE input 50 output 20 input 4 output 29, things like that so the in/out ammounts dont match, masks it further.<br /><br />The problem they were having when I had issue atleast was their server actually locked up and was not receiving BTC at all, even though the BTC was confirmed on the network. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure everything will be ok (They did take over a day to respond to me, which I guess in hindsite isn&#039;t that big of a deal, but when freaking out over large sums of money it seems like an eternity).
