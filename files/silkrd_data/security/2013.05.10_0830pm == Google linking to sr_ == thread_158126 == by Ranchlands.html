				Yeah google has been crawling SR for a while, manly through onion.to. <br /><br />I was really shocked when I first saw it too - you can find most of SR on google through it.

The last thing you want is a digital footprint revealing you have Googled &#039;silk road&#039; or &#039;silk road forums&#039; 500 times, they&#039;re not dumb, they will figure out very quickly why someone would have reason to search for it repeatedly. Once or twice is forgivable but every time you log on to the forums? Not a good idea. <br /><br />Same argument with bitcoins. How many times have I heard someone say, &quot;buying bitcoins is totally legal&quot; and then argue that there&#039;s no need to use any buffers between purchasing and dumping them into their SR acc./s without a condom as it were.<br /><br />Bottom line. Don&#039;t do it or you&#039;ll significantly increase your chances of being caught.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Does anyone have an example of a search that actually returned a silk road URL?&nbsp; Or actual content from SR (not just a link to it)?<br /><br />I mean I have seen many clearnet sites with links to SR in Google&#039;s results but have never seen a .onion link.<br /><br />If google is starting to index all of our forums and display these results as regular links that would be a bit more concerning to me than it just finding SR related business on the clearnet.
