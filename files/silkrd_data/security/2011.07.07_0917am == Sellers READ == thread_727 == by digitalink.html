				I have no idea if this is mentioned anywhere else, I don&#039;t have the time to go through every post. But here&#039;s just a reminder even to those who haven&#039;t had the time either. There has been rumor that one of law enforcements latest tactics is becoming a seller and pretending to sell thing&#039;s while gathering Intel on buyers. Sellers beware. I HIGHLY recommend (if you don&#039;t already) to create a SR account you use just for when you buy things. This latest tactic is a means to grab the &#039;big fish&#039;. It would be way to costly, to much trouble and would lack enforcement approval to go after buyers. Many of reasons which include they have barely enough evidence to gain a warrant of any kind, let alone the time to find out if your one of the 5% of people on here that actually use your real address. They are looking to nab the big sellers.. so PLEASE, remember this word of caution, if you SELL and want to BUY, use a different account if you don&#039;t do that already.

				Hey guys. Im sorry to sound all suspicious and all but I really didnt mean any harm. Im just a&nbsp; college student in the states. I have a bunch of people at school who want a lot weed. Im just trying to make some money off these kids. I just wanted some solid sellers who could provide if and all these kids want more. I know Im new to SR and im stepping on some unstable ground. An eighth to a ounce is the smallest quanitity posted on SR. I just wanted to ask a bunch of people who would be able to ship larger quantities. <br /><br />Anarcho47-Im sorry for that dumb question. Ive been looking around some other websites who were dealing but saw that they only ship inside Canada. If you don&#039;t believe me here&#039;s the site i was looking at. r2uxghppjeaqzis.onion

				Im very new to buying from the internet. Especially using bitcoins. Considering all the cash to bitcoin conversion I would have to do to ensure my anonymity at a local level, I would not like have have to go through the process of bitcoin exchange for small amounts. With the fluctuating bitcoin prices, I would also not want to keep bitcoins in my wallet until I transfer them to a seller. <br /><br />I made a noob mistake of sounding sketchy, Im sorry for the uneasiness i caused. As a college student trying to make some money off rich spoiled brats, money and price is of utter importance for me. Im trying to find the cheapest way of getting good quality weed to use and sell to those rich kids whom dont know the prices for exorbitant gain on my part. Although I will smoke some myself :)<br /><br />funyankeeguy-I was trying to pay anarcho to see if he/she would re-ship orders from another source outside the SR network but lives in Canada as well. I would hope as another American, you would know the very high prices of weed in the United States and the lack of large dealers accessible to a college student as I am.

				im not buying it. there are so many holes in your logic. for one, the prices here are too high to make a profit reselling. secondly, there are lots of sellers offering oz or more. you could easily order several of them, instead of asking a bunch of different sellers shady questions. thirdly, the link you posted doesnt work. next, no one that is new to this tries to jump in and buy as much as they can. nobody. also, the &quot;problems&quot; you describe in dealing with bitcoins. you arent special. its what everyone has to deal with if they want to buy bitcoins. your request for someone to reship for you is ridiculous. its as if you have no fear of being scammed. and the assumption that a college student in america cant get weed just simply astounds me. <br /><br />care to explain?

				What college do you go to where you are finding it difficult to acquire a large amount of weed?&nbsp; I was never interested in dealing but in college it would have been trivially easy to find someone moving large amounts if I wanted to resell.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously this is a rhetorical question, I dont expect you to tell me what college you go to, but I find it difficult to imagine that it would not be substantially easier/cheaper to source locally than on SR.&nbsp;

				I would love to explain to clear up this mess.<br /><br />The problem for me isn&#039;t acquiring large quantities of weed. There has been a crack down of drugs and weed at my school which has caused a fraternity to be kicked off campus due to &quot;illicit selling of drugs&quot; as they say. With this open gap of users who no longer have a dealer, is where I would like to come in. The market is open at the moment and other dealers are too scared to make a profit due to the several students getting kicked out of school already.<br /><br />SR has been basically a godsend for me trying to make some money at school. I am a biology major with a shit fuck ton of work to do. I do not have time to play, study, smoke weed all day, or have a decent job all at the same time. Using online anonymity using tor, I could receive money from weed-deprived students and ship them weed from sellers on SR. I would then use the profits made from these rich kids to pay for my own weed and help pay for college.<br />I do apologize for sounding super sketchy by asking multiple sellers if they sell in larger quantities.<br /><br />Funyankeeguy-I would understand your reasoning for not wanting to trust me due to myself sounding like the LE. <br /><br />Yes, prices here are very expensive. However, this is a better source of acquiring goods than on the streets. Your 1/8 mid grade medical is 2.61 bitcoins. With the current bitcoin rate, thats roughly 36 to 40 USD. Other students here buy an eighth for roughly 70 to 90 dollars. If you do the calculations right, with students buying an eighth for roughly 80 dollars each time, they would pay around 640 dollars for an ounce. With your prices if you shipped an ounce, it would cost 320-ish dollars, giving me a profit of 320 dollars. That doesn&#039;t seem much for the risk and amount of work put forth. Shipping the goods would be to the student&#039;s address who would buy from me. I&#039;m not making much per transaction, but that&#039;s one deal to one person. <br /><br />For other sellers, their prices are 21 to 40 bitcoins per ounce. Averaged out with a price of 30 bitcoins per ounce, that&#039;ll cost me roughly 420 dollars. Im not retarded, ive been scouting various sellers based on their good feedback, good quality weed, and their price. Even if its good weed, I&#039;m gonna be selling it at the same price, hence my profits would be lower.

				I live in the new england area…far away from good &#039;ole california. A Gram of any weed costs around 20~24 dollars for the user. I can get weed anywhere else, its not a problem. I rather have the anonymity using tor with no drugs ever touching my hands as i&#039;m shipping these SR goods to the clients, as I have no proof of any wrong doing with the fed/cops/campus police. <br /><br />You, funyankeeguy, you sell from the new england area. Considering &quot;yankee&quot; is a new england thing or near the tristate area, Your prices are decent and make me a profit if I were to re-sell your products to gullible rich students. I&#039;m not trying to make a killing/lifestyle selling weed, I simply would like to make enough so I could buy and smoke my own weed without having to spend MY money which I make from working.<br /><br />Low prices, good weed, gullible rich kids who are willing to pay gives me a good profit. Im very scared of being scammed. I lose money on my end with angry clients without their goods. Hence, I thought a respected seller would be able to solve that issue. I made a mistake of rushing relationships with anarcho47 and I have already apologized to him/her. My current method of acquiring bitcoins is to buy a shit ton a pre-paid debit cards from various stores to lower my heat. I would then have to somehow transfer these debit cards to mt.gox, then to SR, then to the sellers. Thats a lot of work I don&#039;t have time to do for every transaction for a little 1/8 oz. of weed. Thats why Ive been asking RESPECTED sellers such as yourself and anarcho47 and others if you were to sell in bulk, hence I would be able to do business without having to do the bitcoin conversion every time for little amounts.<br /><br />if any of the students were to get caught, they wouldnt have any shit on me cause I do not have any evidence of selling drugs to anyone with my room/apartment being clean from the lack of drugs i WOULD BE holding, if I did sell directly. Im making money and able to get good weed for myself without all the risk others are putting themselves into. With the discreet shipping by seller like YOU, the campus police would only know kids are receiving drugs through the mail. They would likely search the incoming mail. I am only doing this for the duration of my college stay. If anything were to happen, I would quit buying weed and other drugs from SR and stop selling to rich kids. <br /><br />With the economy these days and shops not wanting to hire college kids due to their limited summer stay, SR is a good way for me to make some summer money. As away if you still have any doubts please. I would understand if you no longer want to sell to me as well for this little LE scare. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain myself.

				Maybe i&#039;m not understanding this and maybe my logic is off. When you get an order, collect the money from the student then place an order with your buyer account and ship to the students address. You may have to wait til it arrives to collect but thats how I would do it.

Cares. <br /><br />@MaroonCode - This isn&#039;t Amazon as you have probably figured out by now. You are 100% LE if you are asking for large amounts and trying to get people to reship. Srsly. Asking a VENDOR to give out their address??? Talk about DERP!<br /><br />Just go away and buy weed IRL

A Gram of any weed costs around 20~24 dollars for the user. I can get weed anywhere else, its not a problem. I rather have the anonymity using tor with no drugs ever touching my hands as i&#039;m shipping these SR goods to the clients, as I have no proof of any wrong doing with the fed/cops/campus police. <br /><br />You, funyankeeguy, you sell from the new england area. Considering &quot;yankee&quot; is a new england thing or near the tristate area, Your prices are decent and make me a profit if I were to re-sell your products to gullible rich students. I&#039;m not trying to make a killing/lifestyle selling weed, I simply would like to make enough so I could buy and smoke my own weed without having to spend MY money which I make from working.<br /><br />Low prices, good weed, gullible rich kids who are willing to pay gives me a good profit. Im very scared of being scammed. I lose money on my end with angry clients without their goods. Hence, I thought a respected seller would be able to solve that issue. I made a mistake of rushing relationships with anarcho47 and I have already apologized to him/her. My current method of acquiring bitcoins is to buy a shit ton a pre-paid debit cards from various stores to lower my heat. I would then have to somehow transfer these debit cards to mt.gox, then to SR, then to the sellers. Thats a lot of work I don&#039;t have time to do for every transaction for a little 1/8 oz. of weed. Thats why Ive been asking RESPECTED sellers such as yourself and anarcho47 and others if you were to sell in bulk, hence I would be able to do business without having to do the bitcoin conversion every time for little amounts.<br /><br />if any of the students were to get caught, they wouldnt have any shit on me cause I do not have any evidence of selling drugs to anyone with my room/apartment being clean from the lack of drugs i WOULD BE holding, if I did sell directly. Im making money and able to get good weed for myself without all the risk others are putting themselves into. With the discreet shipping by seller like YOU, the campus police would only know kids are receiving drugs through the mail. They would likely search the incoming mail. I am only doing this for the duration of my college stay. If anything were to happen, I would quit buying weed and other drugs from SR and stop selling to rich kids. <br /><br />With the economy these days and shops not wanting to hire college kids due to their limited summer stay, SR is a good way for me to make some summer money. As away if you still have any doubts please. I would understand if you no longer want to sell to me as well for this little LE scare. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain myself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Where in New England?<br /><br />There&#039;s tons of weed up there. Even in remote Vermont they have some really good bud. Why not take a drive to boston and stock up and sell it to all the trust fund babies, or is boston dry too? ANd no piggy I&#039;m not from New England area but I went to school up there, smoked and sold bud , my dorm was a few blocks from a head shop and you could see Fenway from my dorm.. next time you try undercover work maybe come up with something better than no pot on campus. Every fucking campus in this country has pot, even the high school kids are selling/smoking bud.

Where do you get this money for this big bulk purchase if you are just a poor college kid without a job?<br />If you are buying in bulk why are you talking about using a seller on SR as a drop shipper? <br /><br />If I were a seller here I would have taken your money and used it to pay for freebies for my REAL customers and told you that you just paid to get a bunch of people high you stupid pig.
