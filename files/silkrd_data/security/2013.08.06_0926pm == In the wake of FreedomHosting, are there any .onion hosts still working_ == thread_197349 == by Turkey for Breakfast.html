				TorHost has been down for a long time. The only hosting provider I could find with a working link is AnonHosting, although I&#039;ve never heard of anyone using it. It could be a scam. More importantly, there&#039;s no way to purchase an account, since their two contact methods are SimplePM, which is down, and -- you guessed -- Tormail!<br /><br />Anyway, here&#039;s the address: http://wevuysiyescilvc7.onion

				Make your own hidden service. <br /><br />Follow the instructions here to set up a relay, except make it a hidden service instead of a relay<br />https://www.torservers.net/wiki/setup/server<br /><br />Follow Torproject.org instructions to edit Torrc file to enable hidden service, then copy the private key it generates and save it. Edit lighttpd error pages to not reveal information, even better build it from source and rip out any identifying marks like version numbers ect. Remove binaries like ping, telnet, anything an attacker would use. Bind lighttpd to localhost (Tor). For a tiny information site good enough security

				I setup a hidden service for image hosting a few days ago. It had security features to prevent IP leaks and entry guard identification, though I won&#039;t mention the specific features for obvious security reasons. I still took it down though. Honestly, I&#039;m not comfortable running a hidden service until we find out how Marques was identified. I also don&#039;t have the resources to host the entire Tor or even SR community&#039;s images if it became the default image host. I also don&#039;t have the time or energy to police it for the massive amounts of CP it would get if it became the default image host.<br /><br />Most people here are not technically savvy enough to run their own hidden services safely. Honestly comsec, it&#039;s a bad idea to suggest it to random people. They are going to get themselves into trouble. However, there are technically savvy users here who could consult anyone who has the resources to take on the challenge of running (potentially large) hidden services.<br />

				comsec, we need to have a talk.<br /><br />You are a smart guy, but I&#039;ve noticed a pattern with you, that you vastly overestimate the competence of the average SR user. I&#039;m not knocking them, not everyone can be a tech expert. Weeks ago you recommended against using Tails, when it&#039;s pretty much the safest out of the box way random newbs who know nothing about technology can use Tor.

				Was SR having its own image server discussed or shot down by DPR?<br /><br />After this whole FH fiasco, it might be more attractive to have this community a bit more self contained or insulated from the &#039;dangers&#039; lurking about the deep web.<br /><br />I&#039;m still pretty upset with myself for my ignorance and lack of awareness that following image links might be taking me to places I wouldn&#039;t want to go, and in the process, potentially exposing myself to an utterly different type of criminality to which I have not subscribed, nor am willing, to be personally, morally or criminally liable for.&nbsp; (Yes, I&#039;m a fucking pothead, and pretty proud of it...online, at least.)<br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;m not saying Torchat and Bitmessage are safe, but they are examples of what I&#039;d like to see in more secure forms. I have mentioned before that I&#039;d love to see a Qubes Server Edition, which would be an out of the box solution for VM isolated servers, like a Whonix version of hidden services. It would be developed by security professionals and could be rolled out by a larger number of users. However, telling people to run and harden their own hidden services is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />If everyone was running their own hidden service, a lot of people would have been pwned a lot sooner than this FH bust. If those pedo sites had been individually run by their administrators, some of them would have been taken down much longer ago. Same goes for vendors who would have hosted their own drug sites.<br /><br />BTW, the reason so many people may have been pwned by the FH exploit is they didn&#039;t know to disable JavaScript and update their browser bundle in a timely manner, but you expect them to run hidden services. Think about it.<br /><br /><br />

				I have to say I agree with Astor here. I&#039;m no idiot, but I am far from technically savvy enough to do some of the things being discussed. I freely admit I have a lot to learn yet, even though I managed to set up reply blocks for sending encrypted email through ermailers (with a little help from some friends) and a few other things.<br /><br />But to set up a hidden service using a VM or something like that, well, that just flies well over my head.<br /><br />goblin

				TBH, it&#039;s easy to set up a hidden service. You can copy-paste commands from a tutorial to install a web server + PHP + MySQL, then install Tor and uncomment a couple lines in torrc. You can be up and running with a hidden service in under 10 minutes.<br /><br />It&#039;s much harder to set up a *secure* hidden service.<br /><br />
