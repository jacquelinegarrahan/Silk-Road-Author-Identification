				When they open back up tomorrow it will be my first time using them. I was wondering if they would make the deposit into my SR wallet if I gave them the wallet code without telling them that it is SR. Just asking a question, I understand this may not be safe so no reason to flame me&nbsp; ::)

				They would. The SR address is just another address: BST has no way of knowing whether it&#039;s one you just created or one generated elsewhere. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s a bad idea for a few reasons, but you already said you&#039;re aware of the safety issues, so I&#039;ll leave it at that. :)

				I wouldn&#039;t count on using them tomorrow. They are now pushing back their reopen date, admit to having 17 backorders, and even say they have unprecedented supply chain problems meaning they have no coin. I think I would wait and let them iron out their problems before jumping right in. Especially since they make it clear they don&#039;t have any coins. If they do get stock tomorrow I imagine they will just go right into a backlog of orders again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it reflects negatively on them either. Bitcoin price is low right now and people don&#039;t or won&#039;t sell. In fact this is the best time to buy so everyone is going to be short. I noticed places like BitInstant start getting complaints when BTC prices are low. Either from lack of supply or they simply don&#039;t want to part with them for 90 bucks a coin when they can wait it out and see the coins increase in value over the next couple of weeks. The volatility is just a pain in the ass. Anyway, it does strike me as odd that BTC took a dive this morning and they pushed back their reopen date. They either can&#039;t get their hands on the coins or they are not willing to part with them right now. Price seems to be rebounding a bit though.

				Just use a tumbling service instead of deposting directly to your SR wallet.&nbsp; Then the address you give them will have no connection to SR anyway, and even if they did try to look at where it was going, they would have to dig pretty far.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure if you can find where coins are going if you use Bitcoin Fog.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great service, I would suggest you use that if you&#039;re not in a rush to get the coins to your SR wallet, as it takes a minumum of 6 hours to transfer all the coins to your wallet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck.
