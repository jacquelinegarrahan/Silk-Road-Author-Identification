				So I just set up my keys with GPG Keychain Access on my MacBookPro 10.6.8<br /><br />Looking at my keys I see my &quot;pub&quot; and &quot;sec&quot; keys (the pair). My question is I see my private key (secrete) with the name I filled in to match my name on SR, but my Pub key&#039;s name says &quot;GPGTools Project Team&quot; with an email of &quot;gpgtools-org@lists.gpgtools.org&quot;. I don&#039;t recall typing that in, i used a different fake email. in the comments section it says &quot;official openPGP key&quot; This is all on the GPG Chain Access keys window/list. <br /><br />Did I miss something? I look at the public keys I import from potential vendors and on the list it looks more normal ex: Pub - streetpharmacy - streetpharmacy@tormail.com - etc. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pub - premiumdutchUK@tormail.com <br />or even this one users who posted to other users to test their gpg: Pub - Klaaat21 - fake2222@yahoo.com<br /><br />So why does my Pub key say all this GPG project team crap? <br /><br />Any help would be great thanks for your patience and kindness<br />i&#039;ve been looking at the forums and i feel like i&#039;m 50% there with this. This one link to a supposidly Mac tutorial with pics didn&#039;t work for me but the instructions were helpful kinda. I&#039;m more of a VISUAL LEARNER so if anyone has a good step by step with pics that work or a video...shooooooot i&#039;d be set and greatful! <br /><br />thanks again!
