				Today, I did a cursory web search, and a BUNCH of forum results from this site came up through onion.to and tor2web.org.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t onion results be free from crawling?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done a similar test for the main site, but would be happy to do such a search if anyone&#039;s interested.&nbsp; Either way, I think this may need to be fixed.

				It is possible to make the forum only readable by members only, thus you wouldn&#039;t be able to view the forum as a guest, you would HAVE to sign up and some people might not like that..

				omg stop the panic, admins can just set a robots.txt that forbids google to crawl.<br />LE can crawl the forum regardless of google and it comes with a built in search function anyway.<br /><br />The more concerning question is how much tor bandwidth is used up by clearnet search engines crawling onionland.<br />On the other hand this might get a lot of people aware of Tor if they accidently stumble upon a .onion.to page and wonder about the strange url...

				You are right actually, I was thinking if the domain is dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to that it would check onion.to/robots.txt but it takes the subdomain into consideration so it would load http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/robots.txt /me embarrassed

				My concern isn&#039;t with people finding out about this site, it&#039;s with the information that people reveal on this forum due to a false sense of security.&nbsp; The information people are revealing can lead to personal identification, especially if users of this site use the same username across multiple networks &amp; public forums, where they may be more likely to reveal even more information.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been here for over a year -- I&#039;ve watched the community grow from just a couple hundred members to the size it is now.&nbsp; Security is my main concern, and I think it should be a big concern for a lot of people here.<br /><br />robots.txt would be a good start, and I believe that putting this behind a protected login should be a minimal step taken by administrators.&nbsp; That way, spiders that don&#039;t respect robots.txt will be stopped, and this site will fall off of the indices.
