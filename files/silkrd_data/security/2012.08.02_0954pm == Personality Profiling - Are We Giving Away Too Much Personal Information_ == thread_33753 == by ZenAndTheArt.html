				From reading these forums for the past four months I&#039;ve got to know some of the general personal details of the regular posters. <br />If LE is also reading the posts on this forum, they could be creating (to a greater or lesser extent) personality profiles on some of the members.<br />If I can read between the lines and fill in the gaps to get a general idea of some members details (jobs, location, marital status, wealth, sex, colour etc.) then a professional profiler would do a much better job. Do you think this is something we should worry about or does it not matter that much? Could they really use it effectively against us? Thoughts anyone?<br /><br />*gets tin foil hat out* :-X :-X :-X

				Excellent post for discussion! +1!<br /><br />Not only can they profile you based on your personal traits, but also your typing style, spelling, etc. Always be self-conscious of the personal image you are creating with your words. Never give away anything (or a combination of things) unique to you or your immediate geographical area. Don&#039;t get too personal either; if you have to, just make shit up without coming off as a bullshit artist trying to inflate their ego. Obviously this applies to vendors and other high risk members more so than occasional buyers, however, you never know where you are going to end up one day. You may be a buyer today and then decide to become a vendor tomorrow. Always keep your buyer and seller personas completely separate! Tell absolutely no one about your SR activies except trusted business partners that NEED to know. I know it&#039;s hard, but either you run a tight ship or go to jail. Need to boost your ego? Get off your ass and accomplish shit so that you have the confidence not to brag!

				Yeh, I agree, it&#039;s really the mods and vendors who have to worry about this. I mean, if you&#039;ve got thousands and thousands of posts here, surly all those little details start adding up and when you read between the lines. You don&#039;t have to openly state something for it to be obvious. If you talk enough about yourself sometimes the things you don&#039;t say start building a picture. For example, someone may go on about how their watching such and such on TV, then they say a bunch of times that they&#039;re going to the shop, then cooking etc. etc. A picture of their domestic life builds up. It soon becomes apparent they live alone, precisely because they have never mentioned someone else. All that domestic info, a wife or husband (or even roommate) has a big impact on the homelife, so the very fact that impact on their domestic life is missing from all that info suggests the person lives alone. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know? I interested in how useful our personal info is to LE, how much should we worry? There are the obvious things like, date of birth, age, address, name etc. But, important are the smaller details?

				If LE was making a profile on me based on my posts, they&#039;d know:<br /><br />I live in the USA<br />I&#039;m an adult male<br />I live alone<br />I live in the mid-high class in terms of my financial security<br />I live near the west coast<br />I live a few hours from the beach<br />I live an hour away from any major city<br /><br />However, that is based off of some of my posts.

I&#039;m pretty paranoid about this kind of thing, so I&#039;ve made it my goal to &quot;accidentally&quot; slip up and give away details which may or may not be false in my posts. I highly recommend giving several different kinds of false information in posts, just in small snippets, so LE can&#039;t build a profile for you. However, giving them information could make them waste their time trying to verify if any of the information at all is legit, while you may just be wasting their time.

				Trust me, there&#039;s shoals of red herring around here. :D<br /><br />A lot of assumptions you can make trying to profile people in real life, kinda rely on people being relatively consistent. <br /><br />This is a darknet drug forum. Fairly paranoid people. On anonymity software. On drugs. On the Internet. <br /><br />Even if we all told the the truth and &#039;nutting but da truth&#039;... Good luck with that.<br /><br />Paranoid Pine<br /><br />P.S.

I seem to remember a few years back that the author of a book entitled &quot;Primary Colors&quot; was revealed to be none other than journalist Joe Klein.&nbsp; Apparently, literary analysis by an academic had earlier fingered Mr. Klein, but he denied authorship. <br /><br />What needs to be remembered is that for such analysis to be carried out, you need two things: <br /><br />1) A large&nbsp; volume of material written by the ostensible author; and<br /><br />2) A large volume of material written by the Anonymous would-be author. <br /><br />As a journalist, Joe Klein had a huge amount of material published under his own name.&nbsp; The problem with styleometry, is that it requires a large amount of material written under your real identity, to compare the anonymous/pseudonymously authored materials to.&nbsp; <br /><br />If one is careful not to post under their real name, there is nothing identifiable to compare the anonymous/pseudonymously authored material with. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Right now? Yes, sure thing. I mean the whole concept has only come into its own with computation sorta recently as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I think there have been some decent advances in styleometry though. I&#039;ve been keeping an eye on the Drexel Group&#039;s work on styleometry evasion, and here are some numbers of where it&#039;s at these days:<br /><br />You can, if you have 50 or less suspects, ~6500 words from an author IDed source as a benchmark and only 500 words from an anonymous source, identify with a very high degree of accuracy who that person is.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m certainly not claiming you can just obtain our posts here on SRF and then compare it to every tweet and forum on the web to get results. But... certainly very powerful organizations are working very hard indeed to obtain exactly those kinds of powers. Brennan says the results can be good intelligence for a set containing 100s, even 1000s of suspects.<br /><br />My real concern is that our data is pretty much stored forever, and therefore the improvements in technology, software and hardware could eventually evolve it into a genuine threat, esp. combined with other intelligence forms. The fundamental principal of counting is the ultimate enemy. <br />Hence: paranoid pine.<br /><br />

You&#039;re right there. It&#039;s a trade off of whether you want the added value of a reputation vs more anonymity. But adversarial styleometry attacks would actually very easily reveal who all your alts are as long as you spent &gt;= 500 words on them per alt (for just the drexel group&#039;s software).<br /><br />I mean, I could easily just use something like Jstylo, and then take random samples of 50 people from the entire forum against 1 poster&#039;s text as a benchmark. Then you could just repeat that process hundreds of times until you&#039;ve processed all possible combinations of SR users in blocks of 50 within the universal set of SR members. Finally, you would collate all that data and look for the &#039;top performers&#039;. It&#039;s a bit of work, could probably be made a lot simpler, but there&#039;s nothing complicated about it conceptually that I can see.<br /><br />However, if you used Anonymouth, and modified the features for each alt, then this is impossible.<br /><br />You can&#039;t do that for the Internet, because it&#039;s fucking huge. This combinatorial algorithm grows exponentially. But on just 1 forum, it&#039;s trivial.<br /><br />Finally, editing or deleting your posts is a waste of time if the enemy is page scraping everything. Which they are unless they&#039;re bumbling idiots. In fact edits or deletions are likely to attract more attention rather than less.<br /><br />Paranoid enough yet? ;-)<br />

				^^That&#039;s one thing. For most users, giving away personal information will only be a major concern if they are already being pursued/suspected through other means. <br /><br />Say LE has a suspect, a list of potential suspects, or even a small geographical area where a known SR user resides. They can then use personal details to either narrow the search, or confirm that a real person (prior suspect) is a user on SR. All it takes is for someone to rat you out or indirectly compromise part of your anonymity. Then LE can go to a judge, show them an affidavit stating that Person X--who was identified as SR User X by a CI or some security breach--is always online when SR User X is, gave away things like age/occupation/gender/appearance during correspondence on SR that match Person X, etc. etc.... and get a warrant. Even if they don&#039;t have enough for a warrant, you can still expect to be put under heavy surveillance and harassed while driving, etc.

				One of these days when I am feeling bored - I will fill out requests for each governmental agency to see what kind of a file they have on me.&nbsp; One thing to remember, all US agencies are US bureaucracies, you can get information from all of them on what they know about you and I assume you would know more by what you don&#039;t get... I always imagine getting a memo with all but a few nouns redacted with a note&quot;redacted due to ongoing investigation&quot; or something of that nature.&nbsp; For example here the site to request info from the FBI&nbsp; http://www.fbi.gov/foia/requesting-fbi-records/

I&#039;ll see about posting a straight forward jargon free tutorial when I get a shot of free time (lol, so many projects right now), it&#039;s not as bad as it looks at first, you just have to learn some new concepts, it&#039;s cutting edge technology, and that kind of stuff very rarely has intuitive GUI designs at first. They assume you know stuff in advance. For the same reason, the implications of stylometry don&#039;t particularly worry pine at this moment in time, this is really for getting ahead of the curve in one or two years time when LE starts to thinking about using such tech as a standardized practice (interweb cops!), so I don&#039;t expect SR customers need to worry about this :D<br /><br />Any stylometry explorers are welcome to post tutorials too, the more the merrier! :)
