				Forensic Drug intelligence is a relatively old technique but has seen new usefulness with the advent of the internet and increased computing and storage power in forensic laboratories. If employed properly by law enforcement it makes court cases very compelling and all but eliminates the need for snitches. FDI is an evolution of forensic drug profiling which is defined as The use of methods to define the chemical and/or physical properties of a drug seizure for comparing seizures for intelligence (strategic and tactical) and evidential purposes.<br /><br />Following a comprehensive analysis of a drug sample obtained through seizure or purchase a comprehensive database of impurities can be generated and drawn upon in a manner akin to the DNA databases that have gained notoriety in the last 30 years. A profile is generated of (amongst other attributes) the packaging, branding, impurities , DNA profiling for samples of biological origin such as plants. This in itself is nothing new and this information has been presented in court for quite some time.<br /><br />The sophistication of databases has grown quite a bit in recent years and the ability to record this information in a meaningful way and to draw upon it.

				I think chemical IDs and signatures will added to every pill.&nbsp; It will trace back to the pharmacy And script.&nbsp; &nbsp;Crush and mix up with other pills from other regions ,&nbsp; <br /><br />just like a bitcoin tumbler.&nbsp; Tumbling pills .&nbsp; There will be some great new opportunities in the future.&nbsp; Technology creates jobs.&nbsp; Haha<br /><br />I would be worried samples from each vendor are being used to track the drugs to some degree.&nbsp; I often wonder if LE keeps this site going just to gather intel.&nbsp; If they close this site, everyone will hide underground again.&nbsp; It&#039;s beneficial to study drugs and culture.&nbsp; <br />
