				Originally posted in off-topic but decided to move the thread to Security due to the more technical savvy member base. If I was wrong in doing so I apologize and feel free to relocate.<br /><br /><br />Hi, there are some local people selling flashed mifi type devices for upwards of $120 that have unlimited data and unlimited soft limits (no decrease in speed after &#039;x&#039; amount of data).<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen one in action and it&#039;s legit. However, it just seems like I should be able to do this myself.<br /><br />Anyone know what these guys are doing? The one I&#039;ve personally seen work was for Virgin Mobile and it was flashed to Verizon towers. The seller claims it has a prog by the name of &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;phantom&quot; (can&#039;t quote remember) that allows it to surf without being detected.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but it just doesn&#039;t seem like the full story. The only thing that attracts me to this and makes me believe there is some validity to their claims is the TRUE unlimited usage, and I know a guy who has had one for over a year. He paid $130 one time and has (alleged) unlimited wifi for life.<br /><br />Any ideas? If this is legit I want to learn how to do it. Otherwise, I want to know what is really going on with these.<br /><br />Thanks!
