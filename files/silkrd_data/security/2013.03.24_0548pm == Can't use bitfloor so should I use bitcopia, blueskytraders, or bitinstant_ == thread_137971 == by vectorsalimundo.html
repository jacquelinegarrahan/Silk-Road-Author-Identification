				I had used bitinstant a lot in the past before they first took off bitcoin address option and before they got hacked. Reading recent posts I get mixed signals as to whether or not they are useable even though their bitcoin address option is available and people have reported getting bitcoin through that in the past few days. <br /><br />I can&#039;t use bitfloor because there is no BofA near here but read a few comments on bitcopia and am wondering if that is a good option to go with. I have also thought of blueskytraders based on their favorable reputation around here.<br /><br />The buying bitcoin part of this whole thing has always been changing since I started doing this a year ago and I just don&#039;t want to get stuck with my dick in my hands because I blindly went with what was best a few months ago but may not be now.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bitcopia, blueskytraders, or bitinstant?

				Bluesky is the only one out of those I have used and I haven&#039;t had one problem out of 5 transactions so far. Can&#039;t speak for the other two options, but bluesky seems like the quickest and easiest.

				Was just on bitinstant and their deliver to BTC address wasn&#039;t listed AGAIN and tried to make a cash deposit to them 2 days ago and transaction got errors both times. Wouldn&#039;t recommend dealing with them till they get their shit together.

				If you have a Wells Fargo nearby you can use Bitcopia, and you&#039;d save a little money over Bitinstant.&nbsp; By &quot;a little&quot; I mean $4, although the fee is 1% higher with Bitcopia, so if you&#039;re doing large sums, it&#039;s a wash.&nbsp; Can&#039;t give you any advice about blue sky; never used them.

				Well bluesky uses BofA as well so go with bitcopia. I&#039;ve used them 3 times and always worked perfectly. You may want to pay the small miners fee though, because confirmation TAKES forever if you don&#039;t pay the little extra.

Any caveats besides the miners fee or anything else I should know before moving forward on bitcopia? Is there a thread on here that has a good run down of the process?

				It&#039;s pretty self explanatory. At the bank, make sure not to put any of your info on the deposit slip, because it isn&#039;t required.

				I just wanted to note I ended up going with Bitcopia and couldn&#039;t have been more pleased with how it went. Very easy and smooth transaction and was able to use the drive up window at the bank to make the deposit. By far the best bitcoin buying experience I have had. I hope bitcopia sticks around.

It seems to be (mostly) run by one guy as a hobby. The buy and sell prices are a little unfair compared to the market price, but the service is very fast and easy and I&#039;m sure customer service would be fast as well. The one problem is that the owner can start and stop services at his will since everything is done manually (not that long ago, when BTC prices were being especially volatile, he temporarily shut down the site). But for the most part, it&#039;s a non-issue.
