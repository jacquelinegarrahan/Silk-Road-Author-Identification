				The following information was extracted from the Canada Post corporate website. Any other useful information will be added as found. <br /><br />1. The Context<br /><br />As Canada’s postal service, Canada Post holds a special position of trust and accountability for the mail it delivers on behalf of Canadian businesses, governments and residents. Canada Post’s operations and reputation depend on the protection of all mail in its care, whether it is being handled by Canada Post employees or by anyone else.<br /><br />The purpose of this policy is to ensure that mail deposited with Canada Post is not tampered with in any way while it is with the Corporation.<br /><br />This policy applies to all Canada Post employees and agents, especially those who accept, process, transport, deliver mail, or enter into business arrangements to do so. Employees involved in contract tendering and business arrangements with contractors that accept, process, transport, deliver mail or could have access to the mail (such as a custodian or tradesperson) must ensure that the contracts have necessary provisions and clauses for protection of the mail while it is in the care of the contractor as detailed in the &#039;Planning for Security in Contracting&#039; practice. It covers all hardcopy and electronic mail, whether this mail contains messages, information, funds or goods. This policy governs all conduct and practices associated with the handling of mail from the time it is deposited with the Corporation until it is delivered.<br /><br />Back to Top<br />2. The Policy<br /><br />Canada Post is committed to taking all measures necessary to protect mail. Employees must ensure that no one—including themselves and law enforcement authorities—tampers with (i.e., opens, keeps, steals or detains) mail from the time it is deposited with the Corporation until it is delivered.<br /><br />Employees who observe anyone tampering with the mail should promptly notify their immediate supervisor or Security &amp; Investigation Services. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal.<br /><br />Employees should always follow standard security measures for the protection of mail in their individual care. Employees involved in business arrangements with contractors that accept, process, transport or deliver mail must ensure that the contracts have necessary provisions for protection of the mail while it is in the care of the contractor. Contact Security &amp; Investigation Services for more information.<br /><br />Violation of this policy could result in removal from the workplace, suspension, termination of employment and prosecution under the law. Employees with any questions or concerns are encouraged to discuss them with their supervisor or Security &amp; Investigation Services.<br /><br />Back to Top<br />3. More about the Policy<br /><br />Back to Top<br />3.1 Investigations<br /><br />Where sufficient evidence and information is available, suspected violations of this policy will be reviewed by Security and Investigation Services (S &amp; IS).<br /><br />The Operations group or Customer Service will report all cases of violations of this policy to the National Control Center (NCC). The NCC will work with Operations to resolve these breaches and keep S&amp;IS advised of their progress. When the suspected breach is not resolved and requires follow-up, the NCC will advise S&amp;IS upon closure of their file and S&amp;IS will document and investigate/review the breach.<br /><br />Team leaders who learn of suspected violations of this policy—from employees or by any other means—must immediately notify Security &amp; Investigation Services.<br /><br />Employees suspected of being in breach of this policy will have the opportunity to explain the circumstances leading to the alleged violation, in line with standard security and investigative practices. Law enforcement agencies may be brought in / consulted when appropriate.<br /><br />Back to Top<br />3.2 Employee Confidentiality<br /><br />Team leaders and Security and Investigation Services will not disclose the identity of anyone who:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; reports a violation of this policy,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; participates in the investigation of a violation, or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; is being investigated for having violated the policy,<br /><br />unless such disclosure is essential to resolving the incident or is required by law. Any Canada Post employee to whom this information is disclosed as part of an investigation or in any other manner will also be reminded of this requirement.<br /><br />Back to Top<br />3.3 Roles and Responsibilities<br /><br />Security &amp; Investigation Services (formerly known as Corporate Security)<br /><br />Under the guidance of the Chief Postal Inspector / General Manager of Security and Investigation Services, S&amp;IS reviews breaches or potential breaches of policy, determines if sufficient evidence exists and when it does, conducts an investigation. Following the successful closure of the investigation, S&amp;IS shares the outcome of the investigation with senior management. When a criminal investigation occurs, S&amp;IS works in partnership with the local law enforcement agency to bring the matter to conclusion and will lay charges when evidence and circumstances support it. S&amp;IS also provides guidance and clarification on the policy.<br /><br />Sourcing Management<br /><br />Ensure that security requirements are included in every contract and request for proposal.<br /><br />Human Resources<br /><br />Ensure that all new employees read, understand and sign the &quot;Protection of Mail and Corporate Assets Employee Declaration form&quot; prior to the start date of hire or rehire. A copy of the signed form is maintained in the employees benefit file.<br /><br />Process Owner (budget holder)<br /><br />Ensure that the requirements of the Planning for Security in Contracting Practice are being met by contractors and sub-contractors and that security clearances are met and maintained.<br /><br />Employees and Contractors<br /><br />Employees and contractors must always follow standard security measures for the protection of the mail in their care as outlined in this policy and outlined in CMS 1605.05. They must advise Security and Investigation Services or their team leaders of any breach or suspected breach in policy.<br /><br />Back to Top<br />4. Breach of Policy<br /><br />Employees<br /><br />Failure to comply with this policy could result in removal from the workplace, suspension, termination of employment and prosecution under the law.<br /><br />Contractors / Agents<br /><br />Failure to comply with this policy could result in the termination of the contract as per contract agreement, removal from facilities and prosecution under the law.<br /><br />Employees with any questions or concerns are encouraged to discuss them with their Team Leader or Security and Investigation Services<br /><br />Criminal Code (Theft of Mail)<br />Theft from mail<br /><br />356.

				That guarantee doesn&#039;t cover priority courier because sometimes it&#039;s handed off to 3rd parties like Purolator to deliver and transport. Never use priority courier ever.<br /><br />Shipping drugs within Canada use XpressPost, or even better use regular parcel service (expedited) with tracking and no signature. Shipping outside Canada, never use XpressPost always use expedited priority tracking with no sig for large shipments, regular envelopes with no tracking and flat as possible for smaller.<br /><br /><br />
