				Hey guys, I transferred my bitcoins from My Gox to a bitcoin wallet that I downloaded from this site http://www.bitcoin.org/ about two hours ago.&nbsp; I told mt. gox to send them to the address that is listed on my wallet.&nbsp; They still haven&#039;t shown up.&nbsp; Should I be worried?

				Do you seen any uncomfirmed? MT. Gox can take a long time sometimes, but usually when i send to my wallet, it shows up as an unconfimed transaction almost immediately. Is this your first transaction? You wallet will take some time to connect to everything when you first set it up. this is most likely the issue. How many connections do you have?<br /><br />Is this your first transaction? if so, that is why its taking so long. I always recommend to download the wallet a day or so before transferring coins to it so it can do its &quot;thang&quot;...

				Yes, this is my first transaction.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed the wallet several days ago though.&nbsp; Right now it says that it has 8 connections, 1222 blocks, and 0 transactions.

				I&#039;m having this problem as we speak I just sent BC from Mt.Gox to my wallet, I was worried until I saw your post, it seems to be normal, since transferring the fund to my BC Wallet I have 3 connections and 0 transactions.<br /><br />So I guess it&#039;s just a waiting game. Hopefully we won&#039;t have to wait too long though :)

				You will need to wait for your wallet to download all the blocks.<br /><br />There are about 140000 blocks, so if your wallet says 1222 blocks you will just have to wait, but don&#039;t worry because as long as you sent coins to an address generated by your wallet, the transaction will happen. You just won&#039;t see it until your wallet has downloaded the block in which the transaction occurred.<br /><br />Keep Bitcoin running overnight.

				Did you run Tor first? Is Bitcoin set to proxy?<br /><br />I had that problem and I think that was it.

Bitcoin does not record IPs, only source and destination wallets. Better yet, do not use a local bitcoin wallet for money you&#039;ll use on the SL. go to instawallet USING TOR and create a new throwaway wallet, send the money there, then to SL. If you use TOR to go to the instawallet everytime and remember to delete your browsing history, there&#039;s no proof you were in control of the coins! after all, the wallet ID from instawallet could have belonged to just about anyone.

				If you have the bitcoin client, you can create as many throwaway addresses as you&#039;d ever want to have.<br /><br />Why would anyone use an on-line wallet?<br /><br />- Bit

				You make total sense Bit. If the bitcoins dont record ip addresses then why even put them on a installwallet? sounds like an uneeded step.
