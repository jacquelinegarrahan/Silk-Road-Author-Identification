				Ok, so I&#039;m using Sakura, which I assume is the version of Terminal for Liberte Linux, and it is not taking the password I use to log on.<br /><br />Is there something I need to do to set up a password in Sakura? Is there a set password for it? Does it depend on the command you are trying?<br /><br />I am trying the sudo get-install exiv2. The command is working, but when it asks for the password, nothing is working.<br /><br />What&#039;s going on?

				Not sure about the password for Sakura as I can use it without a password. Having said that, I have not used it recently, since I upgraded to latest version, but I can tell you that it has nothing to do with the password you created for encrypting the OTFE and use to log on. I will have a go myself and report back if you are still stuck, but I am sure it is not needed. But what is this &quot;sudo get-install exiv2&quot; you refer to?<br />If you delete the configxyz.tar file (can&#039;t remember exactly what its name is right now but it is something like that, I am using Tor Browser Bundle ATM) it is equivalent to doing&nbsp; fresh configuration install. Check out the Liberte Linux installation guide and help notes, it tells you there. You may have inadvertently screwed something up!<br />You using Windows or Linux or what?&nbsp; And if you don&#039;t mind me asking, why do you want to use Sakura? Just curious! No need to answerer last question :)<br />

				I am using Liberete Linux on a flash drive. I was trying to use Sakura to get to the meta data editing prog. supposedly you can enter the command sudo apt- get install exiv2 and it will set up the prog (forget exact name).<br /><br />I did have to enter two different passwords at first, and it&#039;s possible I screwed up the second one. Does backspace work when setting up the passwords? I did a typo and backspaced, but I couldn&#039;t tell if it worked because you can&#039;t see the cursor move.<br /><br />Anyhow, when I attempt that command, it asks for a password, of which I do not know.

				I think I see what the problem might be, but still haven&#039;t gone back to my Liberte Linux, so you might have to check out what I say against the installation notes. The sudo command is super user I believe, and that requires that you use a special password which is already setup for you, I think it is &quot;Liberte&quot; or something like that. It tells you in the user guide notes.&nbsp; I am not sure about the backspace, but if you can log in you should be alright. I think I gave the same password when asked on the install, but you only ever need one to login. Except for the password mentioned above. Just to clarify, it is not Sakura that wants the password, it is the sudo (super-user) command. As I say, you should be able to find this in the guide notes.<br />If you get really stuck you can always reinstall the whole lot from scratch. Just extract the files to the flash drive and start over. Please let me know how you get on ,

				I&#039;ve already tried Liberte. I will look through the guide notes and see what I can find. <br /><br />To clarify, this is supposed to &quot;install&quot; the program that removes meta data from pictures, called jarhead, I believe.

				I think you will find&nbsp; that the &quot;jarhead&quot; program or whatever it is called is to be found on Ubuntu and other ordinary Linux distributions, not the cut down Liberte version. When I have got some more time I will try and look into it for you. Unless you can find it and download it and then put it one the flash drive. I do not see you are ging to be able to use it. But have you got the Sakura application going without having to use a password? having said that, I suppose it is irrelevant if you cant find the &quot;jarhead&quot; in the first place.
