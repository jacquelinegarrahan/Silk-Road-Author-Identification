				HI ,,had a problem with a cash deposit to intersango through Lloyd s bank in Uk i made the deposit two days ago ,, after 24 hours i filled a support ticket to intersango asking how long before the funds are credited to the account,, A guy from Intersango called Patrick mailed me back 24 hours later telling me that Lloyds had made a correcting entry , After i mailed again to explain he told me it means that Lloyds have taken the money back from Intersangos account and Intersango tells me that no funds will be credited to my Intersango account ,,,which now leaves me a certain amount of monies short ,,,, I have just mailed Intersango back for them to explain how and why they could do this as it was a cash deposit ,, &quot;guaranteed payment&quot; ,,So what do i do ,, just wait and see if Intersango advise me ,, or,, go back to Lloyds on Monday and ask them for my money back ??will they give me it ,, will they hold an investigation ? will they inform the Law will they want my address ? ?,, to these questions i don&#039;t know ,, but untill i do ,i would not advise anybody depositing money into Lloyds&nbsp; i will update on what happens at a later date ,, maybe sometime on Monday,,,,,,,,

				Patrick is pretty cool kat!&nbsp; i would catch him on skype (there is a link in the support tab) and talk to him there and see what you should do.&nbsp; Not sure I would mention SR to him but thats up to you.&nbsp; Buying coins is not illegal
