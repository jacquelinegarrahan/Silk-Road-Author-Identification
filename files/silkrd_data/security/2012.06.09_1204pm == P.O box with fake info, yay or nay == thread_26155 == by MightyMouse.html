				My opinion would be if you&#039;re getting smaller amounts, for personal use, you&#039;re better off getting a PO box with real information. If you&#039;re getting larger amounts that you would surely be investigated and prosecuted for if they were found, then you&#039;re better off getting a PO box with fake information.<br /><br />If a small amount for personal use was seized, it isn&#039;t likely they will pursue you, the buyer, and if they did the penalty wouldn&#039;t be nearly as harsh as if you had a fake PO box setup which also kills any plausible deniability claim you could have made.

				Wouldn&#039;t a drop be safer? Even if you were caught getting the mail you could claim that you were stealing it but if caught getting the mail from the PO box you&#039;re only adding more charges (fraud). <br /><br />There are usually a lot of potential drops if you just look for them. If you&#039;re trying to move a lot of weight you can have smaller amounts sent to various different drops. If you&#039;re caught at one drop you&#039;re not going to get the same possession charge as if you were caught with all of the drug at a single location. <br /><br />This is just my opinion, feel free to correct me if you think I&#039;m wrong.

Of course it is intuitive to think that if they have the address and want the person they will get them from doing manned surveillance, but in practice I have seen that this is not always how things work out for them. The tracking says something about it being intercepted or other suspicious things, everyone in the group order is raided and the people with fake ID boxes just don&#039;t go to pick up. Also there are of course other benefits, it is no longer a game of recording addresses on the outgoing mail of a single person who is under surveillance, but becomes a game of putting all of these widely distributed points under manned surveillance waiting for people to pick up packages, the difference in cost between these two sorts of operation is enormous when you consider a vendor serving a customer base of a hundred people. It is the difference between a single agency actively pursuing that vendor and dozens of agencies cooperating to actively pursue the entire network. It also has the added benefit of being able to ditch the box after the vendor you work with is busted or starts acting suspiciously, not having a history of a hundred random packages from all over coming to your home address. Not to mention you are no longer worried about being blackmailed with your address if you work with the wrong person. What if you decide to start vending later and one of the vendors you worked with turns out to be a fed, it is the difference between them knowing who you are and them knowing a box that you used once that they never bothered to put under surveillance. <br /><br />I personally think that people writing off fake ID boxes have unrealistic expectations about the plausible deniability that they have, if you accept a package of drugs and open it and are raided half an hour later you are going to be charged for possession of those drugs and no story you make up about how you had no idea drugs were coming to you is going to do shit to protect you.

				For small amounts, I would use a PO box (and probably with real info, lacking of fake ID). Not so much to protect myself from LE, rather to not disclose my home address to sellers. Most vendors are good professional people, but you never know who&#039;s who, and you&#039;re still dealing with drug dealers (which is not necessarily a profession I frown upon, but we have seen certain behavior in the past...) .<br /><br />For large amounts, I would avoid using the mail altogether. Because when a large amount is intercepted, they know it&#039;s not for personal use, and then it&#039;s a lot more likely that they go after the buyer. Instead, I would consider a drop off location.

The only way around this is having shipments sent with interception detection technology that you can remotely query to see if the package has been opened on the route between the sender and your box. You still have the added advantage of making it more expensive for them to bust you, it is the difference between them knowing your address and them having to wait for you to pick up a package. Assuming a cost difference of even only one thousand dollars (which is a reasonable estimate for the man hours it would take to do surveillance for the time it takes you to pick up your package after it arrives) this quickly adds up if a thousand people are using fake ID boxes (to be exact, the cost of identifying all of them would increase by one million dollars). The cost of identifying one thousand people who are not using fake ID boxes is pretty close to zero dollars, assuming they can get the shipping information, which is assumed in either case. An increase in cost of a million dollars is significant, although a drop in the bucket for government it seems far less likely for them to spend a million dollars to identify 1,000 people ordering small amounts of drugs than it is for them to spend zero dollars to identify 1,000 people ordering small amounts of drugs. <br /><br />Also, you have the other added advantages that I mentioned earlier in this thread. The only disadvantage is that you are breaking several other laws by opening such a box. Well, if you use out of state ID you may be opening yourself up to intelligence attacks.
