			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve been looking to do an instant order USD-BTC exchange...<br /><br />Everything has been down or out of coin for days now... BitInstant, CoinMama, BTC Brokers, Coinbase, BlueSkyTraders are not options for me either because they are a) out of coin b) website down for restructuring or c) require &quot;validation&quot; processes that can take a whole week to actually go through and receive your coins... None of these are options for me.<br /><br />I also cannot use Chase or Wells Fargo.... they&#039;re not around my location. <br /><br />There used to be a site called get-bitcoin.com, but it appears they are no longer in operation...<br /><br />So where does this leave me? I don&#039;t have a credit card either, I&#039;m preferably looking for cash deposits at MoneyGram locations or cash deposits at banks (just not Wells Fargo or Chase)...&nbsp; Any ideas guys? I know there&#039;s gotta be a few more BTC Exchange services out there that I&#039;ve overlooked. Again the only stipulation is I have a turn-around time of several hours or less (aka &quot;instant&quot; transactions), I cannot wait several days/ a week for my coins to show up.<br /><br />Any help whatsoever is greatly appreciated... I&#039;ve been trying to obtain coin for 5 days now, still no luck.<br /><br />Thanks guys

				I tried...<br /><br />The only thing that comes up for &quot;BTC&quot; is my thread.<br /><br />What search terms would you recommend putting in there?<br /><br />The search feature seems kinda wonky
