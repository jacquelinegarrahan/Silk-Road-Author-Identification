				Hello silkroad anybody here know anything about encrypting your entire harddrive so no one can get to your files? i was also really wondering if once you encrypt your entire computer is there any negative effects from this will your computer act diffrently can it be undone or what is the whole sha -bang with this?

				Yeh read this for instructions: http://2po5jdzeffv2kyv3.onion/polyfront/wintruefield.html<br /><br />Ideally you want a &#039;clean&#039; os with a dirty installation you use for anything of legal uncertainty. You would need to use the clean os as much&nbsp; as possible for plausible deniability. However, this might not be practicle due to hd size or the amount you want to use the dirty os. In this case you can encrypt the os hd without a hidden os. Use a password 20+ characters which are random (no words), contains capitals, numbers and preferably symbols. Keep this password in your head and NOWHERE ELSE - don&#039;t even write it down once.<br /><br />Yes this can be&nbsp; undone fairly easily using truecrypt. Your computer will take longer to boot from hibernation (it has to decrypt a large file). It may cause a slight slowing of performance but in my experience that&#039;s not too bad. You should also work out whether it&#039;s illegal to withhold encryption keys in your local jurisdiction - it will not keep you out of jail if it is but it will probably protect other people (by not revealing their details - crucial if you are vendor) and make it harder to prosecute you on the crime which they think you are guilty of.

				Not revealing your encryption keys to LE in the UK is illegal and punishable under the Regulations of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which carries a maximum sentence of 2 years. Which is probably a lot shorter than if you was to give them your keys and find out that you have been; drug dealing, money laundering, arms trader etc....

Note that TrueCrypt does not modify the file system (information about free space, etc.) within the outer volume in any way.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />When you create a truecrypt volume, (even if you encrypt your entire HD, truecrypt considers this a volume) it encrypts the entire volume, including free space. When you create another hidden volume within a truecrypt volume, it&#039;s just more random data. Truecrypt volumes do not have any sort of signature. It&#039;s completely random data from start to end. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish the random data that is a hidden truecrypt volume from random data that&#039;s just free space.

				Since the fact that Truecrypt can create a hidden volume within an outer volume is well known, it concerns me that LE may eventually come to demand two passwords to your Truecrypt volume.&nbsp; If you reveal the password to the outer volume and LE doesn&#039;t find what they&#039;re looking for, what&#039;s to keep them from detaining you on the charge that you have not fully complied when asked to reveal a password?&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s common knowledge that a Truecrypt volume can have two passwords, and given this fact I wonder how well the concept of &quot;plausible deniability&quot; would hold up. <br /><br />There are many cases of people being convicted for failure to reveal their Truecrypt password.&nbsp; As LE encounters more Truecrypt volumes I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if we see people charged, and perhaps convicted, on the claim that there was a second password that the accused would not reveal.

				An excellent point Frank,<br /><br />Plausible deniability needs to be seen as a final &quot;layer&quot; of your security.<br /><br />Obviously your first defence lies in your discretion and anonymity. You&#039;re not ostentatious and don&#039;t visibly break the law.<br /><br />Your online activities are (hopefully) Torified and I would hope you all encrypt any personally identifying information with GPG.<br /><br />The Police would obviously need to arrest you for a chargeable offence or obtain a search warrant from a J.P in order to discover you had a machine containing encrypted data before they can require you to hand over your keys.<br /><br />If you do employ Plausible denial encryption, I would suggest you refuse to comment during interview and ask to see your Solicitor privately. Give them the &quot;safe&quot; password and have them prepare a written statement saying that you wish to surrender it to the Police and that you refuse to answer any further questions. Your Legal Adviser can read this out for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;If they start trying to press you about a second password, your Solicitor will then remind them that you have already entered a statement into the record. If the case comes to trial it will be much more difficult for adverse inferences to be drawn from your silence as you&#039;ll be able to present a defence entirely consistent with your original statement.<br /><br />I saw comments earlier saying it was easy to tell the difference between a Truecrypt container with a hidden volume and one without. <br /><br />While it is possible that a hidden Operating System can leak information, the same is not true of a Truecrypt container. As far as I know, short of bruteforcing a container on the offchance there&#039;s a hidden volume there is no way to prove its existence.<br /><br />News articles of people who have been found guilty of breaching RIPA by refusing to hand a password to the Police:<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-11479831<br /><br />https://blog.ironkey.com/?p=842<br /><br />http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2007/11/385589.html<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23330.msg243941#msg243941">Quote from: frank-butcher24 on May 16, 2012, 07:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I believe Vladimir said in another thread recently that he knows of 3 cases where people have been convicted for a year.
