				I am new here, but I was wondering - say that some of the sellers here were actually undercover DEA agents? What tools could I use to keep my identity secret from them, assuming they are? Is their any way I could remain protected even if they know the address I got the package shipped to?

And never assume that someone won&#039;t see that unencrypted message in their inbox. I mean imagine you send your shipping address via the internet and your ISP has been ordered to sniff your ports for incoming data. Idk how plausible it is within the tor network but it&#039;s better safe then sorry.

				Some people say that opening a PO box under an alias is a good strategy to remain completely anonymous but from what I understand this is no easy task. There is really no way to know for sure who is on the other end of the equation so if you have any suspicion that a vendor is LE, avoid them even if their offers seem tempting. By referring to the forums and relying on reviews from trusted members, you can pretty much ensure that you&#039;ll find a vendor who will come through for you without having to worry about the boys in blue.

				My thought is that they are not even going to bother trying to break the system. They will just start collecting addresses by posing as sellers, and then come knocking on the doors of all of the people their agents sold to.<br /><br />Would it be possible to pull off a plausible deniability defense? In other words, &quot;Oh my god, you mean that someone was shipping drugs to my house? How awful!&quot;<br /><br />How would one go about making this plausible, assuming the ransack your house and confiscate your computers?

Stating that articles you read show that the tor network routes signals from computers everywhere. State you have had a virus on your pc for awhile now and that somebody probably routed through your pc while also obtaining your personal information. <br /><br />*Being sure to become increasingly outraged, but not fully BULL yet, as you become outraged at the thought of DRUGS coming to YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD!*<br /><br />Finish with a statement that demands the police find out who shipped garbage to your house and that they go do their job somewhere that doesn&#039;t raise your blood pressure.<br /><br />While very hypothetical it was only something I just whipped up. Since they cannot enter your premises without a warrant, do not allow them inside, do not allow the office to step foot into your apt. As soon as you allow his foot to cross the threshold, any physical attempt to cease the office, even a hand on the shoulder, will become probable cause and a dislocated shoulder.<br /><br />If he has a warrant I feel there is a defense against this I have read about. Something about demanding an unopened and sealed letter from the court. Similar to the undercover cop pulling you over defense. If an undercover cop car pulls you over you can demand that they send a marked car, for your safety. If they question you, you say &quot;You have the uniform and the badge and all the lights, but that doesn&#039;t mean you are really a cop.&quot; Say you have too many movies where people get pulled over by fake cops and killed/raped/tortured and they will call in back up. Since you have pleaded your case and it is now on video/audio (if the car was retrofitted for it) they cannot ask you to leave your car. Just roll up your window, turn your car off and hopefully the cop will go chill in ur car while you very stealthy swallow some shit.<br /><br />Having tor installed, having web addresses bookmarked, are all indicators that you did in fact order the package. <br /><br />But not direct evidence, a case could be built but don&#039;t count on a lawyer to win you the case, it will be more money then you have more then likely.<br /><br />You have a deniable case but if you purchased those bitcoins via bank transfer or at your most local of banks then you can consider yourself caught. They will begin to contact web owner after web owner, subpoenaing records of your guiltiness. Hopefully the trail ends at one or two layers of instawallets but even then I am unsure how much data tor inadvertently stores on the HDD and how much of it could be used to link to you anonymous connections. It begins to lose it&#039;s anonymity if say tor kept some silly back log somewhere of all the ip&#039;s you were routed through, or even one!<br />

				I get the impression&nbsp; that there must be vendor/dea&#039;s farming data in whatever way they can, to store, log and eventually use to pinch. <br /><br />In my opinion even sellers that look really good, leave lots of personal info on their page (such as what&#039;s goin on with them, what they&#039;ve been up to etc... who does that?!), could easily be an &quot;active&quot; seller as well as not on the side of the free sr community. <br /><br />What does everyone think? Anyone get slightly interesting pm&#039;s? Any vendors get special requests that could be for whoever is seeking to log/collect/investigate the specific sender data and close in on you??<br /><br />I think this could definitely be happening. <br /><br />

				Yes, it could be happening.&nbsp; And someone has just made the allegation that &quot;thecloser29&quot; (recent scammy vendor)&nbsp; was one of the people indicted.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19157.60

				Well just remember folks. <br /><br />If it&#039;s a large amount of drugs of a felony amount they would be motivated to chase after, then don&#039;t keep it in your house.<br /><br />If they come knocking at your door, about past orders just say<br /><br />&quot;I never bought any drugs. I never owned any drugs. I never seen any drugs. Then close the door. Be very polite. If they have a warrant, they would not have knocked.&quot;<br /><br />They can have all the past evidence they want on you but if they can&#039;t catch you in the act with it in your possession, they can&#039;t do anything about it. But if it gets to this point, you may want to change up your game on what you order, how you do it, to where, etc. <br /><br />But after that happens, you may want to change the manner in which
