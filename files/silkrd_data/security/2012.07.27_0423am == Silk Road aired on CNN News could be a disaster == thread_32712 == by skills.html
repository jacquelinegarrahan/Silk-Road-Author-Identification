				I think you all might have read about:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32687.0<br /><br /><br />What can result from here, is being discussed but really, no one knows even if this will be a good or bad thing to SR.<br /><br />Even though the admins from this place might want to have more sellers i do believe that this place will attract more buyers than sellers, the demand will be GIGANTIC... post mails will flood with droogs and might become a threat to the public health (they say)<br /><br />Surely sellers will sell more and more, but prepare to ask for early finalization (Screwing some good people in the middle but hey, it&#039;s life) lol, as this might get some junkies and Kiddies looking for a thrill (millions of them). my left ear is burning<br /><br />And you admins, might as well have a crew (A big one) on the resolution centers taking care of the discussions AND loose the service quality.<br /><br />I STRONGLY advice you to adopt an INVITATION only access system (like the first biggest TORRENT websites did) and control the becoming flooding lol. I wold invite all my friends and teach them how to use this marvelous way to reach some happiness<br /><br />or probably im a bit high and this makes no sense. in this case, gimme some negative jarma (don&#039;t..)<br />

				What if this is the only way for someone to get their medicine? A reliable vendor has something that that person needs and wouldn&#039;t have access to it because the admins said, NO MORE USERS... Apparently upwards of a thousand dispensaries are closing in cali. People need access to things like this. If you take the time to create the account and get the coins and risk your freedom, then you should be allowed here. But freedom comes with responsibility. The kiddies can be weeded out. Junkies are gonna get it no matter what so why not help them out with a little harm reduction. I&#039;m not in favor of shutting down access. Thats terrible! I love this community and am glad to be a part of it. and ivitation only? Hows that gonna work... you give out invites to the hero members and mods... let them decide who gets access? They would have to push access onto others and talk about it to even hand them out. Then you&#039;d have a bunch of angsty teens bickering over invites and no one would get anywhere. The SR isn&#039;t going anywhere. Don&#039;t let the media cloud your judgement and scare you with their lies and coverage. Be proud of who you are and stand up for what you believe in.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t rely on this website to get my stuff mate :P, it really is a good way to get it conveniently and a little bit cheaper (Will never be a problem in Portugal get these stuff)<br /><br />This will be a problem, believe me. Invitations would work better taking in account that to have one you would need to search for it, or simply be invited (When you &quot;invite&quot; someone, they will take more care of the place, than if they just got in for themselves). <br /><br />The growth would happen any way my friend :), the difference would be on how fast it would.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think&nbsp; that Dread Pirate Roberts will even read this, but there can be no good in having thousands of visitors at one time (Server will crash more likely), precautions at least need to be taken. <br /><br />--&gt; About the invitations, any registered user Could get 10 INvitations, and spread the word, the new 10 ones that probably know what a drug is (if you know what i mean here) would send another 10, and voil√°, on the second row of sent invitations you have 100 guests&nbsp; and if those 100 deliver 10 each (or they might even sell them, parallel economy) and it&#039;s a 1000 members now!!! WOW :D . What if the chain breaks? Give the regular users even more invites to send!\~~~ <br /><br /><br />If you have a controlled access there is time to Educate the people that come by.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32712.msg372173#msg372173">Quote from: mdmamail on July 27, 2012, 04:54 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Uhm, this site has already been in the news countless times already where have you been<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not on a national channel my friend, not in this type of media and in a channel with this dimension :).

				SR has been preparing for the waves of new customers it will be receiving, like they say &quot;any press is good press.&quot; Remember the more people using SR the harder it is to shutdown because if you read the shutdown of TFM it was I believe only six people running the site and were accepting all types of clearnet payments. Now take SR and you have hundreds of vendors from around the world using PGP, BTC, Tumblers/Mixers, etc and it&#039;s going to take LE a ton of money/manpower to even make a dent in SR and I highly doubt they&#039;ll even try because it&#039;s not really worth their time.

				I have seen the whole media attention scare here before<br />and I have also seen quite a few debates about resticting access to the road in various ways.<br /><br />I understand and respect why DPR wants this place to be an open community. and I also understand the fears of having a bunch of newbs rush on board (I can&#039;t think of a single day where I don&#039;t see at least one first time poster making a whole slew of fuck ups)<br /><br />I think that a good compromise would be to put a pgp test in the account registration. where it gives you a public key and a captcha and has you type the captcha message in to a note and encrypt it for the key.

				I honestly don&#039;t understand why people think that invitations would be beneficial.&nbsp; Do people think that invitations would stop LE gaining access to the site?&nbsp; Or is it more a case of limiting growth, with the presumption that a smaller userbase is less likely to draw the attention of the scary men with all the power?

				Yet another invitation-thread... ^^ I think there has been countless over the time i&#039;m here.<br />I don&#039;t like the idea of creating a &#039;elite&quot; or &#039;invited&#039; people community out of SR, I also don&#039;t like to creat a two-level access area (even if i got your point guru and it&#039;s a truly great idea to have a proof that someone can use pgp,but that doesn&#039;t change the mind of any person or even doesn&#039;t allow someone to have more privileges than someone other imo).<br />We are all here and we want to be threaten equally (ok, there is a vendor exclusive forum, but it&#039;s there for its&#039; reasons and not to split the community, the &quot;two classes&quot; of buyer and vendor should be clear for everyone here ;) ) and in my opinion an invite system can change this. We all love to have our information for free and we all like/love that we could join SR for free, w/o any invitation, but just with some free information we could find on the web or got by a talking with someone we trust. So why change that system?<br />Besides that points, SR tries to be a revolution (or even is said to be one... ;) ). So just imagine: &#039;There would be a revolution, but you have no invite&#039; ... sounds like a big fail to me.<br />So there will be a gigantic flood of newbs and perhaps the resolution center would take (in a bad bad, or very well case) about 1 month, would that really change something? If you&#039;re an established and honest buyer or a trusted vendor, you wouldn&#039;t even notice that change, because you&#039;ll never see a fucking resolution center ;)<br />Hopefully SR won&#039;t change the join politic and i&#039;m pretty sure they won&#039;t :)

Initial access would not require a PGP key to be submitted. However in order to increase one&#039;s level of access, one should be required to submit a proper PGP key, and correctly respond to an automated challenge. <br /><br />In other words, once a prospective user submits a PGP key, the system generates a randomly-generated challenge string, and encrypts it with the users&#039; PGP public key. The user is presented with the encrypted challenge.&nbsp; In order for the system to raise their level of access, the user must decrypt the challenge, and submit the challenge string to the system. If the string matches, then the user has demonstrated that they have at least mastered the rudiments of PGP. <br /><br />What do other people think of this idea? <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I like Guru approach. and i also think that SR should have vendors use PGP. i have noticed that some do not. me personally i do not buy from anyone who doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />This is an open market, and it being on the darkweb it will always get attention from LE. but this is why vendors pay fees, and the reason why SR has a team. It is to make the necessary improvements to keep SR safe as well as us and the vendors. I have been on hear since the first gawker story. it took me a while till to purchase because i wanted to be safe. smart people will do that same. i didnt know jack shit, and a year+ later im still here enjoy all of its delites. SR is here to stay. Trust me. let it get its attention. it means a bigger community. <br /><br />Also i have seen so many changes since i have been here. there was no hedging. btc prices went up to 30 bucks in matter of days. and would fluctuate not cents but dollars in mins. SR put hedging. then people started getting concerned about wallets and sending money to SR and vendors taking their money out, SR solution a mixer. we have a new look, this forum was put in later. the former forums was in SR. the new FE rule because of scamming. they also put a capta when logging in. the sign in page was totally different. all these changes SR has made for the people of SR. do not think the CNN is a negative. think it has a change for the better, think of the new vendors (hopefully trust worthy) we will see with new strains, hopefully better prices, etc. SR is here to stay. keep buying, keep being smart and safe.

				My biggest fear about a story on a major news network like CNN is the inevitable &quot;YOUR CHILDREN CAN BUY DRUGS ON THE INTERNET&quot; spin they will put on it. It&#039;s not like the old people watching CNN are going to be the only ones who see the story. Once it&#039;s on national TV it&#039;s going to spread like wildfire. People love to get offended, and they will eat this story up. That&#039;s going to mean way more traffic, way more negative attention and way more of our tax dollars being wasted in the effort to land us all in prison. <br /><br />That said, I love the PGP test idea. Kids are going to get on here no matter what, and so are &quot;adults&quot; who never quite grew up. I think this would provide a very effective filter at keeping away the idiots who would upload pictures of their purchases on facebook. <br /><br />I know for an absolute fact that if the average teenager/thug moron saw <br /><br />&quot;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)<br /><br />sajhdjs#RUHiufndsxoJEAIiQjtnt/olmpYIAIAh9rDphz9MMHPR9Y+273yN<br />mRcBi5Smj4NMu6pU37jQlNZ/NEVlU41Qmmp80emGTSpVyLlljzTBg04d15NKQITw<br />ByidPFbh2QadskhjfkjHFKJJKSHDJSA3234298589fdHJKFJAFd821ybmxYZYnwpErx+pcsrE+0ic<br />j4MInxn6ASLkhjslafhjfncvmxz5743skdafhjfsdafsdanfKJSFHHJASHioweufhdsavcnoe<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----&quot;<br /><br />on their screen, their brains would short circuit and they would give up without even attempting to figure out what it means.

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t trust _any_ super seekrit elite board of traffickers and carders. Every single one of them has been busted before. All those carding sites that require 5 vouch members and $200+ to get in are already full of informants and cops since day #1. <br /><br />Same goes for any secret SR vendors forum. Sounds like it would be full of investigators since they&#039;d definitely want access there and not to waste time here. Everybody who posts there would be a major vendor. This site was open to the public and prob full of informants since day #1 as well, better to have everything in the open and secure than hidden with security through obscurity imho.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;You&#039;re crazy if you don&#039;t think $500-2k of bitcoins won&#039;t buy you access to anywhere on the internet no matter what vouching or security nonsense they claim. Bribery has worked forever for LE and informants. I bought access to the &#039;hidden elite&#039; area of a major German fraud forum years ago because some guy was retiring and had free access there through epic sales, so sold it to me for $500 to use his account. I showed up already respected, vouched and ready for business and could&#039;ve been an informant. Good thing I never bought anything there except bot software to run on anonymous servers it was busted eventually anyways. The point is for some money and a simple PM on a different board, I got in. If I can cops can. Security through obscurity. <br /><br />When I was on there people were loose lipped and fingered like they always are in these hidden types of boards and chatrooms. They think it&#039;s secure so they act insecure. The first post I saw was a guy offering to trade off ipads he no longer wanted because he was getting a bunch of new one&#039;s. Vendors posting their drop addresses to each other it was amazingly insecure. Fill the ipad with tracking devices and aidsware, get local cops to follow the drop pickup guy. That&#039;s how cha0 a POS skimmer vendor was busted from gifts from seemingly vouched members. Wonder how many US vendors here trade with each other, prob quite a few. &quot;Hey I don&#039;t need this pill press anymore, who wants it free? I have new one&#039;s. Comes with complimentary GPS tracking you&#039;ll never be able to find hidden in it&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Frankly, I think the OP takes an unnecessarily alarmist tone.<br /><br />Fact is this: Silk Road is a good thing for the world.&nbsp; It allows a safe, open market for drugs that is secure and, most importantly, free.<br /><br />To limit access, regardless of what attention we get (and everyone remembers the Gawker article), would go against the principles of Silk Road.<br /><br />Will there be more buyers?&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; Good for them.&nbsp; It helps our strong community of sellers to earn more money.&nbsp; Besides, sellers aren&#039;t being forced to take orders from suspicious new customers.<br /><br />As long as the Road lives securely,&nbsp; then allow it to flourish and grow.&nbsp; We need to worry about LE, not media.

My guess is that we&#039;ll see different offshoots of SR like the ones that may or may not exist today, with some more clandestine than others. As long as bitcoin and tor remain reasonably secure, this style of open drug market isn&#039;t going away. I just hope that &#039;home base&#039; can hold out long enough for others to build similar, functional e-bazars complete with escrow. Who knows? Perhaps there are already plans underway to build several backup Silk Roads? Sigh.. I guess time will tell.

LEO&#039;s take the job serious and this is prolly the best notch on the belt to have you as the one to take down SR. I never post anything taunting. People get cocky and then careless.

				I&#039;m going to join the people asking for invite-only status, Just because you&#039;re not supposed to talk about Fight Club doesn&#039;t mean people won&#039;t find us, but it would significantly stem the flood that will surely come from this. There can be no doubt, CNN targets the lowest denominator of the general public. They will bring a bad tide to this place. This can be guaranteed.

				I&#039;ll add my voice to the side against invite-only system.&nbsp; Think of all the people out there who are loners who would never know how to find somebody to give them an invite.&nbsp; You would have people pleading for them on clearnet sites where they would be putting themselves at major risk (counter-intel calls this &quot;pre-operational surveillance&quot; when it&#039;s performed by terrorists, and they are good at detecting it).&nbsp; That feels like it would be against the goals SR was built upon.

Are you insinuating it takes any more than a 6th grade education level to access the market or the forum? Security is paramount to convenience in my opinion.

				so long as we are all cautious, sellers check new buyers stats etc and nobody gives out their personal info, there should be little to worry about i would think. we do need to figure something out, but i&#039;ll leave that to DPR and his crew.&nbsp; btw, is there a fund/wallet to donate to the SR crew?
