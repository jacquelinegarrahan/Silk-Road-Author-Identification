				I would proceed cautiously with MP vendors. I have been on the road for a about a year and have bought more BTC&nbsp; then most here. This is my first time getting robbed and it was because I was in pinch. GGGATZ had great reviews when order placed. <br /><br />And dont even consider GGATZ- he got me for 500.&nbsp; He is what is wrong with Silk road. <br /><br />SR needs to set up an escrow system for currency exchange if the are going to continue to allow BTC sales.

				What kind of rate would you charge, and how long does that usually take to transfer? I&#039;ve gotten them in less than half an hour before. It&#039;s a 100 dollar moneypak. Is that too small to even mess with Silo?

				I am mystified by Sugar Mama&#039;s continued absence, she was the one vendor I wouldn&#039;t hesitate for a second in recommending. Her SR profile page is still up just as she left it in early May, and she shows to be still in stealth mode.<br /><br />Anybody know anything concrete about her?

				By using those listings you&#039;re willingly choosing to forego the silk road escrow system. Technically you&#039;re supposed to buy/put a deposit on a vendor account and put a listing up for the moneypak.

				I think the risks involved with such transactions are pretty obvious.. however if one is not smart enough to realize that.. they deserve whats coming. I listed the vendors I have done successful trans with no issues however one day they might just decide they are done and just keep your MP. A currency exchange would be a great feature for the road however it will only add more complication and problems. I very much so appreciate the vendors I have done successful business with so far and hope they keep up the awesome work!

				I held onto the moneypak with patience for two days and finally was able to get a meet face to face with a guy from localbitcoins.com and buy my bitcoin face to face. Patience is a virtue that i don&#039;t normally posess, but by excercising it with this situation it literally payed off. Who knows, i could have gotten ripped off. It was just a 100 dollar moneypak, but it was my hard-earned money. Thanks all for the great advice.
