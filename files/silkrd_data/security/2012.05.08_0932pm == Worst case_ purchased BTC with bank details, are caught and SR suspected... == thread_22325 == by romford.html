				OK so you get caught and they suspect SR, they know you bought BTC as you used a wired transfer of funds to an exchange (stupid noob mistake which won&#039;t happen again), but you did put it through the fog before it got to SR so hopefully with a combination of the two the destination cannot be found. There is no trace of any accounts on your computer because you were sensible enough to encrypt or destroy everything. If they do ask where the coins went, what would you say? You can&#039;t really lie as they could check the other end of where you said couldn&#039;t they? Is it a straight denial or is there a better way that could be seen as legitimate? Interested in peoples thoughts.

				The beautiful thing is you dont HAVE to tell them anything.<br /><br />Just look at them with a blank stare, and ask if you are under arrest, and if not are you free to go. That is all you need to say. Dont be a dick.

				So what if you buy BTC? Proves nothing.<br /><br />People buy BTC to invest.<br /><br />Like any kind of &#039;share&#039; in a way.<br /><br />I would not buy too many BTC using my own bank but its is not illegal to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about it.

				Yes, Bitcoins were not invented to purchase drugs via SR on the Tor. It is not illegal. Further, the magic of the Bitcoins, is they&#039;re untraceable. Unlike the dollar. But here, we&#039;re back to Bitcoin 101. There is no provable, undeniable way to trace a funding from your bank all the way (if your doing the smart way(s) to SR). And if they do find a way, then as someone else mentioned, &quot;I&#039;m sorry,&nbsp; Mr. Police man, I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about&quot; &quot;Am I under arrest? If not, I&#039;d like a lawyer please&quot; and then you STFU.<br /><br />People purchase Bitcoins to play games which require immediate virtual payment, people also buy to invest in a virtual currency/bank-free world. People buy Bitcoins just to piss of the Man. People purchase Bitcoins to legally gambling with Bitcoins, hell, I&#039;m sure quite a bit of Bitcoins are used for World of Warcraft. *snicker.*<br /><br />

There are perfectly legitimate uses for BTC and indeed I receive and buy large quantities of these to offer legitimate investment opportunities/or play games.<br /><br />As Jordan says, if you were then asked about this, you have the right to remain silent, so plead the Fifth and don&#039;t incriminate yourself further. Nothing you can say about BTC could help you in any case.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t say anything. Let them waste their time and energy and minutes that they could have used jacking off or eating cake before they died talking at what may as well be a wall. Don&#039;t even expend the energy to think of anything to come back at them with, just ask if you are under arrest and if they say yes then ask for a solicitor/lawyer/whatever you call that clever Trevor and then just sit still and think about what you want you have in the freezer that you can have for dinner that evening.<br /><br />Job done.

They have to prove all charges against you, don&#039;t help them, don&#039;t say dick until you have a lawyer present. Never admit anything for whatever promises they make before your lawyer gets there. Any words can be used against you and boy will they use it.<br />
