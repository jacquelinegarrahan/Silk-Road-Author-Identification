				I plan on using LocalBitcoins soon but my $$$ will not be in hand until Saturday. I have seen fair deals for depositing cash into bank accounts for BitCoins but most banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday.<br />I would try LocalBitcoin in-person trades but I have nobody near where I am right now.<br /><br />So, what quick and/or dependable methods have you used to turn cash into BitCoins during the weekend?<br />I see one or two sellers with reasonable prices for payment via MoneyPak. Anyone used MoneyPak on LocalBitcoins?<br /><br /><br />(I am planning a party for next weekend, so I was hoping to order everything soon enough to arrive before then but... do things ever go to plan when time is a factor? :P)

Its a very simple and easy transaction. <br /><br />You can also use Coinbase to purchase bitcoins over the weekend, though its not anonymous at all. Also if your account is new or you havent verified your phone number, they make you wait for your coin (2 weeks, was it?) If you do end up using this method, passing your coins through BitcoinFog is advised

Considering that I will need to be driving 1hr+ to get to a bank, perhaps the more nearby MoneyPak option would be cheaper. That depends on LocalBitcoins having a MoneyPak ad that isn&#039;t a price gouger.<br /><br />lol, the only public PayPal ad is for BitCoins at $190. :o
