				You will need:<br /><br />One stack of blank CD or DVDs<br />A USB flash drive. The faster the better (get a USB 3.0 one if your machine supports it)<br />A machine with an Internet connection and CD/DVD writer<br /><br />Steps:<br /><br />Download and install CDBurnerXP from cdburnerxp.se<br /><br />Download the latest Tails ISO image from tails.baum.org. For additional security follow the instructions to verify the image if your government have slipped you a bad copy. <br /><br />Use CDBurnerXP to write the image to a blank CD or DVD<br /><br />Plug in the USB disk, put the DVD in the drive and restart your machine.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the black screen where it says &quot;Press F1 to enter setup&quot; or something, you press that button to get into the BIOS settings.<br /><br />Look through the settings for &quot;boot order&quot; and set it to the following: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; First = CD/DVD drive. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Second = Removable drive or USB drive. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Third = Your hard drive.<br /><br />Choose the &quot;Save changes and exit&quot; option. Your computer should now boot into Tails!<br /><br />Once tails has loaded and you get to a desktop, click applications, Tails then Tails USB Installer and follow the on-screen instructions.<br /><br />Choose the shutdown option from the power button in the top right corner, eject the disk from the DVD drive but leave the USB disk plugged in.<br /><br />Turn your computer back on, it should boot into Tails again but this time from the USB disk.<br /><br />When you get to the desktop, click applications, tails, configure persistent storage.<br /><br />Create your storage with a really fucking long but memorable secret pass phrase that does not exist anywhere else, never has and never will. &quot;Boopity boop bing a bleepity bloop a-ding ding ding, Bob!&quot; is a good pass phrase, &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&quot; is not, while &quot;FavePass123&quot; is just negligent. Get this bit right.<br /><br />Once storage has been created (might take a while) reboot again. This time enable persistence at the login prompt and type your pass phrase.<br /><br />Go to applications, click Tails, Configure persistent storage. Tick everything and reboot again.<br /><br />You now have a secure Tor environment where you can do all your illegal shit. If your USB disk is small enough to swallow or put in your arse that&#039;s a bonus. Set up a Tormail account, save your vendor public keys, set up encryption keys so you can chat, bookmark your black market sites, set up accounts across the web etc. <br /><br />When you get a message balloon in the top right corner that says &quot;this version of tails has security issues&quot;, download the latest ISO again, burn it to disk, boot into it then use the installer to upgrade your USB disk.

				maybe it&#039;s just me but i somehow get the impression that OP is asking about security for everyday PC use.<br />in that case i don&#039;t think tails would fit his needs and would recommend he takes a look at linux in general (ubuntu or mint is good for beginners).<br />

				I&#039;m new to all this stuff generally, and just started using Tails yesterday, and if I can figure it out anybody can. Unfortunately I have an old laptop that can&#039;t boot from a thumb drive, so have to use a CD. Keep sensitive files on a thumb drive, which is so small I can&#039;t imagine anyone finding it during a search.<br /><br />It is kind of annoying having to configure everything everytime you start tails, especially downloading all the updates takes a long time. But I guess it&#039;s a small price to pay for peace of mind knowing I&#039;m keeping my computer reasonably clean of incriminating content.
