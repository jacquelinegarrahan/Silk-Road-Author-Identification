				So, I&#039;m a fairly new vendor, and have 21 transactions so far. My question for other vendors is, how many of your buyers don&#039;t use encryption of any kind, and just put their address in the box in plain text? I am shocked that over 75% of the people that have ordered from me thus far have not used encryption of any kind! I just don&#039;t understand it! For one thing, PGP is really not that hard to figure out, but to not even use Privnote?! Come on guys!!!

				I encrypt everything except totally harmless messages (I only skip encrypting those to not aggravate the recipient, honestly).&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s such a bad thing if someone doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; With a hidden Tor service, everything is end-to-end encrypted.&nbsp; The only reason to encrypt your address is if you&#039;re worried SR isn&#039;t really purging it and if the site is ever seized, a record of the order and address will exist somewhere.<br /><br />Also, depending on how you print out the address, encrypting it may just be incentive for vendors to leave the file sitting around on their hard drive.&nbsp; Most programs work on files, so it&#039;s probably going to be saved somewhere at least momentarily (though naturally you&#039;d know better than me -- I&#039;m just a buyer).<br /><br />Anyway, just my .02 BTC: it&#039;s not as insecure as you might think.

				Complete fucktards!<br /><br />I&#039;m only new here and consider myself,&nbsp; maybe, a bit smarter than your average Amazon-jock. Its taken me a few good weeks to get my head around this encryption business. And am still quite weary about making a purchase - yes Tor is secure now, but for how long?<br /><br />As a vendor, I&#039;d be concerned about MY privacy dealing with some dolt blabbing there order unencrypted. For the sake of the longevity of SR, distance yourself from anyone who doesn&#039;t (or won&#039;t ) follow the rules.

You might add something to your vendor page about how PGP is more about your buyers&#039; safety than about your safety- maybe link to a couple of threads about how to use it. But if they don&#039;t wanna learn it, that&#039;s on them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone apoplectic about vendors who won&#039;t use PGP at all, but that&#039;s because they won&#039;t give buyers a chance to protect themselves.

				Well, I&#039;ll fess up. Guilty as charged. - I&#039;m not a genius, but I&#039;m usually pretty good at shit like this. I must confess, I can&#039;t fucking wrap my tired old brain injured, drug addicted brain around it!<br /><br />I&#039;m Adult ADD-Pi, at least that&#039;s the latest name for what&#039;s been treated as everything from PTSD, to Clinical depression to Bi-Polar disorder, had a few bad car accidents in the 80&#039;s. One where I went through the windshield, so I have to preface my defense with those facts. <br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ve got some pretty decent amph right now, and could probably do a little old fashioned &quot;cramming&quot; on the subject. <br /><br />A few months back I downloaded the BIG package. GPU, , and started by getting my private key, my public key, etc. I read a few &quot;walk through&#039;s&quot; on these boards, and I just kept getting stuck on &quot;How do I unencrypt, and how to I send encrypt. - I&#039;m sure it sounds ridiculous to you, since you &quot;get it&quot;, but to someone with a slight &quot;learning disability&quot; in other words, slight dumbass brain. I just lock up mentally like an HP Laptop running Vista 4 years ago. (geez what a shitty program and laptop combo that was!)<br /><br />So if either of you got some &quot;PGP for dummies&quot; tutorials. I&#039;d be willing to give it the old &quot;college try&quot;, since I didn&#039;t go to college. - Wasn&#039;t that important in the 1980. Jobs were everywhere, ecomony was great, gas was under a dollar a gallon,&nbsp; and college wasn&#039;t a pre-requisite for most jobs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I was too busy hanging out in lower Manhatten going to punk rock concerts. <br /><br />I always figured if someone was monitoring your internet activity from a remote location, like LE sitting at a Time Warner office, they could see exactly what my key is, and that of the other person. So it seemed to me like a false sense of security.<br /><br />You really can see everything that way. I witnessed it when I was installing these new machines with a funny name called FIOS, about 7 years ago. We would monitor traffic and speed from time to time, and that meant bringing up an end user&#039;s screen. <br /><br />I&#039;ve managed since April to dodge the sellers that insist on PGP. - Though in light of the current &quot;outtages&quot; and SR being in the news more frequently around the globe. I&#039;ll give it another shot. <br /><br />So I&#039;ve fessed up. Anyone got any good pointers??????<br /><br />The orders can&#039;t be encrypted as far as I can see, am I wrong? - I wouldn&#039;t want to be called a &quot;fucktard&quot; &lt;- real mature. It seems it&#039;s only for the address and or the &quot;messages&quot; feature. <br /><br />Just because you have &quot;knowledge&quot; that someone else doesn&#039;t. Does not make you superior. I&#039;ve met plenty of people in my life who have PHD&#039;s, and I&#039;ll visit their house, and they keep bugging me to help them hook up their home theater speakers. - To me, that&#039;s crazy! Then again, everybody has their strengths and weaknesses. <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read about security on Tor, even before you get to silk road. Tor is already changing your IP address every so often (or you can manually click the onion every 5 minutes if you&#039;re that paranoid.<br /><br />Also my theory about LE&nbsp; sitting in your local ISP&#039;s office, scanning for anyone who uses Tor.&nbsp; In that capacity, they could see every move you make, including, your PGP code, the other guys PGP code. It just seems like a false sense of security. Though it may slow them up. ie; they&#039;ll go after the unencrypted ones first, as they&#039;re easier. <br /><br />Also, when I first started out buying last spring, the vendors asking for PGP, were willing to let me go without it, saying it&#039;s for your protection, not mine. Lot&#039;s of info swirling around about it. <br /><br />Sometimes it make me leery of not using it. It could be because I&#039;m weary from lack of sleep. Still I understand some people are wary of not using it. (see what I did there?)<br /><br />For every encryption, there&#039;s a hacker out there who sees it as a challenge, and some of them, go to work for LE. <br /><br />Still open to a good source of tutorials. - Not the one on here. A link to a video would be nice!

Can&#039;t place order if the address field doesn&#039;t contain a valid PGP encrypted string. Easy solution. <br /><br />It&#039;s not as much of a danger as a lot of ppl seem to think though. It should be done in case SR gets compromised. And although I think SR security can always be improved, it&#039;s probably far superior to that of most vendors. Once the address is on your machine, it doesn&#039;t matter if it came cleartext or encrypted. The biggest vulnerability is a vendor&#039;s machine regarding this kind of data. From what I have seen here (no offense to the really security aware vendors - kudos to you) with some vendors, SR would be Fort Knox in comparison.

				I immediately cancel the order if a buyer sends his information unencrypted. Then I PM him and politely let him know of the dangers associated with such action, and ask if he wants to reorder, to please send by email to one of my nymserver addresses if they really don&#039;t know a thing about PGP; these addresses automatically encrypt all the infiormation that gets to me.<br /><br />I also caution the buyers against using Privnote.<br /><br />goblin

				Encryption is for your protection as well as the buyers.&nbsp; Don&#039;t make it easy for the LE to find you, dipshits.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t take the time to figure out GPG, how the hell did you even make it here?

				@jagfug: no worries mate, hopefully this will help you out.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, orders themselves can&#039;t be encrypted.&nbsp; Just your address on that checkout page.&nbsp; But really, everything you do on Silk Road is encrypted by the Tor network anyway, so when I say the order can&#039;t be encrypted all I mean is that you can&#039;t encrypt it *more*.&nbsp; It already is encrypted.<br /><br />Just to be clear, nobody listening in to your connection can tell what you&#039;re doing, but anybody who has control of the Silk Road server could see everything.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t true all the time, just with Tor hidden services. If you go to google.com or something, it&#039;s not encrypted.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen people recommend the program &quot;gpg4usb&quot;.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s it anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never looked at it, but it&#039;s supposed to be easy.&nbsp; You might give that a try.<br /><br />Personally, I keep my address in a text file that I then encrypt for each order by typing &quot;gpg -a -e -r {vendor} address.txt&quot;.&nbsp; That makes it plain-text readable instead of all funky symbols that don&#039;t copy &amp; paste so well, and outputs a file called &quot;address.txt.asc&quot;.&nbsp; The contents of that file is what I put as my address.<br /><br />The whole idea is that there are two keys that are kind of paired to each other, the public and private key pair.&nbsp; The public key you give out to the public, and the private one you never let anyone else see.&nbsp; People use the public key to encrypt stuff, and once something&#039;s been encrypted with a public key, only the matching private key can decrypt it.<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot more to it, but for making orders, it&#039;s really that simple.&nbsp; Once you use the public key of a key pair, only the private key can decrypt it. Hope that helps some.

				I can&#039;t believe how easy PGP actually was...<br /><br />Here&#039;s a guide as I would personally write it (for Windows):<br /><br />Installation and setup:<br />Download PortablePGP here: http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/usb.html<br />Start the application and it will ask you whether you have a keypair. You don&#039;t if you&#039;re reading this, so say you don&#039;t<br />Enter your (fake or real, probably fake) name, e-mail and a comment if you&#039;re feeling adventurous.<br />Enter a strong password, the longer the better, but don&#039;t forget it!<br />Now you have your own &quot;keypair&quot;, which is a private and a public key. The public key is for everyone else to know, but the private one must be kept secret AT ALL COSTS.<br /><br />To send:<br />Get the recipient&#039;s public PGP key and store it in a standard text file anywhere on your computer.<br />In PortablePGP, click Keyring.<br />Right next to &quot;Public Keys&quot;, click &quot;arrow down&quot; to import the recipient&#039;s key.<br />Select the text file where the recipient&#039;s public key is stored.<br />Now you&#039;ve successfully imported a public key so that you won&#039;t have to repeat the above procedure everytime you send them a message.<br />Click Encrypt.<br />Enter your message, whatever it is, just like you normally would.<br />For &quot;Target&quot;, pick the recipient you imported.<br />For &quot;Sign&quot;, choose your own key.<br />Click Encrypt. (The button with the play icon this time.)<br />Enter your passphrase.<br />A new window will pop up which is your encrypted message which is readable only by the recipient and you! You are free to do with this as you wish.<br /><br />To read:<br />Click Decrypt.<br />Paste the encrypted message you have received from the sender.<br />Click Decrypt. (The button with the play icon again.)<br />Enter your passphrase.<br />Done!

				A lot of people either have no idea beyond clicking stuff on a screen or simply do not care to use PGP thinking fuck you, come after me for my tiny bit of weed.<br /><br />This is why privacybox.de exists (there&#039;s also an .onion page), because you can send your link to somebody who knows nothing about PGP and it will encrypt everything they write to you with your own public key. It&#039;s open source software, so not only could SR/DPR incorporate it into the site (he should) but you can buy your own VPS server and run the source yourself. Get an account there and then send it to buyers who can&#039;t figure out PGP. <br /><br />

You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you hve added to your PGP kryring<br /><br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br />Naturally, you can change any of these shortcuts to ones of your own choosing, if you wish. <br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG. <br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient&#039;s PGP public key. <br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the file to a file; you can file the file, import.asc, for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder. <br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the file named import.asc, and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring. <br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR). When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go. <br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously. <br /><br />Guru (original author)<br />

				Just for posterity&#039;s sake, ThePhoenix&#039;s problem was that he had TextEdit set to rich text mode. You have to put it into plain text mode using the Format menu. You can also set it to use plain text mode by default, in Preferences. Another tip: You can just highlight text (such as public keys) and drag it onto the TextEdit dock icon directly.

				Buyers not encrypting their addresses are crazy! It is a risk which can be eliminated with the simple use of PGP. There are numerous threads on the Forum containing guides on how to use PGP, and plenty of experienced members only too willing to help you should you need it. In most cases, buyers/sellers are just too lazy to take the time to learn and are prepared to &quot;risk it&quot;, putting it in the &quot;too hard&quot; basket. IMO, too many people seem to think using SR safely and securely is just a matter of using Tor! Please, set some time aside to browse through the Forum and read up on the methods used to protect yourself and remain anonymous. Your safety is PARAMOUNT, above all else!

				Like I said, I always encrypt my address and messages, and I agree that it&#039;s best to encrypt... but I can&#039;t help but feel as though people don&#039;t actually understand how the Tor network works, or what end-to-end encryption actually does...&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Well, it doesn&#039;t really matter.&nbsp; It&#039;s good advice, regardless, right&nbsp; :)

Right back at you.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />pbody88, people may use a fake name and drop box address, however, if your address is not sent encrypted and is intercepted by LE, written in plain text, they would only have to set up surveillance on the drop box address to catch you, regardless of your fake name. This is hypothetically speaking of course.

				same here. ive been a vendor here for over 8 months and have done several hundred transactions. Most of them, easily 80%, use NO encryption! The remainer: 15% use privnote and just 5% of my customers to date use full GPG encryption. i&#039;m absolutely bewildered.&nbsp; :o

				Bugs the shit out of me that buyers don&#039;t use PGP.<br />I don&#039;t give a fuck if you&#039;re comfortable with the risk, it endangers ME.<br /><br />The point of PGP encrypting the order is that we don&#039;t have to trust whether SR has been compromised. Which is the way I like. Trusting no one.<br />Because if SR does get compromised then all these cleartext orders are seen, the packages can get intercepted, dusted for fingerprints and DNA swabbed.<br /><br />Solution?

				The messages are stored on a server, most likely a database, until they&#039;re deleted/viewed.&nbsp; That means that there are a number of enemies.&nbsp; <br /><br />1) Law Enforcement / Government - seizing the server - all unencrypted information upon seizure is easily read; every order &quot;in processing&quot; becomes open information to the Govt. <br />2) Hacker finds a vulnerability and finds access to messages - The Site goes through random modifications and outages, and may wind up with a programming vulnerability.&nbsp; Hacker finds this, and has access to the server, and your information.<br />3) Yourself - You use a shitty password, or you signed up for a phishing site using the same login information - now anyone who knows that password can read all of your messages<br />4) Silk Road itself - while I&#039;ve never had a personal problem with the service or the staff (they&#039;ve been 100% helpful to me) - they still can have access to your personal information, and there is no need for the site/service to see your information.<br /><br />And here are things we really dont know, as just random users of the service: (and we really shouldnt know)<br />1) Who the admins are, and how many of them have access to our information? and will they EVER be abusive with out information?<br />2) How close any government/law enforcement is to actually being able to seize servers<br />3) How secure the coding is of all the different processes included in SR.<br />4) Where the servers are located, physically, and what kind of laws and regulations might be placed upon the server if seized.&nbsp; <br />etc etc etc - the list of things to worry about goes on and on and on<br /><br />eliminate as much stress as you can, and just encrypt your communications about any incriminating/personal behavior!<br /><br />PLEASE!
