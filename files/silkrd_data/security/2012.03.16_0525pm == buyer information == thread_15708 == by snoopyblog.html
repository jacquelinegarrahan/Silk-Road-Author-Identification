				i&#039;m wondering what information the seller can see about you when you make a purchase with them, i know they can see your purchasing stats that&#039;s fine by me but can they see your transaction history and&nbsp; your old feedback? if police were to set up a fake account and you made a purchase with them they would have access to that info and that would be very very bad.

				I dont know for sure because I am not a seller but I doubt it very much that a seller could get everything you have bought. SR just removed a lot of stuff buyers can see about other buys like the time you bought things. so they take that kind of thing seriously. and even if they can and a cop saw your past things it would mean shit because they have not proof unless they can tie that account to you and even if you gave them your address on sr they would still have to prove that that account is yours because anyone can enter in a fake address on sr it does not mean that the person that gave them the address to ship is really their address.
