				Hi ,<br /><br />sorry, I know that this topic has been treated often here, but most of the sites that were mentioned earlier seem to have changed their policies.<br /><br />I have done a lot of research in the last couple of days, so please don&#039;t think that I am simply too lazy to investigate, but I didn&#039;t find a way to buy bitcoins with creditcard or paysafecard that is feasible for me (I am located in Europe).<br /><br />I understand the risk a seller has to take when accepting creditcards, but I don&#039;t understand the problem with paysafecards, they should be redeemable online and there is no way for a charge-back imo?<br />I also don&#039;t understand why there is no service that accepts creditcards but delays the payout until no charge-back is possible anymore, I would be willing to wait some time until the BTCs arrive.<br /><br />Just to show you that I have done some research myself:<br /><br />bitmarket.eu: no paypal<br />secondlife.com: client only for windows, I use linux<br />alertpay.com: validation necessary<br />webmoney.ru: tried to exchange paysafecard, no answer yet<br />dwolla.com: phone verification<br />www.velaexchange.com/:&nbsp; ordered via creditcard 4 days ago, no answer<br />www.moneybookers.com: very low limits (56$/90 days)<br />pecunix.com: no paypal<br />www.exchangezone.com: verification<br />moneycentralmarket.com: doesn&#039;t seem to be working currently, I always get a server error at some point<br />aurumage.com: verification<br />www.globalpaysol.com: blocked by paypal<br />centregold.com: doesn&#039;t work using TOR<br />www.electrumx.com: they ofer creditcard to LR, but I didn&#039;t receive any money<br />btc-e.com: no paypal<br />okpay.com: no paypal<br />virwox.com: only for online game accounts, ok, if I have to do this, I will, but that seems quite complicated to me<br /><br /><br />Thank you for reading this far :)<br /><br /><br />Br,<br /><br />Stephe<br /><br /><br />

				VirWoX seems to be one of the last places to pay with PayPal, but (as I mentioned in another topic) you&#039;ll pay for the privilege. With VirWoX, make an account (put random info for your second-life avatar), deposit money, buy Linden Dollars (Second Life currency) and convert those to BitCoins.<br /><br />While most markets were at $2.3 usd / bitcoin, VirWoX ended up being about $4 usd / bitcoin for me.

				virwox &amp; secondlife: <br />- is anyone sure that the secondlife account doesn&#039;t have be to an account avatar thats ever been used? ...since i just created an arbitrary one and since connecting<br />&nbsp; it seemed to know that the secondlife account hadn&#039;t been used/activated obviously virwox &amp; secondlife are sharing data..?!<br /><br />thanks<br />
