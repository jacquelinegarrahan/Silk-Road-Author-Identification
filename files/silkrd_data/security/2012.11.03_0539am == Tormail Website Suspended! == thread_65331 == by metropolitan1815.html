				That worked for me. Normally I just type tormail.org and it refers me but it say&#039;s it&#039;s suspended, weird. http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/ works fine though! Thanks so much.

				Are there alternative email options to Tormail. It&#039;s hit and miss with me. Can&#039;t seem to sign in quite often.

				The tormail.org/.net clearnet site is still down, the hidden server is not though.&nbsp; In response to damaged&#039;s comment, I think tormail was talking about the hidden servers.&nbsp; The clearnet site is nice to have but realistically anyone who knows deepweb enough shouldn&#039;t have an issue getting the hidden link to the site.

				Well, since you can&#039;t just query tormail.org and let the program set itself up anymore and the hidden service isn&#039;t that obvious: thought this might be useful for people to have around somewhere.<br /><br />Outgoing mail is SMTP at jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion on port 25. No security for connection, password transmitted insecurely. (hidden services have end-to-end encryption already anyway).<br /><br />Incoming mail is IMAP at jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion on port 143. Same security/authentication.&nbsp; Thunderbird, Seamonkey I think... Hell, even Microsoft Outlook should work fine with it if you go through Tor.<br /><br /><br />As for onion sites having funky names, I think it&#039;s something to do with the initial salt that&#039;s used to seed the random algorithms... but I really don&#039;t know enough about cryptography to say with any certainty. Just a vague memory of something or other like that.
