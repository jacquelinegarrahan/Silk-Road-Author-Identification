				The majority of devices connected to the Tor privacy service may be using encryption keys that can be broken by the National Security Agency, a security researcher has speculated.<br /><br />Rob Graham, CEO of penetration testing firm Errata Security, arrived at that conclusion by running his own &quot;hostile&quot; exit node on Tor and surveying the encryption algorithms established by incoming connections. About 76 percent of the 22,920 connections he polled used some form of 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman key. The analysis came a day after revelations the NSA can circumvent much of the encryption used on the Internet. While no one knows for sure exactly what the NSA is capable of cracking, educated speculation has long made a case that the keys Graham observed are within reach of the US spy agency.<br /><br />&quot;Everyone seems to agree that if anything, the NSA can break 1024 RSA/DH keys,&quot; Graham wrote in a blog post published Friday. &quot;Assuming no &#039;breakthroughs,&#039; the NSA can spend $1 billion on custom chips that can break such a key in a few hours. We know the NSA builds custom chips, they&#039;ve got fairly public deals with IBM foundries to build chips.&quot;<br /><br />He went on to cite official Tor statistics to observe that only 10 percent of Tor servers are using version 2.4 of the software. That&#039;s the only Tor release that implements elliptical curve Diffie-Hellman crypto, which cryptographers believe is much harder to break. The remaining versions use keys that are presumed to be weaker.<br /><br />Graham called on Tor Project leaders to do a better job of getting end users to upgrade to version 2.4, but he also couched his findings with a word of caution.<br /><br />&quot;Of course, this is just guessing about the NSA&#039;s capabilities,&quot; he wrote. &quot;As it turns out, the newer elliptical keys may turn out to be relatively easier to crack than people thought, meaning that older software may in fact be more secure. But since 1024 bit RSA/DH has been the most popular SSL encryption for the past decade, I&#039;d assume that it&#039;s that, rather than curves, [it&#039;s 1024 RSA/DH] that the NSA is best at cracking.&quot;<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/majority-of-tor-crypto-keys-could-be-broken-by-nsa-researcher-says/

				Fortunately, a solution of sorts does exist. A family of encryption algorithms called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) exists. ECC is similar to the other asymmetric algorithms, in that it&#039;s based on a problem that&#039;s assumed to be hard (in this case, the elliptic curve discrete logarithm). ECC, however, has the additional property that its hard problem is sufficiently different from integer factorization and the regular discrete logarithm that breakthroughs in either of those shouldn&#039;t imply breakthroughs in cracking ECC.<br /><br />However, support for ECC is still very problematic. Much of the technology is patented by BlackBerry, and those patents are enforced. There are certain narrow licenses available for implementations of ECC that meet various US government criteria, but the broader patent issues have led some vendors to refuse to support the technology.<br /><br />Further, support of protocols that can use ECC, such as TLS 1.2 (the latest iteration of SSL technology) is still not widely available. Certificate authorities have also been slow to offer ECC certificates.<br /><br />As such, the researchers are calling for the computer industry as a whole to do two things. First, embrace ECC today. Second, ensure that systems that use cryptography are agile. They must not be lumbered with limited sets of algorithms and obsolete protocols. They must instead make updating algorithms and protocols quick and easy, to ensure that software systems can keep pace with the mathematical research and adapt quickly to new developments and techniques. The cryptopocalypse might never happenâ€”but we should be prepared in case it does.<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/crytpo-experts-issue-a-call-to-arms-to-avert-the-cryptopocalypse/

				I just want to point out that technically ECDH and DH are not asymmetric algorithms, but rather are secret derivation algorithms. ECDH and DH are not even encryption algorithms. You cannot encrypt or decrypt anything with them. <br /><br />Symmetric Encryption (AES) = Encrypt and Decrypt with single key<br />Asymmetric Encryption (RSA) = Encrypt with public key, Decrypt with private key<br />Secret Derivation (ECDH) = Pubkey-A and Privkey-B = Secret1, Pubkey-B And Privkey-A = Secret1<br /><br />I just point this out because it is extremely common misconception that asymmetric encryption = anything with public and private key. Not all public-private algorithms are asymmetric cryptography, and some of the most popular ones are not even encryption algorithms at all. <br /><br />A few ECC algorithms are included in OpenSSL, a few other libraries as well. I don&#039;t know if they are in violation of BlackBerrys patents or not, but I doubt it as ECDH and ECDSA are widely used. There is really no reason for any new software to use RSA or DH imo, ECDH and ECDSA are both easily utilized and have some significantly superior properties to RSA, including key size, security, and speed.

If an adversary with capabilities remotely approaching NSA&#039;s is *specificially targeting you as an individual*, under a microscope, and they&#039;re motivated, you are fucked.&nbsp; That&#039;s not a function of 1024-bit vs 4096-bit.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a function of capabilities and resources.&nbsp; And it will always be true.&nbsp; There&#039;s not a gap in technology that&#039;s going to protect against that.&nbsp; They can spend billions and employ armies of people smarter than you.<br />2. The risk that everyone should be concerned about is NSA/etc&#039;s ability to target classes/types of users across the board.&nbsp; Throwing out a net.&nbsp; &nbsp;And while I believe that through traffic analysis and other capabilities, they should be able to target Tor users on a fairly broad scale, I think it would require a level of effort that may or may not be worth it from their perspective.<br /><br />Personally, I think NSA probably records all Tor traffic they can see, and given the right motivation, can crunch that saved traffic to deanonymize a high percentage of users and draw significant conclusions about what they&#039;re probably doing.&nbsp; Once that boils down to a handful of individuals they care about, they can own them.<br /><br />There&#039;s just not some silver encryption bullet that will ever protect you against smart people that can spend $11 billion dollars a year and devote 35,000 people to hosing *you*.&nbsp; &nbsp; But we can make it increasingly harder and more expensive for them to do it.&nbsp; And when we raise the cost for them to do it, we decrease the likelihood that &quot;our&quot; traffic (whatever that means) is where they want to spend their money.&nbsp; <br /><br />NSA has real problems to solve, and Tor users browsing SR isn&#039;t one of their problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tor users browsing CP on FH sites might get tasked as one of their problems, but that&#039;s a side project and a distraction to their core focus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Their true goal is maintaining long-term access to every interesting bit of information they can so they can appear omniscient. <br /><br /><br /><br />

If the US government is that pissed at you, they&#039;re capable of almost anything.&nbsp; Viktor Bout figured that out.&nbsp; Every SR user/consumer?&nbsp; Not impossible, just unlikely.<br />

				Parallel reconstruct is way easier on drug users than CP viewers. Random interception, dog hit on the package, etc. For CP viewer what are they gonna say? I guess that they hacked the computer. But that would entail that the computer seized was actually hackable. And I don&#039;t think the NSA is gonna burn zero days busting people for CP. And in fact the exploit that was used against people going to FH servers was a month old and had already been patched.

				kmfkewm is right again as usual :)&nbsp; Parallel reconstruction is probably *easiest* for drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on a broad scale, it would be relatively difficult to pull off, except for large vendors.&nbsp; Too many LE agents involved to keep the parallel reconstruction lie alive successfully.&nbsp; At least, there&#039;s that risk from their perspective.<br /><br />And the whole &quot;They were after Tormail, not CP&quot; is a definitely valid point if the attack actually involved NSA.&nbsp; It would take exactly one high value target using it to make the whole thing worth it. <br /><br />But we&#039;re all just guessing.

				Apparently the NSA has been promoting elliptical curve cryptography since 2009. That could mean that they have a way to break it already. But they don&#039;t seem to push the certificate authorities to introduce ECC keys.<br /><br />Bruce Schneier:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Certainly the fact that the NSA is pushing elliptic-curve cryptography is some indication that it can break them more easily.<br /><br />If we think that&#039;s the case, the fix is easy: increase the key lengths.<br /><br />Assuming the hypothetical NSA breakthroughs don&#039;t totally break public-cryptography -- and that&#039;s a very reasonable assumption -- it&#039;s pretty easy to stay a few steps ahead of the NSA by using ever-longer keys. We&#039;re already trying to phase out 1024-bit RSA keys in favor of 2048-bit keys. Perhaps we need to jump even further ahead and consider 3072-bit keys. And maybe we should be even more paranoid about elliptic curves and use key lengths above 500 bits.<br /><br />One last blue-sky possibility: a quantum computer. Quantum computers are still toys in the academic world, but have the theoretical ability to quickly break common public-key algorithms -- regardless of key length -- and to effectively halve the key length of any symmetric algorithm. I think it extraordinarily unlikely that the NSA has built a quantum computer capable of performing the magnitude of calculation necessary to do this, but it&#039;s possible. The defense is easy, if annoying: stick with symmetric cryptography based on shared secrets, and use 256-bit keys.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsas_crypto_1.html<br /><br />However the reason why the NSA was pushing ECC may not be because they can attack ECC generally, but because they put a backdoor into one ECC pseudo random generator. I assume there can be lots of different methods of generating random numbers for ECC. Unfortunately I don&#039;t understand enough about it to see if the method Tor uses is flawed.<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/11/securitymatters_1115

For starters I don&#039;t think the FH bust was all about CP at all. Just like the &#039;drug war&#039; was used as an excuse for decades for authoritarian police action in certain circles (black/poor, but not rich white guys work on Wall St), I think CP is starting to be used as an excuse to stamp all over the internet in digital jack-boots. Sure, the people at the FBI probably believe in what they&#039;re doing, but someone signs the funding orders - that&#039;s ultimately how priorities are arranged. And if the NSA have plants in commercial software companies inserting backdoors into encryption implementation, you can bet they&#039;ll have some HumInt in the FBI on digital matters like CP.<br /><br />So, on to drugs; the government never intended to stop drug-trade, they simply wanted it illegal. That way they have an excuse to do things they&#039;d otherwise have problems with. In fact, there is some good evidence that the US government (or branches of it at least) have encouraged the drug trade. Certainly, it was not always true that Afghanistan grew so much opium - it used to grow as much marijuana, but this was stamped out and replaced with opium so that black ghettos could be flooded with heroin, in an attempt to stem civil rights movements and groups like the Black Panthers. So, I seriously doubt there is much impetus to go around busting buyers/sellers on SR (though I imagine if they could, they would collect all the info in case they feel like busting you). I&#039;ll bet they would love to get their hands on DPR and the SR servers though, but I also bet they&#039;d leave them up and running and none of us here would know the difference - just another reason to encrypt you&#039;re address manually with PGP when buying....<br /><br />And one last thing, look at the latest leaks. Look at what they&#039;re actually targeting; HTTPS and SSL - these are not so they can catch CPers or drug users, these are commercial standards used by the general public. In fact, the documents (as far as I have understood them) mention inserting weaknesses and backdoors into commercial products alot, but mentions open-source very little. Now, either they&#039;re not really interested in the kind of open-source encryption that a minority of internet users use (but the majority of illicit users use), or they&#039;ve hidden that intent/capability much better than the rest of the project. I&#039;m inclined to the former, since weakening commercial products is MUCH more controversial as it undermines modern banking and commerce, but is far more useful as far as wide-ranging spying is concerned. Open-source is only used by weirdos, lefty-liberals, CPers, deviants, and those with something to hide, so would be fairly uncontroversial as a target...

The trickier part is making the public key from the private key. I can do that too, but would need to write a little C program and use OpenSSL.

I also think about the other shit like neighbors or police taking down a plate number or being there if a raid happens, been close a couple times in my 20+ years of RL dealings. But, none of my potential problem would have been a federal charge/felony.&nbsp; I&#039;m very grateful though to know about and use the Silk Road, i don&#039;t ever want to go back to RL dealings. Just being a bit paranoid (mostly when I&#039;m stoned) is all.

				I know but you said he is probably the most knowledgeable crypto guy to be involved with Tor, but DJB and Ian Goldberg are involved with Tor and they are the people the Tor developers get some of their encryption algorithms from, and also the ones they turn to for crypto advice the most I would say.

				How are they involved? I guess it depends on how you define &quot;involved&quot;, but rransom wrote code for Tor and managed bug tickets and stuff like that. DJB and Goldberg would be more like consultants.<br />
