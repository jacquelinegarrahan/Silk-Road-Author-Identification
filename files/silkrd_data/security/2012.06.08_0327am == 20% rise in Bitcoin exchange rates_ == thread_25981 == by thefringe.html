				Whats going on with the BTC market... anyone BTC traders as well here? Large rises in the last week or two...<br /><br />Vendors might have to start cutting their price, or those who are dealing with bitcoins now just made a 15-20% premium from sales a few weeks ago.

				Just speculating from the season at the moment but since the festival season has been approaching it seems to have shot up probably due to so many people buying like crazy to resell at festivals and its reached its pick during the middle of the season, seems to have dropped a little bit but who knows if it will go back up but this is the first time ive seen it go this high since using SR in the last 7 months,

				Doesn&#039;t this just mean more people are buying bitcoins? supply vs demand... if the demand is greater then the supply the overall price of bitcoins increases.. and inverse the other way.. so it looks like people are just buying a shit ton of bitcoins faster than people are cashing out. How often do people cash out their bitcoins? In large amounts?

				So.. I have been doing some investigation into this. It seems that there is some abnormal vdemand by some euro based bitcoin traders. Still I am not convinced entirely thats all it is due to, this article seems to think that people are treating bitcoins like gold to protect against debasement of the fiat currencies (everyone is expecting the worlds central banks to print money).. still my mind is thinking someone is holding back supply...for one reason or another.<br /><br />Its gone up another 10% in the last day. GBP BTC is up around 3.9!<br /><br />Now here&#039;s the rub. I have been looking at purchasing from AfterHours. 2gs of coke for 34.52 BTC aday or two ago now its 33.22BTC... but the USD bitcoin rate has gone up 10% since 4pm yesterday...and there has been no drop in the price for a non US vendor...strange?<br /><br />The question is when do the vendor&#039;s price update? We should be seeing 2gs from AfterHours at 30 BTC soon.. if not then some vendors are not pegging their goods to the USD

				yep the vendors should be turning some good coin at the moment of they are cashing out now trades done awhile ago. <br /><br />Move the BTCs fast though.. these types of climbs are also at the risk of having 15-20% drops overnight.<br /><br />If this article is correct<br /><br />http://business.financialpost.com/2012/06/08/euro-fears-boost-virtual-currency-bitcoin<br /><br />and the greeks vote to stay in the EU then there could be some BTC traders cashing their chips in fairly quickly. this could also affect vendors negatively who trade now and hug and hold their bitcoins for the next few weeks watching it drop.<br /><br />Question as a vendor when do your prices get updated?<br />

				Well this type of fluctuation is fairly common in BTC.&nbsp; I remember when it went from 15 USD to 5.&nbsp; That killed a lot of vendors back when that happened.
