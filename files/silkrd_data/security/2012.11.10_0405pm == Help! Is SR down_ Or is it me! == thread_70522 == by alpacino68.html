				SR is down if you haven&#039;t noticed already. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. Whether it&#039;s been hacked, compromised or if it is just a maintenance problem.

				I can&#039;t log in, too. I don&#039;t know if this is the end of&nbsp; silk road but I think it&#039;s not. I visit the Silk Road for 6 months now and things like that happened before and changed after a few days back to normal. I think it is not a thing to worry about. But I also want to see opinions of the other Silk Road users.&nbsp;

				I was on yesterday and everything was fine. Can&#039;t get on today, but this kind of shit happens to me all the time with SR during peak hours. It&#039;s a Saturday, so I was just assuming that the server was overloaded. I&#039;m gonna check back late tonight.

				&quot;I am so sorry to leave you guys hanging for so long wondering what is going on with the site today. Let me just make everything clear and reassure you all that Silk Road has NOT been compromised, DPR has NOT been busted, and EVERYTHING IS OKAY!<br /><br />Yes, we are having some technical difficulties. We have been making some serious overhauls and changes to the system, server, and website. While I cannot tell you exactly what is wrong today, I can assure you that we will fix it and have it back up soon. By soon, I mean I would be shocked if we didn&#039;t have it back up by Monday.&quot;<br />

Shame it took a while to get the official status , Must admit I like the new look to the forum&nbsp; :D
