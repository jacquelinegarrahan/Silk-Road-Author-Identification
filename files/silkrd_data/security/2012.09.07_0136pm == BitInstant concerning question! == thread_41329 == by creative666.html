				Some 12 hours went by since my order has been processed via BitInstant cash deposit at wallmart using the instawallet address. The instawallet url and my address is a complete match when I compare it to the confirmation email so I&#039;m 100% sure I didn&#039;t fuck up there. I always save the url and address to my tormail&#039;s draft section. I even contacted BitInstant support and was told that my Order ID has been processed and the agent posted my transaction info and it clearly shows the correct address.<br /><br />Is this a common thing with bitinstant? Last time my funds appeared in my wallet within an hour. Should I be worried? <br /><br />I used a different name/address/phone # on the deposit slip. I don&#039;t know what gives. Anyone been in this situation before? <br /><br />Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.

				yesterday bitinstant was having problems sending out bitcoins and I had to wait a lot longer then usual to receive mine but I finally did. Apparently they fixed the bug so maybe they are still having problems. I would email bitinstant support, usually they are pretty fast at responding

This is what I was just told by bitinstant support agent. And yes, they are very fast at responding. 2 thumbs up for that. <br /><br />&quot;Hi,<br /><br />I had the system check for missing transactions and yours turned up. It<br />was processed 4 blocks ago. See: posted my address&quot;<br /><br />All good now. Got my coins.
