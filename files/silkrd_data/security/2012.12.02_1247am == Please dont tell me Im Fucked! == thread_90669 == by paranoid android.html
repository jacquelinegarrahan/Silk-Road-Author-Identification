				Im pretty new to the road.&nbsp; First couple orders went smooth.&nbsp; Then I got careless...I ordered multiple orders at once.&nbsp; But what I am most worried about is that I just placed an order with a vendor who has been around less than a month.&nbsp; Plus he has no feedback, Im talking 0% from 0 trans.&nbsp; <br /><br />Could he be LE?&nbsp; What do you guys think is the worst case scenario?&nbsp; And how can I prepare for it? Or am I just smoking too much weed?

				This isn&#039;t amazon don&#039;t order a ton of stuff internationally all at once to your home address, somebody will notice. Shit can go wrong, and then you have a bunch more envelopes on the way for cops to intercept and add on charges though highly unlikely this will happen, just remember for future.<br /><br />New vendor is 100% not a cop, unless you are ordering precursor materials and paying like $10,000+ for it. <br />You should be worried that this new vendor could have potential shitty stealth, unless they clearly outlined what security they use in their listing. You can always cancel the transaction <br /><br />

				&nbsp;People order from new vendors all the time. How else are they going to start out. Who was the vendor if you are so worried. Are they communicating with you? This all might just be unnecessary paranoia man. I wouldn&#039;t worry, I have multiple packs come to me all the time. But like cosmec said try to stay domestic if you don&#039;t want the risk. I also love your name. My favorite book series.

				Is the vendor you&#039;re concerned about acyive at all in the forum? Does he have a thread started?<br />There&#039;s a vendor that&#039;s new i&#039;ll be placing an order with soon, they have to start getting customers sometime. This vendor is active a bit though.

				Well, the only way to guarantee vendor isn&#039;t a cop is his positive feedback given by your known friend who ordered stuff from him many times for a year or more.<br />Otherwise it still has its chances to be fraud or cop.<br />It&#039;s the risk we accept here..

				Even vendors have to start somewhere. Is he communicating with you? Is he posting on the forum? What&#039;s his user name on the forum? We could all ask around and support each other on here in order to weed out the bad apples. I would hope cops are not wasting their time with small fish. How did you get your BTCs?

				Thanks for your guys&#039; feedback.&nbsp; I got my first BTC through bitinstant moneygram with a fake name and cash of course.&nbsp; Then I &quot;washed&quot; them through a few wallets.&nbsp; Did that once more for more BTC using different info/wallets.&nbsp; Last BTC transfer was done here on a SR listing for a moneypak.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know Im probably just being paranoid.&nbsp; Ive kept everything domestic, no intl orders.&nbsp; I ordered the same week as I did my xmas shopping online hoping they would think those are gifts I bought online too (not sure if that was a good or bad idea).&nbsp; The new vendor has been cooperative and even lowered the amount of the listing so I could sample the product.&nbsp; Doesnt seem very active tho.&nbsp; Dont want to call him out just yet.&nbsp; The package should be here tomorrow he says so I will let you guys know what happens.<br /><br />But....what if hes not legit?&nbsp; Should I wipe my hard drive since I access tor through my computer and not through the linux usb tails method?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or is tor alone enough to keep me safe?&nbsp; There no real evidence tying me to the purchase right?&nbsp; I mean, anyone could have sent me those drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;This chronic from the road has got met thinking all sorts of crazy shit.&nbsp;

				So, regarding general Tor dangers:&nbsp; (read the last post in particular... you should know about it)&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=89733.msg639839#msg639839<br /><br />Tor encryption:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=83886.msg632461#msg632461<br /><br /><br />That&#039;ll tell you everything you need to know, probably.&nbsp; For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve generally begun to think it&#039;s virtually impossible for a package to get intercepted unless you&#039;re shipping it express.&nbsp; Stick to priority or possibly first-class when necessary and you should be fine.&nbsp; Some people have done 50+ or even 100+ without a single loss.

				LE cares a lot to get someone busted on SR, I am sure! They need it for the publicity and to make an example of one of us. Again, as I understand it, xfring wallet to wallet does nothing, unless you pay for a mixing service. Am I wrong?

				Don&#039;t give them a reason to make you a target.&nbsp; Just be unimportant and don&#039;t draw attention to yourself.&nbsp; You&#039;re more likely to get busted for things you do IRL than on SR.&nbsp; For that matter, you&#039;re also more likely to die in a plane crash than get busted for personal amounts on SR.&nbsp; But those odds increase dramatically the more stupid shit you do, basically.
