May I recommend you obtain a version of Liberte Linux, verify the download checksum, and install on a USB stick for future use. After the exploit used by the FBI to unmask IP address&#039; I think this is the only safe way to go... unless anyone else has any suggestions?<br /><br />BTW - what borwser bundle is it and where did you download it? If you trust the bundle it might be something else - try deleting the &#039;.to&#039; part of the URL and manually typing in the SR URL... but if I were you, to be safe, I&#039;d switch to a more secure option...

				Your browser bundle is probably fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;But you still have a problem:<br /><br />This is really important to understand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if anyone can&#039;t follow it, they need to stop using hidden services until they understand it..&nbsp; Seriously, it&#039;s not for you.<br /><br />onion.to is a Tor-to-web gateway.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to a URL that ends in onion.to, you&#039;re not connecting directly to the hidden service.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;re connecting to a website (onion.to), that THEN connects&nbsp; to a hidden site for you and sends you back the results.&nbsp; &nbsp;And onion.to can see all of your traffic.&nbsp; So the connection looks like You-&gt;Tor-&gt;Exit Node-&gt; (onion.to, a site ran by people you&#039;d be an idiot to trust)-&gt;Hidden Service.<br /><br />Hidden services end in .onion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not .onion.to.<br /><br />If you&#039;re EVER connecting to a hidden service via onion.to, you&#039;ve made a serious mistake.&nbsp; &nbsp;The admins of onion.to have the ability to see what you do, can capture your passwords if they want, and you&#039;re not connecting securely to a hidden service.&nbsp; &nbsp;The admins at onion.to can&#039;t see your real source IP if you&#039;re using Tor, but they can definitely see everything you see and steal your credentials if they want to.<br /><br />This needs to be second nature for anyone connecting to hidden services.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can&#039;t search Startpage, Google, etc, and expect to find direct links to .onion sites.&nbsp; &nbsp; They&#039;re going to show you links to onion.to sites, since the normal web can get to hidden services that way.<br /><br />I&#039;m not picking on the OP (hell, everybody makes a mistake), but I&#039;m somewhat surprised that everyone else didn&#039;t know immediately what happened to the OP.&nbsp; &nbsp;onion.to is not a secure way to visit hidden sites.&nbsp;

				And to be very clear:&nbsp; If you typed a password into a onion.to link for a hidden service, you need to go directly to that service, by it&#039;s .onion address (not it&#039;s onion.to address), and CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD NOW.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know that the onion.to folks are up to anything, but you&#039;d be foolish to put yourself in the position where you have to trust them.

				<br />my god, thanks for pointing out<br /><br />i just change all my password, thankfully homepage is set at https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en-US&amp;small=1&amp;uptodate=0 so it tells me every time i am connected to tor succesfuly<br /><br />also just once again checked what my ip was showing and it was of tor<br /><br />i have never accessed tor with my normal browser through onion.to or whatever, never will do that also<br /><br />i think this should be a sticky for newbies out there - NEVER ACCESS TOR WEBSITES FROM .TO Links<br /><br />Also i just realise - how many people have .to links in their signatures - seems like a lot of people dont know about this - even vendors have .to links in their profiles as signatures

				The [.to] gateway does censor questionable content. I don&#039;t even think you get the Hidden Wiki on [.to].<br /><br />However, [.tor2web.org] does not not censor any content. If you accidentally end up on a site with illegal content, it can be traced back to your IP address. <br /><br />Either way, you have no anonymity. <br /><br />
