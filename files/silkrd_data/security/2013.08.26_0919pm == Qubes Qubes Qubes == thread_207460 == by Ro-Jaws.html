				Hey,<br />I am looking for some help with Qubes. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and on an everyday level the transfer was relatively painless (once I got my head around how templates relate to individual app VMs, a simple relationship but one that kept tripping me up for almost a week). <br /><br />Even some of the marginally more complex stuff went without a hitch (such as setting up a torVM, adding bridges creating a new disposable VM template etc). However I have a couple of things I want to clear up before I start using Qubes for browsing SR and this forum.<br /><br />The disposable VMs - they run entirely in RAM right? I know they check the savefile and then start but I read somewhere that when you open a specific file using a dispVM (like a PDF) any changes made are also made to the original so obviously I want to avoid this.<br /><br />Linked to this is the wiping of RAM, looking at TAILS I see they use smem to wipe the ram upon shutdown, at some point I would like to get to that but for now I am just looking to run it at all. I am assuming it should be run in dom0 to give it full access to the RAM, is this correct? <br /><br />Connected to this is the command for copying files to dom0, I cannot get this to work, it simply does nothing rather like most terminals when they are running a process, has anyone used this command successfully?<br /><br />And finally (finally!) has anyone used the tbb_torless_launcher? It seems to work (as in I can access hidden services) but whenever I try to use the tor check site I get the message that the proxy is refusing connections.

				qubes is not a safe OS to use, its permanent not live like tails so if anything does get into your main OS then the whole system is fucked until u wipe the drive. That and its a pain in the ass to configure and your whole system is locked to one computer, u cant take it with u like tails.

It isn&#039;t mentioned in any of the documentation that I&#039;ve dug up (which is unfortunately sparse):<br /><br />http://qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/DisposableVms<br />http://qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/UserDoc/DispVMCustomization<br />http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/06/disposable-vms.html<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not running Qubes right now because the hard drive crashed on the old laptop that I was testing it on, but you should be able to look at the properties of the dispvm in the VM Manager and see whether / how much disk storage space it has been assigned.<br /><br />A VM that runs only in RAM would be preferred, but I suppose it&#039;s not a big problem if you use full disk encryption.

IDK. I heard DDR3 memory decays very quickly anyway, so cold boot attacks are not very effective on it. All I can find about this issue re Qubes was this message from the qubes-devel mailing list:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&gt; Also, they wipe the memory on<br />&gt; shutdown to prevent data being held in RAM upon reboot. Would these<br />&gt; features be of use in Qubes to further enhance security?<br />&gt;<br /><br />Right now (Qubes 1.0) we&#039;re not addressing any of the physical attacks<br />(such as Cold Boot, or Evil Maid). We really need a good trusted boot<br />for this, such as perhaps Intel TXT, which howover is still unsupported<br />on majority of laptops, and this is planned for Qubes 2.0 branch.<br /><br />So, no.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And then this roadmap:<br /><br />http://qubes-os.org/trac/roadmap<br /><br />which says that the trusted boot / anti-evil mail stuff won&#039;t be added until Qubes version 3, meaning it could be a few years before they include a memory wipe feature.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Connected to this is the command for copying files to dom0, I cannot get this to work, it simply does nothing rather like most terminals when they are running a process, has anyone used this command successfully?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I haven&#039;t tried this, but cat with redirection is supposed to do nothing in the terminal.

Can you get to check.torproject.org in a regular browser (through the TorVM)? If so, then maybe the script is blocking everything but onion addresses, which seems strange. Can you paste it here?

So when someone is at your door, power off the computer (resetting it is probably not enough) and turn it on again to wipe the memory.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207460.msg1493678#msg1493678">Quote from: Kiwikiikii on August 26, 2013, 11:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">qubes is not a safe OS to use, its permanent not live like tails so if anything does get into your main OS then the whole system is fucked until u wipe the drive.

Though I&#039;ve had too many headaches with encrypted bootable Linux systems on USB sticks recently, so I won&#039;t test that. Unless you use USB3 it can be extremely annoying because it&#039;s so slow under certain circumstances.<br />

You could also create your own Qubes-like OS on ramdisk using debian+xen...<br /><br />The system would have to be created and then mounted read only, with as much as possible of it mounted on a ramdisk (/home, /tmp and the like). <br /><br />Idealy the whole system would be stored encrypted and extracted at boot on several RAM partitions... <br /><br />Do you guys see any way to easily extract/mount a whole system on a ramdisk?<br /><br />

Of course, an attacker might identify you in many ways not related to exploiting your OS, so they plan on physical defenses in the future.<br /><br />OTOH, Tails assumes there is a high probability you will be physically attacked and your best defense is to leave no trace of your activities. (That is a reasonable assumption for its original user base, political dissidents at internet cafes in repressive regimes.)<br /><br />We all want both defenses: the strongest isolation to protect against exploits and identification, and the best security against physical attacks, but no preconfigured solution offers that right now. Qubes looks the most promising going forward, since they mention defenses against physical attacks in their future milestones, while it doesn&#039;t look like Tails has any plans to add VM isolation.<br /><br />

Yes its not isolated, so if u get pwned then for that session u get pwned, but seriously if you are browsing the net with JS enabled then you&#039;d probably enter the session with all your shit locked down anyways. As for qubes sure u have a persistent OS that isolates everything so the odds of getting hacked are minimal, but from a security standpoint both approaches have the same net effect as long as you know what you are doing. <br /><br />Id pick tails just because its portable (and easy to backup) and doesnt leave any traces. FDE isnt going to help if some pious judge threatens you with contempt.

Wiping the thumb drive every now and then and installing a fresh system might (partly) solve the problem; a way to create an image and load everything in ram would be better. But you&#039;d have to build a new system each time you want to apply a security upgrade.<br /><br />Keeping in ram only the folders/partitions where temp/log/whatever files can/will be written could be a solution. Some work would be needed to create such a list...

				The USB sticks in my tutorials are not bootable though. I will create a tutorial how to install Whonix on a partly encrypted live (bootable) Xubuntu stick soon. 8GB quality (fast) USB stick and 4GB RAM is enough.&nbsp; With it you&#039;d have the portability of persistent Tails with the additional protection of an (software) isolated virtual machine and Tor entry guards. Speed is acceptable with fast USB2 sticks.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">USB-bootable Whonix (possibly with Tor running on host OS and not in separate VM)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suggest using the Whonix gateway in a virtual machine instead, unless you intend to install the Whonix gateway as host OS. It can be quite some work to make a fresh install of a Linux distro as secure and hardly fingerprintable as the Whonix gateway.
