				Some Antivirus products have started detecting unmodified Tor executable as a Virus in response to this botnet:<br /><br />https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/94fe0e8a61c506fba45d14571a14dc259e1d52778cef8366ce8cbdcd871e28db/analysis/1378462188/

				Sigh.<br />LE is tricksey.<br />Hard to shake users trust of vendors with our review system and scam watchers, psy-ops have limited effect here.<br />Between the NSA revelations, bitcoin being targeted by governments, TOR de-anonymizing whitepapers and this botnet, only the carefully dedicated and the stupid are still here.

				This botnet is a huge problem to the stability and integrity of the Tor network. Typically a botnet out on the clear internet is almost impossible to shut down but in this case it seems that the person responsible is using a hidden service as his command and control center for the botnets which makes the task of stopping this botnet even that more impossible. The Tor developers patched up and added some new protocols for Tor relays that they have made a slight improvement but still there&#039;s no clear answer. Looking at the mailing lists a lot of bright people are working on some solutions so it looks promising but as I said botnets are a problem that some of the greatest minds in security can&#039;t figure out a 100% foolproof solution. As soon as you cut off the head of one then another just replaces it. The only true way to shut it down is to trace it back to the command and control center. The good side of all of this is that the Tor network got some free stress testing and it actually stood it&#039;s ground, so there&#039;s that.
