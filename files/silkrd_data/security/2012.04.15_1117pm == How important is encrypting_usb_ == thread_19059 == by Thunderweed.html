				Just wondering, from a small personal amount buyer&#039;s perspective, is it really worth it to look into all this computer encryption stuff? Of course it&#039;s always nicer to be safer, but I don&#039;t really see the point. If cops bust into my house because of a pack (even if they are allowed to), I don&#039;t think they are allowed to check out my computer and shit?<br /><br />Maybe this stuff is just for big-time buyers/vendors?

				It takes literally a second to encrypt your information, better safe than sorry I always say! and yes the cops can and will take your hard drive apart if need be.

				you would use an ecryption software to partition a portion of the usb drive, decrypt, then load all progz on to the encrypted portion of yer drive<br /><br />Be Safe out There Kids

I might sound lazy when I say that though, but I wasn&#039;t sure if it was worth all the effort. Using PGP for addresses is always necessary though, I think, though I&#039;ve actually been somewhat lazy with that lately :/. Time to cut the slack, I think.

				Imagine sitting in a cell for a week. Honestly imagine it. Now imagine years. It&#039;s worth it to use truecrypt (found here: http://www.truecrypt.org/) and let it run overnight/while you&#039;re not using your computer to encrypt the HDD so that in the small chance your shit&#039;s taken you&#039;re safe.<br /><br />You&#039;re trafficking drugs across state lines. That&#039;s a federal felony. Don&#039;t fuck around with your freedom.

A small price to pay for your peace of mind. Admittedly LE aren&#039;t interested in small time buyers but if they did go after a large seller and found he&#039;d been shipping to you, they might raid your place on the offchance of finding something incriminating.<br /><br />In short it is always, always important to encrypt.<br /><br />V.
