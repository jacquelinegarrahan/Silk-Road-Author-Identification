			<dd class="postbody">
				Me and a friend were having a lengthy discussion last night about how to more safely import stuff into Australia.<br />Our biggest concern was getting a P.O. box. Looking through the application sheet http://auspost.com.au/media/documents/pobox-application-form-jan-2012.pdf <br />Our biggest concern was we didn&#039;t want to provide our IDs, on the application, it says photo id; drivers license, or two bills or something showing an address. <br />I&#039;m crowd sourcing knowledge here because we can into a brick wall here.<br />Should we apply for a ABN would that be a better idea rather than using a person, or just take a look around a couple of mailboxes and find two bills to the same person? Or applying for an ABN using different identifications. I dont mind going into the post office and being on camera. <br />My friend has access to scaned documents and driver&#039;s licenses is it possible to do this application online and just send a jpg of a drivers license (i know that one is proably really stupid). But we were on substances last night and talked about this for a long time without coming up for a good way of getting an anoymous P.O. box.<br />Bascially after about 3 hours talking about it, we came up with very little in the way of getting a truly anoymous P.O. box in australia. Could SR provide me with some options here, or ideas or anything please.

				Hmm, thanks for that ^<br />I too have been researching PO boxes for a couple hours, not talking as no one is knowledgeable around me :|<br />Anyways, I&#039;ve read on whirlpool forums you need 100point ID, though their application says just a picture and address with ID on it too.<br /><br />Out of all my researching, I&#039;ve ended up hitting the &#039;go talk to your local po box supplier&#039;<br /><br />Go into more detail into this ABN business, I&#039;d like to think about that.<br />I do remember reading a post on here which said, you should start a small internet busniess or media page, and have your PO box for business mail on it.<br />It&#039;s kind of like a safe-gaurd, so you can say you receive mail from custmers, busniesses, fans.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m very keen on informatoin, I&#039;ve searched these forums and lived through 2 Australian shipping threads, and there&#039;s not much info honestly.<br />It&#039;s all dodgy and contradicting, some people say one thing.. others say the oppisite.<br /><br />So yeah, someone with info, please post!<br />

				I contemplated getting a PO box when I first started using the road back in Jan, but decided against it, instead I&#039;ve got 2 different residential addresses, 1 for a 70 yo ex user, who knows exactly what I&#039;m shippoing there and charges me $20 per package! The other address is a long time friend who doesn&#039;t use drugs and lets me ship there for free! His words &quot;I&#039;ve never used drugs and they can test me if they like. I&#039;ll just say nothing, you&#039;re cool man!&quot;

				I don&#039;t trust anyone :P ^<br />I got to find something like that, people live in my house too, so after getting something shipped here once, I felt pretty bad for &#039;betraying&#039; them.<br /><br />Fuck, I might just pay someone $20 as well to get something shipped to their house.<br />I&#039;ll start asking around.. :P

				Damn, that really sucks, need to have a drivers license then? Like i said earlier, i have access to photocopied driver&#039;s licenses (usually very old people nursing home types) could the application be done by proxy or online? Might call up the post office and inquire into this myself, just curious as to what you guys think is that a viable option?

				$20 to have a few hundy worth delivered colse by but not to your door? I think it&#039;s a small investment, but worthy!

				I think PO box might work if you COULD get it in a false name, but then you combine drug traffiking with identity fraud!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s the whole &quot;risk Vs reward&quot; argument!

				Get an ABN, set up a music website (stream some unknown songs from a shit band no one has heard of and claim that they&#039;re your band) then put up your PO Box on the main page for fan mail, interview, bookings etc. Rock fans can be pretty wreckless and I&#039;m sure there is a history of fans sending in dope to their idols.
