				I have used bitinstant until now,&nbsp; but with all the problems and the 500 limit, I am going to try sugamama and go with a moneypak.&nbsp; &nbsp;(she charges 10%)<br /><br />Now I have looked at the cards and they have a 1k limit,&nbsp; but they can be reloaded,&nbsp; so what I am wondering is if you can put the thousand on there, then double back in line, and put on a couple hundred extra?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I am needing right at a thousand, so looks like I will need to have at least 1200, would rather not do it on 2 cards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anybody know?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.

				I am pretty sure that you don&#039;t do anything with the cards..you buy card refills. These have limits (I think $500 or $1100 through walmart) but you can buy as many as you like.<br /><br />-mm

				From what I&#039;ve heard, it makes it much easier for the vendor if you give them smaller denomination cards.&nbsp; (like two $500 MPs rather than one $1k)

				yeah scout your probably right,&nbsp; however with a 10% on each mp,&nbsp; it is much better for me if I can get it all on one.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				If they are charging percentage than that will be the same whether the total sum is in one moneypak or multiple ones.<br /><br />-mm

				Ohhhhhhhh, yeah about that. <br /><br />What I didn&#039;t say was that anything 500 and above is 10%&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />However below 500 is 12%.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below 400 is 14%&nbsp; <br /><br />And so on and so forth down 100 which is 20%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose none of that matters as long as I stay at 500 tho.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks everyone for the replies.
