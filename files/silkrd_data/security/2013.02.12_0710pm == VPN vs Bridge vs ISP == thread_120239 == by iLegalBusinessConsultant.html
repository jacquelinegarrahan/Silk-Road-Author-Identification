			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve read a lot of threads on the forums discussing the use accessing TOR via a VPN or a bridge and I am confused. There have been lots of differing opinions on both sides of the aisle on whether one should use a VPN to connect to TOR or use a bridge to connect to TOR or simply using your regular ISP to connect to TOR is enough. <br /><br />Could we get a definitive answer to this debate? What is the best way to anonymously connect to TOR so that no one can see that you are connecting to TOR at the connection point? Please look at it from a SR buyer perspective and a SR vendor perspective, where the risks are much greater. I, like many of the newbies are not tech people. A untechy explanation would be greatly appreciated. And I apologize if this debate opens up a whole can of worms&nbsp; :P but I just would like to get a definitive answer to the whole question of how to not be seen connecting to TOR.

				Neither a bridge nor a VPN offer perfect security, because<br /><br />1. Bridges can be identified (although it is difficult to enumerate all of them because of the way they are distributed)<br /><br />2. VPNs can see your entire connection, who you are (your IP address) and where you&#039;re going (the destination IP address). Even if they don&#039;t log right now, they could be compelled by LE to log your activity.<br /><br />However, the way to look at it is that each piece offers an additional layer of security.<br /><br />So, VPN + bridge + Tor &gt; bridge + Tor&nbsp; or&nbsp; VPN + Tor &gt; just Tor<br /><br />For the best (but not perfect) hiding of your Tor activity, get a VPN in a foreign country (to maximize jurisdictional issues), AND configure your Tor client to use an obfsproxy bridge.<br /><br /><br />Actually, there&#039;s an even better solution, but it&#039;s more difficult to implement. Rent a VPS anonymously in another country and turn it into a private (unpublished) obfsproxy bridge. Someone watching your local internet connection won&#039;t know what the hell it is. It won&#039;t show up in the list of bridges if they enumerate those, and won&#039;t show up as a known VPN or proxy provider. The connection won&#039;t even look like a Tor connection (although the hand shake will, at least until obfs3 comes out). It will simply look like a box at a random hosting provider.

				Actually the risks are much greater for a vendor who has more to lose and whose location can be gleaned through correlation attacks.<br /><br />That aside using a bridge doesnt hide the fact you are connected to tor because simple protocol analysis can determine that you are still sending tor traffic, and bridges are publicly broadcasted. Using a VPN *can* hide tor usage because it usually offers an end to end encrypted tunnel, that is instead of connecting directly to the tor servers, you initiate a encrypted connection to a VPN (a paid proxy) who then send your connection on through tor. At that first hop between you&lt;-&gt;ISP&lt;-&gt;VPN not only if your tor data encrypted via tor (the data you are trying to keep secret), but that encrypted connection is encrypted through the VPN. At this point the VPN wont offer you better protection from traffic analysis as you are essentially &quot;double bagging&quot;, but it does cover the most obvious &quot;hey look im connecting to tor&quot; signals you initially send out when you connect to tor.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now lets say were talking specifically about connecting to hidden services, whereas connecting to a clearnet site opens you open to possible MitM attacks from exit nodes snooping in on unencrypted traffic, or redirecting you to spoof sites, or governments spoofing SSL certs to snoop in on your https traffic...connecting to a hidden service doesnt involve exit nodes, therefore your traffic stays encrypted throughout the chain and isnt subject to spoofing or snooping. It also frees you from timing attacks, that is assuming the hidden service your connecting to isnt controlled by a global adversary, for instance if you connected to a clearnet site the owner of said site could be made to give up server logs and then it could be correlated that you (assuming you are the target of investigation at this point) sent a request via tor and shortly thereafter a request was received at the site through an exit node, but hidden services are often just that, hidden, and the likelihood of the sites operator being an adversary or being found and compelled to give up server logs is unlikely, and even then would only be circumstantial evidence as part of a larger case.<br /><br />The only other option besides VPN&#039;s for masking tor usage is a project called obfsproxy which aims to combine the use of bridges (once again a deeply flawed strategy) with protocol obfuscation, that is making tor look more like http traffic. Its still in its early stages and not being a security researcher have no idea how one would prove its effectiveness. This i assume would require some in depth knowledge on ISP&#039;s deep packet inspection technologies and protocol analysis techniques.<br /><br />Here, this graphic helps in understanding the flow of tor, just imagine the VPN in this case is an additional encrypted proxy that sits between you and the first first relay (technically between your isp and the first relay but traffic is still destined towards the VPN in the ISP&#039;s eyes instead of tor).<br /><br />https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https

The only point in having a VPN is to keep your ISP from knowing the next location you are trying to connect to (ie tor). Ironically Tor works in the same way, just no so effectively as to keep your ISP/VPN/Whatever from knowing that you&#039;re using it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For the best (but not perfect) hiding of your Tor activity, get a VPN in a foreign country (to maximize jurisdictional issues), AND configure your Tor client to use an obfsproxy bridge.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Congratulations, you just suggested a 5-hop proxy circuit.

				Yes, but my point is that if you&#039;re trying to hide the fact that you&#039;re using Tor, a VPN adds a layer of obfuscation, but a determined adversary can still get around it.<br /><br />They look at your internet connection and see you connecting to a VPN provider in Sweden. They contact Swedish LE who send a request to log your activity. They get logs which show you are connecting to Tor relays.<br /><br />That may not be your threat model. Maybe LE doesn&#039;t want to put the work into figuring out what you are accessing through that VPN if it means spending months negotiating with foreign LE. Maybe they ordered packages from you (an SR vendor) which were postmarked in your town, so they asked your ISP for accounts that were accessing Tor, and naturally since you were using a VPN, your account info was not turned over. Maybe that lead them to waste time investigating other people. <br /><br />Each layer is a barrier that makes LE&#039;s job harder, but keep in mind my original point. It&#039;s not a perfect solution and a determined adversary, especially with the force of the state behind it, can get around a VPN.<br /><br />Just ask those Anonymous guys who were using HideMyAss.<br />

				thanks for the great answers. So what I&#039;m getting out of this convo is that although there is no perfect way to hide the fact you are using TOR, in order to resonably put some extra steps between you and LE is to use a VPN in a country not friendly to your own, connect to TOR, but don&#039;t bother with bridges. Cool, so that will be my setup! Sorry I couldn&#039;t get a hold of the obsfproxy you guys were talking about. That&#039;s more of an advanced lesson I guess.<br /><br />Now what are you guys saying about this mi-fi? How could I get a disposable smart phone and connect to TOR using that? This would be like the equivalent of a street dealer and his throw away phone.<br /><br />

				i guess it depends on what browser your using, but i think dns leaks were a problem...?&nbsp; orbot wont do transparent on my rooted phone.&nbsp; and cant stand the orweb browser, not sure how secure opera is using tor, but its a better browser :/ <br />id just stick to tor browser bundles.&nbsp; open source of course :D<br /><br />edit:&nbsp; <br />&quot;Additionally, the Android web browser does not have Torbutton. This means that while it may be useful for circumvention, it probably is unsuitable for strong web browser anonymity requirements. &quot;<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />its at the bottom.<br /><br />and <br />&nbsp;&quot;We don&#039;t support IE, Opera or Safari and never plan to.
