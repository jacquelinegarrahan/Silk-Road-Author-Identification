				First let me start by saying I HAVE NOT done this yet and am just looking for some opinions.<br /><br />I thought about it though, and even if you get a PO box with false information, that&#039;s not going to stop the authorities from arresting you once you retrieve your illegal package from the box, will it? I feel like then they will find out you aren&#039;t John Smith and then you&#039;ve got another federal case with fake id/po box fraud, etc.<br /><br />I understand that using fake information is &quot;safer&quot; in terms of a bad situation getting back to you/coming to your house/etc but I feel like it wouldn&#039;t stop the feds from watching you get your shit from inside the post office.<br /><br /><br />Maybe I have not read all the information in the PO box argument, but at first thought fake information on a PO box is just adding to a federal case if shit hits the fan/controlled delivery.<br /><br />Anyone like to comment or educate me more on the real vs. fake PO box information?<br /><br />For now I&#039;m sticking to a residential address.....

				using a fake id box has the pros of being disposable if a vendor gets busted, the site shuts down, tracking goes dead, etc...but as you mentioned if caught you definitely will be facing a more serious charge. this is something that&#039;s been debated to death on the forum but it seems more veteran members swear by it. at that point, they should have contacts to vendors with long reputation, and good shipping practice that they feel comfortable doing the amounts that they do. i wouldn&#039;t want to give my personal information to a drug dealer either. would you?<br /><br />these guys work outside of escrow a lot too, so if one already paid upfront and it&#039;s arrived at the box i would suggest waiting a few days and leaving it sit at first. maybe do some counter surveillence to deem it safe or not.

				ahhh yes I seemed to have overlooked the fact that some of these vendors may not dispose of your information properly or quickly. Most of my orders have been with overseas MDMA vendors for quantities under 10g. I feel my information could be similar to hundreds of others. Could overseas authorities really hunt down 300 people who ordered something around the world? Maybe, and I see why fake information could be justified, however like I said, if they really wanted to see what you were up to they&#039;d probably just scoop you right from the&nbsp; post office.<br /><br />Anyone else have any input, real vs. fake info on a PO box?

				You guys are being way too paranoid as long as you&#039;re not buying bulk supplies of marijuana more than a pound a week or buying heroin or cocaine in large amounts you really have nothing to worry about besides the accidental postal worker discovering your package by sheer coincidence.<br /><br />&nbsp;you should not rent the PO box in a fake name unless you are doing one of the four mentioned quantities you do not want to Comment a bigger crime. To cover a smaller Crime.<br /><br />&nbsp;you want to do this the other way around Commit a smaller Crime to cover a larger Crime<br /><br />&nbsp;i.e. cocaine heroine large amounts of marijuana<br />Just my two cents

				I agree! Maybe if you got a bunch of junk mail/catalogs sent to your PO box SR packages would blend in well. <br /><br />Another thing I thought about as well, and keep in mind I am unfamiliar with a post office/PO box, How many other PO boxes are in your average post office? I feel like you could blend in well especially if there are 100+, your just a random guy getting his mail. Does the post office keep a picture record of you that the feds could use to pick you off as you get your package? I suppose they are the feds and will get a picture any way they please if they really wanted to investigate/watch you.<br /><br />Also, what about writing &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package/letter as you get it from the box? Maybe they couldn&#039;t make a case out of it cause you didn&#039;t know what was inside or never opened. However if you were to actually return the pack, you would give it to the postman at the post office, so maybe that wouldn&#039;t really work too well......

				Think of it this way, if you use your real ID to open that PO Box, if anything illegal is seized, they&#039;ll just come pay you a friendly visit. But if your PO Box is under a false ID, they have no option except simply to sit there and wait for you to show up. Except - Law Enforcement simply do not have the resources to babysit that PO Box, 24/7 for a small amount of drunks- unless of course, you&#039;ve been dealing nuclear secrets with Pakistan using that PO Box.<br /><br />Always wait a few days before picking it up. Do it away from business hours (if it 24/7 PO Box); or do it during rush hour in the morning.

				it you get busted with a fake po box they charge u with defrauding the us gov this is a very serious crime a lot more serious than receiving personal amounts of drugs through the mail system in fact if you were to get busted they would drop the drug charges and hang you out to dry on the defrauding the government charges.<br /><br />I know for a fact that the post office take this crime very seriously more seriously than shipping drugs shipping drugs the United States Postal Service has been going on for 20+ years this is not new to them in fact you could say they are completely numb to the crime itself that&#039;s why you never hear of anybody getting busted for personal amounts of drugs unless it&#039;s OxyContin&#039;sthey can not stand these and they will go all out to bust you if they find you doing in them heroin also think okay and last but not least marijuana but only in large amounts I would say anything over a pound of weed would be origin investigation anything under would just go into the drug vault then you may or may not receive a love letter basically telling you that they confiscated illegal drugs being mailed to you.<br /><br />The procedure for the post office when they find illegal drugs is two things first they will catalog it and put it in the drug vault and not a be all with that case.<br /><br />Or they will do what is called a controlled delivery where they will try to get you to sign for the package regardless if it&#039;s in your name or not.<br /><br />If you have a PO Box there will be a slip in the PO box instead of your package of drugs the slip will ask you to come to the counter to pick up your package when you get to the counter they&#039;re going to try to get you to sign for the package if I was you I would act like everything is normal like I was going to sign for the package look at the package notice that it is not in your name and say this is not my package I don&#039;t know who this belongs to and refused to sign for the package.<br /><br />This is the United States of American you cannot be charged for anything mail to you unless you take possession of that package.<br />The law clearly states that the United States Postal Service nor the police department in that area can deliver drugs to you they will not let you pick up that package and walk out of that store without you signing for any lawyer with any kind of grit would throw this case out of court before it even got to court if the package is not in your name and you do not open the package before they bust you then you cannot be held accountable for what is in the package this is why they do the controlled delivery you signing for the package is an admission of guilt if you never sign for the package then how in God&#039;s name are you to know what is in that package you don&#039;t at this point the officers are going to browbeat you into a confession you say to them and only save this to the no matter how mad they get no matter how many years of incarceration and big black cocks they threaten you with you say this in only this.<br /><br />Am I under arrest if I am under arrest I would like to speak with my attorney if I am not under arrest may I leave.<br /><br />Do not say anything else but that&#039;s you can repeat this 1 million times and they can never submit this in court only testimonial evidence that can be admissible in court can only be gathered after your rights have been read to you.<br /><br />So again say nothing but what is listed above during question two things will happen they will falsely arrest you this has happened then you will hang them out to dry in court because you have broken no laws.<br /><br />For the cops get incredibly pissed off at you then let you get this is what happens 99% of the time.<br /><br />Do not be scared of the cops they are trained to intimidate you if you think they won&#039;t lie you&#039;re kidding yourself they can use every lie in the book to get a confession out of you do not talk to the pigs ever.<br /><br />Just my two cents gentlemen of course I read all of this here on silk road forms in the security section

I suppose they might use the federal (USA) drug laws to judge this, even though many substances are an automatic felony. Lots of grey areas here.......

				I know there are some good replies here so bear with me if it sounds like im repeating anything.<br /><br />I feel like I am against the PO Box as a delivery method. I dont know what veterans you are talking about who are more comfortable with it but honestly the issue here is being able to blend in. A random envelope sending you a small amount of whatever the hell you ordered to your mailbox will most certainly not throw up any flags.<br /><br />If you are looking to order more than just a personal amount, perhaps a PO Box is also not for you, consider that PO Box addresses have to be personally given out or published (no personal tax record or google maps for a po box, much harder to just send whatever to this box for some random) and what you are going for expecially in a US Case if anything were to happen is plausable deniability. <br /><br />Of course thats just the legal side, obviously how a drug case effects your personal life is completely different, but to minimize the risks try to blend in as much as possible and don&#039;t order insane amounts unless you are ready for the risk.<br /><br />A gram hell even ounce really isn&#039;t even that much to hide if you think about it. Good vendors with PGP on sensitive information always.<br /><br />These vendors want to make money and they want to keep making money so the longer more established vendors have a responsibility to themselves to also minimize risk.<br /><br />Just my small rant I guess, it&#039;s super important that vendors and buyers work together to keep the site running well if we are going to enjoy it in the future.

				Some interesting responses that I mostly agree with.<br /><br />A residential address is my current method and will stay that way unless I can find a better address. A PO box just seems like you could be indirectly involving more people in your SR purchases than need be. Lets just hope the sellers can continue to use innovative packaging and get those larger orders through customs with minimal consequences if found. Although I do find it strange how there are very few undocumented cases on here of people getting the knock and talk or controlled delivery despite a large amount of orders allegedly not arriving. Either customs just doesn;t give a fuck or vendors aren&#039;t sending??<br /><br />A friend received a love letter for some XTC pills a few months back. The letter came nearly 2 months after the order was shipped, which I found was strange. Rumor had it the vendor&#039;s packaging was not too stealthy, as the seized order was only 10 pills.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to talk to (without consequence of course) a customs person or LE officer who works with mail seizures and what the REAL and KNOWN procedure is as of recently. Honestly, all we can do on here is speculate and get hints that may not even be true.<br /><br />Oh well, I love this place and will continue to get my contraband via this site. Shit most of the stuff on here blows the local product out of the water anyway!!

				I sometimes use i mailbox rental. Not a po box but a small ma and pa shipping company owned by former ups, fedex worker. They mind their own business and are too swamped anyway to look at my packs. I have 24hr access and it is easy to counter survail going in. I got shit from amazon sent there and some of my business packages which helps all blend in well. My amounts are always personal though I don&#039;t buy to deal ever.
