				Ok, so a while ago i was looking for a GPG app for the iPhone. Since I already have a Tor browser for it (Onion Browser) I thought it would be useful. I am away from my computer most days and only can use GPG at night. This means if I need to communicate with a vendor it takes a day for each message/reply cycle, causing me potentially to have to wait longer for my drugs. Not ideal I think you will agree.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I found two, one a official Symnatec PGP which requires you to already own PGP official software. The other was a low budget job that couldnt import the keys I wanted so no good.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However in the course of my research I discovered that my jailbroken phone already has a command line GnuPG installed as part of the Cydia software. At the time I left it alone but now I have got my head round it.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: if perfect security is important to you its probably best to stick to established methods. I am happy to use this as I am only a small time personal buyer.<br /><br />First to check you have this package: Open Cydia&gt;Manage&gt;packages and switch to &#039;expert&#039; setting. It should show up under the g&#039;s. I assumed it came with Cydia but it may have installed as a dependency for some other package I installed.<br /><br />To use it you will need Mobile Terminal (install latest version from xsellize repo) and iFile. Also a SSH program on your PC will be handy. I use iFunbox; it has a stupid name but is the most useful.<br /><br />Open Mobile Terminal. You do not need root privileges to use this. Type:<br /><br />gpg<br /><br />This will set up your pub and sec keyrings and a .conf file. These are in /var/mobile. in a folder .GnuPG which is invisible to iFile for some reason but will show up in iFunbox.<br /><br />From now on any file will be put in /var/mobile. I dont know if this is vital but it seems to make sense to me. <br /><br />To import your secret key, export it as a .asc file from your current GPG program. Put the .asc file in /var/mobile. You will probably want to shorten its name to something more managable: seckey.asc<br /><br />Open Mobile Terminal and type<br /><br />gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import seckey.asc<br /><br />this will add your public and private keys to your keyring.<br /><br />To import a public key:<br /><br />gpg --import pubkey.asc&nbsp; &nbsp;(where pubkey is the name of the file)<br /><br />If you want you can create a file in /var/mobile using iFile called &quot;pubkey.asc&quot; and just copy/paste the public key block into it.<br /><br />So now you have your private keys and whoevers public keys you want, to see them type<br /><br />gpg --list-keys<br /><br />gpg --list-secret-keys<br /><br />This will show a list of keys with User Names.<br /><br />Ok, now to encrypt a message.<br /><br />Create a file in /var/mobile. Call it msg.asc<br />Copy/paste or type your message in this file.<br /><br />then in MT type<br /><br />gpg -e -a -r &quot;recipients user name&quot; msg.asc<br /><br />the -a tells it to encrypt the text within the file and output another .asc file. If you dont use this it will treat the file as data and encrypt it to a .gpg file which is no good to us. (it is fairly easygoing about user names; it will recognise a small portion, like for me &quot;hungry&quot; would do)<br /><br />Return to /var/mobile in iFile. There will be a file called msg.asc.asc which will contain encrypted text which you can copy/paste to wherever you want it.<br /><br />To decrypt a message:<br /><br />Again, create msg.asc file in /var/mobile. Copy/paste encrypted text to it.<br /><br />Open MT. type:<br /><br />gpg -d -a msg.asc<br /><br />you will be prompted for passphrase, then it will output in MT.<br /><br />If you want it to output to a file:<br /><br />gpg -o output.asc -d -a msg.asc<br /><br />this will output to a file called output.asc<br /><br />Obviously you can use whatever filenames suit you.<br /><br />I think this also works with .txt files but since it outputs to .asc I thought keep it simple.<br /><br />There is obviously a lot more to command line GPG but this is a quick and dirty start up. <br />I am fed up typing now, will add more perhaps later. If anyone else would like to contribute who has more expertise in command line GPG I would welcome advice and help.<br /><br />I have already found this very useful. It might be an idea to delete public keys when not in use....<br /><br />gpg --delete-key &quot;User name&quot;<br /><br />...nothing worse than being caught with drugs in your letterbox and a SR vendors PGP key in your iPhone, i <br />imagine.<br /><br />Edit: I have found it useful to leave two files in var/mobile <br />One called msg.asc for messages<br />One called key.asc for keys<br /><br />You can then create shortcuts in mobile terminal for many basic functions using these files to copy paste messages or keys to. This saves a lot of typing. <br />I don&#039;t think that having GPG set up for use on your phone is in itself suspicious as long as you don&#039;t leave vendors keys on key rings. A casual examination of the phone by your average policeman isn&#039;t even going to show it. You&#039;d have to assume phone being seized and examined by experts. Which I hope won&#039;t happen at my level of small personal transactions.

				forgot to mention:<br />you can also generate a keypair:<br /><br />gpg --gen-key<br /><br />it will walk you through process.<br /><br />Also, to export a public key to a file called &quot;key.asc&quot;<br /><br />gpg --export -a &quot;user name&quot;&gt;key.asc<br /><br />You can then copy/paste it for example to the bottom of your message. I keep a copy of my public key for this purpose.
