				Bitinstant is done for silkroad use. You have to know imformation related to the indentity you are using. It&#039;s actual real questions. They also state somewhere on their website that the site doesn&#039;t work with tor browser. Sketchy.

If you put in your name it will ask you questions like who is your father in multiple choice format and your dad will be one of the choices without you even telling them. What address did you last live at out of these addresses pick one. It asks these regardless. kind of like a credit score.

				I made a account today.. Bitcoins r legal.. there not gonna know where the wallet is the coins go to.. Im gonna use them one more run sometimee this month. <br /><br />I did have to answer some of my porsonal info, but if you know someone really really well you can use their info, U CANT MAKE UP FAKE INFO AT ALL what u put in has to be someones real info.. I MADE an account in my name and one in my cousions. I have his ss# DOB i know everyting about him we grew up as brothers.<br /><br /><br />they asked me about a suzuki intruder 700 bike i had in 1999!!! and a old zip code where i use to live.. but iv never used TOR for bitinstant,, why? its legal. you can buy many things with bitcoins that r legal.<br /><br />EVEN on SR their is laptops,a XBOX HARD DRIVES ETC.. NO ONE CAN PROVE YOUR BUYING DRUGS.. <br /><br />I didnt see a guest account anymore eaither though.. I think bitcoin is still fine to use.. by the time the coins tumble and they make it to your SR account, MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT RITE OFF ,THEN MAKE A NEW BUYER PROFILE, SEND THE COINS TO THE NEW BUYER ACCOUNT THEN ONCE YOUR NEW ACCOUNT HAS BEEN MADE ONYOUR NORML SR ACCOUNT SEND THE $ BACK...

				It kinda gives me the feeling big brother is watching.&nbsp; Why put in all that personal info now?&nbsp; It worked before, why try to fix something that wasn&#039;t broken?&nbsp; Then, if someone were to put in daily orders for coins they could potentially know something is up.&nbsp; Very sketchy.

				It works fine with Tor for me.&nbsp; To use it anonymously you need to create an account in a real persons name, just someone other than yourself obviously.&nbsp; There is a bunch of states that it does not work at all in, regardless of if you have a verified account or not, Jack n Hoff posted a thread listing the states, because they have not registered as money transmitters with the state yet.

				I had the same exact problem as you. I went back and fourth with support for hours I really wanted it to work and I needed Bitcoin. Bitinstant tech support ended up on giving up on me and my situation and I gave up as well.<br /><br />My advice use a different service Mtgox is a mess and they don&#039;t care about you at this point. You are screwed you can try all you want I know cause I tried everything. <br /><br />I would suggest Campbx.

What they were doing (not verifying ID) might&#039;ve been technically illegal, in which case the government could&#039;ve shut down their company and thrown them in jail. It&#039;s the only possible incentive I can think of that would cause Bitinstant to take actions resulting in such a massive loss in profit (keep in mind, the updates to their website must&#039;ve been expensive). And the govt. pressure probably had nothing to do with SR, it was probably all about money laundering.

				you can have a friend make an account that doesn&#039;t buy stuff on SR. have them send the coins to a non sr wallet then transfer the coins to your sr account. but they do ask questions and there is no way of giving fake information. <br />But if you verify your identity you can have a $10,000 a day limit. So if you bought coin through bitinstant for 4%, you can make profit if you resell at 10, 12 or 15%
