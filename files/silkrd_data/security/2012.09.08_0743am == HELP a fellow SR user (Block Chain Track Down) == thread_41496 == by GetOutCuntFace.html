				Hey all,<br /><br />Ok so ultimately this is totally my own fault as I was steaming drunk last night BUT....<br /><br />So I had some BTC exchanged in MT GOX last night as I was waiting around for the exchange price to drop. It did and I traded...DONE<br /><br />I then, as far as I can remember split up the different denominations of BTC and sent them across to multiple InstaWallets and then on to SR....FINE.<br /><br />So now the one InstaWallet address I did not copy paste has turned up in my SR account. Yet the InstaWallet address which I did copy paste and can track via block chain has not shown up. I have no clue where that BTC has gone.<br /><br />What it boils down to is how the hell to I tell from Block Chain where the fuck that BTC went?!! I can see it was confirmed etc but I have never been that great on the BlockChain interface and how it gets split up and what useful data I am actually seeing. <br /><br />In my drunken stupor I would have thought I sent it on directly from there to my SR account, the other one worked, so basically what I am asking is how I use the BlockChain info I have of that BTC address to chase down where the hell it went and how to get it back!<br /><br />Please if anyone has any insight into this or has been retarded enough to do their trading whilst drunk please reply and help a fellow SR brethren out!<br /><br />Thanks!
