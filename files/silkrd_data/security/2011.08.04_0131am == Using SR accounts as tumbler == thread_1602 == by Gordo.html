				Hi,<br /><br />I know a lot of people used mybitcoin simply as a tumbler. By that I mean create lot&#039;s of accounts and use them to send the coins back and forth from all the different accounts...essentially sending them to yourself to obscure their history. Either for cashing out, or for people buying who (bad idea)&nbsp; go directly from mtgox/tradehill to SR wallet. <br /><br />Could something similar be done with multiple SR accounts? It would be convenient that&#039;s for sure, to just send coins to your different user accounts to mix them up and then withdraw them to a wallet. <br /><br />Any thoughts?

				If you have 2 computers in your house, download tor on each of them and then download the bitcoin wallet. I have 2 computers and have multiple wallets that I can use.

				Isn&#039;t it enough to send your coins to your SR account for tumbling/mixing ?<br />iirc that&#039;s what it does!

I never thought of this but, now that you bring it to my attention I realize its genius. I wish I would have thought of it earlier especially considering I just lost over 180BTC to mybitcoin.com while I was gone on vacation for 2 days -_-. But yes, this would work wonderfully. You would not even need 2 computers just simply click &quot;Use New Identity&quot; on the Tor cntrl panel between each xfer. Another option would be to have several virtual machines set-up on a single computer all with Tor installed on them but, in that case you wouldnt need several SR accounts but simply have the bitcoin.exe installed on all them. Same concept if you have separate computers. There is no need to use multiple SR accounts when you can simply have multiple wallets that can all, potentially, be backed up to a more secure place than even SR servers. <br /><br />RespectfullY<br /><br />-MR.

Its probably just a change in SR database values.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1602.msg12958#msg12958">Quote from: chronicpain on August 04, 2011, 03:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you have 2 computers in your house, download tor on each of them and then download the bitcoin wallet.

If you send them to an e-wallet you most probably get some other coins back and there is no direct connection to your old coins.

				^Really? But you get a new BTC address generated for each account so it&#039;s gotta be in the network. I mean the simple fact that you can send and withdraw BTC from or to a BTC address in SR tell me it is in the network.&nbsp; Would like some confirmation of this though.

				isn&#039;t it suffice to send ALL of your coins to a SR account, then send back to a new address ? the coins will be mixed with other coins in the SR pool!

It is on the network when you send Silk to Silk using the generated address. Most likely not when you just send user to user directly by just typing in the user name but, it is still a probability even then. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1602.msg13127#msg13127">Quote from: KarlM15 on August 04, 2011, 06:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">isn&#039;t it suffice to send ALL of your coins to a SR account, then send back to a new address ? the coins will be mixed with other coins in the SR pool!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And yes. The SR pool is definitely large enough to shuffle the coins effectively. This is a brilliant idea. And though I will never trust an internet based service to hold my coins again, even SR, I will definitely utilize this as a tumbler service and I would recommend everyone to as well. If many people start doing it though SR may start to charge a little commission for EVERY transaction through them. I mean why not?<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				I really wish SR would make its tumbler service more available to the gen public (i.e. not just people looking towards illicit activity) the more bitcoin that goes through the SR pool the harder it is for LE to do anything

				SR may already be doing exactly that! It will make it incredibly harder to track if SR used a main tumbler used by many other users as well, not just SR.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1872.0<br /><br />I hate to make a double post about this. Maybe someone should make a sticky? But I recently found out from SR directly that they do in fact tumble your coins while in SR. But I posted about this in the above linked thread. I thought this post was a great idea and I go into a bit more detail in the linked post. <br /><br />Thanks you SR!!!
