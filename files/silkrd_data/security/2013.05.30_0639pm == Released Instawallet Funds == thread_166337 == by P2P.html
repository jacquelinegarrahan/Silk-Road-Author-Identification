				I&#039;m wondering if anyone has heard back from IW on releasing their funds yet. I had in my mind June 1st but unfortunately I reread the e-mail to see that it said July 1st. I was getting quite anxious, since I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re just going to steal from us or not. Also, I was wondering how their validation process is going to be carried out. Is the basic idea that whoever has laid a claim on a wallet that has no additional claims will get the contents? Because when a friend of a friend of Jesus was filling out the form she basically just put down her wallet ID and nothing more. I heard from her that there was an option for putting down a btctalk username and some other things but can&#039;t remember everything she said. Could it be possible that, even if one is the only person that laid a claim, one may not receive the contents in the end due to lack of identifying info (even though the claim went through just fine)? I seriously doubt this paranoid thought but the foafoJ keeps bugging me about it. Thoughts/personal experiences on this whole process thus far?

				To be honest... I wouldn&#039;t hold your breath. So far the reacquisition of BTCs in other cases has not been successful. I mean if you don&#039;t have any identifying info what&#039;s stopping someone from providing some and claiming your wallet? He has ID, you don&#039;t. He gets BTCs. I imagine they&#039;re just going to keep delaying and delaying the payout date in hopes people will write off the BTCs as a loss. Hopefullly people realize what this is. A financial wakeup call. If you aren&#039;t the sole owner of your private key, you don&#039;t own anything.
