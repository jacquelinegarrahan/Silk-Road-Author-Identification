				hello so im something of a recluse looking to score some weed. iv got this far but all this talk of encryption, bitcoin laundering makes my head hurt.<br /><br />is pgp really necessary. all i want to do is get a small amount of weed so im not really concerned about the authorities. or is it necessary to safeguard the seller and the reliability of the transaction?<br /><br />and the laundering of bitcoins. i thought SR tumbled the coins before being deposited in your account so is this step necessary?

				If you&#039;ve gotten this far, PGP should be a breeze.&nbsp; There are a few threads about encryption near the top that will point you in the right direction.&nbsp; Once you have the PGP encryption on your machine, it&#039;s just a matter of importing the seller&#039;s public key, which amounts to copy and pasting into a text file and hitting import.&nbsp; Then hit clipboard, type your address and then hit encrypt, choose seller&#039;s key, copy the entire encrypted message into the text box for your address when you check out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read just about every thread on this forum and sellers have reported that it&#039;s very common to see plain text addresses, but why take a risk that&#039;s so easy to mitigate?<br /><br />If you buy bitcoins with cash, there&#039;s not much tumbling needed.&nbsp; Get-bitcoin.com makes it very easy and it&#039;s quick.&nbsp; Have the bitcoin sent to an online wallet, then to SR and you&#039;re good.&nbsp; If you are buying bitcoin from Mt. Gox with funds from your personal bank account or credit card, you might want to figure out how to mask your personal information.<br />

				It&#039;s not that hard, and I&#039;d be real wary of anyone trying to sell to you *without* bitcoins, as it&#039;s a scam.<br /><br />Everybody here has learned how to do it, to purchase bitcoins, regardless of what they are purchasing...and most of us have also learned how to use pgp.&nbsp; Seems a hassle, but once you &#039;get it&#039; it will be like light coming on...kind of cool, actually, and it&#039;s just for your protection, but usually u can buy without pgp, if you don&#039;t mind your address floating around out there...Everybody doesn&#039;t use them.<br /><br />Easiest way--that&#039;s safe--to get bitcoins is thru get-bitcoin.com, go to instawallet.org, and get you a&nbsp; url so you can have your bitcoins sent there, then send them to your bitcoin address on SR.<br /><br />If you do need to use pgp, go here: http://www.gpg4win.org/ download the app, then get your keys: they have good documentation...<br /><br />That&#039;s it....you have problems, just ask on here, somebody will help, but we expect you to do the studying, most of us were able to learn all this in a day or two...you get better with practice...
