				Hi there.<br /><br />Was looking at using Bit Innovate (https://bitinnovate.com) to source some bitcoins in Australia. Has anybody had any experience with them or recommend anyone else.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been using Spend Bitcoins but their fees and bitcoin rate are extremely high.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />

				Hey,<br />I would also like to know about this or any other trusted website to purchase bitcoins with AUD.<br />I used to go through crypto xchange but they shut down.<br /><br />Thanks.

				I used bitinnovate last week and got the bitcoins after about 45 minutes of depositing the cash in their Commonwealth Bank account.<br /><br />It was more expensive than sending through technocash to mtgox, but it was a hell of a lot more convenient. At the moment they have a special discount, only 7.4% commission for this Christmas. After that it goes back up to 9.9%.

				Thanks for the feedback.<br />Gave them a go today with no problems.<br />A little cheaper and easier than spendbitcoins.

				spendbitcoins has the option of other bank locations, not just commonwelth if that is an issue. <br /><br />Otherwise bitinnovate is where its at.

				Spendbitcoins may be a little more expensive, but Jeremy has reliably sold bitcoins to Aussies and deposited them into their accounts in only a matter of hours for a long time now. He has never let me down and I personally don&#039;t mind paying a little extra for the peace of mind I get from using Spendbitcoins. While I have and do get coins by other means on occasions, Jeremy&#039;s service is hard to beat IMO.&nbsp; :)

				^^ Definitely agree with you there Wadozo<br /><br />Having a choice of bank for your deposits also helps to prevent questions from curious tellers if they see you at their branch every week or whatever depositing random amounts to the same account..<br /><br />Even then you want to be selective... A few months back I went to a cba branch to deposit and when the guy checked the account name in the system, he recognised it and told me that he&#039;s heard of them... needless to say I haven&#039;t been back at that branch and spent the next few weeks somewhat paranoid lol

				Only problem I had with spendbitcoins is their high exchange rate and hefty fee. <br />Every transaction I had with them was successful and arrived when expected. Just looking for a cheaper alternative...

				Great hear about this, i thought i had &#039;spendbitcoins&#039; as my only option.<br />Will give Bitinnovate a try for sure. ;)<br /><br />I had a teller get suss one me last week. Couldnt believe i got the same person again. He got me to write my name down and a phone number. All fake of course, but the other 2 times he never said a thing. So i wont be going there again..<br /><br />Meh, whats up with bitinnovate? I&#039;ve entered what i want but it wont let me confirm order? WTF. ???<br />Nope doesnt work for me. Filled in the details and i cant even go to the next step, which is confirmation. Weird.<br />Back to spendbitcoins.... :(

				I&#039;ve always used spendbitcoins but used Bitinnovate yesterday as it was going to be a little cheaper with their Christmas special... Both companies got my bitcoins to my wallet in a matter of hours but think I&#039;ll mostly use spendbitcoins in the future so I can vary the banks I deposit at.

				Spendbitcoins is great. Fast as and handy having a selection of banks. It is pricey and i am getting over having to take out an extra 10-15 bucks just to make up for the fee and exchange.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s like years ago when i first moved to a new city i knew nobody so couldn&#039;t score my weed anywhere. So i went to bad side of town and hooked up with this slimy prick who thought he was entitled to a $10 buyers fee or a bud as he claimed he could only get the shit for me. Then I went to the dealer directly and was told that this slime bucket was just scamming me.<br /><br />Anyway will use the other services to try them out. <br /><br />I also am now getting paranoid info into banks. I am waiting for some smartarse young guy asking me &quot;ahh buying bitcoins eh..wonder what for..&quot;

				if you&#039;re buying from OS I personally don&#039;t see how we can complain about an extra 10% when we save a shit ton (depending on what product of course) overall..<br />
