				So I&#039;ve been waiting over a day for my funds to reach my SR account. Bitcoin-qt once gave me a pop up whether to include a transaction fee, but with this transaction gave me no such option (I now see an option in Settings to always include a fee).<br /><br />My client questions: How are the other BTC clients, and which do you use (Multibit, Armory, etc.)? Do they have quicker speeds at updating the blockchain, or a better interface to change the fees on the fly? (some transacts are time crucial, but some aren&#039;t; I&#039;m going to forget to change that setting every time in bitcoin-qt)&nbsp; <br /><br />Time frame questions: Whats the longest you&#039;ve had to wait on an unconfirmed transaction? At what point do I start thinking the software is frozen or screwy and backup, reinstall, and redownload the blockchain? I think the txlist on bitcoin charts had a list of 1500 unconfirmed transactions - normal, or not?

				Honestly, The easiest thing to do is to use Mt.Gox.<br />All I do is enter in the amount I want, go to the bank, hand over exact change, wait an hour (usually less)<br />Money is in my Mt.Gox account, buy bitcoins, transfer to Instawallet. Then Transfer to SR account.<br /><br />Someone else may know an easier way, but for me, this method takes 1-2 hours max (only because of waiting for the money to show up in your SR account).<br /><br />Side note, DO NOT ACCESS YOUR MT.GOX ACCOUNT VIA TOR. EVER.<br /><br />sdesu<br />

				Thanks for the suggestion. I&#039;ve always been wary of online wallets, but I gave them a shot (and a little through easywallet) and both seem legit, though I&#039;ll still keep the amount of BTC under 60.<br /><br />One question I forgot to ask. What happens if I send to transactions to the same SR account address? I know it changes each time; would one transaction be lost? Or do they always point to the same account, but displays only one to use?

				You should be able to tell from bitcoin-qt if your transaction is confirmed or not. Usually it takes well under an hour. The fee does not seem to make a difference. Ive tested with and without fee , so now I just send all my transactions with no fee. You should be running your bitcoin client through Tor though so your IP address is protected.
