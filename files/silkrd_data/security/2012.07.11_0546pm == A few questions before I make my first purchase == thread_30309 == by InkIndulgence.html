				Hello again,<br /><br />I have secured my coins, and am all ready to begin, I&#039;m going to start by ordering 5 books like the guide suggested, but I have a few questions I would like to clarification on if I could, just to make sure I don&#039;t make any stupid mistakes off the bat.<br /><br />1. The encrypting of my address/info, is this a requirement or a recommendation? Am I allowed to submit my address as is, or do I have to use the encryption/public key?<br /><br />2. I have several items I want to order. I am assuming it is not a good idea to order multiple things at the same time, so how long do you think is safe to wait after making one order before I should place another? How long do you all normally wait between orders?<br /><br />3. I plan on doing the &quot;Return to Sender&quot; writing on my packages, but I don&#039;t know whether I should open the package first, or leave unopened. If I open it, and god forbid something should happen, I would think they would say, &quot;Why didn&#039;t you call the police when you saw the contents?&quot; BUT if I don&#039;t open it, I can see them saying &quot;How do you know that you didn&#039;t order it, or it isn&#039;t for you if you don&#039;t even know what&#039;s inside?&quot;<br /><br />Thank you all, can&#039;t wait!

				You are being overly paranoid. And about the books, I haven&#039;t read the guide you are referring to but sellers can see how much you&#039;ve spent and how many transactions you&#039;ve done so it is pointless to buy digital books to boost buyers rating...

				Thank you for the help guys, with it I am confident with my first real usage of this place.<br /><br />And thanks for bringing me back down to the ground by telling me I&#039;m over worrying, I thought I might not be worried enough!<br /><br />Feel much better now.

				Dont bother with the books. Order smaller things to start with to gain confidence both for yourself and for vendors. <br />About the return to sender thing: Yeah, I thought I would do the same. However, I was so excited I ripped the package open and danced around the house when it arrived. Its highly unlikely the cops will bust your door down for buying a g.<br />*disclaimer, I base all my opinion on nothing.

				Don&#039;t bother buying the books for stats. When we look at your TX history and see that shit it just makes us avoid you like the plague. For me it&#039;s an instant &quot;Errrr fuck righhhht off&quot; pisses me off that people even try that shit.
