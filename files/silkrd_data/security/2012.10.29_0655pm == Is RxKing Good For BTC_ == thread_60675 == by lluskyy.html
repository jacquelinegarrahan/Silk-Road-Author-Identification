				As you all know BitInstant is currently acting up, making purchasing BTC a rough task. With that said, anyone have any experience with this vendor as far as WU to BTC?

				Why make this post when you can click on the listing and read the 50+ feedback&#039;s left by SR members? <br /><br />You know...the people that actually used the service. That is the reason feedback is left..so that&nbsp; you can read it and see what others have said.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Haha I was just messaging him about this very service. He certainly looks legit, and with Bitinstant&#039;s change of policy I need an alternative. I was tired of paying their fees anyway. I&#039;m going to give him a shot.

				He isn&#039;t a good Btc Vendor... He&#039;s a great vendor! He is extremely fast in responding to messages and is very professional. I was actually planning on buying Btc from him last Friday but my associates backed out of the deal at the last minute so now I have to wait for them or find another partner for my purchase.

				Yep, definitely doing business with him again if he allows me to. I should&#039;ve read his instructions twice, maybe three times, but the BTC went to my account not even an hour after I got back to him.

Just because you made this post! Though as I told you in a message I would have anyways ;). Just like that you came into the forums and admitted you totally screwed up and in fact went awol and didn&#039;t respond to messages AFTER you sent me the money. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t believe you made this thread when you can just read my feedback..but more shocking was you did a deal with me...didn&#039;t do it right..sent me the money but then vanished. Just stopped contacting me AFTER you sent money and before I sent you coin. I of course did what I said I would, but I was shocked that you did this let alone did not follow my simple instructions. I don&#039;t mind of course as I don&#039;t really need to &quot;talk&quot; to you once money is sent..I just put btc in your account, but you would think you would be right on top of it and make sure I indeed put the coin in. Instead you just vanished.<br /><br />What I find strange is I have been here 6 months and have perfect feedback, I help a lot of people and none post in the forums. And I am fine with that as all of them leave nice feedback. But people wont read the feedback instead they will come to the forums and ask. But no one in the forums has done business with me. <br /><br />Anyways you make this thread and at the same time are talking to me on SR. You go ahead and send me money and you don&#039;t follow my simple rules. No biggie. But then I can&#039;t get a hold of you. I have your $$ and you do not have the btc... I just go ahead and send you YOUR btc and still I don&#039;t hear from you for 8 hours. When you do contact me you say sorry and hope I don&#039;t ban you and say in the future you will&nbsp; follow my rules and actually read the listing.<br /><br />This brings up a great point. I can&#039;t tell you how many people are worried about this service...as getting btc on SR is not the easiest thing to do. And my way happens to be the easiest and fastest. What is strange is they do not even read what to do! They do all this detective work before they place an&nbsp; order...then they just don&#039;t follow the rules..So strange.<br /><br /><br />Anyways...if you read my listing and follow the SIMPLE rules I lay out..and I cover every single thing...you will have BTC in under 1 hour with no fees what so ever. I have over 100 transactions for over 5 months and glowing feedback...yet people will not read my listing. Strange.<br /><br />So I say to you. Thanks for making this post and for manning up that you fucked up yet you still got your btc in under 1 hour and everything was good. I will of course deal with you again. I just ask you follow the rules next time&nbsp; :D. And I thank you for your business as there are many great choices if you look around..blueskytraders and sugar mama to name a couple(there are others..those two just stick out to me) that you could use and you chose me. And I thank you for that.<br /><br /><br />I am online 12pm PST to 8pm PST to answer questions that are not answered in my listing or on my vendor page. I just ask that you read both before you send me any message as I am busy and don&#039;t have time for stupid questions that are already answered multiple times on my page and in my listings. But I do understand it is a lot of money to a lot of people and it is strange just to send someone money, even if their ratings are good, there is always a first and in a way fuck the ratings...those don&#039;t help you when a vendor go&#039;s awol and you are the one they do it too!! I just do not like answering questions that are clearly answered on my page. As I am busy taking care of customers.<br /><br />If you read my feedback..the only KING around me..is my customers. So thanks to all of them. You made me the KING!

I understand one can&#039;t be bothered 50 times a day to pick up a whopping 40 bucks or what not, but maybe it&#039;s worth your while for slightly smaller transactions? Just wondering, thanks.

				Sorry I do/will not do anything less then $500.00. You said it right...not worth my time and I would be bothered 50 times a day.<br /><br />Blueskytraders and sugar mama are 2 that you should try. There are of course others. Just check the feedback before doing any business and go with a vendor that has been here for a while and has a good track record.<br /><br />I know btc seems hard to get/understand. It really is not. There are plenty of ways to purchase it. Just don&#039;t buy from anyone that takes a debit/credit card.<br /><br />

				RxKing is the real deal.awesome guy. I messaged him this morning and he replied right away even though it said to msg him at 12pst he happened to be around and even waited for me to take care of business at WU, that my friend is great customer service. The transaction was as smooth as a babys ass. If you can follow directions then your transaction will be just as smooth, it is not rocket science. Simple instructions. The btc was in my account lightning fast. Will definitely go to RXking again.
