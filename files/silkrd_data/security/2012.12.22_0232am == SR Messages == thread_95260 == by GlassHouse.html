				When a vendor deletes a message, does it delete the message on the Buyer&#039;s end as well?&nbsp; <br /><br />Doubting that this is reality, but would like to encourage people to delete messages often.&nbsp; We have a lot of Buyers who don&#039;t use PGP and want updates.&nbsp; Happy to oblige, but just wonder how we can get the information deleted after that.&nbsp; Are we completely reliant upon the Buyer to delete their messages.&nbsp;

				Would be nice if all messages between 2 users were automatically deleted 14 (or 30 or whatever) days after the last message between them, on the assumption that the conversation is over. That used to happen with the account transaction history after (I&#039;ve read) 20 days, but it doesn&#039;t appear to be the case anymore, which is strange. I have items in my account history going back almost 2 months. I suppose I could push them off the end of the list by doing a bunch of deposits and withdrawals, but there&#039;s no guarantee they are actually deleted.

				It would be nice.&nbsp; Maybe a feature could be added where transaction history and messages are deleted after 5 days of being read, unless they are flagged to save.&nbsp; Do you think it is possible for SR to do?

				why would u ever care? if someone gets into ur SR account ur clearly buying drugs.. <br /><br />wtf difference does it make that they now can see what u and the drug dealer talked about? <br /><br />if LE gets into ur SR account then they either got u to tell on urself and said u got drugs off SR then gave them ur account info<br /><br />or ur mom or dad got on and saw it was popped up.. either way ur a jackass and u should GTFO of SR..<br /><br />i would personally be pissed if they deleted my messages without telling me if i want to save a special conversation due to maybe some terms or something that a vender agreed to <br />or maybe because it had a helpful hint or perhaps special info of any kind and it was deleted i would be outraged.. <br /><br />therefor YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID!!<br />

				I&#039;m a vendor, so I care, because sometimes people ask for shipping udpates and info and I don&#039;t want that shit linked back to my vendor account directly if possible.

				Also note that the suggestion said that you could flag message you wanted saved.<br /><br />So, in all reality, your argument is invalid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy Holidays :)

				What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I&#039;ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I&#039;ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I&#039;m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You&#039;re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that&#039;s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn&#039;t, you didn&#039;t, and now you&#039;re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You&#039;re fucking dead, kiddo.

This is for technical reasons. This is why you must insist your buyers use pgp. If the servers should ever be compromised, all of those clear text messages will be exposed to the intruder.<br /><br />I will not answer any questions that involve price, shipping info, shipping times or methods, basically anything that is even remotely sensitive, without encryption.&nbsp; There was a thread going here a few months ago from a fellow who had attended (or knew someone who had attended...? not sure) an LE conference. One of the topics that came up was the fact that LE is fucked by encryption. They can&#039;t crack it. Even if you email host/ISP/whoever hands over data, if it is encrypted it is useless to LE. You can absolutely put your money on the idea that if LE ever gets their hands on these servers, the only people who are going to be popped are the ones who don&#039;t use encryption.

While I realize that any such mandatory policies offend their agorist sensibilities, it is nonetheless a truism in the real world that voluntary policies tend not to be followed. The fact that numerous vendors have stated flat-out that 80-90% of the address information they receive is unencrypted&nbsp; underscore this point.&nbsp; Sometimes people _have_ to be forced to do the right thing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95260.msg677078#msg677078">Quote from: brutusk on December 22, 2012, 09:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To be clear, the shipping info in an order is deleted right away.

My thoughts keep drifting back to the operators of The Farmers&#039; Market, and also of those caught up in the DEA&#039;s Operation Raw Deal (ORD) before that. All of these relied on Hushmail for their security, and that is one of the primary reasons that many of them are sitting in prison right now. Both vendors and buyers alike have to learn enough background to be able to distinguish the snake oil (Hushmail, PortablePGP, iGolder.com, etc.) from the genuine articles. In particular, the operators of The Farmers&#039; Market were told by people who knew them in real life, that their security was shit -- they just chose not to listen. I find myself wondering if they now regret not having taken the advice they were given. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95260.msg677078#msg677078">Quote from: brutusk on December 22, 2012, 09:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I absolutely insist on pgp.

That said, I would go further -- I would insist, as a pre-condition for obtaining an account (whether buyer or seller), that a prospective buyer or vendor: <br /><br />1) Post a PGP key for use with the account; and <br /><br />2) Demonstrate their proficiency with PGP by correctly answering an encrypted challenge. <br /><br />These would have two effects: first it would compel people to use PGP; and second, it would have the side-effect of virtually eliminating account spoofing/theft. (Provided the server is uncompromised, of course.) <br /><br />NC<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If the servers should ever be compromised, all of those clear text messages will be exposed to the intruder.<br /><br />I will not answer any questions that involve price, shipping info, shipping times or methods, basically anything that is even remotely sensitive, without encryption.&nbsp; There was a thread going here a few months ago from a fellow who had attended (or knew someone who had attended...? not sure) an LE conference. One of the topics that came up was the fact that LE is fucked by encryption. They can&#039;t crack it. Even if you email host/ISP/whoever hands over data, if it is encrypted it is useless to LE. You can absolutely put your money on the idea that if LE ever gets their hands on these servers, the only people who are going to be popped are the ones who don&#039;t use encryption. I can&#039;t believe how many people have sent me names/addresses/etc unencrypted.<br /><br />To be clear, the shipping info in an order is deleted right away. However, if the servers are compromised, all of those unfilled orders with clear text addresses are going right into LE files. Those are the people who will be raided.<br /><br />I value my freedom. Every time I am tempted to take any kind of shortcut in this business, I stop and ask myself, &quot;If I go to prison, will I kick myself for not doing xxx?&quot; The answer is usually YES. <br /><br />I absolutely insist on pgp. I suggest all vendors do the same, it isn&#039;t hard to use and creates a phenomenal layer of security and frustration between you and LE.
