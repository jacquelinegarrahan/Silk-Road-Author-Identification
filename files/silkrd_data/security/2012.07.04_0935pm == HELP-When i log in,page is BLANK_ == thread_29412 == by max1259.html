				I haven&#039;t been logged in for a couple of Months but last week i decided to deposit a load of bitcoins,I tried one laptop but when i logged in it was just a blank screen,it still said silk road anonymous market at the top but nothing else,just a blank screen?<br /><br />I kept trying but no joy,it didn&#039;t say password failed just blank,I used my other account and it was fine,what&#039;s up?<br />The thing is I found an android phone that logged me in,it had been plugged in and logged in for weeks so i deposited about 40 coins,checked and they had landed,logged out and now that phone just keeps giving me a blank screen.<br />The weird thing is when i log in with my other account everything is fine,what the hell is going on? Anyone have a clue? Anyone had similar issues? Im gutted here.<br />What the hell is going on guys? <br />Please help<br /><br />My main account has similar name an i can prove when i deposited,please help SR or anyone,cant afford to lose 300 quid.

				Yeah man,i always type that in exactly and never use links...The weird thing is it&#039;s&nbsp; accepting my password etc and even going to the next screen where it says &#039;Silkroad Anonymous Market&#039; at the top.<br /><br />It&#039;s&nbsp; just the rest of the screen is completely blank and i&nbsp; cant do anything,yet if i logg in with my account with no bitcoins in then straight away it works like it should.<br />Ive used four different devices all with the same result,im well fucked off seeing as I&#039;ve&nbsp; just deposited about 40 coins which i cant afford to lose&nbsp; :( <br />The only reason i could access to deposit was thru an android phone that had been left plugged in for weeks without logging out,as soon as i deposited and logged off,can&#039;t&nbsp; access my account on that as well.<br />I feel like SR has took my coins and run but their trying to help,telling me to log in with a different tor identity but av no idea what they mean?<br />Any help? Any ideas? Hs this happened to anyone else or am i being bugged and just fucked.<br />Deperate
