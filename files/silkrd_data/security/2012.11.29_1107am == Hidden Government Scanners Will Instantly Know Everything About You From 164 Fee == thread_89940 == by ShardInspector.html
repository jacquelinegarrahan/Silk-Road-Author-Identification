				Very concerning...<br /><br />Here is the link to the article I have pasted in below:<br />http://gizmodo.com/5923980/the-secret-government-laser-that-instantly-knows-everything-about-you<br /><br /><br />Hidden Government Scanners Will Instantly Know Everything About You From 164 Feet Away<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Within the next year or two, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will instantly know everything about your body, clothes, and luggage with a new laser-based molecular scanner fired from 164 feet (50 meters) away. From traces of drugs or gun powder on your clothes to what you had for breakfast to the adrenaline level in your body—agents will be able to get any information they want without even touching you.<br /><br />And without you knowing it.<br /><br />The technology is so incredibly effective that, in November 2011, its inventors were subcontracted by In-Q-Tel to work with the US Department of Homeland Security. In-Q-Tel is a company founded &quot;in February 1999 by a group of private citizens at the request of the Director of the CIA and with the support of the U.S. Congress.&quot; According to In-Q-Tel, they are the bridge between the Agency and new technology companies.<br /><br />Their plan is to install this molecular-level scanning in airports and border crossings all across the United States. The official, stated goal of this arrangement is to be able to quickly identify explosives, dangerous chemicals, or bioweapons at a distance.<br /><br />The machine is ten million times faster—and one million times more sensitive—than any currently available system. That means that it can be used systematically on everyone passing through airport security, not just suspect or randomly sampled people.<br />Analyzing everything in real time<br /><br />But the machine can sniff out a lot more than just explosives, chemicals and bioweapons. The company that invented it, Genia Photonics, says that its laser scanner technology is able to &quot;penetrate clothing and many other organic materials and offers spectroscopic information, especially for materials that impact safety such as explosives and pharmacological substances.&quot; [PDF]<br /><br />Formed in Montreal in 2009 by PhDs with specialties in lasers and fiber optics, Genia Photonics has 30 patents on this technology, claiming incredible biomedical and industrial applications—from identifying individual cancer cells in a real-time scan of a patient, to detecting trace amounts of harmful chemicals in sensitive manufacturing processes.<br /><br />Hidden Government Scanners Will Instantly Know Everything About You From 164 Feet AwayAbove: The Genia Photonics&#039; Picosecond Programmable Laser scanner is capable of detecting every tiny trace of any substance on your body, from specks of gunpowder to your adrenaline levels to a sugar-sized grain of cannabis to what you had for breakfast.<br /><br />Meanwhile, In-Q-Tel states that &quot;an important benefit of Genia Photonics&#039; implementation as compared to existing solutions is that the entire synchronized laser system is comprised in a single, robust and alignment-free unit that may be easily transported for use in many environments… This compact and robust laser has the ability to rapidly sweep wavelengths in any pattern and sequence.&quot; [PDF]<br /><br />So not only can they scan everyone. They would be able to do it everywhere: the subway, a traffic light, sports events... everywhere.<br />How does it work?<br /><br />The machine is a mobile, rack-mountable system. It fires a laser to provide molecular-level feedback at distances of up to 50 meters in just picoseconds. For all intents and purposes, that means instantly.<br /><br />The small, inconspicuous machine is attached to a computer running a program that will show the information in real time, from trace amounts of cocaine on your dollar bills to gunpowder residue on your shoes. Forget trying to sneak a bottle of water past security—they will be able to tell what you had for breakfast in an instant while you&#039;re walking down the hallway.<br /><br />The technology is not new, it&#039;s just millions times faster and more convenient than ever before. Back in 2008, a team at George Washington University developed a similar laser spectrometer using a different process. It could sense drug metabolites in urine in less than a second, trace amounts of explosive residue on a dollar bill, and even certain chemical changes happening in a plant leaf.<br /><br />And the Russians also have a similar technology: announced last April, their &quot;laser sensor can pick up on a single molecule in a million from up to 50 meters away.&quot;<br /><br />So if Genia Photonics&#039; claims pan out, this will be an incredible leap forward in terms of speed, portability, and convenience. One with staggering implications.<br />Observation without limits<br /><br />There has so far been no discussion about the personal rights and privacy issues involved. Which &quot;molecular tags&quot; will they be scanning for? Who determines them? What are the threshold levels of this scanning? If you unknowingly stepped on the butt of someone&#039;s joint and are carrying a sugar-sized grain of cannabis like that unfortunate traveler currently in jail in Dubai, will you be arrested?<br /><br />And, since it&#039;s extremely portable, will this technology extend beyone the airport or border crossings and into police cars, with officers looking for people on the street with increased levels of adrenaline in their system to detain in order to prevent potential violent outbursts? And will your car be scanned at stoplights for any trace amounts of suspicious substances? Would all this information be recorded anywhere?<br /><br />Hidden Government Scanners Will Instantly Know Everything About You From 164 Feet AwayAbove: A page from a Genia Photonics paper describing its ability to even penetrate through clothing.<br /><br />There are a lot of questions with no answer yet, but it&#039;s obvious that the potential level of personal invasion of this technology goes far beyond that of body scans, wiretaps, and GPS tracking.<br />The end of privacy coming soon<br /><br />According to the undersecretary for science and technology of the Department of Homeland Security, this scanning technology will be ready within one to two years, which means you might start seeing them in airports as soon as 2013.<br /><br />In other words, these portable, incredibly precise molecular-level scanning devices will be cascading lasers across your body as you walk from the bathroom to the soda machine at the airport and instantly reporting and storing a detailed breakdown of your person, in search of certain &quot;molecular tags&quot;.<br /><br />Going well beyond eavesdropping, it seems quite possible that U.S. government plans on recording molecular data on travelers without their consent, or even knowledge that it&#039;s possible—a scary thought. While the medical uses could revolutionize the way doctors diagnose illness, and any technology that could replace an aggressive pat-down is tempting, there&#039;s a potential dark side to this implementation, and we need to shine some light on it before it&#039;s implemented.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The author of this story is currently completing his PhD in renewable energy solutions, focusing on converting waste to energy in the urban environment. Even while most of this information is publicly available, he wanted to remain anonymous.

				tl;dr<br /><br />I like to keep optimistic, It&#039;s hard with this kind of shit going on. One thing about this technology, the internet, and anonymous is that we finally have an effective way to fight back and be heard. It won&#039;t fix these problems and nothing ever will but we can keep catching up. One of the most important things to accomplish, in my opinion, is government transparency. Then, for the first time we&#039;ll be one step ahead of the corrupt leaders.

				Anon, the problem is that the people ARE the government.<br /><br />99% of the morons in the world will never read that article, but if they did they would view it as a good thing.<br /><br />Anon may be legion, and God speed to them, but they aint as legion as the people. They aint as legion as morons, and the people will remain docile, fat lazy and stupid with their hands tied to the corporate oar rowing and rowing for their daily bread. They will keep on pumping out new workers and keep their children&#039;s eyes closed and the system will continue.<br /><br />It is my belief that we 1% must continue to rebel and educate the few we can affect, but mostly use information like this article to protect our selves.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don&#039;t fly.<br /><br />Modzi

				This is some crazy technology, but I would think it would be subject to search and seizure laws. In other words, there may have to be some kind of consent (except airports, border crossings, and government buildings).<br /><br />But to put something like this on the street to scan people in cars. or those walking down the street? I would think a good lawyer can get a judge to strike that down as an unreasonable search. At least in the states.<br /><br />As far as this being put into cop cars, a precious ruling already said its perfectly legal for a drug dog to sniff your car without your consent, as long as it takes place in a legitamite traffic stop. So, you have to be doing something that causes the cop to pull you over, before he can use a drug (or potentially this tech) to scan your car.<br /><br />The automatic driving car can&#039;t come soon enough...<br /><br />Hopefully, we can fight from this tech being used in obscenely intrusive ways to scan us at all times.<br /><br />I just hope the post office never gets these...

				Mylar clothing, head to feet.<br /><br />But seriously, all of this was completely predictable and to be expected, the more highly advanced technology becomes. I mean, with computers and all the rest of the technology armory, there&#039;s only one way for people, and especially those in power, to behave: and that is, doing things to predict (no surprises), dominate (brainwash to the point of catalepsy) and control (you will do as you&#039;re told or else). That&#039;s the nature of human beings. Those with good moral principles and ideology, when given a chance to be in power, transform into bloodsucking freaks who want nothing more than to remain in power. It is the world&#039;s most addictve and pervasive drug.<br /><br />I see no way out short of complete and catastrophic implosion of the system.

				Yes, this is scary. Yes, it&#039;s looking like if the predictions made about this technology is true, things could get a lot harder very fast for people wanting to use illegal drugs or save some shred of privacy.<br /><br />But it&#039;s not over yet. This is just the latest in a long line of advances that have made it easier for the government to strip away our privacy, and for the most part, we&#039;ve met them at each step, upping the level of our game to match theirs. This newest enemy is formidable, to be sure, but we haven&#039;t had our say yet. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m no expert on the technology mentioned in this article, so I can&#039;t make any judgments yet, but there are almost always ways to circumvent things like this. Tentatively, I offer the idea of storing drugs by changing them, with a reversible chemical reaction, to a molecule that won&#039;t be flagged by these scanners, and then when it&#039;s time to use them, reversing it and going on with your merry way. I have no idea if that will actually work in practice, but it&#039;s an idea. Obviously work-arounds like this are going to take some time, expertise, and effort to develop and begin to deploy, but I have little doubt that it will happen. <br />It always has in the past.

				No, the idiots seeking funding for this fools errand are claiming this nonsense will be able to scan you for everything but in reality it will be nothing but false positives and unreliability. They are trying to sell it&#039;s potential to morons in your government, who will hand them money and get back a bunch of garbage that doesn&#039;t work and will end up scrapped. <br /><br />There&#039;s plenty of non vaporware things to be scared of, like smart water, the coming war against free computing when we&#039;re all mandated to use corporate approved appliances instead of free systems, exponential police powers increasing every year and deteriorating rights to privacy. This pipe dream technology is a joke compared to what&#039;s actually happening right now.

				When has the failing economy stopped the government from spending an outrageous amount of money on something that would give it more control on it&#039;s populous? <br />This will be especially bad for all of us if they implement it in the postal system.

				I don&#039;t believe them.&nbsp; This is an insane claim.&nbsp; This claim is equivalent to saying that they&#039;ve developed anti-gravity technology, or that they&#039;ve developed a process whereby your entire kitchen magically cleans itself every night at 2:43am while you sleep.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.<br /><br />50 meters is insane for this technology.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how this is even remotely possible: from 50 fucking meters, you&#039;re telling me this tiny little device is able to read the energy returned to it by this little laser -- there and back, which is 100 meters total -- with perfect accuracy, and then feed this data to a connected computing device so that the computer can analyze it and thereby determine what molecules are present?&nbsp; MAYBE.&nbsp; But actually successfully analyze the data?&nbsp; That&#039;s fucking preposterous.<br /><br />Let&#039;s talk about what happens to a beam of energy that travels 100 meters.&nbsp; It travels through air.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of fucking stuff in the air around us.&nbsp; Like, a fucking lot.&nbsp; And in order to detect a speck of an illegal substance in a person&#039;s pocket, for instance, this device would have to emit an energy beam at some wavelength that passes through the clothing but that also is reflected at least partially -- possible?&nbsp; Check, we can do that today; that&#039;s trivial.<br /><br />However, it also has to detect the &quot;fingerprint&quot; of energy returned to the device from the initial emitted beam -- is this part possible?&nbsp; Sure, that&#039;s trivial too, BUT... detecting it with any level of accuracy?&nbsp; That&#039;s hard.&nbsp; That&#039;s very, very hard.&nbsp; There&#039;s a ton of stuff in 100 meters of air.&nbsp; That&#039;s going to cause significant refraction.<br /><br />Now stay with me here, this is the part that REALLY makes me say they&#039;re full of shit: the refraction is what they&#039;re fucking measuring.&nbsp; The amount of distortion is what they&#039;re looking at.&nbsp; That&#039;s how mass spectrometry works, basically -- it measures the amount of distortion present.&nbsp; What they&#039;re claiming to measure is the amount of distortion present in a beam of energy that&#039;s returned to the device after traveling 100 meters.<br /><br />Okay, sure... maybe on paper it&#039;s theoretically possible for their detector to be so sensitive that it can detect the differences that will be present depending on what molecules it&#039;s bounced off of.&nbsp; Notice that they&#039;re calling this a &quot;programmable&quot; device.&nbsp; Notice that they mention hooking it up to a computer to feed it data.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I think: somebody made a fucking stellar pitch to some government office who had too much money left in their budget.&nbsp; Now this is how the US government works (unfortunately): if you don&#039;t spend your entire budget, it gets decreased, because -- well -- you didn&#039;t fucking spend it and we&#039;re short of money, so apparently you don&#039;t need it.&nbsp; This has caused a massive industry to build up around government contracts, because none of them want their fucking budget decreased so they end up buying the best of a bunch of useless shit knowing they&#039;ll never use it (or that it&#039;s worthless even).<br /><br />So this department had extra money, and somebody said they had a device that was sensitive enough to do this.&nbsp; They failed to point out clearly that their device will not allow you to do what they claim.&nbsp; It will allow you to figure out how to do what they claim.&nbsp; Their device will feed data to a computer, which will be totally 100% fucking useless because nobody on Earth knows how to analyze the fucking rubbish data their super-sensitive device feeds them.<br /><br />But the department their contract is with will keep its budget.&nbsp; Reporters go insane because the company obviously talks it up in press reports.&nbsp; And voila, you have a totally useless, but &quot;almost&quot; working device (in the same way that I&#039;m &quot;almost&quot; a newborn).<br /><br />By the way: existing mass spectrometry devices vaporize and ionize the material they analyze.&nbsp; So they&#039;ve also apparently figured out a way to get around having to vaporize everyone their beam scans.<br /><br />/end_rant

				It may be very easy using this to monitor the mail like never before and they might take the opportunity to do a mass bust before word gets out it&#039;s being done.&nbsp; If they could use these to check every piece of mail going out it&#039;s possible there could be a national bust day where 10,000 or more people are busted worldwide and then we find out they are using this

				I read all the articles on it and two other companies invented the technology at the same time as the one the U.S. gov is buying theirs from.&nbsp; Two of the companies are in the U.S. and the other one is Russian.

				These scanners are for real and our government is already buying them.&nbsp; Fact.&nbsp; A girl at school has a smart pen with a camera on the end that records everything she hand writes and turns it into html at home.&nbsp; Also it has an audio recorder to record the teacher.&nbsp; These days it&#039;s weirder to not believe something happen eventually than not, but pico-second programmable laser is real now.

				Besides the security and privacy implications for the general population, this is real good news for science and industry. This device will have many applications that you can make big money from. Think chemical/bilogical + mineral identification just for starters. Treasure hunting or prospecting for precious metals/gems/minerals from space or an UAV. Identifying&nbsp; diseases in people and animals from a distance. Identifying bacteria/viruses on surfaces from a long distance.<br /><br />You can easily disable those devices along with traffic/bank/other cameras by pointing a high power blue laser into the receving &quot;eye&quot; of the unit. It will burn the circuit instantly disabling the device permanently until replaced (expensive + time consuming).<br /><br />

				There is hardly any moneybill to find that doesn&#039;t have some traces of cocain. Stores and companys like supermarkets contaminate money.

				I&#039;m not sure I buy all of this. This could be a carefully crafted psy-op. When you&#039;re dealing with the intelligence community, literally anything is possible. You must remember that the banking and intelligence industry would collapse overnight if it weren&#039;t for the huge amounts of black market cash infused into the financial system by drug transactions. This cash is essential for financial institutions to make their fractional reserve banking system possible. If the system does do what is described then there&#039;s no way they would simply turn it loose and try to actually catch all the drugs in the world. It would more likely be used on a selective enforcement basis, to root out up and coming big players, or those who are not following the financial industry&#039;s marching orders. You must remember that the Taliban had almost entirely stamped out the Afghan heroin trade. After the invasion, Afghanistan is back on top as the number 1 heroin producing region in the world. A case can be made that the real reason for creating the 911 false flag psy-op was to reestablish Afghan heroin production. The world&#039;s financial institutions need that massive outflux of highly addictive substance to get governments to fund their police and prison industrial complex. The massive level of addiction also helps to implement their &quot;political control through global poverty&quot; model.
