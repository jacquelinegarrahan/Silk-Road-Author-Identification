				I was just remembering something that happened to me many many years ago.<br /><br />I had hidden this small baggy of marijuana in the pocket of a shirt.<br /><br />One day I had to travel to another state so I caught a domestic flight.&nbsp; This was in South America where security isn&#039;t as tight as it is in the US and A.<br /><br />I had completely forgotten about this tiny baggy of marijuana and packed this shirt in my luggage.<br /><br />I arrived at my destination and went straight to the hotel.<br /><br />When I was unpacking I saw this baggy and froze.&nbsp; <br /><br />It had passed x-rays and wasn&#039;t detected.<br /><br />But I had run a huge risk of getting caught.<br /><br />So always remember not to forget that hidden stash.<br /><br />You could get in trouble for nothing!!!!!!<br /><br />Imagine the TSA finding drugs in your luggage that you are not aware of.<br /><br />What are you going to say?<br />Someone put it there?<br />It&#039;s a prank?<br /><br />Will you get in trouble nonetheless?<br /><br />&nbsp;:D <br /><br />

				Hah, I had something similar.&nbsp; Where I stash my stuff isn&#039;t something you can easily see if you were rummaging through my gear, thought I FOR SURE had it out... arrive at my destination, open up my bag and there was green.<br /><br />I have to say, that was a trip I needed a little green, but I probably won&#039;t be forgetting it&#039;s in there again.&nbsp; I think with small amounts, you do have a little deniability, or hopefully the agent isn&#039;t a total douche and will just let you discard it.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve got a medical card, I know that gets you some TINY amount of leverage and more likely to not deal with it.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have enough that you&#039;re going to be distributing, they&#039;re more concerned with actual dangers and sniffing out bombs / knives / fingernails clippers / checking out little old ladies through the xray scanner.

				I had forgotten one time that I had half a dub of white in my wallet. Went to Mexico city for a couple weeks, came back and while looking for a card or something in the airport found it hidden flat in one of the pockets. About shat bricks! ;D
