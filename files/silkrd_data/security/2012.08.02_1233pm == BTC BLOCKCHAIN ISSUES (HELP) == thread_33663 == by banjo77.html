				go to blockchain.info and paste the sr address you sent to in the box in the lower right of the page, it will show you how far the transaction has progresses. If nothing shows up for the transaction that means mt gox hasn&#039;t sent it, it has happened before, they are masters of spewing bullshit when they fuck up.

				I&#039;m having a similar issue, been about 4 hours. When I go to blockchain.info it definitely shows up as sent. Yet, I haven&#039;t received it yet. It shows the amount of BTC I sent as &quot;total received&quot; but shows as 0 in the balance.

				Another case here.<br />Over 6 hours ago, I bought 20 btc, but that went through(in 2 minutes too), but it has&nbsp; had 43 confirmations since then .<br />Now the transaction from there to my SR address has 38 confirmations, and its red with -20btc, unlike the green status of what i recieved.<br />i dont even understand what this confirmation shit is, I just use the damn BTC system to buy shit.<br />What are the possible outcomes? cos that was all my spare money for a week.<br />EDIT:<br />i forgot, they even asked for a 0.001 fee because my transaction was low priority, if I didnt pay it, I could <br />be waiting up to 24 hours??? go figure.

				I paid the transfer and still haven&#039;t got anything. Im new to this and very excited to the point that fees aren&#039;t really a big deal to me(more than willing to support the efforts). But I am now fustrated that I have willingly been supportive of the btc movement without seeing any benefit for myself. I sure hope this doesn&#039;t crush my first impression and the high hopes.&nbsp; :o Please pull through Silk road or Block chain. Whoever can help in this situation.

				I didnt mind paying the transfer either, and looking again, it was .005, its fuckall, <br />so i didnt care, if it helped speed it through, seems we&#039;ve been taken for a ride.<br />I dont recall this fee thing before, man I hope Im wrong though.<br />
