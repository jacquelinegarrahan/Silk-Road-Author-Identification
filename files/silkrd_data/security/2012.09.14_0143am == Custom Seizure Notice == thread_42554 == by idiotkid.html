				Hi, Guys.<br /><br />So I got a Custom&#039;s Notice Seizure letter today. I had a stroke of good luck however, because what I ordered was a handful of pills and some meth. But the seizure notice was for one tablet.. Thank God. So it wasn&#039;t a narcotic seizure and they&#039;ll just destroy it. Though I&#039;m a bit annoyed with the vendor for sending me something completely different to what I wanted and costs way less. But that&#039;s another story. I should just count my lucky stars.<br /><br />My question is: Is my address now burned? Will they be watching any incoming mail, internationally or/and domestically? I am not going to order internationally, so, don&#039;t worry, but I just want to ask. And if it&#039;s not safe, how long does it stay that way? Is domestic ok still?<br /><br />I assume because something got flagged, even though it;s not narcotic, they will keep my address is a database, and any further forfeitures could be used to make a case against me. Or am I over-estimating the Government.<br /><br />So, after I guess, 5/10 packaged made it from overseas, including this siezed one, making my strike rate 50%. But I think, 3 of those that didn&#039;t arrive were scammers. So, 5/7. Not bad.<br /><br />Any advice/information for me and the community would be great.<br />

				As I understand it, your address will be basically under watch now mail wise but it&#039;s not like they can open every single piece of mail you receive. Your best defense is to buy only from vendors who have THE BEST packaging. Also, as a precaution, when receiving any shipment 1) don&#039;t sign for it. 2) immediately write return to sender on it and let it sit by your door inside your place for a day or two. That way if the cops come knocking you can put into question whether or not you actually ordered that shipment. <br /><br />However I am not in the AU so I dunno that much about how your customs/DEA works, so anyone out there can feel free to correct/add on to my advice. <br /><br />Stay safe!

				as far as prescriptions stuff goes, unless the amount seized was a &#039;commercial quantity&#039; (varies based on the type of pill; schedule 8 drugs, like dex,ritalin,opis,barbs etc, its a fair bit lower, but schedule 4 stuff, like benzos, anything a GP prescribes that doesnt require an &#039;authority&#039; script, basically; it takes a lot to be considered &#039;commercial&#039; ), but its really nothing to worry about. i&#039;ve only ever gone o/s for pills, and most get through, though ive had about 8 or 9 seizure notices over about 24 months or so. some for up to 1000 schedule 4&#039;s, schedule 8&#039;s the highest was 50. all were to the same place, same name. etc. ive never had any &#039;knocks at the door&#039;, or anything at all beyond the standard seizure letter, which i just ignore, and let them chuck out the pills. <br />given that this is public, going into more detail here, especially re: illicit shit, probably wouldnt be wise. but there are a few pretty simple things you can do that&#039;ll make it very difficult for you to find yourself in trouble.

				I&#039;ve gotten a Customs Seizure notice and still received other international mail no problem, unless you had a shitload of product confiscated, you really don&#039;t need to worry that much. Sure, a little paranoia can be good at times to keep you on your toes but from all the people I know that get sent illegal goods from overseas...not a single one has ever had a problem after getting things confiscated (at least regarding USA people).

				well i will say i had a good friend get a package from usa 220g. of med. grade weed. she got away with it but barley. then customs said if she had another one that they will charge her with the first one. now i know just because you are charged does not mean you are gulity but no fun going to court. but is in Sweden. i think AU is strict also.
