				First tried to use Bitinstant through CVS which was my primary means of funding, but their system is doing weird checks with names and phone numbers lately and make me super paranoid.&nbsp; So I tried to change over a moneypak through namedeclined.&nbsp; <br /><br />Learned my lesson...<br /><br />Says he sent the BTC within a couple hours of the order, see the response below....<br /><br />&quot;Thank you for the order. I just sent you the BTC. The reason the ad is no longer up is because when vendors post ads on SR they have to choose how many times it can be bought or inventory on hand. I usually set it at 3 - 5 depending on how many BTC I have, this way when I am away for a few hours before I check back I do not get 10 orders for BTC when i can only fill around 3 or so and that way I do not have to cancel orders and waste the time of buyers or upset them that way. You actually got lucky and bought the last value of the listing so when the last one is bought it is no longer posted. I also do a lot of custom BTC orders where you can reserve BTC while you go out and buy a moneypak, so in the future if you ever want BTC message me and I can let you know what I have on hand so you can get a fast trade if you like how this one went. I always give priority to return buyers on BTC trades. Since the order is complete if you want added privacy feel free to put the mp card and receipt through the paper shredder to destroy anything that could link you to SR, but not mandatory. I&#039;m just paranoid. Feel free to save if for a bit then destroy it.&quot;<br /><br />Nothing ever showed up in the account and&nbsp; no record of the transaction in blockchain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Namedeclined&nbsp; is unresponsive to email at this point.<br /><br />$200 lighter.&nbsp; This whole system is way more trouble than it&#039;s worth, even if I do need the medication, I can&#039;t afford to lose money like this and find it way to difficult and unreliable to fund through trusted means. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is why he replied at all, why not just take them?&nbsp; I have no real recourse obviously.<br />

				The statements that the user astonmartin2 are false. That user did make a BTC order from me and did get the money. We did it through escrow so that way if indeed say I did scam him he would have been able to leave a 1/5 feedback and leave that on my feedback for all of Silk Road to see and that would ruin my vendor account. Think to yourselves why would I build a good rep on SR with good feedback, lots of fans, over 300 transactions and then one day do an order where the moneypak code was provided through escrow and scam him out of $200? It would be the last $200 I ever make on SR because although it is fee to order my moneypak for BTC listing I have people provide the code through escrow so they feel safe and can leave feedback after the order and know that if they did get scammed or something went wrong they could easily ruin me. When astonmartin2 first addressed me on the issue he was not polite. I explained that out of all the orders I have done it is possible for me to make a mistake or for tor to cut out when I hit send to send a buyer the BTC, and in the past people have tried to scam me the vendor out of BTC by saying the exact same line he did, so I wanted to do a good job looking the order over to solve it and make sure if there was a mistake, then fix it and if he was trying to scam me then bring in an admin. I even offered to bring in an admin from the start and he turned it down. I did get to the bottom of the order and either I filled out the transfer and calculated the amount to give him and forgot to hit send and just logged off or I did hit send and tor cut out or the connection was dropped. He DID GET HIS MONEY after I went over my accounts tabs on SR and even dropped the exchange fee to give him a better deal. I told him I understood how frustrating a mistake on an order can be and how I understand how much he really really wants to get those pills and dig right into them. He thanked me for fixing it and left a 5/5 feedback on the order, but never came back to the forums to fix what he said. I suggest everyone go to my profile and flip through my feedback and decide for yourselves who you believe; a person who uses SR from time to time or an established vendor that is well known on SR? Here is the log of messages from the order. I never disclose this kind of thing and always erase and destroy messages frequently, but this has me so heated I am disclosing them. I ALWAYS know if I am mentioned on the forums.<br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-08<br />Hi there,<br />Don&#039;t mean to be a pest, but I noticed that you pulled your moneypak listing. I was wondering if you were going to be able to fulfill my current order or should I use another provider?<br />Thanks a bunch!<br /><br />ME 2013-01-08<br />Thank you for the order. I just sent you the BTC. The reason the ad is no longer up is because when vendors post ads on SR they have to choose how many times it can be bought or inventory on hand. I usually set it at 3 - 5 depending on how many BTC I have, this way when I am away for a few hours before I check back I do not get 10 orders for BTC when i can only fill around 3 or so and that way I do not have to cancel orders and waste the time of buyers or upset them that way. You actually got lucky and bought the last value of the listing so when the last one is bought it is no longer posted. I also do a lot of custom BTC orders where you can reserve BTC while you go out and buy a moneypak, so in the future if you ever want BTC message me and I can let you know what I have on hand so you can get a fast trade if you like how this one went. I always give priority to return buyers on BTC trades. Since the order is complete if you want added privacy feel free to put the mp card and receipt through the paper shredder to destroy anything that could link you to SR, but not mandatory. I&#039;m just paranoid. Feel free to save if for a bit then destroy it.<br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-08<br />I don&#039;t have any btc in my account, can you please advise?<br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-08<br />My BTC address for SR is ################<br />I&#039;m not even seeing any unconfirmed transactions with this address. Are you sure you transferred? <br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-08<br />Really getting nervous here...<br />http://blockchain.info/address/##########################<br />The block chain is showing that the transfer to my account was never even initiated.<br />Are you sure you didn&#039;t send the BTC to the wrong person? <br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-09<br />It looks like I got scammed.<br />Stealing from sick people in need of medications is a really crappy thing to do, but I guess that&#039;s the world we live in.<br />I hope that you eventually find a way to make a living that doesn&#039;t involve hurting other people.<br /><br />ME 2013-01-09<br />Wait I never scammed you. Let me check the account history ok. I&#039;ll work this out with you. I&#039;ve been falsely accused of this once before and we worked it out and turns out someone stole their mp code before I could cash it and it took a few days but we fixed it. I&#039;ll fix this one as well ok. Just for your info I know what it is like to be sick and need medication and be unable to go without and am aware many BTC buyers are the same as me. My feedback does not mention me ever scamming someone. My BTC orders have the highest feedback out of any item. If you feel I did scam you then lets bring in an admin to fix this. The BTC was sent to you SR username and not an address so I&#039;m going to look into this and fix it ok. Keep in mind we did this with escrow in order to avoid the possibility of a scam. This means if I did scam the buyer could leave that in the feedback and it would ruin me. Plus with all the work I&#039;ve put into SR scamming a small trade like yours would not be worth ruining all I&#039;ve worked for. I know it must be frustrating, but be logical and thankful I am willing to help you where as most would not.<br /><br />ME 2013-01-09<br />Ok so I went over my SR account history tab and I think I know how to fix this. If it was a fault of mine such as tor cut out when I hit send (has happened in the past) or I cashed the mp and got the message ready to send to you, then calculated it then somehow did not send it to you or sent it to the wrong username, then I will have to repay you and take the loss. So for me to send you the money and sort this out I need two things from you.<br />1. the amount that was on the moneypak<br />2. a screen shot of the accounts history of your SR account uploaded to onion image uploader<br />Onion image uploader is this : http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/<br />After that if your accounts tab does not show a transaction from me I&#039;ll simply resend the the money to you , however you will get extra BTC as I will cut the exchange rate fee from 5% down to 2.5% as a way to pay for my error. Once again I know it must be frustrating, but this is a business for me and something I work hard at and have no reason to scam you and always conduct my self professionally on SR, so with that said like I mentioned above if it is an error that is my fault I will give you the discount as payment for the mistake. I have done close to 1,000 orders on SR (SR caps the number shown at 300 on profiles for privacy), get around 50 messages a day and have a few orders to fill a day. With that said like any business delays, mistakes and issues can arise.<br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-10<br />I&#039;m sorry, we&#039;re cool if you can send me the coins.<br />I hope you can also understand why I would come to the conclusion I did.<br />The moneypak was $200<br />The uploader is down at the moment.<br />You can check my blockchain at... #####################<br /><br />ME 2013-01-10<br />Not sure if it was tor cutting out or me being absent minded or a simple mistake on my end but I went over balances transaction by transaction and yours did not get sent. So i just sent you BTC at the rate of 2.5% fee not 5% and at the current value. Sorry for whatever the mistake was and glad we fixed it. Hopefully it doesn&#039;t effect the feedback.<br /><br />astonmartin2 2013-01-10<br />It&#039;s all good. Thank you very much!<br />Won&#039;t affect feedback.<br /><br />ME 2013-01-10<br />Glad we got it settled. I will say this, not every person here on SR would be willing to work it out some would just want to cause as much fuss as possible and even after getting the money still leave a 1/5 feedback and I had a mean person drop me from 100% down to 98% feedback recently because they couldn&#039;t follow my instructions to download photoshop that I sold them, so thank you for being as professional as I am and as I said before in the future you can reserve BTC while you run out and buy a mp and I give priority to previous customers and even do custom BTC orders so if my ad is not up like it is now you can message me to ask how many BTC I have on hand and decide if you want to get a custom order.<br />

				Judging by namedeclined&#039;s post, seems as though he has been more than fair. Even though he made a mistake, he rectified it and lowered the exchange rate from 5% down to 2.5%, giving the buyers more coins. Importantly, he conducted himself in a polite and courteous manner, even after being accused of being a scammer. Well done namedeclined. +1

				To be fair to the OP, when the OP made this thread, his moneypak had been cashed and he had not received any bitcoins for it.&nbsp; When he made this thread, the vendor had not yet realized his mistake, so of course the OP felt scammed at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe the OP can edit the title of his thread now that things have been figured out.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad to see that everything turned out well!&nbsp; I&#039;ll edit the thread title since the vendor didn&#039;t scam the OP.&nbsp; OP, you can edit the title again however you see fit!
