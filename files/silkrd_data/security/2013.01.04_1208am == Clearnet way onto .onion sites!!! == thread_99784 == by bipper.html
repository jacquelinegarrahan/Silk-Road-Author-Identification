				Hi, and a happy new year to you all...!<br /><br />So, I was mooching about on the boring clearnet earlier and came across a site called &quot;.onion.to&quot;... This site basically allows or claims to let you onto onion sites such as SR and BMR without using Tor.. <br /><br />They have a directory with the urls on the website, being the cautious soul I am I didnt try to use the site on any of my devices, however I used a computer at work and sure enough it got me to the SR login page, or one that appeared to be it. Obviously I didnt try to log on. Whats this all about then anyway, can anyone shed any light on it??<br /><br />Is this site sending you to the real SR?<br /><br />Is it a scam, maybe watching key strokes to access accounts or something like along those lines..?<br /><br />Anyone got any ideas??

				Yep, I think it send you to the real SR.<br /><br />However, I wouldn&#039;t even visit the URL (much less log in) through clear net.<br /><br />Not sure as to the .to action or what the purpose is, only that I would avoid it like the plague :)

				Completely agree. <br /><br />I can see some careless people using it, folk can find the whole Tor thing bewildering.<br /><br />I hope its not as dodgy as I suspect it is, LE or scammers. If it has to be there I hope its just for the lazy or technophobe who soon learn that its not a good idea to be there..

				I use it for the forums because it is faster and I&#039;m not anonymous.<br /><br />I would never in a million years use it if I wanted to remain anonymous.<br />

				A normal connection to a hidden service goes like this<br /><br />Tor client -&gt; entry guard -&gt; middle relay -&gt; rendezvous point &lt;- exit node &lt;-&nbsp; middle relay &lt;- entry guard &lt;- hidden service<br /><br />The client and hidden service are anonymous to each other, since the only see their path up to the rendezvous point.<br /><br />onion.to is a proxy to the Tor network, so the connection goes like this<br /><br />clearnet user -&gt; onion.to -&gt; rendezvous point &lt;- exit node &lt;- middle relay &lt;- entry guard &lt;- hidden service<br /><br />The hidden service is still protected, but the user isn&#039;t.<br /><br />onion.to contacts the hidden service for you, so it knows your IP address and the hidden service you&#039;re visiting. Theoretically it doesn&#039;t log, but we don&#039;t know that for sure. If the onion.to server is seized by LE, they could get that info. So, it&#039;s not safe to use onion.to.
