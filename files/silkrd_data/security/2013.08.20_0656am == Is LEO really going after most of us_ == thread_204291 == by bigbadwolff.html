				The main interest of the DEA is making as much money as possible. I don&#039;t remember where I read it, but the amount of busts in recent years didn&#039;t increase significantly. The amount of money they collected during the busts did increase.

				Found it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If the DEA is using NSA intelligence, the questionably legal technique hasn&#039;t necessarily led to more arrests. The number of domestic arrests by the DEA has remained steady since 2001, with an average of about 31,000 per year, according to the Department of Justice.<br /><br />However, there has been a large increase in the value of seized assets from drug busts and raids. In 2001, the total value of seized assets by all federal agencies was less than $400 million, with the DEA accounting for about $200 million of that. <br /><br />By 2010, the total value in assets was nearly $1.8 billion - the largest amount in U.S. history - with the DEA involved in nearly $800 million.<br /><br />The current incarnation of the NSA surveillance program, in which phone records and emails have been stored, began in 2001, the Guardian reported. The program began less than a month after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.wnem.com/story/23079065/dept-of-justice-investigates-dea-raids-using-nsa-surveillance

				The truth is the DEA really would like to get everyone using SR. Just because you are only buying small amounts of narcotics does not make you safe. Sure, they would like to nap the high-end distributors, but they wouldn&#039;t mind picking up the buyers as well.<br /><br />If you purchase narcotics through SR, you are utilizing the use of the federal mail system to facilitate the trafficking of controlled substances. This is a serious crime. This is why it is vital to exercise extreme caution when using the site, and it is crucial you communicate as safely as possible.

				I love the quote that goes something like the following: &quot;No man ever regretted being too secure, but many have regretted not being secure enough&quot;.<br /><br />I think that was posted by Astor, who by the way, is probably one of the smartest people I&#039;ve seen post on the net, much less SR. He has many posts that will guide you to be as safe as possible. I would say some of it is maybe a little overkill if you are small time buyer, but either way you look it, extra layers are never a bad idea.<br /><br />Bottom line is as follows, no evidence = no case, if you play your cards right (ie. keep your mouth shut if you do interact with LE), don&#039;t sign for packages if you are not expecting to have to sign (ie. domestic shipments), anything to support plausible deniability.<br /><br />And if you are that worried about an LE interaction, there are some GREAT videos on youtube from a group called &quot;Flex Your Rights&quot; that have some tutorials on how to deal with the police, the scumbag lying ass tactics they use, and what do if they are pressing you to search your car / home whatever. They also have some speeches from lawyers and actual LE that all say the same thing. If you interact with the police, DON&#039;T TALK TO THE POLICE. You may think you are slick enough to not get caught up in their deceitful ways and divulge info that could get you arrested but you aren&#039;t, unless you are ex-LE or maybe an attorney. Talking to the cops and thinking you are smart enough to get around their questions is about as smart as stepping into a boxing ring with an Olympic boxer after you got boxing lessons for a week (ok maybe a little exaggerated, but you get the point). Now of course you have to use common sense, such as if they ask to search your house or car, you say no. Sure they may search anyway, but if they do, it will get thrown out. I don&#039;t know of any statistics, but I would bet money that more people end up in jail or arrested because of their own mouth than any other reason and these videos will help prepare you for that dreadful situation should it ever happen to you.

				Little guys don&#039;t really have to worry, at least not directly about yourselves. You aren&#039;t worth the resources in most cases. However, if you are sloppy, you could lead to someone else&#039;s downfall.

				The DEA really doesn&#039;t care about you. If the goal is big busts, which equal big confiscations of property, you aren&#039;t in their sights. <br /><br />Your local police&#039;s narcotic division do care about you though. Just as much as they care about catching a small time buyer or deal on the street. You&#039;re just harder to catch. But if you make yourself low handing fruit, they&#039;re not going to pass up such easy pickings.

Motherfuckers who think their ass will age like wine. If you mean it turns to vinegar...it does. If you mean it gets better with age...it don&#039;t.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;These words were never more relevant.&nbsp; Seriously though, if you are careful, the worst thing that happens, is you might have your mail privileges revoked, you might have to go back to Memphis, but at least you ain&#039;t getting raped by Zed.
