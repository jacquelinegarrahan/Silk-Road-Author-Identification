				Hello!<br />Where I live we have public mailboxes, a building where you get your bills advertises and such, in a small vault. (individual mailbox)<br />-You have your personal mailbox with a key and all that.<br />Now we have a post office too, you receive a mail to the mailbox which invites you to take the mail or package from the post office.<br /><br />My question is, where do I pick up my package? at the post office? or the mailbox?<br />And if I receive it at the post office, is that safe?<br /><br />Additional Info<br />-I have ordered a shirt online and got it delivered to the post office.<br />I also got mail from the government (from the army) and I got it from the post office.<br /><br />OK so thx ahead, I am very eager and looking forward my first purchase!

				You might want to look back through the posts of &quot;janetreno&quot;, a user here who worked for a time as a postal inspector intern.&nbsp; [ dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;area=showposts;u=730 ]&nbsp; I&#039;d bet that your question may have been discussed in one of those threads.<br /><br />Either way -- post office or home -- be very wary of a controlled delivery where you&#039;re asked to sign for your package.&nbsp; LE is unlikely to stake out either location for personal use amounts so, unless that&#039;s *not* the case, I don&#039;t see that it would make much difference.<br /><br />

				Thank you very much crunchy frog! :)<br />Ive seen the fake name post but now I read it a little further, it solved my fake name problem ;) ty<br /><br />But, if the mail is not sent to the personal mailbox, I probably gotta pick it up from the post office desk aswell sign it.<br />-My starting question was, do I gonna receive the mail to the post office or mailbox, I really dont know where I gonna get it, probably just gotta try and see for myself, when Ill figure out how to pay with paypal :X<br /><br />so, if the letter is indeed get into the post office, all I can do is pick it up from the desk and sign for it. No other way. Not that I know of.<br /><br />okay, thx again Cfrog
