				So I&#039;m pretty much a security noob, and any tips you may have could be helpful.<br />As a beginner, I&#039;ve been using Tor Browser Bundle for accessing Tor most of the time. I&#039;ve heard Liberte is the better option, and I plan to switch to using it as my only access point to Tor, but I have two major questions first:<br /><br />First, I&#039;d like to add some more software. Now as the official Liberte FAQ states, the way to do this would be to build a custom image. Frankly, I don&#039;t know where to start with that. Is that something that a beginner can learn quickly? If not, are there any reliable pre-built custom Liberte builds I can get a hold of? Too be honest, I can survive without adding new software, but I wanted to add KeePass, as I&#039;ve already built up a fairly extensive database that I don&#039;t want to have to replicate into the Liberte default &quot;Figaro&#039;s Password Manager 2&quot; just because that would take time, and I prefer KeePass. I also wanted to add Truecrypt as trusting the security of the OTFE encrypted volume for everything seems like I&#039;m putting all my eggs into one basket. Again I realize that neither of these are absolutely necessary, but I would prefer it if I could add them.<br /><br />Second, I need to make sure that everything is fine and dandy and clean on my PC. As I said, I have been using Tor Browser Bundle on my comp, running Windows XP, for several weeks. I have not actually made a purchase on here as of yet. I still want to clear out most, if not all, traces of my Silk Road and Silk Road Forums usage. I&#039;ve read other threads advocating DBAN for this, but I was wondering if I could just run CCleaner with the clear free space option enabled, with secure file deletion set at 7 passes. I know DBAN would be technically more effective, but is it absolutely necessary?

				Hey Man, welcome to the &#039;Road.<br /><br />I&#039;m using a Liberte Linux liveUSB right now and I don&#039;t really have any need for those other programs you want to add to the build.&nbsp; Not necessary, especially if you&#039;re just going to be a small-time buyer. <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to deal, then maybe yeah, look into customizing your own build.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be like learning a new language, so if you don&#039;t have mad&nbsp; computer skiiz, then I&#039;d pass and use the Liberte as is. <br /><br />As for any files on your PC, if you&#039;re super paranoid, just reinstall the OS and don&#039;t touch any darknet stuff with it again...boot to your Liberte Linux liveUSB for access to the &#039;Road and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I basically memorized the onion links to the forums and to the &#039;Road, and that&#039;s all I need to access, no desire to save any type of files or such locally.<br /><br />Anyways, hope some of that helped.<br /><br />Omega Rushmore<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank you both of you, and especially you, Guru, as this is the second time I asked a question and you responded with a thorough, highly informative post. I think I will try Tails out, as it seems to be able to fix both of the problems I had. <br />Also since you wouldn&#039;t trust CCleaner, does that mean you would use DBAN for this, or something else?

				<br />I&#039;m a regular Tails user &amp; I start in Bridge mode to solve the entry guard issue.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />As Guru wrote earlier, hit the TAB key at the Tails menu. This will take you to a command-line where you can modify the boot options.&nbsp; Type in &#039;bridge&#039; (without the quotes) along with the other options such as truecrypt.&nbsp; When Tails starts it takes you the configuration screen for using a bridge.&nbsp; I keep a text file with the three bridges I got from bridges.torproject.org so I can enter them.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pain because it has to be done each time you start Tails, but it solves the &quot;no persistent guard&quot; problem.<br /><br /><br />Secondly, you can use Keepass but it must be installed at the command line each time you start Tails.&nbsp; After you have your bridges configured open a root terminal window and, at the command line, type <br />&nbsp; apt-get update&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />When that finishes type in <br />&nbsp; apt-get install keepassx<br />&nbsp; <br />You&#039;ll have KeepassX installed &amp; accessable from the drop-down menu.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s a lot of work but you can use the Keepass database you already have.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />[ Edit: there may be another version of Keepass for Linux out there, in which case you&#039;ll either use keepass2 or just plain keepass when you type in &quot;apt-get install xxxx&quot; ]
