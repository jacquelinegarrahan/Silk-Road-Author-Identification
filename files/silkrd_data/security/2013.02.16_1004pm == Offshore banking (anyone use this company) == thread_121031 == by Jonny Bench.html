				I have a friend who unloaded about 75k USD into a Liberty Reserve account.&nbsp; It was an enormous pain in the ass, and required hundreds of money transfers, costing him thousands of dollars.&nbsp; It was worth it to him because he was in some legal trouble, and the feds were about to seize his assets (had seized most of them already), and he was about to be sentenced (he&#039;s now doing 15 years for trafficking).&nbsp; I have a Liberty Reserve account, but I can&#039;t tell you much about funding it, because it&#039;s a pain in the ass and you have to work with so many offshore vendors that it&#039;s impossible to know if your next transfer is the one where they take the money and run.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, it&#039;s hard as fuck unless you&#039;re already a millionaire and you have people who can do that shit for you.

				wow, it would be alot easier and faster just to find a bunch of btc exchangers and do cash deposits of $9k at various banks. You could turn 200K into btc in a week. Aint no fed gonna touch that, and by the time you get out of jail you&#039;ll be a millionaire!

				Yeah, he wasn&#039;t a BTC kinda guy.&nbsp; I called him a friend, but he&#039;s more like, &quot;this guy I went to high school with who crashed at my place when his wife kicked him out every six months.&quot;&nbsp; But, for a loser he made a lot of money selling blow.&nbsp; Go figure.
