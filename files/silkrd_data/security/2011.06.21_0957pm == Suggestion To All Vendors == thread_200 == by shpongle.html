				Hello fellow Silk Roaders,<br /><br />I am noticing a disturbing trend among many of the new vendors on Silk Road - they don&#039;t have a GPG key, or one listed.<br />If you are a vendor, getting a GPG key and posting it on your SR profile should be mandatory.<br /><br />I, for one, refuse to send out my address unencrypted - which means if you don&#039;t have GPG, I won&#039;t order from you. I&#039;m sure a few other people feel the same way.<br /><br />I understand GPG can be confusing, but if you can&#039;t spend the time it takes to learn how to use it - you probably shouldn&#039;t be selling drugs over the internet. That being said, there are many GPG tutorials posted around the &#039;net, and even on this forum.<br /><br />No more ranting, that was my 2 cents&nbsp; ;)

				Buyers: Do not do business with vendors without the protection of encryption.<br /><br />Vendors: Please be proactive about destroying the addresses of your customers. It may be convenient, but please do not keep a &quot;little-black-book&quot; of your SR customers&#039; addresses. This is extremely dangerous for both you, the vendor, as well as your customers.

				PGP for addresses should be a must. Any database can be hacked and having any identifying information outside of your won control is a huge risk. <br /><br />Everyone should also put PGP code on their user page (even if nothing else). When I click on someone and their page comes up with a PGP public key, it&#039;s a great reminder to encrypt to them before messaging.

				This isn&#039;t about trusting SR. It&#039;s about protecting yourself against would-be attackers. SR has even warned us that he&#039;s received threats against us. Are you prepared for such an attack? If SR&#039;s server is compromised, would your address be available to anyone in plaintext, or is your sensitive data encrypted?&nbsp;

				All great points.<br />I believe SR said addresses are not stored on any kind of database, and are only temporarily available to the vendor. <br /><br />But as a buyer, a large portion of the risk is on your end. Using encryption reduces some of the risk, but I still think everyone needs to be aware of the potential dangers of buying. I really don&#039;t want to have to turn down any more vendors who refuse to use PGP.

				Heh, even addresses stored temporarily is dangerous. GPG is as simple as knowing how to use your right mouse button.&nbsp; The choice is either learn to use GPG which is very easy, or go to prison.&nbsp; I think learning GPG is probably a lot less painful than Brutus having his way with your bung hole in prison.

				GreenCo does not insist on PGP except for wholesale deals. Even if you trust Silk Road, you have to assume that information lasts forever and someone will eventually read anything not encoded. PGP addresses seems like a sensible step, though I am not sure about how much the cops of 2075 will care who bought weed on SR. If you plan on running for president you should absolutely use PGP to buy our weed.
