				So I&#039;m thinking of trying a new BTC service (cavirtex). I can deposit CAD directly from my bank account, but i have to verify my details. Let&#039;s say I do this, convert to BTC, then transfer to my SR account.<br /><br />Is there any way they will know that I am depositing the BTC to a SR account, or is this fairly safe? Any flaws with this?

				If you&#039;re buying small amounts it doesn&#039;t even matter.<br /><br />Its the people buying bulk for resale and the vendors that need to really worry about bitcoin anonymity. Obviously bear it in mind and don&#039;t forget about it.. but it&#039;s okay.

				Cavirtex is a good service, their customer service is surprisingly good.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty easy to move your coins to instawallet and then to SR - so i don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t.<br />But it&#039;s up to you like Kappacino said.<br /><br />All bitcoin transactions are public, but by moving your BTCs around it makes it virtually impossible to track.<br />Bitfrog used to be really popular for this - they would move your BTCs around in a bunch of small transfers <br />over a few hours, but they charged a fee and I can&#039;t seem to find their URL anywhere.

				good info, but something is still unclear to me. why move them around before depositing to my SR account? is there any way to know that my deposit address is an SR address?

				I think really only DPR/SR Admin would know this. So, some users mix it up themselves first, some don&#039;t. Depends a lot on your level of exposure here, and it&#039;s always a personal preference at the end of the day. $10,000/month vendor? Probably want some obscurity. $50-$250/month buyer? Probably not a big deal to transfer directly.<br /><br />Our more security-minded members will tell you that it can never hurt to do more to make yourself harder to trace, and I personally would agree with them. But I haven&#039;t heard of any fallout from direct transfers...

				I recommend BitCoin Fog for mixing up your coins before they make it to your SR account. They take 1-3% and mix all the users bitcoins up in a pool, then you can withdraw them in segments to up to 20 different addresses. Great service.

				BitCoin fog is a good service, I used to use them when I first started - but, now that I know about instawallet and a how to use a wallet on my PC it seems silly to pay for that kind of service. Especially considering how long it takes.<br /><br />But I still use them when I&#039;m feeling lazy. $1-$3 on every 100$ you transfer really isn&#039;t that much
