				Okay, I&#039;ve been lurking/researching for a little while now and think I&#039;m ready to take the plunge and try to get some BC to SR. Here&#039;s what I&#039;m looking at:<br /><br />MT.gox account created via some throwaway email accounts &gt;&gt; payment through bitinstant &gt;&gt; payment to bitinstant through walmart &gt;&gt; ??<br /><br />Pretty simple setup and I hate to be another scrub asking the same questions but I&#039;ve read many threads and want someone to pat me on the head and say &quot;go ahead, it&#039;s fine.&quot; you know?<br /><br />I got the Zipzap slip printed so my real question is:<br /><br />I go to a walmart checkout line, hand him/her the zipzap slip, hand him/her cash, leave, money shows up in mt.gox, proceed to trade for (the now much more expensive since I first started researching) BC, then send the BC to SR via the long bitcoin address found in my SR account. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to be very small time (under 1k a year I&#039;d imagine in purchases), so I&#039;m not too concerned about adding any other steps. Or should I? I was looking at coinapult, could I send from mtgox &gt; coinapult &gt; SR and be better off? <br /><br />Also, I figured I&#039;d start with a minimum bitinstant purchase just to make sure it all comes through and then try a larger cash deposit. <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Snoop

				coinapult doesnt do anything, dont need mt.gox to use bitinstant, dont use mt.gox cause they work with the feds so out of principle they can go f themselves. also they can freeze your funds until u show them real id. u can go straight from bitinstant to SR or if ur paranoid that SR is run by leo u can go bitinstant-&gt;bitcoin fog-&gt;SR. Thats all there is to it.

				Really? I&#039;m doing all this extra shit for nothing? So if I just go to bitinstant and put in my SR&#039;s bitcoin addy it&#039;ll go straight there no problems? I just sent a couple bucks to mtgox but if it really is that bad then I&#039;ll just let it die there. How do I get my cash to BC without mtgox then?

				Suggest reading my B$ guide first. It doesn&#039;t give you the exact number of steps or specific providers of services because they change all the time, but it explains the theory behind being anonymous with bitcoin relatively well.<br /><br />There is something called 2 factor anonymity, which much like 2 factor authentication, is much more secure than doing one or the other instead.<br /><br />Anyway, the post/thread is in my signature.

				I appreciate the reply Pine. I already got my first little sample of BC into SR as of today so Yay! :D I&#039;ll be checking out your post for my next venture though.
