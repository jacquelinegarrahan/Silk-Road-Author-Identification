				Hey guys, just wondering how safe this method would be/if there is any chance or reason anything would happen.&nbsp; Not a big player, just thinking of buying one or two things here and there.&nbsp; Here it is:<br /><br />1. Send cash to get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />2. Tumble through a few instawallets changing ip address every time and making sure this is all through tor of course.<br /><br />3. Send coins to SR<br /><br />4. Have item shipped to a house where I know no one is any longer living(this year at least) with a fake name.&nbsp; The house still gets mail, but the owners very rarely check it.<br /><br />I know there is a case of diminishing returns in terms of security.&nbsp; For an extremely low level buyer would this be appropriate or OK.&nbsp; Buying a flash drive and putting Tails or Liberte on it seems to be somewhat of hassle.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any feedback/thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks :P

				The weak link in your plan is using a fake name at an unoccupied address. This could raise a red flag with the postie if they know the area well enough.

				Yeah, I was thinking about that but I actually know the names of the people who lived there last year and they still get mail all the time.&nbsp; Still a little sketchy, but worst comes to worst I don&#039;t get what was ordered.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather play it safer that way than risk anything else as I&#039;m a bit paranoid about this stuff.&nbsp; It seems this way would be pretty untraceable, but like I said I&#039;m a newbie and don&#039;t know for sure

				I have been thinking about using get-bitcoin for a little bit now. I see you say number 2 is not a good idea, could you elaborate. Would it be better to just have it deposited into my SR account or should I do something else? I use the SR for my coins now, but that can take some time seeing as how there is only a couple legit and reliable bit coin sellers here and they can get backlogged and I (as probably most others here) want to get my coins fast so I can have it on the way and enjoy the benefits of this awesome place&nbsp; ;D

				Dont send cash to get-btc in the mail if thats what you are planning on doing. Would take forever and you could lose that money. Do a cash deposit with get-btc or bitinstant-&gt;mt. gox. if you use Mt gox do not access through tor. <br /><br />Send the coins to an instawallet, then send them to a couple instawallets that you only access through tor. Dont send coins directly from get-btc or mt gox to SR, so I dont know what qtc is talking about. <br /><br />DO NOT use a fake name and sketchy house that no one should be having packages delivered to, unless you are willing to completely lose your money. And then sure as hell do not complain to the vendor your package didnt arrive and expect a refund. <br /><br />QTC, please explain why you do not suggest instawallet... you provide no reasoning which is not helpful.

				My guess to why QTC says no InstaWallet would be if something does happen, its one more thing you have to deal with, and money laundering is as bad if not more then the drug charges you may face.<br /><br />But thats just a wild ass guess..
