				I&#039;ve been reading through the SR forums and elsewhere trying to figure out the best way to get bitcoins into my SR wallet without it being traceable.&nbsp; I&#039;m concerned because the money I sent to a bitcoin exchanger is traceable back to me.&nbsp; So far, the advice has been to do a series of transfers that look something like:<br /><br />BitCoin Exchanger -&gt; Wallet#1 -&gt; Wallet#2 -&gt; Wallet#3 -&gt; SR<br /><br />And if you use the bitcoin client as each intermediate wallets, you can delete wallets 2 and 3 when you&#039;re done, making things tough to track down.<br /><br />However, a lot of sources say that *all* bitcoin transactions can be publicly viewed, so that anyone can see where some specific bitcoins started.&nbsp; If this is the case, then doing the above won&#039;t work, because you could just follow the coins to their final destination.<br /><br />I hear about sites where you can transfer in some bitcoins and withdraw different ones of the same value, thus making it untraceable, but I haven&#039;t found any reputable looking ones.<br /><br />Also, I hear that SR tumbles the bitcoins itself, so it&#039;s not necessary to do it elsewhere.&nbsp; Is that correct?<br /><br />All in all, this is pretty confusing.&nbsp; I&#039;d really appreciate it if anyone could give me any advice about this!&nbsp; :)

				The way money travels is:<br /><br />Dwolla =&gt; MTGox =&gt; SL<br /><br />or<br /><br />Dwolla =&gt; MTGox =&gt; Wallet1...N =&gt; SL<br /><br />The first way is silly. It identifies you, as a exchange user, sending money to SL.<br /><br />The second way is the way to go. Because how is in control of wallet 1 through N is the question. So, if you send the money through your bitcoin client (that happens to be installed on an encrypted disk using TrueCrypt, right? right!?!?!) then nobody can prove WHO was in control of the coins once they left your exchange account (you can say &quot;Hey, I paid a dude for roses! I didn&#039;t know he would use the money to get drugz!!!&quot;). If you prefer not to use your local bitcoin client as a pitstop for the coinz you plan on getting contraband with, then I recommend going through InstaWallet, and going there using Tor. Again, the idea is to break the chain of custody of the coins.<br /><br />Tumblers are a joke in my opinion. Intermediate anonymous wallets are the way to go me thinks.<br /><br />Remember, they will have to prove who purchased stuff. If they can&#039;t prove you controlled the money, well then...

				One thing about tumblers. SL already does it for you, so there&#039;s no proof what YOUR coins bought :)<br />The paid coin tumblers are useless in my opinion.

				Okay, I think I&#039;ve got it figured out.&nbsp; Basically I&#039;m doing the way I said, and not worrying about tumbling because SR already does that.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s pretty safe to say that no one can tie my bitcoins to me at this point:<br /><br />I send them through several intermediate wallets which are running on linux virtual machines, all of which are connecting via tor and using a different identity.&nbsp; When I&#039;m done with the transfer, I securely delete the virtual machines so that the only trace of them left is in the bitcoin blocks, but no way of knowing they were run on my computer.

Where coins go is recorded in the blocks and is a public information. who is in control of the wallet is what you want to hide. so you can either go through InstaWallet+TOR which makes it impossible for LE to prove YOU send the money from InstaWallet to SL.<br /><br />The idea behind TrueCrypt&#039;ing your entire disk, is this: You get shit shipped to you. LE intercepts. LE does controlled delivery. LE raids your house and finds a laptop*. Remember, LE has to prove in court of law that YOU control the money and YOU purchased the stuff (again, transactions are public, so the fact that a transfer between a wallet and your SL wallet&nbsp; is public knowledge). If you&#039;re disk is encrypted, then they can&#039;t prove shit BECAUSE unless they decrypt it, they cannot prove that the SOURCE wallet sits on YOUR computer. Oh btw, you do not have to tell them your password (they will try to get it out of you through social engineering and fear tactics, DO NOT OPEN YOUR MOUTH), good old 5th Amendment protects you.<br /><br />Another thing you can use to strengthen your security is to use a password keeper on an encrypted volume. I use KeePass v2 on Windows 7 (my KeePass database is encrypted, AND it resides on a disk encrypted with TrueCrypt) and I have a backup copy of the password file and the KeePass software on my IronKey USB drive. I also have a TOR Browser Bundle on the same USB Key. This way ALL my information is AES-256bit encrypted. The only way LE can get to it is if I willingly tell them the password.<br /><br />Also, you can store your BitCoin wallet on your IronKey USB drive. Bitcoin client can be started with a parameter that points to its data directory.<br /><br />* YOU should never walk away from a laptop you&#039;re doing this on and leave it unlocked. Recently LE&#039;s used infrared camera and staged a fake package delivery to get a child predator off of his computer for a second, then they raided the house. Computer was unlocked, and they were able to gather evidence. NEVER leave your computer unattended if you&#039;re logged into SR etc.<br />

So there&#039;s no button to delete a wallet from inside the software - all you need to do is remove the software itself (specifically, it&#039;s the file called &#039;wallet.dat&#039; that you need to remove).<br /><br />The only problem with this is that each time you wanted to transfer coins into SR, you&#039;d need to start new wallets, and it takes time to download the blocks before you can use them (especially through TOR I&#039;d imagine). But that&#039;s a small price to pay for good anonymity. Just start them off 48H before you need to make the transfer I suppose.<br /><br />

				I think the thing that is being overlooked here is that (and correct me if I am wrong) when you send btc from mtgox you are not sending them to &#039;Silk Road&#039; you are sending them to an address, and the address you are sending them to changes each time you load the account page so there isn&#039;t anything showing a pattern on the other end.<br /><br />This is going from mtgox to SR, I imagine the same is also true from buyer to seller, none of your personal info in any way is tied to the bitcoins which is partially why SR uses it. The user can be quite foolish/careless and even without pub/private key pairs there is still no clear chain of custody from your bank account to the seller. Think of it this way:<br /><br />Bank account -&gt; MtGox<br /><br />Assuming both are in clearnet and you are not using Tor to access them once the USD hits MtGox and you buy btc there is a record of you buying the btc in some way, and then your account having btc of some sort.<br /><br />MtGox -&gt; Silk Road<br /><br />This is where the break in the chain of custody is from this point forward you sent a virtual currency to an address, that will not be used again, and does not contain metadata (i.e. info about the owner of that destination)<br /><br />Buyer -&gt; Seller<br /><br />Now because we have an escrow system you actually &#039;pay&#039; Silk Road, again since this is btc nothing identifies the destination owners information it&#039;s simply an address. Now once escrow payout occurs it becomes Silk Road that is paying the Seller, not the buyer, this is additionally key for purposes in US courts that makes a silk road purchase extremely hard to prove because this here breaks chain of custody even if everything else they had proof of, the way many US laws are written they have to effectively demonstrate that you had a transaction with an individual for illegal goods for a sum of money. In order to prove this they have to have some evidence of you providing the seller currency. Which isn&#039;t possible because 1 you aren&#039;t paying the seller, Silk Road is and 2 when you exchange btc there is no identifying information on the destination.<br /><br /><br />Bearing all of this in mind do I encrypt my address? Absolutely, but there is another way of anonyminity that consists of making sure that your SR packages, and online behavior in the clear shows standard patterns that are not suspicious. And always remember you use mtgox to learn how to daytrade with bitcoins so you can better understand how real stock trading works and you buy stuff online regularly in general.<br /><br />My postal delivery woman a while back noticed I recieved LP&#039;s and so at one point I had a seller send something in an LP carrier with a crap record they got at the local salvation army and ship a decent quantity of product in it quite easily, When she dropped it off (the LP having come from germany) I told her, &#039;Oh wow this is great, it&#039;s an autographed LP I have been waiting for!&#039; since she knew I recieved them regularly there was absolutely no suspicion of anything illicit.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about illusion and how you are able to blend in your behaviors with normal patterns that people don&#039;t think twice about.

Oh btw, you do not have to tell them your password (they will try to get it out of you through social engineering and fear tactics, DO NOT OPEN YOUR MOUTH), good old 5th Amendment protects you.<br /><br />Another thing you can use to strengthen your security is to use a password keeper on an encrypted volume. I use KeePass v2 on Windows 7 (my KeePass database is encrypted, AND it resides on a disk encrypted with TrueCrypt) and I have a backup copy of the password file and the KeePass software on my IronKey USB drive. I also have a TOR Browser Bundle on the same USB Key. This way ALL my information is AES-256bit encrypted. The only way LE can get to it is if I willingly tell them the password.<br /><br />Also, you can store your BitCoin wallet on your IronKey USB drive. Bitcoin client can be started with a parameter that points to its data directory.<br /><br />* YOU should never walk away from a laptop you&#039;re doing this on and leave it unlocked. Recently LE&#039;s used infrared camera and staged a fake package delivery to get a child predator off of his computer for a second, then they raided the house. Computer was unlocked, and they were able to gather evidence. NEVER leave your computer unattended if you&#039;re logged into SR etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />awesome response. 2 questions&nbsp; swim has is&nbsp; 1 if your laptop is confecated. and its not encrypted on a controlled d. you used an insta wallet+ tor so no problem can they see all the other files and possibly illegal software dl&#039;s and file new charges based on that? <br />2 so your saying the ip info isnt recorded they just need to find your wallet dat to confirmn the transfer? if someone has made 1 transfer from exchange &gt; bitcoin wallet&gt; SR does this compormise any future transactions for that wallet?<br /><br />its late that might not make sense if it does please help!! thanks again

				Thx for your reply.<br /><br />Somebody else here told me, that you can also do it the same way with using instawallet.org. Doing it this way, it might be a little bit more easy. What do you think?
