				I am not a fan of any encryption software that you pay for, open source, use true crypt it does the same thing, <br /><br /><br /><br />Regardless, if you use pgp encryption with 1024 bit min., you are safe- just make sure you dont use a damn simple bullshit passwrd. <br /><br /><br />Also remember, if they REALLY want you, they will spend the years and millions to get you. ;)

				Use FRN&#039;s - never the same serial number, combine any or all of the various numbers letters and more on the bill, make it a small bill- keep in wallet with other bills- DONT spend, but dont mark it in any obvious way either. <br /><br />Backup passwrds etc., in a true crypt file- I use a min 100+ passwrds at any given moment, and would never remember all. <br /><br />Better to use one-two for an encrypted file on truecrypt and a back up microdisk in a safe location (NOT your freezer dumbass)&nbsp; than to only use one psswrd or multiples and forget one.

				It all depends on how secure your life is, do you tell everyone in rl that you deal or buy online...;) if so- encryption aint shit- all they gotta do is get that girl you had your eye on to roll around with you and get your passwrds ;)

				As to the original question, full disk encryption isn&#039;t enough because they know you&#039;re using encryption, they might be able to compel you to disclose your keys. You need truecrypts hidden os as well, then they can&#039;t prove it exists, and you can safely give them the keys to your fde.

				Lesson 1 - when crossing international lines, NEVER show the BP your porn<br />Lesson 2 - NEVER create a separate drive- <br />Lesson 3 - use security that you cannot remember, and that relies on external cues that can be easily destroyed. <br />Lesson 4 - Dont deal in child porn its gross and if your already doing drugs...why? <br />Lesson 5 - Canada Ay&#039; <br /><br /><br />

				always create a container layer, its easy, first you truecrypt your whole drive with boot pw, then create a container called whatever container.exe , and make it 50mb, then in that container create another container that has all the good shit.&nbsp; truecrypt also has a setup for making like two partitiions or something, if you get set it up right then yeah its enough to be secure that your pc cant be cracked. now worry about how you are connecting to sr :)
