				Hey tribe,<br /><br />Was just about to pay my some cash into my mt gox account the same way i have many many times previously and luckily i checked the mtgox site to see if they had changed anything (not normally something i do seeing as i have my account info saved on my phone) and noticed the GBP cash deposit option was no longer there... <br /><br />When did this happen? unsure where to go next seeing how Intersango removed cash deposits a few months back.

				I just had a look, and I can still see it. (Funding options, add funds, GBP deposit (UK))<br />They do say &quot;Note: Direct cash deposits should not be made, as they may not be credited.&quot; but I paid in cash on Thursday, and I had the coins about 04:00 today, so they&#039;re still going through. I think the reason they say not to make cash deposits is because if you screw up the reference, you can&#039;t get the money back, as there&#039;s no proof it was you that paid it in.<br />You can still do cash deposits, but **MAKE SURE THE REFERENCE IS CORRECT. MINE RECENTLY CHANGED**, so double check your reference and you&#039;re good to go!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />P.S. Vlad1m1r does BTC for cash in the post if you&#039;re looking for alternatives. I&#039;ve never used, but heard only good things.

This coupled with the fact that cash deposits are still traceable (I worked as a cashier for two years!)&nbsp; - should be enough to convince people to use my cash in the mail service however I would say the cash deposit method is the next best thing provided you send your coins through BItcoinfog or a similar mixer after you&#039;ve bought them.<br /><br />MtGox will not allow you to access their site from a Torified connection without providing further identification, so you will also need to use a VPN to access it if you want to make sure you can&#039;t be traced by a simple check of your ISP&#039;s records. I suggest creating a new MtGox account each time too for each deposit and hope they don&#039;t lose your money.<br /><br />Of course all these problems disappear when you use my service OP - down to you to decide! :-)<br /><br />V.

				i posted this a week or so ago,i noticed a message on mtgox saying they cannot guarantee cash deposits in the uk will make it to your account,in other words dont bother making cash deposits,well thats how i read it,<br />to remain anonymous you cannot use mtgox or intersango as none offer cash deposits anymore

				I expect they will go the same way as Intersango.<br /><br />See my other post about traceability: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32788.0<br /><br />Yup, cash deposits in the UK are fairly safe, but not 100% I was a cashier once too! But all bank have CCTV etc.
