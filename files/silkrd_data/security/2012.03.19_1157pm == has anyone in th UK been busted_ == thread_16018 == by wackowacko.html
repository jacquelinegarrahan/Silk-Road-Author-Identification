				nope :) sold skunk for about 6 years and coke for 4 of those as well, never even seen the inside of a cell. shit a brick every time i saw a copper though, par for the course when you sell drugs i suppose. don&#039;t sell any more so i&#039;m not tempting fate with that statement :)<br /><br />if you were to get busted from buying from SR i think you&#039;d have to have a big enough delivery for &#039;possession with intent to distribute&#039; else they&#039;d just confiscate it at customs/the post office as it&#039;s not worth their time or money chasing up a gram of anything

				I&#039;ve only been pinched with personal before. Went to fuckin court though. Conditional discharge. Waste. <br /><br />I can&#039;t be fucked with the low end of dealing any more and i&#039;m not good enough with cash to get any further up the chain to make big bucks out of it so I just stick to my job, n doing personal use amounts of drugs nowadays.<br /><br />I have committed various other types of offenses but just never got caught....as Lim says, just lucky!

				Once an abandoned warehouse we were using for a rave got raided. Luckily we saw the cars/dogs outside before they bust in and I crotch&#039;d the half oz or so of weed I had on me at the time. However I forgot about the mench I had in my bag.. so I got a warning for that. I was there at the police station, high as the hills, with a half oz down my trou, getting a fucking moral lecture about the evils of drugs and whatever..<br /><br />They&#039;re such fucking self righteous assholes. I remember saying to one of the guys.. &quot;you&#039;ll probably go home after this and have a couple glasses of wine and a few cigs without even the slightest twinge of hypocrisy, won&#039;t you?&quot;. All the guy could say was &quot;weed leads to harder drugs.&quot; <br /><br />This is the level of ignorance we&#039;re dealing with here. As if harder drugs are a bad thing? Fucking cretins. I did end up rolling a blunt in the police station toilet though so that was a nice fuck you&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But I had to waddle out of that police station with these bags nearly falling out my trouser leg. I was thinking &quot;if worst comes to worst.. just say you&#039;re on a kebab diet and are really constipated&quot;. Luckily the situation didn&#039;t present itself. <br /><br />I think the only way the UK fuzz would bust you for SR stuff is if you ordered a massive order, suggestive of a dealing enterprise, from overseas. Royal mail is so jammed up anyway that its 100% that your shit will get through if its domestic. They don&#039;t scan SHIT. It really is funny.. the nature of the beast itself is what camouflages our orders. It&#039;s a good thing there&#039;s so much junk business mail, advertising, catalogs, phone bills, TV bills, bank statements, charity leaflets etc flying around. Without all that shit, royal mail might actually have the resources to do some detective work.

				I&#039;m a professional hacker and have a few million credit cards on my pc that&#039;s fraud.<br /><br />I have being dealing lsd and weed for a few years, but giving up IRL dealing.<br /><br />I have being involved in money laundering and will soon write an ebook on some of the methods I use in the future and sell it,<br /><br />It would be a good purchase as it&#039;s a unique method.<br /><br />The chances of getting caught for dealing weed are small, as they are more bothered about people who grow the stuff...<br /><br />In the uk it takes 3 reports before you get busted for weed fact!

				I&#039;ve been busted but not for drugs or anything to do with Silk Road. It was a technology crime a long time ago when IT was in it&#039;s infacy and the court case ended up getting thrown out and I got employed for a while by the company who bought the case. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure you&#039;re drug dealer&#039;s going to employ you though if you get busted!

				I have been arrested twice but never charged - ironically never for the laws I have actually broken!<br /><br />The first time was when I was on my way home from a bar where I&#039;d been working a late shift and I passed by a spot where earlier that evening a man vaguely matching my description (tall with dark hair) had apparently tried to grab a young girl.<br /><br />It was quite an instructive experience as I&#039;d read about the PEACE model used for interviewing by the Police and the new technique of the &quot;Conversation Management Approach&quot; which seeks to establish a dialogue between the suspect and the interviewing officer but hadn&#039;t actually experienced it first hand.<br /><br />Firstly they took my jeans, trainers and sweatshirt and gave me some very fetching prison regulation shorts to wear, then they insisted a Police Doctor interview me as I refused to say whether or not I was mentally ill&nbsp; - when she got nothing out of me, they let me cook in a cell overnight as they tried in vain to contact the alleged victim for an ID and then they interviewed me and asked about my sexual fantasies.<br /><br />At the end of the process I&#039;d been kept in for a little under 48 hours but obviously the victim in question when showed my photo said it wasn&#039;t me. They said I&#039;d needlessly prolonged things by refusing to answer any other questions and requesting that my own Solicitor be present(!) but as I&#039;ve said at some length in other threads, I think that largely this is your best strategy, even if you are guilty.<br /><br />After they switched the tape off and were about to let me go, I told the two female CID officers that while I applauded their efforts to keep the community safe and while they were ever polite and professional my honest assessment is that they&#039;re not that bright.

				Well said Guru,<br /><br />As I was waiting to be released one of the female CID officers came in and whispered to me confidentially that I really needed to &quot;get some help&quot; for my problems. (As I said they believed I had grabbed a young girl, even though I hadn&#039;t been there at the time!)<br /><br />I am usually icily polite towards the Police but this time I laughed in her face - perhaps as they often deal with people with low IQ&#039;s they have begun to believe that everyone is that stupid but it seems fairly obvious to me that even if you&#039;re taken to a different room and/or there are no obvious recording devices that anything you say is on the record.<br /><br />In the famous &quot;Don&#039;t talk to Cops&quot; Youtube video Officer Bruech also points out rightly that the tape recording of the interview isn&#039;t necessary at trial - if you said something to the Police they can just ask the person who was there. In an ideal world it would be your word against theirs&#039; but we don&#039;t live in an ideal world...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16018.msg273959#msg273959">Quote from: Guru on June 05, 2012, 03:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=16018.msg273454#msg273454">Quote from: vlad1m1r on June 04, 2012, 10:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I have been arrested twice but never charged - ironically never for the laws I have actually broken!<br /><br />The first time was when I was on my way home from a bar where I&#039;d been working a late shift and I passed by a spot where earlier that evening a man vaguely matching my description (tall with dark hair) had apparently tried to grab a young girl.<br /><br />It was quite an instructive experience as I&#039;d read about the PEACE model used for interviewing by the Police and the new technique of the &quot;Conversation Management Approach&quot; which seeks to establish a dialogue between the suspect and the interviewing officer but hadn&#039;t actually experienced it first hand.<br /><br />Firstly they took my jeans, trainers and sweatshirt and gave me some very fetching prison regulation shorts to wear, then they insisted a Police Doctor interview me as I refused to say whether or not I was mentally ill&nbsp; - when she got nothing out of me, they let me cook in a cell overnight as they tried in vain to contact the alleged victim for an ID and then they interviewed me and asked about my sexual fantasies.<br /><br />At the end of the process I&#039;d been kept in for a little under 48 hours but obviously the victim in question when showed my photo said it wasn&#039;t me.

				This is just a throwaway account for obvious reasons !&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />Had precisely 1 run in with the police, one sunday morning a group of about 8 police men and DI&#039;s ect turn up at the door of my 2 room flat with an explosives warrant. Apparently the chemical company I bought from had tipped them off , some magical line had been crossed (I bought almost exclusively heptane and petroleum ether) and I was now in imminent danger of blowing something up (if anyone knows what this supposed combination is that could make an explosive I&#039;d&nbsp; be interested to hear it!). So house full (literally) of police and they come across my cupboard of glassware (Im an chemist-in-training) and then my DMT extraction experiments! <br />As it happened I had given up on them a year ago but kept them around meaning to get the last of it out at some point. The only uspide to this royal screw up on my part was that I had smoked the last actual DMT crystals a couple of weeks previously. <br />Spun them some cock and bull story about dual solvent recrystallisation practise on unknown powder from my shady, drug filled past (backed up by salt crystals ect in my fridge - recystallisation is actually pretty fun whatever the material in question).<br />Plods saw cupboard full of chemicals and refused to touch them in case they exploded -&nbsp; thats a quote. Called in a scientist to remove the highly hazardous white spirits and so forth after he asked me what I was doing. After tossing the rest of my house and finding my GBH they went on their merry way (only took them 8 hours!).<br />One year later I get called to the poilce station for an interview, the same story is given again and they quiz me on the contents of shampoo and antiseptic bottles they also took along with the ghb and dmt liquid. They charge me and let me go.<br />Another year on and a letter arrives telling me I am to be prosecuted for production of a controlled substance (Class A) and possesion of another (class C).<br />6 months later I get a court date, go to court, do not offer a plea and find myself on bail (which this post no doubt breaks :p)<br />another year on and here we are, the prosecution are STILL waiting on forensic details about how much DMT was actually in the solution (the amout in crystallised form was almost nothing).<br />So 3.5 years so far and no end in sight, the wheels of justice grind very fine indeed!<br />In the meantime this has cost the state tens of thousands of pounds (police OT, Forensics Lawyers),&nbsp; given me fairly serious anxiety problems and done precisely nothing to take drugs off the street. Drug policy in action!<br />In summary, don&#039;t buy acetone or methanol except in person, it seems they may be enough to get you busted :p a better message is for gods sake clear out your old extractions after each one! leaving nothing stewing even overnight (those pesky dawn raids will catch em), simple evaporation/recrystallisation is the only safe thing as it can be claimed that you are purifying sreet bought drugs thus landing you with a possession rap rather than production, if you hide the extraction material outside they can&#039;t prove otherwise.<br /><br />Take care out there people!<br /><br />PS I second Vlad1m1r&#039;s view of the police....for the most part they are not too bright, as one confided to me &quot;we only catch the stupid ones&quot;<br />

Apparently the chemical company I bought from had tipped them off , some magical line had been crossed (I bought almost exclusively heptane and petroleum ether) and I was now in imminent danger of blowing something up (if anyone knows what this supposed combination is that could make an explosive I&#039;d&nbsp; be interested to hear it!). So house full (literally) of police and they come across my cupboard of glassware (Im an chemist-in-training) and then my DMT extraction experiments! <br />As it happened I had given up on them a year ago but kept them around meaning to get the last of it out at some point. The only uspide to this royal screw up on my part was that I had smoked the last actual DMT crystals a couple of weeks previously. <br />Spun them some cock and bull story about dual solvent recrystallisation practise on unknown powder from my shady, drug filled past (backed up by salt crystals ect in my fridge - recystallisation is actually pretty fun whatever the material in question).<br />Plods saw cupboard full of chemicals and refused to touch them in case they exploded -&nbsp; thats a quote. Called in a scientist to remove the highly hazardous white spirits and so forth after he asked me what I was doing.

(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58)<br /><br />As far as I can see you can be convicted of possession drugs three or indeed thirty years after the offence was committed... You might be able to argue that after a certain passage of time a Witness is unreliable.<br /><br />Certainly we have had cases where people have been convicted after a number of years. DNA evidence put this child molester behind bars here in the UK 30 years after committing the crime:<br /><br />http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/crime/paedophile-jailed-through-30-year-old-dna-evidence-1-4389835<br /><br />V.<br />

				There is no statute of limitations in the UK for criminal matters. 3.5 years is a long time but it obviously is not a priority for them.

				First ever encounter with the police, was smoking in a pretty much empty place with a few mates when i was 14. LE just came over and told us to put it away and walked of with that.suppose not all of them are bad aha 8)<br />A more serious one, was on road with 2oz of good quality coke, was going to make a shit load of money (Biggest order I&#039;d had back then). When some snake fucked me over, had a cop try bust me near where we were were meeting. Managed to get away from them (Pretty surprised that there were only 2 of them though ???) and managed to get the coke to him in the end.<br /><br />Story is, there all fucking retards,<br />Locker.
