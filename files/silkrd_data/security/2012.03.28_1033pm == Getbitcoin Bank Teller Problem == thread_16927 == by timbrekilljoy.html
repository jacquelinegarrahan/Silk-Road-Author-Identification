				So, I was depositing to a bank for getbitcoin and the teller asked me for id.&nbsp; I said i didn&#039;t have any id and then they requested by name and address.&nbsp; I didnt know what to do so i just sai &quot;no&quot; and left the bank.&nbsp; Thinking back, this probably raised more suspicion than it was worth.&nbsp; What should i do next time they ask me for id?&nbsp; now im paranoid.&nbsp;

				Next time, stay calm and ask why they need your id. Tell them you are never asked an id when depositing into an account. <br /><br />Hold your ground.<br /><br />Never let them see you sweat, even when it&#039;s 100 degrees out. <br /><br />

				For starters, never write on a well known drug board who you use to buy bitcoins in person. Don&#039;t make it easy for informants and willingly hand over your info to all the one&#039;s probably lurking here :)<br /><br />There&#039;s no problems with buying bitcoins, it&#039;s not illegal and it&#039;s common for some banks to ask for ID. You are just giving a legit company money, they won&#039;t know where your coins end up. Bank has no clue what you are doing just you are depositing to an account. They ask for ID because of fraud, some people deposit money from ebay sales then show up later and claim they were duped and try to get it back. Some banks have ID no matter what policy, others don&#039;t care at all unless over $900<br /><br />Give them ID, buy the coins, then send them to a different address, then send them to here.&nbsp; You will be fine. 100% guarantee<br /><br />Though you were probably flagged for being completely shady while in the bank. I wouldn&#039;t go back.

				Sounds fishy considering some of the self admitted problems they are having with one specific bank, sure hope it hasn&#039;t carried over to the other bank they use.&nbsp; Thankfully I have found an alternative means of quickly and securely getting my coin.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a secret it only takes a bit to walk from my bank to another and make the deposit and bingo they are in my account in an instant.&nbsp; Best of luck but in the future remain calm and ask why this is needed to move on.

				I would protest mildly and then leave to go elsewhere.&nbsp; Tell them its an anonymous deposit.&nbsp; If they dont like it then on you go.<br /><br />When I have done it I was asked if I had an account with them.&nbsp; I said no and and that was that.
