				Hey so I finally got bitcoins or tried to...i went to bitinstant and did cash deposit moneygram to btc address, i put in my sr address but when i filled out the form it said that it was going to use coinapult even though i didn&#039;t select that. whatever, so i created a temp email and went to wally world. i did the zip zap payment, and have received confirmation in my new email acct, however i didn&#039;t receive anything from coinapult and i don&#039;t have the btc in my sr wallet. this just happened so i&#039;m trying to be patient but am nervous i threw out my money...any similar experiences/advice?

				If you deposited straight into your SR account then you won&#039;t instantly see any coins.&nbsp; For me, it takes around four hours from the time I transfer into my SR wallet to the time I actually can see/use them.

				update: i made a dumb mistake and put a 5 instead of S in the btc address so they never got sent, bitinstant is fixing the problem for me but can they identify sr as the destination (ie are my funds safe to use)?

				Bro Coinpault is just something used when sending it to your SR account... Thats the way i do it everytime. I highlight my SR account copy and then paste it into where it should go on bitinstant.. Then i go to somewhere with moneygram and i pay. Within a hour 2 at the most there on SR and ready to use.. Last week i added some and hour later i was putting in a order.. Coinpault is just apart of the process .. Now you have to send the coins from where ever u have them to SR account..

				I would personally never trust most Wally World employees in my area further than I could throw them. I&#039;ve never used those moneygram forms, but I expect they could somehow screw &#039;em up (lol...they would find a way).

				I use this every time.. it has worked flawlessly every time too.<br /><br />Sometimes you get the bitchy old lady who asks what zip zap is, but i just say its to put money into an online account.&nbsp; Not lying&nbsp; 8)

				yeah, the transaction woulda been fine but me messing up the btc address messed it up. i contacted bitinstant support with the right btc address (my sr wallet), will they flag this or should my coins be ok to spend?

				you will be fine to spend your coins. once they hit your sr wallet, they are all tumbled together so you shouldnt have anything to worry about.
