				intersango&nbsp; claim to have had their metro account FROZEN for dodgy transcations apparently <br />theres many complaints already on bitcointalk forum that they might be bankrupt / insolvent ,i would <br />withdraw everyting&nbsp; i could off them rite now ,you can always put it back in if this is a false alarm <br /><br />if they go under you will probably lose the lot with no claim back<br />

				I will add myself to the by now very long list of people whose money has disappeared down into the black hole of Intersango.<br /><br />There are various rumours going around ranging from Intersango having made bets (and lost) with other peoples money and are now insolvent, to Intersango having thier account frozen due to funds being implicated in illegal activity. Whatever the case is there is a big list of people who have had their $€£&#039;$ and/or Bitcoins vanish thru Intersango, yet their is no warning of this on the Intersango website and an unaware punter is still invited to deposit funds into their Intersango account. This in itself is very murky practice.<br /><br />I would advise anyone to keep the fuck away from Intersango.

				Ive got faith in intersango. They have had problems in the past before and no one really knew what was going on, all kinds of things were being said then before long it was running again and everything was fine. I suspect it will be the same, the fact every one is running around panicking doesnt make me think anything. I mean I pulled all my shit out obviously, be crazy not to. Did send some real money, not much some where a week ago and it hasnt arrived yet. I pray that every thing works out, and people go back to loving them. Bits have been going up, so if you got bits sitting there it isnt hurting, yet. I hope that the inter people make loads of money doing what they do coz then its likely to carry on. <br /><br />Its a fucker alright, but come on inter you can pull through.

				Shit Intersango died? <br /><br />Who do people in the UK use now. Somebody needs to set up the global bitcoin hawalla network or something, no more banks. Accepting cash deposits in UK is next to impossible without an insane amount of regulations and compliance/scrutiny.

				I&#039;m in the same boat, deposited through dwolla like I always did and its been stuck in pending_review since wednesday. Support was of little to no help, I&#039;m pissed, I really can&#039;t lose that money. <br /><br />I had already gone through this once and it was cleared up in 2 or 3 days, but goddam, AGAIN?! <br /><br />Oh and the admin is going on &quot;leave&quot; today, the 26th I mean. Support said it should be all set before he takes off, but I&#039;m still sittin here with my dick in my hand.<br /><br />Fuck me.

				Popping in just to say that I made my first experience with Intersango this week and it went pretty smooth. Bank account transfer (not from the UK) and then buying BTCs without a problem. Plus, the staff answered my questions in a timely manner. So as far as I&#039;m concerned, I will be doing business with them again.
