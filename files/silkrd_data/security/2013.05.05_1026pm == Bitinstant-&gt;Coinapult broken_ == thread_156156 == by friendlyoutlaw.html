				I&#039;ve been waiting on a deposit made through Bitinstant (delivered via coinapult) all day long now. I&#039;m aware of the concerns about bitinstant, although they have continued to be reliable for me.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve gotten notification that my transaction was complete and deposited to coinapult, but I&#039;ve not received an email from coinapult with the URL required to retrieve my coins. <br /><br />The emails from bitinstant used to include this URL, but they seem to no longer include this information.<br /><br />Is anybody else having this problem? I&#039;m sure it will be made right, but the question is, how long will I have to wait and how much effort will I have to exude to get my bitcoins?

				Just out of curiosity what concerns are there about bitinstant? I used them just yesterday to deposit some coins and my transaction went through in less than 30 min. If there&#039;s been problems I&#039;d like to be educated about them so I can keep an eye out.

				People have said that bitinstant is not always working. I personally have never tried it and not sure i trust it but many people here use it from what I can tell. <br /><br />I wonder are the people having problems trying to &quot;wash&quot; their coins. <br /><br />Are people doing direct bitinstant to SR wallet address having no problems at all, flawless transactions ?<br /><br />

				Friendlyoutlaw,<br />I would suggest u just send your coins st8t to SR ADDRESS when u use bitinstant..<br /><br />ITS NEVER ONCE FAILED ME.. I dont know about the other options but st8t to address always worked.. Wait now that i thiink with coinpolt involved u are sending st8t to address, its been almost 3 mnths since i used them, so im a little rusty.. <br /><br />But Iv been considering BS TRADERS as well.. just in case, But they will only be for my 600+ add

Its no need .<br /><br />Almost everyone i know sends their coins right to SR.. There is nothing wrong with sending to one of your other wallets, If i put 800 dollars into bitcoins, no i wont send all that to SR, I&#039;ll send the whole amount to a safe secure e wallet, and then send a few hundred here as needed. Another tip i can give is, When you add money to SR nothing is wrong with a xtra 100 or something, but go ahead and pick out and have your shipping cart ready, PGP keys on your key chain and send the amount of money u need to cover whatever order(s) your doing. No need to have 2grand just sitting here as you peddle around the road for days shopping come,sarch,add money BUY get off... Repeat process.<br /><br />Also if your not someone who hardly every gets mail except for bills,Gamer mags,porn whatever, its not smart to all of a sudden have 1 to 2 weeks worth of priority mail coming in, small town like mine really could care less, but it raises a eye brow other places. Lucky for me I have worked part time from home for a long time, an always orderd stuff ff the net years before SR so thank god nothing out thee ordinary with me..<br /><br />Except when i have packs come from AUS, But good thing is, its not a vendor and a care package is always sent, so its all good.. Try to keep your orders domestic, NO CUSTOMS SO MUCH BETTER! I was ordering from india for a while and even though neve lost a pack its still weird when INDIA,NETHERLANDS,ITALY,POLAND letters show up.. I have done it but wont anymore except for my AUS care packs, cause not only do i get really neat goodies from DOWN UNDER MATES, i get 30mg original oc;s..... where i get 50 bucks for easy i mainly let them for for 40, but a friend made me realize the risk im taking, and they cant be got, which is very true..<br /><br />Sorry it was a littl log just trying to help ;D

				I made a bitinstant deposit to my SR account yesterday, and blockchain shows that the deposit was sent around 6pm yesterday, but I have yet to see the money actually show up in my SR account. I assume it&#039;s still in the SR tumblers, but how long do they typically stay there? This is taking an unusually long time compared to past deposits which usually pop up in about 4 hours.
