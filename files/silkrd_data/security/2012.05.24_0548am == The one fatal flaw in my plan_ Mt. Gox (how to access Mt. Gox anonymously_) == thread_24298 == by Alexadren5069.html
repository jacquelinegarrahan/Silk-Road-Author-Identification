				Hello, all. I plan on making my first purchase from SR soon. My plan as it sits is to use Aurum Xchange-&gt;Mt Gox-&gt;Instawallet-&gt;SR.<br />The reason I&#039;m taking the bank account route is because I do not live close enough to a bank branch that BitInstant/TrustCash accepts. (small town)<br /><br />Anyways, the only issue I&#039;m really worried about is accessing Mt. Gox through clearnet. (since they flag tor &amp; proxy users). I can&#039;t go to a public library and use a computer there because it requires you to be a member (again, I live in a small town) The only time I&#039;d be on clearnet would be to send my USD from Mt Gox to an already set-up (through Tor) instawallet. Is this a fatal flaw? Do you recommend a different plan of action? <br /><br />Thanks to anybody who can tell me if I&#039;m just being paranoid, or if I need to figure a different way to do this.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />TL;DR: How can I access Mt. Gox anonymously without using Tor?

				Are MoneyPak cards available in your area, i.e., is there a Walmart? If so, I think it&#039;s simpler to buy one with cash and swap it for BTC with BTCpal or another BTC vendor.

				Get a VPN from an anonymous provider (which accepts bitcoins for payment). Then rent your own VPS server from a different ISP who also accepts bitcoins for payment. (google is your friend, there are plenty around).<br /><br />Install an anonymous proxy on your own server (eg squid on debian).<br /><br />To connect to MtGox you then connect to the VPN (some providers even make it possible to connect to the VPN over tor), and then you use your own highly anonymous proxy in your web browser to point to their website.<br /><br />Your proxy won&#039;t be on their lists, since it&#039;s your own server and IP. You can set it up so it doesnt keep logs. Even if it somehow gets tracked, it goes to a VPN which also doesn&#039;t have any details about you. 2 levels of abstraction and warrants that will be needed. Make sure they&#039;re all on different continents and makes it even harder for LE. And if you established the VPN connection over Tor, well then good luck Mr LE.<br /><br />Setting all the above up is quite technical though - especially configuring a server and squid, although there are guides online they are not always perfect.

I took a Seconf Life (SL) account and bought L$. I then had one AV pay another AV (Not connected and only logged into the second account through a local wifi hotspot) set up a virwox account for the second AV and transferred the L$ into the virwox exchange. Then sold them on the BTC/SLL market and transferred the BTC out to my wallet.<br /><br />So it was more along the lines of<br /><br />Bank --&gt; SL AV1 --&gt; SL AV2 --&gt; virwox --&gt; bitcoin Wallet<br /><br />It worked for me, Next thing I am working on is how to get money out of BTC with out raising red flags, requiring reporting, and at the best rate possible.
