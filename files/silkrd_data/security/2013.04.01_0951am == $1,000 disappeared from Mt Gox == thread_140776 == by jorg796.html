				$1,000 has disappeared from my Mt Gox account.<br />It says &quot;withdrawal to bank account - Error&quot;<br /><br />How can there just be an error, and if there was, the money should be reversed.<br />I have a feeling Mt Gox has scammed me?<br />I had $300 in there and as the value of the bitcoin rose, it has grown to $1,150.<br /><br />Has anybody else had this problem?<br />I have contacted Mt Gox and am waiting to hear back from them.

				Did you have your money in bit coins or dollars.<br />Because if you had money in there in dollars, just because the bitcoins went up, doesnt mean your dollars do too.<br /><br />I highly doubt a big company is scamming you, its probably mistake or a misunderstanding, im sure they will clarify when you hear back from them

I have seen other people have had similar problems with this, and then when contacting Mt Gox support have had difficulties getting the funds back.<br />Bitcoin exchanges know that a lot of bitcoins are obtained from illegal sources and therefore if people are having trouble accessing their funds, they may not question it because it was obtained illegally and are worried about this. I am not worried about this.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying they do this, but I would not rule it out. Money doesn&#039;t just disappear. Big banks across the world have thieving employees - There is no reason a bitcoin exchange wouldn&#039;t do the same.<br />Anyway, I will update this when I hear back from Mt Gox.
