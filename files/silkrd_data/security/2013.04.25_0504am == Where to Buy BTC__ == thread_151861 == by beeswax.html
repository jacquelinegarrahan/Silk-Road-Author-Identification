				Ok so I used Bitme.com for a while until they stopped working. Then I used Bitfloor.com and now the bank has closed their account. I checked out Bitcopia.com and the bank has also closed their account.&nbsp; It looks like the banks are attacking the companies that allow cash deposit for bitcoin??? Does anyone know of any good sites to purchase BTC via cash deposit to a bank branch that is still working??

				I&#039;ve heard good things about Blue Sky Traders http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />But I&#039;ve never used them myself so I can&#039;t comment, I don&#039;t really understand their website because there is no indication of how much you should expect to pay per coin. <br /><br /><br />The Feds are almost certainly attacking the bitcoin exchanges that offer anonymous options, which is exactly what I&#039;ve been afraid they would do. I really hope this sorts itself out in the coming months because BST seems to be our last option at the moment.

				You could buy bitcoins locally on localbitcoins.com. You could buy moneypak cards, and sell them to Sugar Mama for bitcoins. You could sell something in demand in exchange for bitcoins on #bitcoin-otc. Here&#039;s a list of more methods you can use to get bitcoins:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151666
