				Nothing really to say anyways, DPR made some serious opsec mistakes and got busted.<br />There&#039;s plenty of other sites around, or you can make your own small .onion site it&#039;s dead simple if you just want a contact page and list of what you have to offer.<br /><br />

				It would be dead simple to make your own SR.<br />Seriously any competent developer can do this using mod_lisp, python, clojure, scala.<br />Securing the server is not impossible. It&#039;s also not impossible to reverse proxy traffic through a pf filter to double inspect packets, and run Snort on them looking for attack signatures. It&#039;s not hard to restrict privilege, run SELinux enforcing or go through /bin and rip out shit you don&#039;t need which could be exploited. It&#039;s not hard to find and rent the servers in Ukraine or Azerbaijan. <br /><br />The hard part is running it with enough discipline to not fuck up and slip on your opsec. That means renting a safe house(s) and moving around to new one&#039;s on a regular basis. Staying off the radar and living an insane life of 24/7 tradecraft while trying to keep up with the LE anti privacy arms race. It&#039;s too difficult for one person to manage with this many users, instead it would be better to simply run the escrow. Put up a .onion that handles escrow and PGP contracts. That&#039;s all DPR was doing anyways, he was selling security through escrow. <br /><br />Afterwards throw up a basic forum and let anybody who wants to sell on it for free. Advertise your escrow service like the russians do on carding forums. This is much safer, and has much less attack surface to worry about than a highly centralized market leaking data everywhere.

				Oops, forgot.<br /><br />Also, make your escrow a bitcoin tumbler/laundry. <br />If you build rep in the game, then EVERYBODY will start using it for escrow + laundry. <br /><br />You could even run it with 3 well known dealers who can be used to review disputes and vote on them so it&#039;s not just you running it with claims of corruption or favoring one dealer over another. <br /><br />The forum you set up could be running homomorphic encryption tied to the users password, so in the event of seizure the feds won&#039;t get everything. Just the people logged in at the time.<br />
