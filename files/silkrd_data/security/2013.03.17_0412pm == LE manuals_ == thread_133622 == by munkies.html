				Is there any info on the deep web about specific ways LE tracks drug dealers? Like official manuals used by police academies? Also I would like to learn more about their interogation methods. I&#039;ve never had any problems with LE, but I want to be prepared for the day (which I hope never comes) when I will. I want to understand how they operate so I can be one step ahead of them and have ways to say if they&#039;re on to me.

				you can usually find stuff with the right keywords on google, and throwing in .pdf<br /><br />the more you search the more interesting things you find. If it is academic read citations, a lot is from LE agencies though. <br /><br />if you find anything interesting post in in this sub forum with an [intel] tag<br /><br />has been a while since I last searched for some LE docs, seems they are getting a little bit better at keeping their shit internal but there will always be unintentional leaks when they throw shit on the internet or it is widely disseminated even if it has FOUO stamped on it.

				As a former LEO, I can tell you that most of the stuff published in manuals is really boring shit.&nbsp; The best in-service trainings I ever attended were not about manuals, but about experiences.<br /><br />Police methodology is governed by two factors: experience (what has worked for your department or for other departments or is a nationally recognized method) and law.&nbsp; All law is public knowledge;&nbsp; the more you learn about the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th amendments, and what Supreme Court decisions have shaped legal understanding of them, the better able you&#039;ll be to resist police searches and interrogations, and if you become a defendant, you&#039;ll better understand your rights after arrest.<br /><br />As for experience, well, police learn by doing.&nbsp; When they get lucky and some innovative officer in Florida pulls over a guy for speeding, smells pot, and finds 6 kilos of weed stashed in the craziest places, well that becomes part of national police training on interdiction methods of finding hidden pot in vehicles.&nbsp; Most cops know (okay, to be fair, let&#039;s say that many cops think) that if you don&#039;t take care of your car, then you probably have other things fucked up about your life.&nbsp; So, you might find the drug dog circling your car after you&#039;ve been pulled over for a blown headlight.&nbsp; Drug interdiction is the biggest financial industry in law enforcement today.&nbsp; So, if some guy in Arizona gets busted because of a specific method that you&#039;re using now, be certain that cops in your local jurisdiction are being briefed on it within the next 30-60 days.&nbsp; You might want to change tactics.<br /><br />What else can I tell you that&#039;s worth a damn?&nbsp; Oh, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Just that cops learn from criminals.&nbsp; They&#039;re reading this thread.&nbsp; The SR is a step ahead of them, and they *hate* that with a capital *hate*.&nbsp;

				Anybody downloading files through Tor needs to either read them on a machine that&#039;s not on any network, or follow my virtual machine tutorial in my sig.

This is like a special container or sandbox where you can stick any kind of file, even ones with viruses, and it won&#039;t affect your real machine. Digital equivalent of a glass jar for your bugs. It&#039;s not 100% perfect, but it&#039;s a long way preferable to opening files you download which were linked to on a drug forum.<br /><br />If you want to do something to improve things, I suggest you checksum each file and put the result next to each filename in your post on SRF. That way if the file is modified by LE agents this can be discovered by people checking the checksum. However your readers using a virtual machine to read files is still preferable since anybody can be a LE agent. The only issue is whether your readers are tech enough to grasp the purpose of the checksum, so... you can upload pdfs to file sharing websites which display the file as a webpage. Then nobody is downloading a file and delivering an exploit is extremely difficult if you visit that page using Tor with JavaScript turned off. Just images and text, no actionable dynamic content.<br /><br />-- Agent Pine

				LE Manuals?<br /><br />LE is a dynamic enterprise... much like anyone on SR should be... dynamic. NOT STATIC.<br /><br />Tactics change, so do manuals... If you learn the court cases... read the &quot;Discovery&quot;... You&#039;ll get a very good idea about methods. FOIA is your friend.

They are constantly having to react to what is going on, and every time someone comes up with something to defeat them, and so on. Anyway just look at the black markets moving billions every year.

				Heres a link to a thread i read awhile back called The Art of Smuggling. I think a lot of his sources for this were from police journals or one article in particular<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12208.0<br /><br />Either way its an interesting read

				LE manuals are a lot like criminal wikis.&nbsp; They were old when they were written, and used up 6 months after they were posted.&nbsp; There are few actual strategies in them, and the ones that are there are rarely used anymore.&nbsp; I attended a DEA co-sponsored training that was AWESOME.&nbsp; We made crack.&nbsp; There was no manual.&nbsp; It was all power point, networking, videos, and training exercises.&nbsp; If you read a manual and think you know something, you&#039;re giving yourself a sense of false assurance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cops, on the other hand, often work under the false assumption that they are one step ahead of criminals.&nbsp; That&#039;s because most of the ones they catch are the really dumb ones.&nbsp; In my LE days, we called the jail the revolving door.&nbsp; We were always catching the same people, generally, for the same things, generally.&nbsp; There are legions of criminals for whom, when they are finally caught (if), it will be their first offense.&nbsp; The Road is an excellent example, but by no means the only one.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a manual to be careful, keep away from doing dumb things, drive cautiously, and be an otherwise law-abiding citizen.&nbsp; Do that, and you&#039;ll never be a blip on the radar of a badge.
