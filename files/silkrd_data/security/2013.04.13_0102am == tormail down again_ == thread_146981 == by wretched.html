				OR we could do both at the same time like walking and chewing gun. tormail had been around and has built trust, but it would be nice to have hidden service back ups when they are down and trust isn&#039;t to much an issue because we are all using pgp for all emails right?

				Ah, well if you&#039;re emailing someone on clearnet, that&#039;s a different problem.<br /><br />A clearnet email provider over Tor should work. Gmail is a pain in the ass, Yahoo Mail doesn&#039;t provide SSL support except during login, cyber-rights.net appears to have a self-signed certificate. I still recommend safe-mail.net.

				They are all equally safe as long as you use Tor and PGP. There&#039;s no reason to trust Tormail more than the others, as Tormail could just as easily be an LE honeypot, and quite frankly your security should never depend on the good will of third party administrators. You should assume they are all malicious.<br />
