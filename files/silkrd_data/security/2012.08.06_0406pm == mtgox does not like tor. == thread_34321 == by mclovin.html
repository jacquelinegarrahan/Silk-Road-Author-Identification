				Just do a google search for &quot;VPN providers&quot;. Or you can just use wifi, preferably one open to the public and away from cameras. Just make sure you search for &quot;changing MAC address&quot; to learn how to keep your network adapter from giving away its unique address.

				Spoof your mac address and go to the nearest Starbucks or McDonalds and do it there.

				Better yet, don&#039;t use Mt. Gox. There are other options, even for people outside of the US.

				If you&#039;re in the UK, I&#039;d probably go with Valdimir. He&#039;s got good ratings and his services are as anonymous as you can get. Because he&#039;s a person, not a bank, he doesn&#039;t have to report or record transactions, so there&#039;s no record of you buying Bitcoins (which in itself isn&#039;t illegal, but it&#039;s best to have no record of buying the number one currency used to buy drugs online).

Just use bitinstant&#039;s direct to bitcoin address. It&#039;s as fast and convenient as you can get.

I accidentally made a mtgox acct before I knew it was not good to make one at home.&nbsp; I have not done anything with it other than make the account though. All info would be helpful, I need to get some BTC loaded first thing tomorrow morning thanks man.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Ever since when did bitinstant offer desposit &gt;&gt; btc address? No doubt! About the only problem I can see are btc fluctuations. It doesn&#039;t look like bitinstant allows you to set btc price limits like getbitcoin did.
