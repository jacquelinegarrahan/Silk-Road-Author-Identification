				July 12, 2012<br />Beckley man charged after drugs intercepted in mail<br /><br />By Kara Van Pelt Register-Herald Reporter<br /><br />A Beckley man is facing felony drug charges after a federal postal inspector and the Charleston Police Department intercepted a package mailed from Detroit, Mich., containing thousands of dollars worth of narcotics, Beckley Police report.<br /><br />Reginald Turner, 54, of Beckley was charged with possession with intent to deliver after a search warrant executed on his home at 302 Wildwood Ave. uncovered prescription medication and marijuana, Detective Lt. Gant Montgomery said.<br /><br />The search warrant was executed after Turner accepted the package, which postal inspector Josh Mehall had tipped Charleston Police to its suspicious nature and illegal contents after a federal search warrant for the package was obtained, Montgomery said.<br /><br />The package contained 89 hydrocodone pills, and after Turner accepted the package at his home, a subsequent search warrant of the home resulted in the seizure of 20 Opana — oxymorphone — tablets, several ounces of marijuana and an undisclosed amount of cash, police added.<br /><br />Beckley Police were contacted because an ongoing investigation into Turner was already being conducted. Police believe Turner has received previous packages containing illegal drugs through the U.S. Postal Service on a monthly basis, which Montgomery said is becoming a more prevalent issue in the war against drugs.<br /><br />Turner maintains past drug convictions, Montgomery added, and additional charges are possible against other residents at the home. Turner was remanded to Southern Regional Jail where he was awaiting arraignment.<br /><br />Cpls. Bryan Atterson and Will Reynolds, U.S. Marshall Shane Osgood, Parole Officers Dave Toiler and Doug Workman, and Charleston Police Detective Justin Hackney assisted in the execution of the search warrant, Montgomery said.<br /><br />Anyone with additional information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact Beckley Police at 304-256-1708 or Crime Stoppers at 304-255-7867.<br />

				This is why you keep a clean house. Especially when you know you are receiving a shipment, the &quot;I didn&#039;t know what was in the package&quot; excuse doesn&#039;t work when you have several ounces, pills and stacks of cash in the house when they search it.&nbsp; ???

				&quot;Turner accepted the package at his home&quot; and if his house was clean he could have left it sitting on the table unopened and when they raided told them it wasn&#039;t his, he had no idea of the contents and to get fucked and call his lawyer. It is good to have a cool off period for a big shipment. Just leave it sitting there unopened and wait just to make sure, as sometimes they will wait for you to open it or a friend to come by and pick it up so they can maximize the damage that they do. Waiting the extra day won&#039;t kill you unless you are fiending! :o

				The big point for me was that he already had a supply of other drugs in his home.....harder to claim that you are only taking drugs for personal use, with this evidence present......this is the point between getting a warning/suspended sentence and getting some serious jail time in a court of law......the lesson of this tale is to= CLEAN HOUSE ALWAYS!!!

				Wow, that sucks.&nbsp; It was domestic too so apparently they&#039;d been watching him for awhile for various reasons.<br /><br />Also, he had have priors and seemed to be getting a package or more of stuff every month.<br /><br />Wonder what it was with the packaging that raised red flags.

				The article doesn&#039;t mention SR at all.<br /><br />And I think that maybe it wasn&#039;t pills in the package that tipped off the postal inspector.&nbsp; It was a domestically shipped package which most on here would consider fairly safe with good odds of being delivered without issue.<br /><br />More than anything, it seems that it was due to the guy having prior drug convictions, investigations on him already underway, and packages being sent to him on a monthly basis (maybe the constant stream of packages were always from the same place/area as well?).

				As the article stated, the postal inspector was the beginning of em gettin popped. Either constant deliveries to where something was suspicious - i.e. name changes often, constant bad or faulty returns... it got handed to the inspector for something. Then the rest followed suit. And if the person did know about sr (either party), they wouldn&#039;t have done wrong what they did. Hopefully.

				So, what do you do if you have had orders with a vendor who&#039;s been busted.&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about Dude here.<br />If the vendor is in NL, and I live on another continent, should I be concerned?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I ordered, and it was shipped 4-Jul.&nbsp; On around 10-July she/he stopped his listings, talking about uncertainty of deliveries because of TNT in NL having industrial disputes which are affecting deliveries out of NL (for some reason).<br /><br />SR just refunded me today, 13-July, saying he/she has been busted..&nbsp; I assume the only risk is if he/she left address labels lying around?&nbsp; I&#039;m not concerned at all about the delivery, it was only worth $40 (approx), what I&#039;m worried about is my address details.<br /><br />My understanding is that as soon as they ship, address info is automatically deleted from SR.&nbsp; Is that true??

Do you know how easy it is to stop mail? I know cops are in and out with various cases, not just drugs but that is a big issue. <br /><br />As users buying drugs off this site we should be careful and clean up as much as we can. As for leaving a package 24 hr, good advice but I buy small and its envelopes so if they come I go to the drop and collect them.<br /><br />IF cops ever get a warrent to search your home for drugs they will go through with a fine toothcomb and usually a sniffer dog. The cops NEED anything to justify the visit so really will find most of the stashes you think are safe inside. They will take furniture apart. Tear mattresses. They can cause thousands of damage and if they find nothing they pay for that damage. If they find a roach, you pay. <br /><br />You really need to be clean, its a good habit plus I have children around often so I take it seriously. I will not be the man rushing a kid to hospital because some careless dick left half an E on the sofa. I smoke in the garden now I have constructed the Reds Hideout which is a basic shelter. <br /><br />So being clean is the way to be be. Do NOT get sloppy and have shit all over the place. Sober up, clean up, take a rain check because that is life regardless. Dangers exist and best cover your ass because its lazy ass users that get sloppy who give the police easy busts with no chance of denying it.<br /><br />Seems Mr Busted was likely a career dealer/user who can revist his buddies in the pen. <br /><br />In the UK many dealers do not give a shit about jail. That said, nobody wants it but its hardly Alcatrez. <br /><br />Mexico has jails ran by the cartel affiliated gangs! Guards on the outside with guns and grenades, prisoners inside a kind of holiday camp with music, girlfriends and wives staying over and of course, anything you need is there for sale. Funny thing is that jail is safe as fuck. Safer and more easy than USA jails which are ran for profit which is why 0.1 grams might land you in jail. Its an industry. Nobody walks out rehabilitated. Many walk out and NEVER want to go back. <br /><br />USA is like Hitlers Germany in some ways.<br /><br />Hitlers used Nazi Speed and rounded up junkies to be liquidated. <br /><br />Welcome to humanity.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Its only a ride!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />(sure, its Bill Hick, R.I.P) rave in perpetuity.

I will not be the man rushing a kid to hospital because some careless dick left half an E on the sofa. I smoke in the garden now I have constructed the Reds Hideout which is a basic shelter. <br /><br />So being clean is the way to be be. Do NOT get sloppy and have shit all over the place. Sober up, clean up, take a rain check because that is life regardless. Dangers exist and best cover your ass because its lazy ass users that get sloppy who give the police easy busts with no chance of denying it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well Said!! Before I had kids I was a cop&#039;s wet dream with multiple types of contraband laying all over the house and people hanging out doing all manner of shit. With the kids now and all the stuff I don&#039;t want to lose, I keep everything off property and just take a joint with me when I go to feed the chickens and the chickens will eat the roaches ;)&nbsp; Bonus: it&#039;s nice to live in a safe clean house, not being paranoid all the time, and no worries of the little ones telling a teacher about daddy&#039;s funny friends/cigarettes laying about the house ;D
