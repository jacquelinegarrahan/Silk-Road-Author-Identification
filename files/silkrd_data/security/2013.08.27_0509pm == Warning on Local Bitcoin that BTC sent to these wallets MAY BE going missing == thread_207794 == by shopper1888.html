				This was put up on the Local bitcoin forum by a mod or someone that works there.<br /><br />Warning regarding Silk Road transactions today<br /><br />Several of our users have approached us today that their bitcoin transactions to Silk Road wallets have not been successful. In some cases there is blockchain information available showing that immediately after the bitcoins arrived to the receiving service, the bitcoins where transferred forward to somewhere else, indicating that the receiving service might have been hacked. However, we do not have details yet.<br /><br />I recommend everybody to extremely careful with the transactions of this kind. If possible send a smaller amount first to see if it goes through before sending the full transaction sum.<br /><br />Warning, this is on a www addy (clearnet?)<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/forums/#!/

				^ Lol yeah, I also assumed he was watching the btc tumbler in action. Whenever I checked my transactions on the blockchain, coins were always moved from the original receiving address shortly after a deposit. I wouldn&#039;t say it happened &quot;immediately&quot; though...
