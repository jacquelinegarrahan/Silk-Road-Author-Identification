				I have been trying to buy some bitcoins since last weekend. At first, the site was giving that error about their partners. Then, after I told it what I wanted to do, it took me to a login page and said I could skip it by completing the transaction as a guest, but had no link to do so. Now the front page has nothing listed for destination. This is really getting irritating. Does anyone know what they&#039;re doing? There doesn&#039;t seem to be any other viable options for buying a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoins.

				I&#039;m getting the same message that their partner is down. Bummer. I was hoping to get some coins ASAP. I&#039;m checking out Localbitcoins but I don&#039;t really understand it. It looks like I can buy some with a bank transfer but then I&#039;d have to shuffle them. When you buy with cash do you actually have to meet in person? I&#039;m for sure not doing that. I&#039;m off to do some reading.<br /><br />Edit: Tried registering on localbitcoins and I got an error. Can you not run the site through Tor? I can try on clearnet I suppose.

				I read in another thread last week (when having the same issue) that people are logging into BI and creating an account with their info, or other people&#039;s info, and then having no issues gettin their coin. <br /><br />I definitely do not want my address on any kinda registered list, no matter how many times I tumble my coinage, so I tried this with an ex&#039;s info.&nbsp; But they send you an email and have you verify your identity answering some in depth questions.&nbsp; And I know my ex pretty well, but they ask some in depth questions (what month was your oldest brother born....).&nbsp; <br />So, I wasn&#039;t able to verify, and thus, still no coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;And Blue Sky traders wants a minimum of $400 for new traders with them......<br />What&#039;s a girl to do???

				I used localbitcoins dot com. found someone who does cash deposits. A little more expensive,(not much fees but sellers sell more than market value) but more anonymous. bypass mtgox all together.

				Hello--<br /><br />Some people are having problems with BI and other are not. I hope you re in the are not category. I also heard that they were going to stop taking USA payments for 2 weeks.<br /><br />I have no idea id any of this is true. But if it turns out to be and any of you need 800+ in btc. I charge no fee. I cover the Fee WU charges...and I sell the coin at the exact price it is when we are ready to Finnish the deal.<br /><br />So for example you send me $850. WU charges you $76. So that is $926.00. When we are done..I will send you $926 in btc to SR. And the other good news is that if the rate on SR is 111.12 then you will get 111.12&nbsp; as the&nbsp; conversion rate. And we do that as the last moment of the deal..so if the btc changed in the 30 min this takes,,,no worries as you will get the best rate and&nbsp; you will have at least 15 min to shop at that rate....before it changes. <br /><br />Also I have been a vendor for&nbsp; over 1 year...and been doing this over a year...Both have nothing but 5/5 feedback. Both on the item(selling btc for cash) and on my vendor profile) <br /><br /><br />So please check it&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a901074cb3<br /><br /><br />And if you have any questions..message me on SR..THANKS for your time.

				Let&#039;s look at the current landscape for US patrons trying to buy bitcoins. Our current options have been pretty much limited to Bitinstant and Localbitcoins. If I were LE I would narrow down the range of options to buy Bitcoins and ideally would have only one option which it would make it easier to profile people. <br /><br />And here we go waiting for the fucking retarded comment &quot;Bitcoins are legal comment from some idiot&quot;. Well guess what buddy you&#039;re on this forum which means... figure it out.<br /><br />All bullshit aside... it&#039;s still easy to use fake info for Bitinstant. I can easily go online and find thousands of peoples info but what if I deposit $500 into Bitinstant and it catches the fact I forged the transaction. It&#039;s kinda hard to scam a system where you don&#039;t know the safeguards. I do suggest that ppl that are still using Bitinstant to post their experiences here so from that info we can come to some sort of a guess of what safeguards they may have behind the scenes. It could be coincidence that some people are getting fucked and other aren&#039;t but I don&#039;t believe in coincidences and neither should you when it comes to your freedom. <br /><br />Bottom line: we need more ways to buy bitcoins.

				Narrow down the range to buy Bitcoin. I respectfully disagree with you there&#039;s more BC trading co out than ever before. Localbitcoin Campbx, Verviox (don&#039;t use them), www.coinbrokers.org to name a few and there are a lot more than that.<br /><br />Bottom line be very careful though for each legit company selling Bitcoin there is also one that is scamming.<br /><br />The above listed are legit.

				I was able to get through and place an order earlier today, after failing a few times at the test questions. And then I got to thinking, with all the problems BI has been having lately, as well as all the new verification stuff, why should I go through with the transaction? <br /><br />I went to localbitcoins and found an online trader. The fees were certainly higher than with BI (spent $180 and got $157 in coin), but I literally just placed my order here on SR just a mere 2 hours after leaving the bank. For me it was worth the extra dough to make my order quickly, and to be assured that I was able to keep my money. Between BST and localbitcoins, BI will never see another dime from me.

				Ok found it ..it was actually 45% not 60% like I said:<br /><br />CLEARNET: http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/04/study-45-percent-of-bitcoin-exchanges-end-up-closing/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A study of the Bitcoin exchange industry has found that 45 percent of exchanges fail, taking their users&#039; money with them. Those that survive are the ones that handle the most traffic—but they are also the exchanges that suffer the greatest number of cyber attacks.<br /><br />Computer scientists Tyler Moore (from the Southern Methodist University, Dallas) and Nicolas Christin (of Carnegie Mellon University) found 40 exchanges on the Web that offered a service changing bitcoins into other fiat currencies or back again. Of those 40, 18 have gone out of business—13 closing without warning, and five closing after suffering security breaches that forced them to close. Four other exchanges have suffered serious attacks but remain open.<br /><br />One of those is Mt Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, with Moore and Christin stating that at its peak it handles more than 40,000 Bitcoin transactions a day, compared to a mean average of 1,716. It has been the victim of a huge number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks over the past month during the peak of the Bitcoin bubble (and its subsequent bursting—though the price now appears to be rising again). Its latest statement, dealing with the attack it suffered on April 21, is long and comprehensive, seeking to assuage the fears of Bitcoin users who feel that Mt. Gox is becoming a weak chain in Bitcoin&#039;s infrastructure.<br /><br />The sheer quantity of trade done on Mt. Gox has made it an extremely attractive target for hackers wishing to manipulate the wider Bitcoin price. That is the paradox that Moore and Christin discovered in their analysis—that an exchange needs to maintain a transaction volume above a certain level to survive, but becoming large enough to survive also makes a hack of that exchange worthwhile for cyber attackers.<br /><br />The study said: &quot;Exchanges handling 275 Bitcoins&#039; worth of transactions each day have a 20 percent chance of being breached, compared to a 70 percent chance for exchanges processing daily transactions worth 5570 Bitcoins.&quot; Moore and Christin estimate that the median lifespan of any Bitcoin exchange is 381 days, with a 29.9 percent chance that a new exchange will close within a year of opening.<br /><br />An extra risk for customers is losing their money from exchanges closing. Of the 18 closed exchanges, there was evidence that only six reimbursed their customers. Five did not, while there was not evidence enough to make a judgement regarding the remaining seven.<br /><br />However, they found that there was still a significant degree of randomness behind the success or failures of many exchanges, which could be down to whether an exchange has a good or bad reputation (something they didn&#039;t control for). For instance, they point to Vircurex as an exchange that has had low transaction volumes since opening in 2011, and which suffered a large attack in 2013, but which has remained open regardless. Bitfloor, which lost money in one of the first high-profile Bitcoin break-ins, was not so lucky.<br /><br />Also, a sample size of only 40 exchanges does means that some of their other results didn&#039;t reach statistical significance—it&#039;s going to take more time, as Bitcoin matures as a currency, for exchanges to appear and be eligible as samples for a more thorough analysis.<br /><br />The paper, &quot;Beware the Middleman: Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin-Exchange Risk,&quot; has been published online and was presented at the 17th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference.<br /><br />This story originally appeared on Wired UK.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Everyone keeps ranting and raving about localbitcoins... I&#039;m just not seeing it.<br /><br />There&#039;s no in person sellers within a reasonable distance to me. And the closest ones charge ridiculous fuckton amounts. So that option is out.<br /><br />So then there&#039;s the online sellers. Out of the mere 25-30 listings that are ever available at one time, you&#039;re lucky to find maybe one or two that are actually viable. I don&#039;t know what OKpay is or how Dwolla works, so those are out. Okay, since there&#039;s rarely ever Greendot Moneypak listings available, guess the obvious choice is a BoA deposit. But they charge like fucking, $95/BTC when they&#039;re actually around 67 per bitcoin. And then you have to hope the amount you want fits their range. But fuck it, it seems like it&#039;s really the only choice at this point. I just decided to take a chance with a BTC for MoneyPak vendor on SR, but even then you&#039;ll probably get raped by fees.<br /><br />The whole Bitinstant thing is pretty creepy, and it&#039;s totally fucked how they already know your info, so no fake identities. Never encountered that before. But the way I see it, if you&#039;ve ever purchased BTC with your real info before, you&#039;re already on someones list.

				Also keep in mind other virtual currencies such as Litecoins may be easier to buy than you can convert those to Bitcoins. I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s just a thought I had. Maybe someone else can share there knowledge of Litecoins or I might just look it up.

				Not really...Coinbase received $5 million in funding from VC couple months back. You have the Winkledick twins trying to get a 20 Million Bitcoin Trust going. I doubt Bitcoin is going anywhere it&#039;s just in a weird period at the moment. VC are not all jumping on the Bitcoin wagon but a few are so I wouldn&#039;t dismiss Bitcoin altogether.&nbsp; ;)

				Remeber when the internet came out in the 90&#039;s and the masses dismissed it like &#039;Oh it&#039;s just for watching porn&#039;. Well here we are 13 yrs later and things have evolved. I think the same thing is going on with Bitcoins atm. I really like what Coinbase is doing though. Without the proper people representing Bitcoins it will just be viewed as a way to by drugs anonymously online but it&#039;s so much more than that. <br /><br />The problem is getting these old VC to understand what Bitcoins are. The CEO of Spotify said &#039;what&#039;s a Bitcoin&#039; when asked at a trade show. Like really dude? Warren Buffets take on Bitcoins was &#039;we have $98 billion in our portfolio and not one Bitcoin in there so what does that tell you?&#039;.. well Mr.Buffet it tells me your old and your going to die soon and Bitcoin will probably be a mature and legit currency that is used all over the world without the need for banks, currency exchanges, and old greedy men like you that scam the financial system.<br /><br />Thx for +1 btw ..back at ya&nbsp; 8)

				I have accounts at bitinstant, verified using other people info, and I still cannot use them.&nbsp; It says 500 transaction limit 2000 daily limit but when I try to put in new transaction it will not let me, when I emailed them they said <br />&quot;We’ve recently launched improved security measures related to our Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer processes. We have temporarily limited transactions in some locations, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Your home state is one of these locations.<br /><br />Read more here: http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2013/6/30/website-update.html<br /><br />We do not have an exact timeframe for reactivation of locations, but we will make an announcement via our website, blog, Facebook page and Twitter account as we enable new locations. We will also send you a notification email when we begin to process transactions for your state.&quot;<br /><br />So you are lucky to be in a state that still works.&nbsp; the 5% fee doesnt sound bad compared to the premium being charged on localbitcoins<br />

				I also verified a few identities to use with them, and now it appears they won&#039;t process order at all. Localbitcoins doesn&#039;t seem to have any viable sellers, and I don&#039;t consider $90 per coin to be viable. Might as well buy weed locally then. I&#039;ll be hoping that coin prices go up or something and localbitcoin lists more sellers willing to use BoA deposits at a fair price.

They&#039;re a business and businesses main goal is to make money. I encourage everyone not to panic and things well level out soon. In the meantime it does suck but I suggest head over to some Bitcoin forums see if you can find some legit Bitcoin sellers though that got rep.

Even if you successfully verify your ID at the end by answering the 3 questions you still won&#039;t get to setup a money-gram/walmart local deposit because you will get a site maintenance message which I find fishy because if you are not a quest/valid member the site actually does take you to the page to buy coins but not when you actually worked hard to Verify your ID...Bitinstant is really making me anger to the point I would honestly round them all up shoot them like pigs they want to be.

				I was able to run my transaction yesterday morning around 11AM EST but it never went through and I get an infinite loop of MtGox Transfer Errors and then I got a Bitinstant Transaction Fail. I know bitinstant can fix this because the failed transaction part happened to me before but now NOTHING. I hope they fix this by tomorrow....instead of working on this Roger Ver is busy doing Karate or something. He knows people are mad and he&#039;s active on his facebook this is ridiculous and Im getting real close to message him on his personal facebook and ask him what&#039;s going on
