				If you purchased BTCs a week or so ago and saved them, you now have 1 and 1/3rd times your money back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone bank on the drop?&nbsp; I know I would have if I had gotten paid. It&#039;s kind of obvious BTC isn&#039;t going anywhere atm.&nbsp; <br />

				I lost a few quid because I changed my BTC for USD assuming that the price would continue its downward trend. I still think it will fall over the next few months unless something big happens, but my predictions have never made me any money in the past so you&#039;re probably best off ignoring my opinion.

				Nope, I&#039;m just another one of the newbs shaking our fists at the sky for being a single digit amount of days behind on getting up to speed and pulling funds together. Congrats to all the newly wealthy individuals out there or even those who have just broken even, I&#039;m sure that as the value was falling your stomachs were tied up in some knots. May you continue to flourish and may the ideology of cryptocurrency continue to soar to its potential!
