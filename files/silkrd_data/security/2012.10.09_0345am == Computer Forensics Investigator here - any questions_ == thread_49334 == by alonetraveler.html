				I&#039;ve been in the Information Security and Digital Forensics fields for almost 15 years, both federal and private sectors. I would like to know what burning questions or concerns you have when someone like me has access to your computers and/or mobile devices.<br /><br />The first piece of advice I can give you is to always do your business off of a live, linux-based CD. For those in the US, buy a laptop off of Craigslist, remove the hard drive and exclusively use boot CDs. You will also want to regularly change the MAC address of the network device you are using. Also, NEVER use a wifi hotspot that has cameras. In the offhand chance that we are able to track down your activities to a specific place, we have and will use the business&#039;s security cameras to identify you if you&#039;re a suspect.

Apologies if this is a dumb question... I&#039;m old, dammit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The most legitimately secure disk encryption software we come across is TrueCrypt. Some major commercial encryption software or devices have been decrypted by us once the federal government gets involved. I can&#039;t say what specific commercial brands or products without compromising my identity, but you can trust TrueCrypt. As for keeping it safe, it depends on how secure your encryption password key is. General rule is more than 16 characters (alpha-numeric with some symbols sprinkled in) will keep it safe. Anything else beyond that is almost pointless padding unless you have great memory. TrueCrypt covers this extensively but you&#039;ll also want plausible deniability, so learn to keep your sensitive data trim. I say this because it&#039;s very obvious to find an encrypted volume if we see large blocks of random data. We can tell the difference from day to day data randomly placed on the drive to actual randomized/encrypted data. There are also several algorithms available to us to determine if an encrypted volume exists on the hard drive once we seize it. From that point on it&#039;s a matter from building dictionary lists from the seized drive and brute-forcing the volume or from leaning heavily on you for it.

Even with the advent of rainbow cracking and tuned-up GPU machines, using a diceware&#039;d phrase is fairly secure. Although they are not truly entropic algorithms, researchers are closing in fast on the algorithms Diceware and other similar services use. This is where a lot of people screw up, they get lazy and are not vigilant with their passphrases. Also, if you&#039;re in the U.S., keep your mouth SHUT. If you&#039;re in a place where no such option exists, plausible deniability and lean data is your best bet.

Their ignorance was exceeded only by their arrogance.&nbsp; Apparently there is a caste system of sorts in IACIS, with with the sworn officers being the Brahmins, and the civilians being the Dalits (Untouchables). Some of the sworn officers literally slagged their civilian colleagues, looking down their noses with complete disdain much as a Brahim would look down their nose at a Dalit.&nbsp; Those forensic examiners working for the defense came in for even greater scorn than their civilian colleagues. <br /><br />Speaking of caste systems, it is my understanding that, in the United States, in order to do work for the government, you have to be a member of a particular professional association, membership in which is denied to those who do work for the defense.&nbsp; Given that there is a plethora of government forensics work, and to some degree, a dearth of defense work, there is a strong incentive to avoid working for the defense, as this can severely affect one&#039;s prospects (not to mention income).&nbsp; My understanding is that it is therefore difficult to find competent forensics people willing to work for the defense.&nbsp; Is this correct? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=49334.msg509974#msg509974">Quote from: alonetraveler on October 09, 2012, 04:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And yes, the U.S. does archive a crazy amount of info on you.

The procedure you&#039;re describing is the same one employed by the U.S. Secret Service, i.e. using Access Data&#039;s Distributed Network Attack (DNA).&nbsp; A 9 or 10 word Diceware passphrase makes that all superfluous, from a technical point of view. Your only option then is to sweat it out of the suspect, and if they&#039;re smart they&#039;ll listen to their lawyer and keep their mouth shut. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I concede both points to you. Even with the advent of rainbow cracking and tuned-up GPU machines, using a diceware&#039;d phrase is fairly secure. Although they are not truly entropic algorithms, researchers are closing in fast on the algorithms Diceware and other similar services use. This is where a lot of people screw up, they get lazy and are not vigilant with their passphrases. Also, if you&#039;re in the U.S., keep your mouth SHUT.

One repeats the process until the desired passphrase length/strength is achieved.&nbsp; There is no algorithm to crack -- because the word order is based on a random physical process, it cannot be predicted (assuming the dice are fair, of course.) <br />See: http://www.diceware.com/ <br /><br />Here is a short excerpt from the Diceware word list:<br /><br />&nbsp;16655 clause<br />&nbsp;16656 claw<br />&nbsp;16661 clay<br />&nbsp;16662 clean<br />&nbsp;16663 clear<br />&nbsp;16664 cleat<br />&nbsp;16665 cleft<br />&nbsp;16666 clerk<br />&nbsp;21111 cliche<br />&nbsp;21112 click<br />&nbsp;21113 cliff<br />&nbsp;21114 climb<br />&nbsp;21115 clime<br />&nbsp;21116 cling<br />&nbsp;21121 clink<br />&nbsp;21122 clint<br />&nbsp;21123 clio<br />&nbsp;21124 clip<br />&nbsp;21125 clive<br />&nbsp;21126 cloak<br />&nbsp;21131 clock<br /><br />The complete list contains 7776 short English words, abbreviations and easy-to-remember character strings. The average length of each word is about 4.2 characters. The biggest words are six characters long. The list is based on a longer word list posted to the Internet news group sci.crypt by Peter Kwangjun Suk. An alternative list, edited by Alan Beale, contains fewer Americanisms and obscure words. And there are lists for several other languages. You can also download the Diceware word list in PDF format or in PostScript format.<br /><br />

				alonetraveller, thanks so much for sharing your knowledge.<br /><br />I currently run a clean version of TAILS with no persistence off a bootable USB. <br />Q. What are the advantages to running off a CD instead (I would assume it&#039;s not writable?)? I do prefer the USB as it&#039;s small, fits in my pocket and has no information on it...just TAILS<br /><br />I store all my sensitive information on a micro-sd card, encrypted within a hidden Truecrypt volume and with a bunch of homosexual midget porn on the non-hidden portion. I am under the imp[ression this gives me plausible deniability...and worst comes to worst if I was in a country where the rubber-hose is more popular than the rubbery arms of justice...I can eat it! :)<br />Q. Assuming I have a strong passphrase (And I do: entropy = 210)...and assuming I was going down for pretty serious crimes, (let&#039;s say plotting to blow up the parliment guy fawkes style)...how long would a forensic team spend attempting to brute-force until they gave up?

				I think SSD is perfectly safe as long as you encrypt it before putting any sensitive information on it. Throwing a laptop in the river, pouring bleach on it or smashing it up will not help you in the event of a raid. Your best option is to power it off, and have it fully encrypted.

				Is EnCase still the software of choice for LE digital forensics?

Is there a point to using EFS in Windows XP/7 if the partition is already encrypted? Assuming the password to the account that the EFS keys were derived from is strong and all basic exploits are closed (syskey, SAM file copies) is this windows file encryption still reasonably secure? EFS encrypted files can be a huge pain in the ass to get at via remote network exploits, at least in my experience. It&#039;s not a solution but IMO it&#039;s an easily implemented deterrent.

				Still here, just checking in and looks like I have to set aside some time to answer these questions. One thing I will answer now in this brief moment is that DBAN/eraser/any other disk wiping software is great if you have a small storage device and regularly use it, otherwise when they knock on that door and you start running DBAN on your hard drive, it will take several hours to completely wipe it even if it&#039;s just a single pass run. The mantra is KEEP YOUR DATA LEAN.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on hiatus, work related, but will be back to answer these questions. As for as how to best do your business anonymously, there are several ways to do so that have already been thoroughly discussed in different threads. I will re-read those threads to address some concerns, mainly that we have been able to recover info from the swap space on Liberte drives recently if we catch it in time. Anything that writes to a disk is risky and is why I advocate for a boot CD, which is read-only.

				Buy an old DirectTV or DishNetwork satellite dish of eBay or Craigslist and build yourself a nice Bi-Quad Wifi antenna! Attach this antenna to a compatible wireless adapter. Now using your HDDless laptop.... boot your Linux LiveCD! (Try BackTrack5). If you aren&#039;t familiar or comfortable with using the terminal, or are just new to network exploitation, then just open up Gerix.&nbsp; Proceed to crack all the WEP networks available! WPA2 requires a bit more work, but with your awesome looooooonnnnggggg range antenna you can just switch between networks as you please ;) Try adjusting the dish and monitor how a networks signal strength increases or degrades based on line of sight / distance factors. This will give you a good idea as to the general direction where these networks located, but without knowing the build quality of your Bi-Quad it is difficult to give a decent estimate on the farthest distance some of the networks may be. Your ideal / safest targets should be mid range to low strength (not too low that you cant connect!) signals since they will tend be quite a bit farther away,. Make sure to alter the dish to see if its just a network that had poor signal strength due to being an outlier of antennas line of sight. Remember, they most likely will not notice you utilizing their network connection (especially if they are still using WEP ;) ), but you don&#039;t want to be in a visible range of the location as to not bring unnecessary attention to your sketchy looking satellite dish.

				Wiping an entire partition will get rid of all data, including slack space.<br /><br />The only time slack comes into play is during a free space wipe. Not all disk wiping software allows you to clear slack space during a free space wipe. Eraser is a good freeware app that takes care of that.

				Okay so it has been expressed quite a few times that the best way to protect yourself would be to run a laptop with no hard drive and run liberte linux off of a liveCD. It has been further suggested that enabling a bios password and disabling &quot;quick&quot; boot could be beneficial as well.<br /><br />Therefore, we can conclude that if you are not running the configuration listed above then you are not protecting yourself as much as you could possibly be.

				Ok, so after reading this thread I decided I needed a laptop with no HD and liberte on a USB stick with read only (which makes it identical to a bootable read only cd, right?).<br /><br />Then I went to a website to check my stealth. Well, the ip address is not mine ofcourse, but it sais that the tcp and udp are not stealthed. <br /><br />Does this matter? I can not find a firewall within liberte which seems weird to me since it&#039;s supposed to be ultra stealthy? Wouldn&#039;t my mac address be tracable this way?<br />Then again I am confused as to why this is better, since using the tor network alone is supposed to be anonymous. Or is it pseudo anonymous? If so, why?<br /><br /><br />I also wonder about when computer forensics investigators are called in to do a job. What is the minimum of criminal activity a person had to commit before they get watched? And if they do get watched, what gets watched? Browsing history? Email like gmail or hotmail? Facebook? Entered mobile numbers and phones?<br />Is it possible to get caught with something by using tor on windows, if so, how? And how is it when one uses different identities all the time?<br /><br />I guess a person like yourself, aloneinthedark, would be a perfect candidate to be a target for spreading information?

Either that or they simply use the recovery CD generated during the encryption process as the boot loader for that partition. As long as one has encrypted backups of the CD, it&#039;s not a bad idea.

K was referring to FDE partitions that have the boot loader--the only unencrypted area of the partition--stored on a separate medium so that the FDE drive cannot easily be distinguished from random data.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using a CD you will have to encrypt the hard drive first (as a regular partition not a system partition) and then copy truecrypt or whatever software onto the new CD along with any keys. Then you can access the drive from said Live CD and it will look like random data to everyone else (no boot loaders). Personally, I recommend taking out the hard drive completely and just using a flash drive instead of a CD to host the confidential OS. That way you can permanently store a nice amount of data and not worry about your adversary trying to modify a few bits on the HDD in an attempt to &quot;mark&quot; you.

				You mention knowing when a USB key is used, which I know is possible in windows, but is this true of linux as well? Is this also true when booting from a USB?

				Data recovery firms have no problem restoring HDDs that survived fires, 100ft drops, and deliberate attempts at smashing them. Not one has been able to recover an overwritten file from a modern hard drive, and I&#039;m talking a single overwrite of zeros. As of today, a single-pass overwrite of any kind (the more random the better) is enough to effectively destroy data on a HDD.&nbsp; The whole &quot;Gutmann wipe&quot; and the 7-pass &quot;DoD standard&quot; are overkill to the extreme.<br /><br />Can the NSA recover such info in their hypothetical secret labs? Maybe, but that goes beyond the scope of most criminal investigations. Not only is the standard of proof too high for dirty, pieced-together data to be accepted at trail, but the government is not going to use secret technology to go after internet drug dealers, unless of course there are some extraordinary circumstances involved. By the time it gets that serious, the person being watched has wayyy more shit to worry about than the recovery of overwritten files.

				Few questions here :)<br /><br />If you restore your computer back to factory settings is all your old data really removed?<br /><br />Where should we make the live USB? If we do it on our machine afterwards it can be seen<br />that one was made right? <br /><br />And can you see how many times windows was installed on a harddrive?<br /><br />And when having a harddrive in your computer, but plug in your USB exclusively when booting<br />is that a problem?<br /><br />Thank you for your time!<br /><br /><br />

This is deleted when you shutdown the lappy and all your browsing history goes with it. The fact that there is no hard drive makes it safer because there is nothing for programs to save any info to. the opeerating system is all on the CD\USB Stick
