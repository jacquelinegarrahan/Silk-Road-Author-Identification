Silk Road allowed parties to communicate anonymously for the purchase and sale of illegal goods, to include the purchase of illegal narcotics, in addition to using Bitcoin. Customers could also leave feedback about their purchase experience in a system similar to other online sellers.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They know!!!<br /><br /><br />Oh wait...who cares? ???

				Good looking opi&nbsp; :D i for one am stocking enough drugs for a year just in case something fishy happens. i have saved about 200 super dosed ecstasy pills, 3gs of premium h, and 10gs of ketamine. these are the drugs that i can never find on the street. i have been paranoid, so i spend most of my extra money from my paycheck, and all of the money from selling my suboxone perscription. in a couple months i will have enough stock to chill for a while&nbsp; :P

				No one is questioning the legitimacy of this report?<br /><br />It&#039;s just assumed to be a real report because someone posted it on a message board?<br /><br />Some of the people here are pretty gullible.

				It&#039;s a news story, not just a post on a forum, so it must be true!
