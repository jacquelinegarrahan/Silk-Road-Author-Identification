				Just curiou what everyone uses for GPG encryption in Linux? I am in the process of making the transition, and I can&#039;t seem to find a good route to go. What I&#039;d like to do is import my existing keys from GPA if possible. Ubuntu has a GPA app, but it&#039;s completely fucking useless! You get an error immediately after opening it.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help!!!

				Ya export all your keys to a txt file and send it to yourself via email or some other private route.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you are use to linux, I suggest looking into running TAILS. It has a built in PGP program that is very easy to use and just runs off a text editor and clipboard. Saves all your keys locally in a persistant encrypted partition on the USB. It forces all connections to run through Tor. Its a very usefull OS, clears memory after use and VERY VERY EASY TO PULL THE PLUG!! is that not what we all want/need in the end?<br /><br />&nbsp;*bang bang* POLICE SEARCH WARRANT!&nbsp; .......easy as pulling out a usb stick and smashing the SD card and bye bye evidence :-) <br /><br />&nbsp;(DPR why didn&#039;t you use this method ya fackin putz)

				Thank you for the reply! I am not good with Linux, and had planned to get Ubuntu all set, and then do the TAILS. It sounds like I should do it the other way around though, and that&#039;s what I&#039;ll do.<br /><br />Thanks!

I just exported all my keys into a normal text file and emailed it to myself and imported through tails integrated pgp software (very stable and works wonders). I set it up so all my keys and any future keys or files I create from the pgp applett are stored in the encypted partition that Tails creates for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve never dove to deep into linux based OS&#039;s before, this is actually fairly new to me but I enjoy it much more than any mac or windows based OS......hell since I found tails I haven&#039;t loaded any native windows OS other than to check my real email from time to time, I enjoy it that much.

Open Seahorse, click file, import, and type the name of the keys you want.<br /><br />The apps I use depend on the OS. In TAILS, I&#039;d use Seahorse for keys and Gedit to encrypt text (like an address).<br /><br />Since you&#039;re using Ubuntu, however, I&#039;d say download Geany and Geany plug-ins (they&#039;re separate) from the Software Center. For whatever reason, the Gedit version included with Ubuntu doesn&#039;t have an encrypt option. Linux has built-in GPG support, so you don&#039;t need GPA.<br /><br />Seahorse is your default key manager and is already installed. It&#039;s now called &quot;Passwords and Keys.&quot; Hit the dash button and search for passwords and you&#039;ll find it.<br /><br />To encrypt in Geany, look in the tools menu. It&#039;s called GeanyPG and will be available after you download the Geany plug-ins.<br /><br />PS You can encrypt/decrypt files in the terminal (you can do key creation/management there too, but it&#039;s still done using seahorse<br /><br />Here&#039;s the encrypt command for Ubuntu:<br />gpg --encrypt -r KEYID FILENAME.txt<br />or<br />gpg -o FILENAME.gpg --encrypt -r KEYID FILENAME.txt<br /><br />The first one works fine. -r is the recipient. In the longer format -o is the output file, but it works without. You&#039;d use the first if you wanted it saved in another location:<br />gpg -o /home/user/Downloads/FILENAME.gpg -r ~/Docuuments<br /><br />Key ID is the name on the public key<br /><br />If you&#039;re not in the directory that contains the file, you&#039;ll need to specify the full path to the file. It&#039;s easier just to use cd to change directories. If not, it would be:<br />gpg --encrypt -r KEYID /home/user/Documents/Filename.txt <br /><br />The first one works fine. -r is the recipient. In the longer format -o is the output file, but it works without.<br /><br />Decrypt:<br />gpg --decrypt FILENAME.gpg<br /><br />Verify signature:<br />gpg --verify FILENAME.sig<br /><br />Export:<br />gpg --export -a KEY-ID&nbsp; publickey.asc<br />The public key will be exported to the terminal. You can copy and paste it.<br /><br />Export keypair (I.e. public+private):<br />gpg -o ~/Documents/myprivategpgkey.gpg -a --export KEYID<br /><br />

Then select GnuPG keys on the left side and click file, export...<br /><br />Or you can use the terminal (I wrote this in my other reply, but here it is again):<br />Public keys in ascii:<br />gpg --export -a KEY-ID&nbsp; publickey.asc<br />The public key will be exported to the terminal. You can copy and paste it into Gedit. Save it as filename.asc, although txt would probably work too.<br /><br />For Key Pairs:<br />gpg -o ~/Documents/myprivategpgkey.gpg -a --export KEYID<br />In this case, the file path should be changed to the directory that you want to save it to, assuming that you have a persistence file. <br /><br />
