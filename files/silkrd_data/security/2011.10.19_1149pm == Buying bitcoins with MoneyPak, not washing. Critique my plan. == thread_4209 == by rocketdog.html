				I&#039;m a newb planning to make my first purchase as soon as SR is back up and steady.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve done so far:<br />1) Installed Tor Browser Bundle on Win XP.<br />2) Installed Bitcoin version 0.4.0-beta. Connects through 127.0.0.1 port 9050. This should torrify it right?<br />3) Registered SR account.<br />4) Registered SR forum account with different user name. <br />5) Registered new Tor-only email account with user name different from previous two steps. <br />6) Installed Gpg4win with GPA front end. Is Kleopatra better?<br /><br />Next steps:<br />7) Buy bitcoins from https://get-bitcoin.com/ with MoneyPak card. Have them sent to the address shown in my Bitcoin application.<br />8) Transfer bitcoins to SR and become criminal mastermind from the safety of my USPS-served mountaintop lair.<br /><br />Additional steps:<br />9) Buy bitcoins from SR seller BTC Buddy with another MoneyPak card. Since I&#039;m new at this, I&#039;ll get to compare the fee overhead of the two methods of bitcoin purchasing and have a backup in case one method fizzles.<br /><br />Critiques? Suggestions? Caveats? Is bitcoin washing really necessary?

				Thank you for posting about this site.<br /><br />With cash, wells-fargo direct deposit option, they can become a replacement for quick cash-btc since exchangebitcoins.com is closing down. Inspite of the 5% fee for purchasing bitcoins and 3% for selling, it&#039;s not a bad site! thanks!

				I placed an order about 12 hours ago for bitcoins priced up to 2.33 USD. That&#039;s low I know from my limited experience but SR was showing a price of $2.25 at the time. About 10 hours ago I placed another for bitcoins at a max price of 2.55 USD.<br /><br />I think next time I&#039;ll set my max price a little higher so as not to be cheap and give them a better chance to fulfill my order. The website says they&#039;ll respond within 24 hours and will not process my order (I used MoneyPak cards) if coins cannot be found at or below my max price.<br /><br />To reiterate, I&#039;m a complete newb at this. I&#039;ll report back after I hear from get-bitcoins.

				https://get-bitcoin.com/ has served me well so far. First order fulfilled in about 19 hours with 5% transaction fee. I had the bitcoins sent directly to my Bitcoin application. When SR is back up, I&#039;ll transfer just a little more than I need to cover my first purchase and then place my order.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the application I downloaded from bitcoin.org is called my wallet. Services like instawallet.org are called eWallets I think. I don&#039;t plan to use the latter.<br /><br />Updates to follow.<br /><br />Update -----------------<br />Second bitcoin order has been fulfilled. Purchase using MoneyPak worked great. Now it&#039;s waiting game to see what happens with SR.

				Hey, I&#039;m doing almost the EXACT same thing your doing, except for washing. And my lair happens to be inside a volcano. I was going to go through Mt. Gox but noticed you needed to send ID in and other shit. I was extremely wary of get-bitcoins due to lack of reviews on the bitcoin forums(non-tor). I wished my bitcoin could have come a day sooner and I could have ordered &gt;.&lt;

				I keep seeing mention of get-bitcoins wells fargo deposit option but I don&#039;t see it on their website. What is the deal, did they remove it or is it a secret method?<br /><br />Do they have any other quick cheap methods since they aren&#039;t accepting moneypak? Moneypak was awesome at 5%.<br />Anyone know any other legit low rate moneypack vendors?

				get-bitcoin has a slightly different setup, than exchangebitcoin did.&nbsp; You don&#039;t &#039;join&#039; their site.&nbsp; You just click on &#039;buy&#039; and give them the amount u want, yer email, and a name.&nbsp; then another page pops up with the info--and it&#039;s emailed to u--this info has account # and shit for their wells fargo accnt.&nbsp; *then* u trot down to WF, deposit, get receipt, make picture and email that u did it...btc in an hr....

				The wells fargo option I think is Bank Wire.&nbsp; When you choose the amount on get-bitcoins and choose bank wire, a confirmation will come up with their wells fargo account number and location.

				<br /><br />No--I mean, maybe, but not the way I did it--do cash, they send u some info, u get the cash, trot down to WF with the cash, fill out deposit slip, and deposit in the Get-btc account.&nbsp; Except for not joining get-bitcoin, it&#039;s exactly the same as the way that exchange-bitcoin did.&nbsp; One other downside: *they* change them into btc for you, at the prevailing rate.&nbsp; You can&#039;t have them &#039;sit&#039; there in dollars until you are ready.<br /><br />Again: easy as pie: decide amount you want, click on &#039;buy&#039; (or just fill out main page, same difference), then it&#039;ll come up &#039;how&#039; you want to deposit...&#039;click&#039; cash, then u will get some account and transaction #s , good for 24 hrs, then u go to WF, deposit, get receipt, go home, send email w/pic of receipt.<br /><br />I&#039;m not speaking from &#039;theory&#039; btw...&nbsp; :)<br />
