				Hey Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m new and still learning the ropes.&nbsp; I placed an order earlier this week and used a fake name with my real address.&nbsp; Do you think I have a good chance of getting the package or is there a good chance it could get lost or delivered elsewhere?<br /><br />Any guidance would be helpful.&nbsp; Thanks.

				Depends what you mean by fake name. A package to sir Scrotty Mcboogerballs may raise a few eyebrows. If you just used a plain old fake name I doubt it&#039;s going to cause a problem.

				It was just a plain old name.&nbsp; They wouldn&#039;t try to deliver it to someone else in the U.S. who potentially could have that name would they?

				You may get the package. However, using a fake name with your address is a red flag. You are better off using your real name.

				It was shipped out Monday morning West Coast time and I still have not received it.&nbsp; Do you think I should be concerned?

				Depends on what country it is coming from, or if its coming from east coast US. USPS has had some pretty big cutbacks lately, I&#039;d say wait until Wednesday before giving it up for loss. If it was an international shipment I&#039;d recommend only doing domestic orders for a while as a security measure.

				I always use a fake name with any of my addresses and I havent had a lost package in 2 years :)<br />The USPS is more competent than most people make them out to be.

				I have other people let me use their addresses. Also, I always try to have product sent with NO signature required (meaning the package should just be left in the mailbox). When the feds seize a package containing drugs they usually attempt what is called a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;. In the event of a controlled delivery they have a conditional warrant that specifies when the package is delivered it must be signed for by someone at the address, thus validating the warrant, and allowing them to execute the warrant ie. kick in your door, search through everything, and make arrests. By not having a signature required it is obvious when a controlled delivery is taking place. If a &quot;post man&quot; insists that the receiver must sign for a package that the receiver knows should not have a signature required it should be immediately obvious what is really going on. To avoid a controlled delivery in a situation like this all the receiver needs to do is deny delivery of the package. Say &quot;that is not my name, I am not expecting a package&quot;. Then the warrant will be void and they can not do anything. I hope this helps a little :)
