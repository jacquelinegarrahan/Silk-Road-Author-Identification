				I agree with what others have said, I don&#039;t think this is LE. If LE really wanted to bust you they can go about it with a lot more tact and stealth. From what I can tell this is just some kid who wants a fake ID.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell to him or anyone like him. People who don&#039;t know what bitcoins are or how to use them shouldn&#039;t be on this site in the first place - ESPECIALLY people who think PAYPAL is a viable alternative.

				Milkwoad do not send money to any other users telling you they will help you get BTC! Also do not listen to the guy saying to use BTKOIN.COM it is a scam, they are all fucking with you because you are new and sound very easy to scam. Just trying to help you out man. I hate it when people scam on here, it degrades the integrity of this community and is just plain fucked up. The truth is that most people here use www.bitinstant.com. Trust nobody kid. I hope you don&#039;t send over $700 to fuckingACE&nbsp; or anybody but bitinstant lol. Otherwise you&#039;re gonna learn the fucking hard way.

				Don&#039;t accept any other payment than bitcoin. The seller acted professionally in refusing business.<br /><br />However you shouldn&#039;t publicly accuse people as being cops, unless you have real reason for suspicion. Milkwoad comes across to me as a newbie buyer, not an undercover cop. But even if he is LE, it doesn&#039;t matter as long as the seller takes decent security precautions.

				Oh my god. This whole thread is absurd. Milk, DO NOT send anyone cash and only go through the Silk Road escrow system. If you send someone cash or anything outside of SR you will be scammed, I guarantee it. Go to BitInstant and do a lot of reading. You are far too naive and uninformed to be doing any of this. It can be a little confusing but the way BitInstant works is actually extremely simple. Just place an order and choose a place to deposit the cash, finalize it, follow the instructions on the slip they give you, make your deposit, and get your coins. I honestly don&#039;t even think you should do this at all, you seem like someone who is about to lose a lot of money.
