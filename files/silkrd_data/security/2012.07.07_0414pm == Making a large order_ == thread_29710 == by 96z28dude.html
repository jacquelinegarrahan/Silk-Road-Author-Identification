				I found a website called chemicals-trade.com and the sell research chemicals specifically 4-MEC which is what I&#039;m interested in. Anyways I ordered 50 grams from them and I got it and the stuff is absolutely awesome and extremely cheap. I was thinking about ordering 500 grams but I am extremely nervous to do so because there has been 1 federal indictment for some guy ordering a KILO from somewhere and he is facing 20 years if he gets convicted. I don&#039;t wanna be that guy haha Should I maybe use TOR to access the website and order? I don&#039;t think that would do much of anything though since I would be paying with pay-pal. I live in the U.S. by the way. Maybe I should just ask the vendor to split the order up in two parts and have him ship 250 grams and another 250 in a separate package? But still if customs opened 1 of them and saw 250 grams of 4-MEC I still think I&#039;d get in trouble haha cuz 250 is a lot. What do you guys think?

				I guess you can order it through paypal but have it shipped to an address that&#039;s not yours. The only time you are in danger is if customs picks it up. You may also talk to them and ask if they are willing to split it into 4 shipments and have them sent to different addresses. This would minimize the danger of the entire shipment getting seized. But definitely don&#039;t have it shipped to your real name and real address. If you have purchased from them before than they should be willing to work with you, hey they are there to make money.

The only reason I order from them is because it&#039;s super ass cheap and I don&#039;t have my SR stuff set up yet. I think I&#039;m just going to set up all the stuff on SR so I can start ordering real mol (if you catch my drift haha) from here. It&#039;s 99999999999% more safe and discreet haha
