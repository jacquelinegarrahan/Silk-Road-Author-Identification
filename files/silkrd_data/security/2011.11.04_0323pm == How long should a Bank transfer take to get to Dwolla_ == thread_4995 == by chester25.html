				So on the 2nd I transferred a few dollars from my bank account to Dwolla, they said it would take 3-5 business days and would most likely clear on the 7th.&nbsp; As I check my online banking statement the bank says the money cleared this morning but when I check&nbsp; Dwolla, nothing?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing patience is the key here but how much longer do I have to wait?

				I bet you will be waiting till the monday the 7th.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think if you click on the pending listing when you are on your dwolla account it will tell you this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The waiting definitely sucks.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can&#039;t wait the 3-5 days try get-bitcoin.com&nbsp;

				The fastest method is bank transfer via Dwolla to Mt Gox. Basically, you log in to your Mt Gox, and &quot;Add funds&quot; via Dwolla deposit. It will ask you to pull from your Dwolla balance or your bank account. You select your bank account. This transfer will take (usually) a total of THREE BUSINESS days to get to Mt Gox and is free. <br /><br />Otherwise, if you transfer from your bank to Dwolla. Then transfer from Dwolla to Mt Gox or elsewhere, you&#039;re looking at at least a week (business days).

				They now will tell you when your funds will be available and it&#039;s pretty much when it will happen. Yes the waiting can suck if you need it now.&nbsp; If you can plan out your needs and give it some time it&#039;s a decent way to go imo.

				Anything to do with dwolla just takes to damn long...to me, it&#039;s just been passed by by other btc exchanges, making dwolla not so vital to the transaction...first exchangebitcoin...then they went under, but now we gave get-bitcoin.com ... for me, they are just way too handy to make using dwolla to put my btc in tradehill or mtgox, just not necessary...don&#039;t need a pc wallet anymore, either, now instawallet so reliable...and fast too...
