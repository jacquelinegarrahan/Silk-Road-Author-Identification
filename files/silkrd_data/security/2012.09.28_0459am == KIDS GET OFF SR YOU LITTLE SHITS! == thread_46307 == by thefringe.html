				Fucking little pricks. It&#039;s dickheads like this, and I bet there are loads more like them, actively using SR, that don&#039;t seem to understand the potential consequences of there actions. Unfortunately, you cant put an old head on young shoulders. To all you youngsters and newbies, please read, read and read some more before using the site so when the time comes, your able to minimize your risk through making an informed and educated decision. If you rush into it, mistakes will be made.&nbsp; :(

				kids, sniff some glue instead. stay off SR until your balls grow long curly hairs and your cock has reached it&#039;s final girth and length size. when your penis has reached it&#039;s final size you may return to SR and buy your little shrooms and weed. until then, fuck off. drugs will stunt your growth. your cock will remain micro, and your height will freeze at 5&#039;1. all that for some cheap highs?<br />

Weed and LSD is a good combo, these guys weren&#039;t selling meth.<br /><br />These aren&#039;t &quot;just dumbass teenagers&quot; or &quot;arrogant idiots&quot;—they&#039;re human beings, and no one deserves to have their growth stunted, be pushed around and told they&#039;re powerless. It doesn&#039;t change all of a sudden when somebody becomes an adult. You have to respect every body.<br /><br />That said, we know nothing of what actually happened. This is a shitty news article, don&#039;t expect much.

				Chill the fuck out! <br /><br />I&#039;m quite new to this, but if you would use your your brain for few seconds you would realize that LE knows how the whole system works better than half of the users on this forum. It&#039;s pure logic, the point is that they can&#039;t really do anything about this. And if you are planning to tell me that ohh, we know about LE but we don&#039;t want any publicity then you are again being stupid.<br /><br />The only reason they got busted is because their parents sold them out so I don&#039;t see how this is affecting the vendors or silkroad.<br /><br />You are being pathetic for telling kids off.

Obviously your still stuck at home with mum and dad, working at McDonalds a couple of hours here and there in between delivering junk mail as you save up to buy a 0.5g of meth. You sound as stupid as those two kids involved. Calling two dumbass teenagers revolutionaries is fucking ridiculous and demonstrates to me a level of intelligence where your IQ would struggle to hit double digits. These arrogant idiots, through there own actions, gave their parents the ammunition they needed to call the Police and once again enshroud SR with this &quot;kid&#039;s are using SR&quot; cloud. I don&#039;t believe drugs have a place in the life of a child, 0-18yrs.&nbsp; &gt;:( If you sneak around&nbsp; with some mates and occasionally sneak a puff of some weed after buying a 50 off a friend or maybe pop a pill at your mate&#039;s 17th birthday party and manage to keep your parents out of the loop, good luck to ya. But to be importing quantities of a variety of drugs to your parents house and selling them is insane. &gt;:(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Keep trying, maybe you&#039;ll hit something eventually. Just the fact that they are using Tor and bitcoins, and are importing weed to me makes them revolutionaries, just like all who use SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just sad their own parents busted them but that&#039;s life, unfortunately.<br /><br />As for your beliefs, guess what, they are just that, yours.&nbsp; Nobody but you gives a fuck about them.&nbsp; If a kid is going to do drugs, weed is going to do no harm to them.&nbsp; Their own parents have just done them more harm than anything else by purposefully putting them into the system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No offense justanotherrandomuser but your beliefs are just that too, just yours. You are arguing like your opinions are automatically right when in fact you just have an opinion so what makes YOU think anyone gives a fuck about what YOU think? I think the guy Wazdo has some valid points although I don&#039;t agree with him/her entirely. For instance, the idea that simply by using SR makes you a revolutionary is, in my eyes, extremely naive. SR is a revolution in black-market commerce, yes but thinking everyone here is part of some sort of movement, nah my friend. Vast majority are just buying drugs and getting high. Speaking for myself I have no revolutionary tendencies at all, I am here to do my job professionally and make a lot of money in the process and I find it annoying when idealistic people like yourself with big ideas and probably very little life experience tries to cast everyone in the same light and label everyone as the same as you. <br /><br />Also, yes, actually ALL drugs do harm to people if used irresponsibly so the idea that &quot;weed does no harm&quot; is incredibly off base. Weed does no harm my ass, it can be just as bad for you as any drug, in fact, I would even go as far to say lot of ways Puff is one of the worst drugs there is. <br /><br />You need a bit of a reality check in my opinion, this isn&#039;t the 60s anymore. I do agree with you though that the parents have fucked them for life but shit happens. It&#039;s hard for me to believe that if the parents did that then the kids wouldn&#039;t have known they would have done something like that in the first place. If you are stupid or ballsy enough to do it anyway then you need to know what you have got yourself into before you embark on such a venture.

				In regards to whether somebody can be considered &quot;a revolutionary&quot; just by using silk road; Everyone here IS part of a revolution, no doubt about that.&nbsp; I personally believe DPR and the successful vendors on here are MAJOR REVOLUTIONARIES.&nbsp; Whether individual buyers are or not, it&#039;s a matter of opinion that nobody is going to agree on.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing I wonder about these kids that got busted.... why the hell did they just not use a drop?&nbsp; I mean, it&#039;s mega easy to wag school on your lunch break to go check the block of flats down the street for your package.&nbsp; Adults more than likely would have greater difficulty doing that, aside from their lunch breaks maybe.&nbsp; Maybe it was just the crappy school I attended.... but I would think you could slip away easier than if you&#039;re an adult with an employer who would notice immediately if you&#039;re gone.&nbsp; Depends on the job/school I guess.<br /><br />I personally never even got into alcohol until 18, weed 22, and only now am I starting to reach my drug peak!&nbsp; While it&#039;s true that using drugs while your brain is still developing could definitely weigh quite heavily in determining your psychological stability and success in the future, remember to put yourself in these kids&#039; shoes for a minute.<br /><br />Sorry, i&#039;m rambling a bit, what I mean to ask is, do you guys honestly think that if you were 16 or 17, and found out about SR, that you would NOT use it?&nbsp; Cmon, you&#039;ve got to be kidding.&nbsp; SR wasn&#039;t around when you were that age, but what if it was?&nbsp; <br />That said, I definitely worry about kids ruining it all for everyone.&nbsp; SR really is only meant for mature people.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be stupid kids! Don&#039;t run around at school and tell your mates, or anyone!&nbsp; Be very very careful if you&#039;re going to use SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s not meant for you, but obviously nobody can stop you using it, please please just be as sensible as you can about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kids, please keep to yourselves about SR, and don&#039;t be foolish if you&#039;re going to use SR.<br />Also, take it easy on the drugs.&nbsp; Just because you have access to things does not mean you&#039;re ready for them.&nbsp; I am so glad I was completely sober throughout my high school years, because now everything i&#039;m getting into is that much more new and exciting, and I know I can handle it.<br /><br />rant over<br /><br />

				RE: the Thread&#039;s title, not so much all the posts and opinions. This is my opinion about &#039;kids&#039; being told to get off SR.<br /><br />This site is like a huge tasty sparkling carrot-like tease for those seeking more than what&#039;s available in your local stores, I guess some people see the carrot and run straight for it.<br /><br />Let&#039;s not flame &#039;kids&#039;, or &#039;noobs&#039; (I fucking hate that word) lets educate and make the info accessible to find out.<br />I know all the info is there now, because I went searching.. surely the site and community is open to all who desire it&#039;s treasures, not just those that have been here a while and have found out how to, you were new here too at some point.<br /><br />I noticed when I first come here, the SR practically glows with all the categories and a lush 3 X 4 grid of pictures showing lots of wonderful things otherwise unavailable to those following state guidelines. That&#039;s one hell of a gift we&#039;ve been given here, and it&#039;s easy to find yourself taking the quickest and possibly unsafe route to it.<br /><br />If you&#039;re young and/or new to this, DON&#039;T GET OFF SR.<br />Take some time and educate yourself to the best, safest and adequately vigilant methods of using site to it&#039;s potential.<br />And then, once you think you&#039;ve got it down to a fine art, question your ways and try to improve them as you go.<br /><br />Im 30 somethings btw, only found out about SR, bitcoins and TOR in July/August 2012 -- TOTAL NOOB! ;) but willing to learn and educate as I go.<br /><br />Keep safe, Keep vigilant, keep learning &amp; improving.

I do think it&#039;s sad that there own parents felt the need to dob them in but if one was to use some common sense, I would put my money on these parents were at the end of there tether and had lost complete control over what they did, where they went or who they were associating with.

The parents did what they thought they had to. If they thought they could of handled it themselves, I&#039;m sure they would of but I&#039;m in no doubt that there were prior underlying problems which were brought to a head by this. Weed can be a fucking dangerous drug, especially the hydro shit, and I&#039;m more than qualified to comment on this since I was addicted to weed. I was that addicted to smoking weed from a bong that my body started to shut down on 8 occasions,&nbsp; putting me in hospital for weeks each time. My body actually started to burn muscle instead of fat for energy and the Doc said to me after I told him I smoke a lot, if I don&#039;t stop smoking I was going to die. That was over 15 yrs ago now and it took 4 sessions with a Hypnotist for me to finally give it up. Haven&#039;t touched it since. Weed for most adults, is nothing much to worry about, but it really shouldn&#039;t be smoked by kids who are still growing and developing, especially today&#039;s hydro with all the chemicals. Adults have a responsibility to give children a good education and the life skills they need so that when there old enough to make there own decisions,&nbsp; you can trust it will be an informed one.&nbsp;

				Stormtrooper420, IMO, teenagers should steer clear of drugs until there 18, an adult by law, and can make there own informed decisions. They have there whole adult life to party on and do as many drugs as they want to. These are important years in a child&#039;s development and it&#039;s nearing the end of their growth cycle. Just cause you as a kid were using SR doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s right. Posting you were &quot;consistantly picking up thousands of dollars worth of MDMA &quot;doesn&#039;t mean shit and shows me you haven&#039;t thought through the possible implications of what you wrote. Younger people might class it as paranoia but a more mature person would say it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry. The drugs did have some affect on you, whether you believe it or not, cause considering you haven&#039;t touched MDMA in 9 months, you still managed to write this &quot; managed to maintain an excellent rep and a name in the respectable name in the scene. &quot;&nbsp; WTF is that? Your right, age is just a number but life experience is something that develops as you mature. A lot of young people these days rarely consider what the consequences of their action might be before it&#039;s too late. They think they know everything and as soon as they become an adult, will never have to learn another thing again. What they don&#039;t realize is you never stop learning throughout life, ever. ;D

				Did I ever say the drugs didnt effect me? no. That is why I stopped cuz I could tell they are effecting me, and guess what I just woke up from sleep cuz I was awake for 30 hours so yeah maybe I did make a typo, you have never made a typo before? Anyone that is under the age of 18 can make as much as an informed decision as someone older.

I know exactly what I did to my body and I know what I am gonna do to my body in the future and I would not be the same person if I didn&#039;t explore my subconscious. So you want all the kids picking up their drugs off the street? You know they will do them anyways, drive to change to an altered state of mind is in every animal. I know I don&#039;t know everything, it just pisses me off when adults pull the &quot;I&#039;m older so I know more&quot; Thats bullshit. Experience is everything but people have different experiences. See its kinda funny how you guys just assume shit about someone you dont even know over the internet like they are a dumbass because they made a typo. People like you guys are the reason why I am never on this shit anymore. So I&#039;ll get off SR like you request and go back to the private forums :D<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

That was using the same poor logic as the person starting this thread. It was an illustration of his/her logic. It&#039;s of course not my opinion.<br /><br />I also never claimed to know everything so don&#039;t put words in my mouth. And no, I&#039;m not angry, your post actually made me laugh out loud. As to whether or not I am immature, that&#039;s hard to say, since the definition of immature is subjective and often relative. However, I couldn&#039;t care less if I am considered mature or immature.

When someone proceeds to write bullshit like this in their post, I&#039;m going to respond and tell them what I think. That is what a forum is for, to express an opinion and discuss it with other forum members. <br /><br />&quot;Anyone that is under the age of 18 can make as much as an informed decision as someone older.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you one day realize the stupidity of those words and just how untrue it is. Anybody who thinks a child is capable of making an informed decision about anything, equal to that of an adult, must have a screw loose!! Kids don&#039;t understand that there are consequences for their actions. By your own admission, the drugs had affected you, resulting in you giving them up. For that, you should be proud of yourself. Realizing there is a problem is the hardest thing to face and you&#039;ve done it. But surely you can see, in hindsight, that taking all that MDMA at such a young age was not the right decision for you?&nbsp; You say &quot;so you want all the kids picking up their drugs off the street,&quot; and to that I say NO. I would prefer it if kids didn&#039;t touch drugs until they reached 18 yrs old and were officially an adult. Kids, if given an opportunity, will try to arrange some gear for a party or alike, but by educating my kids at a young age on the dangers of drugs and just how dangerous they can be and always being available for them for any reason at anytime to talk through what ever &#039;s on their mind. I trust I have given them the opportunity to tell me anything, knowing I would never be upset for them being honest with me. Drugs can do things to the brain and body of kids as they are still growing and developing. Fuck, at 18 they have their whole life ahead of them to do as they please but in some cases, early usage can really derail what was once a promising future. I&#039;ve seen it first hand and it can really you, believe me. Lastly, I&#039;m fed up with the youth of today (the majority) and there attitude towards things, lack of respect towards property and people, especially the elderly, and a severe lack of manners and common courtesy towards others. There are exception to the rule, but this is definitely the case for the majority I&#039;ve come across. If you show people this sort of attitude, family friends and workmates, etc, you will close a lot of doors and limit your opportunities where as people with a polite, courteous and respectful attitude who are prepared to listen and learn from &quot;older&quot; people about certain things, not all things, will give themselves the best chance of achieving their goals and living a life they had only dreamed of.&nbsp; <br />You say &quot;it just pisses me off when adults pull the &quot;I&#039;m older so I know more&quot; Thats bullshit.

				I still consider myself a kid-at-heart. I recognize that despite my years, I know nothing and that never really will change. When I was a teenager, I was a smart kid. Not an Einstein, but sharp enough to know I stood a bit apart from your average person in terms of my ability to learn and adapt.<br /><br />I was also a frustrated kid because most adults - it&#039;s just human nature really - take the stance of &quot;oh you&#039;re young, you can&#039;t possibly understand.&quot; And that is probably the most offensive thing one can say to your average teenager（offensive to that teenager, that is）. Most people of intelligence CAN understand any given situation despite the lack of any direct experience and regardless of age, so to dismiss someone as &quot;just a stupid kid&quot; because they may not have the same number of calendar years under their belt as you do is misguided at best.<br /><br />The only thing the advance of time has given me - aside from wrinkles and debt - is experience. My intelligence is now as it was when I was a teenager. Yes, I&#039;ve learned many things since those days and I think many people would count that as being a bit smarter, however I am no more intelligent now than I was as a teenager. I just have a boatload more experience from which I can draw, and therefore I can make far better decisions.<br /><br />So dismissing or judging someone simply because of a number makes no sense. How many teenagers use SR without any problems? We will never know because we will never hear from them. My guess is the real number would surprise most of us.<br /><br />It&#039;s the morons who leap before looking and land in the Pit of Despair that this thread should have been directed towards. It&#039;s idiots - not necessarily &quot;kids&quot; - who pose the greatest problems.

Your right MaebyFunke and well written in your summary of a young person&#039;s attitude of today. I suppose I can&#039;t get my head around some people&#039;s thoughts about this subject. It&#039;s starting to sink in why the world has changed for the worst from the years when I grew up. For AdmiralSpanky to claim his intelligence is now as it was when he/she was a teenager is incomprehensible to me! All these teenagers stating they get frustrated and offended if an adult would say things like &quot;your too young to possibly understand&quot; is just crazy. There in lies the problem, where teenagers of today&#039;s generation have this mentality of wanting to start at the top, not start at the bottom and work their way up to the top. Certainly been an eye opener for me and thanks again MaebyFunke. :)

Seriously?&nbsp; ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Those who come to Tor for CP are revolutionaries no, but if they were to protest and go out of their way to have it legalized they would :) Not that I agree with it, but at the same time the exact reason drugs were made illegal was by ill-informed opinion. Of course nearly all of us here agree paedophilia is disgusting and we condemn it, we, just as paedophiles do, speak of an opinion although I guess we can give factual evidence as why drugs aren&#039;t bad in itself.<br /><br />As for kids buying drugs - why not? Drugs do little harm when used responsibly. Age isn&#039;t a factor in whether drugs should be used as anyone who takes time to do their research will rarely run into trouble or have side effects they weren&#039;t expecting. Also, many people considered mature in the normal world could be absolute idiots here by not thinking through their actions. Whilst it is true many younger people will struggle to have the same kind of understanding of the seriousness of such a site, it doesn&#039;t mean that they can&#039;t understand or that by being over 18 or 21 you are automatically able to understand.<br /><br />If my kids (which I don&#039;t have any yet, but what I would do in such a case) were caught buying drugs such as the above case, I&#039;d give them a fair choice and understanding of what is happening. Receiving a record for drugs can be extremely negative for some careers, such as my own for example working in a position where police checks are extremely strict and thorough. The best thing is to simply ensure they know the potential consequences of their actions and that if they wanted to stop at any time or encountered a difficult situation, that I&#039;d be there to help them get out of it, but I will be of no assistance in expanding or aiding their operation because even though at the moment I handle drugs myself, I know it is illegal and don&#039;t mind, I&#039;d like my kids to stay out of prison and trouble all together and try to succeed in a legal and successful profession first and do well in school, not to be attracted by money or power at such a young age.<br /><br />I should note that I myself am probably younger than the vast majority of members here. Whilst I&#039;m not 15 or 17 like the kids caught in the article posted, I&#039;m not exactly 30 or 40 years old either. I&#039;ve probably got more brains, professionalism and maturity than half of the 40 somethings on here too and unlike a lot of people in my age range, I do enjoy reading, philosophy, economics, business etc. Personality and their approach to a business model such as the drugs trade, is much more complex than how long they&#039;ve been around and I think we should judge each person by their own merits, both what they say and what we can see between the lines of their writing (often more reliable as they don&#039;t take great efforts to hide some subconscious indicators to their suitability to do business with you).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Molesting Children is bad, Molesting, Raping, or Sexually Assaulting anyone is disgusting and bad. Pedophilia is a phillia (positive feeling or liking) for Paedo (greek for children). Not the nicest thought i know, but something people cant help but are born with just like Homosexuals. I find the thought of sleeping with someone of my sex disgusting and bad, but it doesn&#039;t mean i don&#039;t accept that 10% of the population, including friends of mine enjoy this. Being attracted to someone who is 17 years and 364 days old also gets one branded as a &quot;pedophile&quot; yet this makes them vastly indifferent to the majority of the male Population

Obviously your still stuck at home with mum and dad, working at McDonalds a couple of hours here and there in between delivering junk mail as you save up to buy a 0.5g of meth. You sound as stupid as those two kids involved. Calling two dumbass teenagers revolutionaries is fucking ridiculous and demonstrates to me a level of intelligence where your IQ would struggle to hit double digits. These arrogant idiots, through there own actions, gave their parents the ammunition they needed to call the Police and once again enshroud SR with this &quot;kid&#039;s are using SR&quot; cloud. I don&#039;t believe drugs have a place in the life of a child, 0-18yrs.&nbsp; &gt;:( If you sneak around&nbsp; with some mates and occasionally sneak a puff of some weed after buying a 50 off a friend or maybe pop a pill at your mate&#039;s 17th birthday party and manage to keep your parents out of the loop, good luck to ya. But to be importing quantities of a variety of drugs to your parents house and selling them is insane. &gt;:(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Keep trying, maybe you&#039;ll hit something eventually. Just the fact that they are using Tor and bitcoins, and are importing weed to me makes them revolutionaries, just like all who use SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just sad their own parents busted them but that&#039;s life, unfortunately.<br /><br />As for your beliefs, guess what, they are just that, yours.&nbsp; Nobody but you gives a fuck about them.&nbsp; If a kid is going to do drugs, weed is going to do no harm to them.&nbsp; Their own parents have just done them more harm than anything else by purposefully putting them into the system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Seriously champ, your undoubtedly lacking common sense, a good indication of your age and lack of life experience. Kid&#039;s using this site are NOT REVOLUTIONARIES!!&nbsp; DPR and his team are the true revolutionaries, designing this site and implementing it, with it&#039;s sophisticated security measures onto the Hidden Web for people to use and enjoy. I do think it&#039;s sad that there own parents felt the need to dob them in but if one was to use some common sense, I would put my money on these parents were at the end of there tether and had lost complete control over what they did, where they went or who they were associating with. I&#039;d bet this wasn&#039;t the first time they had been in trouble with either the cops or at school prior to this. <br />My beliefs are my&nbsp; beliefs and I don&#039;t give a fuck what you think of them. The parents did what they thought they had to. If they thought they could of handled it themselves, I&#039;m sure they would of but I&#039;m in no doubt that there were prior underlying problems which were brought to a head by this. Weed can be a fucking dangerous drug, especially the hydro shit, and I&#039;m more than qualified to comment on this since I was addicted to weed. I was that addicted to smoking weed from a bong that my body started to shut down on 8 occasions,&nbsp; putting me in hospital for weeks each time. My body actually started to burn muscle instead of fat for energy and the Doc said to me after I told him I smoke a lot, if I don&#039;t stop smoking I was going to die. That was over 15 yrs ago now and it took 4 sessions with a Hypnotist for me to finally give it up. Haven&#039;t touched it since. Weed for most adults, is nothing much to worry about, but it really shouldn&#039;t be smoked by kids who are still growing and developing, especially today&#039;s hydro with all the chemicals. Adults have a responsibility to give children a good education and the life skills they need so that when there old enough to make there own decisions,&nbsp; you can trust it will be an informed one. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Right and you smoked weed for the first time at what age? Oh you waited til you were 25 did you until your brain was fully developed and then got addicted to weed? I highly doubt it and if you did wait until you were 25 AND THEN got addicted to a substance most people have gotten over by that age let alone addicted to the point there body was shutting down then you have no right to comment on a bunch of &quot;kids&quot; who have thought outside the box when it comes to getting involved in a trade plenty of teenagers get into too make a few extra bucks in school. Its absolutely horrid there parents have sold them out and if they were to do this to their own children then there obviously not of sound mind and probably would have done this even if they were &quot;A&quot; Students who attended church every sunday.<br />People of all ages have the right to use SR, I was told about it pre-gawker by my Sister who was of the same age as one of the &quot;kids&quot; (young adults) in this article. Or i suppose this should be a special club just for you and whoever you say? Maybe you should be in charge of the invite system all these people who have just signed up so desperately want brought in, after all you are qualified, you were addicted to weed!

Im mid-20s before you start accusing me of being a &quot;kid&quot;

Obviously your still stuck at home with mum and dad, working at McDonalds a couple of hours here and there in between delivering junk mail as you save up to buy a 0.5g of meth. You sound as stupid as those two kids involved. Calling two dumbass teenagers revolutionaries is fucking ridiculous and demonstrates to me a level of intelligence where your IQ would struggle to hit double digits. These arrogant idiots, through there own actions, gave their parents the ammunition they needed to call the Police and once again enshroud SR with this &quot;kid&#039;s are using SR&quot; cloud. I don&#039;t believe drugs have a place in the life of a child, 0-18yrs.&nbsp; &gt;:( If you sneak around&nbsp; with some mates and occasionally sneak a puff of some weed after buying a 50 off a friend or maybe pop a pill at your mate&#039;s 17th birthday party and manage to keep your parents out of the loop, good luck to ya.

Just the fact that they are using Tor and bitcoins, and are importing weed to me makes them revolutionaries, just like all who use SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just sad their own parents busted them but that&#039;s life, unfortunately.<br /><br />As for your beliefs, guess what, they are just that, yours.&nbsp; Nobody but you gives a fuck about them.&nbsp; If a kid is going to do drugs, weed is going to do no harm to them.&nbsp; Their own parents have just done them more harm than anything else by purposefully putting them into the system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Seriously champ, your undoubtedly lacking common sense, a good indication of your age and lack of life experience. Kid&#039;s using this site are NOT REVOLUTIONARIES!!&nbsp; DPR and his team are the true revolutionaries, designing this site and implementing it, with it&#039;s sophisticated security measures onto the Hidden Web for people to use and enjoy. I do think it&#039;s sad that there own parents felt the need to dob them in but if one was to use some common sense, I would put my money on these parents were at the end of there tether and had lost complete control over what they did, where they went or who they were associating with. I&#039;d bet this wasn&#039;t the first time they had been in trouble with either the cops or at school prior to this. <br />My beliefs are my&nbsp; beliefs and I don&#039;t give a fuck what you think of them. The parents did what they thought they had to. If they thought they could of handled it themselves, I&#039;m sure they would of but I&#039;m in no doubt that there were prior underlying problems which were brought to a head by this. Weed can be a fucking dangerous drug, especially the hydro shit, and I&#039;m more than qualified to comment on this since I was addicted to weed. I was that addicted to smoking weed from a bong that my body started to shut down on 8 occasions,&nbsp; putting me in hospital for weeks each time. My body actually started to burn muscle instead of fat for energy and the Doc said to me after I told him I smoke a lot, if I don&#039;t stop smoking I was going to die. That was over 15 yrs ago now and it took 4 sessions with a Hypnotist for me to finally give it up. Haven&#039;t touched it since. Weed for most adults, is nothing much to worry about, but it really shouldn&#039;t be smoked by kids who are still growing and developing, especially today&#039;s hydro with all the chemicals. Adults have a responsibility to give children a good education and the life skills they need so that when there old enough to make there own decisions,&nbsp; you can trust it will be an informed one. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Right and you smoked weed for the first time at what age? Oh you waited til you were 25 did you until your brain was fully developed and then got addicted to weed? I highly doubt it and if you did wait until you were 25 AND THEN got addicted to a substance most people have gotten over by that age let alone addicted to the point there body was shutting down then you have no right to comment on a bunch of &quot;kids&quot; who have thought outside the box when it comes to getting involved in a trade plenty of teenagers get into too make a few extra bucks in school. Its absolutely horrid there parents have sold them out and if they were to do this to their own children then there obviously not of sound mind and probably would have done this even if they were &quot;A&quot; Students who attended church every sunday.<br />People of all ages have the right to use SR, I was told about it pre-gawker by my Sister who was of the same age as one of the &quot;kids&quot; (young adults) in this article. Or i suppose this should be a special club just for you and whoever you say? Maybe you should be in charge of the invite system all these people who have just signed up so desperately want brought in, after all you are qualified, you were addicted to weed!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fuck Ben, first time in ages you decide to write a post more than a couple of words long and this is the result!!&nbsp; WTF!&nbsp; How is&nbsp; the age of&nbsp; 25 relevant to anything I said or is this more about yourself champ?&nbsp; If you fucking read my prior post and actually comprehended what I wrote, I mentioned it was sad that the parents felt the need to dob them in <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I do think it&#039;s sad that there own parents felt the need to dob them in</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> but they didn&#039;t &quot;sell them out&quot; mate, they took the action, as parents, they thought they had to, in order for their kids to stop doing it!

One only has to read through some of your posts to confirm what I just said. Selling drugs is NOT A TRADE dumbass, and if &quot;SCHOOL KIDS&quot; want some extra money, GET A FUCKING JOB LIKE MOST KIDS DO AND WHEN THEY FINISH SCHOOL AND MOVE OUT OF THEIR PARENTS HOUSE INTO THEIR OWN PLACE, THEY CAN THINK &quot;OUTSIDE THE SQUARE&quot;&nbsp; ALL THEY FUCKING WANT AND DO AS THEY PLEASE BUT WHEN YOU LIVE WITH YOUR PARENTS AND THEY ARE SUPPORTING YOU, HAVE THE DECENCY TO SHOW A&nbsp; LITTLE RESPECT FOR THEM,!!!! Shit everyone, Ben and his sister, who he informs us, just in case you missed it,&nbsp; was the same age as the two teenagers( the Original Revolutionaries) caught, should also be added to this growing list of &quot;Revolutionaries&quot; cause their achievements deserve our recognition. Ben, you are now in charge of the &quot;Recruitment of the Teenage Revolutionaries&quot;, and should invite all to join and learn the TRADE. They will eventually graduate and&nbsp; get a Diploma of&nbsp; Selling&nbsp; Drugs (Street Level). Before you jump in Ben and write garbage, do us all a fovor and inform yourself first.&nbsp; :(

I think ruining anyone&#039;s life with a criminal record simply for using drugs is unfair and disgusting. But trying to paint teens who use SR out to be geniuses is ridiculous. Your angry ranting isn&#039;t helping their case either. So far, we still haven&#039;t seen any responses from teens who admit that they still have much to learn and that perhaps those that have more life experience are wiser than them. All we have is angry teens who refuse to believe the fact that adults do know more than them, and people with delusions of grandeur who think that using SR makes them precocious special snowflakes.

				&quot;Their fucking 15 and 17 of course there fucking high school students, since when does anyone in primary school use a hidden website with cryptographic currency to order illegal mind altering substances and sell them to there peers&quot;<br /><br />Well, I think this most likely has happened. A while ago, I read a news piece about some kids that had ordered marijuana from the Internet (this means Silk Road or Black Market) and one of them had also dealt it. I only know they were under 15 since that is the age in Finland when you can be prosecuted, and they were not. So I think some people in primary school, somewhere have done it. Probably not in the States however, with your schooling system.. (: ))<br /><br />Here&#039;s the article: http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/120309-poliisi-lapset-tilasivat-netista-huumeita<br /><br />For those unable to read that, it says:<br /><br />An exceptional drug offense has been uncovered in Kokkola, involving children under the age of 15 who had ordered drugs on the Internet. Investigators tell that investigations are not continued due to the young age of the offenders. Four children from Kokkola had managed to buy marihuana from the Internet. The police won&#039;t tell exactly from where the drugs were bought or how they were delivered. All the children had used the marihuana and one of them had also supplied it to others. The police say that they are considered about drug exprementation becoming more and more common with children even under the age of 15.

Your right buying drugs on the internet is a privlege not a right, infact life is a privlege not a right, something your admission of drug abuse at such a level dictates that you have metaphorically spat in the face of.<br />I see you didn&#039;t address any of my points but preceded hypocritically throw a Hissy fit while completly misinterpreting posts that even the most handicapped of individuals could easily chomprehend.

I think ruining anyone&#039;s life with a criminal record simply for using drugs is unfair and disgusting. But trying to paint teens who use SR out to be geniuses is ridiculous. Your angry ranting isn&#039;t helping their case either. So far, we still haven&#039;t seen any responses from teens who admit that they still have much to learn and that perhaps those that have more life experience are wiser than them. All we have is angry teens who refuse to believe the fact that adults do know more than them, and people with delusions of grandeur who think that using SR makes them precocious special snowflakes.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If they were such geniuses they wouldn&#039;t have got caught.

For this kid to still be contacting you through SR after all that&#039;s happened to him and the publicity surrounding his case, is an perfect example of someone literally not understanding the consequences of there actions! Anyone with any brains would not be contacting drug dealers over the net, having just been arrested for that very offence, despite how safe they think they may be. The kid&#039;s as mad as a cut snake! Ben Cousin&#039;s will think he&#039;s a revolutionary, a pioneer for others his age. :(

All your posts lack any detail and are nothing but a flawed and very vague generalization of God knows what! I&#039;d like to point out just how much of a dickhead you really are with what you&#039;ve posted about the above mentioned Encrypted USB Flash Drive. Let&#039;s go.<br /><br />The thread title was - Re: Can someone teach me how to setup bootable USB securely with Tor &amp; encryption? <br /><br />I pointed out that Truecrypt can do this for you and posted a link for yourself and the other bloke.<br /><br />Then you write -<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Im looking for help doing this also.. and what wadozo appears to be trying to explain is how to encrypt a HDD on a PC not a bootable USB. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I then responded with the following - <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Ben, what are you on about? Truecrypt can encrypt a HDD (hard disk drive) and can&nbsp; run in so-called portable mode, which means that it does not have to be installed on the operating system under which it is run. All the info is there on how to do it BC, you just need to take some time out from tweaking and read it. Link is below for you (clearnet site)<br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=truecrypt-portable</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You then conclude with this comment - <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> ive tried a few times with no success however im not that technically savvy but i thought a portable HDD like a USB is unable to handle a portable OS</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off, a flash drive, thumb drive, USB stick, what ever you want to call it, is not a portable HDD as such. What do you mean when you say a flash drive is unable to handle a portable o/s? Why would you say such a thing when in a quote above you&#039;ve written about a boot-able USB? What do you think is going to boot it Ben?&nbsp; Once again&nbsp; Ben, Truecrypt can run in Portable Mode on a USB Flash Drive, but you need to read for yourself on how to do it. Stop posting shit on the forum and do a bit of reading, who knows champ, you just might learn something.&nbsp; ::)

				lol wadozo most people would be able to use some more lateral thinking to decipher the meaning of a sentence that has a typo or two, you on the other hand don&#039;t appear to have this ability and i genuinely feel sorry for you, whether this is something you were born with or whether it is because of the 25 years of drug addiction you so proudly boast about. Congratulations, you know more about computers and Operating Systems then myself. This is something i am still learning and will learn with time, you on the other hand appear to be a lost cause and will probably live out the rest of your days slowly getting stupider and stupider (if that is even possible). Stop posting champ and re-read through this thread without your self-important bias and you will see how the younger members that you so greatly despise, have completely ripped you to shreds.

				Unfortunate that the parents were such incompetent statists as to rat out their kids instead of actually *gasp* doing some parenting themselves. <br />Really has nothing to do with their age; the bastards could&#039;ve as easily been their flatmates or something. <br />Though, it&#039;s always amusing how things like this spark a little flame war between the liberals and the anarchists on here. Automatic +1 to the latter.

				As long as you&#039;re intelligent enough to realize what exactly you&#039;re getting yourself into and know how to act like a mature person, I don&#039;t see the problem with kids using this site...<br />But unfortunately that&#039;s not what happens around here, at least summer is over and all the kiddies are back in school. The boards have been so quiet and peaceful with them gone.

In more then a week you have had time to re-evaluate what you have written on here, and at worst come back with at least a half decent response regarding the topic at hand. Instead you have decided to embarrass yourself even further with incoherent dribble that brings this topic back from the dead to allow more people to laugh at you. You say that people with a certain number attached to them are too immature to use Silk Road, except that every single person who has posted in this thread with this number attached has provided a way more mature and calculated response then the incoherent ramblings that you still havent given up on. I think the Alzheimers and dementia is really starting to effect you mate. Time to lay off the drugs for good and stop posting on here, or go back and report your &quot;findings&quot; to your superiors at whatever LEA you work for as im convinced only someone who has abused drugs to the absolute limit or a LEO could be as stupid as you.

Absolutely fucking ridiculous attitude to take. What exactly are we classing as &quot;Hard shit&quot; here? Because cannabis can make you paranoid as fuck (the reason I don&#039;t smoke it) and shrooms you can spin the fuck out on and do all sorts of crazy shit on. I know I have. If you are going to allow pot and shrooms you should have absolutely fuck all problem with Bing/MDMA and the other jolly customers. The only ones that should be a massive no-no is Smack, Crack, Meth and the other highly addictive Opiates and probably PCP.<br /><br />And also, why the fuck are we telling this kid to go elsewhere where he will probably get absolute crap on the streets. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not advocate selling to kids, at all. The fact is though the guy/girl/kangaroo is here now and they are clearly going to find out how to buy drugs from SR, you may as well point them in the RIGHT direction so they don&#039;t either A. get ripped off or B. buy some bent shit that could land them in A+E. <br /><br />@ MycoGirl, stop being such a stereotypical hippie retard that thinks that &quot;natural is the safest&quot; because you are so out west you may as well be in Japan. All drugs have risks attached to them which is why you have to be responsible with them. <br /><br />@BigBill, read the above twice and stop being such a tosser. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know where the fuck the common sense has gone on here but Jesus Christ I wish it would come back. <br /><br />@ Godzilla1, if you want decent LSD then I suggest you go to 3Jane, she is a very reputable vendor and has quality product. Shrooms I don&#039;t know much about or the vendors for them but just make sure you read the vendors history carefully and view their stats etc so you can find the most reliable source. I HIGHLY suggest you read the reviews that are available in the Rumor Mill forum and do some research on them. Regarding how to get BTC if you are an American then getting a MoneyPak and going to CoinBox is probably your most fast and easiest route.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just saying Lim

				WTF are you on about Ben? Your a piece of work accusing me on this forum (different thread) of &quot;using lines posted by you and others for my own posts!&quot; LMFAO. Firstly Ben, incoherent dribble is a term you have plagiarized from ME. Look back through the posts and point out when you last used that phrase. I last used it back on Page 4 Reply No.81 of this thread!!! You can barely put together a meaningful sentence. How you have reached the conclusion that I have, or would ever use, anything you&#039;ve posted is a complete load of bullshit. Here&#039;s your chance Ben to PUT UP OR SHUT UP! Post anything you feel I have &quot;stolen&quot; from a post by you for all to see. I can categorically confirm without a shadow of doubt, that I have never plagiarized anything from anyone, especially someone such as you Ben, equipped with the vocabulary of a goldfish who has trouble spelling your own name. Looking forward to seeing where I have used comments made by you for use in my own posts. Post away champ and clear this up. How you intend to post anything regarding this is beyond me, as I&#039;ve never done it.

				What you loosers need to realise is that anyone can access this site there is no age limit and the sole reason your getting pissed off is that you think these kind of propaganda articles will be detrimental to your own accessibility of recieveing products. These kids aren&#039;t stupid, the mother is nuts and shouldn&#039;t touch her children&#039;s mail. I know of someone that personally knows the two, and will ask for them jump on this discussion.

But not you Wadozo. You cant comprehend the meaning of a sentence that obviously is too much for your limited intellect to understand so instead you keep going and going reciting to typing in ALL CAPS in some vain attempt to make your ramblings seem more credible Even something like giveup and stop posting champ, an extremely basic and easy to understand piece of advice has flown right over your head. Your last reply made no sense and nobody with half a brain is going to believe a junkie living on welfare and a disability pension such as yourself worked in Germany let alone knows the Identity of anonymous member of an anonymous forum who is very unlikely to give up their real Identity to some&nbsp; meth-fiend who cant even string together a sentence and goes on incoherent rambling in ALL CAPS about nothing.

				Silk Road is only here because the laws state getting high is illegal.<br /><br />Kids will buy drugs and its likely to happen even more so when drugs are illegal,<br /><br />I have seen 9 year olds taking drugs, and a freind who does drug testing has seen kids of all ages on every drug you can imagine and some we do not even know much about.<br /><br />I think 18 is an accepted age but in reality when you were 15 you started to make choices of your own.

				The point I&#039;ve tried to get across is yes, kids will always experiment and use drugs.That&#039;s a given! However, I certainly wouldn&#039;t encourage it or allow my kids to do so at home. When they are legally responsible for their own actions and have their own place, by all means they can do as they please and decide for themselves if they wish to use drugs, but kids living at home with their parents should show them some respect and not, as these kids did, import drugs from overseas and sell them whilst still living there. I don&#039;t believe, and it&#039;s just my opinion, kids should use this site. There is a lot to know and understand on using this place safely and staying anonymous. Whilst I&#039;m sure some kids are extremely computer savvy, it&#039;s not the only attribute which enables the safe use of SR.<br /><br />Ben, pleeeeas stop posting untruths. I worked overseas for many years, not just in Germany, but in other parts of Europe for almost a decade. I know you work at fish and chip shop on Tuesday nights, but many people world wide, work overseas at various times throughout their careers should the opportunity arise. Since you are an uneducated bum living off the taxes paid by people who are gainfully employed, this is an opportunity that won&#039;t be afforded to you. How you read my last post and still say it made no sense is becoming clearer. Are you from Lithuania!! Climb upon your wooden horse and skip off into the sunset Ben. :-[

				A part of me kind of wants to agree with the OP but at the same time I try to remember how I was years ago as a teenager how drugs always interested me. I guess it&#039;s normal and it won&#039;t be stopped any time soon. <br />At least SR provides better quality than your average street dealer who sells crap to kids. The bad experiences they make here might also be helpful - if they fuck up and get busted they will get scared shitless eventually and tell other stupid kids not to do it - the sooner they realize getting in the drug business is some serious fucking shit the better. Yeah they end up on the news, it&#039;s bad press bla - but don&#039;t act like there&#039;s no adults out there who ruin it also for everyone - how many more &quot;first time meth&quot; threads do we have to read? Seriously? So you make it somehow to use TOR, SR, Bitcoins but can&#039;t do some basic research on wikipedia, erowid and whatever to not know that it will ruin your life with a 90% probability (optimistic)? There&#039;s any kind of people of all ages - smart, stupid whatever. Being 18 doesn&#039;t make you a responsible drug user - being mature does. By the way&nbsp; - not supporting underage SR users - definitely wish it would somehow be possible to prevent kids from using it - but it&#039;s not.

But it&#039;s a fact that the stakes and risks are higher doing drugs as a kid/teenager - I did it myself so I&#039;m not judging anyone who does it now - but it&#039;s not something I would encourage others to do. Even if SR is awesome and it&#039;s my strong opinion that drugs should be legalized - it&#039;s still illegal almost everywhere. By doing what you do you are willingly committing a crime&nbsp; - doesn&#039;t matter if morally speaking it&#039;s not a crime but I guess in most countries you can&#039;t really be responsible for your actions unless you&#039;re over 18, sometimes even 21 (trial and so on).&nbsp; If you&#039;re kid ordering drugs online to the house where other family members live you&#039;re just clearly not giving a fuck about your family and the harm you can cause if you do get busted - and that for me is not a mature behavior. I can only speak for myself but I&#039;ve tried to keep people I care about out of drug use - not because I need to hide it - but because I don&#039;t want to involve them in something involuntarily.<br /><br />Oh and about that meth statement - my point wasn&#039;t that every meth user is a retard - there&#039;s all kinds of people who do all kinds of drugs with all kinds of IQs and ages, but certain drugs attract certain people. Sure, there&#039;s also people that can absolutely function normally in society and be addicted to heroin or other opiates. But still - a lot of people have failed to do so and live a life they sure didn&#039;t plan that way. I don&#039;t think having respect for hard drugs that clearly lead to physical addiction&nbsp; like meth or heroin is a prejudice.

For all we know some of the most prolific members or even vendors could be in their teens, hell&nbsp; Ive met some preety clever and entrepreneurial high schoolers especially when it comes to drugs (although this isnt true of the majority).&nbsp; In parts of europe and alot of other countries there is no designated age when one can purchase alcohol (a drug) so why should there be one one here. I dont think the Majority of members realize that SR, or humanity for that matter extends well beyond the boundries of the the US,UK,CAN,AUS and any other country that dictates the age in which people are legally considered responsible. Teenagers have always done drugs and will continue to, just like im sure most people here probably made some sort of drug transaction under the age of 18. Its short memories that allows tyranny to prevail (Animal Farm anyone?)<br /><br />and s1np3l0, Im an occasional meth user, for abit of fun. Im also a certified Member of Mensa (I.Q.145&gt;, $60 annual fee) so dont come here with your drug prejudice as prejudice is why the current drug laws exist. Maybe ill go buy half a point of meth (Australian prices) rather then renew my Membership fee next year!<br /><br />BC<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, as I said before - I agree that age limits make no sense. But it&#039;s a fact that the stakes and risks are higher doing drugs as a kid/teenager - I did it myself so I&#039;m not judging anyone who does it now - but it&#039;s not something I would encourage others to do. Even if SR is awesome and it&#039;s my strong opinion that drugs should be legalized - it&#039;s still illegal almost everywhere. By doing what you do you are willingly committing a crime&nbsp; - doesn&#039;t matter if morally speaking it&#039;s not a crime but I guess in most countries you can&#039;t really be responsible for your actions unless you&#039;re over 18, sometimes even 21 (trial and so on).&nbsp; If you&#039;re kid ordering drugs online to the house where other family members live you&#039;re just clearly not giving a fuck about your family and the harm you can cause if you do get busted - and that for me is not a mature behavior. I can only speak for myself but I&#039;ve tried to keep people I care about out of drug use - not because I need to hide it - but because I don&#039;t want to involve them in something involuntarily.<br /><br />Oh and about that meth statement - my point wasn&#039;t that every meth user is a retard - there&#039;s all kinds of people who do all kinds of drugs with all kinds of IQs and ages, but certain drugs attract certain people. Sure, there&#039;s also people that can absolutely function normally in society and be addicted to heroin or other opiates. But still - a lot of people have failed to do so and live a life they sure didn&#039;t plan that way. I don&#039;t think having respect for hard drugs that clearly lead to physical addiction&nbsp; like meth or heroin is a prejudice.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I dont tell anyone about SR because the less that know about this place the lower the chance we have of the idiots flockng to the site who will be the ones to bring SR down. Its like the refugee situation, we create a sort of utopia that everyone wants to come too but if we let them all in, it just goes back to what it was before and the reason we seperated. SHIT!<br />The stakes here are considerably lower, plus being caught with drugs as a kid is usually comes with a diversion program as your just being young and stupid but when a mature adults gets caught you get whatever the judges mood on the day decides on, so in that respect drugs are actually safer for kids to use. If your talking about mentally then most studies agree the brain doesnt stop developing until 25, therefore alcohol paracetamol cough medicine and any other drug that has an effect on the brain shouldnt be given to anyone under 25. You may be committing a crime but your not exactly sending a fax to the &lt;insert your country&#039;s alphabet mafia&gt; are you? The whole point of SR is that your not even within earshot of LE, SR if used correctly is near on impossible to get busted, your package intercepted yes, but charged no. Getting your whole family busted over your mail order gram of weed is abit far fetched and typical of the overtop paranoia that inhabits these forums. Not many teenagers live out of home and thats not gonna stop them ordering drugs so using the safer option of SR is a more mature decision IMO.<br /><br />Seeming your so against &quot;hard drugs&quot; remember to tell the doctors if you ever have an horrific accident that breaks every bone in your body that you will do without the morphine because these kinds of drugs only attract &quot;certain types of people&quot;&nbsp; and it sounds like you dont want to be one of them. If you have or ever have children make sure you never give him his ADD/ADHD medication that his doctor will more then willing prescribe to him as these drugs only attract &quot;certain types of people&quot;.

Maybe&nbsp; my way of expressing my views in English sucks cause it&#039;s not my native language but it seems like you don&#039;t understand what I&#039;m saying. My point right from the start was exactly what you say now - it&#039;s not gonna stop anyways, so bitching about it won&#039;t help either. I just said I wouldn&#039;t encourage teenagers to use SR. That&#039;s it. <br /><br />About getting your whole family busted - that&#039;s just ridiculous. I didn&#039;t mean it like that. But if you get in trouble as a kid it sure does take a toll on normal, caring parents. That&#039;s at least my experience. Respecting other peoples opinion is as important to be free. If you&#039;re such a fan of SR and the freedom behind it that&#039;s fine - you still have to respect people who don&#039;t like drugs (in this case parents). If you live under someones roof and depend on their money etc. you can at least try to avoid shitting on other peoples values. Doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t get high anywhere else or send drugs anywhere else. <br /><br />The point I tried to make with &quot;attracts certain people&quot; is that there&#039;s definitely more people who have nothing to lose anymore doing hard drugs than any other drug. Doesn&#039;t mean all people who do it are people who are gonna end up living on the street sucking dicks for meth. Not everyone who does MDMA is a raver doing it in a club. I said it before, I&#039;ll say it again - all kinds of different people do different drugs and there&#039;s no real stereotype - but physical addiction sure does lead a lot of people to failure. Deny it all you want.<br /><br />I&#039;m not against hard drugs. I don&#039;t care if other people do it and I don&#039;t mind occasionally taking some (though not meth and heroin) myself. Physical addiction is not something I&#039;m making up - it&#039;s a fact. Many people underestimate that - also a fact that can be seen in any mayor city anywhere. I never judged anyone who does it and never generalized all meth/heroin/hard drug users - but I haven&#039;t seen &quot;weed-addicts&quot; robbing so they can buy their next ounce - why? Cause they don&#039;t feel the same need to get the next fix. Also hilarious comparison between medical treatment and recreational drug use. Totally the same thing. Very good point. I&#039;m not even gonna go there and point out that there&#039;s enough medication that is not administered to children. Bla. This discussion is pointless, especially if your answers consist of tries to ridicule other peoples views. You might be right with most points you make but your constant sarcasm and irony ruin it.<br /><br />Anyways, I didn&#039;t mean to offend you or anyone else. <br /><br />

I think it&#039;s a valid point but there&#039;s no way to prevent that. I don&#039;t think the media reaction is the same if some 50 year old guy overdoses, dies and turns out he got the stuff from SR compared to if it was a 15 year old kid. <br />Anyways, as you, BC and others have already pointed out, there&#039;s no way to prevent that - and yeah this thread is useless. <br />I just answered here cause I found the teen drug abuse topic interesting. That&#039;s all :D <br />

				You&#039;ve got a point here&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br />Somehow arguing in public sometimes seems to be better, IRL or ... IIL? :p<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about that unwanted media attention. Silk Road has been on a dutch television show. Though that was wanted attention (i suppose), I think I wouldn&#039;t have minded if I heard about it somewhere else. Not sure about this yet.<br />Ofcourse more scammers might and will come, but also more legit people who just don&#039;t have certain connections (be it customers or vendors).<br />The SR system just needs to become more scam-proof then (and now). Though I have no clue how.<br /><br />Oh well.. That&#039;s up to SR. They get the money AND the drugs so I think they can think of stuff while still making money off of it.<br /><br />I know for sure that if this would exist when I was still a kid I&#039;d have gotten in a lot less shit and maybe even lost less money on crap. So fuck this topic. Rename it to retarded dumb people are not allowed, iq over 120 or something. Would make more sense but would still be utterly pointless.

I dont agree with your drug predjudice, because its a dangerous precedent and its what SR is fighting against. The government and many people in society regularly practice drug predjudice, <br />there not allowed to judge people by colour anymore but should they enjoy something other then alcohol and tobacco and its time to get those pitchforks out folks!<br /><br />I dont encourage SR (reason stated above) or any drugs to anyone because its a choice that needs to be made by each individual. Most people will natually become curious and thats when it will happen, some will enjoy it too much of course, others will just spend the rest of their lifes drinking themself into liver cirrhosis, and a bunch of other people will spend there life jumping off things like say a baloon from 125,000 feet in the stratosphere or climbing mount everest. <br /><br />If parents are setting up their children (you know those things that are made by you to carry on your genes and you are are suppose to defend until death) for federal drug importation and trafficking charges then darwins theory of natural selection should have these people eliminated before they can breed.....oh wait, they have and they have ruined the future of their offspring, I couldnt think of a worse kind of betrayal, its treason at the highest level (yes, family comes before &quot;state&quot;)<br /><br />If people dont like drugs then i respect there personal opinion,more power to them, it may advantage them in some way as in that they are increasing there mental or physical strengths while everyone is down the pub for Friday night drinks, alot of some of the greatest people in history may infact have had this as a contributing reason for what they achieved. I believe in Moderation and aslong as i do not&nbsp; harm another human being then i dont see a reason why i should be chased with the metaphorical pitchforks.<br />&nbsp;I dont like organised religion but i and nobody else should ruin my/their childrens/anyone life because of this decision made by the mind of a another human being that is in contrast to the opinion of another. Very few kids especially in my shitty generation who all feel they are entitled to something, live out of their parents home especially at 15 and 17 as was mentioned in the article. But teens like drugs, somebody has to get these kids drugs(supply=demand economics), so these young adults brought some drugs for a price and sold them for a higher price (due to demand) and used the money so they would have become less of a financial burden on their parents and more independent. They made consensual financial transactions of the same type that happens minutely at your local 7/11. They have broken no moral or naturals laws.<br /><br />The people &quot;who have nothing to lose&quot; i see tend to do alot less of the harder drugs then the guys i know who are sound of mine work hard and go out and party. The people i know with nothing to lose see maybe some meth as a once every couple of month treat as they can just get off their head cheaply and constantly on weed and alcohol ( the soft drugs) and meth and heroin are just too expensive, believe me if anyone knows how to get value for money, its compulsive drug abusers on welfare (not always on welfare though). I think your reasoning behind this is another case of the vocal minority. For every waked out heroin addict on the corner begging because he cant afford his over-priced cartel controlled (risk=reward economics) next hit when there is 100 other users going about their business working a job and then using. You dont see alcoholics (one of three commonly abused drugs that are physically addictive but we will get to that later) begging on a corner because they can go down to their local bottle shop on every corner and buy a cask of mine for $8 which will cure his addiction for a few days.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ok now lets get to physical addiction. There are a 3 commonly used drugs i can think of off top of my head that are physically adictive. Heroin, Alcohol and those wonderful drugs you americans are presrcibed like panadols....benzodiazapenes such Xanax,Valium, Cloazepam and a fuckload others that just get thrown around for anyone who is for any reason &quot;different&#039; . &quot;Oh shit young tom has an imaginary friend he plays with when mon and dad are at work, better get him on the xanax real quick&quot;. Alcohol in all fairness takes A LONG time before physical addiction takes hold and i did use to know how that worked but im actually on xanax now (ironic isnt it) and cant dig up how that works somewhere in my pyschy. Heroin actually replaces the endorphins in your body so when you constantly use it your body is like &quot;i dont need to make anymore endorphins cozi got plenty, so it stops making them. Endorphins is what blunts out pain in your body, say your body brushes on something, your still putting pressure on your nerves but endorphins stop you from feeling intense pain, so when you get off the H your body dont have no endorphins, and it dont have no heroin. hopefully you can understand what im getting at now but thats why heroin withdrawls look and probably are so bad, its extreme physical pain from EVERYTHING. Now benzos, im gonna be honest and say i have not looked right into the mechanism of it, but there probably the most famous for physical addictions, ive even know of a mate who started taking them recreationaly and just took more and more and got to the point if he didnt have his xanax a day his lungs partially collapsed. I have no clue how this happens but i do know that they are horribly physically addicted.<br />Just to clarify physical addiction is very rare, its when your body becomes reliant on a drug to function. While meth and other strong drugs may seem physically addictive and can have an extreme strong effect on the mind, your body could function normally if you smoked meth everyday for 20years and one day went cold turkey. I imagine the mental effects of this would be the definition of hell (ive gone through serious depression myself so i know that feeling, but this would have to be on a completely different level) I would also like to mention most meth psychosis is to do with sleep deprivation mores so then the actual meth, thing is your brain starts micro napping while your still wide awake causing a bluring of the two realities (dreamland and the real world) is probably the most laymans term i could describe that.<br />As for weed addcts theres heaps of them ( I personally dont like the stuff, got anxiety), but when someone robs someone you have no idea what they are robbing you for its not like they tell you, they just want their money, hell you know how many 7/11and servos get held up for ciggies seeming they dont have fuckall cash in the registers anymore. They could be robbing you coz they may actually want a feed (although majority of the time its for drugs, alcohol included) but you cant say i know what his robbing me for. the number of Weed addicts outnumber the next closest number of illict drug addicts like 5:1, alot of the time they do nothing and are there absolute freeloaders, but once again no drug prejudice.<br /><br />The medical thing was me trying to highlight how people think their are &quot;evil&quot; drugs. Heroin and meth are both wonderful drugs. Heroin and Meth addicts are not. Heroin is still not understood of how it works to block pain even in this day and age.&nbsp; Methamphetamine is great for anxiety and dextroamphetamine is stronger then meth on a mg per mg basis then meth and thats prescribed to&nbsp; kids with &quot;ADD&quot; a disorder that has no concrete evidence of proving if it even exists. Desoxyn is prescribed to people with ADHD (Michael Phelps) and you know what desoyn is? Its lab grade METHamphetamine. So im not talking about the shit cooked in frank the bikers bathtub, even though i know thats what im most likely taking, im talking about the actual molecule. &quot;Theres no such thing as a dangerous drug, only a dangerous dose&quot;<br /><br /><br />This is probably tl;dr so i hope you at least read this part. I wasnt trying to argue with you and i apologize for coming across that way. Im Australian and our humorous/confrontational way of communicating tends to get lost on most other people (except the brits) but there wasnt anything malicious intent, i was merely debating, meaning i respect your opinion and try to invoke my knowledge/argument so that maybe i could demonstrate a different point of view for you to look at. Its the same way that i actually like when people correct me if i am wrong or show me things in a different light, i guess thats kind of how we all became pro-drugs haha? we were all grown up to see drugs as bad but someone, somewhere must have done something to open your mind more? haha<br />Peace<br />BC

Its the same way that i actually like when people correct me if i am wrong or show me things in a different light, i guess thats kind of how we all became pro-drugs haha? we were all grown up to see drugs as bad but someone, somewhere must have done something to open your mind more? haha<br />Peace<br />BC<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey,<br /><br />first off thanks for taking your time in replying in this manner. I actually did read it all cause it&#039;s an interesting topic and you have experiences that I don&#039;t. I don&#039;t have the time to reply to everything you pointed out (kinda in a hurry :D), but I think it&#039;s safe to say I misunderstood some of your previous posts. Again, I&#039;m all pro-drugs, absolutely and it&#039;s also funny that you mentioned the sky-diving or climbing Mount Everest cause that&#039;s almost exactly how I was trying to make the same point about choosing what to do with your life (concerning drugs) to someone else in RL. There is so much stuff out there that could kill you if you just over-do it - it doesn&#039;t have to be a substance it can also be binge-eating or binge-not-eating or whatever - like you said - moderation is the key. I think my strong negative view about meth/heroin is caused by negative experiences I&#039;ve had with friends. My point of view is just me being scared of it and I absolutely admit that I am scared of these drugs - not only because of stories, things I&#039;ve seen but also because as everyone here on SR I&#039;m interested in drugs and reading things like &quot;heroin is the best high there is out there&quot; give me a strong impulse to find out what&#039;s behind that - at the same time another impulse is telling me not to go that far and just be happy with what I already did drugwise. By the way there really are a lot of threads about people wanting to try meth for the first time and as far as I can see, the responses are mostly negative - from people that did or still do large amounts of it - so it&#039;s interesting reading another opinion. Again, as you stated, the right dose is crucial - I guess most drugs have negative effects at some point after a certain quantity. I happily do MDMA but I&#039;m sure there are enough people that had bad experiences with it by taking why too much. <br /><br />I guess it&#039;s just safe to say I agree with everything you said :D <br />This is such a large issue that we could write here for hours talking about how fucked up our society is, no matter where yo live. It&#039;s upsetting to see how corporations make profit out of addiction - referring to your Xanax point. Same goes for alcohol, tobacco .. and so on the list is long. I guess our points of view are also different because of the very different locations we live in - a lot of stuff is the same everywhere (alcoholics etc.) but some details are different.<br /><br />I guess the most important point you made in your last reply was the last sentence - education is crucial when it comes to drugs. There&#039;s so much misinformation out there - there even is a whole article about drug urban legends on wikipedia (hilarious read btw) . I was raised with that stupid fear of drugs as being something very bad like most people were. There&#039;s so many biased studies out there about many substances which are distributed and hyped by the press. So it&#039;s good to have a forum like this and to be able to talk about this stuff - so even if there are kids out here (which nobody can prevent)&nbsp; at least they can read how to get high properly without risking it all.<br />Oh and about the humorous thing - it&#039;s kinda hard to interpret stuff like that over the internet but I&#039;ll keep that in mind for your next posts :D <br />Anyways thanks again for your interesting post!<br /><br />SP<br />

				@dreamxweavr&quot; Thats what Tor BTC PGP was spose to do, keep the idiots away, unfortunately its now quite easy with a lil dertemination, something most teenageers cant be fucked with anyway. Thankgod we have so much overthetop paranoia on the forums to maybe give some of them second thoughts even if they get that. Saying that if some teen can do all this compose himself and act like anormal person, open the fucking buffet to him.<br /><br />@s1np3l0: its been gettin publicity for a year and a half now with step by step guides on fucking youube. and you know what this does? a huge influx of low hanging fruit who think its as simple as ordering off ebay (like all those media reports) stuff up, get caught or and&nbsp; get scammed, you know what else happens, sone smarter members stay on and we now have more useful members with some awesome knowledge and more customers and vendors,.<br />&nbsp;Remmeber:: People shouldn&#039;t be cared of their government. the government should scared of it people&quot;<br />The more people that come here the more power we have, its unlikely but if we could just change americas drug stance from the gerneral population, get a good PR campaign for SR&nbsp; then fucking even Ronld Reagan would campaign for us if we had the voter numbers on side. I know its far fetched but if SR can keep on surviving and become a major hub then its possible in the far future. its just a race between mainstrean acceptance and the DEA timing to move just as the pubic wave is about to happen, somehow i think the DEA might be well ahead o us there, Call me paranoid but ive got an oveerhelming hunch that WE ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST (anyone whos seen the end of &quot;law of war&quot; with nicholas cage will get the same principle of what im talking about)<br /><br /><br />@dreamxweaver&nbsp; not fighting, we are exchanging Ideas :D<br /><br />Over 97.6% of transactions on here are completed to absolute satisfaction, not bad for retail, even better for an anonymous online marketplace that specializes in seeling narcotics. I dont think SR could do more to deter scammers, we have escrow for buyers and DCN (whatever its called in your country) for vendors to confirm delivery. we have stats for buyers who honestly are the most likely to scam as they are just end users (no offence) compared to vendors who are businessmen and live and die by there reputation rating. Most people with a business mind aren&#039;t thinking about quick buck, there here for the long run as they realize that with abit of sacrifice and patientce that in the long run (long run could be 2-3 weeks on a place like this) they will continually week after week be making more then you would with a scam<br /><br />the larger this place come, although it is centralized the more like BTC it becomes, sure you could take out the head, but the networks are already established between the users and maybe the first head that gets taken out might have an effect but we will eventually regroup and over time it will become less and less centralized and harder for the agencys at work to determine how to cut off the head. Viva la DPR (if you ever read the priness bride you will know that once DPR is &quot;killed&quot; someone immediately takes his place)
