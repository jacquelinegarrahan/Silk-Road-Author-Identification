				Hey<br /><br />Now I have previously disowned time magazine because of the shoddy articles that have become more and more present in the publication.&nbsp; It has really gone downhill, and I can&#039;t wait to cancel my subscription, however I just happened to open one up and what do I see?&nbsp; A very interesting one page article on bit-coins, my favorite type of currency!&nbsp; Has anyone come across this article I would like to know what your thoughts are on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s in the April 22nd issue!&nbsp; The article in my opinion had more glowing things to say about bit-coins than negatives, quoting many references to the coin such as &quot;The Napster of Money&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Money&quot;!<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in hearing your thoughts on the rumor that the financial crisis in Cyprus, which caused Spanish users to buy bit-coins as an alternative to the euro caused the latest spike and subsequent crash of bit-coins.&nbsp; This sounds like bs to me, but I really have not looked into it.<br /><br />Another thing I did want to mention was Paul Krugman in his NY Times articles statement referring to bit-coins that, <br /><br />&quot;What we want from a monetary system isn&#039;t to make people holding money rich&#039; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />What is this man talking about?&nbsp; Is that not the types of systems we already have?&nbsp; Ones that make the holder of money rich?<br /><br />Help me out here guys!

Because it is being debased through constant money printing and quantitative easing.<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t put too much stock into what nobel-prize winning Krugman has to say,. The man is wedded to establishment thinking. There&#039;s no newness in anything he writes. If you want to learn about economics, listen to Joseph Stieglitz, Richard Wolff&nbsp; and Max Keiser.<br /><br />goblin
