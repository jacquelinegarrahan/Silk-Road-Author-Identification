				yes you can buy on line through bank transfer and other payments , yes you can also meet people if thats the way you want to go , but there is an escrow feature for buying online you will get your coins in minutes , and its safe. i have used it over 30 times and never had any problems , the coins might be a few dollars more than mtgox but you dont need to wait weeks for your coins well worth it . you can also sell them if you want to get rid

				Did a test transaction on their new &quot;beta&quot; site that allows cash deposits. I took quite a few try to get through the verification process (presumably due to site problems - it kept failing). Finally I got through. Since it was a test, I used my own information. They asked a number of fairly invasive questions about me, persons related to me, and places I&#039;ve lived.<br /><br />With the current verification process, I can&#039;t imagine getting verified with fake info. They looked to have a &quot;guest checkout&quot;, but it wasn&#039;t working. Not telling what validation will be required for that.<br /><br />It&#039;s been almost 12 hours since my deposit, and no coins or transaction on Blockchain. My BitInstant account log keeps showing failed attempts to transfer money to mtgox. Problem is, I ordered a transfer to a blockchain address.<br /><br />Not looking good at BitInstant AT ALL. I&#039;m clearly going to be in the market for another way to get bitcoins. No localcoins dealer near me. Crap!

				I&#039;m not if its because I used bitinstant as a guest or what, but I wasn&#039;t asked these verification questions.&nbsp; It was the same as it has been for some time.&nbsp; I just gave fake info except for my name and did the red phone thing at cvs, no problems.

				I just tried accessing the site for Bitcoin Brokers and it says that it is down for maintenance.&nbsp; I am most definitely interested in this site though, since I can&#039;t get Bitinstant to work worth a damn.&nbsp; It keeps saying there is a problem with one of their partners.&nbsp; Anyone use Bitcoin Brokers and have success?
