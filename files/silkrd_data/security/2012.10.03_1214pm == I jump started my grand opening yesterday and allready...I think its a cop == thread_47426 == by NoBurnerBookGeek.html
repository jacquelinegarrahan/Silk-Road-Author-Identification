				Someone asking for (semi) bulk on a fixed schedule? Sounds like a reseller.<br /><br />Whether it&#039;s a gram or an ounce, I don&#039;t see how you came to the conclusion that it&#039;s a cop. He didn&#039;t ask for any information that could identify you.

No one is going to be able to tell you on here whether your prospective buyer is a cop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Prudence demands that you assume that all buyers are a cop. As some people have said, they may be a reseller; this would explain the request for larger, regular shipments. Take a look at the prospective buyer&#039;s Forum history -- elsewhere, he gives an Safe-Mail address. Safe-Mail is notorious for its cooperation with law-enforcement. <br /><br />Finally, your prospective buyer has not published a PGP key, so anyone who contacts them at their Safe-Mail address risks interception of their communications.&nbsp; From all appearances, it would seem that your prospective buyer is either very naive, or very lax, about security -- that alone <br />is reason enough to refuse to do business with them. <br /><br />

				you&#039;re really not cut out to be a vendor...you lack the critical thinking skills to maintain your anonymity and make money regardless of whose buying...<br /><br />i&#039;m pretty sure all the vendors on SR have sold to some sort of LE already...LE is well aware of SR&#039;s existence...that&#039;s just how the process of investigation works...now whether or not that investigation is successful or not depends on how well you cover your tracks so that if they do attempt to trace it back to you it just leads to a dead end....<br /><br />you gotta stay a zillion steps ahead of everyone....

				as said in previous messages, you sound ultra paraniod (are you sure you can be a vendor?)<br /><br />Im not a vendor, but I would guess you will get alot of messages like this.. Alot of them serious, alot of them BS just trying to get a better deal.<br /><br />(I&#039;ll buy an oz a week, give me a good deal, then you never hear from them again)<br /><br />people in RL do this, so im just assuming it&nbsp; would happen even more on here

				Don&#039;t most vendors just _assume_ that some small percentage of their customers is LE?&nbsp; I think if you&#039;re not making that assumption, you probably should, because it&#039;s almost guaranteed to be the case.&nbsp; I imagine a vendor should treat each and every outgoing package like it&#039;s heading to FBI headquarters in Quantico.&nbsp; (Fucking crazy world we live in, where adults aren&#039;t &#039;allowed&#039; to get high.&nbsp; But that&#039;s another thread.)

				As a new vendor you will get quite a bit of the BS. When I first set up I had a guy ask if I could provide 10lbs of magic mushrooms every month. He claimed he could move them. I figured it was a kid or LE or a scammer who had an in with the local postman to not scan the package as delivered and basically told him I don&#039;t do large quantities.<br /><br />

				Yep as a Vendor you must assume that you will be sending to cops. If sending to a cop is going to jeopardize your security then you need to work on your security before you go any further. I treat all customers exactly equally that is the only way to stay safe. Whether they have been buying from me more months or are a newbie seller wanting huge bulk I&#039;ll treat them all with the same level of caution and security. Nobody EVER gets special treatment if it means lessening my security. If a customer chooses not to use PGP that imo is their choice and risk. I strongly encourage it but it really does not affect my operations.<br /><br />It would be pretty cool to know how many cops I&#039;ve mailed stuff too, wonder how much money they&#039;ve handed over :D
