				I have tried everything. I&#039;m pretty much a newbie but a have a friend who is a sr manager at a major software company. He came over the other day and we spent THREE HOURS trying to get Thunderbird email to connect to my Tormail acct. We even broke down and emailed the Tor people to help us but so far have gotten no response. We followed the help instructions on the Tor site to THE LETTER and still no success. I don&#039;t know what to do and this is putting a MAJOR damper on my ability to create a seller acct and get up and running. Is there any other way I can use PGP with my tormail acct? I have figured out PGP finally but I have no way to use it with an email acct that is itself untraceable. My friend said that I could use PGP with hushmail but even that would give away my IP. Hushmail will not connect to Tor, right? I&#039;m at a loss at this point and I want my seller acct up! Help! Any advice or ideas are greatly appreciated.

				Are you following this here?<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/help.html<br /><br />The only thing that seems a little odd in there is the setting of SOCKS v4. Because Aurora sets it to SOCKSv5. Give that a shot. Slim shot, but a shot.

				Yeah man, I&#039;ve been going over those instructions for almost a week now. We tried the socks v4 and v5. I&#039;m using mac. I should have said that in my first post. I&#039;m at a total loss now. Feeling really dejected over it. I tried myself for hours and hours then I called in what I thought would be expert help and even he couldn&#039;t help. I knew I was in the shit then. I have NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT ELSE TO DO. I had all these great plans for my seller acct. I guess I may have to buy a cheap PC and see if I can get it up and running on that. This sucks wangs. UGH! Thanks anyway, tho. I want everyone with ANY IDEA even if it seems silly to respond. Thx again.

				Are you using the Tor Browser bundle? If so, I have noticed that the browser bundle randomly uses a different port each time you start it, but of course the bundled browser is also configured to the right port for the socks v5 proxy too, except this makes it a bit of a pain because each time you start TOR you have to re-configure any other applications besides the browser to the new port that its using.<br /><br />Try this:<br /><br />1. In the Tor browser (aurora) go to the network settings and see which port is listed under the socks v5 proxy, then check to make sure that you have the same port listed in Thunderbird as well.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				Yes I&#039;m using the bundle. I just tried it again for shits and giggles and still nothing. I go through all the motions and everything seems to work then it fails and asks, &quot;Is the username and password correct?&quot; It seems like its connecting but there&#039;s something not quite right. I don&#039;t know. Any ideas at all are GREATLY appreciated. I hoping to hear back from the Tor guys themselves at some point. I can&#039;t be the only one this is happening to. Thanks anyway.
