				What would you guys think if SR made it mandatory to have a SR forum account?<br />Make it mandatory to have at least 50 posts or JR member status in order to make purchases<br />or conduct any business on SR. (this could go for sellers too)<br /><br />This would make sure people know what they&#039;re doing before they actually DO IT.<br />It would cut down on scammers who are just looking for a quick pay day, of a one time buy and not pay or create a new account.<br />I believe it would also cut down on LE trying to attack us.<br />Even the FBI DEA CIA have better stuff to do than reach 50-100 posts on the forums.<br /><br />Maybe even different variations such as minimal purchases ( 1BTC or less) for anyone with less than<br />a SR member rank. And anyone with a SR rank or higher has no restrictions for buying.<br /><br />Just some thoughts, and i believe these can be expanded on greatly, with the help of you guys!<br />I think it would add some more security to SR and despite the fact that<br />it is supposed to be a free market, we have to realize that anyone with an Internet connection can basically find their way here.<br /><br />Lets work together and fight back against LE, scammers, and thieves!<br /><br />Hoping to hear from a lot of people on this!<br /><br />-Jackofspades

				Interesting idea. <br /><br />It could help, but as we have already seen with the newbie forum it is not that difficult to spam your way to 50, or even 100. It could slow them down though. And it might give vendors more incentive to have a healthy forum presence. But it would also make entrance much more difficult for legitimate newcomers to the Road.

				I think this would serve to turn away new memberships on Silk Road, which is pretty much what maple said end of post. I like your idea about sellers conducting business here as buyers first before coming vendors. However, even though a no-brainier, it may restrict certain capable vendors from getting set up quickly. Look at the Junior level restriction (it is not 50 posts btw it is determined by the member level. You cannot reduce the post minimum below 50 b/c you need 50 posts to become a Junior as that is what SR admin have set it as. You would need to modify the global settings for the forum and that would be a mistake.). Think about how much kickback this would ensue. I agree it would cut scamming. OTOH I think we need to keep looking in this regard. FBI/DEA/CIA (lol, did you say CIA?) would still post to 50 anyway, it is no hassle at all for them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142375.msg972694#msg972694">Quote from: jackofspades on April 03, 2013, 08:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe even different variations such as minimal purchases ( 1BTC or less) for anyone with less than<br />a SR member rank.

As in, colossal. Sr is set at 250 posts. No one can reach................ (sorry, I just realised 1 BTC is no longer $10!!) .................. *swallows uncomfortably thinking about the skyrocketing BTC rate*............... Sr member being thus restricted in their purchasing ability. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142375.msg972694#msg972694">Quote from: jackofspades on April 03, 2013, 08:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think it would add some more security to SR and despite the fact that<br />it is supposed to be a free market, we have to realize that anyone with an Internet connection can basically find their way here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s one of the biggest problems we have, that, and the members themselves.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
