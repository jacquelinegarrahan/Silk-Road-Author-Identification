				It&#039;s been a real shitheap lately. I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t have much money in it, it took 2 weeks for them to process my deposit, they didn&#039;t respond to emails and the forums are more or less a crypt. I really hope your money isn&#039;t forfeit, I think its just not receiving much attention whatsoever by management....

				wow, WTF? <br /><br />I just came across this tread because I have only used TH to get BTC via bank wire transfer. I just went there and logged in and was about to initiate another transfer and saw they no longer do the bank wire transfer and I emailed them about it. Then I came here to start searching for other options.<br /><br />I was all set to hit up my bank first thing in the morning as I have a shopping list on SR and I need my BTC... now, I have to figure out how to get BTC all over again. TH hill worked for me each and every time and they were really good in replying to my emails, so TH and wire transfer is all I know.<br /><br />glad I only have scraps in my TH account if it&#039;s true they are playing funny games.

				I&#039;ve been having some problems with TradeHill as well.<br /><br />For the past week, the Instant Buy has been broken, I get this message:<br />Socket not connected<br />Sorry, our notification socket isn&#039;t connected yet. Try again in a few seconds!<br /><br />Trying again in a few seconds/minutes has no effect. I&#039;ve tried inside and outside of tor, in both the latest versions of Firefox and IE. <br /><br />This wouldn&#039;t be a problem except that it&#039;s not processing my regular buy orders. I&#039;m trying to buy BTC for what has been 10-20 cents over what the market rate has been for the last few hours according to both their market data page and mtgox. This worked fine the last couple times, but I am new to using tradehill... is this a common occurrence for everyone?<br /><br />Deposit went smoothly last week, using BoA to BitInstant, and withdrawing btc went ok; I&#039;ve never tried withdrawing USD tho.

				when did all this happen? I haven&#039;t had any probs with TH. I send BTC there, then here. Any problems with that route? <br />To withdraw, which I have never done ;), I would send it back to gox through bitinstant, then from gox to another account, then to my bank.<br /><br />that whole Socket not loading thing has always been there for me, have never been able to buy instant like that, but I have put orders up...for less than current x-rate, and still had BTC within 5 minutes.

				that socket problem started a month ago for me - on and off, but about two weeks ago I emailed TH and they got to me right away, as they&#039;ve always done replying to my emails - like within a day. Then I haven&#039;t seen it work once for more than week - using FF or IE. They said to just put in a Bid/Buy price and the few times I did that (I was close to asking price) I got my BTC within a few minutes of placing that order. <br /><br />I emailed TH the other day re no more bank wire transfers and still have not heard back from them.<br /><br />I have less than $1 in my account and I am washing my hands of TH as of now.<br /><br />TH is all I have used since I started buying BTC for SR. Now I figure I have two options to get BTC now (and I have a few things I need to order soon, so I need my BTC like yesterday).<br /><br />1) use another service like TH - like Mt.Gox or Campbx<br /><br />2) Moneypaks. Using one of the top three MP-to-BTC Vendors on SR.<br /><br />I hope TH isn&#039;t playing funny games, as I know some people have funds tied up with them - I wish those guys/gals good luck and hope no one looses any money.

				This whole thing reeks. Even if Trade Hill doesn&#039;t turn out to be a scam (which I kinda/sorta doubt) and this guy does get his money back, I am apprehensive of this whole BTC =&gt; Real Money thing. I&#039;ve been reading the bitcoin forums and TH&#039;s blog, and it seems a lot of TH withdrawal methods have stopped working...missing/extremely late checks, suspended bank wire transfers, and OKPay/Paxum Transfers (which are the only two methods of withdrawing USD at the moment from TH) have been delayed for a couple of days. As a vendor, if I have a $2000 in BTC and want to convert it into cash I can&#039;t afford to wait 2-3 weeks to get my cash (this is in addition to waiting a couple of days for my customers to receive my product and finalize).<br /><br />The only really legit exchange I see besides TH is Mt. Gox. As for the other exchanges like Crypto X, I personally have a hard time trusting them because they almost seem like they could be potential scams in the future. What&#039;s really stopping them? Or, they could be really incompetent, like TH is proving itself to be right now. Neither is good for business, especially this one. If TH falls, (which I doubt it will, just speculating, one may never be to sure of anything really, no offense to anyone here), it will be a blow to the BTC community, but one that I believe it would recover from. If Mt. Gox was to ever fall, then (correct me if I&#039;m wrong, please) the BTC community would be on life support. That&#039;s why I think that Mt. Gox is the safest bet to put my Bitcoins.<br /><br />The only solution I see for myself as a vendor in order to withdraw my funds into real life currency is to set up a bunch of fake Mt. Gox accounts, and breaking up my BTC into smaller increments and sending them to those accounts. And then from there exchange the BTC into USD and send that also into increments of less than $500 to different bank accounts using Dwolla or LR. <br /><br />I really don&#039;t want to have to show my ID or a proof of address to Mt. Gox if they freeze an account, or god forbid all of them. How do I not arouse their suspicion? <br /><br />Dear SR users, do any of you have suggestions for my case?
