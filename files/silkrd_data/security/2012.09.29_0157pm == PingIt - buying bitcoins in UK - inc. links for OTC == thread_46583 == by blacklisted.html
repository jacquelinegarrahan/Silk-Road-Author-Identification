				Hi.<br /><br />With MTGOX down for UK deposits, here&#039;s an alternative that isn&#039;t too harsh on the charges.<br />Once set up, transfer take approx 1-3 hours.<br /><br />***Beware, this method isn&#039;t completely *anonymous*, it&#039;s similar to MTGox, you give sensitive &amp; personal information to PingIt and also to Blockchain. Use with great caution.*** <br /><br />At this time, My personal use with PingIt is for uncontrolled substances and so I feel at ease with it, for now! <br />For more Risky items and services on here it may be better to look for better and safer alternatives - see below after the 10-point guide.<br /><br />FOR PINGIT.. you should have a smartphone, a current account, internet banking, a &#039;https://blockchain.info/&#039; wallet and a relaxed attitude to your details being used up until the point of stepping stone transfers (instawallets etc). For this tutorial, I&#039;m assuming everyone has ticked those boxes.<br /><br />1. Download Barclays Ping-it app to android or iPhone. and get to a PC and open up https://blockchain.info/<br /><br />2. Set up Ping-it. This is the time consuming part, the app sets up an account with Barclays to use (Barclays may ask you to go to the bank to verify, otherwise it&#039;s all done in the app). Run through the steps and then they&#039;ll send 1 pence to your current account that will show up quickly, the code to verify will show up next working day, possibly the day after.<br /><br />3. Now, while we&#039;re waiting for Ping-it&#039;s code to be sent to current account...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Set up a wallet at https://blockchain.info/ .. go to webpage, click on top tab &#039;wallet&#039;, click &#039;start a new wallet&#039; .. set it up! Get familiar with site, log in, check out the options etc.. once logged into wallet, you&#039;ll see 3 blue buttons together to the right, for this tutorial, we&#039;re using the middle one &#039;ping-it deposit&#039;.<br /><br />4. code will appear with 1p deposit 1-2days later in your current account --- type verification code into the Ping-it app and you&#039;re now set up ready to transfer. <br /><br />5. Add funds TO the Ping-it app by using your current accounts&#039; internet banking transfer options. It&#039;s the same as simply sending money to another account from your current account, the details for the Barclays account to send to show up on the app&#039;s front page, you can click on &#039;TOP UP&#039; in the app for a brief&nbsp; &#039;how to&#039;, including a way to deposit funds via an ATM.<br /><br />5. Funds will appear in Ping-it within minutes. (it did for me, anyway) Now, you can send these funds to your wallet at&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/<br /><br />6. Open up https://blockchain.info/ and open up Ping-it app. Log in to your wallet on blockchain, and click on the Pingit deposit blue button and you&#039;ll see a pop up. Type in the amount of funds you want to transfer to blockchain from Pingit, click continue and the pop up with change to show information you need to type into ping-it. It will give you a reference, the amount and how many bitcoins you will get. ALSO, below that is instructions you will follow using your Ping-it app.<br /><br />7. Now, in Ping-it, go to PAY tab at the top and type in the phone number given at blockchain, below that put the reference number into the &#039;msg&#039; box and then type in the funds you want to transfer.<br /><br />8. Now click on REVIEW PAYMENT and make sure you&#039;ve put in all details correctly. &lt;&lt;&lt; double check. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />9. send funds. they&#039;ll appear at blockchain within minutes.<br /><br />10. Finally, we&#039;re ready to transfer to SR. I don&#039;t transfer straight there, I send to a temporary wallet first and THEN onto SR. Id recommend using instwallet or easywallet... I tend to just use the one stepping stone, but use as many as you like, to and from multiple wallets and THEN to SR&#039;s bitcoin address.<br /><br />--- Remember to save the stepping stone wallet&#039;s URL&#039;s, bookmark it or save URL as a text file for now as if lost, or something goes wrong with your PC then you could LOSE all those wonderful BTC&#039;s. Finally use a NEW wallet for each new transfer.---<br /><br />MY LAST BTC PURCHASE WORKED OUT TO BE...&nbsp; 1 BTC = Â£7.70 using the PingIt/Blockchain method<br /><br />Once set up, I estimate the total time for funds to get to SR is about 1-3hrs.<br />____________________________________________________________<br />************************************************************<br /><br /><br />There are alternatives for those seeking more anonymity, check out the following (supplied by PINE)..<br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com&nbsp; <br />http://www.tradebitcoin.com<br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />I&#039;ve yet to try these out, they appear to involve more effort, but ultimately, let&#039;s all stay under the Radar!!! do your homework, research, google, ask in forums etc. I WILL be trying these out myself at some point, will update as I go.<br /><br /><br />END!<br />If anyone has something to add, or if you&#039;ve noticed an error I should edit, please PM ME.<br /><br />Blacklisted

				I&#039;ve thus far had a good experience with the Ping-it method also.&nbsp; Maybe I was lucky but for me the verification with the penny transfer took only a minute or two when I first set it up even though I&#039;m not with Barclays.&nbsp; I used an ATM to put money in the pingit wallet instead of waiting for a transfer which probably would have taken an hour or two longer.&nbsp; Then I just sent the money from the Ping-it wallet to blockchain where the bitcoins appeared in the wallet in another minute or two.&nbsp; The whole process was extremely fast and I had the coins on SR much sooner than I expected, and at pretty much the same price I would have paid for them on MtGox with the old UK bank transfer method.&nbsp; Only problem I ran into initially was with the app itself, for some reason I had to go through the installation/sign up a few times before it recognized my password when I started the app afterwards, even though I was inputting it correctly.&nbsp; I hope this service doesn&#039;t start charging higher fees, because right now I feel it is a very convenient alternative and it&#039;s also neat to be able to obtain bitcoins so fast without having to wait even a day.

				This sounds great. Thanks for the detailed guide blacklisted.<br /><br />Will be sure to give this method a go as soon as my memory card for my new phone arrives (can&#039;t install any new apps :s).<br /><br />None of you have any idea of a work around the meantime where you could just do it all through your PC some how?

				I sent some money to my blockchain wallet last night and they still haven&#039;t shown up yet. I&#039;ve also messaged their support desk this morning and haven&#039;t had a reply. Someone said on the other thread his had taken 18 hours but i&#039;m at 24 now and getting worried.<br /><br />Should i take action against them yet?

				Hi,<br /><br />Can any one help me with a quick question on this please - The 1p has been credited into my account. However, there is no verification code showing up when I log on to online bank statement. Where it usually says who sent money to me or where I&#039;ve spent money i.e. the supermarket, all it says next to the 1p is &#039;NO REF&quot;<br /><br />So where you all get the 1p verification code from?<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks in advance&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />J.

				Hi Jap, Used this method myself. <br />The 1p is credited almost immediately, but the reference will take up to 48hr to show up on your online statement I think. <br /><br />Cheers.

OH NO ! this morning when i woke up it was there, so i cracked on put it in and decided i would do the transfer so that hopefully it would get there by tuesday. Again OH NO, it was instant and so was sending the money from ping it to blockchain. I was so impressed i sat for 10 mkins sending money about, i really am amased that its a sunday and i can send money about :D <br />So now im just waiting for the funds to reach SR from blokchain. If it get there today i will be well happy.<br /><br />All in all a very good experience, in a way im glad Mtgox fucked up !!!

				Just had an email from blockchain support and they admitted there&#039;s a software problem on integration between pingit and blockchain. They said though the majority of transactions are going through ok there are three other people in the same boat as me. They said the owner is back on the 5th and asked me to be patient till then. To be honest i&#039;ll be royally pissed off if they think this is ok. If my money isn&#039;t there or returned in the morning then i&#039;ll take action

				Hi Pine, it&#039;s True, I am relatively new to site, and yes my post count is low. However, I do wish to use site safely and improve my way&#039;s as I go. I appreciate the concern, can you provide an alternative to PingIt/MTGox type methods for bitcoins?<br /><br />in my first post i put &#039;only use if you have a relaxed attitude to your details being used&#039;, at least up to the point of stepping stone transfers via wallets. This PingIt method and the MTGox method is the only way I&#039;ve found ideal for me to do the BTC purchasing and transferring. <br /><br />If you have a better way, please let me know, as at the moment I find PingIt to be the best way for me. I used MTGox hassle free until they blocked uk deposits and with that I even had to verify my account too, it didn&#039;t seem an issue.<br />Ive taken a look at localbitcoin options and although they do appear more anonymous, I don&#039;t want to have to meet someone that&#039;s 30+ miles away.<br /><br />I understand that BTC&#039;s can be a suspicious thing but once we have BTC&#039;s at, say, Blockchain ... doesn&#039;t the jumping through instawallets etc lose the trail?<br />Also, should we be using instawallets via the TOR browser, or does that not really matter.<br /><br />if the PingIt method ive mentioned rings loud alarm bells for you, please lead us to a better, safer option.. It could help me and others.<br /><br />Thanks for your time, I&#039;ve seen many of your posts and I hold you in high regard on here :)<br /><br />[EDIT] --- for DiscreteCat ... I PM&#039;d you, I also got the P2001 error and I believe I know WHY you got yours.. (see PM)<br />

This will mean instead of using central exchanges which are prone to being subpoenaed, closed down, targeted by hackers, or otherwise a bottleneck in obtaining BTC and not usually a cheap one at that, you are essentially acquiring bitcoins from other people directly in exchange for any payment service they are happy to be paid in.<br /><br />This provides more payment flexibility. This provides far more anonymity. Since vendors have a easier way to cash out, this may even ultimately mean the transaction cost is lower than the hurdles you must go through today with exchanges if you wish to remain anonymous (e.g. if you use Tor with MtGox, you get red flagged, so it becomes a pain in the ass to be anonymous using it because you have to setup a proxy). <br /><br />Examples of these OTC worldwide services:<br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com&nbsp; Note: There are no fees charged period last time I checked. This may appear formidable at first, but do your homework you won&#039;t regret it, this will be time saver.<br />http://www.tradebitcoin.com <br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />The next ones I&#039;m listing are not OTC, but they are compelling because they allow cash deposits (anonymous entry to bitcoin because cash deposits don&#039;t require ID, and even if they do, which is super rare, they&#039;ve nothing to make a comparison to if you have fake ID anyway). Cash deposits and CIM are the only way I would deal with exchanges.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t mentioned them before because I haven&#039;t checked them out thoroughly so you&#039;ll have to do your own homework but they are:<br /><br />http://bitcoinme.com/index.php/buy/<br /><br />If you are in Australia this looks great, cash deposits at 4 different bank branches available:<br /><br />https://www.spendbitcoins.com/buy/<br /><br />And similarly this:<br /><br />https://www.omnicoins.com/<br /><br />For New Zealand:<br /><br />http://coinmarket.co.nz/buy/<br /><br />For USA, Aus, NZ:<br /><br />https://www.mrbitcoins.com/<br /><br />If you are getting stuck, you can use https://www.virwox.com/ with which you&#039;ll acquire Linden dollars and then sell it for Bitcoins. I&#039;d be interested in hearing feedback from anybody who&#039;s tried this since it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve done myself. Seems like a very practical way if cash deposits + CIM get outlawed and there are no OTC arrangements to back you up.<br /><br />That means if the US government tried to ban bitcoin, they would have to ban every virtual currency in existence as well and/or make all vidya that use in-game currencies subject to AML regulations. Lulz. That is literally impossible. People will be like: I&#039;m an orc, fuck you.<br /><br />Some help for our UK comrades since cash deposits in UK have been drying up lately.<br /><br />https://londonbitcoinexchange.wordpress.com/ (cash deposit)<br />http://www.BitcoinNordic.com (CIM)<br /><br />Alternatively you can use Virwox (virtual currency) or https://www.wm-center.com/ (&#039;real&#039; virtual currency) where you will acquire a virtual currency and then exchange that for B$.<br />--<br /><br /><br />My opinion is that one should try the OTC methods first, because they are the best for your security and once you understand it it&#039;s easier than using the other methods (it&#039;s like learning PGP, a one time investment and then you&#039;re good to go forever). <br /><br />The most important thing with OTC is scams. You need to pay very close attention to the various reputation systems, just as you do on SR, if there is escrow services possible (not currently) then you need to be using those for sure. So using OTC requires you to keep your wits about you.<br /><br />If OTC doesn&#039;t work out for you, there are cash deposits or CIM.

However, I do wish to use site safely and improve my way&#039;s as I go. I appreciate the concern, can you provide an alternative to PingIt/MTGox type methods for bitcoins?<br /><br />in my first post i put &#039;only use if you have a relaxed attitude to your details being used&#039;, at least up to the point of stepping stone transfers via wallets. This PingIt method and the MTGox method is the only way I&#039;ve found ideal for me to do the BTC purchasing and transferring. <br /><br />If you have a better way, please let me know, as at the moment I find PingIt to be the best way for me. I used MTGox hassle free until they blocked uk deposits and with that I even had to verify my account too, it didn&#039;t seem an issue.<br />Ive taken a look at localbitcoin options and although they do appear more anonymous, I don&#039;t want to have to meet someone that&#039;s 30+ miles away.<br /><br />I understand that BTC&#039;s can be a suspicious thing but once we have BTC&#039;s at, say, Blockchain ... doesn&#039;t the jumping through instawallets etc lose the trail?<br />Also, should we be using instawallets via the TOR browser, or does that not really matter.<br /><br />if the PingIt method ive mentioned rings loud alarm bells for you, please lead us to a better, safer option.. It could help me and others.<br /><br />Thanks for your time, I&#039;ve seen many of your posts and I hold you in high regard on here :)<br /><br />[EDIT] --- for DiscreteCat ... I PM&#039;d you, I also got the P2001 error and I believe I know WHY you got yours.. (see PM)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />A safer more secure option is to use OTC or over the counter exchange. This will mean instead of using central exchanges which are prone to being subpoenaed, closed down, targeted by hackers, or otherwise a bottleneck in obtaining BTC and not usually a cheap one at that, you are essentially acquiring bitcoins from other people directly in exchange for any payment service they are happy to be paid in.<br /><br />This provides more payment flexibility. This provides far more anonymity. Since vendors have a easier way to cash out, this may even ultimately mean the transaction cost is lower than the hurdles you must go through today with exchanges if you wish to remain anonymous (e.g. if you use Tor with MtGox, you get red flagged, so it becomes a pain in the ass to be anonymous using it because you have to setup a proxy). <br /><br />Examples of these OTC worldwide services:<br /><br />http://bitcoin-otc.com&nbsp; Note: There are no fees charged period last time I checked. This may appear formidable at first, but do your homework you won&#039;t regret it, this will be time saver.<br />http://www.tradebitcoin.com <br />https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />The next ones I&#039;m listing are not OTC, but they are compelling because they allow cash deposits (anonymous entry to bitcoin because cash deposits don&#039;t require ID, and even if they do, which is super rare, they&#039;ve nothing to make a comparison to if you have fake ID anyway). Cash deposits and CIM are the only way I would deal with exchanges.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t mentioned them before because I haven&#039;t checked them out thoroughly so you&#039;ll have to do your own homework but they are:<br /><br />http://bitcoinme.com/index.php/buy/<br /><br />If you are in Australia this looks great, cash deposits at 4 different bank branches available:<br /><br />https://www.spendbitcoins.com/buy/<br /><br />And similarly this:<br /><br />https://www.omnicoins.com/<br /><br />For New Zealand:<br /><br />http://coinmarket.co.nz/buy/<br /><br />For USA, Aus, NZ:<br /><br />https://www.mrbitcoins.com/<br /><br />If you are getting stuck, you can use https://www.virwox.com/ with which you&#039;ll acquire Linden dollars and then sell it for Bitcoins. I&#039;d be interested in hearing feedback from anybody who&#039;s tried this since it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve done myself. Seems like a very practical way if cash deposits + CIM get outlawed and there are no OTC arrangements to back you up.<br /><br />That means if the US government tried to ban bitcoin, they would have to ban every virtual currency in existence as well and/or make all vidya that use in-game currencies subject to AML regulations. Lulz. That is literally impossible. People will be like: I&#039;m an orc, fuck you.<br /><br />Some help for our UK comrades since cash deposits in UK have been drying up lately.<br /><br />https://londonbitcoinexchange.wordpress.com/ (cash deposit)<br />http://www.BitcoinNordic.com (CIM)<br /><br />Alternatively you can use Virwox (virtual currency) or https://www.wm-center.com/ (&#039;real&#039; virtual currency) where you will acquire a virtual currency and then exchange that for B$.<br />--<br /><br /><br />My opinion is that one should try the OTC methods first, because they are the best for your security and once you understand it it&#039;s easier than using the other methods (it&#039;s like learning PGP, a one time investment and then you&#039;re good to go forever). <br /><br />The most important thing with OTC is scams. You need to pay very close attention to the various reputation systems, just as you do on SR, if there is escrow services possible (not currently) then you need to be using those for sure. So using OTC requires you to keep your wits about you.<br /><br />If OTC doesn&#039;t work out for you, there are cash deposits or CIM. And if that doesn&#039;t work out there are virtual currency exchanges. There are always options.<br /><br />In fact there is an entire universe of payment possibilities. LE are trying to close them down, starting with the exchanges, but they shall fail, they have never faced an enemy this amorphous before. The online market is tiny, tiny in comparison of the overall illegal product market, but the quantity of brainpower going into making dead ends for LE is overwhelmingly disproportionate.

Lots of flexible methods! :)<br /><br />It is glorious really. Behold the glorious revolution. And it&#039;s going to get better still once I get going with my scary plan No.7.<br /><br />I would like some feature of SRF where people can submit trip reports in some organized format, like Erowid&#039;s idea, but more rigorous and detailed. If that was setup, then it would be easy to have a &#039;buy bitcoin report&#039; in a similar way to the trip report forms, and then the million and one ways to obtain bitcoin could be described, making it more user friend for newbs than trawling through the forums for info.<br /><br />I know how everybody is like &quot;ZOMG, drugs on the internet, can I haz yesterday?&quot; and that&#039;s a perfectly reasonable response to SR, but for your own sake you all have to take a breather and do it properly, and properly = anonymously.<br /><br />There are two forms of anonymity with bitcoin, what I call two-factor anonymity if you&#039;re interested in being completely 100% anonymous.<br /><br />1. Physical anonymity. Preventing the acquisition of bitcoins being linked to you.<br /><br />For buyers, this is where you obtain your bitcoins anonymous in the first place. CIM, cash deposit at banks, OTC and using other virtual currencies as an intermediates can achieve this but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of other methods e.g. debit cards, ukash, being in a mining pool and probably hundreds of other methods.<br /><br />Although these methods can be anonymous, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t screw it up e.g. you are at the bank making a deposit and the teller recognizes you since this is also your normal bank, so think it through step by step.<br /><br />2. Virtual anonymity. Preventing the use of bitcoins for your illegal purchases being traced back to you.<br /><br />This is where you become anonymous on the block chain itself. All transactions in bitcoin are publicly available. This is a great strength and a great caveat. Anonymity is achieved by the use of mixers. The most famous mixers are bitcoin laundry and bitcoin fog, but I see others called cleanbit and blockchain. The exchanges and online bitcoin wallets themselves may act as pools where you&#039;ll recieve different bitcoins to the ones you put in, but you don&#039;t know whether they&#039;re keeping a record of that stuff. The basic idea is that you put in your bitcoins into the system and you receive somebody else&#039;s bitcoins. Now those bitcoins may or may not have been acquired anonymously, but the point is that they were acquired by somebody else and not yourself.<br /><br />In the future there will be anonymity solutions like open transactions, blind signature mixers and ripple transactions and such that make virtual anonymity easier and far more difficult to unravel. But for now it&#039;s a paying proposition.<br /><br />Please note that you&#039;re dealing with 3rd parties here. All those mixers I mentioned could just steal your money. In addition, if they keep records of the transactions like a honeypot would, then mixing is completely pointless. There are solutions to these problems on the horizon. In the meantime do the smart thing and;<br /><br />A: Search forums and google for references to these services. Are they any good? Or scams?<br />B: Test your deposits into a mixer by using small quantities, or/and dividing up your deposits among several mixers.<br />C: Always send bitcoins to OTA or One Time Addresses. Never use the same bitcoin address twice. Ever.<br /><br />Ultimately if you do Physical Anonymity + Virtual Anonymity, then you&#039;re very very unlikely to get busted for buying product via the use of the bitcoin network. More importantly perhaps, using both methods means if you goof up somewhere somehow, then the other &#039;anonymity factor&#039; covers your ass. It&#039;s nice to be smart all the time, but it&#039;s better to be really smart and make a Plan B for your fucking up instead of expecting perfection from yourself. Also being smart all the time is impossible so that leaves...<br /><br />

				Thanks pine for all your posts explaining how to use local bitcoin exchangers and such, very informative.&nbsp; Now that I know I don&#039;t have to actually drive a hundred miles to meet some guy I am definitely going to be using those methods in the future for all my bitcoin purchases.&nbsp; It is definitely a better option than having a bank keep a record of every time you send money to some sketchy phone number or sending money to a service that openly sells bitcoins on a large scale, like MtGox.
