If you open that file, you&#039;ll find your public key block there.

				The most important thing you can do to keep from getting scammed is to only buy using escrow.&nbsp; Do not finalize early.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the explanations. <br /><br />Another question: When I exchange bitcoins, I guess I have to go first; how do I avoid getting scammed here? <br /><br />Also, what is finalizing? What happens if I don&#039;t finalize? Is there some kind of guide how it all goes or can somebody explain?

				Finalizing is when you send the money from escrow to your vendor. If you don&#039;t finalize, it&#039;ll happen automatically after some time but that means your vendor will have floated you drugs without compensation for three weeks (which will probably rightfully annoy them).

				Thanks for the answer QTC.<br /><br />Does anybody know a good site where I can buy bitcoins? I am from Sweden.
