				So I had a complete hard drive failure.&nbsp; My bitcoin program was on that hard drive with nearly $500 worth of bitcoins.&nbsp; I realize now that I should have made a copy of wallet.dat for safekeeping and stuck it on a different drive, but I was too much of a noob to take this precaution (note to the rest of you: do this).&nbsp; <br /><br />The very weird part about it is my hard drive failed on the same day that account with 500k bitcoins was compromised and the market crashed.&nbsp; This makes me think it may have been somehow compromised and my coins may have been stolen.<br /><br />The hard drive is not recognized by my computer.&nbsp; It will not even acknowledge it as hooked up but I can still hear the platters spinning.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know of a way to get my hard drive up and running well enough to at least transfer my wallet.dat out of it?&nbsp; Any way that bitcoin account can somehow be recovered that you guys know of?<br /><br />God, I&#039;d hate to think that I&#039;m out of $500 worth of bitcoins and no way to recover them.....<br /><br /><br />Any input?

				Try running some data recovery software, preferably from a live bootable CD or something. Past that, you&#039;re pretty fucked.

				If the hard-drive is spinning up but not being recognized by the BIOS, try leaving the drive in the freezer for a few hours, then plugging it back into the PC.&nbsp; It&#039;s been known to work in the past.

				I&#039;d second the freezer idea.&nbsp; It&#039;s worked for me with entire computers before, so it may work with a dodgy integrated controller board (which is what this sounds like).&nbsp; Otherwise, you&#039;ll need to to go (or ship) to a data recovery service and those aren&#039;t at all cheap.

				You can also do a 4-6 hour drive fix with the program SpinRite - good luck !

				You could try getting it recovered by a professional service, if you can find one on the cheap. I&#039;m not sure how cost effective that is though.
