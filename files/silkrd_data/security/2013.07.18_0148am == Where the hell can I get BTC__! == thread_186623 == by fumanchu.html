				What are you guys doing for coins currently?<br /><br />BitInstant is down... Blue Sky Traders are out of stock, CoinMama&#039;s out of stock, BTC-Brokers is not an option because they require account validation which can take several days (I think? Their website is shitty as hell, confusing, and unprofessional) . CoinBase requires a waiting period of like a week or something, which is not an option. There used to be a place called get-bitcoin.com back in the day, but I can&#039;t seem to find it so I assume they&#039;re no longer in business...<br /><br />So where does this leave me? What other options do I have? I know theres gotta be a lot more BTC exchanges out there... I&#039;m looking for an instant exchange for USD to BTC (meaning not more than a few hours until coins are deposited), and I can do it at Bank of America, but NOT Chase or Wells Fargo because theres no Chase or Wells Fargo within roughly 100 miles from here..<br /><br />So lay it on me folks, where&#039;s the coins at these days?!<br /><br />

Also campbx.com, if you don&#039;t mind the snail mail wait and the not really anonymous protocol. But hey, what do ya want, true bitcoin purchase anonymity is a thing of the past, except maybe with localbitcoins. And even here that only goes as far as meeting face to face, and some vendors require some kind of validation (sms).
