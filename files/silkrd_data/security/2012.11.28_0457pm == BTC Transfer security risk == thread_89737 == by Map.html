				i&#039;ve had several users today ask me if they can pay for their orders with bitcoin transfers as opposed to through escrow<br /><br />obviously i&#039;ll not be conducting my business outside SR&#039;s escrow system , but i&#039;m concerned there&#039;s a security flaw that could mean if these people are law enforcement , they could be using this to track my btc/identity.<br /><br />is this just me being paranoid, or is this something i should be concerned about?<br /><br />thanks<br />Map

				I respond to those questions by explaining that this place is too amazing to not give DPR his cut.<br /><br />Receiving bitcoins directly is not a security threat in itself, but could be if they can connect that address to your identity. An easy way around this is a coin tumbling service. For example: Bitcoin Fog.

				LE could send you coins and if you&#039;re using the desktop client, watch to see where the transaction spending these coins originates from. If you&#039;re sending payments using the desktop client then you should disable UPnP and connect to TOR via the socks proxy settings. If you&#039;re using an online wallet then you should only visit it through TOR and in either case the first thing you should do is send to a mixer.

				It&#039;s a little bit more volatile than the responses have made it out to be, as far as I know.&nbsp; Now I don&#039;t claim to have written the software or understand its workings intimately, mind you, but as I understand it the situation is this: if they can track a single coin from a known point of origin anywhere, whether it&#039;s tomorrow or the next decade, they can directly and mathematically prove that you&#039;re tied to the activities you don&#039;t want to be tied to.<br /><br />The problem is that if anywhere along the way they manage to find out who someone is, then from that point on if all the coins aren&#039;t sufficiently dispersed and mixed and all that, it&#039;s just following a trail of transactions right up to your bank account -- I don&#039;t have the problem of cashing out as a buyer, so I don&#039;t know too well how you guys end up doing it, but at some point somewhere along the way you have to turn those things into cash and I doubt you&#039;re doing it by meeting up with local bitcoiners every Sunday and selling them a few thousand dollars worth of coins anonymously without raising an eyebrow.<br /><br />You&#039;re not being irrationally paranoid.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that they could find you by transferring directly to a bitcoin address that you then turn into cash without sufficient mixing.&nbsp; This part is total conjecture on my end, but I imagine it&#039;s basically a matter of the coins having to criss-cross each other&#039;s trail so many times with so many branches that even a computer can no longer sufficiently calculate where it ended up (because there end up being thousands of possibilities for each coin branching off like moves in a chess game).&nbsp; But again, that&#039;s just my silly picture of it, I could be off by a whole lot.&nbsp; It does kind of give you an idea of how &quot;not as anonymous as we think,&quot; Bitcoins really are.<br /><br />I&#039;ll say this though: for some reason, even though I do sometimes run the client software myself, I&#039;ve never had my IP show up in the blockchain (and I don&#039;t always go through Tor).&nbsp; I like Bitcoins for their own sake.&nbsp; Anyway, for some reason I&#039;ve never been the one first reporting a transaction, which makes no sense to me at all... because if I don&#039;t report it first, then who the fuck could -- I&#039;m the one who sent the damn things.&nbsp; That makes little sense to me, so my understanding is obviously flawed somewhere or other.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to be schooled if anybody wants to spare the time :)

If you&#039;re not connected you can bet one of your peers is, so as far as blockchain know the peer who sent it to them is the originator instead.

So it&#039;s safe to assume someone is and that they&#039;re your enemy.

				so, i&#039;m sure there&#039;s a list of posts about this already, but the safest way to use btc is only use online wallets with tor and mix before withdrawal ?<br />(or to be really safe and avoid prison completely , don&#039;t use SR in the first place .....but where&#039;s the fun in that ?)<br /><br />what&#039;s the best way to mix properly ?<br /><br />is there a reputable site?<br /><br />Map
