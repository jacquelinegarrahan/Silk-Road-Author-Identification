				Here&#039;s my thread asking for help. It&#039;s time for me to step my game up. For all I know I could get my house raided tomorrow. I would like Tor and all my PGP stuff on a flash drive. I&#039;ve read through other threads but they don&#039;t have exactly what I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;m not very tech savvy so I kind of need my hand held here. Everybody is welcome to chime in but I ask that you keep it as relevant as possible. I know there&#039;s not just one way to do things like this so please try to include why you suggest one way over another when possible. I&#039;d rather learn this way than do a bunch of clearnet research and leave a trail, you know?<br /><br />Assuming the declining value of BTC doesn&#039;t take all my fucking money (lol), I&#039;m willing to make a small donation to the most helpful person(s).<br /><br />Let&#039;s start. <br />1. My desktop is Windows Vista. I may be getting a laptop soon and there&#039;s a decent chance it&#039;ll be a Mac. <br />2. I currently have two thumb drives available. One has 986 MB of storage and one has 1.95 GB. I&#039;d prefer to use the 986 MB one because it&#039;s so small but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;ll be enough space. <br />3. Do I want TAILS, Liberte (or whatever its called), or something else?

				The 1GB USB stick should be more than enough to run Tails on and have a small persistent volume left for your personal files.<br />The tutorial that Libertas posted seems to be very well laid out and shouldn&#039;t give you too many troubles. :)

				Use tails if you want. Someone already posted the tutorial. If you can&#039;t get it to work just download and install trucrypt onto your usb. Then create new volumes and download tor and gpg4usb into them. Or just use tails

If u need help, Msg me, i can tell u everything iv done to my flash drive.. <br /><br />Iv got mine to where it will only work if a 20 letter password is put in, if u turn on the comp an try to access my flash drive it says nothing at all is on it.. <br /><br />there is another good thing for make your thumb drive safe also. called Diskcryptor..

				Tails is dead simple as long as you can follow instructions.&nbsp; There are threads on here about setting up Tails and then setting up Electrum bitcoin wallet within Tails - just follow the instructions carefully and it will work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tails has all the Tor and PGP support you need built into it.&nbsp; So, with Tails+Electrum, you can have a setup where everything you&#039;ll ever need for SR is on a flash drive, and there will be no trace left anywhere else besides the flash drive.&nbsp; Be sure to backup your Electrum wallet if you keep any BTC in there so that you can &quot;destroy&quot; the flash drive if you ever need to without losing money.<br /><br />Tails will work on a relatively old POS computer that you could buy for next to nothing.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even need a hard drive in it.

				I enjoy the feel of Liberte, but to each their own. In other words, I started with Liberte, and I like it. However, Liberte allows permanent storage of files, whereas Tails is very, very clean. Each boot on Tails is new, fresh from the last use--no history, no files, etc.<br /><br />Allow me to change my position. For the ease of use and lack of footprints, Tails is probably the better option. As far as Tails goes, I have a blockchain account, in addition to bitcoin-qt (on another OS). Blockchain seems to be pretty solid. Alternatively, I have been sending my cash--&gt;BTC straight to my SR acct, so there hasn&#039;t been much need for a wallet lately.<br /><br />I actually had a few hiccups loading tails via Linux, so I used UUI (universal usb installer) on a Windows PC. After a few direct downloads and mistrials, I downloaded the torrent--much faster, in my case--than the direct download offered by tails.boum.org. 0.18 is the current version, and they are currently testing 0.19.<br /><br />Hope that helps,<br />PET
