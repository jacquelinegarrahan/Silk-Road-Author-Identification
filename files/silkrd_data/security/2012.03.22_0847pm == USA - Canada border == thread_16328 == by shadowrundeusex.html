				I&#039;ve been wanting to get that rave experience but it seems that nothing happens in the USA unless you live n NYC or another massively large city. The closest place to me that has anything decent going on is in Canada. I&#039;ve never been out of the country before so I thought I&#039;d ask what I need to worry about at the border.<br /><br />What do I need to worry about? How do I get across with my personal supply? What precautions should I take? Thanks!

				I am not sure what city you live in, but every place that is reasonably close to a city in Canada with a good scene has a great rave scene. In fact, every border state with a major city has a functioning rave scene. Seattle, Minneapolis, Madison, Chicago, Detroit, past New York state you may be screwed, but Boston has a functioning scene. I think you need to look harder, hit some rave forums (filled with kids but will eventually send you on the right track), or PM me.<br /><br />If getting in a plane or driving 6 hours is your style there are so many places in the US to go. Pro tip: Never cross a international border with drugs or illegal items in your possession. Better to mail them to your hotel ahead of time (after making arrangements with them).

				A friend of mine loves raves for some reason and gets all his info from meetup.com. There are &quot;underground party&quot; groups for my city and probably others. I have another amateur DJ friend on facebook who always plays at these things, so I get invites seemingly everyday.<br /><br />But that doesn&#039;t really answer anything about the border. I don&#039;t have much experience. But here&#039;s one just for entertainment.<br /><br />I was crossing the border via Greyhound and fell asleep on the ride. I woke up just as we got to the border station, where we all had to get off the bus and have our bags scanned and ID&#039;s checked and whatnot. I was really chill from just having a nice nap. This border cop saw how laid back I was and was like, &quot;hey, this is serious you know!&quot; He took me aside and asked me questions while typing shit into a computer. Meanwhile, everyone else is either back on the bus or getting their luggage scanned. The cop lets me go, but the funny thing was, they never checked my bag. I actually had a bunch of herbs (legal) in my luggage that would definitely have given them reason to turn me away, or worse. It was actually their suspicion of me that got me through. <br /><br />Possibly useful: I tried to cross from Canada to the US again recently and they were again super suspicious of me for some reason. I keep a pretty clean nose, I don&#039;t know why my luck is so bad. I was kept there for about an hour while they did god-knows-what on their computers. They scanned my fingerprints 3 times. I had every piece of documentation they could possibly want, birth certificate, passport (brand new), ID. They turned me away because they wanted proof of where I got my income or something. So consider bringing your most recent tax return or the like.<br /><br />In the second case I was again, very calm and cool, well dressed and groomed, it&#039;s almost like they pick on the ones who aren&#039;t afraid of them. They also searched my backpack, but didn&#039;t find the knife in the front pocket that I forgot I had (a friend left it at my house, I don&#039;t own any weapons)! All together, I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m lucky or unlucky.

				It all depends where you are crossing the border, if your really worried use a larger checkpoint at peak hours as long as you don&#039;t give them a reason to look at you twice you&#039;ll be fine. You&#039;re just another American tourist looking to experience the wonders of Canada 8)<br /><br />P.S if your near any large American city there is a scene you just might have to look a little harder, if you are new to an area go to a couple of &quot;ravey&quot; shows at legal venues, talk to some people, make some friends you&#039;ll find whatever you need :)

				DON&#039;T FUCK WITH THE BORDER BROTHER!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about anyone else, but that&#039;s my two cents, don&#039;t mess with the border, get what you need to get when you&#039;re in Canada, or get what you need to get when you&#039;re in the USA, but don&#039;t try and bring something over from one place to other.&nbsp; Border cops are the worst, the absolute worst.&nbsp; You can bet on having your car tossed.&nbsp; You might even get denied entry.&nbsp; If you have a record, even for something really small, they WILL just turn you away, and then they check you again on your way back!&nbsp; So...&nbsp; Here&#039;s my suggestions: don&#039;t be carrying, have your destination/plans/itinerary printed out and ready to show the pigs (including and especially when you plan on returning, where you&#039;ll be staying, etc.), be as clean/well-dressed/presentable as you can possibly be, and again, don&#039;t be carrying!&nbsp; Border pigs are an especially wretched breed of pig, and that&#039;s saying something...&nbsp; SWIM has been hassled many a time by the border pigs, never underestimate the border pigs.&nbsp; Other than that...&nbsp; Canada is great, Montreal is a great city, but then so are Vancouver and Toronto.&nbsp; Have fun, and say &quot;Hello&quot; to Ricky, Julian and Bubbles for me.

				It would be going to Toronto from New York state. I&#039;d probably be carrying a gram of mdma vacuum sealed or some rolls. Maybe acid, 2Cs, or other MDXX on other trips. I could hide it easily inside of anything. Maybe a laptop, a game system, or a dvd case?<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll just take a trip to the zoo and sneak in something legal like a tiny baggie of caffeine to see what it&#039;s like. <br /><br />If I could actually find something decent in my area that doesn&#039;t play dubstep &quot;wob wob&quot;s, I wouldn&#039;t even bother with Canada.

				The border knows all about the fake bible on the dash full of drugs, the open soda can trick, they&#039;ve seen everything.<br />Your laptop idea sounds good if it&#039;s vac sealed, the laptop isn&#039;t encrypted (they may seize it), and you can turn it on without the stuff lighting on fire because sometimes they make you turn it on.<br /><br />Your problem is being a single guy driving across the border. You need a solid story why you are coming up here, where you are staying, and for how long.. don&#039;t say &quot;raves&quot;. 80% chance they just wave you through if you already have story down.<br /><br />Enjoy all the hot and slutty Montreal chicks FTW<br /><br />

				Not that I recommend this, but in 2005 I drove across the Vermont / Quebec border with 13 ecstasy pills and they were all consumed by us in Montreal about 2 hours later... so easy to go into Canada (they asked for everyone&#039;s ID in the car and took about 1 minute of time) but coming back to USA is a nightmare. <br /><br />If you go there with stuff, DON&#039;T BRING ANYTHING BACK!<br /><br />I know someone who was trying to come back from a big event in Quebec and was stopped at the border. He forgot that he had ONE ecstasy pill along with some weed in his glove box. He said if he remembered, he would&#039;ve threw it out before the border (not sure if that&#039;s true). Anyway, they found it and they put him in a room and asked him and his girlfriend a bunch of questions. His girlfriend got in no trouble at all and he was only given a fine for around $500 for the weed and the cop supposedly didn&#039;t do anything to him about the ecstasy because my friend had never been in trouble like that before... they told him if he ever does it again, he&#039;s obviously fucked. I forgot to add that he was an independent 23 year old when he got caught doing this and they actually called his parents to inform them that he was &quot;apprehended&quot; by the border patrol but would not tell them why. His mother was pissed because she got scared for no reason... she thought he was in &quot;real&quot; trouble... <br /><br />In summary: Crossing into Canada w/ stuff should be easy if you do it &quot;smart&quot; (even though they&#039;re well aware of any smuggling techniques - better to try than not at all). Never cross back to USA w/ anything.

				Montreal has the best rave scene ever!!! at least in canada.... Toronto I can say from experience sucks for raves.... they have one alraigh place called &quot;the government|.. its an afterhours and if you do end up going coming to canada&nbsp; and end up in toronto go there...<br /><br />Montreal on the other hand.. has all kinds of crazy raves and rave style clubs,... you can always check out redlite, stereo, bal en blanc, the parking if your into the gay scene but for real.. mtl is the place to party... we got the sickest djs.. hottest chicks and BEST drugs...<br /><br />Just dont try to bring anything over the border..that would be a real stupid decision.

				Use a rental car. Toss MDMA into the trunk, stuffed into back seat, somewhat well hidden. Wear gloves. <br /><br />In the even they do find it, as long as you say nothing, you&#039;ll be leaving a free man as it would be more of a hassle than its worth to prove.
