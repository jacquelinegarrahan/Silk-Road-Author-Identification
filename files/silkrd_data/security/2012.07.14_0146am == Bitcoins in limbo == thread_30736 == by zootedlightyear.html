				So I know that I along with a few other people have not received bitcoins that they deposited recently (most 2-3 days ago), but has anyone else had this problem? Has anyone with this problem gotten it resolved? Support sent me this message:<br />&nbsp;&quot;It can take 36-48 hours for your deposit to be processed. If after this time it has not arrived, please send me the relevant bitcoin address to me so I can look into it.<br /><br />~SR Support&quot;<br />However it&#039;s been over 48 hours and I have contacted them, but I have not received a response. I have 53 that are supposed to be here according to blockchain but they are not in my wallet. This whole situation is stressing me out.

				i&#039;m having the same exact problem, received the same exact reply from SR.&nbsp; i&#039;m getting really stressed out over it because i NEED some ecstasy and i&#039;ve no one to buy it from locally.&nbsp; yesterday my boyfriend and i got ripped off for $425 by this a**hole that my boyfriend used to get heroin from (he spent thousands of dollars using this guy as middle man and not once did he take off with the cash).&nbsp; so now my boyfriend thinks i&#039;m getting ripped off by the bitcoin service... i deposited $50 on 7/11 and $100 yesterday after i got the message from SR that it can take up to 36-48 hrs for the bitcoins to show up on my account.&nbsp; i wish i just deposited the $425 rather than trusting that scumbag with it because i have faith that it will eventually go thru, just hoping it&#039;s soon!
