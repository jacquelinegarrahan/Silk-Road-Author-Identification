				Hi OldschoolAU,<br /><br />If you&#039;re running Windows you can use Truecrypt to encrypt your entire hard disk too to make recovery of deleted files near impossible. Alternatively you could use a &quot;Live CD&quot; like TAILS to boot from - just bear in mind you&#039;ll need to enable Truecrypt each time you start up and only things you save to your USB stick will remain.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27792.msg303626#msg303626">Quote from: oldschoolau on June 22, 2012, 06:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As i have just begun vending i have spent the night improving my security protocols.
