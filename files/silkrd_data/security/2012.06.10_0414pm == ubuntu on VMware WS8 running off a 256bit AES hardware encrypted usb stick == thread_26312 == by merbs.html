				how safe is this set up?<br /><br />installed ubuntu (12.04 lts) on a 256bit AES hardware ecrypted USB stick (pin code on the actual drive) . i load the OS through VMware workstation and then use NAT which i have a feeling is not so secure. im using tor browser bundle for linux.<br /><br />running vmware workstaion 8 on windows 7, currently the network setting for vmware are NAT: which makes me think its not really that safe as it still uses your hosts IP address. could anybody with some experience give me some advice on how i could make this a completely secure method for using SR if that is even possible. any constructive criticism would be helpful.<br /><br />any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />thanks in advanced.<br /><br />UPDATE* id like to add that im using prepaid mobile phone internet for this and i did not have to reveal any information about my self, i used a &quot;third part&quot;<br />so to speak. who has no connection to me to purchase the sim card.<br />

				Mobile phones can be located to within a few meters even without the use of gps. Piggyback over someone with insecure wireless internet (WEP is very easily cracked - use aircrack-ng suite) and change your MAC address (macchanger). Would advise running from a live CD/DVD pre-configured for anonymity and privacy. Liberte linux or TAILS are good bets. USB sticks are read-write. CD/DVDs are read only, so any trojans or keyloggers that could *potentially* be installed on your machine would be wiped when you shut it down. When you go to your target wireless location (also change location frequently) turn off your phone completely and keep it off, you might be sending logs that could be used to trace you.

If you were running the Tor directly of your phone, that&#039;s a different matter and very insecure. Noone can work out that you&#039;re piggy backing off a mobile phone internet connection as long as you do everything through Tor from a laptop.<br /><br />As buttonmashkNFDmhgFGHFMgfd mentions, a live CD would be an even better option, but is impractical for saving lots of documents, the ultimate solution for you would be to use Liberte Linux from a USB stick. It already includes all the encryption of read/write files that you need to be worried about, and doesn&#039;t have as many potential security leaks as Ubuntu.<br />
