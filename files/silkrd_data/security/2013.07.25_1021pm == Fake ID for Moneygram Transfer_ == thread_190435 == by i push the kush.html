				So I just made my very first money-gram transfer for some coins, the lady at wal-mart asked me for my social security card and ID and even asked me what my occupation is. I&#039;m unemployed, I think that sending $3300 through money-gram being unemployed is a little weird&nbsp; :o Anyways I&#039;m sure this question has been asked a million times, but should I get a fake ID for money-gram transfers, would that also mean I would need a fake social security card? I saw them for sale in forgeries. Any feedback is appreciated, thanks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				I definitely would use a fake ID for moneygram transfers. I have a friend who bought ketamine online from India, he paid with Western Union and was a pretty big customer. Over a few months or so he ended up sending tens of thousands of dollars to India using his real ID at Western Union, and then he got raided by the IRS and charged with money laundering. Nothing about drugs was ever brought up as far as I am aware, the entire case against him focused on the fact that he had sent tens of thousands of dollars that he never had paid taxes on and had no legitimate reason for having. They never even found ketamine actually because he had orders drop shipped to his customers and never touched any drugs himself. <br /><br />On the other hand you really need to be careful with fake ID, as this whole Celtic shit has shown us. Fake ID can be extremely, extremely helpful for vendors but it can also amount to turning yourself in if your fake ID vendor happens to be the secret service. Way back in the day using fake ID for Western Union and Money Gram was a pretty standard way of paying for and accepting payment for drugs online, and also was standard for people to have mailboxes registered with fake ID.

				No need for fake ID....<br /><br />What you should&nbsp; have done is gone to 4 different Money Gram locations and did them all for under $1000.00.<br /><br />Then NO ID or all that information is required. <br /><br />They might ask for ID....because they work at Walmart and do not know the rules and they are just programed to ask for ID...but if you just say you do not have it...you will be all good.<br /><br />

				^^ what the King said. <br /><br />Anyone sending that much money is going to look at the very least somewhat suspicious.&nbsp; Spreading the money out through several transactions is a better, but more time staking method.&nbsp;
