				I got a message from a brand new registered forum member with no posts.&nbsp; <br /><br />He just asked if I have a PGP key because he wanted to communicate.<br /><br />Is there any risk to providing my public key and going from there?<br /><br />Obviously I would evaluate the content of the communication with extreme caution.<br /><br />Just want to make sure I am not missing something obvious here.&nbsp; Could be legit.&nbsp; Could be LE fishing (which is fine they won&#039;t get anything from me).&nbsp; I just want to know if it is risky to give my public key to some brand new guy without context.<br /><br />Thanks and apologies if this question makes me look foolish.

				no such thing as a foolish/paranoid question, foolish would be to abstain from asking it<br /><br />regarding your question, hopefully you&#039;ll get some technical advice from someone who knows more about security than i do. im not that big of an expert to dare comment. have you asked them who they are or what they want? could help provide some insight regarding intentions.

If you really don&#039;t trust them, and dont&#039; feel comfortable giving them your regular PGP key, there is no reason you should, you could just generate a throw-away key for communicating with this particular individual. The key could be discarded when you&#039;re through with it. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=219843.msg1597708#msg1597708">Quote from: newbottles on October 11, 2013, 07:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Obviously I would evaluate the content of the communication with extreme caution.<br /><br />Just want to make sure I am not missing something obvious here.&nbsp; Could be legit.&nbsp; Could be LE fishing (which is fine they won&#039;t get anything from me).&nbsp; I just want to know if it is risky to give my public key to some brand new guy without context. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I said there is nothing stopping you from generating a new key to use for this this session, and throwing it away afterward.

That&#039;s what a public key is for ... so you can post it on your profile or somewhere public where anyone can have it. But only you can decrypt any message encrypted with a public key with your secret key.<br /><br />Sounds like a noob that&#039;s paranoid about using TOR with recent events and all.
