				Hi I am going to be receiving money with western union / money gram soon, and was just wondering from anyone who has done this what&#039;s required to pick up the money? From my understanding I just need their name, my name the tracking number or what ever its called and ID? Is that correct? And would I ever need their phone number / address for any reason?<br /><br />Thanks a ton, alpine

The sender would fill out their money transfer form with the test question being set to say, &quot;What color are my eyes?&quot; and provide a fake name &amp; address for the receiver. He&#039;ll then tell you the fake name &amp; address he used, and the test question answer &quot;Blue&quot;, and you can pick it up using that fake name at any WU/MG location in your city.<br /><br />

				Wow thanks you helped clear up a lot! So this works the same for wu and mg? And say if I use a fake name and address for me and then they ask for ID for some reason would It be possible for the sender to get his money back if I was not able to pick it up? Thanks&nbsp; :)
