				PGP is a way of encrypting your messages/files.&nbsp; Specifically, on here, we like to encrypt our addresses when we send them to sellers.&nbsp; If, as I figure, you are using windows, then I suggest you go here and download what you need to download... http://www.gpg4win.org/<br /><br />They have all you need there, and the tutorial is fairly simple.&nbsp; It takes way to much time to explain it in depth, and I suggest you go to the above website, and to wiki to find out more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy<br /><br />Also you can search here, as there have been several threads discussing this.&nbsp; Just yesterday me and a friend here went thru using Kleopatra, so you could search on that...takes a bit of study, you&#039;ll get it though: it&#039;s actually kind of fun and interesting...

				You&#039;re doing fine...it&#039;s just tricky at first...once you get the basic idea, it seems kind of easy and even fun...but lots of people seem to go thru what you are going thru.&nbsp; I did too.&nbsp; In that tutorial I posted a link to, there is a site that you can send email to.&nbsp; First it&#039;s good to get the idea: You make a key for yourself first, you will have a public and a private key.&nbsp; Your *public* key is so I can send you messages, so you give that one out freely.&nbsp; Then I give you my public key, and you use that to send *me* messages.&nbsp; The private keys are how we decrypt the messages.<br /><br />Have you installed gpg4win (if you have windows?)&nbsp; then you&#039;ll have Kleopatra or PGA as your key manager.&nbsp; I&quot;d make a file on your Desktop with your public key, and post that, and somebody could use it to encrypt a message which you could decrypt.<br /><br />Anyway, get your regular browser, and get started here: http://www.gpg4win.org/&nbsp; They have a tutorial that walks you through it, or several have been posted on here...<br /><br />Here&#039;s the beginning of the tutorial...easy does it, it works: http://gpg4win.de/handbuecher/novices_5.html
