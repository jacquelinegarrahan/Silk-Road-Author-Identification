				Bitinstant doesn&#039;t require any info except a bitcoin address and email address.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s how I do it, not saying it&#039;s the right way:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Order bitcoins through bitinstant with MoneyGram (SR bitcoin address, get a new one each time, and my tormail address).<br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to moneygram place that has tellers, or go to a 7-11 that has one of those fancy looking ATM&#039;s with a receiver.&nbsp; &nbsp;Either way you&#039;ll talk to a real person.&nbsp; &nbsp;Give them a fake name, address, and phone number (i actually use a real phone number but that phone is not tied to my real identity.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moneygram has never called).. <br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bitcoins show up in your SR account a few hours later.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yay, time to buy some droogz!!&nbsp; :p<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I just realized i didn&#039;t actually answer your question!!&nbsp; &nbsp;What can I say, I&#039;m high!! haha<br /><br />You get a receipt e-mailed to you from bitinstant (don&#039;t download the pdf), I just take a picture of it and take it to moneygram.&nbsp; &nbsp; It has a receiver number (company transfering bitcoins to you), and account number (transaction number).&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s all moneygram requires in addition to name, address, and phone number (all fake!!).&nbsp;

				It doesnt cost that much.&nbsp; you are not sending money to a person.&nbsp; Its a business payment trans.&nbsp; There is no fee for moneygram.<br /><br /><br />Lots of businesses use MG or WU for payments.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some credit card companies even use them if you want to make a quick payment.&nbsp; It is NOT the same thing as sending money to a person.&nbsp; Therefore you do not get charged the same as you would if you were sending money to another person.
