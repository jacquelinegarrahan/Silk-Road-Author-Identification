				I usually start my tor browser, then go to silkroad wikipedia. Once there i use the URL listed to Login to silkroad. This morning I did this and noticed the URL had been changed, i clicked the new URL and the login page is now asking for my pin number. Is this a scam or a new security measure? I used another method to login.

				You should store TBB and your PGP software on encrypted media, then you can bookmark the URL or save it in a text file and avoid this problem.

They share a computer with family or roommates, or they go to a library, university, or internet cafe, and they don&#039;t want evidence of accessing SR on disk. An encrypted thumb drive is their best option, and I plan on writing a tutorial for that in the coming days.<br /><br />As for recognizing a phishy site, they don&#039;t even have to remember the entire 8 characters after silkroad. Memorizing 5piz3 is enough, since the probability of finding a private key that hashes to silkroad*5piz3* is extremely small. It would take ages to search the key space for a private key that hashes to a domain name containing those two strings. Looking for 5piz3 after silkroad will block 99.99% of all phishing attempts.

				I popped off over Christmas (not in that way) so I didn&#039;t notice the SilkWiki phise thing. Wikipedia was also attacked. Not to mention Hidden Wiki. Don&#039;t ever give your PIN. Don&#039;t ever give your PIN. Don&#039;t EVER give your PIN. Unless of course you need to, but it certainly won&#039;t be when you log in. I remember I was at BMR once and the URL didn&#039;t match the one right below it so I peed off out of there and came back the right way.<br /><br />Load up http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion and bookmark. Also, best to type these URLs down in case you need to download a new Tor update, as your old bookmarks will be on the old version. You need to start again.<br /><br />If you are still stuck, ask a young teacher at school, they&#039;re probably vendors lol.&nbsp; ;)
