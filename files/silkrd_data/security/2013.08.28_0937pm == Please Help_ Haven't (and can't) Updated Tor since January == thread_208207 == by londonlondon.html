				Hey fellas,<br />As title says, I haven&#039;t updated my Tor since January this year. I haven&#039;t ordered anything only used forums. I am running a Mac OSX 10.5, hence, I can&#039;t update Firefox/Tor. I was told to download the torrent for Mountain Lion (or w/e) 10.6, which I did, but I don&#039;t have sufficient space in my external hard drive to create a backup in Time Machine (from what I&#039;ve read, to install Mountain Lion I need to create a back up as the machine will be formatted).<br />Few questions:<br />1) I&#039;m interested in ordering asap(tomorrow/friday). Would it be very stupid to order something, not having Tor updated, using PGP?<br />2) If so, what alternatives do I have?Recommendations? Internet cafe?<br /><br />Thanks for your kind attention to my situation :).<br />

				I have used an out of date Tor Browser Bundle for months to visit The Pirate Bay because it&#039;s something I don&#039;t care about being found out about. I highly doubt you&#039;ll run into any trouble if you go ahead.<br /><br />For SR though I like to use TAILS. I don&#039;t think Macs can boot from USB though can they? Or are you on a Hackintosh? If so then TAILS would be your answer.

				That sucks!&nbsp; The right answer is to upgrade to a newer version of Mac OS, but you know that already.&nbsp; &nbsp;Until you can get to that point, this definitely isn&#039;t optimal, but....<br /><br />Only other idea I have is to install Virtualbox on your Mac, then either use a current version of Tails from a VM (just create a VM without a harddrive and use the .iso as a virtual CDROM to boot from) or to use Whonix (which may be too resource intensive for you).&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ll need enough free space for Virtualbox and a Tails ISO image, obviously.&nbsp; &nbsp; VMWare would also work instead of Virtualbox.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t fix anything if there&#039;s something wrong with your Mac now (i.e. malware), but I&#039;d feel safer with a current version of Tails in a VM on an older OS than I would with an antique version of the browser on an older OS.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just going to have to keep using it, make triple sure you keep Javascript turned off. <br /><br />You can also burn Tails to a DVD and boot off that if you have a working DVD drive on your Mac.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s slow to boot, but once it&#039;s up, it&#039;s just fine to use.
