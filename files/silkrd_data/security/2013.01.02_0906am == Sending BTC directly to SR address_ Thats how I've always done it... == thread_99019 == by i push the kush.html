				I have been a member here for 7 months now and I have ALWAYS had my coins sent directly to my SR address... I buy my coins from Blue Sky Traders though, I&#039;m assuming all of that information is public though? Does anyone else do this? I have been completely fine thus far (knock on wood)&nbsp; ;)

				I find the need to send your coins trough different service and not directly pretty useless - <br />The anonymity of the coins is not because the addresses are not traceable - they can be easily traced,&nbsp; but because of the fact that no one can know whos the owner of a specific address,&nbsp; that quite enough,&nbsp; the route is meaningless. but maybe im mistaken so who knows.

				My policy is that there is no such thing as being too careful when it comes to your identity and it being connected with the SR. I know there are plenty of features and the DPR has made this place a wonderful oasis of information and security, but he can only do so much. I personally feel better when I do as much as I can to stay hidden. At the very least tumble your coins a bit before going in the SR. Heaven forbid, some wise hacker turns to LE to save his own ass and the people here pay the price for it. It might never happen, but then again the titanic was an unsinkable ship too wasn&#039;t it?

				Send a small amount to instawallet... wait a bit then send it to easywallet, notice the address instawallet sent with was not the same as the one you sent? Now go play some poker at seals with clubs, break even and withdraw, now send it to its final destination.<br /><br />There are plenty of sites out there that use pools of common wallets to store your bitcoins. They act as mixers for you.<br /><br />In order to track you they would need logs from the blockchain, instawallet, easywallet, and seals with clubs.<br /><br />With just bitcoinfog an attacker would need logs from the blockchain and bitcoinfog. Well the fella who runs bitcoinfog has access to bitcoinfog logs and the blockchain, he can track your money. It is a lot of trust to give one person.<br /><br />Just my take.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;The fee for sending money through bitinstant is like 7% so I always just figure 10% more money than I actually need, then I send it to my blockchain wallet, then I send that to another blockchain wallet w/ the optional anonymizing step that costs an extra .02 BTC from blockchain, then from there I send it to SR. I always change address every 2nd order. I may be super paranoid, but I haven&#039;t been caught yet. <br /><br />I want to work on this method a little, as I don&#039;t think bitinstant is as secure as everyone seems to think. I will start looking into some reliable btc vendors on the SR to add to the self sustaining econ. within the SR itself, but I feel that with the tumble through a couple of wallets and then into my account, I am relatively safe. At least for the comparably small purchase I make.

				Everyone seems to know the &quot;how&quot; but no one seem to know the &quot;why&quot; ?<br /><br />nobody need logs to track the route of a bitcoin, just need to spend some time and get this pretty much figured out...<br />BUT you still cant tie a specific address to a person / service - so its pretty much useless anyway.<br /><br />example *Clearnet* http://anonymity-in-bitcoin.blogspot.co.il/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous.html<br /><br />i have no doubt that there are some LE branches that can do quite a good job with this if its on their high priority, and in this case, mixing will be useless again, its just another form of getting a false sense of security while paying some commission.

				Many mixing services just mix up a bunch of other people&#039;s bitcoins using the blockchain.<br /><br />The whole point of hiding the source is to use someone else&#039;s ledger for part of the trail. If I sent to &quot;seals with clubs&quot; and then send from there to another address it will not be tracable in the blockchain no matter how heavy the investigation is. The information needed is in &quot;seals with clubs&quot; database/logs.<br /><br />By chaining several independent services together you make it near impossible that any one person could gather all of the needed info.

				I think the mixing services give a false sense of security. As others have said here, the most important thing is to prevent LE from identifying your address and the recipient address, and tying it back to you.

				Use Tor, go to Bitinstant.com, use a fake name for a Moneygram/ZipZap payment, send it right to your SR bitcoin address. No worries.

				How safe would the following be?<br /><br />Using Tor, go on localbitcoins, find reliable vendor who deals in f2f, establish meeting place, then once the BTC are in your wallet on localbitcoins, transferring them on here.

				Well... if you can manage to get your bitcoins under another name or anonymously i suppose sending directly into your buyer account shouldn&#039;t be a problem at all... ;) no need&nbsp; to use blockchain or other wallets...
