				Hello All, I am glad to be here and to be learning about how everything works!. I am just glad to see that there are people who are concerned about privacy and are creating options for us that don&#039;t like the idea of everything we do being recorded and tracked by the NSA and other U.S. government agencies.<br /><br />I am curious if anyone has experience getting bitcoins in Honduras or other central American countries. We don&#039;t have the same major banks that are in the states, at least in my area, but we do have some banks and wire transfer services. Does anyone have any recommendations for resources or information that could help? Thanks! :)

				Hello and welcome!<br /><br />I would suggest you take a look at CLEARNET https://bitcointalk.org/. It is the &quot;official&quot; bitcoin forum and I think they must know of options for you. If you are paranoid just make sure when registering you use a throw-away email address and tor so that your real identity cannot be linked to your account (since somebody reading both your post here and eventually a similar post on bitcointalk will know it is the same person...)<br /><br />Also I know that at least bitcoinnordic.com do accept cashU (expensive though), if you are able to buy those.<br /><br />Good luck to you!

				thank you guys for the replies -&nbsp; yes, Honduras is indeed very beautiful!&nbsp; i am enjoying the break from the hustle and bustle of where we lived in the states.<br /><br />I have done some research, and searched the bitcointalk forum and although there are Moneygram services all over here in Honduras, it appears that bitinstant still only works with certain countries. What do you think about this plan?&nbsp; On bitinstant.com, select the bank transfer option and since my bank is in the US, select the US as the country. Then&nbsp; transfer to email (via coinapult). Then put the coins through a few different wallets, and then bitcoinfog and I figure that although the coins started with my bank account, by the time they were tumbled&nbsp; through those services, the trail would be broken. What do you think?

				Yeah, they have lots of places with moneygram, but as far as I know, bitinstant doesn&#039;t work with them - I am going to try an international wire transfer through a local bank through bitme.com - still anonymous, but it will take 2-3 days according to their website. so far this is the safest and most sure option I have seen.
