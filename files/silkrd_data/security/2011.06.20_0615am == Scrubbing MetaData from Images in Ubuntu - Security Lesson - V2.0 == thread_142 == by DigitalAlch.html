				Scrubbing Meta Data from Images in Ubuntu<br /><br />This is pretty vital.&nbsp; I have notice people are uploading images a lot, both for avatars and in posting items. Something you may not know is that most digital cameras add hidden data called &nbsp;EXIF data, and on top of that most computers add in there own metadata such as IPTC and XMP. This data can reveal alot of data you do not want others to have. As such we should scrub this data before uploading. You should all be accessing this website (and all of the DeepWeb) through a VirtualMachine running Ubuntu (I&#039;ll write a guide on that later). <br /><br />So launch up Ubuntu, go to shell (Applications -&gt; Accessory -&gt; Terminal) and type:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">sudo apt-get install exiv2</code>(Press y then enter when asked)<br />This will install jhead, the program that will accomplish this.&nbsp; Once you have installed it you can either find out more info on it by typing:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">man exiv2</code>or just get down to businesses. To do this we will move to the directory our images are in:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">cd Pictures</code>(this moves to folder called pictures) IF you are wondering what folder are in your current directory you can type <br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">ls</code>Now we can either remove the meta data from all images:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">exiv2 -d a *.jpg</code>Keep in mind if you have any .JPG / .JPEG / .jpeg remember to run for each one. Example:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">jexiv2 -d a *.JPEG</code><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Thanks for the heads up OP. I believe everything went OK but I think you have a typo in your last code.It says &quot;jexiv2&quot; and I spent a good time looking for a package that didn&#039;t exist before I realized that it was typo. Especially since it makes it look like it is a version of exiv2 for JPEG files, And that was what that last code was pertaining too. <br />I could see that typo giving a lot of ubuntu noobs a headache.

				Very nice post. Actually thought it had no sense to remove the EXIF data (like shutter speed, ISO, aperture, etc). But it contains also the camera model used, that may be helpful, if you own this camera and its found in your basement by cops - right?

				Not sure if it has been mentioned yet, but jhead is also good and may even come with ubuntu already. If you have it installed you can do a whole directory at a time by going to the directory with the images and doing<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">ls | xargs jhead -purejpeg<br /></code>That&#039;s it, and it&#039;s done.

I always do that. That&#039;s why I use jp*g when I&#039;m working with a load of jpgs. Also the -type &#039;file&#039; was wrong, it&#039;s -type f . I didn&#039;t make the same mistake when I just used it, but saw it when I came back here to fix the jp*g shit. Using the -exec flag with find, you can really make some awesome one-liners, and that&#039;s what makes *nix so awesome imo. If I thought there was any interest at all in explaining how that command works I&#039;d share, but I seriously doubt anyone gives a fuck about how some command is read. Sorry for being high and trying to add useful content. I&#039;ll go back to adding nothing of value now, thank you for your time. <br /><br />Either way, this is the easiest way on earth to clean 3000 jpgs of metadata

				I downloaded a photo of some MDMA pills some vendor had taken. The meta info was all there. It was taken on a Blackberry - my expertise is limited but I am sure some probing would reveal the serial and that is likely linked to the phone account which reveals the person who took the photo! (this is what the cops would think)<br /><br />I guess I ought to warn that vendor.<br /><br />I get rid of meta if by simply displaying my photo then taking a screenshot! That screenshot has meta info but I doubt I can be traced from it as I will do this using virtual box. Not sure if this is 100% proof safe but a screen shot will not carry any of the photo meta info. Maybe the operating system and serial number - the same used by millions!<br /><br />I do not use Linux much but have got to work out my new Linux set up and get my wireless working!!<br /><br />Thanks for this read - always good to see security issues taken seriously.<br /><br />A new generation has been raised to accept technology as second nature.

				Tinfoilhattery follows.<br /><br />Please be aware of camera fingerprinting.<br />It is possible to associate photos with each other through unique noise pattern deviations in CCD sensors.[1]<br /><br />I can&#039;t give reliable advice on how to avoid this but ideally you would never use the same camera for anything that could be connected to your identity. If that&#039;s not practical, at least always make sure to resize the image and maybe add some noise in a photo editing program.<br /><br />It is not known whether LEAs use CCD noise fingerprinting but given that it can be fully automated, it&#039;s not far fetched to assume they do. I&#039;d be damned if there isn&#039;t an NSA server cluster somewhere that archives and analyzes images, particularly from social networks like Facebook. The archives only gain in value as analysis techniques are refined over the years.<br /><br />I would not overestimate this method.<br />Just be careful.<br /><br />==== CLEARNET ====<br />http://cs.iupui.edu/~tuceryan/pdf-repository/Lukas2006.pdf<br />================<br /><br />P.S.: Besides CCD noise ID, which is publicly researched, there is the possibility that digital cameras add unique watermarks to images. That, however, is pure speculation based on the fact that many printer vendors are working with LEAs. Many printers add nearly invisible watermarks to every printed page. This is public information.<br /><br />==== CLEARNET ====<br />https://www.eff.org/issues/printers<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10719.0 (Your Laser Printer Will Testify Against You)<br />================<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want to be better safe than sorry, use a separate camera.

You will be shocked at what is recorded. In terms of GPS, almost every smart phone records the exact time and GPS (if its enabled) location for each picture. If GPS is off, it will even triangulate the position as an estimate. 4chan is an interesting place to EXIF view images LOL. It should be important to note that sites like IMGUR remove all EXIF data when a photo is uploaded.

				It should be noted that PNG files often DO contain metadata. To see this metadata in Ubuntu, install the package pngmeta (&quot;sudo apt-get install pngmeta&quot;, or search for it in a package manager). For example, files saved with GIMP by default have at least:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Comment: Created with GIMP<br />Modification Time: 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Albeit with the real time of creation, rather than the UNIX epoch. In GIMP at least, you can switch off the saving of this metadata in the options box that appears when you save a PNG file.

				Rename it? Why? If you want to get rid of the metadata you can use command line programs for linux that have been listed, or any of the other GUI applications that have been mentioned. If that still doesn&#039;t work you can honestly upload to imgur and download it again while on Tor. Photoshop even has an option to save images without any metadata. And as Crooked mentioned, you can even take a screenshot of the image and it will remove the metadata. It is not stored in the image data, it&#039;s just a header on the file so it has nothing to do with the filename.
