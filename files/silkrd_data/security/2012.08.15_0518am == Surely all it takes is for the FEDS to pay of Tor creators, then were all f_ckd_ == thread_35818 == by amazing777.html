				i was thinking about this, really we are all just putting our trust in TOR?<br /><br />what if the feds pay the makers of TOR, 10 million USD and they accept then all our info is traceable and leakable?<br /><br />can someone help explain?

				Nope, Tor is not centralized over anyone. If it was the FEDs would already arrest (not pay) its creators and seized the servers.<br />So, the creators are just that, the programmers, nothing else.

The ability to do that without a massive botnet is of limited use though, and it would be noticed pretty quickly if the directory authority nodes suddenly started to say the Tor network consisted of an entirely different set of nodes than it did five minutes ago.

				Can&#039;t be done.<br /><br />Like Assange did. <br />It is possible to read what is being written, but not who has written it.<br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s called anonymous.<br />&nbsp;You / they will have to find out reading the content of the data, by whom it is written.<br />That&#039;s why gpg is so important.<br /><br />Be careful with torbutton(toggle) (is not in use anymore) anonymox&nbsp; (tor)addon, JAP.<br />Software can be easily found, that will ( permission included)&nbsp; point you out on google-maps when you are using anonymox and jap.<br /><br />A good way to stay safe is to use the tails live-cd os.<br />But even tails will send you time and again to the same node.<br />When you are blocked somewhere you will need to change the node.
