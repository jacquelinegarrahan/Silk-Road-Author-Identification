Learn to search and read and you&#039;ll figure things out. Ask thought out questions on pertinent threads.

				I only asked. If you have got no manners, that&#039;s your problem. I&#039;m sure you didn&#039;t know how to use the site when you first joined. Selfish you are....

				Sure lets talk manners: Your new on a forum and the first 8 posts you post on other people unrelated threads are exactly the same request. Learn how to start you own thread, or better yet read some other people posts, because many people have asked the exact same questions and it has been answered umpteen times.<br /><br />facebook and Limetless, my apologies...

Way of The Dark Side, that is.<br /><br />Seriously though, stop spamming other people&#039;s threads. You&#039;ve been posting since 1:48pm, with your last post being at 7:10pm - ALL posts asking people to &quot;give me an idiots guide on how to obtain bitcoins and make a purchase. I am not a computer whizzkid and i need a simple guide.&quot;<br /><br />You keep asking for &#039;an idiots guide&#039;. If you spent half the time using the Search function in the upper right hand corner (go to the main Forum section for the most results), or searching on Google, you&#039;d have your head completely wrapped around the process of purchasing Bitcoin.<br /><br />The only &#039;idiots guide&#039; I can offer you is to tell you to stop being an idiot. Use your brain to tell your fingers to type queries into a search engine such as Google or the Search box here on the forums, and do your own research. Nobody&#039;s going to hold your hand here. <br /><br />No, not everyone knew how to purchase Bitcoin when they arrived here, but they all figured it out. A result of that is literally HUNDREDS of threads pertaining to the purchase of Bitcoin, and what to / what not to do. If you can&#039;t figure it out by reading the information that is already out there, then no information that anyone here gives you will be of any use to you.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /><br />
