				I ordered my usual from my vendor but this time things took a slight turn.<br /><br />Expecting a package today, instead I got a slip in my mailbox requesting signature. The type of mail this vendor sends is priority, and he has to check the box to void the signature requirement. The last time I had to sign for it, but I picked it up at the post, and everything was fine. <br /><br />This time I have to sign for it, but I noticed something very strange! <br />This time the package took a little bit longer to get in the area, because for some reason it got stuck at customs for 2 days. Then it just got sent along. What should I do!? <br /><br />The slip says the package is at my city&#039;s local sorting center, which is 30 minutes away. My local post office that delivers my mail is 5 minutes away. How did the sorting center get the slip to my local post office, and why did they not just send the package to the local post office?<br /><br />What should I do? Did they discover my package and try to trick me to signing the slip? Can they get a warrant off the slip alone?<br /><br />I have absolutely nothing drug related at my house at all, and all my hard drives are heavily encrypted. <br /><br />Am I just being paranoid and perhaps the vendor forgot to check off Void Signature like he did previously? <br /><br />Please I need advice! I can&#039;t just ignore it, this was a big order. It was shipped from Canada to the Mid-West US<br /><br />Is it at all possible for them to do a controlled delivery if I am signing a slip and not an item? How can they prove it was me who signed the paper? How would they even arrest me? Couldn&#039;t somebody have creeped by my mailbox and forged my signature? Can they arrest days after you sign something?

				I noticed there an option to &#039;sign&#039; for it online.<br /><br />The slip says <br /><br />&quot;For Redelivery<br /><br />Go to usps.com/redelivery or see reverse&quot;<br /><br />The back is where I&#039;m supposed to sign it, meaning I can &#039;sign&#039; online.<br /><br />Could I submit it online with the information? Because anybody can submit online and nobody can prove it&#039;s me. The redelivery thing just proves I was expecting it, or somebody at the address was.

				Would they even do a &quot;controlled delivery&quot; via me signing a slip? Wouldn&#039;t they arrest me the moment I sign it?<br /><br />They wouldn&#039;t arrest me for a slip they didn&#039;t see me sign personally hours/days later would they?<br />

				This just happened to me as well. I went online and scheduled a redelivery. In the special instructions box I included: &quot;Please leave package in mailbox or leave at front door&quot; or something to that effect. Fingers crossed, hope it works. Will update here.

				Did they ask for your signature though?<br /><br />I notice on the pink slip it also says on the back below the &quot;Leave item at my address box&quot;...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Specific where to leave. Example: &quot;Porch&quot; , &quot;Sidedoor&quot;. This option is not available if box is checked on the front requiring your signature at the time of delivery. &quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Though why leave the pink slip in the first place if no signature required?

				I&#039;m actually beginning to think the vendor just forgot to check the box that voids the signature requirement<br /><br />Because last time I signed at the post, the post man said Canada requires my signature. - got it sent to a PO box and picked it up since it was too big to fit in the po box<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how often this vendor sends packages for this BIG order size,&nbsp; but if it&#039;s not often he may have forgotten about the signature option if he doesn&#039;t send this way very often. Since the 2nd time I ordered this way of delivery they asked me to sign and nothing happened. Perhaps he just forgot. Though he is one of the top major vendors. Though he has a lot of small orders, not many huge ones like I&#039;m doing I believe.<br /><br />&quot;ranked in the top 10% of sellers with 99.9% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions&quot;

				Is the item bigger than the box it is supposed to be placed in ? Did it take longer than past items ? Whats the weight involved roughly.<br /><br />Ask yourself those questions ... you can figure things out. Answers should be Yes and No to the first 2 questions.<br />

				Okay I got my package guys. I went to the post office and picked it up. <br /><br />Apperently the PO Man gave it to me and said okay just sign real quick. He had some trouble scanning the package and said well, never mind, I guess it&#039;s just delivery confirmation... <br /><br />So my assumption is USPS is simply retarded.<br /><br />Or maybe they only asked me to sign for the fact I put the address of one shipping location, and the zip code of my other shipping location. This probably flagged the package and is probably why it got stuck in customs for an extra day.<br /><br />Needless to say, if they give you a pink slip in the mail, they likely wont bust you. It probably means you fucked up the address some way. I think if they&#039;re gunna bust you, they want to control the situation as much as possible, such as watching you sign it. <br /><br />If they don&#039;t watch you sign it, they have a bunch of other stuff to prove such as, if it was even you who signed it or not.

				Signing for a package containing drugs sounds insane to me. I always make sure it is sent with no signature required. If a signature is requested I always assume its a controlled delivery and deny ownership while hoping that is enough to keep my door from getting kicked in.

				I understand the vendors using a tracking to prevent being reverse scammed by a new account holder. But I still think it is unsafe and puts customers at risk. Then again if very small or personal amounts of the drug are being shipped and are seized the police usually do not spend much time trying to execute a controlled delivery. Thats just my opinion though.

				Well...<br /><br />The scheduled redelivery that I made online didn&#039;t work since it needed a signature.&nbsp; So I messaged Wright and he explained that USPS seems to ignore the Canadian postal codes, that&#039;s why it required a sig. Not cool. That meant that I had to go to the PO to retrieve the letter. Fuck, that was totally sketchy.&nbsp; I had to sign and print my name and show ID (fake ID - even sketchier).&nbsp; <br /><br />Wow, that sucked. <br /><br />But in retrospect, it was a completely normal process.&nbsp; I was just really fuckin&#039; nervous. Glad that is over!<br /><br />The reward was some fire powder that I immediately attacked and had a wonderful rest of my day. <br /><br />Update: forgot to mention that Wright offered to credit me the cost of the express shipping or send extra weight with my next order! Yay for that!

				Glad it worked out for you.<br /><br />Maybe in the future if this happens again to anyone, one could send a friend willing to take the risk.&nbsp; Anybody can pick up your mail for you, have them sign, if it is a bust, well then they just keep their trap shut and get a lawyer.&nbsp; Tell the lawyer some random guy paid you 50 bucks to get the package, and eventually go home scott free.
