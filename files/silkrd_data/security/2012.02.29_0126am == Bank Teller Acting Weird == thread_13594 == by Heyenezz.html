				I wouldn&#039;t think this is an issue. Bank Tellers are bored, they repeatedly do the same monotonous activities all day, probably was just generally curious. <br /><br />Beside, the great thing about the bitcoins is that it isnt illegal to acquire them and they cant prove (under normal circumstances) what you&#039;re use them for...It is more than probably nothing illegal or nefarious at all.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t give it a second thought&nbsp; ;)

				Just tell him you are trading internet currencies, and making some money doing it.&nbsp; You can wire transfer but the fees are higher and it takes 3 days, but with the way you are doing it you will have the virtual currency in a couple of hours.&nbsp; If he&#039;s interested in bitcoin, saying something like &quot;it&#039;s the way of the future, especially for buying stuff on the internet.&nbsp; Some companies are even giving discounts when you use them&quot;.&nbsp; blah blah.&nbsp; act excited about bitcoins (or if you actually are, as I am, just be yourself and shoot the shit).

				As others have mentioned, I think they&#039;re just bored and nosey.<br /><br />Before I had Internet banking and Paypal set up, I used to make cash deposits at various banks for eBay purchases.<br /><br />90% of the time, the tellers would be like &quot;Ooh, is this for something on eBay?

				It&#039;s not that easy. Get-Bitcoin only uses Chase and Bank of America. There are only a few of these branches where I live. <br /><br />I&#039;d use another exchanger except I can&#039;t find a cheaper, faster, or most importantly, more secure method of getting bitcoins than I do now. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;m seriously at risk. He has no way of knowing who I am or where I live. It&#039;s more annoying than anything to be asked about your business.

				You can do cash deposits through bitinstant for 5% fee at different banks if you are interested and then buy the coins on mt. gox. Its even faster than get-btc and you can get the coins for the actual market price instead of how I found wit get-btc which gives you coins for the highest rate reached that day it seems. <br /><br />The tellers actually recognize me too, which really isnt a big deal to me. One just asked why the acct was in GA and I said it was an online payment thing. Some do look at you funny after youve handed them a few hundred dollars more than a couple times though. I switch banks too but only have a couple options and it seems like this one girl is the only one who ever works at one. I forgot the acct number once and she helped look it up for me with the name, and even remember it was the right one and where it was located... <br /><br />If they mention btc just tell them it is like a stock market exchange and you are trying to make some easy money of the future.

				Funnily enough I was asked about this when I made a deposit recently. (after 2 other times with no questions from the teller). The girl was very friendly and bubbly and it seemed like a natural curiosity though. She claimed to have never heard of BTC. I just vaguely explained it was similar to Paypal and she seemed to be happy with that.

				Yeah, there really are so many reasons to be buying bitcoins I don&#039;t think you should be worried at all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been asked before too and I just say I use them as &#039;credits&#039; for online poker just like you buy chips at a casino.<br /><br />I&#039;m 99% sure they just ask out of sheer curiosity.

				Tell them it&#039;s used for eBay.<br /><br />99% chance they won&#039;t know.<br /><br />Also - <br /><br />Never go to female tellers. They&#039;re more &quot;everything by the books&quot; type, while guys are more likely to just not give a fuck.<br /><br />Just my personal experience from over a dozen bank deposit transactions.<br /><br />One older woman asked me what it was and I told her it was for eBay. She seemed happy with that.<br /><br />I make sure to vary my transaction times and location so I don&#039;t run the risk of running into the same person twice. Usually works.

				I visit the same branch at the same time pretty often to make cash deposits for Get-Bitcoin. Every time, there is the same guy who not only sees me, the majority of the time he is my teller. Today he asked me &quot;How is business going for you?&quot; I didn&#039;t know how to reply because I didn&#039;t know what he was talking about about..But I figured he assumed I worked for GetBitcoin..I said &quot;Not bad.&quot; and he asked what it is &quot;we&quot; do...I told him it&#039;s a virtual currency to play games on the internet, like FarmVille or The Sims. I guess it was good enough for him because he didn&#039;t ask any more questions. <br /><br />Not too worried about it, he is friendly enough. I certainly remember him from the 2nd time I walked in, so I only assumed he remembered me.

				- i&#039;ve never heard of UK bank tellers asking anything aside what they need to type in the computer as &quot;personal&quot; bank transactions are non of<br />&nbsp; their business, their job is just to process the info and move on to the next customer -maybe tellers in usa have different job function(s)..?!<br />- should have been better prepared mentally, playing the scenario over and over in your head what your responses would have been...<br />- common sense suggests you use different bank branches, break up routine, get to know who is behind the counter i know its difficult but the<br />&nbsp; more banks you walk into the less chance you&#039;ll be recognised -and why would you be recognised if they deal with hundreds of customers...?!<br />- another possibility if the account has been flagged up on the screen and the teller is purposefully asking these questions as the bank is hoping<br />&nbsp; to shut the account down...they suspect somethin&#039;s up already.<br /><br />- bitcoins could be used to fund your online gaming account !!<br />

The most sketchy response I have gotten came from a younger male teller who acted all sketched out I was handing him cash... he even asked to see my id or card and I just told him it was a commercial acct, and I didnt give him anything but the cash and deposit slip. Then he asked if it was my acct and so I told him it was an online payment processor (this was for bitinstant so btc isnt in the name). Asking for my identification is getting too intrusive though, Ive never had anyone else do that and dont know why he would have needed it...

				I get asked almost every time I need to transfer funds at a bank for BTC purposes.<br /><br />I FLIPPED out on the teller the last time, bank manager ran out, and he was ultimately sent home for asking a client for privileged and private information that he purported was required for him to process any deposit&#039;s (that&#039;s when I started flipping out, i do not like being lied to and he was persistent lol).<br /><br />The latest time I went into a bank as always the teller asks me what this is for, do i trust this company (is it any of the banks business what businesses I deposit funds into?), etc.&nbsp; My response was a stout &quot;It&#039;s none of your business is it?&quot;&nbsp; She became notably less chatty lol and responded no sir I guess it&#039;s not, and then proceeded to silently and effortlessly do her job.<br />

I read quite fast, soon I will be through all the intel posted on the forums, no fear of the written word here, haha! Some Jews might have been passive sheep to the slaughter, but some of them certainly were not, you must have heard of the vicious battles that raged inside the ghettos all over Europe? In some cases it took months for the Germans to take back control of the very inner cities they were supposed to be occupying! No, I assure you the Jews by no means were pacifists. At least some of them were insightful enough to understand the reports from the camps and what they meant.<br /><br />My point about hunter gather societies wasn&#039;t that States are non-violent, because the State is inherently based upon the threat of violence. Any political scientist worth his salt who&#039;s read Leviathan by Hobbs knows that. No nation state, no social contract.<br /><br />Where we fundamentally disagree I think, is that I see a terrible threat from decentralized violence in anarchist society, where groups will form and develop neverending vendetta on each other&#039;s heads over and over and over. Much like the mob wars in Italy. Much like any tribe in Africa today. Ultimately leading to more destruction that any State would impose, after all, if people are dead they cannot pay their taxes. There is an upper limit on the insanity of a State, where it begins to destroy itself even if it&#039;s not held to account for it&#039;s murderous actions.<br /><br />You could tell me that we could have privately organized justice systems competing with each other, but I wonder how they will compete if there is no arbiter between them to stop violence between them.<br /><br />That may sound abstract, so let&#039;s get concrete. I don&#039;t like Sharia Law and Muslims don&#039;t like some Western Laws. It would be easy to develop conflict between those two competing legal systems, and by conflict I mean it literally. Locals are always enraged in Europe when Muslims attempt to implement Sharia customs, I find it easy to imagine violence consequences if the hand of the State wasn&#039;t there to stay both parties. <br /><br />Some evidence for my thinking, is that Nation States have much lower rates of violent crime than the so-called Failed States. If you look over time, over the last 3-4 centuries, the stronger the State becomes, the lower the crime rate becomes. Today we live in the least violent time period in history. It&#039;s been a steady linear decrease in violent crime per capita over time. (albeit you&#039;d never believe it from the Media!)<br /><br />Now, that doesn&#039;t mean that &#039;external violence&#039; does not exist. Clearly the inter-state wars of the 20th century were exceptionally bloody.<br /><br />But the internal violence has steadily declined for centuries with the rise of the Nation State, and any anarchist has to explain how his society would replicate that effect without taking us back to tribalism. It is totally conceivable that we could politically &#039;de-evolve&#039;.<br /><br />Do you have an answer to this?<br /><br />tldr; why throw out the baby with the bathwater?<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve long said that I would be satisfied with minarchism, but I believe in the power of universal human self-interest and therefore in anarcho-capitalism.<br /><br />I would be fine with government courts and police and such, so long as they didn&#039;t actually have a coercive monopoly on their services and people could say &quot;you suck&quot; and move over to a private alternative.<br /><br />Having a massive monopoly on violence means you have a structure just sitting their waiting to be co-opted by whichever ideology happens to have a majority at the time.&nbsp; If enough muslims kept immigrating into europe and having 9-children families and teaching Sharia law, in a generation or two you suddenly have a &quot;moral majority&quot; and under collectivist/statist doctrine they can just &quot;swap&quot; the whole system over to Sharia and nobody has any say in the matter.<br /><br />Personal crime might be down, but I would argue that crime has a lot more to do with poverty and a human&#039;s ability to defend him/herself.&nbsp; Again, I go back to guns.&nbsp; The market provided a man or woman with ability to stand up against multiple assailants with this tool, which is a natural deterrent to crime (see switzerland, with its 90-something-percent household gun ownership, and lowest violent/property crime rates in western civilization).&nbsp; But the bigger issue is poverty.&nbsp; If people have the opportunity to pursue self-interest in a profitable manner, they aren&#039;t going to pursue crime (because it&#039;s dangerous/high risk) over an honest profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />For a good primer on US history, I would recommend checking out Thomas Woods, a Harvard PhD historian and Austrian economics.&nbsp; His book &quot;33 questions about American History&quot; is excellent.&nbsp; All of his books are excellent, truth be told, and his sourcing of facts is pretty much unparalleled in his history and economic papers and books.<br /><br />If we look at crime now there are some distinct categories we can place things in to.&nbsp; General sadism is still pretty flat, and has increased in most western countries since major gun bans came into effect (things like rape, most of which aren&#039;t even reported).&nbsp; Drug crimes and all of the associated crime (I think something like 30-40% of violent crime is drug related in the US, and a similar amount for property theft) are up as enforcement becomes more and more draconian.&nbsp; It is the economics of prohibition that turn people into 100% habit-focused addicts.&nbsp; The production cost on cocaine is dirt cheap, and that&#039;s still with production being illegal.&nbsp; Mark up is tens of thousands of percent by the time it hits the ounce-buying dealer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to mention that while private-interaction violence drops off (I credit this to capitalism providing better outlets for self-interest, versus state coercion), the 20th century saw more mass murder and collectivist &quot;cleansing&quot;, along with eugenics and a hundred million sacrifices to Molech, than any other century prior.&nbsp; These were state atrocities, not individual or group actions.<br /><br />An example of how the economics of statist policies/collectivist morality affect crime:&nbsp; A regular cocaine habit takes something like $50,000 - $70,000 to sustain in the US.&nbsp; The high end of that is almost double what the average US worker makes pre-tax.&nbsp; Celebrities, a great many of whom are cocaine addicts, can sustain this habit and one generally doesn&#039;t even know they are addicted.&nbsp; An average person must focus all of their time and energy on acquiring the resources to keep the addiction sated.&nbsp; And because an &quot;honest job&quot; hardly covers the costs or falls very short.&nbsp; violent crime or prostitution or becoming a seller, etc. are the only ways to sustain this for a large percentage of users.&nbsp; Imagine if free markets were allowed to provide something like cocaine, at $2.00 per gram and extremely high purity, coffee-shop style, completely unregulated.&nbsp; Any addict could be a 100% functional member of society that would only have to devote a small part of their life to feeding this habit, the same as someone addicted to caffeine might.<br /><br />

And people do avail of these freedoms when it&#039;s in their interest to do so, but it&#039;s not the case that entire nations get up and go suddenly.<br /><br />Now, like yourself, I think there should be *no* barriers to the movement of labor. Governments should compete for people as clients to be taxed etc. But I think we are 50% of the way there, even though it was much freer at the beginning of the 20th century than it is today. The world wars devastated the ideals of capitalism.<br /><br />However, we do seem to have a paradox where distinctly centralized and powerful states in Hong Kong and Singapore are quite authoritarian, I mean socially authoritarian not economically, but nevertheless these are extremely free markets with governments that appreciate the fundamentals of capitalism. Recently the Hong Kong government gave everyone a rebate of six or nine thousand dollars, because they didn&#039;t need the money... These states, incidentally to anybody else reading this discussion, are among the lowest in terms of taxation in the world. They are also very resilient to economic crisis and have next to no poverty or other social ills. Basically, if you take care of the market, it takes care of most other things without requiring continual expensive interventions. All the empirical evidence you want is in those two cities. Tax is an afterthought in the minds of most Singaporeans and Hong Kong citizens. Yet their governments are extremely powerful and influential on the world scene.<br /><br />I think in the long term, this is the future. Very large city states controlling the world. That countries, nations will recede in importance and cities will become the dominant new &#039;State&#039;. Just like in ancient Greece. Anyway, I seem to have wandered off topic... :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13594.msg133988#msg133988">Quote from: anarcho47 on March 02, 2012, 05:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Having a massive monopoly on violence means you have a structure just sitting their waiting to be co-opted by whichever ideology happens to have a majority at the time.&nbsp; If enough muslims kept immigrating into europe and having 9-children families and teaching Sharia law, in a generation or two you suddenly have a &quot;moral majority&quot; and under collectivist/statist doctrine they can just &quot;swap&quot; the whole system over to Sharia and nobody has any say in the matter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yup, which is why democracy is not a pancrea.

Opportunities available to me, are scant. The fault ultimately lies in the high taxation of Europe. There is no opportunities for smart hungry people anymore. The government hasn&#039;t the first fucking clue, they keep blathering on about &#039;information technology&#039;, &#039;bio-tech&#039;, &#039;nano-tech&#039; as if that will save them from the tremendous morass, the huge burden they&#039;ve placed on us. When I was legit I remember spending weeks and weeks filling in and collecting different bits of paperwork to pay my myriad of taxes, then worrying at night whether I&#039;d misplaced a zero or a comma somewhere until my accountant validated the paperwork. I worked hard, educated myself, and invested in our system. I made money, but it was a miserable, paltry sum of money. It would take me four decades to buy myself a modest home. That is why the majority of Italian youths live with their parents today, even though they are 30 - 40 years old themselves. People on the benefits system were getting by just fine without working a single day, in fact they were the ones most frequently paying *me* to work for them. See something wrong with this picture?<br /><br />The vast majority of Europeans, are frankly asleep at the wheel of this train wreck. At least some Americans are bitching about the problem, at least they are aware!<br /><br />I&#039;m not the kind of person who blames things &#039;on the system&#039;. I&#039;m an individualist, I look to myself first if there&#039;s something wrong, since it usually is the case that you are the problem. However it just *cannot be the case* that I am to blame for the bullshit of the last ten/twenty years with our governments throwing money down the toilet with hundreds of half baked schemes, high taxation on workers and an enormous &#039;benefits class&#039; that sit on their asses. People themselves have been completely corrupted by high taxes, you can see it as plain as daylight in the housing estates of our countries. People have no hope or aspirations anymore. Their biggest life event is getting a new smartphone or making babies, they are literally like cattle.

They are not so much the Orwellian actors of 1984, as the characters of A Brave New World, they are desensitized by their beliefs to see the long term consequences of banning drugs such as marijuana and MDMA.

They are not real patriots at all. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13594.msg133988#msg133988">Quote from: anarcho47 on March 02, 2012, 05:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not to mention that while private-interaction violence drops off (I credit this to capitalism providing better outlets for self-interest, versus state coercion), the 20th century saw more mass murder and collectivist &quot;cleansing&quot;, along with eugenics and a hundred million sacrifices to Molech, than any other century prior.&nbsp; These were state atrocities, not individual or group actions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is all very true, but it doesn&#039;t mean that anarchism will reduce the overall rate of violence per capita within society.

				Pine - seems we agree most of the way.&nbsp; Like I said, I would settle for minarchism if that were the case, with some serious caveats for the parasite class.&nbsp; But I still hold to the belief that humans will cooperate instead of conflict when cooperation is more profitable than conflict (markets reward cooperation - i.e. continued expansion of the division of labor, economies of scale, etc.).&nbsp; Government creates conflict, especially under a moral-majority system of democracy.&nbsp; It divides society into groups and then pits those groups against each other for the resources it acquires.<br /><br />If there wasn&#039;t an oligopoly on who the Judges could be in the time of Samuel, that whole passage about what would happen if the Israelites were assigned a King would never have come to pass (it&#039;s eerie if you read that.&nbsp; 1 Samuel 12, I believe).&nbsp; Competition would have straightened out the corruption, and the entire private-law society would have carried on.&nbsp; If you are interested in studying private law and how it would function in a very minarchist or anarcho-capitalist society, I would recommend reading some of Hans Hoppe&#039;s papers and books.&nbsp; You can find them online for free in .pdf format.<br /><br />Good having this discussion.&nbsp; Hopefully many more to come :)

				no borders / free movement of labour;<br />- current employment / migration of worker laws are carefully crafted to meet hidden agenda and allow these companies to take advantage of<br />&nbsp; either loopholes or cheap labour, instead of the best interests of its voters = its tax paying citizens.<br /><br />- what would stop anyone arriving to work and live in a country that cannot support the massive influx and strain on infrastructure?!<br />&nbsp; <br />- whilst i would love to support this free movement 100% the current system doesn&#039;t work and would hate to think what effect this has on <br />&nbsp; the indigenous people if there were no restrictions, looks good on paper don&#039;t know whats practical...<br /><br />- revolutionary / entire restructure of governments &amp; world markets to allow this free movement / one world<br />&nbsp; vision to work for everyone which isnt going to happen in our lifetime if i were to be realistic about it.<br /><br /><br />

				Well, how did YOU find out about bitcoins? <br /><br />I mean ... personally I was interested as hell when I first heard about it. Teller was probably just trying to get In On It. Just because they work at a bank doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t a potential SR WEIRDO. <br /><br />Nearly Everyone is In On It, you know. Just look at how enormous this Underground market is . . .
