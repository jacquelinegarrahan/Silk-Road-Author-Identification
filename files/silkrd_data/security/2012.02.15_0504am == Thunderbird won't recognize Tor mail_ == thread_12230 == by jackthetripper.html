				Hi, if anyone could help me it would be much appreciated... I have tried emailing Tor, Thunderbird, and Tor mail about this already and the only response I received was that Tor said Tor mail was a separate, anonymous entity, yada yada yada.&nbsp; I recently (5 days ago) opened a Tor mail account to create a new Open PGP certificate that was much more secure.&nbsp; As I explained in one of my previous posts, the other was linked to my gmail address which was like a big skywritten sign saying, &quot;I&#039;m using encryption!&nbsp; I&#039;m corresponding with people on Silk Road!&quot;&nbsp; Trying to make things as secure as possible, I made this new address and key but I cannot get Mozilla Thunderbird to accept my new email account.&nbsp; I have followed the steps to manually set up my connection settings in Thunderbird on the Tor mail website exactly, have tried waiting a few days, updating Thunderbird, playing with the connection settings myself, etc.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work.&nbsp; At first Thunderbird days, &quot;Configuration found at email provider&quot; but then when I click create account it says, &quot;Cannot find configuration- is username and password correct?&quot;&nbsp; Which of course it is, and I have tried every variation as well.&nbsp; I would delete Thunderbird entirely and reinstall if I thought that would help.&nbsp; I am just at a loss here.&nbsp; If I cannot get it to work I will have to copy/paste messages and save, then decrypt, which is workable but a pain especially since I want to have a seller account eventually.&nbsp; Oh and I have a Tor browser open when I am trying to add my other account just for added measure, don&#039;t know if this matters, I guess it doesn&#039;t because you already specify your connection settings.&nbsp; Thanks.
