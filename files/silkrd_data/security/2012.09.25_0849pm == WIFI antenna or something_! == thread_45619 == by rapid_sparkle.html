				I&#039;ve heard of some of these high powered wifi antennas.&nbsp; I know C Crane Company makes some of them.<br /><br />http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ccrane.com%2Fradios%2Fwifi-radios%2Fcc-wifi-radio.aspx&amp;ei=LiFiUJStOYiO0AX2hYC4Aw&amp;<br />usg=AFQjCNF5Czet5ksFCEOlCEGesfOZdIp6Jw&amp;sig2=ZWrKLtyAazqQSUPQIv2uYg

				Welcome to SR sparkle.&nbsp; I will try answer any questions you may have.<br /><br />First comment is, why do you want such a thing?&nbsp; If it&#039;s to try and steal someone&#039;s wifi for anonymity, do you have all the basics covered?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- TrueCrypt your computer drive with a strong password<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Access SR via a VPN or remote virtual machine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Redownload TorBrowser everytime there is an update<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;- Read all recommended best practices of the security forum<br /><br />I would prioritize all of these things as more important than stealing wifi if protecting yourself is your goal.<br /><br />That said, the best wifi solution to do what you want for under $50 is this which you can buy right off amazon:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WCEWU8/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d1_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0QBSJK412P0DV3NB1VSQ&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846<br /><br />If you want to get more serious than that remember you need two things:&nbsp; more wifi amplifier power, and a better/bigger antenna.<br /><br />What else can we tell you?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45619.msg485665#msg485665">Quote from: rapid_sparkle on September 25, 2012, 08:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey guys :)<br /><br />A friend of my mine showed me long time ago a wifi antenna or something ( A antenna to receive all wifi spots listed all WIFI-ports around you in about 3 miles or something like that ) at least he told me that. he showed me that WIFI antenna and it looked like a small black box with a pedestal with a usb cable.

				get the ALFA AWUS036H USB and edit settings from default 0.1w to 1w (not legal in many countries) and marry with a decent antenna from ebay and in a good area get a 8km range!!

				c-crane makes a great Twin Coil Ferrite AM Antenna&#039;s for am radios they also sell some kinda lame wifi antennas....<br />My personal hero came up with the absolute best antenna for am - an underground loop - Nicola Tesla - a man out of time!!<br />u might want to check with MrGrey on SR if u want a sweet perfectly tuned wifi antenna with booster!!<br />u will also need Oracle VM VirtualBox installed on your comp so u can use BackTrack5.3 to crack wifi stations.<br />While I dont condone this as a all the time practice - i personally have used this 4 my own safety.

				He&#039;s saying if you pay for a VPN, then in principle your identity could be subpoenaed i.e. credit card info, address.<br /><br />However I think that&#039;s not really a concern because why would they have probably cause to get your info?<br /><br />To me the advantage of a VPN is that the traffic coming out of your house cannot be profiled as TOR traffic.&nbsp; TOR traffic profiling out of someone&#039;s house has actually been used as part of a bust before.<br /><br />Theoretically TOR traffic can&#039;t be identified because it&#039;s just HTTPS encrypted traffic.&nbsp; But in reality, there are sometimes tiny differences that can be used to identify it.&nbsp; This is also one of the techniques used to block the Internet in China.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45619.msg489824#msg489824">Quote from: rapid_sparkle on September 27, 2012, 08:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45619.msg489038#msg489038">Quote from: Christy Nugs on September 27, 2012, 09:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">vpn&#039;s can be forced to tell who u r if u subscribe $.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />what do you mean with this statement???&nbsp; :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
