				So here&#039;s my idea.<br /><br />A seller posts bitcoins for sale.&nbsp; The buyer puts it in their cart and clicks place order and at that moment the bitcoins from the seller go into escrow pulled from an account that&#039;s created when his listing is created.&nbsp; There will be a place for a moneypak number instead of an address and a place for the buyer to put wallet address.<br /><br />When the bit-coin seller confirms, thru the ordering software that doesn&#039;t exist yet, that they have firm receipt of sum promised, he clicks release bitcoins on his end and silk road sends bitcoins to buyer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Seller fee should be included in the purchase price.&nbsp; Purchase price can be hedged.&nbsp; There could be a lower SR fee for this process even.&nbsp; What do you guys think?

				If it was only that simple.<br /><br />What happens when the purchaser sends a moneypak with no funds left on it, and claims the seller emptied it?<br /><br />What happens when the seller takes the funds from the moneypak, and then claims there was none when he got it?<br /><br />What happens when a buyer sends a moneypak with funds in it, but sometime after he sent it, either the seller or buyer removed the funds from it - and both sides claim it was the other side.<br /><br />Escrow won&#039;t work when there is no way to see which party is lying in those 3 situations.

				I think trades where money is involved a admin should check the code and give the green light to both parties.

				Not trying to be a negative Nancy here - I&#039;ve put a shitload of thought into this matter, and even having admin check the number first, then what?<br /><br />First off, it&#039;s going to take time to do that, and someone will have to be available and in a position of trust to act as middleman. (Like admin isn&#039;t spread thin enough already!)<br /><br />And&nbsp; you&#039;ve effectively now added a third person who could take the funds and blame it on one of the other two.<br /><br />You&#039;d need the wisdom of Solomon to settle that - and nobody would be happy having that btc-baby cut in half.<br /><br />Maybe institute a &#039;no-dishonesty rule&#039; for both btc vendors and purchasers?
