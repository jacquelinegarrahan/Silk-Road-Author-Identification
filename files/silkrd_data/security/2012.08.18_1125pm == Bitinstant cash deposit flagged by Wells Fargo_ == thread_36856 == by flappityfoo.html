				Went this morning to Wells Fargo to make a cash deposit for a BitInstant transaction.&nbsp; Gave teller the cash (less than $500) and invoice printed out from BI.&nbsp; She spent a minute inputting the information into her system, and I could tell there was something irregular going on when she got this puzzled look on her face and kept trying to bypass something that was preventing her from completing the transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then she says &quot;Manager needed&quot; back to her manager.&nbsp; Manager comes over and looks at the teller&#039;s screen, looks at the invoice, looks at me, and then says &quot;What kind of business is this deposit going to?&quot;&nbsp; I just told her it was a bill-paying service, and she proceeded to type &quot;bill paying&quot; into whatever secondary screen or flag was holding up the transaction (I watched her type it).&nbsp; Then she had to input some kind of manager code/password (heard her telling the teller that it was needed).&nbsp; They never asked me for ID or anything else and the deposit went through and I got the BC, but it had me nervous the whole time since it was my first BC transaction and I didn&#039;t expect the extra scrutiny.<br /><br />Makes me think the BitInstant account # at WF has been flagged for suspicious activity.&nbsp; Anyone else have the same/similar issue at a WF?&nbsp; Or is Chase a better option?&nbsp; Just want to know for next time.

				Do not use the bank option.&nbsp; Use the 7-11 option.&nbsp; you don&#039;t have to talk to anyone in person.&nbsp; You only have to pick up the phone on the big ass ATM thing they have there and you talk to a money gram agent on it.&nbsp; You make up a fake name and just go from there.&nbsp; The only evidence there is using that way is the cameras at the 7-11.

				she&#039;d probably just never done a similar transaction before and didn&#039;t know what she was doing.&nbsp; thus she had to get the manager to help her out.

				virwox has the option where you can just wire the money from bank to your virwox acct.&nbsp; only downfall is that it takes 2-3 days, then you have to deal with SLL&#039;s which are an extra step, but not too much of a hassle.

				don&#039;t think you could get into that much trouble sending money to a bitcoin account. I did a moneygram at a CVS and was surprised when they ID&#039;d me. It was clearly a formality and something they regularly did. Can anyone else speak to their experiences of being carded at various places? I&#039;d prefer to use a place that doesn&#039;t card....while I think it&#039;s pretty safe you can&#039;t be too sure!!<br /><br />-mm

				I understand not wanting to be id and staying anonymous as possible. Buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, so what would &#039;the feds&#039; say to you for depositing into that account?

				FYI, I&#039;ve made Bitinstant deposits at two separate Walmart locations and neither one has asked for ID. At the Walmarts you fill out a blue Moneygram deposit slip and then see a customer service agent.

				Do not go to Chase!&nbsp; A month back or so they suspended their relationship with BitInstant.&nbsp; I got carded and interrogated.&nbsp; Then they told me the account was blocked and they could not make the deposit.&nbsp; It was embarrassing and worrisome.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have since been going to CVS.&nbsp; It is easy in comparison to the bank atmosphere, where they are trained to get into your business.&nbsp; I have yet to be asked for ID at the CVS.&nbsp;

				Remember guys. Above all else.<br /><br />There is NOTHING ILLEGAL about buying BTC!!!<br /><br />Stop self imposing so much pressure onto yourself with these transactions.<br /><br />Sounds like Wells Fargo may have had a recent change in protocol and the tellers (not doing that type of thing everyday) have to play catch up on WTF they are doing.<br /><br />Stressful maybe - but not shady.<br />

				so i&#039;ve visited my wells fargo on last saturday, and the teller had a confused and dazed look on her face... like she had to type something in. <br />she called her manager and they were talking, i heard the manager saying &quot;its just a deposit&quot; or something and everything was okay from then on.<br /><br />i&#039;m considering to start using 7/11 from now on or move to different wells fargos in my area

				I worked at Wells and let me just tell you it&#039;s full of fucking morons first of all. Secondly, there&#039;s no need to drop a log in your pants guys. Bitcoins can be used for all types of things, there&#039;s nothing illegal.<br /><br />Third - remove the invoice part of it. That likely just confuses the stupid teller. Just grab yourself a deposit slip, put the account number, and make a cash deposit. There&#039;s no need to further complicate things.

				most likely just an isolated incident<br /><br />buying BTC is 100% legal, i don&#039;t see why deposits for bitinstant would be flagged intentionally<br /><br />perhaps the teller was new<br />on the invoice there&#039;s usually an account number and routing account number<br /><br /><br />to be on the safe side, never give the teller your invoice, just fill the form out yourself

				I saw this a few days before buying my first ever bitcoins today, so I had it in the back of my mind. Went to Wells Fargo and said &quot;I need to send this cash to this account&quot; and handed the teller the bitinstant invoice. She wanted to know what it was for, and I said &quot;nothing in particular&quot; (lol, should have made something better up) &quot;but it&#039;s not a scam if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking&quot;. No &quot;flag&quot; or manager or anything like that. I think they just want to try to keep people from sending their money to Nigeria&nbsp; that 10% cut of a million dollar locked bank account.

				while &#039;none of your business&#039; is correct, at times its best to be less memorable and more ordinary. say something normal. it&#039;s to pay bills, investments, bill consolidation, down payment on a dildo factory. ok maybe not the last one.<br /><br />yes, i would NOT give the invoice that prints out - simply fill in a deposit slip,&nbsp; or better yet have the account/routing # on something you can show the teller and then take back w u when you leave other then the invoice. don&#039;t confuse the animals.<br /><br />3 - I dont know, but it is possible the FLAG your seeing is some kind of new withdrawal or transfer security that needed to be put on the account because some scammer figured out to make checks with the routing/acct # or tried xfering money out, etc. the manager saying, it&#039;s just a deposit, would tend to confirm this. <br />

				IMO, don&#039;t hand them the invoice because the way its listed, the account number blends into the rest of the info.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also recommend bitfloor to get rid of the 3.99% Fee.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone says anything to me ever, I tell them its for online poker and to thank Obama&#039;s DOJ for making me have to buy bitcoins to play the game I love.&nbsp; I also mention Diablo or Warcraft or some other &#039;nerdy&#039; enterprise and they don&#039;t even ask questions.&nbsp; <br /><br />tl;dr&nbsp; use bitfloor, say BTC is for poker or Diablo or someshit.&nbsp;
