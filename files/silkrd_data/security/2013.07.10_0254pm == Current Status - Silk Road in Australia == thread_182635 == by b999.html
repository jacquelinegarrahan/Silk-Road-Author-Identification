				What&#039;s the current status in Australia?&nbsp; Is LE clamping down hard or what?&nbsp; Just for a small time domestic buyer trying to understand risk.&nbsp; Any warnings or special precautions to take?&nbsp; Is it dangerous to use TOR from your home Internet connection, or purchase bitcoins through a bank for example.<br /><br />I wonder if LE may even prefer buyers going through SR to keep it off the streets and away from street / organised crime at leat.

				view the other threads like the one just a few threads below RE the DEA infiltrating SR and this one over in the newbie section http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182030.0<br /><br />it&#039;s worrisome that dealers would be keeping sales data, including tracking info (they&#039;d have no choice) until item is delivered and funds released which means if they get busted, those customers can be assured of a visit from their local popo

				Since when do dealers get busted and they go after customers? That seems backwards to me.

				If you always act as if you could get busted at any time, you probably never will.

IRS operates on same mentality - they audit someone, find huge irregularities and then after crucifying him (or while) they network out to any sub-contractors to see if they reported income they received from him on their returns - all in the name of terrorizing citizens into paying their taxes - and they&#039;ll crucify anyone they can, for the publicity.<br /><br />there was a big article here locally, a resturant owner was &quot;raided&quot; by IRS agents with subguns &amp; vests. They seized his resturant (padlocked it with notice on the doors, that it was under seizure by the IRS. After 3 months all they could come up with was that he&#039;d underpaid his taxes by $88,000 over the previous 9 year period (if you&#039;ve never been audited by the US IRS, they always find unpaid taxes, and usually overstate them hugely - then you have to spend at least as the amount of the exaggerated underpayment on an attorney proving they&#039;re wrong, which is a negotiation tactic on their part. Okay back to point - news article or reporter asked the IRS how was this guy supposed to pay if they had padlocked his source of income and put him out of business. Their response - we need to send a message out to other independent business owners - they were more interested in the publicity than actually capturing the taxes they felt were due.<br /><br />

				All good advice for being paranoid.. what about Australia?&nbsp; I&#039;m only talking small time use here, not onsold or even given away, strictly private use only, and never importing.&nbsp; Would LE really go after customers?&nbsp; You&#039;d hope that any half smart vendor wouldn&#039;t keep postal records around either.<br /><br />The strange thing is that I thought SR would help reduce street crime so could actually be a good thing for crime.<br /><br />There has not been much publicity around SR for a while, seems to have gone quiet, and it seems too good to be true sometimes.<br /><br />Maybe some people have problems because they get carried away, sell on, stuff like that.&nbsp; Just shut the F up, use it safely and don&#039;t get greedy.

I haven&#039;t seen anything yet to give me the impression they are prioritizing their attention on SR but who knows what they are doing. I have seen some attempts to link the recent high profile deaths associated with synthetic drugs to SR, might just be me but there has been more in the media of late.

				Of course buying domestically is virtually risk free, no customs to worry about and if you choose your vendors carefully etc. <br /><br />Re drops you will need to do some research, we do not discuss that openly on the forums.
