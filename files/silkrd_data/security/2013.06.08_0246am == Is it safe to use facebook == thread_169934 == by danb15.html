				I&#039;m almost positive the answer is no. I can&#039;t explain further because I don&#039;t know why. I&#039;m just under the impression that clearnet URLs should not be accessed on the dark web. Its not my business but why would you even want to do that?

				Facebook &amp; Gmail both hate Tor for some reason and will eventually lock you out of your accounts.<br /><br />The only way to do it is to use Tor &gt; VPN &gt; Facebook/Gmail

				Facebook knows that you&#039;re using Tor when you log in. They also know who you are (because you logged in) so you are not really anonymous. They just don&#039;t know your IP address.<br /><br />Also Tor IP&#039;s are highly abused all over the web, and I&#039;m pretty sure almost all of them, if not all of them are blacklisted on FB.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend Tor/FB.<br /><br />

				You can use Facebook over Tor, but if you create an account over Tor you will probably have to confirm with a text message, so have an anonymously purchased prepaid phone ready. The account will probably get locked a bunch of times and you&#039;ll have posting restrictions for the first 30 days, because Facebook will think you are a spammer.<br />

				I&#039;ve never had a FB and don&#039;t ever plan on getting one. Ok to be perfectly honest, I had one for less than 24 hours because my gf said we would fuck if I made one a while back. FB was terrible and I deleted it as soon as I could. I got her to seriously consider deleting hers. Lol. <br /><br />This really is my community!&nbsp; ;D

				If you made a FB account with a fake name from tor and tormail... Still bad? Can they know anything about you? I have seen it done, so no need to say it can&#039;t be.

				If you only give them fake info, then they won&#039;t know anything about, since Tor takes care of hiding your IP address and physical location. My answer above was based on the assumption that that&#039;s what OP wanted to do. However, I suppose Facebook could infer things about you from your friends, if they use real information. If they are all located in one city, there&#039;s a good chance you are too. Also, apparently there was a time when Facebook would ask people if their friends&#039; info was accurate. I don&#039;t believe they do that anymore since the media picked it up as &quot;snitching on your friends&quot;. Then again, if your friends are snitching on you to Facebook, you probably need better friends.<br />

				Yeah I don&#039;t see any reason you would want to do this. What would you be using FB for? They will still gather plenty of information based on..... every single thing you do on Facebook. Store all your conversations. If you have a real account seperate from this they can probably tell who you are just from associations and what not. Assuming anyone has a reason to care.

				The person who used FB from Tor did it to replace Tormail (very unreliable) as a way to communicate with specific persons she did not know in real life. Had no friends.

				Yeah still sketch just because the other people are all exposed unless they are all doing it the same way, in which case there are way better options than FB. But eh.

				Unless you&#039;re using a fake facebook account, no. Linking your identity on Tor to yourself is never a good idea and will destroy your anonymity. FB by itself is fine (I have one and like using it to stay in touch with people/chatting), but I&#039;m not interested in the government knowing that I on facebook = DrChong.<br /><br />I think the whole paranoia regarding facebook at all is overblown. I really couldn&#039;t give two shits if the NSA knows my favorite books or how much the weather sucked today or what I did at the beach.

If they PGP encrypted their messages, then Facebook (and potentially LE) only gets some metadata. That&#039;s no worse other clearnet services over Tor, although a little less safe than Tormail, assuming Tormail isn&#039;t an LE honeypot, because LE gets no metadata from Tormail.<br />
