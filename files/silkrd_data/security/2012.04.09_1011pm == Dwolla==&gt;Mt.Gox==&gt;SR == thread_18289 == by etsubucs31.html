				My Dwolla Deposit is suppose to clear sometime within the next 24 hours. I was planning on sending the money to Mt.Gox, buying BTC&#039;s, and sending them straight to SR. Is it okay to send them from mt.gox to SR or do i need to send them somewhere else first? Input is much appreciated!

				Yep ^^^.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just depends on your paranoia level.&nbsp; Like most security questions on here, there is no one definitive answer.&nbsp; I loved instawallet, but they appear to be having problems, but they were nice quick bounce, and safe enough for me.&nbsp; I mean, moving btc isn&#039;t illegal, so I don&#039;t sweat it, but on the other hand, if I *did* get in trouble, I wouldn&#039;t want a bunch of arrows showing I&#039;d sent money here....a lot of people don&#039;t bother with any of it.&nbsp; They just buy their btc from a vendor on here, have it sent to their main buyer addy, and buy away.<br /><br />But if this area is like the streets, the btc would be an area that I would expect LE to infiltrate, tho I don&#039;t know how.&nbsp; &nbsp;But on big city streets, the snitches were often the fences and &#039;in betweens&#039; so who knows....actually, I tend to think the drug ripoffs on here are most likely LE: they get a bunch of addresses for nothing: just post that you have some hot drugs for sale, and you want people to finalize early, and you&#039;ll get all kinds of addresses without spending a penny, then just call the local cops to watch the mail...sux but there it is...grim topic :(

				You&#039;re cool etsubucs31.&nbsp; It may take several hours for the money to appear at MtGox and when you transfer your BTC&#039;s to your wallet here, I may take a while.<br /><br />Sounds like very soon you will be making your first buy . . . best of luck to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />mouser

				Yeah, it does take about 4-5 business days, but I think it&#039;s worth it. As to the original question, it&#039;s really up to you. I&#039;ll be honest, I feel like if the cops wanted to, they could take down any single buyer on this site by going back through their Dwolla account because it is directly tied to your bank account. But I don&#039;t think the cops are going to spend the time and money it would take to arrest one buyer of drugs on a site with thousands of users. It&#039;s not worth their time. You should really be safe, just don&#039;t do anything drastically stupid.

				It&#039;s worth it because the fee is so small (seriously, only 25 cents? Dwolla is even better than Payapl in that regard), and it&#039;s pretty easy to use. Anyone can figure out how to use Dwolla without much issue. And the DEA or whoever are never going to take interest unless you&#039;re buying like thousands of dollars worth of product weekly.

				Thanks guys for all the responses. I forgot to come back to this thread after everything went through I was so excited! But to anyone who is thinking about going from Dwolla to Mt.gox to SR, it does take 4-5 days to get your money in dwolla, but once it did, it only took a couple hours to get it from dwolla to my SR account.

I do not like this at all. Now I have money I can&#039;t use in my Dwolla account and I wont be able to transfer the funds for at least another 3 weeks due to these stupid rules.

				This is stupid. I just tried using Bitinstant and I received the same message from Dwolla about meeting and maintaining their requirements of a 30 day transaction history, link to a social network, verifying my SSN and turning on their stupid fucking hub page. What gives? Is this just what n00bs have to go through? Or is this newly implimented?
