				if your cart contains items from more the one vendor you only need to put your address (encrypted) once and it will be sent to all of them, obviously if you want different items sent different places then adjust accordingly.

				look here, its nearly at the end : http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html<br /><br /><br />To make your selection, choose the required certificates in the top portion and press [Add]. You will see all selected certificates in the lower dialog portion for review purposes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Depending on the selected recipient certificate and its type (OpenPGP or S/MIME), your file is then encrypted using OpenPGP and/or S/MIME. So if you selected an OpenPGP certificate and an S/MIME certificate, you will receive two encrypted files. The possible file types for the encrypted files are found on the next page.<br />&nbsp;<br />Now click on [Encrypt]: The file is encrypted. <br />

In that case, your PGP client will try every private key that you own until it is able to decrypt the message or fails. Anyone to whom the message is not encrypted won&#039;t know who the recipients are, even if they have their public keys.<br /><br />In that way, you could encrypt the message to multiple recipients and they won&#039;t know who the others are, although they would know how many recipients there are.<br /><br />Edit: I should point out that I&#039;m talking about the GUIs. When you extract GPG4USB, you will get gpg.exe in a subfolder called bin. It is a direct port of the Linux command line client with all of the options, so this will work<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;gpg.exe --throw-keyid --armor -r Recipient1 -r Recipient2 -e address.txt<br /><br />Encrypted and anonymous.

				Yeah, here&#039;s what it actually looks like with the command line client, which is more verbose than the GUIs. I&#039;ve removed the other people&#039;s key IDs and email addresses in case they don&#039;t want that public.<br /><br />First, I encrypt and decrypt normally:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">$ gpg -r Nightcrawler -r SelfSovereignty -r astor -e hello.txt<br /><br />$ gpg -d hello.txt.asc <br /><br />You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for<br />user: &quot;astor &lt;astorx@tormail.org&gt;&quot;<br />4096-bit RSA key, ID CC925AD7, created 2012-12-19 (main key ID 706EE207)<br /><br />gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID &lt;KEYID&gt;, created &lt;DATE&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SelfSovereignty &lt;email@example.org&gt;&quot;<br />gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID &lt;KEYID&gt;, created &lt;DATE&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Nightcrawler &lt;email@example.org&gt;&quot;<br />gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID CC925AD7, created 2012-12-19<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;astor &lt;astorx@tormail.org&gt;&quot;<br /><br />Hi there!<br /></code><br />Then I encrypt with throw-keyid and decrypt:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">$ gpg --throw-keyid -r Nightcrawler -r SelfSovereignty -r astor -e hello.txt <br /><br />$ gpg -d hello.txt.asc <br />gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key &lt;KEYID&gt; ...<br />gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key &lt;KEYID&gt; ...<br />gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key &lt;KEYID&gt; ...<br />gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key &lt;KEYID&gt; ...<br />&lt;It says that a bunch of times&gt;<br /><br />gpg: okay, we are the anonymous recipient.<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000<br />gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 00000000<br /><br />Hi there!<br /></code><br />As you can see, I as the recipient would have no idea that the message was also encrypted to Nightcrawler and SelfSovereignty, even though I have their public keys.<br />

This key is then encrypted to each recipients public key and all is sent along with the encrypted text as one block of text.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the text arrives, the recipients software can decrypt the symmetric key using his own private key, and then use this to decrypt the main message. I was quite pleased when Louis explained this elegant solution to me; although I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve explained it as clearly as he did.
