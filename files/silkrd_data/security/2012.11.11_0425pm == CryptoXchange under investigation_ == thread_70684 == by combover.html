				Title: <strong>CryptoXchange under investigation?</strong><br />

				Morning all,<br /><br />I’m a small-time SR user from Australia, relying on local broker, CryptoXchange, who offer anonymous in-branch cash deposits to Australian customers.<br /><br />Living a double life in regional NSW as both a used car dealer and a BTC broker, CX proprietor ‘Ken’ seems to be an interesting character. There are plenty of rumours about his motives flying the rounds, and this is laundry that need not be aired here. Pure a soul as he may be, his company is doubtless an object of interest to the Australian Federal Police, and perhaps even the states.<br /><br />Corroborating any suspicion, despite their promises – which seem to be copied verbatim from Mt. Gox - CX is not especially resistant to Tor exit node IPs. Resistant or not, one would not like to be caught mid-brokerage if there is meaningful dough on the line. But naturally, one wonders whether it is a lack of technical know-how or a more deliberate strategy that prevents CX from being as thorough as its Japanese sister in blocking anonymity services.&nbsp; <br /><br />To my query: obviously, it is desirable for large SR transactions to separate the duties of banker, buyer and recipient, though recently for smaller orders I have been a little blasé about such rigours and presenting to the bank in person.<br /><br />Over the last few weeks I have noticed a suspicious amount of anxious stalling on the part of tellers – many asking that I repeat CX bank details several times and a few even asking for my name before putting through the transaction, slowly as ever... Some offer feeble excuses and others just look a little rattled.<br /><br />Has anybody else had a similar experience with CX? I wonder whether CryptoXchange (Kenseycol P/L) might be the subject of a LE investigation in which banks are instrumental? Could the Keynsecol accounts be ‘flagged’?<br /><br />It would be flattering to think I’m just overly cautious.<br /><br />Yours always<br /><br />

				I have nothing of worth to add.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure any of my own thoughts have already crossed your mind when you&#039;ve considered the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; I did want to say that it was an impressively well written post though; very nicely composed while still sounding pretty natural.&nbsp; You even used an accented e in blase; quite pleasant indeed.<br /><br />And with that, I&#039;m afraid my assistance is at an end.&nbsp; Pith such as mine is in high demand, and I mustn&#039;t neglect the others in need of my rare insight.&nbsp; You understand.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				I wish I had read this earlier. I deposited a couple of hundred two weeks back to buy a few btc, now they are have closed and responding to any support queries. They say they are returning all client funds,&nbsp; but I don&#039;t think so. I think I&#039;ve been scammed&nbsp; :( them&#039;s the breaks.

				Haven&#039;t had any history with CryptoXChange. <br /><br />However if you want an alternative method of cash deposits in Aus, spendbitcoins is legit. Very quick as well. <br /><br />

				I have same issue with cryptoxchange and ima little concerned.<br />I had cash in my account and the only way to withdraw that cash was to provide all my details and bank account details to make the withdraw, full name address ph number ect ect.<br />Im sketching bout it.<br /><br />They didnt reply for days and days to the support tickets i opened, untill i threatened to call the banking ombudsman and accc.<br />Prob not a smart thing but i do mine coins ect so i got a good excuse, plus it is a trading site so one could invest cash and try to get a return on the investment.<br />No i have not had any delay from bank tellers at all.
