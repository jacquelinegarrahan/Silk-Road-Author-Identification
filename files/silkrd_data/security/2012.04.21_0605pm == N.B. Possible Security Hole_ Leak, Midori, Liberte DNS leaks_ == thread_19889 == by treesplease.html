				Step 1: Restart your internet connection by clicking on it with that pop up box from the network icon in the task bar.<br /><br />Step 2: Click &#039;try again&#039; in midori on the error page claiming a socks forwarding problem blah blah blah etc.<br /><br />Step 3: Wait.<br /><br />Step 4: Repeat step 2,3 a second time.<br /><br />This nearly always works.

				I see there&#039;s some controversy over whether the wget download manager for midori cooperates with torsocks properly i.e. the DNS leaking, but that shouldn&#039;t stop you using Liberte. After all, you can just use the Tor browser bundle inside Liberte etc.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it&#039;s a bit unsettling. Does anybody else have anything to add?<br /><br />Also: look forward to a Liberte update. Neither Liberte nor Tails are perfect, we knew that already, but it&#039;s also hard to envision a static OS solution to perfect anonymity. On goes the arms race.

It&#039;s an old unix concept, you compartmentalize functionality, and then you get to use it across a whole range of programs as a building block.<br /><br />Some of what is being said on the thread is foreign to me, not being a Tor expert and all, but if some version of wget leaks DNS requests, then it very probably does so for all platforms that version of wget is used on. e.g. other Linux distros that provide the wget utility for programs to use.<br /><br />Until more is known, sticking to the Tor bundle is probably a good idea since the bundle is fully torified. I&#039;ll ask kmf about this DNS leaking issue with wget, I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll have some idea of how to best approach the problem, maybe cast some more light on the topic.

			<dd class="postbody">
				My Synopsis of thread for those less who know less geek stuff or whom are less inclined to trawl it, I will try to translate as simply as possible and remain concise if possible. Although part-geek, there are all manner of geeks, so bear in mind it is always possible I may misstate something.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Maxim Kammerer, the developer of Liberte Linux, claims that wget does not leak DNS requests and is a program safe enough to use with Tor. <br /><br />== Translation for the non-geek:<br /><br />DNS is a system on the internet which translates web addresses / URLs like http://www.google.com to the ip addresses by which computer&#039;s on the internet actually know each other.<br /><br />So; a DNS leak in the context of using the Tor network could mean that your computer has sent its genuine ip adddress to a DNS server instead of communicating with an anonymous DNS server through the Tor network, which isn&#039;t exactly smart. i.e. you just fucked up.<br /><br />wget then, is a utility for download of files from the Web. It supports http (downloading webpages), https (secure webpages), and ftp protocols (used for downloading normal files like pdfs etc), as well as retrieval through http proxies. wget is suspected of potentially leaking DNS requests.<br /><br />==<br /><br />Maxim says that this is not the case:<br /><br />&quot;My tests show that wget does not leak DNS requests when HTTP(S)<br />proxies are specified via environment variables.&quot;<br /><br />The next poster, coderman, suggets that Maxim could have made a mistake by setting the wrong environmental variables, which he implies is easy to do and suggests caveat emptor.<br /><br /><br />== Translation for the non-geek:<br /><br />Some of the default settings in Liberte may or may not have been set correctly, so that while wget may not directly be to blame for a DNS leak, the operating system with which wget interacts may have been incorrectly configured. Maxim disagrees, coderman is leery.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Robert Ransom then asks specific questions of Maxim, esstentially implying that Maxim may be overlooking potential DNS leaks from wget because he is using using an incorrect configuration.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Maxim then feels that he is being second guessed by ransom and replies abruptly. He requests specific information that wget is to blame for potential DNS leaks. He believes that because wget does not use DNS to translate hostnames (a human readable address like http://www.blahblah.com where blahblah is the hostname) when connecting to proxies like the Tor ntework, such that wget should be secure against leaking your geninue ip address.<br /><br />== Translation: Maxim says no DNS request is ever made, so there can hardly be a leak. <br /><br />Aside:<br /><br />SSS, I think this is perhaps where our misunderstanding occured. The thread is aboug wget, but Maxim says that Midori resolves DNS requests when connecting through a proxy. However, this is not the point, since it does not mean there is a DNS leak merely because a DNS request is made so long as the DNS request is made via the Tor Network. What is important is that there is a DNS leak some place.<br /><br />--<br /><br />An anonymous poster suggets that an enemy could increase the likeihood of narrowing down a search for a Tor user, because the traffic from the Tor Browser Bundle and wget can be differeniated. i.e. using wget on the command line makes you more unique. I think other posters on SR have made similar points before, warning not to get &#039;too clever&#039; with messing with your Tor configurations in case your Tor traffic behaves differently to the mainstream Tor traffic.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Joseph asks if Maxim has done a comprehensive aduit on the Tor package he&#039;s using in Liberte.<br /><br />--<br /><br />OP tries to use wireshark to work out if wget is making DNS requests directly to servers instead of through the Tor network.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ondrej Mikle claims that wget does leak DNS requests, even when the enviromental variable that Maxim mentioned is set correctly.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Maxim questions this, he sees wget connecting to a proxy on his machine. There should be no DNS leaks.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ondrej Mikle says that the DNS leak occured when using https, and there was no DNS leak with http. Perhaps another environment variable ought to be set.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ondrej and OP disuss an alternative program called curl. OP decides to use curl instead of wget.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Javier Bassi says that wget 1.12 isn&#039;t leaking DNS requests for him.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Robert Ransom comes back and says &quot;personally seen wget send my<br />computer&#039;s IP address over Tor in an FTP PORT command.&nbsp; wget is not<br />‘100% safe’.&quot;<br /><br />--<br /><br />Maxim suggests that this behavior might have occured in a previous edition of Tails for Robert and restates that wget isn&#039;t an issue.<br /><br />-- End Thread To Date --<br /><br /><br />Conclusion: Liberte&#039;s developer says wget is correctly configured with TOR for use with webpages and should not leak DNS requests. Another poster, Javier Bassi agrees that wget doesn&#039;t leak DNS requests. However several people in the thread believe his interpreation could be mistaken, e.g. Runa A. Sandvik, coderman, Robert Ransom.<br /><br />--&gt; I would not use wget until this is hashed out.<br />--&gt; SSS, you had the impression that Midori is not safe to use. I&#039;m not sure that is the case for the reasons mentioned before. I think Midori wasn&#039;t actually under suspicion for leaking DNS requests. I&#039;ll search the source code to check in case Midori happens to use the wget utility since I don&#039;t know whether it does or not (computer is slow, might take a while).

Liberte is a live usb OS, so it is unlikely to be malware related.<br /><br />Re: kmf, well, wireshark is a very useful tool, but not one I am an expert on. Deep packet inspection seems non-trivial to me. Also, one of the posters Robert Ransom has in fact said that wget does have a DNS leak, not with http or https, but with ftp. Maxim suggested Robert was using a old version of Tails, but that wasn&#039;t confirmed. The trouble is, is that although I could run wireshark and look for a DNS request containing my real ip address, is that it might be platform dependent bug e.g. version of OS, version of wget. That would explain why Maxim and Robert&#039;s results varied. Hopefully the DNS leak was a mistaken reading from wireshark though.<br /><br />Another subject: <br /><br />Why is having persistent entry guards better than randomly chosen ones? Surely using the same entry/exit nodes on the Tor network all the time increases the chance of a traffic profiling attack? LE would only have to control two computers instead of a huge number of relays. Also: is using bridges the same thing or similar to using persistent entry guards? <br /><br />

Or &quot;liberte is leaking DNS&quot; for that matter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve asked for clarification in a few threads regarding this...&nbsp; And so far all I&#039;ve seen is the original blanket statement with nothing at all to support it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve posted a few references, one form the Tor Project itself, which talk specifically about DNS leaks, and how to configure Tor with Privoxy (and other methods) so that it isn&#039;t an issue.&nbsp; As I understand it, Liberte does this automatically, and I can find nothing that indicates otherwise.<br /><br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Preventing_Tor_DNS_Leaks<br />http://securitystreetknowledge.com/?p=283<br />http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/howto-anonymous-communication-with-tor-some-hints-and-some-pitfalls<br /><br />People, please...&nbsp; If your&#039;e going to state something as fact, such as &quot;Liberte has been known to leak DNS requests&quot; or &quot;Liberte is not safe to use at this time&quot;...&nbsp; Then at least attach something to support your statement.<br /><br />I&#039;m not an expert on the subject, but I&#039;m a pretty quick study, and I&#039;d prefer to verify something myself before I accept it as fact.&nbsp; I&#039;m not claiming you&#039;re wrong...&nbsp; I&#039;m only asking you to cite the reference that prompted you to claim something as factual.
