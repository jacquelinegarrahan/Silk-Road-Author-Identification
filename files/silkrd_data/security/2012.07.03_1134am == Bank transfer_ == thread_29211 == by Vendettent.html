				So I got some stuff in the mail from a dealer that my friend knows in british columbia. He spotted me stuff 6000$ worth of stuff.<br />He emailed me 2 names and account numbers.<br />I have $6000 in cash, I have my passport and I want too go too 2 banks and send 3000$ transfers. (to two different people, one goes to each bank).<br /><br />I am only 15, would there be any problems? What can I say if they ask for a reason?

				Wait so you mean you don&#039;t believe i have money? I can obviously understand why you would think that but any advice for the bank?<br />I know it seems unusual but I already have two 3000$ stacks?<br />I should be ok at the bank?

				No reason why he couldn&#039;t have the money and received the drugs. The guy who sent it is in BC.&nbsp; He has now way of knowing. <br /><br />Don&#039;t make a transfer, simply make a deposit into the account from the bank branch.&nbsp; just say, &quot;I&#039;d like to make a depost to account # xyz for $3000 please.&quot; or something along those lines. You don&#039;t need an ID or anything else to make a deposit.&nbsp; They&#039;ll likely just believe you are an enterprising young man(which you are unless you&#039;re an enterprising young woman). They may ask you to fill out a deposit slip.

				Its all good. The first bank for 3k didnt even ask for a reason (probubly because the teller knows me).<br />On the second bank I just told the woman that I purchased a used Alienware computer for 3k.<br /><br />I came home and read the reply above me and that would of worked but never the less everything worked out great!
