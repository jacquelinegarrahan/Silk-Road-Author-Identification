				are some tor proxies blocking .onion sites?&nbsp; i tried about ten different times this morning to connect to a few different .onion links and all would time out. i have the IPs in question, but will not post them for security reasons. the only way i could connect was by rebooting tails and this time using a different ISP to connect to the tor network(worked the very first try). wonder if my ISP could be blocking TOR access.

				Yeah it&#039;s irritating me also. I try to connect to SR all day and out of 200-300 connection attempts, I can only connect a 2-3 times, MAYBE. <br /><br />This really slows down me talking to the vendors I am working with and even slows down their responses because it gives them such a tiny tiny window of accessing the SR to reply to potentially 1An easy work around to never having your encrypted data is revealed is this. <br /><br />First, there&#039;s an even safer method than to using an encrpyted flash drive.<br /><br />With TrueCrypt, you can create a hidden volume that is basically a storage volume, disguised as a file. <br /><br />What I do is.<br /><br />I have a collection of ISO files on my computer, along with several fake ones, which read as ISOs, and are made the same size as an ISO file. They can&#039;t know these files are encrypted unless I tell them, or unless they do some serious searching through all the files on my computer. <br /><br />The encrypted fake.iso volume also requires 2 key files and a complex password. Up to this point, it&#039;s unlikely for them to find the encrypted volume. You can even take this steps further by making several fake-encrypted volumes, within an already hidden one, with many fake information etc. If by some insane miracle they do gain access to this data, they can&#039;t force you to decrypt them, you can merely say you downloaded that ISO file and had no idea what it was. There&#039;s too much leverage on your side with this method for them to say you encrypted it.<br /><br />An easier way is, just have an encrypted file with a key file or 2 to go with it. When they ask you to decrypt it, tell them you deleted the key files when they began to raid your house which happen to be impossible to recreate ~ this can be absolutely anything unique that can&#039;t be remade. This leaves them in a position that is negotiate. They have no choice, and they can&#039;t charge you with distruction of evidence since you didn&#039;t really destroy any evidence. <br /><br />You could even say you have a script set up in your computers cache to delete the key file after a certain amount of wrong password entries. Maybe they forced you to log into the computer and out of nervousness you entered the wrong password a few times. Nothing they can do about this.<br /><br />Even better, with multiple key files, you can make up some crazy computer techy excuse as to why it&#039;s impossible to decrypt it now, and they have no way of proving it. If you have more than 1 key file, it&#039;s impossible for them to try every single file combination on your computer. It would be absolutely impossible for them to decrypt it by any means. This is given, they can even locate the encrypted volume!.<br /><br />If you&#039;re clever enough, your encrypted data will never be revealed. I have provided several examples above of practically foolproof ways of thwarting their attempts. If you just have&nbsp; USB encrypted with a single password, well, needless to say, you&#039;re not being very smart. You&#039;re just protecting against the average joe. <br /><br />&quot;In my country, reasonable got men killed, it is only the cautious men who survived&quot;<br /><br />When you&#039;re breaking the law, or people want to thwart you, it&#039;s much better to be cautious and anticipate any event, than to base your efforts only on what could &#039;reasonably&#039; happen0-30+ messages. With this connectivity failure, they probably can barley respond to one of those messages.

They are either serving all hidden service descriptors, or they are not serving any. If Tor is successfully connection to the network, then your ISP is not blocking access.
