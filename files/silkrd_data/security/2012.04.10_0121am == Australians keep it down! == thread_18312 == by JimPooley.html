				Lately I&#039;ve noticed more and more asking of Australians, for details about postage, lost orders, success rates etc. This doesn&#039;t worry me much, phishing for information is unfortunately a common practice on the internet.<br /><br />What IS worrying is that there seems to be a reasonable number of folks willing to volunteer their success/failure rates with no regard for WHO you&#039;re giving this information too. Fair enough we&#039;re all anonymous here, but, and this is also VERY unfortunate, the police aren&#039;t actually as stupid as they seem and they&#039;re often quite fucking clever at gathering intelligence. Even if they&#039;re not the ones doing the phishing, they&#039;re still being given information here that I personally don&#039;t want them to have.<br /><br />&quot;Total Orders Calculated: 351 (39% mention the orders orgin)<br /><br />Arrivals: 333<br />Non-Arrivals: 18<br /><br />95% arrivals<br />5% non-arrivals (could be combination of scams, lost items or seizures)<br /><br />82% non arrivals were from EU<br />18% from USA<br /><br />49% arrivals were from EU<br />22% UK<br />23% USA<br />6% ASIA + OTHERS<br /><br />stats by Jones32.&quot;<br /><br />Sorry Jones, but even if this is only a fifth of what has actually come across the border, they NOW KNOW that 351 have definitely been made, and 333 odd have arrived. I know all this info is contained throughout the forum and anyone can compile the evidence... SO WHY MAKE THEIR JOB EASY? I&#039;m a fan of helping the community and where reasonable I will give out some minor details about my SR shopping, but even then anyone who believes me with 100% faith is rather foolish.<br /><br />We have the forum so users can stay informed and it&#039;s up to the individual user to make up his own mind, using the information gathered herein!

				I am sure customs have a good idea about this already from the amount seizures they make, no need to read the SR forums, this all really small scale anyway. I think they are more interested in the larger shipments comming in shipping containers and put more effort into that, not to say that if drugs are seized in the mail&nbsp; they aren&#039;t gong to do anything about it, its just doesn&#039;t have their full attention if you know what i&#039;m saying...

				I tend to&nbsp; agree with the OP.<br /><br />No point advertising every aspect of what goes on here.<br /><br />Fair enough if something goes horribly wrong then it is a service to post on the forums to warn others. <br />(only if you can post enough details to be credible).<br /><br />People need to read between the lines and decide whether or not the system is good enough to protect them if things go wrong. <br /><br />Reading other peoples success stories might help motivate you to go ahead and order, but there is a fair amount of chance involved so<br />it is like watching someone play roulette and copying their moves. <br /><br />We especially don&#039;t need spreadsheets and statistical data thrown around here. Firstly, for security reasons, secondly because it WILL be inaccurate.

				Agreed, it must only be a smalliSH scale, however SR is surely on their radar... why wake it easy for them?

				BUMPING THIS TOPIC<br /><br />To add on to this, new vendors in Aus are welcome, but like I mentioned in another thread they need to use the forums just like buyers.<br />Vendors who advertise in the forums are always first on my list when shopping, that is if I&#039;m not returning to a previous, trusted vendor!
