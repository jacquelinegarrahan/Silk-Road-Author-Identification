				When did he order?&nbsp; Almost 100% chance he did a shitty packaging job imo.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s no way they have all the addresses compiled and sent to local police yet or am i way off base with this assumption?<br /><br />Also as far as cleaning house etc... at what level or ordering are you ACTUALLY at risk of a raid?

				I have no faith in the election process. And what you say about the media and public support being suppressed is absolutely valid and cannot be denied by any observant person. The public is being railroaded, have been for many years, but it&#039;s about to come to a head.&nbsp; In less than a decade this system will change or the government will be forced to detain and/or kill a huge number of &quot;insurgents&quot;. There comes a time when you have nothing left to loose.

				It seems like a bit of a leap to assume that he got busted for sure. But at the same time, he was one of the bigger vendors and had tons of product being moved, it wouldnt suprise me if LE didn&#039;t focus in on them/him during the 420 sale, or even before :(<br /><br />I gota agree with holly on the if you ordered now, before, ever time to cleanup and sit tight for awhile.

				Has your friend made any other purchases at all on the site? Even before the 420 sale? It&#039;s possible that another package of his was intercepted. Also, if Tony was busted, we would have heard something by now right? A huge drug dealer is busted and the media doesn&#039;t report it at all? Also, TMart has been taken down so what&#039;s the significance of that?

				So if you ordered during the 4/20 sale with your address encrypted do you think LE will still have access to the address? I&#039;m assuming Tony didn&#039;t send out the majority of the orders after 4/20.

				The fact that there have been other recent orders by this person makes me think it&#039;s not tony76. Did all of the other packs arrive, beit domestic or international? It&#039;s possible he&#039;s been watched since an initially discovered domestic/international pack, and watched since then.<br /><br />

				I ordered before the 420 sale.&nbsp; Probably around the 12th of April.&nbsp; I sent my address encrypted and received product.&nbsp; Although I will clean house (in the process of doing so).&nbsp; Did your friend receive the product or no?&nbsp; My philosophy is:&nbsp; if you get the package in a timley manner and the goods are inside your safe.&nbsp; Am I wrong or should I just shut down my own SR &quot;operation&quot;?

				Just read on the other thread that the person who received the knock did NOT order from Tony76. It could just be that LE is being more watchful of suspicious packages that were mailed on or around 4/20.

				I dont know about this ...<br /><br />I think the DEA or whoever would be tooting their horn pretty loud if they had infiltrated SR like this.<br /><br />Tony hasnt been around in about a week ... so thats 7 days of news it hasnt come out in.<br /><br />I am around Tony as well and there has been nothing in the papers up here about it either.<br /><br />Catching up buyers of a few grams here and there doesnt do nearly the damage that announcing they have taken down the number 1 seller on SR would do. It would destroy all confidence in this place.<br /><br />There must be more to this story, although I have seen other posts by Holly and they are always straight up.

				I was just wondering.&nbsp; A conservative estimate of the number of people who ordered from Tony over the week or so before the sale and the few days after the sale is probably around 70-100.&nbsp; As far as I know not one of those people has said they received anything.<br /><br />Yet, your IRL buddy, out of all those people, received his 3g&#039;s to his drop?&nbsp; And LE came calling?<br /><br />And if the stuff didn&#039;t come to his drop, it was just LE with his address investigating him, where did they get the address from, and why would they even be bothering him if nothing came?&nbsp; Someone gave them the address and they just decided to knock on his door to see if they could shake the person up?&nbsp; What would be the point if they didn&#039;t have anything to hold against him/her?&nbsp; And if they did have the product, I would think they would have taken him/her downtown, not just talked to them.&nbsp; It&#039;s one thing for something to be delivered to someones home mailbox, it is much easier to deny.&nbsp; Something coming to a PO box, correctly addressed, tends to show intent. <br /><br />If Tony did get popped, then he got popped by his own country&#039;s LE.&nbsp; They would be the ones with all the addresses.&nbsp; That would mean they had to have sent the address to other LE.&nbsp; If that was the case we would be hearing from all sorts of people, yet again, out of 70-100 (at least) buyers we haven&#039;t heard of anyone getting product and we haven&#039;t heard of anyone having their doors knocked on.<br /><br />All these threads with more and more complicated theories amazes me.&nbsp; If he got popped or sick or simply took a vacation, then we would still expect a percentage of those people who ordered BEFORE the sale getting their product, yet as far as I can tell from all the threads and polls, nobody has.&nbsp; These items would have been in the mail and at least some of them would have arrived before he left, however that was.&nbsp; LE would not have been able to intercept them in time as far as I can see, some would have gotten through.<br /><br />The old saying, &quot;The simplest answer is usually the correct one&quot;, seems to me to be the most plausible.<br /><br />From every indication Tony was setting everything up for this a couple of weeks in advance.&nbsp; He refused to send via express or priority or any type of tracked shipment, so it would take longer before people could say their package wasn&#039;t coming.&nbsp; He asked for FE from basically everybody, he opened up international. He then told everyone he was going offline to get caught up, further obscuring things. <br /><br />The simplest answer would seem to be he just completed one of the biggest scams on SR and is relaxing seaside with a Margarita with 60-100k of everybody&#039;s money.<br /><br />I would love to be wrong.&nbsp; I would love to open my mail and find a letter from Tony.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not holding my breath waiting for it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that everything didn&#039;t happen exactly as your buddy says, but are you sure there couldn&#039;t be some other reason they were bothering him/her?&nbsp; They never ordered anything else from anyone else?<br /><br />Again, this is just my opinion, don&#039;t take it personally, I&#039;m just thinking out loud here.

				If he got busted then why would he have posted that he would be back in 1-2 days?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see what purpose it would serve law enforcement to allow him to put up a message like that, also if they were going to harvest addresses, wouldn&#039;t his listings have been left up?&nbsp; ???

You may possess reasonable suspicion to think so, but to announce with absolute certainty that Tony was busted sans proof (e.g. indictment, arrest warrant, etc.) is reckless. The signal-to-noise ratio on these boards is already terrible enough to the point of uselessness. Fanning the fires of paranoia, panic, anxiety, and oh-my-fucking-god-i-better-cover-my-cornhole-cause-some-dude-had-my-address-and-i-ordered-a-tiny-amount-of-dope-and-some-anonymous-dude&#039;s-friend&#039;s-cousin&#039;s-step-son-got-a-knock-so-i-better-buy-a-cabin-with-my-btc-in-Iowa-and-hunker-down-for-a-year-getting-high-on-cow-shit-and-nutmeg-ness-so-i-don&#039;t-get-buttfucked-by-Tony-in-prison-ness is irritating because a) I&#039;m handicapped by the need to make sense (which means reliable information backing up such a specious claim and b) I have to wade through post after post of people pointlessly and publicly freaking out over shit they have zero control over.<br /><br />If you&#039;re ordering drugs from the Internet, you need to habituate yourself to the possibility that at some point you might encounter LEO. This means adopting behavior that severely reduces the likelihood that a government agent will find a reason to cuff your ass. Some of this behavior may make it slightly inconvenient to freely use your drugs, but I&#039;d rather be inconvenienced by hiding my stash that takes 5 minutes to reach than be inconvenienced by a charge of possession or intent to distribute. Dealing with either of those is definitely more than 5 minutes.<br /><br />So, until someone has a mug shot, a crime scene photo with a corpse, copy of an indictment, etc. I&#039;m going with the simplest explanation: Tony went AWOL. Maybe he pulled a legendary con. Maybe he stiffed his supplier and got his ass killed. Maybe he discovered that having to rapidly scale an illegal trafficking business was more than he could handle so he said &quot;Fuck it&quot;. I&#039;d rather lose $1000 to a con man than use it to post bail or retain a lawyer. It&#039;s also why you shouldn&#039;t gamble more than you can afford to lose. The odds of scoring here are still better than winning big at a casino.<br /><br />To summarize, unless your use of the verb &quot;know&quot; falls into one of the above two categories, don&#039;t fucking use it. And stop fucking moaning about how Tony done broke-ded all your hearts and wallets. Rolling in the muck is never the best way to get clean.

				Like all theories, leaves too much unexplained.&nbsp; Many of us ordered before the &#039;contest&#039; and purposefully laid low during it...and Tony chatted a bit, mostly letting me know I didn&#039;t need to finalize if I didn&#039;t want to....and then didn&#039;t deliver.&nbsp; &nbsp;He said he shipped, and he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; It&#039;s a scam.&nbsp; And until bunches of us get similar happenings, I don&#039;t buy it.&nbsp; The only thing all of us have in common is that our order wasn&#039;t sent...if me, and say five other people, had this exact same &#039;knock knock, who&#039;s there?

Maybe he discovered that having to rapidly scale an illegal trafficking business was more than he could handle so he said &quot;Fuck it&quot;.

				Just throwing this out there.<br /><br />Cops CAN send you illegal drugs through the mail, when working under cover.<br /><br />Cops that are undercover are protected from any drug related laws. They can smoke drugs, use drugs, sell drugs, distribute, and as long as they are undercover, they are protected by the law. And just because they&#039;re cops doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t actually sell drugs in a long-term undercover operation

				Being talked to by DHS agents is much more severe than local police or even the DEA.&nbsp; They obviously felt it was a matter of national security that if these drugs would have reached him, there would have been nuclear missiles going off all around. Watch out for those cocaine missiles.

				I think some are misunderstanding the possible outcomes and scenarios.....It really isn&#039;t implausible that the government would really sell drugs to people as they don&#039;t care and they own a shit load of them and they want money.......but what &quot;money&quot; would they rather discredit the most and get rid of?&nbsp; You have to think of it, this way there has to be some established something, someone who is legit who can make the drug aside from distribution..........local LE routinely skims money off the top of most drug markets in the USA..............just sayin.......you really think they burn all those drugs? or just show burn them?&nbsp; if its good enough I am sure they keep it......&nbsp;

The police went undercover and infiltraded the drugmarket. They imported 100.000s of kilo&#039;s foreign weed and some 15.000 kilo of cocaine. At least that&#039;s what public. They would offer it here in NL in big quantities in an attempt to map part of the bigger players in those markets. <br />The outcome of the parliamentary commission was that in the future operations like this should have approval in advance from a judge, that should not be initialized by police itself.
