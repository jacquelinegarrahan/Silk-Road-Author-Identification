				For most of us this is just daydreaming but it is still fun to think about. I can see many advantages in having dual citizenship with more than one real passport.<br /><br />There are a handful of nations out there that will allow well-to-do individuals to purchase citizenships. The island nation of Dominca, for example, requires a donation of around $100,000. I think that is the cheapest and the process only takes a couple months. You aren&#039;t required to live there or even visit to obtain the citizenship, though they do do an initial background check. But once you have citizenship there you obtain a Dominica passport and have all the rights of any other citizen.<br /><br />So once you have that citizenship you can then apply for a legal name change in Dominca, or wherever, and now you have two real passports: The original passport from your home nation with your original name and the second passport from your new nation with a completely different name, and yet both names are perfectly legal and both passports are perfectly legit.<br /><br />Oh the things you could do in the US with a second real passport under a name the US doesn&#039;t have a record of. Your US passport wouldn&#039;t even show evidence of having visited Dominica because when you do visit Dominca you would be stamped in in your Dominica passport. <br /><br />There may be cheaper ways to obtain the same level of anonymity but few are as cool. :)
