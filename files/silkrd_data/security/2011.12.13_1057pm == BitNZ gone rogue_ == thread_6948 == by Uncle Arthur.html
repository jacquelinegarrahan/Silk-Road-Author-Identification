				Anyone else using BitNZ.com and having problems? <br /><br />I deposited money on Thursday, wasn&#039;t appearing in my account by Saturday so I e-mailed the site asking what was going on.....got a response the next day from the guy saying he was leaving transactions longer so they &#039;clear&#039; (which doesn&#039;t make sense with a bank deposit)....and now it&#039;s Wednesday with nothing appearing and the guy isn&#039;t responding to e-mail.<br /><br />I also noted that there&#039;s been pretty much no purchases or changes to his Bitcoin marketplace since Friday either, and I&#039;d say I&#039;m not the only one in this predicament....<br />

				oooh. Cheers for the heads up. Let us know how you get on.<br /><br />I was just about to consider using this service after the massive headache Ukash vouchers were beginning to give me.

				An update on this....<br /><br />Looks like everything is now fine. He has indeed had some recent issues with people reversing their bank transactions on him, so he basically put a halt on things.<br /><br />Looks like he&#039;s going to leave first time users transactions longer so they can&#039;t be reversed, and trusted individuals with a transaction history he will process immediately.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done a fair bit of business through him already, so with that in mind I&#039;d suggest this is still a trusted method.<br /><br />Bare in mind your first deposit of funds will more than likely take longer than the stipulated 24 hours.

Ive used bitnz before and its worked, just not this time :/

				Haha, just deposited $400 today, hopefully everything will be OK just as Uncle Arthur has discussed already. I&#039;ll definitely keep this thread updated when it comes through tho.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6948.msg72475#msg72475">Quote from: Horror on January 02, 2012, 02:24 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I deposited over $100 on the 23rd and it still hasn&#039;t came though, </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wouldn&#039;t be super concerned, there are a crap load of public holidays in there so the natural bank transfers will be much slower.

But somebody said that UKash is a viable option, just directly converting it through someone on SR. Apparently you can get UKash at Witcholls.

I saw the thread and i think i might take the money out of bitnz when (if?) it goes in and try the ukash method because there arent many selling orders on bitnz and the ones that are there are way overpriced :/, it could change by then though. But thanks for the reply and good luck with your $400
