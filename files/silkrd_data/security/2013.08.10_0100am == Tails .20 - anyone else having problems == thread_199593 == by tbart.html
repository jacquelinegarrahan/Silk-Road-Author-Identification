				downloaded it and followed FallKniven&#039;s instructions to a &quot;T&quot; to install it to the first USB drive - computer will not boot up on it (it did fine on Tails .19), tried burning it to a DVD to burn to the usb drive, but same thing, it will not boot from the DVD<br /><br />downloaded it a 2nd time, reburnt it to the USB drive using the USB Universal installer, and still getting a window error msg that a file is missing from boot records (paraphrasing the msg)<br /><br />anyone had success with it??

				Ask on their IRC channel<br />server: irc.oftc.net<br />port: 6697<br />chatroom: #tails<br /><br />Could be a new problem, they often have booting problems with certain hardware and updates if you check their known issues page and buglist. <br /><br />Can also download Vmware or Virtualbox and run Tails .ISO you downloaded on it to confirm it&#039;s not a hardware issue (if it doesn&#039;t boot there either)

				thanks for the suggestion - turns out they do have quite a few hardware related issues <br /><br />but in going back thru FallKniven&#039;s tutorial, i went to bootice, and from there found a link to use &quot;infra-recorder&quot; to burn TAILS to the dvd - i remembered in that 12-15 hours session that&#039;s what had gotten my computer to recognize TAILS on boot - and it worked this time as well, so suspect my sony has some hardware issues with TAILS <br /><br />working fine now<br /><br />again, tks

				No it worked absolutely fine for me. <br />I was going to do it yestrday but had no blank discs so i had to borrow one from someone.<br />I burned the ISO image to a DVD-R disk, Booted up from the disk. Went to Applications - Tails - Tails USB installer, And at this point inserted by USB with the old tails 0.19 on it, and clicked clone and upgrade, This way it also keeps your persistent volume intact. <br /><br />And that was it, All working fine :)

				My shit is fucked&nbsp; &gt;:(. I spent about 2 hours last night trying to update to tails .20<br /><br />I have two flash drives both with TAILS on them. I tried upgrading but it&#039;d get to the end and say it couldn&#039;t overwrite the Live OS on the flash drive (that&#039;s the flashdrive I don&#039;t use with no persistent volume). Now that flashdrive that couldn&#039;t be overwritten doesn&#039;t work (I plug it in, select it, but it won&#039;t bring up TAILS how it&#039;s supposed to). Of course, on my normal desktop, it&#039;s not recognized as having any information on it. Is there a way I could format it and start all over then just clone and install it the other flash drive (the one I use with persistence)? <br /><br />I&#039;m compleley at a loss. Any help would be very appreciated.

				For some reason with .20 I was not able to boot from the DVD like previously done.<br />So I just got another usb cloned the running .19version onto it and updated via USB installer to .20<br />then re-started with new one and updated original. This way I also have a back up. took a little while though.

I think I just found that the issue is that there isn&#039;t enough room on the non-persistent USB. It&#039;s weird because I&#039;ve definitely ran TAILS from it before but whatever. Upon trying to clone and install TAILS 0.19 (again) to it, I got a message saying there isn&#039;t enough room on it. It&#039;s 2.1 GB so I&#039;m going to get one with more memory ASAP.

As for the VM <br />I dont know as much about them as I dont run one. But from what I understand its a sandbox that <br />has it&#039;s own IP separate from your computer. so the virtual monitor looks like a cpu but with a different ip<br />Not sure if thats 100% correct about the VM. I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong.
