				There is no special configiguration to prevent those messages.<br /><br />You should expect that a MITM attack is possible.<br /><br />That the encryption that is in use by TOR at the onion sites is not accurate.<br /><br />Your IP is covered, so you should use PGP if you want to be sure that nobody can read what you wrote.<br /><br />Covering your IP is mostly a advantage to cover your geolocation.<br />If the onion encryption is useless, because the last tornode was a evil-webserver.<br /><br />Or like tormail is catched by L.E., you should know that everything you wrote without an ecryption is to be read. Software will search for any address in the database.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you gave your real homeaddress to a seller, without gpg, your IPaddress is not needed to reveal your geolocation.
