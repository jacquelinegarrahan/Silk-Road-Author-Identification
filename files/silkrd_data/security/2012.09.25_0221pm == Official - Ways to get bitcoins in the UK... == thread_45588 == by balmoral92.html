				Sorry if this has been done before but i have been searching all over and their doesn&#039;t seem to be any clear place where all the info is so i would like everyone to put in this thread where they get their bitcoins and how they did it. I have managed to get bitcoins once so far and that was with trading ukash for them. To get ukash you simply just have to go to any shop that has the paypoint sign outside or on the shop somewhere. Whenever i have seen the sign it has been stuck to the building outside and it has two overlapping blue &#039;P&#039;s&#039;, so where you see that sign you can get ukash. You just go to the counter ask for ukash and however much you want £10, £20 etc etc... hand over the cash and you get a little receipt with your voucher no. at the bottom. <br /><br />Now once i had done that i spent at least TWO HOURS searching for somewhere to buy BTC online and was starting to think i wouldn&#039;t ever get bitcoins and that i would have to return the voucher but thankfully i found a site which i wasn&#039;t 100% on but since it was a £10 voucher i was willing to take the risk. So i placed an order with this site and was contacted by email by the guy running it and we kept in contact while the whole deal was processed and then within minutes their it was my first bitcoin! :D lol. So about half an hour later (after a quick journey up to the shop) i had purchased a £40 ukash voucher and decided to use the same site again, and again he kept contact with me throughout and was fairly quick in his responses, but this time it took a couple of hours approx. but in the end i got my bitcoins so i was pleased. Now it ended up i got about 4.60 (roughly) for £50 altogether and i don&#039;t know if that is good or not but i feel that i should of got atleast 5 BTC considering for 1 BTC it is usually under a tenner, but anyways i don&#039;t mond because i got my BTC and relatively fast. So that is really the only site i can share but i can 100% guarantee it worked. <br /><br />The site i used is : mercabit.eu <br /><br />The review thread for site : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=104357.0&nbsp; &nbsp;(including review from me balmoral92) <br /><br />Now i did this two weeks ago so i know this site still works and i am currently waiting for another quote on a $50 ukash voucher as this is currently the only working method to get bitcoins for me. I would appreciate it if everyone from the UK could share their own experiences with getting bitcoins and hopefully we can have several ways for us in the UK to get them instead of it being the hassle it is now, thank you.
