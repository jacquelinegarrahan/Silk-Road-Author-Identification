				I am new to SR, PGP, and mail ordering goodies. Is there a pgp encryption app I can use on an android phone? It would be easier and more convenient for me to do it through an android device than my desktop. And doesnt posting or mailing through SR automatically become untraceable because it is sent via tor? Since I posted this without encrypting is it advised to not use this account for any purchases? I want to be as careful and discrete as possible. I have had a silk road account for a few days and am eager to order but I am not eager to go to jail so I want to be as I formed as possible.

Don&#039;t use it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what PGP programs are available for Android, but judging from all the shitty Windows, Mac, Java programs out there, and the generally lower quality of mobile apps, I wouldn&#039;t trust any PGP program for Android.<br /><br />Don&#039;t cut corners. Use a desktop or laptop computer with the standard browser bundle and GPG for Linux, GPG4USB for Windows, or GPGTools for Mac.

				Interesting. Ive never heard android described as much less secure than windows. And if I dont encrypt posts on here does that mean I can be traced somehow? Or is encrypting just so emails cannot be intercepted? Im sorry if these are dumb questions. Like I said im only a few days old in the &quot;deep web&quot; world. I appreciate the help!

				Unless you post your name, address or some other identifying information, you can&#039;t be traced by not encrypting messages on the forum.<br /><br />You should definitely encrypt your address when you send it to the vendor on the marketplace.<br />

				If your phone is rooted, Orbot should be fine. It is a good idea to use the orweb browser with orbot too.

				Gotcha, encrypt when sending address... and encrypting is so the email does not somehow get intercepted right? I am using orbot and the orweb browser. However if I make any purchases I will do the pgp encryption and make the order on a desktop. Thanks again for the help

				Not sure what you mean. When you enter your address in the box, that&#039;s a private message on SR&#039;s server, not an email. It could be intercepted if the server is compromised, that&#039;s why you should encrypt your address.

				I would only recommend using this if you are using a version of Android that supports system encryption, otherwise LE could easily recover your secret keys...

				This is all a different language to me. How do I know if my android system supports system encryption? Does anyone have experience encryption through android?

				I had a strange issue with APG.&nbsp; It basically worked, but one of the things I tried it... got funky about. Like it said it worked, then the file wasn&#039;t there.&nbsp; I mean it just didn&#039;t exist even though the program said it did.&nbsp; Then the plaintext file I tried to encrypt, when I checked, wasn&#039;t there anymore either.&nbsp; Then even APG stopped saying the encrypted file it had created succesfully was still there.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care enough to look into it and see if it was my fault or what, but anyway... it happened.<br /><br />Android devices are better than iPhones, but it&#039;s still a locked-down operating system designed to collect massive amounts of usage data and keep control in the hands of the carriers, not the phone owners.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t bode well for security.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t trust using Tor or SR or the forums on my android device, and it&#039;s rooted and has a custom ROM and kernel even.&nbsp; I still won&#039;t trust it to talk about drugs or my lifestyle.&nbsp; Period.
