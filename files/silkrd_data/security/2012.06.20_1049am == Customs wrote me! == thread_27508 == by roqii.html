				Hi community, you might think I&#039;m new to SR, but that&#039;s just my first post on the forum!<br />I live in Germany and ordered 7g of delicious weed from Canada. I was expecting the package this week, but unfortunately I got a letter from the Deutsche Post, which tells me,&nbsp; that the customs got my package. The reason is, that there was no bill outside of the package and now they want me to charge for the tax.<br />Well..... pretty damn situation, because they require a bill of the total amount I paid for it ( ebay, paypal etc)<br />Certainly I don&#039;t got any bill&nbsp; ;)<br />I think that they will open up the package in front of me, to check the right amount of my sending, supposed I would show them a bill.<br />There is another option. If I don&#039;t retrieve it, they would send it back to Canada after 14days.<br />I&#039;m pretty confused about handling such a damn situation....<br />Anyone experienced this or a similar situation, especially in Germany?<br />Would be great, if someone could help me out :)<br /><br />Greets!

				Unfortunately you just wasted your money. Just tell them you never ordered anything and move on. If you give them proof of purchase or try to prove it chances are you&#039;re gonna get raided. Seems like they may have already opened it and just want enough evidence for a warrant.

				Sorry to hear about that sir. I suggest your order your weed from the Netherlands (or any other EU country) next time. Every time a package has to cross water (either by boat or airplane), it will likely to be inspected rather thoroughly.<br /><br />Edit: it is possible that your house address is flagged, so you might consider receiving your packages at another location, like a PO box.

				damn guys...dont need to be so harsh on the guy...look bud, your best bet is to just cut your losses, find a new drop house to have packages mailed to, and DONT use your name on those packages anymore...they are just waiting for you to come in to get arrested

				I got the same letter as you. <br />Good thing is that they don&#039;t open the package without you being present and they just send it back after 2 weeks. So just ignore the letter.<br />Bad thing is that you lost your 7g, but that&#039;s definitely better that getting involved in any form of LE investigation ;)

				WayFare Bill.&nbsp; Tell them its a gift and bring your package home.&nbsp; &nbsp; Must you still show papers in Germany?&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought you all where freed After Hitler moved to Argentina and started the war on drugs which is more profitable than any world domination plot.

				Honestly I would just get it if you know that customs haven&#039;t already opened the package.&nbsp; I&quot;m not sure how it works in germany but it sounds similar to a USA situation where if the person doesn&#039;t properly address the # of stamps on the package the receiver either pays a fee or it gets sent back to sender.

				Just send them a fake transaction of a low sum that don&#039;t need to be taxed.&nbsp; They will let it through.<br />If you get in trouble say you don&#039;t know anything about that package, It&#039;s not the same package you have ordered.

Its likely the guy you ordered from, either his packaging was shit, his packaging has been profiled, or they luckily intercepted it. <br /><br />Do you really want to err on the side of caution?

				Happy Birthday or whatever......<br /><br />Just tell them you never ordered anything, and sometimes you receive gifts in the mail from your computer friends in Canada. If they ask what would they send you, tell them you have no idea???. If they open it and question you, tell them that was a pretty fucked up joke (someone sending that to you) because you don&#039;t even smoke, and to throw that shit away.<br /><br />Or you can cut your losses and walk away claiming ignorance.
