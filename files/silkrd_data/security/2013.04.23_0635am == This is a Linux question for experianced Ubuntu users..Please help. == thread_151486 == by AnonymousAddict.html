				Now of course i know this isnt a SR related issue, but in a way it is, cause iv switched my OS to Linux, on my laptop and Im starting with Ubuntu to learn my way up to Backtrack..<br /><br />Now my issue is My Verizon Dongle broadband connection will not pick up AT ALL, it doesnt even pick up the device..<br /><br />I use the one from 2012 has a long cord that plugs into my USB port then the dongle that gives u ur access connects to the end of the cord to the diffrent type port on there.. I could just plug the dongle into my usb without the cord... I dont have a router hooked up ATM, my dog chewed thew the ethernet cord.. Dnt knw if it matters..<br /><br /><br />But iv gone to edit and tried adding my type of service and all that stuff and it will not pick up at all nothing..I have no clue what to do..I know how to bring up the Termanil but thats bout it, havent messed with it to much since i cant use the net..But i wanna get this going right so i can have a more secure OS built up from linux thn windows..Im running it from WUBI side by side with windows 7 until i can figure it out instead of a full install..<br /><br />any advice..

				Well, it&#039;s not exactly what you were looking for, but I do have some advice for you yes: stick with a dual-boot Linux/Windows setup.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used Linux as my primary operating system for more than a decade, and that entire time it&#039;s always been a dual-boot setup.&nbsp; For better or worse, Windows is virtually everywhere, and there are always little things that you end up needing it for.&nbsp; Games in particular.<br /><br />Also, Backtrack is more or less the same as Ubuntu.&nbsp; Just has a few different customizations -- like the color of the windows I mean -- and a bunch of security related packages come preinstalled.&nbsp; Ubuntu is Linux is Slackware is Fedora.&nbsp; They&#039;re just different flavors of the same kind of candy; unless you have specific needs that are met by one or the other, you&#039;re better off sticking with what more people use (which means there&#039;s more help and more active a community around the distro).<br /><br />I found linuxquestions.org rather helpful when I first started using Linux.&nbsp; Try over there.&nbsp; I&#039;d help you out, but frankly I don&#039;t have a bloody clue what dongle you&#039;re even talking about let alone whether Ubuntu comes with a compatible driver.

				Ah... I wouldn&#039;t be posting specific info like that on here!<br /><br />Regardless: <br /><br />You need to find out whether your dongle thing has a Linux driver for it. It&#039;s relatively unusual to get Linux driver issues nowadays, most of them are built in already and it&#039;s all good to go.<br /><br />Go to the manufacturer&#039;s home page and find your model, see if there&#039;s a Linux driver. It would be surprising if a piece of hardware as popular as that didn&#039;t have one.<br /><br />I had some problems with a peripheral once, it turned out that after a couple of reboots it spontaneously started working.<br /><br />P.S. I am impressed by your ethernet eating dog. Twisted pair is rather hard to chew through, you should nickname it wiresnips. If you have two RJ45 connectors (very cheap online) and a wiresnip (not your dog), you can follow a tutorial online and turn the broken cable into one or two crossover cables. This will enable you to transfer info between computers just using a single cable, no expensive gear. You could make a mini-LAN :)

				After some reading around - I believe you&#039;ll need to call Verizon and get the login information for their driver site so you can get the debian/ubuntu packages for VZAccess/Manager - This application sends specific codes to the modem to activate the connection.&nbsp; (I think)<br /><br />The forum I found was : http://www.evdoforums.com/thread15081.html , either way, you&#039;ll have to do a lot of networks &quot;hacks&quot; to get the drivers properly recognized in ubuntu.&nbsp; NDISWrapper and several other things will need to happen most likely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck to you!&nbsp;
