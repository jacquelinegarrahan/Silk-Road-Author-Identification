				I used to use get-bitcoins back in the day but haven&#039;t for a while once I started using bitinstant several months ago when I made a few purchases. I try to keep up to date on SR and BTC stuff even though I haven&#039;t been making purchases and know that bitinstant went down and no longer has the bank deposit option but now allows for walmarts and duane reades and such. I read in another thread that bitme still has bank deposits which I liked but am not particularly partial to if another location deposit works fine.<br /><br />My question is are people currently having good results with bitinstant? Where is the best place to deposit to? Also what is the difference between their pay to &#039;bitcoin to email&#039; option and &#039;bitcoin address&#039; option? Which one have you guys had the most success with? Would anyone recommend changing to bitme at this point over bitinstant?<br /><br />I have done this before so I don&#039;t need anything written in crayon or someone to hold my hand, I just need to know the method people are currently having the most successes with so I can get some more bitcoins and make some more SR purchases. I haven&#039;t used bitinstant since before they did away with bank deposits so this walmart/cvs/moneygram business is sketching me out a bit. <br /><br />Any information anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.

				I know this doesn&#039;t say much but go with your best researched option. I&#039;m always changing up my methods of obtaining bitcoins. Just research and see who&#039;s who. Sorry but I don&#039;t want my very own method of obtaining bitcoins to be exposed.

				Bitcopia.com is pretty good. No I.D. or anything needed and only took a couple hours to receive.<br />Unfortunately their hours of operation are &quot;M-Th 9AM - 7PM EST and Friday 9AM - 1PM EST&quot;, so you would have to wait for the weekend to be over<br /><br />Blueskytraders is reliable from what I hear
