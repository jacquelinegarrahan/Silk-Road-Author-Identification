				Situation: Many people use truecrypt containers to store SR related information. Usually there&#039;s a regular volume with unimportant data and a hidden volume for the actual stuff, granting plausible deniability. The data is pretty valuable, so backups are stored on different physical media.<br /><br />Problem: Some lazy person might not update the backups every time he or she modifies the original truecrypt container, so most of the time there are multiple versions present.<br /><br />Question to the crypto experts: Is it safe?<br /><br />AFAIK the hidden volume is stored at the end of the file. By comparing two copies of a truecrypt container where the hidden volume of one of them has been modified, can it be proven that a hidden volume exists? Does a modified copy of a truecrypt container pose any other vulnerabilities? What&#039;s the backup strategy of people who really know what they are doing?

				All of this is addressed in the truecrypt FAQ.&nbsp; You should go to their site and read it for more information - they go pretty into detail.&nbsp; But the short answer is yes, it can be proven that bits of the &quot;unused&quot; section of the container are changing over time, which one could use to prove the existence of a hidden volume.&nbsp; It seems like a way to get around this is to always re-write the entire unused section of the outer volume, creating new random information each time and making it impossible to know if there is a hidden volume.&nbsp; Read the truecrypt FAQ for more info.

				Ooops, I didn&#039;t rtfm enough. Thanks for pointing me there. General advice: Do never keep modified clones of containers, as not only the existence of a hidden volume can be proven (thereby losing plausible deniability), but it may also weaken the security of encryption, since the same key is used for different content.<br /><br />I recommend reading all of the truecrypt documentation, not just the FAQ. There are loads of important things to consider.<br /><br />Relevant to this topic are at least the following sections:<br /><br />hxxp://www.truecrypt.org/docs/hidden-volume-precautions<br />hxxp://www.truecrypt.org/docs/how-to-back-up-securely<br /><br />Regarding backups on USB sticks:<br /><br />hxxp://www.truecrypt.org/docs/wear-leveling
