				Somehow, I have a permanent Tor browser (bundle version) open, and when I quit it, it closes chrome but leaves the icon still hot/online.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried trashing it- I know I&#039;ll have to uninstall now...It&#039;s seriously slowing down my internet speed.<br /><br />My question is- Why is this happening, does it Mean anything, and how can I prevent this from happening again?<br /><br />Thanks for any helpful replies.! ???

				I&#039;ve actually recently switched back to Firefox from Chrome myself.&nbsp; I began seeing things that... well... just made me awfully uncomfortable, frankly.&nbsp; No real evidence of anything intrusive, but I became uncomfortable with how the program works even in Linux.<br /><br />Your problem sounds bizarre and extremely unlikely, frankly.&nbsp; Make sure you&#039;re running the actual programs you think you are, and not using a different shortcut or something (right click on the menu item, select &quot;properties&quot; and check that the &quot;Target:&quot; box is correct).&nbsp; If you really can&#039;t get it to stop, sounds like some fucked up malware that doesn&#039;t know enough to not tip off the user or something.

				Wahhhhhh&nbsp; :&#039;( I&#039;m actually not using chrome with the bundle- but apparently they are now.....Joined at the Hip!!<br /><br />I actually think this particular bundle is safari cuz I can&#039;t use Safari when I use tor. Is that really the only thing that led me to believe that? I don&#039;t remember ??? lol..

				If I were you I&#039;d uninstall and delete all of the Tor browser bundle then redownload the Tor browser bundle (firefox version) from torproject.org, and install it. It will only take a minute or two.<br /><br />And like SS said, you might have some funky malware. Might be a good idea to run a Malwarebytes too.
