				Those &quot;IBAN reloadable VISA electrons&quot; from Poland eomeone else mentioned above are very useful, they have very low limits (2000 EUR/yera, 150 EUR/day), but you can of course have many of them, they are sold here (on SR), too, buying in bulk will surely get you some rebate.

				no, sorry, no links. They were all too expensive for me last time I looked, legit or not.<br />For that kind of money I&#039;d much rather have a EU bank account, if only for a limited time.

				http://www.payoneer.com/<br /><br />Do you reckon a service like this would be any good? They supply you with a card which you can top up via visa payment. So you need a middleman like spendbitcoins.com...<br /><br />Your bc wallet &gt; Spendbitcoins (or similar service) &gt; payoneer card.<br /><br />Any good?
