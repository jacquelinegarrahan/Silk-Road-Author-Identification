				To deposit cash into an Intersango account you have to use a bank transfer, therefore you&#039;re giving them your bank account details which can be traced back to you. Does this add more potential risk or not?

Anyone with access to Intersango&#039;s records would be able to associate your identity with the Bitcoin address from which you send your coins and subsequent transactions can be traced throughout the block chain. You can mitigate this risk by running your coins through a mixing service for a small commission. (Bitcoinfog is my favourite).<br /><br />The only way to be sure of obtaining Bitcoins safely is either to sell goods or services for them or buy them using cash. You don&#039;t have to use my service for this of course (although I hope you do!) but if you do decide to go ahead, I would recommend that instead of using Intersango that you use MtGox&#039;s Barclays account and pay using cash. It would still be possible to see who made the payment by analysing security camera footage but this would require extra time and effort, so it&#039;s safer.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
