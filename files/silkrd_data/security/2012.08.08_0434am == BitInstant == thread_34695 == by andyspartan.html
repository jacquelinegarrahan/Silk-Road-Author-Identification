				Hello, I am about to buy bitcoins for my first time and ima use bitinstant to buy them. But im wondering when i use bitinstant can I just use bitinstant to get the bitcoins and have them send straight to SR? I have a friend who buys bitcoins but he uses bitinstant then has it sent to his Mt Gox account then SR. So chich would be the best way to do it?

				mt gox works with leo and will sieze your funds and ask you for real ID, so fuck them, doesnt add any security. if you&#039;re worried about security footage during deposit being used against you (or if you funded with a personal account) then you&#039;ll want to send to bitcoin fog before adding to SR account. everything else is bs.&nbsp;

				^^ exactly what he said.&nbsp; I went into a bank branch, made a deposit to a new TORwallet, then moved it to bitcoinfog, then to SR.&nbsp; It may be a little more then necessary, but for a little peace of mind, I think it&#039;s worth it.

				This in a sense is what I made another post about. I had to go in branch to make it happen.. and xfer from mtgox to sr without a fog. How risky is that procedure? Obviously I know now the right way to do it in theory but... have I already compromised myself?

				Bitinstant is the method I&#039;ve used since joining SR and it always worked great in the past, I usually had my bc within an hour of my cazh deposit. Last time I used them it took about 6 hours and a phone call before I got my coins, and I&#039;m waiting for a deposit right now that I had hoped to see about 8 hours ago. I&#039;m not really worried that I won&#039;t get my coins, but the reason I use them is to avoid hassle and scams and because they&#039;re supposed to be quick. Now I&#039;m thinking of looking into different funding methods.

				Can you just go directly from bitinstant to your SR wallet? If it gets sent to mtgox, and mtgox is pretty much impossible to use anonymously, how is that any different than Dwolla to mtgox?

YOU KNOW WHY? CAUSE ONLY YOU AND SR ADMINS KNOW THAT YOUR SR WALLET IS AN SR WALLET, to everyone else it looks like any other wallet. Once you buy something it gets tumbled internally and there&#039;s no way to link it to you and your vendor or SR in general. bitcoin fog is really better for vendors who want to cash out, everything else is just satiating your paranoia.

				Just clicked through the process until you get to the part where you have to register with Trustcash. So basically, i&#039;m assuming you make an account with a fake name and a single use email address, only to appear on camera in a bank location under said fake name buying bitcoins. Still a little sketchy for my tastes. Also, there must be a form you have to download, I thought that there&#039;s no way to download anything anonymously?
