				Most likely you&#039;ll just have USPS deliver your package to the wrong location. That&#039;s the only thing I&#039;ve run into, and it only happened for the first time in the recent past. If you choose your vendors well and generally act intelligently, you should continue to be just fine.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A few orders a month all domestic? I mean you might get busted, but I&#039;m sure if you gathered the data and calculated the odds you&#039;d have to be doing what you&#039;re doing for the next 190 years before you got targeted by leo. Even then, if you&#039;ve been safe, it&#039;s doubtful they&#039;d be able to pin anything on you.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Missing parcels or parcels delivered to the wrong address is more likely, but still pretty rare.

				My orders just went into the triple digits. I have had a few go missing, but never any love letters. I only order personal use amounts and have ordered from over a dozen countries. So when 0.25 g of coke or a couple pills from NL were a no show I didn&#039;t even sweat it. <br /><br />My point is if you aren&#039;t ordering to resell the plain white envelopes you are getting will keep coming with your regular mail. Just keep it small, get rid of the packaging right away, and only have small amounts that you could flush quick if needed.<br /><br />If the cops ever come and take me in I&#039;ll deny that I ordered anything at all. If they managed somehow to get it to court I have no record, they would have no drugs or paraphenalia found in my house, and no real evidence to use against me except a letter with a very small amount of drugs that I have denied knowledge of.

That said I know people who have ordered literally hundreds of packages over half a dozen years without a single interception.<br /><br />I think if you are importing it is more worrying than if you order domestically. In my experience, usually it is safe to say that if you import packages, you will probably get caught at some point. It probably wont be the first time, it probably wont be the twentieth time, but usually it seems people who continue to import packages eventually have one of them intercepted, and it happens a lot quicker than people who stick to domestic packages.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If you want some statistics fresh out of my ass, I would say maybe the odds of interception for a well packaged not massively sized international package are maybe 1:100, and for domestic maybe 1:1,000. This is a gross over simplification and I don&#039;t claim it to be actually true, but I think that is a way to look at the risk difference and a very rough estimate of how likely you are to have a package seized in either scenario.
