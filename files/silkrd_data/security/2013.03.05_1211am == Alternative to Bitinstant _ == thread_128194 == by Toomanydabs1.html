				Hey, wondering if you guys know of any reliable alternatives to get btc fast... Since bitinstant is down.&nbsp; I know some might suggest blueskytraders or bitfloor but both require direct deposit at bank of america, and yes im in the usa but there is no bank of america with in 3 1/2 hours of me believe it or not.&nbsp; So looking for alternative fast way to get my coins!&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated, I know of localbitcoins, but not sure how trustworthly it is... I am looking for a way to turn cash into BTC, not by credit card or something similar... though I could get a pre-paid card if any sights take that?&nbsp;

				Ziggap is acting wack for me. Whenever I click on &quot;western union&quot; as a payment method, nothing happens. So I try to go forward anyway and enter my amount. Then it tells me to select payment method. I click on western union again and nothing happens. Very frustrating...

				fuck bitinstant right now. I&#039;ve always used it, but its just not gonna happen right now. I&#039;ve gotten the low-down on bitfloor.com and it seems likes its gonna be fine. gotta set up of BofA deposit and then trade up for your bitcoins (maybe lose or gain a little) and then you can send them straight to your SR account.<br /><br />Let me know if anyone has or WILL use bitfloor.....<br /><br />Good lucks guys i know this time is weird so successful stories using services other than bitinstant will greatly help our purchases in the future without hassle!<br /><br />let me know

				Pretty sure that it&#039;s obvious that the people advertising BITSWING.com are spammer bots, which you can tell by the random name (gheidoixufiel...) Any advertisements by spammer bots are generally SCAM sites. so my bet is on that you just got scammed for $122... sorry bro.
