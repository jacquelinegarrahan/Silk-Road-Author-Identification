				I&#039;m sure greendot knows where the pak was purchased and where it was unloaded to and will give that information to law enforcement if they ask. Where it was purchased is probably pretty meaningless and I assume where it gets unloaded is only meaningful if the unloader is wanted for something and not just unloading paks.

				Like so much in security matters, it kind of depends on how serious/determined LE was/is in tracking you...it&#039;s really weird when you think about it, but we just don&#039;t know: the most important questions of all, we just can&#039;t answer...so some will go to exreme lengths--probably the best strategy--and some seem to hardly protect themselves at all, other than using tor (which is quite a bit of protection in itself) ... mostly I make sure to have instawallet.org on either side of most of any transactions I might, or might not do :)

I&#039;ve never had a problem, never had a loss, and they stay away from my quirky cpu&#039;s that seem to just not like btc...<br /><br />I keep it in the cloud, just make sure to have a good browser, say on a flash drive, with everything I need.&nbsp; The portable tor works fine, or so does liberte linux, if I want to get a more protected, then just save the website URL of instawallet.&nbsp; If I use Tails, then I need to make sure to save it somewhere so I don&#039;t loose it....but usually I get my instawallet&nbsp; and btc stuff setup somewhere else...then only use tails in transfer....
