				Not sure if I&#039;m in the right topic but here goes.<br /><br />I buy bitcoins using mtgox international wire transfer. They used to have a local Australian bank account you could transfer money into but they ended it.<br /><br />Now my bank charges money to do a transfer.<br /><br />Is there a better way to buy bitcoins in Australia? Aussies of Silk road what is the exchange site you use to buy coins?<br /><br />Thanks<br />-Coinchipz

				spendbitcoins.com/buy - you can deposit at the Big4 banks, and with the exception of ANZ which is a day wait, your coins are usually in your first wallett within 4 hours!<br />Their rate is not very competitive compared to MtGox, but they&#039;re well worth it for the ease and anonymity!

				I&#039;m pretty sure https://cryptoxchange.com/ does Australian banks. But you do have to set up an account and I think maybe ID so its not anonymous. I used spendbitcoins.com/buy the other day and its actually pretty damn easy and didnt take long at all.

				I&#039;m going to try the spendbitcoins.com method but I&#039;m not happy about going to the bank to deposit cash into a bank account called Cryptocurrecy or whatever it&#039;s called.<br /><br />It looks suspicious than doing a wire transfer to mtgox when you know it&#039;s probably done automatically by an online system. Someone probably sees the transaction and approves it.<br /><br />

				Just my two cents,<br /><br />made a huge decision to do a transfer through Drcashancarry. Dr is slow to reply since in UK however always replied and was helpful. after contemplating between him and spendbitcoins made the transaction all went tremendously smoothly. you can cash deposit or internet transfer. easy steps to follow, however he is out at the moment maybe that was my fault :P VERY GOOD RATES<br /><br />can all be done with no connection to SR which is what i did, youll notice this in his method.<br />happy buying

				I don&#039;t like to deposit large sums of cash into the common wealth bank - firstly bcoz i don&#039;t have large sums of money and secondly it&#039;s too much of a schlep. I would have to make weekly visits probly blazed to the eyeballs and probly find myself becoming all to familiar with the 5 or 6 ppl that work there, like waving to them on the street. I&#039;ve often seen the 3 tellers in the Coles where I shop. I don&#039;t want to be gladhanding and high-fiving bankers, no way! So spendbitcoins sucks for me. I liked bitpiggy bcoz u could do everything from home, but now they have closed up shop - go to their www for the tawdry details. I just joined the worldbitcoinexchange, based in Oz, but so far it seems a bit rigourous - uploading photo id etc ... There must be something better than spendbit out there? I&#039;m also a Mt. Gox member with that aurum exchange thing and getting redeemable vouchers. Doesn&#039;t anyone have any good algorhythm&#039;s in their head for an efficient australian btc exchange?

				when you go into the bank to send money to spendbitcoins do you have to give a name - show I.D?<br /><br />sorry if its been answered already<br /><br />up untill now i have wired the money straight from my bank account to Mt.Gox, its been easy and quick and i can do it from home, downside is obviously being connected with bit coins<br /><br />but up untill now i have only made very small purchases so it hasnt bothered me - i wanna ramp up my spending a bit so would love a way to get bit coins that doesnt require I.D etc..<br /><br />i also just noticed the 7/11 next door has installed a money gram machine, would be lovely if i could send money to an agency for bit coins from that !

				Spendbitcoins&nbsp; (SBC) was beyond straight-forward.&nbsp; If you quote the reference number you&#039;re given by SBC to the teller, you don&#039;t even have to scan your reciept.<br /><br />I may have done something noob, but I just put the btc&#039;s straight onto my SR wallet.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read (after doing that, of course) that some people do multiple transfers to various wallets or whatever.....is this really necessary?&nbsp; The cash is put into the bank anonymously, and put into SR which is also encrypted and anonymous.......what am I missing?<br /><br />Anyway, so far.....thumbs up for Spendbitcoins.

				tor all the way, there&#039;s sites like SR where you can open an anonymous account and use their BTC wallet. Poker sites, tumblers etc.<br /><br />But even then, unless they can actually link 1 piece to the other, having some evidence of BTC usage on your computer isn&#039;t illegal...

				I have spent a fair few long nights scouring the interwebs for the best solution.<br />My opinion:<br /><br />From what I saw with bitpiggy being down, your main options are cryptoxchange and spendbitcoins. (i prefer cash to teller method anyways)<br /><br />Cryptoxchange will land you some btc for just a touch above mt gox rate, however spendbitcoins is usually around 50c per btc higher than crypto.<br /><br />The catch for crypto is the $5 + 0.6% fee to deposit funds, and the additional 0.6% transfer fee that basically rules out mt gox as a viable option.<br />So if you&#039;re like me and only in need of&nbsp; $100 to $300 worth of bitcoins at a time, then yeah the extra like $5 or $10 for spendbitcoins is worth staying away from the exchanges.<br />With cryptos new &quot;$1000 deposit = no fee&quot; deal, in my opinion this is therefor the minimum deposit required for just trying to get a hold of some btc on there and basically rules crypto out unless you are going to play the market more profit.<br /><br />Also I was reading that the aus dollar will not be doing so well for the next 3-4 weeks, so expect similar bitcoin rates to the present.<br />It is predicted that in a month or two, the aus dollar will be closer to parity than it is now. Take note though, the btc rate is not TOTALLY dependent on the dollar exchange rate and BTC is actually a rather risky investment.

				yep I tried wbc, cba and nab (not anz due to them not displaying the reference number straight away) and wbc also caught me off-guard asking for the name and number... &quot;My name is Mr Burns&quot; ok, and what is your first name Mr Burns? - &quot;I don&#039;t know&quot;..<br /><br />I actually prefer NAB - you filled all the details in yourself on the old-fashioned slip, and just hand it to the teller. CBA you tell them everything over the counter and if you&#039;ve got a nervous voice, might not be a good idea :)

				SpendBitcoins + CBA is the only one I have used so far, and it was too easy. I had the account details and everything printed on a piece of paper, went up and told the girl I wanted to deposit X amount into this account with X reference number. She said sure thing, and before I knew it I was walking out the door (with the receipt and my original piece of paper). No questions asked. If she had of asked what it was for, I would have just said I was buying car parts off eBay. <br /><br />Definitely one of the easiest ways to go about it :D

Use public computer to setup a SR account, a tormail and follow the process on spendbitcoins.<br />2. Drive to bank. Ask teller to include my reference on the deposit. Return to public computer and if bitcoins aren&#039;t in wallet - photo (clear exif data) and send receipt through to spendbitcoins.<br />3. Possibly wait a few hours<br />4. Bitcoins are in my SR wallet and everything is anonymous - at this point or before this I can wash the bitcoins through several other places but this is only if I&#039;m paranoid/overly security conscious?<br />5. Again from public computer I can now safely use SR to make purchases.<br /><br />Is this more or less the gist of it?<br /><br />Two things I don&#039;t understand is 1.

I managed to get up and make a run for it, on the way back I managed to reach into the pouch of one of the females..it was amazing. As I reached in, it was warm (and gooey), and all of a sudden an overflow of numbers fell before my eyes, I can still see it now. I just have to find out how to get these numbers into my account.

				ok dudes i&#039;ve read most of this thread in kind of wonderment to think that so many people are getting roasted with spendbitcoins! I feel kind of embarassed to tell everyone that there is a BTC swap-shop on SR that gives you the MARKET RATE ie. the bitcoinprices.com rate or better for a deposit into commbank,.<br /><br />&nbsp;this can be done online or a cash deposit can be made. I kinda went out on a limb to try it the first time and everything was simple and pretty fast(they are based in uk so you may have to wait a few hrs for them to wake up). But as soon as they get the cash in their account they email you back and hey presto loadsa bitcoins! <br /><br />But it seriously is the best way to get a large amount of BTC......the minimum order is 30BTC, which is reasonable for any regular shopper. My first order was just over minimum way back when it was 4.40, then bought a lot more BTC&nbsp; @ 5.50 a week ago when the market rate was about 20c higher than that! <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9d9bb4dbc0<br /><br />the only problem is that they sometimes have too much demand so they stop listing.<br /><br />Questions?<br /><br />

				interesting to hear some people saying spendbitcoins.com is turning to shit.<br /><br />never had an issue.<br /><br />regarding the above post....when you add in the $30 international transfer fee ($22 i believe if done via internet banker rather that at branch) then it really is no cheaper using this method.

				when using spendbitcoins do you guys give your wallet bitcoin address and then transfer later from your wallet to SR account?<br /><br />this is how i did it my first time a couple of days ago - but i wondered if some people go straight from spendbitcoins to your SR bitcoin address?<br /><br />oh and yeah, paying $6.5 per bitcoin thru spendbitcoins felt like i had been raped....in the butt , the upside only being that it seems to be the most annonymous way to purchase them<br />

				I am considering starting my own bitcoin business, there is a demand and I have the capital. It just seems like such a jew business, making money from trading money stops me from really getting off my arse and doing prelim business plan.<br /><br />Spenbitcins is good in areas, but has serious flaws a competitor could take advantage off. <br /><br />Bitpiggy is down, they have shit rates too and the guy is american.<br /><br />Dunno maybe Jeremy is spot on and 10% is razor thing margin or maybe he is gouging because lack competition and the headfuck btc can be for people try to get in to the whole thing.

				This is a really nerdy thing to wonder, but would Jeremy need an AFSL for selling BTC?&nbsp; I assume he would as it is a financial product.<br /><br />Ooh, and I just noticed there are new options available to me.&nbsp; I can &#039;thank&#039; or &#039;discourage&#039; posters.&nbsp; I can see me using the former but I doubt the latter will get much of a workout from me as it would go against my live-and-let-live and don&#039;t-judge nature.

				Cryptoxchange is easy, you do have to set up an account but this requires no ID. The terms and conditions state the account has to be YOUR REAL NAME, but unless you plan to withdraw real $$$ eventually, there&#039;s no need at all. Make up a name.<br /><br />As for depositing cash, this is &#039;anonymously&#039; via any Westpac branch. Worst case scenario there is CCTV of you entering the bank. LE could possibly gain visuals on &quot;anyone who deposits into Crypto&#039;s account&quot; but this is a long shot, and perhaps valuable as some broad intel rather than serious evidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />The teller always asks for your name and phone number (as depositor) but again no ID is requested.
