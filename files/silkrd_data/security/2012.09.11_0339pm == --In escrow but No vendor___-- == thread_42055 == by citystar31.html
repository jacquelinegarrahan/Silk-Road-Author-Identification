				Hey guys not sure if this is the place to post but I have never had this happen in a very fair amount of transactions and know you guys are the smartest here ;) Ok so I got caught in this long talk possible 3 vendor scam (MrYellow, MJE, MMM) but thing is I have four days left in resolution, its obvious nothing was sent so thats not at question but I am asking for a 100% percent refund and for staff to cancel the order so it wont affect my stats since its for over 300 but now MaryJanesex so longer has a vendors account or rating??? Does this mean SR shut them down already and I will be getting back my money for sure or is it the opposite and I&#039;m screwed! Thanks for any help guys!!

				Ran into a similar problem with one of my first transactions here on SR. <br />Can&#039;t tell you for sure how it will go down in your case but I can tell you my experience. <br /><br />I never actually entered into the resolution process through personal request, but I placed an order and about a week later the vendor account got shut down. Not being sure what to do being so new to this whole process, I decided to wait it out and see if the product arrived. About two days later I received a message from SR staff stating that the refund had been settled, and that they were refunding my coins in full. I never did receive the product, but I did get all my coins back with no penalty to my ratings. <br /><br />Hope this helps in some way and good luck to you,<br />Ctech

				thanks guys! I figured I would get it back and not affect my stats buts its just a bitch waiting 2 weeks for resolution and then another 5 for a SR member to step in and just keeps my cash tied up for 3 weeks so really waiting for friday for that intervention!!
