				I&#039;ve tried every browser IE, Safari, Firefox,( &amp; Chrome &amp; TOR) even though the site says those two browsers are not compatible.. I&#039;ve tried logging as guest and as account and i keep getting this message. &quot;We are experiencing a problem with one of partners, please try again later&quot; I&#039;m not the only one either a lot of people on social media (twitter fb etc..) are bitching about the same problem message to the bi support social media accts.. My question is has anyone been able to get coins through cash deposit on NEW site yesterday? It seems as if some people can get the site to wrk and some cant.. this sucks man i hope this shit resolves or i might go crazy!

				Having the same problem here as well.&nbsp; Very frustrating since before their &quot;upgrade&quot; I never had a single issue with transactions.&nbsp; Hopefully they clear this mess up soon.

				It seems like the guest checkout for cash deposits is broken. (I&#039;ve been seeing many reports of that) I did a verified transaction over the weekend and it worked.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering at this point if they will ever bring back &quot;guest&quot; cash deposits. I can&#039;t help but wonder if it&#039;s currently &quot;broken&quot; deliberately.

				I would have thought the same thing @ above post, but my man FlyHigh used the guest option just a week or so ago, and reported no issues.
