				If you&#039;re really having a hard time synching the blockchain, and really don&#039;t want to do it unless it&#039;s through Tor anonymously -- I think you&#039;re best option is to just use Multibit instead. It&#039;s supposed to be all setup &amp; synched within minutes, and it&#039;ll let you store &amp; send BTC and all of that.<br /><br />&quot;MultiBit&#039;s primary focus is being fast and easy to use, even for people with no technical knowledge. It has a YouTube channel to help you learn the software, and includes helpful features such as an exchange rate ticker. MultiBit supports many languages such as German, Spanish and Greek. MultiBit synchronizes with the network much faster than Bitcoin-Qt and should be ready for you to use within a few minutes. This is a good choice for non technical users who want an easy to use experience, especially if you use a Mac.&quot;<br /><br />Check out multibit.org -- the &quot;official&quot; bitcoin-qt and bitcoind aren&#039;t actually doing anything that&#039;s useful for you, if I understand what you&#039;re interested in accomplishing. You can initiate and receive transactions fine w/o validating the proof-of-work that miners report, which is the biggest part of a &quot;fully functional&quot; client.<br /><br />Just for clarity: you can&#039;t possess or transfer BTC without a bitcoin address. A wallet is just a collection of bitcoin addresses that you have the secret keys for.&nbsp; So you have to be tied to at least one address at some point somehow, since otherwise you have no way of actually having the BTC you want to store.

				Just a heads-up: <br /><br />If you are downloading the blockchain onto an encrypted drive it will be slow. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s because you&#039;re not really just downloading the blockchain. As well as downloading the chain, your PC is using your HD to verify the transactions it contains. If your disk is encrypted, that process is slow.<br /><br />Me, I keep my Bitcoin client, set up to be portable and connecting over TOR, on an encrypted USB stick along with the TOR browser bundle. Whenever I need to update the blockchain (let&#039;s say I leave it for a while, then I have a week&#039;s worth of blocks to catch up on) what I do is copy the entire Bitcoin directory onto my (unencrypted) desktop, run it on there, then when the chain&#039;s up to date, copy it back onto my USB stick and securely delete the copy on my desktop.<br /><br />It is far, far, far quicker this way.

				Yeah, I totally was only focusing on the first half of his question for that entire pre-edit post, lol.&nbsp; If it wasn&#039;t clear, by importing the secret key into blockchain.info (just for example), you won&#039;t have to synch.&nbsp; Online wallet services are always synched because they&#039;re always running, so no waiting if you go that route when you want to send the coins. And nobody can steal them from the online wallet until you import the key, but after you send the BTC, there&#039;s not much left to steal anyway, right.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=69290.msg577293#msg577293">Quote from: BenCousins on November 09, 2012, 10:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />man im confused now<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>LOL!&nbsp; Sorry bro.&nbsp; Basically, you had it right the first time. I went off on a tangent.&nbsp; But if you don&#039;t want to wait for your client to synch, just export your key, take that exported data and import it into an online wallet service, and voila, instant transaction-ready wallet at your fingertips.

				Yeah, they could. But what I mean is just use your own local bitcoin client to generate the bitcoin address, that way only you have the secret key stuff in your wallet.dat -- and then when you eventually want to make a transaction using one of those addresses, export your secret keys using your local bitcoin client, and then import them into, say, blockchain.info&#039;s wallet service (I think blockchain.info is about as safe &amp; trustworthy as it gets, but don&#039;t quote me on it).&nbsp; Then right after you import the key, make your transaction, and there won&#039;t be anything left to be stolen from you.<br /><br />Basically, if you&#039;re having that rough a time synching your copy of the blockchain... I can&#039;t think of anything else that would work out except just sitting back &amp; waiting for it to finish.&nbsp; Just an alternative for you -- feel free to ignore the whole idea :)

This is Windows 7.<br /><br />1. Buy a USB stick with minimum 8GB<br />2. Download Truecrypt, and install it in portable mode onto the stick<br />3. Use Truecrypt to create an encrypted volume on the stick, 7GB or so in size. Use the hidden volume option if you want - it gives you some plausible deniability (in the UK they can in theory prosecute you for refusing to tell them your password).<br />4. Mount the encrypted volume as a particular drive letter such as Z:<br />5. Into this encrypted volume, download/unpack the TOR Browser Bundle, Bitcoin, and any other apps you like to use to do what you do like Keepass<br />6. Configure Bitcoin to be portable. Do this by placing the Bitcoin files into a folder on Z:, let&#039;s say we call it Z:\MyBitcoinFolder. Then in the root of Z:, create a shortcut to Z:\MyBitcoinFolder\bitcoin.exe and then alter the shortcut properties so its target says Z:\MyBitcoinFolder\bitcoin.exe -datadir=Z:\MyBitcoinFolder\MyBitcoinDataFolder<br />7. Disconnect from Internet (turn off wireless, unplug ethernet cable etc)<br />8. Start Bitcoin by double-clicking the shortcut<br />9. Go into its settings, and tell it to connect via SOCKS4 proxy, IP 127.0.0.1, Port 9050<br />10. Reconnect to Internet<br />11. Fire up TOR Browser Bundle<br />12. Wait for Bitcoin to download the blockchain. This will take time - particularly when you get to the end of the blockchain. (See my earlier post in this thread for a way to do it quicker. You&#039;ll have to alter your shortcut if you take my advice in the post above, and you will need shredding software.)<br />13. Ensure each time you want to use Bitcoin, you mount the Truecrypt volume as Z:, or your shortcut won&#039;t work.<br /><br />Job done.<br /><br /><br />Now if you want to get really fancy (stop reading here if you are not a geek like I am), you can partition the USB stick to create a small (500MB) partition onto which you can install Liberte Linux. You now have a bootable Liberte partition which contains your GPG and TORified browser etc and all the other advantages Liberte gives you... and your Bitcoin client is in the other, larger partition. Everything on a single USB stick! You need to get a copy of something like EASEUS both to create the partition, and to swap between them being primary and logical each time you want to use one or the other because Windows only recognises 1 partition on a USB stick.

				Forget about the blockchain. Use Electrum. You can sync your wallet on multiple devices (they have an Android client too). And learn what a brainwallet is.

				The two biggest reasons to use Electrum:<br /><br />Electrum doesn&#039;t need to download the blockchain. The client connects to one of a network of electrum servers that store the blockchain. The client just sends the signed transactions to the servers to be broadcast to the network. So it starts up and syncs within a few seconds.<br /><br />It uses a deterministic wallet. Basically it generates your wallet from a 128-bit random seed. If you have this seed recorded, you can regenerate your wallet anytime anywhere. Even better - the 128-bit seed is represented by a string of words. All you have to remember is a 12 word string of random words and your wallet and all your bitcoins is effectively stored in your brain - hence brainwallet. Pretty fucking cool.<br /><br />So in your case with your concerns, you can have your Electrum client running on a non-persistant VM. Every time you start it you enter in your 12 word seed and generate your wallet. Do your transactions, close it down and poof there is nothing stored anywhere. What&#039;s that officer? No, I&#039;ve never heard of bitcoin officer...

As I understand it - it is very important to use bitcoin through tor when you *spend* bitcoins. This is because the node that first registers a bitcoin transaction can be recorded. This could allow an IP address to be associated with the spending of specific bitcoins which might provide evidence for LE.&nbsp; If you look at the site blockchain.info you can see the record of the IP address that originates a transaction along with an attempt to guess its geographic location. <br /><br />If you simply connect to the network to download the blockchain your IP address is probably also being recorded by some goverment agencies , but since its not associated with any specific bitcoins presumably it would not be of much use beyond showing that you do use the bitcoin software. You can download the blockchain from various places (eg. bitcoincharts.com) and then run your client always through tor if you are really paranoid. <br /><br />People on here often say &#039;bitcoins are not illegal&#039; while this is true at the moment, I think its safe to say a pretty large part of the current bitcoin economy involves &#039;illegal&#039; transactions of one kind or another. Thousands of people are not buying small amounts of bitcoin so they can purchase alpaca socks. You can be sure big brother is collecting all the info they can on bitcoin including every IP address that ever uses it.

I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t think you need to worry about it until you actually make a transaction -- then your IP will be on file.&nbsp; Prior to that, I don&#039;t think anybody is keeping track of who&#039;s running what. Each bitcoin client has 8 connections. Each one of those machines in turn has 8 connections. And so on. There are... fuck, I have no idea how many bitcoin clients in the network. Thousands I would think. So that&#039;s what, 8 to some undetermined power connections they&#039;d have to keep track of at all times?&nbsp; Nah... I just don&#039;t buy it.<br /><br />When you make a transaction, the IP that reported the transaction gets stamped in the recorded info, so for your peace of mind you&#039;ll want to be Tor-anonymous when that happens. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re 100% protected after doing what you describe though. I would think so, but... I&#039;m not a security expert.

You need to generate a new Electrum wallet, after which I&#039;d just transfer the coins over to it and forget the old wallet.<br /><br />Install electrum, generate a new wallet.

Memorize them.<br /><br />Transfer your btc to your new electrum wallet.<br /><br />If your computer with the electrum client explodes or something and you need to restore your wallet on a new computer, you install electrum and enter in that 12 word seed and your password. Your old wallet is regenerated. Your backup was in your head.
