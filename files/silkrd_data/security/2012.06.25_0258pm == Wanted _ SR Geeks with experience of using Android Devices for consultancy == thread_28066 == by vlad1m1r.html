				Dear all,<br /><br />As those who have am currently working with another seller (who is based in the US) on writing a guide for devices running Android 4.0 to use SR. <br /><br />Specifically our goal is to write a step by step guide on how to install the necessary applications such as Orbot, Orweb, Bitcoin wallet software (I&#039;m thinking BitCoinSpinner) and of course securing the device through using the built in encryption option. I would like to avoid having to &quot;root&quot; the device if possible as from what I&#039;ve seen this would be difficult for people without strong IT skills but if you think there&#039;s a strong case for it please let me know.<br /><br />We&#039;re confident we can write the basic instructions ourselves but we would like to run these past more experienced users in our community to make sure they represent the best way to secure an Android device. We also believe an open and honest approach like this will <br /><br />The reason we are doing this is that we hope to start selling Android Tablets via SR in the coming weeks and want to encourage users to secure them themselves. This prevents any accusations of tampering and encourages SR users to take responsibility for their own safety. <br /><br />I would be more than willing to pay you a consultancy fee (I&#039;m thinking around 5 Bitcoins, please let me know if you think this is fair) - naturally if you agree the guide is suitable for the purpose for which it is intended then all you need do is say so and we will list your endorsement in the &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; section. <br /><br />If (as I suspect) you have further thoughts of your own then I&#039;d ask you to edit the draft as you see fit and return it with your comments.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am aware there are other ways to access SR safely and I also know that an Android device properly secured would be a convenient way for many newer users to do so, especially as the OS and the Apps we plan to use are Open Source. <br /><br />The first draft of the guide itself should be ready in around ten days. We plan to start offering Android devices for sale in the next 2 - 3 weeks.<br /><br />If any member of the SR Geeks interested in being paid for their expertise and their endorsement, please send me a message or e-mail me at vlad1m1r@tormail.org.<br /><br />Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />V. <br /><br /><br />

				For any naysayers I&#039;d like to point you in the direction of the great Arthur C Clarke when considering the above plan:<br /><br />Like all revolutionary new ideas, the subject has had to pass through three stages, which may be summed up by these reactions: (1) &#039;It&#039;s crazy --- don&#039;t waste my time.&#039; (2) &#039;It&#039;s possible, but it&#039;s not worth doing.&#039; (3) &#039;I always said it was a good idea.&#039;<br /><br />-- Arthur C. Clarke. &quot;Next---The Planets!&quot;, Report on Planet Three. 1972<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />V.

The guide could end up being quite extensive and trying to democratise it too much would take forever!<br /><br />I also want to separate the proverbial wheat from the chaff - the SR Geeks group are naturally people with expertise in this sort of thing - I freely admit I&#039;m not which is why I&#039;d like to have their views on what should be added or changed. <br /><br />If you want to review and edit the guide, please feel free, you&#039;ve obviously a solid knowledge of this sort of thing. I&#039;d be happy to send you the draft version. <br /><br />As for the Consultancy fee I realise that many SR users are happy to lend their advice for free but it may be the case that parts of the guide have to be rewritten extensively - I also want to be able to list the names of eminent users who&#039;ve edited the guide in the &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; section and since I&#039;ll be profiting indirectly from the sale, it seems only right to me you should all receive something for your trouble.<br /><br />When the final draft of the guide is ready I&#039;ll list it on SR to be available for download for free and will create a post announcing this. Obviously if any users spot any inconsistencies they can flag them up and we can do a revised edition but I&#039;m hoping this won&#039;t be necessary since the finest minds on SR will have helped create it! :-)<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />
