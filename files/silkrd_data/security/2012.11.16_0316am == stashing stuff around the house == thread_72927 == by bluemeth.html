				wheres the best place to stash stuff around the house so that if LE came knocking they wouldnt find it?<br /><br />iv been doing a lot of thinking on the issue. i like those stash cans, but i feel like LE will have already caught on to them<br />iv seen a stash pot plant. where its an actual pot plant, but the bottom comes off and it has a stash cavity<br />apart from that iv thought that hollowing out table legs might be a good idea

				If you have central air, tie whetever you have to a string and put it down a vent. Celing tiles work well, the under side of fish tanks.. The freezer, high kitchen cabinets.. i could go on..

				Locations depend on you.<br /><br />If its something you&#039;re stashing for a while, consider digging a hole and burying your stash in a glass jar with one of those silica gel bags inside.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always subscribed to the school of thought that less hiding spots = less chances of being discovered.<br /><br />If you have a garage, consider stashing your junk inside a dusty old rubbermaid container thats full of other junk that you KNOW nobody is going to rummage through for another decade or two.<br /><br />Clean out your old paraphernalia regularly.<br /><br />Never leave snorting straws/foils/pipes/baggies ANYWHERE.

Toss all your stems, sticks, and if you got it, even bud into a grinder and scatter it throught the yard. Dogs will hit everywhere and anywhere.

				Well first off the cops won&#039;t be knocking on your door unless you consider breaking it down knocking&nbsp; :D. Then they&#039;ll detain you and bring in the K9 unit and those bastards can sniff through anything, mason jars, airtight containers, etc. Throwing stems and small amounts of shake around the edges of the room can throw the dogs off or they could just pick up a bigger scent (your stash) and go straight for that. The best way is to simply just not have your stash in your house, but then again you have to ask yourself, why would the cops raid my place?

				Ok not to be an ass.&nbsp; But if you can&#039;t stash something in your own house, whats the point of having it?&nbsp; <br /><br />Now if your saying your looking for stash ideas so your wife or kids don&#039;t find it.... now were on to a discussion.&nbsp; BUT<br /><br />LE has no reason to serve a knock warrant on your door unless your selling.<br />Bury your stash is kind of silly, unless your not going to need to get high for several weeks.<br /><br />The AC vent won&#039;t work if the dog smells it.&nbsp; Again it all goes back to point number 1, why would LE be serving you?

				They would have reason to raid your house if they received information that you had a quantity that wasn&#039;t deemed for personal use - i.e. intent to distribute. Which is generally considered 10g&#039;s and above isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />

				if you live in an apartment building there are a lot of places you can put stuff... again if it&#039;s weed it&#039;s hard to not keep it in your place.. if your making enough pay a neighbor for an extra key to just keep your stuff there.&nbsp; High cabinets almost made me fall over..&nbsp; you will have to do better than that.&nbsp; It&#039;s true they don&#039;t hit every scare inch inside of a place but until they&#039;ve found something, and when they are pretty sure you&#039;ve got something, it&#039;s going to be pretty hard to throw them off a big stash of weed.&nbsp; If you live someplace rural outdoors could work out very good right?<br /><br />There are pretty good no smell bags and containers.&nbsp; If you put it high in something like that and kept the dogs confused(is that possible?) then you might be able to do something inside.<br /><br />I guess a big question is can you throw dogs off a big stash by just having shake everywhere?

				I&#039;m tellin&#039; ya I think best would be like if you had fake trim over a doorway or some sort thing like that built into the house and then a compartment lines with smell proof stuff.&nbsp; All this light bulb stuff doesn&#039;t make sense if you&#039;re talking green.&nbsp; Green needs to be smell proofed.&nbsp; Granted sometimes when they don&#039;t find anything they don&#039;t call in the dogs either!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Don&#039;t ask me - I&#039;ve just heard of it.

				First off, if law enforcement is busting your door in and searching with dogs, they&#039;ve got a lot more evidence to go on. That being said, there is absolutely no harm in taking extra precautions.<br /><br />Off site is obviously best, it&#039;s hard to find what isn&#039;t there. That being said, it&#039;s a pain in the ass to walk or drive to your stash every time you want to get high.<br /><br />I took a walk around my home, and came up with a few ideas. <br />&nbsp;- take something apart, like an old tv, vcr, and hide things inside - it seems every appliance I look at has massive amounts of space inside - DO NOT do this with anything you plug in, this is a huge safety risk. Cut the power cord inside the appliance so if it is plugged in inadvertently, it will remain dead.<br />&nbsp;- pull at pieces of trim, some will come off easily, and there are little, sometimes large voids behind them. glue some magnets to the trim and wall to allow for easy repeated access.<br />&nbsp;- hollow out a book if you have a decent size library you can hide it in<br />&nbsp;- inside a stash can if you can stash that can in your kitchen. <br />&nbsp;- pull out drawers from your dresser or wardrobe, there is space behind the drawers you can utilize.<br />&nbsp;- attic access - lift lid, lift up insulation and tuck things in - be careful, this could be an inhalation hazard<br /><br />Roll one up and get creative, man! Nobody has the perfect answer, or that&#039;s what LE would be looking for.

				Two things guys...<br /><br />1. For marijuana : I have heard and have experienced success with &#039;oven bags&#039;&nbsp; (the kind you cook a chicken in and are really loud crinkly plastic) are the best for sealing in smells, just use at least three and get the ones without little vent holes of course. Use disposable gloves too, new ones out of the packet that have never touched any weed because otherwise you will cross contaminate the outside of the plastic bags if you use your un-gloved fingers.&nbsp; Put the gloves on after placing the weed in the bags (without ever touching the outside of the bags with either your fingers or a surface that has previously had weed on it like a bench top) and tie up the tops of the bags one at a time, not all three together. Melt latex gloves after use in a bottle of mineral spirits AKA mineral turpentine, turpentine substitute, petroleum spirits, solvent naphtha (petroleum) or white spirit or if you got nitrile gloves, use acetone to melt em... if you have vinyl gloves, use acetone or petroleum... just keep a bottle used only for melting gloves and when its saturated take it to your local waste disposal drop off point and pour it right in.<br /><br />2. For powders :&nbsp; I&#039;m told that Sniffer dogs are not trained to smell drugs. They are trained to smell the residual solvents &#039;usually&#039; left on the drugs post &#039;work up&#039; I.E. toluene, acetone etc. I think it is probably true because firstly, most drugs in their pure form are virtually non volatile and therefore actually have no smell. Secondly, it makes sense that the dogs wouldn&#039;t be trained to sniff &#039;actual&#039; drugs because that would be seen as &#039;cruel&#039; and dangerous for the dogs to continuously sniff drugs everyday while training.<br /><br />To make your stash solvent free you can either use prolonged gentle drying in an oven or make a vacuum desiccator (best). <br /><br />Sometimes lazy cooks will produce batches that will be difficult to remove all the solvents from because the solvents may be mixed in amongst other liquids that are not very volatile like left over P2P from the reaction... in such cases and in other similar confounding circumstances consulting Uncle Fester&#039;s Books will help as he has a few pages dedicated to problem solving ( via providing detailed clean up methods) poorly &#039;worked up&#039; gear, I.E. melting crystals, waxy looking crystals etc etc... there is too much info to write it up here.

I&#039;m pretty sure those bags are mylar, which had the lowest rate of &quot;leakage&quot;.&nbsp; A good example is the Mylar balloons you see at the store, you know, the type that say &#039;HAPPY THANKSGIVING&quot; in the shape of a turkey or someshit. Those are mylar, which is why they can stay inflated for so long, very little seepage through the material, whereas a regular rubber balloon has billions of microscopic holes that leak whatever is inside overtime.<br /><br /><br />I am a bit confused by melting the gloves. Why melt the gloves? Do you see just tossing the gloves in the garbage as a risk and your thinking that by melting them in mineral spirits it will further eliminate &#039;Stuff&#039; for dogs to hit on? If you&#039;re paranoid, I guess that would be one more step to ensuring a smell free delling.<br /><br />I
