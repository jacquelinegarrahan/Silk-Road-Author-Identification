				hi there, there is a scammer who uses known high ranked sellers names, messages you on here then says he / she does better prices of the sr and gives this address<br /><br />http://dfx3opddg6fcdxvi.onion/<br /><br />First it was posing as Pfandleiher, using the nick Pfandlieher, messaged me on here, I almost fell for it!<br /><br />this is the msg I got after I left a good review<br /><br />-------------<br />For the review =]<br /><br />http://dfx3opddg6fcdxvi.onion/<br /><br />Off SR I do better prices.<br />;)<br /><br />Shh..<br /><br />Rollin&#039; and feeling nice. &lt;3<br />Don&#039;t share.<br />-------------<br /><br />now the site has changed its vendor name to Aerie after Pfandleiher became aware and warned all his buyers ... never heard that new name on here, probably a none sr vendor who has established customer base on the tor network and he / she is posing as them?<br /><br />dunno but beware of the above link and beware of the address<br /><br />Just looking out for yall<br /><br />Kind Regards, bbuyer

				Thank you for this post.&nbsp; I was came across this site on an onion domain searcher, and saw pfiendlers name next to his website and was contemplating using it. Fortunately i&#039;m not dumb enough to do it without looking into it first.

I get -Karma for posting reviews and marquis tests. Showing that vendors are selective scammers. And I also get downboated for pointing out wrong advice in harm reduction forum. Mods: you should be ashamed of backing this up. I really don&#039;t give a fuck, but in Drug Safety of all places? <br /><br />There&#039;s shitty people on here. A lot of them. don&#039;t take it personally. +1 for you to compensate.
