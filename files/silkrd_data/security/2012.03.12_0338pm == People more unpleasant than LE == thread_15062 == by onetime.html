				Mornin!<br /><br />I am sure this is not news to the veterans and those not as dumb as me, and I don&#039;t want to scare anybody, but maybe it helps<br />someone:<br /><br />LE is not the only danger you should be aware of when dealing with drugs.<br />I have bought some (really not much, a few oz weed max, plus very little amounts of other things, no H, no C, no LSD) drugs<br />here (from very reputable vendors, I am sure they have nothing whatsoever to do with what follows) and some of those I<br />gave away for free to some friends, some I &quot;sold&quot; without any gain for me, just to help out a few people who didn&#039;t want to<br />buy online for themselves for various reasons (mostly because they felt they didn&#039;t understand the technical side of things well).<br /><br />Now I was contacted by a friend of mine who is (or was) rather well connected and who, because he knows me and how stupid I can be,<br />asked around a bit and was informed that at least one of the people I gave something to couldn&#039;t keep their mouth shut and are<br />already on the list of people who you definitely don&#039;t want to be on any list of. The kind of people who don&#039;t care about search-warrants,<br />etc., I amsure you get my meaning.<br /><br />Point is: Think a bit about your &quot;local underground&quot;, too, when thinking about LE.<br /><br />Stay safe!
