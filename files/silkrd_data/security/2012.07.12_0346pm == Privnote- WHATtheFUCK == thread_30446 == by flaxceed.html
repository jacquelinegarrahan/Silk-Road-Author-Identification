				So it happened.&nbsp; I made a privnote and the recipient told me it was already read.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Has anyone else had this happen?&nbsp; Isolated incident?<br /><br />Please- no lectures on PGP vs. Privnote.&nbsp; Not interested.&nbsp; I use PGP with everyone who uses it with me, and I am confident with the security that it affords.&nbsp; I also understand that Privnote is not a good substitute.&nbsp; But my question is- WTF?&nbsp; Has this happened to other people too?&nbsp; Just how rare is this?&nbsp; Who read it?&nbsp; Where are the vulnerable points?&nbsp; Sure SR staff could read it but I can&#039;t imagine they are interested in doing that.&nbsp; It would be more exciting to watch your own hair grow.&nbsp; LE?&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; This was sent via the SR message system.&nbsp;

				He could have accidentally double read it (refreshed it)? You could have accidentally clicked the &#039;destroy it&#039; button? Jesus could have intervened and decided you didn&#039;t need Viagra?<br /><br />Really there&#039;s no way to have any idea, it does tell you when it was read. <br /><br />Was it right as you wrote it, implying you accidentally read it? <br />Was it 0 minutes implying he accidentally refreshed it?<br /><br />Nows the time to step up security, learn GPG, lay low for awhile:<br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br />

				Always encrypt your privnote links. That&#039;s what I do, when I use them. And I hate to use them.

				OK I know im leaving myself wide open by asking but why encrypt the link?&nbsp; why not just encrypt the whole message?

				Actually, that&#039;s what I also do. If I ever use privnote, and I make sure it is a very rare occurrence... now, at least. But if I ever use it, I encrypt whatever message it is to contain with PGP before hand, then I encrypt the privnote link itself, then I give the encrypted link to whoever it is that needs it. When the transaction system isn&#039;t an option due to vendor inexperience, this is how I get my comforting illusion of security.

				I&#039;m not sure why people use privnote at all, after this incident I&#039;m surprised anyone would use it again. Why take the risk at all things like this occur? Madness.
