				Just stumbled across this new exchange. Looks like it has a lot of features. It doesn&#039;t seem like it supports annonymous cash deposits like Exchangebitoins but it looks promissing.<br /><br />Does anyone have experience with this exchange?

More info in their bitcointalk.org posts <br /><br />

				I too just joined Crypto - I like the user friendly platform but am wary of the measures, so much of the web design on these BTC are so tacky it&#039;s hard to tell how legit they are and if 3rd parties are sucking your details.. Would it be bad idea to send a large amount at once? and would they be alarmed if they just saw me putting money in and sucking in out as soon I get BTCs?

				I&#039;ve used them for a couple months, and haven&#039;t had any major complaints. The largest deposit I&#039;ve made is $150 though. I use bitinstant to get cash into my account. I created the account with a fake name/email address, and I deposit cash, so there&#039;s little (or no?) way to tie it to me. They have a really nice user interface.

				I&#039;ve used them for about 2 months and have deposited up to around $1000 and let it sit without a problem. This site is the best site for exchanges in my opinion because they offer so many options... I signed up on Tor and I&#039;ve only accessed it on Tor. Great site.
