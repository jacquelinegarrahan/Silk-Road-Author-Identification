				I have a friend who knows the person busted, he said they were busted via unrelated investigation and then police linked them to SR because they seized and analyzed computers then found unencrypted documents with SR info on them.

				I&#039;m very sorry to hear about this. Please be safe people. Please do not leave unencrypted evidence of your SR commerce.

One of my good friends got MDMA pressed by these guys and he knows the details of the case better than I do. He says the investigation did not start from SR but through unrelated means. The police only found they were involved with SR after seizing their computers. I don&#039;t know if the documents they found included customer shipping addresses or only usernames and the URL or what, but they definitely found unencrypted documents which is how they knew they were involved with SR.

				I hate to say it but it looks like another case to prove how important internet, and computer security is if you decide to become a vendor.&nbsp; Many of us will always fly under the radar because we buy small amounts for personal use and have no information for the police that they couldn&#039;t find themselves by opening an account on the forums.&nbsp; It&#039;s when you take that leap into becoming a vendor or a reseller that you instantly put yourself in the line of sight of LEO.&nbsp; Keep things small, light, and personal and deal with only with people you&#039;ve built a connection and buisness relationship with over time.&nbsp; If you decide to resell or become a vendor then please take the time and do your homework and make sure you and your files are 100 % protected and never ever get lazy.&nbsp; Everyone&#039;s security depends on it.&nbsp; Stay safe people.
