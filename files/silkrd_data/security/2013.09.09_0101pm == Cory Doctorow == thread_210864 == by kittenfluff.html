				Interesting article by Cory Doctorow on The Guardian website today:<br /><br />&quot;How to foil NSA sabotage: use a dead man&#039;s switch<br /><br /><br /><br />The more we learn about the breadth and depth of the NSA and GCHQ&#039;s programmes of spying on the general public, the more alarming it all becomes. The most recent stories about the deliberate sabotage of security technology are the full stop at the end of a sentence that started on 8 August, when the founder of Lavabit (the privacy oriented email provider used by whistleblower Edward Snowden) abruptly shut down, with its founder, Ladar Levison, obliquely implying that he&#039;d been ordered to secretly subvert his own system to compromise his users&#039; privacy.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t really matter if you trust the &quot;good&quot; spies of America and the UK not to abuse their powers (though even the NSA now admits to routine abuse, you should still be wary of deliberately weakened security. It is laughable to suppose that the back doors that the NSA has secretly inserted into common technologies will only be exploited by the NSA. There are plenty of crooks, foreign powers, and creeps who devote themselves to picking away patiently at the systems that make up the world and guard its wealth and security (that is, your wealth and security) and whatever sneaky tools the NSA has stashed for itself in your operating system, hardware, applications and services, they will surely find and exploit.<br /><br />One important check against the NSA&#039;s war on security is transparency. Programmes published under free/open software licenses can be independently audited are much harder to hide secret back doors in. But what about the services that we use – certificate providers, hosted email and cloud computers, and all the other remote computers and networks that we entrust with our sensitive data?<br /><br />Ultimately these are only as trustworthy as the people who run them. And as we&#039;ve seen with Lavabit, even the most trustworthy operators may face secret orders to silently betray you, with terrible penalties if they speak out.<br /><br />This is not a new problem. In 2004, American librarians recoiled at the FBI&#039;s demands to rummage through their patrons&#039; reading habits and use them to infer terroristic intent, and at the FBI&#039;s gag orders preventing librarians from telling their patrons when the police had come snooping.<br /><br />Jessamyn West, a radical librarian, conceived of a brilliant solution, a sign on the wall of her library reading &quot;THE FBI HAS NOT BEEN HERE (watch very closely for the removal of this sign).&quot; After all, she reasoned, if the law prohibited her from telling people that the FBI had been in, that wasn&#039;t the same as her not not telling people the FBI hadn&#039;t been in, right?<br /><br />I was reminded of this last week on a call with Nico Sell, one of the organisers of the annual security conference Defcon (whose founder, Jeff Moss, told the NSA that it would not be welcome at this year&#039;s event). Nico wanted me to act as an adviser to her company Wickr, which provides a platform for private messaging. I asked her what she would do in the event that she got a Lavabit-style order to pervert her software&#039;s security.<br /><br />She explained that her company had committed to publishing regular transparency reports, modelled on those used by companies like Google, with one important difference. Google&#039;s reports do not give the tally of secret orders served on it by governments, because doing so would be illegal. Sell has yet to receive a secret order, so she can legally report in each transparency report: &quot;Wickr has received zero secret orders from law enforcement and spy agencies. Watch closely for this notice to disappear.&quot; When the day came that her service had been served by the NSA, she could provide an alert to attentive users (and, more realistically, journalists) who would spread the word. Wickr is designed so that it knows nothing about its users&#039; communications, so an NSA order would presumably leave its utility intact, but notice that the service had been subjected to an order would be a useful signal to users of other, related services.<br /><br />This gave me an idea for a more general service: a dead man&#039;s switch to help fight back in the war on security. This service would allow you to register a URL by requesting a message from it, appending your own public key to it and posting it to that URL.<br /><br />Once you&#039;re registered, you tell the dead man&#039;s switch how often you plan on notifying it that you have not received a secret order, expressed in hours. Thereafter, the service sits there, quietly sending a random number to you at your specified interval, which you sign and send back as a &quot;No secret orders yet&quot; message. If you miss an update, it publishes that fact to an RSS feed.<br /><br />Such a service would lend itself to lots of interesting applications. Muck-raking journalists could subscribe to the raw feed, looking for the names of prominent services that had missed their nothing-to-see-here deadlines. Security-minded toolsmiths could provide programmes that looked through your browser history and compared it with the URLs registered with the service and alert you if any of the sites you visit ever show up in the list of possibly-compromised sites.<br /><br />No one&#039;s ever tested this approach in court, and I can&#039;t say whether a judge would be able to distinguish between &quot;not revealing a secret order&quot; and &quot;failing to note the absence of a secret order&quot;, but in US jurisprudence, compelling someone to speak a lie is generally more fraught with constitutional issues than compelled silence about the truth. The UK is on less stable ground – the &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; lacks clarity on this subject, and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act allows courts to order companies to surrender their cryptographic keys (for the purposes of decrypting evidence, though perhaps a judge could be convinced to equate providing evidence with signing a message).<br /><br />When the NSA came up with codenames for its projects to sabotage security products, it chose &quot;BULLRUN&quot; and &quot;MANASSAS&quot;, names for a notorious battle from the American civil war in which the public were declared enemies of the state. GCHQ&#039;s parallel programme was called &quot;EDGEHILL&quot;, another civil war battle where citizens became enemies of their government. Our spies&#039; indiscriminate surveillance programmes clearly show an alarming trend for the state to view everyday people as adversaries.<br /><br />Our world is made up of computers. Our cars and homes are computers into which we insert our bodies; our hearing aids and implanted defibrillators are computers we insert into our bodies. The deliberate sabotage of computers is an act of depraved indifference to the physical security and economic and intellectual integrity of every person alive. If the law is perverted so that we cannot tell people when their security has been undermined, it follows that we must find some other legal way to warn them about services that are not fit for purpose.&quot;<br /><br />Found here:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/09/nsa-sabotage-dead-mans-switch<br /><br />Interesting idea, that I definitely think anyone working on open-source encryption projects should be implementing.
