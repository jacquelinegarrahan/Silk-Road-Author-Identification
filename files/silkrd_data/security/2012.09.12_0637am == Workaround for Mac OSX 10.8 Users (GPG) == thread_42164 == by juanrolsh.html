				I apologize in advance for this question. I am a fresh customer (long time browser) to SR. I am sure this has been asked before somewhere in the SR Forum, but I am wondering if anybody has found any other program or a workaround for GPG for Mac OSX 10.8&nbsp; (mountain lion) users. Am I just screwed? From what I am reading it goes against my safety, as well as the vendor&#039;s if I am not using encryption. <br />Thank you for your patience.

				Huh?<br /><br />Grab the GPGTools installer - https://www.gpgtools.org/installer/index.html . Works fine under ML.

				The regular build, I was using it last week. Switched to Liberte in VirtualBox now for better security and isolation, everything is in there rather than the Tor bundle and GPG stuff all over the OS that requires tidying or importing/exporting keys if I want to be discreet.

				I&#039;ve had a few glitches with Mountain Lion. I read on the developer&#039;s website that they are planning a ML release soon which will take care of the incompatibility with the Mail app, and hopefully fix the bugs that are in the current build.

				Thank you for all of your replies. GPGTools states on their website that their program isn&#039;t compatible with ML yet.&nbsp; If you all say it is working for you, than it must be a user issue. Like I said, I am new to GPG...So I guess I am going to have to go through some training, haha. If anybody has any good suggestions on threads for idiots like me that basically hold your hand and walk you through GPG usage, it would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise, I will use the search button like a normal person.

				Hi Guru,<br /><br />Very nice explanation.<br /><br />One of the problems that I have which I attribute to the lack of full ML compatibility is sometimes when I write my message in TextEdit and then encrypt with one of the keys on my ring, I copy the encrypted message to the vendor and I get back a response that they could not open it. This doesn&#039;t always happen even though my procedure is the same each time. I just noted in your instruction to use plain text and not .rtf, so could this explain my problem? If so, why does it work some times and not others?<br /><br />Also, when copying a vendor&#039;s signature on SR, do I need to make sure to strip away any formatting on my paste to TextEdit so I can then add the signature to my keyring? I have a clipboard app that allows me to do this, but I haven&#039;t thought about this until I read your post about plain text.<br /><br />Thanks for any help ...<br /><br />

				Oh, tits, you just fixed my problem, thanks Guru!

I know for a fact that when I&#039;ve had difficulty decrypting messages over the years, the ones that gave me the most trouble were always emails full of HTML crap, usually arising from the sender using brain-dead software like Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express.
