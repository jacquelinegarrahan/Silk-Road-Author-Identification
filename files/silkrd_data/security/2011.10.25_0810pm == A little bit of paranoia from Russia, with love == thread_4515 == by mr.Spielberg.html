				Hello, I&#039;m from Russia. This is my first time I&#039;m going to buy something here. And I was a bit of paranoia that I was put under surveillance, and when my order comes in the mail and I&#039;ll come take it, the guys from the Federal Drug Control Service, or FSB, catch me, and I will go to jail. I&#039;m going to order just one stamp of LSD, but here in Russia, we prefer not to joke with such things, For such things people could be sent to prison for three years. They can arrange with me show trial. What should I do to ensure maximum safety for me? Thank you.

				In Soviet Russia, Internet surfs YOU<br /><br />lol OK, all jokes aside...LSD is pretty much undetectable and the safest drug to ship by mail. You should also read the Buyer&#039;s Guide on SR..<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide

(Google a tutorial)<br /><br />2. Download the TOR Browser Bundle, and extract it onto the hidden layer of Encrypted USB drive. (you will use this to access SR)<br /><br />3. Download PGP Portable, and extract that to your hidden layer of encrypted USB drive. Google a tutorial on how to create your own Public key, and how to import sellers Public keys. you will use this to send encrypted messages (ie your name and address) to sellers so that only they can decrypt the message.<br /><br />4. Download Eraser Portable, and extract that to your hidden layer of encrypted USB drive. Get in the habbit of performing regular FREE/UNUSED DISK SPACE wipes of your USB drive and your computers main C: drive (do it after you have cleared your browser cache/history/cookies). Tripple pass is what I stick to.<br /><br />5. Create a .txt file on your hidden encrypted USB drive and keep the SR url on there, never access SR through links on the internet.<br /><br />I personally NEVER transfer BTC&#039;s from exchanges to a wallet stored on your USB drive or hard drives.<br /><br />6. Instead, access www.instawallet.org through TOR (everytime you type in www.instawallet.org and hit enter, it creates a new anon wallet), save the wallet address and URL in a&nbsp; temporary .txt file on your encrypted USB.<br /><br />Transfer your BTC&#039;s to the instawallet, leave them there for at least 4 hrs, which will in effect make those coins harder to trace.<br /><br />Create another 2 instawallets (its a good idea to click the &quot;Use a new identity&quot; button on the TOR control panel, so the other two wallets look like they were created by different people, split your coins unevenly between the two new instawallets. Again leaving them in each wallet a further 4 hrs or so.<br /><br />Then deposit those coins into your SR wallet address, I usually create a new wallet address for my SR account for each instawallet, just so that its not blatently obvious that BTC&#039;s you bought were split up only to be perfectly merged into the same wallet 3 or 4 wallets later.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was written by Lazy Cloud in another similar thread. As for receiving the letter.. Maybe you can use someone&#039;s else name and address? LSD is hard to detect, I wouldn&#039;t worry too much.
