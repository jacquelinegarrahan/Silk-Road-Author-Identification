				I am considering becoming a seller on this site and wondered how sellers managed to get GBP from their bitcoins. I understand it is possible to use services to receive the money via western union and other money transfer services, however these require identification in order to collect the money. Is there any way to do this anonymously?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help.

				I use Intersango. I send the bitcoins from my wallet here to the wallet on my computer, then to my intersango who do a transfer into my bank account almost immediately. I use the wallet on my computer stage just so intersango aren&#039;t directly aware where the bitcoins are coming from. <br /><br />As bitcoins can be traced publicly there&#039;s no other way to make it completely anonymous unless you use a third party cashing service available here. (Sellers who will transfer your bitcoins to cash for you), although they take a high fee and are always a risk.

This in itself isn&#039;t a crime of course but you may be subject to further investigation and it may affect your ability to get financial services in future.<br /><br />It&#039;s also possible to buy cash in the mail for Bitcoins. I offer this service on my seller account myself on Silk Road and would be happy to set up a custom order for you if the need arose. You can also buy precious metals such as gold on the website Coinabul.<br /><br />Of course this is only a primary stage if you want to launder your proceeds - in order to enjoy them fully you need a way to make them appear legitimate which involves starting a legal business and layering your proceeds with legally earned money.<br /><br />I have a small amount of experience with this but the person you really want to talk to is Limetless who does this on a large scale and also is a fellow Brit.<br /><br />Any other questions please ask&nbsp; - also if you need any Bitcoins to get set up as a seller on here, please send me a message. I sell them to folks in the UK in exchange for cash in the mail.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />
