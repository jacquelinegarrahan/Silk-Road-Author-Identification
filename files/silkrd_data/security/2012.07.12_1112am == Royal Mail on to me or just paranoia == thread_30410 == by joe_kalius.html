				Recently when waiting for a parcel to arrive I&#039;ve been the first one from our house to be collecting the mail and I&#039;ve been noticing some odd shit goin down.<br /><br />1. A lot of mail recently hasn&#039;t been post marked by the post office, mainly packages from here that ARE arriving but other post aswell<br />2. A lot of mail has been scribbled on or marked in some other way in which aint normal<br />3. I took a piece of a housemates mail and it had clearly been opened and re-sealed<br />4. Girlfriends mail arrived opened (not even bothered to re-seal)<br />5. A letter arrived with the address on full show but not the name (little plastic window envelope jobby,) the envelope has been peeled back to check the name<br />6. Mail delivery times shifted a while back for a couple of days (this could be due to sickness or holiday or what not)<br /><br />I use a Pseudonym when ordering and it&#039;s always been fine - this shouldn&#039;t be a problem, our bills are constantly under different pseudonyms and the residents here are constantly changing. I have used this pseudonym countless other times for a variety of things!<br /><br />What I&#039;m thinking is that either - A piece of mail has been intercepted NL - UK due to a vendor not being stealthy enough (first time I&#039;ve used this vendor and first time I&#039;m having issues) and now they&#039;ve upped their screening <br /><br />or<br /><br />Posties been naughty and has been stealing our mail, which isn&#039;t unheard of - we&#039;ve had all sorts go missing in the post from DVDs to Gig tickets.<br /><br />Mods please edit or delete if you feel any of the above is compromising&nbsp; myself further<br /><br />

				Any post that originates from, or is going to, north of Yorkshire is apparently slow. Which I believe, as a reputable vendor sent me some weed on Saturday, and it&#039;s still not here!&nbsp;

				are you waiting for a NL to UK package that hasnt shown up ? its normally 3-4 days but i have waited 8 before<br />i noticed recently that my domestic orders dont have a postage mark on them,,is this normal ? i then received one and it was marked but thats been the only one,never took much notice until i joined SR<br />my postie is grreat,never had anything nicked or go missing,always tip him at crimbo for his good work<br />lots of mail does get nicked though so as you have already stated that things get stolen in your mail i wouldnt be suprised if thats whats happened,,i would use a different address if poss,last thing you want is your goods getting nicked by the&nbsp; postie !!
