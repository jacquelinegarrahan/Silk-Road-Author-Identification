				I&#039;m very interested in using Blue Sky Traders as a method of transferring cash into BTC, but I had a few questions that from experience some of you may be able to educationally answer my question.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be heading to a Bank of America tomorrow at some point to deposit a large sum of money.

				I would think that as long as it is well under 10,000 USD, then you shouldn&#039;t run into any issues.

				Just remember buying coins is not illegal.&nbsp; I use bst all the time,&nbsp; all 20&#039;s, some 50&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are stressing over nothing.&nbsp; Just go in, do your thing, walk out.<br /><br />I was worried my first time, but literally there is nothing to be afraid of, they don&#039;t ask you questions, you fill in your info on a out of state deposit slip, hand them the money, you get a receipt and walk out.&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple as pie, you will see.

				$2k is not a large sum of cash.&nbsp; As long as you aren&#039;t bumping up on that magic $10k mark, you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; Just go do your business, the bank doesn&#039;t give a shit.<br /><br />And next time don&#039;t announce your plans to the world.

				from my experience in banking working at a bunch of institutions.....cash deposits 5000 or under most places dont even bat an eye. 8000 or under if they think your shady they might put the transaction aside (but this is rare) 9000 to 9999 just below the 10k limit you bet your ass they will look into it. specially if its going into a random out of state business account.<br /><br />But&nbsp; 90% of the tellers doing your transactions hate there job just as much as you hate your 9 to 5 they will rarely take the time energy or extra work to look into something that may or may not be shady. the owner of the actual bank account is more at risk of &quot;getting looked into&quot; than you are. <br /><br />Just play it cool act like you know what your doing and dont look like a drug addict....I do most my dirty banking while in a suite on my way to work at a different bank. <br /><br />If you give them reason they will have reason if not then its just another 1 of the 1000&#039;s of transactions they do every day.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used bitcopia for purchasing BTC and was pleased with them.&nbsp; He&#039;s through Wells Fargo though, so if you don&#039;t have an online account or branch nearby it won&#039;t work.

				I&#039;m not trying to boast the amount of cash&nbsp; im depositing.. I&#039;m more concerned with going in with 20&#039;s. Any legal way to get 100&#039;s for 20&#039;s?

				I didn&#039;t think you were, I&#039;m just saying that $2k in ANY denomination isn&#039;t really worth a second look.&nbsp; Well, maybe if you brought in $2k in change but they&#039;d be more pissed at that than wondering about lawbreaking.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dead set on swapping them for 100s, just go to random stores and see if they&#039;ll cash you out.<br /><br />The most I&#039;ve deposited is $6k cash before, and of that at least $4k was 20s.&nbsp; Multiple times I&#039;ve had $1k-3k exclusively in 20s.&nbsp; 20s are BY FAR the most common bill other than maybe 1s, 98% of ATMs only give out 20s... for all they know you collected rent from roommates, all of whom took cash out of the ATM.&nbsp; Just make sure to count &#039;em twice and it also helps to face them all.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had multiple cashiers thank me for facing all the bills.<br /><br />Seriously, I think you&#039;re worrying about nothing.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t act all sketchy and it&#039;ll be fine.

				2k should be ok.&nbsp; They&#039;re not required to report cash deposits until you hit $3k.&nbsp; Just do a little social engineering (business casual is always good) &amp; don&#039;t look sketchy.

				Today I took in a deposit around 7500 all in 20&#039;s from a guy that smelled like the aftermath of 420 and clearly a weed dealer.....My branch manager (who was standing next to me and is a huge tight ass) didnt even think twice about it....Your fine. Mind chatter is your biggest enemy it will psych you out and cause you to trip up.

				5,000$ is actually the cut off for a suspicious transaction report; however sums lower can generate a report which will be sent to FINCen. Google the recent FINCen guidelines for Bitcoin, if you need a citation.

				Bank tellers honestly don&#039;t give a fuck. THey see this every day. Every day. Every day. They are desensitized by it, so don&#039;t even trip. It&#039;s just business as usual. If they happen to know your buying bitcoins, just advocate how you believe they are a good investment and believe they will hit $500 by june.
