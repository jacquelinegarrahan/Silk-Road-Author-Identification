				Is this a smart idea? Have been doing it for several days now, and it seems pretty smart to me. I cracked their password and I&#039;m using Tails and all, is this a good idea for being safe?

				i would call it a wash.&nbsp; it isn&#039;t a silver bullet that&#039;s for sure, if there was enough suspicion or reason for someone to look into your own home internet service and that physical address, they might not be too keen to just drop their inevstigation if they found some old relatively benign guy at the other end of the wire connecting you to the net. people know wifi is insecure and that them darn kids can break in and use it even if you set a password, shoot even polices know that!<br /><br />there are a number of ways to secure a wifi network, and some of those ways are more complex and potentially secure than others. while there are a number of attack vectors for darn near all of these tools/mechanisms for securing a wifi network, maybe all of them. many of the most common ways that people secure their wifi networks using a password that is set on the wifi access point or router/wifi combo device that you need to know to get access typically means that anyone with a little bit of tech know-how will be able to get on the network without being told the password.<br /><br />For security I tunnel my clearnet traffic through a SOCKS tunnel: https://calomel.org/firefox_ssh_proxy.html makes it easy to use bank sites and things like that where they only let you use it if coming from an ip from a specific&nbsp; country.

				I won&#039;t comment on what you are doing :p but if you are going to, make sure you change your wifi cards MAC address to something random. Perhaps even use the vendor code for a legit manufacturer (obviously not yours!) and then random for the last part.

				I feel a little lucky about this because I just got a new computer and haven&#039;t accessed my actual wifi with it yet. Darn kids man. <br /><br />Sorry if I offended any of you old fuckers, I don&#039;t get why a grandma needs 10mbps download speed. Must be all that high def old on young porn she watches.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />You know, that&#039;s a good idea. Anyone want 4 cars that don&#039;t run, a frog that flips coins from it&#039;s tongue to its belly without the use of batteries, a 72&quot; one ton TV, or any lamps from the 1920s? Will ship stealth.

It&#039;s the hardware address of the individual part and it can be tracked to you, especially if you purchased the adapter or device containing it with anything other than cash. <br /><br />If you are doing more than buying small amounts of drugs for personal use (or if your country takes that seriously), change it often to make it difficult to identify usage patterns or timing, and avoid connecting to any websites, services, etc that can be used to profile or identify you.

				It&#039;s too late to change the MAC. The router already knows it and will probably store it forever.

				Good point! I forgot that OP already connected to the router at least once with his default MAC. Since the neighbor&#039;s AP is not unsecured, just accessing it without authorization is already a crime. Yeah, I know that in some jurisdictions connecting to open wifi is illegal too, but at least that gives you some plausible deniability.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not doing anything &quot;serious&quot;--only OP can know what that is relative to his area--then it&#039;s really not a huge deal. If the laptop or wireless adapter (if it&#039;s not built in) was purchased recently and with a credit card, I&#039;d limit any kind of illegal activity over that hotspot as you&#039;ll be the first person they&#039;ll look for if anything comes back to that ISP account.

				Craigslist with cash, actually. <br />Yeah, nothing serious. Just a user, not a seller. Good info, though. Thanks for the tips! For all LE knows I&#039;m a part of their household, that I can tell at least.
