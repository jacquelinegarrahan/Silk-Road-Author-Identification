				You want your TOR browser located somewhere hard to find. Not just sitting on your desktop.<br /><br />You need to think about how the BTC are making their way into your SR account (and out of it if you&#039;re a vendor).<br /><br />You need to encrypt your communications with others on SR using PGP.<br /><br />You need to research vendors before you enter into a transaction.<br /><br />You need to ensure the address you&#039;re sending your goods to is a secure one.<br /><br />You need to ensure that any people who know you&#039;re an SR user are people you can trust. This includes talking about the site online or IRL, and it also includes ensuring no-one&#039;s looking over your shoulder when you&#039;re browsing the site!<br /><br />There. You have several things to start looking into and learning about. Good luck, and stay safe!

				Some more things that came to my mind:<br /><br />You need to either block History Writes or History Reads in both Tor and Non-Tor-mode (Torbutton settings)<br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t keep your GPG keys where people with access to your computer can find them (like the %appdata% folder), i made a post somewhere about how to move them on windows.<br /><br />There is also a difference between Firefox with Tor and TorBrowser, the latter contains additional security fixes, but average SR users probably don&#039;t have to worry about that.
