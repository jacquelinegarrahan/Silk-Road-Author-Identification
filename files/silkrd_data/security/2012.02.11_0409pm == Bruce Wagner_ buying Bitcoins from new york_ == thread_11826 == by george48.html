Bruce Wagner was for a time the public face of the new electronic currency. He was the go-to guy for journalists looking for insight into bitcoin. He even began running his own online TV network which attracted multiple sponsors. Now, things have begun to unravel for Wagner. MyBitcoin was a bitcoin bank Wagner had heavily promoted on his shows. One day, it vanished from the Internet. When it returned, MyBitcoin claimed to have been hacked and that it was only able to refund 49% of deposits. Wagner&#039;s early promotion and history of involvement in equity stripping mortgage scams has led to suspicion that he is somehow involved in MyBitcoin, despite claiming to be one of the biggest victims.<br /><br />Angry posters on the bitcoin forums Wagner frequents have begun to spread even worse rumors about Wagner&#039;s past.<br /><br />The viability of the currency itself remains in question as it has never matched the all time highs achieved during the bitcoin media blitz. The exchanges such as Mt.Gox which handle converting bitcoins into real money have faced repeated security challenges which have left the bitcoin market in chaos.<br /><br />Criminal uses for the anonymous currency may save it, but for now it has lost one of its best spokesmen.<br /><br />(via Reddit and SomethingAwful)<br />posted by furiousxgeorge (448 comments total) 17 users marked this as a favorite
