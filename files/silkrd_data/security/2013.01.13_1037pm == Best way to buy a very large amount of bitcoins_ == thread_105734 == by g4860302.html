				I&#039;m wanting to make a big purchase on SR, like $6,000. I&#039;m experienced with buying on SR and buying bitcoins. How I usually get bitcoins is through wm-center.com, using Moneygram or Western Union with a fake name for payment. But I&#039;m a little scared to do that with that much money at one time. I know they would ask for ID, but I have a fake ID with a fake name on it for stuff like this. What other ways would be safe when buying that much bitcoin?

				I recommend finding an actual bitcoin miner through local-bitcoins.com and doing the transaction in cash.<br /><br />There are more standard ways.

				3 words: Blue Sky Traders<br /><br />You go to bank of america and deposit the money, you show no ID. All you have to do is fill out and out-of-state deposit slip and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />Get your coins in about an hour

				what if there isn&#039;t a bank of america within 100 miles? are there any vendors that use a different bank, hopefully one like wells fargo or something? <br /><br />i&#039;m experiencing same difficulty, wal-mart moneygram limits to 500 per transaction, 1k in a day. i need more than that, my usual guy had a limit of 2k because it was a personal bank account, but thats not an option anymore, not on my part. <br />

				What about bitinstanst?&nbsp; You&#039;re limited to $2,000 per day, and $1,000 per bank deposit.&nbsp; But couldn&#039;t you do 2 separate bank deposits for $1,000.&nbsp; It would take 3 days if all went as planned.

				well my last guy would let me deposit cash straight into his bank account and i&#039;d come home and tell him my address and amount deposited and i&#039;d have my coins within the hour. Cant do it anymore cuz its a personal account not a business account. Trying to avoid the 4% fee two separate times. 8% on 2000 is rough&nbsp; :&#039;(

				walmart never asks for ID on moneygram.. but still 500 max transaction which means driving to 4 different locations, often separated pretty far apart where i&#039;m at, and paying close to 100$ in fees on 2k. when you can go to one place one tranaction one fee

				Your best bet to stay under the radar is to do this in multiple small transactions across several exchangers. It&#039;s not a question of BitInstant vs Blue Sky Traders vs whatever. Use all of them.

				Blue Sky Traders has a fee, but they don&#039;t call it a fee.&nbsp; The amount of the fee depends on the amount of coins you buy.

				What about using mtgox or any other big exchange legitimately and sending them to blockchain mixer? You&#039;ll buy at market price and pay only 1.5% to use the mixer. For transactions below ten grant seems okay. Just ask some &quot;clean&quot; friend to open it.

				The address for Blue Sky Traders is - http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion.to/index.htm<br /><br />So far I really like BST, they said they can handle that big of a transaction and they seem reliable. I also was interested in BTCmaster. I have heard of him before from a couple places but don&#039;t know much about him. I&#039;ll have to research more.<br /><br />I also like the idea of using several different traders. a few $2,000 deposits will at least look better than one $6,000 deposit, I would think.

				Bitcopia.com charges 5%??<br /><br />wtf wouldnt it be better to just use bitinstant?<br /><br />the charge 3.99%<br /><br />i always use bitinstant cuz i know its safe and i know how to do it right.. i simply use two different bitcoin address&#039;s AND then i make to seperate bitinstant<br />request for 500 each..<br /><br />then do them at one location then move on to walmart or cvs and do the same untill i have all the money.. it sucks with the fees.. but fuck its better then getting robbed
