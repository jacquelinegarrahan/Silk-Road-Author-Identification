				Hello,<br /><br />I will soon be purchasing a large amount ($18-20k) worth of BTC via a very trusted vendor on Localbitcoins in the USA<br /><br />I&#039;m situated in Eastern US, and have arrange the meet/amount/rate etc so this is all sorted.<br /><br />Now comes the hard part, let&#039;s assume the meet and transaction all goes well (please keep in mind the amount will be used on here in full for illegal item/s).<br /><br />1) Where is the best place to transfer such a large amount to, BTC wallet wise? Shall I send it to my LBC or a blockchain wallet?<br />2) Obviously my final destination shall be my SR wallet, is it safe to transfer this large amount direct from blockchain/LBC direct to SR?<br /><br />I can&#039;t really afford the dollar, but mostly the time to wash the coins. Would this be a safe transaction considering that SR has a built in coin mixer and would this mean the transaction was untraceable technically?<br /><br />P.S. The meetup will be completely anonymous, i&#039;m actually sending a trusted friend on my behalf and no names or any personal info will be exchanged.<br /><br />What are your guys thoughts?<br /><br />milly :)

				I think that&#039;s a hell of a transaction to make. I assume you&#039;ll be giving him cash first and then he&#039;ll send coins to a address that you specify?

				Hello,<br /><br />Yes cash meetup and BTC to an address of my choice.<br /><br />So you think Localbitcoins &gt; Blockchain wallet (not mix the coins) &gt; SR wallet is the safest untraceable route gribble?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Break up the deposit into smaller random sized amounts and request a new address for each deposit.

				I would definitely mix those coins.<br /><br />Go from the localbitcoin wallet to a blockchain wallet then use the blockchain mixer to send to your SR wallet.<br /><br />Blockchain only takes 1.5% which is not too bad for the service they provide. But you only have to mix it if you want to totally be safe.

Also the likelihood is if you need that amount once you&#039;ll need to repeat the process which is where the initial planning is absolutely key.

My main concern is that it&#039;s a scam. I know the guy has a good reputation on some network, but anyone can pull a Tony76. <br /><br />OP, do you know this guy&#039;s identity? Do you have a way of tracking him down? Or perhaps he&#039;ll be using a disposable intermediary, too.

				Hi Guys,<br /><br /><br />Right, let me first start off by saying the issue here isn&#039;t how I acquire the bitcoins (I am almost 100% confident this will go perfect, for reasons I cannot disclose at this time). The issue here is how I clean these coins with the least amount of risk, charge and my time.<br /><br />@Limetless: Do you mind expanding on this, either via PM or on here if you feel comfortable? As you have already hinted, this WILL be a regular occurance with amounts this large so I could really do with nailing it on the head.<br />@astor: The scam idea can be chucked, as I mention above that is the very least of my worries in this situation so please disregard this as an issue.<br /><br />Thanks<br />minky

				I think you guys are totally overthinking it.<br /><br />If you are 100% absolutely no-doubt really very fucking sure that your purchase transaction is anonymous - eg. there&#039;s no way to trace back to you in real life - then just let them send the full amount directly to SR.<br /><br />The reason people mix and use multiple wallets etc is to remove the paper trail from your real life identity eg. if you went and bought bitcoins with a bank deposit, or via MtGox etc.<br /><br />But if it&#039;s 100% cash and anonymous, there is no paper trail. So why worry. If it ever gets tracked back it&#039;ll be to the other guy.<br /><br />So just go generate a new SR address... use it... then generate a new one again so you only used it once. (you should do this in anycase with every deposit).<br /><br />And yeah, Limetless - I know there are better ways to launder, especially cashing *OUT*... but cashing *IN* like this anonymously the risks are very very low. As long as the cash you&#039;re using is also not connected to you - eg withdrawing 20K out of your bank account the same day is probably not wise. But I&#039;m suspecting you&#039;re an IRL dealer looking for wholesale deal here on the road - why else would you be buying 20K worth of drugs - so the money probably came to you in cash and outside the banking system.

I cannot for the life of me see how this could be traceable, and that&#039;s not even taking into account the fact that SR has a built in coin mixer.<br /><br />P.S. With regards to cashing *OUT* as you mention, I understand this is a completely different ball game and some planning would need to go into this to be successful but I have and never will need to cash out BTC, just *IN* :)<br /><br />What do ya&#039;ll think?<br /><br />minky

				God damn it some people on here are naive. Yes cashing IN is just as risky as cashing OUT. <br /><br />Look if you want to discuss this properly PM me.

				Ya its definitely not anonymous on localbitcoins.&nbsp; You have to give them your phone number to meet up with them and do the transaction.
