				We all know bitinstant is not doing the cash deposits to coin address at the moment. What about Bitfloor? Anyone use them and can recommend them? From what I read on their site it seems pretty straight forward; make cash deposit at Bank of America and just sit and wait for my coin to arrive then send them to my sr or blockchain wallet. Would you guys recommend&nbsp; sending straight to my SR wallet or should I send to blockchain then to SR? Does anyone know how long Bitfloor&nbsp; takes to get you your coin?<br />Thanks

				They were by fair my favorite place to get btc before they were robbed. As&nbsp; i understand it the security is much improved and there is no deposit limit. I would use them but unfortunately they stopped chase deposits and there isn&#039;t a bank of america anywhere near me. how long? They were as fast it goes. Bank deposits are always near instantaneous.

				Yo MC do it bro, that shit was easy. About as easy if not easier than bitinstant. All I had to do was go to Bank of America, fill out a deposit slip with the info Bitfloor provides you and take it to the teller, hand over the cash and within 10 min my $ showed up on Bitfloor. Then buy the bitcoin through Bitfloor site and the coin shows up almost instant. <br /><br />That&#039;s where Im at now, Im getting ready right now to transfer to my SR wallet.<br /><br />Good luck my friend, but like I said its a piece of cake.

				@wpwl<br /><br />Do you have any Chase banks around you?&nbsp; If so here is what you do. go to ziggap.com and select cash deposit and enter your info and BTC address to send to.&nbsp; You will get a form with your order number, chase bank account holders name and account number.&nbsp; Go to the drive through at chase bank and ask for a deposit slip and fill in all the info. Make sure you deposit the EXACT amount on the form from ziggap and your done.<br /><br />Now once you do that you should get your coins within an hour or so but after an hour my coins didn&#039;t show and my status said &quot;waiting for bank deposit confirmation&quot;.&nbsp; So I emailed support and got a response in less than 5 mins stating there has been a slight delay. 10 mins after that my status showed completed and checking the block chain I saw my transfer getting confirmations and then I had my coins.<br /><br />I like ziggap more than bitinstant now because of the bank deposit going through the drive through with no ID or personal info, and since I don&#039;t have any BofA&#039;s around here , ziggap was a godsend.<br /><br />I&#039;m still upset with bitinstant and it seems their situation is getting worse than better and with almost no communication for days.&nbsp; Leave bitinstant up eventhough it doesn&#039;t work?? Seems pretty lazy/shady to me.<br /><br />Hope that helps

				No he meant ziggap.com. Just go to that site and it&#039;s all self explanatory. I just used bitfloor today for the first time. Very silky experience so far. Just waiting for them to hit my SR wallet which as everyone knows is the longest part. I love how the USD just shows up in your bitfloor acct without having to call them like you did with bitinstant. Very cool. Damn these forums rock! Or I&#039;d be sending a moneygram under my own name. Thanks a lot guys!!

				Chase is short for Chase Manhattan Bank. It&#039;s one of the big 6 mega banks that actually owns your ass. It&#039;s another Rockefeller creation if I&#039;m not mistaken. Just startpage it and you&#039;ll see locations all over like BoA. Bad part is that ziggap.com has suspended chase deposits for some reason. It says temporarily but who knows. You can send cash in the mail to cryptocurrent. From what I understand they&#039;ll even send you an overnight shipping label.

				Yeah, at my BoA they don&#039;t have the out of state deposit slips at the little kiosk in front of the tellers, just normal deposit slips. You just have to go up to a teller, ask for an out of state deposit slip, fill it out (or just read her the account number and she&#039;ll fill it out for you) make sure the amount is correct, give her cash, done. Couldn&#039;t be easier. I&#039;m pretty sure you can do it in the drive-thru as well.

				Remember, going through the drive-thru is the best route - no cameras.&nbsp; Someone had made a comment that the drive-thus is for customer (account holders) only - they don&#039;t know if you are depositing in your own account or not - what they are preventing is someone who is a non-account holder who has a BofA check that they want to cash (they bring them inside to &#039;check their ID&#039; and to also try to sell them an account) - for all they know you are depositing money into your own account (you&#039;re just from out of town).&nbsp; <br /><br />SOURCE - worked in retail banking for close to a decade...

				Most banks will ask you to remove your hat and sunglasses before you are allowed to do any transactions at the window. There are DEFINITELY CCTV cameras at the drive thru&#039;s taking pictures of every driver and passenger. How about this- go in the bank with your shoulders back and your head up like you aren&#039;t doing anything wrong- BECAUSE YOU AREN&#039;T!!! It is not illegal to buy BTC and I would hazard a guess that many of the people who buy them are not doing so for illicit reasons. It&#039;s great to be safe, but the paranoia is getting out of hand. Does anyone know of anyone that has EVER been pinched because of messing with SR? Anyone??? I&#039;d love to hear how it happened if they exist, but my guess is it wasn&#039;t because they bought some coins anonymously at the bank! Relax and enjoy SR because it is fully awesome and we shouldn&#039;t be biting our nails. We should be having fun and helping others to do so. Enjoy!!!

				Tried out BitFloor today and everything went through smoothly. The money was in my account by the time I drove back home so it posts pretty fast. The fees are way less with BitFloor than Bitinstant, about $6 cheaper on a $80 deposit. The transfer times are pretty good, took about 3 hours from cash deposit to coins in my SR account.<br /><br />I was already annoyed that bitinstant did away with bank deposits, but once I heard Mt.gox was verifying identification it was time to jump off that sinking ship. I prefer bank deposits and they don&#039;t give a shit if you wear a hat and glasses inside the bank, at least not around here.

				Bitfloor sounds great, but there is only 2 BoA locations anywhere near me - and they are both ATM only locations.&nbsp; One specifically says it does not accept deposits, while the other will accept deposits of cash or checks.&nbsp; Would I be able to use this to do an out of state deposit?&nbsp; I&#039;m kinda assuming its only to deposit into your personal BoA account, as I doubt they&#039;d have the proper forms located at an ATM.&nbsp; Would just go check, but it&#039;s not all that close to me in the first place.&nbsp; Really hoping Bitinstant gets shit together, or Bitfloor gets back on board with Chase.

It seems pretty common outside the USA. You don&#039;t need a bank card to use these machines. You just enter the account number you want the funds deposited into, then insert cash or checks. The machine will show the name of the account holder so you can verify that it&#039;s the right account and it will count your cash or scan your checks. I&#039;ve done this overseas to make hotel reservations. This would seem to be an ideal Bitcoin-buying scenario for vendors like Bitcopia or Bitfloor.

				Whirl I found the whole bitfloor experience doable and fairly efficient I was annoyed at the lack of conis available and the relative low volume of trading. Hopefully that will improve but I found myself paying at least #1.50 higher per btx then Mt. Gox current high. While the fees were much lower at 1% for the deposit handler and the 0.4% for the bitfloor fees. The additional cost per coin made it a wash with bitinstant fees. It is sad to see Bitinstant go the way they are and add to that Mt Gox/ I hate the fees for the traders of btc for mp here not to mention the ease of getting ripped off.<br /><br />Hilly.

It was toooo easy. The lady at the register saw that I was having some difficulty fill in up the slip for the first time (had to ask for the slip and let her know that I may need help as this is my first time doing this) and she insisted to do it for me which of course was my plan from the get-go. I just arrived home and the entire amount was in my account. Traded for the coins and NO! it was INSTANT, no waiting what so ever to get your coins. All I know that bitinstant lost a LOT of customers that used to do money grams like myself. FUCK them idiots who the fuck do they think they can down their site for over a week...fucking morons loosing god knows how much money...I also did not get a chance to party last week due to their crap until I found out about bitfloor last night...bitinstant can go fuck themselves now. Thank you Bitfloor. Party time this weekend :)<br /><br />

				yep, you are right, bitfloor might be plan A, and bitinstant will be plan B!<br />this bitfloor sounds exactly like bitinstant&#039;s system when i could make an out of state deposit at my local bank of america. though i doubt this can last long, bank of america will feel the heat from LE, and stop the bitfloor thing too, like they stopped bitinstant.<br /><br />and my local branch would give me a stack of the out of state deposit slips, so i could fill it out at home, make the deposit quickly when i go in the bank, not call attention to myself.<br /><br />although i didn&#039;t find the CVS system so bad with bitinstant, who is now back up, btw.<br />i think i will use bitfloor and bitinstant both, until bank of america stops taking deposits, or mt. gox starts verifying i.d., like dwolla does.

				Bitfloor was very smoothly for me.&nbsp; Setup my account, setup a deposit at a BOA, walked in grabbed an out of state deposit slip.&nbsp; Teller filled it out for me.&nbsp; Took my cash and deposited it into the account I was given.&nbsp; Also picked up a few extra out of state deposit forms for future deposits.&nbsp; Even though Bitcoins are not illegal to purchase I would like to point out NO ID IS ASKED FOR WHEN MAKING A DEPOSIT!&nbsp; You just give them the deposit slip and the deposit is made, you could also do this from the drive thru with no issues at all if you wanted to.&nbsp; I live 20 minutes away from a BOA and by the time I got home my cash was in my Bitfloor account.&nbsp; The only objection I have to them is their Bitcoin purchasing price, which was almost four dollars more than Mt. Gox per coin.&nbsp; I was only charged $2.86 to transfer $200.00 USD into the Bitfloor account, but they get you in the back end charging inflated Bitcoin prices.&nbsp; So it ended up being around $11.00 USD in fees to transfer $200.00 USD into 4.51 Bitcoins.&nbsp; Bitinstant is fairly cheaper, espically using Mt. Gox.&nbsp; Which comes to around $6.00 USD to transfer $200.00 USD into Bitcoins from start to finish.<br /><br />Hope this helps!.

				Guys be very careful when buying Bitcoins of Bitfloor.<br /><br />When you see the price on Bitfloor, go back and check if its the same on Mtgox.com<br /><br />Because I was about to purchase them for $138.5 on bitfloor.<br />I check on MtGox, and it was at $131.5...<br /><br />That&#039;s like almost a $7 difference in between those websites.<br /><br />I refreshed Bitfloor, it jumped down to $136.5...<br />Refreshed again, it jumped down to $135.5....<br /><br />So in few minutes you can give Bitfloor $10-$20 extra,<br /><br />Bitfloor is slow on updates.<br /><br />Check and Refresh people.
