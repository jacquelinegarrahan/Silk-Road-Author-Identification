				A poster suggested adding a dead man&#039;s switch to the forum as a security measure. What is that?

				You should have asked that poster :p<br /><br />Its a fail safe usually.<br /><br />So for example, if the forum admin doesn&#039;t complete some special command at the end of each day, the forum goes down with a warning, or self deletes or something.<br /><br />It could be so many things in any different context.

Perhaps when activated, an e-mail could be sent to each user&#039;s Tormail address (each user would at this point be required to use a tormail address for SR) informing him/her that the SR forum has been compromised.

				Can you link to the original thread...<br /><br />I don&#039;t see the context in which it has any use.<br /><br />Security?<br /><br />What can a rogue admin do to the forum in a covert way?<br /><br />There&#039;s no personal info here so what is there to actually lose/gain?

				Another example was the (now defunct) Wikileaks insurance file.<br />Should Julian Assange go missing or Wikileaks not be able to continue operations, the password for the file is released and along with it all unredacted documents.

				Is there any way to install a deadman&#039;s switch without the cooperation by SR?<br /><br />This seems like a very good idea.

A daily cron that runs a script to see if a file was touched, else email, for example.
