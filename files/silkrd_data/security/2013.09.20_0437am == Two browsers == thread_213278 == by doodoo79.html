				I&#039;ve always heard to never have Tor and another browser open at the same time. Can someone explain the affects/dangers of doing this? Thanks!

				The main danger of having Tor and clearnet browsers open at the same time is forgetiing which is which, and logging into your Mt Gox account via Tor, for example. Otherwise its not unsafe

				Yeah, it&#039;s human error. TBB doesn&#039;t leak anything to your clearnet browser on its own. It could be exploited of course, but in that case the attacker would aim for more interesting targets anyway, like we saw in the FH attack. He might grab your MAC address and send that with your IP address to a phone home server.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the SR community is they believe Tor is only for hidden services. and clearnet links should be copied to clearnet browsers. That&#039;s not true! Any link you find on the darknet should be viewed only over Tor.<br />

				But there is this to still worry about as well, right?&nbsp; <br /><br />You don&#039;t want to be on the same server with both browsers at the same time... <br /><br /><br />https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO#Donotconnecttoanyserveranonymouslyandnon-anonymouslyatthesametime<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time!<br /><br />It&#039;s highly recommended that you do not connect to any remote server in this manner. That is, do not create a Tor link and a non-Tor link to the same remote server at the same time. In the event your internet connection breaks down (and it will eventually), all your connections will break at the same time and it won&#039;t be hard for an adversary to put the pieces together and determine what public IP belongs to what Tor IP, potentially identifying you directly. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

That&#039;s not the biggest problem with the SR community, although it is a problem. The biggest problem is people blindly FEing for blatant scammers without reading the pages of feedback that would tip them off not to FE.<br />
