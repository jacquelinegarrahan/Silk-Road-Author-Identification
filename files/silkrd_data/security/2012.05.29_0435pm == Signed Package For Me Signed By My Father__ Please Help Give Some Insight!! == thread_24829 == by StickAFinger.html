				So last week I had a hell of a Tuesday delivery. It was Christmas basically<br /><br />4 packages, arrived all at once:<br />50g of molly- NL Vendor<br />10 THC pills- US Domestic<br />Darknet bootable usb stick- US Domestic<br />10 Xanax Bars - US Domestic<br /><br /><br />Now, I was taking a shower when the packages arrived. My father who was over watching a soccer game answered the door for me and apparently had to sign for one of the packages??<br /><br />He didnt care, left all the shit unopened on my counter as i casually asked him what he had to sign for? which he didnt know.<br /><br />now this was last week, I never signed for anything on here before.<br /><br />Is this bad news? is this normal? Does it depend on type of delivery priority?&nbsp; Does my balls make my penis look small?<br /><br />can you guys give some insight? It will be MUCH APPRECIATED<br /><br />best,<br /><br />Beasty

				I&#039;d be more suspicious of the USB stick&nbsp; stealing my login info and sending it to the maker. <br /><br />Sometimes overseas vendors will want signature confirmation to protect themselves from scammers, since DCN doesn&#039;t work internationally. I can understand this, and have agreed to it in the past. He should have let you know this though. Ask the vendors you bought stuff from, easy as that.<br /><br />

				Well, even though this vendor (uglysurfer) has had great reviews and was insanely helpful and gave me loads of pdf&#039;s and programs anonymizing me...i went ahead and reformatted my computer, installed a new OS and changed all my passwords. no big deal anyways but, that freaked me out. i mean i already had successful transactions and plenty of bitcoins that he could have taken and what not?<br /><br />but whatever. i guess that dude who first responded was right..i am dumb&nbsp; :-\

				Nah you aren&#039;t dumb, paranoia makes us do weird things. Dumb would be not attempting to take any precautions at all. I suggest taking one of those THC pills and rewarding yourself to a chilled out day, I hear xanax + MJ are one hell of combo ;)

				Yeah man, don&#039;t worry too much. Sorry for freaking you out. The USB stick is probably fine, and it&#039;s a good method to be using. I was just pointing out that it would be rather easy to set one up for that purpose, and while installing a secure Linux OS to a USB stick can be rather involved, it&#039;s not all that difficult, and you&#039;ll learn alot in the process.<br />

				good people all around. I messaged the guy and im gonna be honest he&nbsp; a good guy. I mean for god sakes i have over $3000 bitc transaction with multiple triple digit gram transactions with that, ive been travelling with it and everything. He was upset and really wanted to fan this out as he knows tracers and programs that can do this and explicitly told me its not. Im relaxed now, and im sticking with my gut on this.<br /><br />Uglysurfer is a good man. i reformatted my fucking computer but whatever. the xanny bar made me enjoy the whole process haha<br /><br />thanks again though every one.
