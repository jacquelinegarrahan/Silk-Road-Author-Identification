				I have onion on my iPhone. You can also use<br />&nbsp;GPG if your phone is jail broke. You need mobile terminal as its command line only. I <br />wrote a brief tutorial on it: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27442.msg299005#msg299005<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However many people expressed security concerns about using Tor on cellphones. Not sure what difference this would be from using a 3G dongle? I&#039;m not disputing, as I don&#039;t know enough but I would like more information on what the extra risks might be. I always switch GPS off. Are the risks to do with the connection through cellphone network ie some kind of risk of narrowing down location.<br />Or are the risks more to do with potential&nbsp; seizure of phone and evidence left on it? I always wipe the GPG files ie key rings and .conf files between uses. The GPG software remains on phone but with no keys until I need them.

				Yes javascript is required. A note on copying the browser link, why not just memorize it? I think it&#039;s great that my android can log in faster than my computer that is a proxy whore. I&#039;ve only gone on SR through my phone through an account made just for my phone. Probably security paranoia but it&#039;s what I do and it&#039;s only to browse the listings and sometimes catch up on forum glib.

				Thanks guys enabling JS worked perfectly, I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t think of it first, I&#039;ve just never user orweb before. As for the safety of TOR on android or iphone, I say its just as safe if not safer to connect via mobile phone. Just take the standard precautions to disable geolocation and only use a secure and locked down browser to navigate SR. Remember all in all TOR is quite secure, its what gets sent over TOR such as your messages as well as your browsers&#039; messages that can compromise your identity. I personally think its pretty sweet that we now have the ability to use TOR on our smartphones now, I swear the power of anonymity is constantly growing and the possibilities that will arise from this will return our freedoms as they were originally intended.

				answered my own question haha :<br />&quot;Transparent Proxying: You must root your device in order for Orbot to work transparently for all web and DNS traffic. If you root your device, whether it is 1.x or 2.x based, Orbot will automatically, transparently proxy all web traffic on port 80 and 443 and all DNS requests. This includes the built-in Browser, Gmail, YouTube, Maps and any other application that uses standard web traffic.&quot;<br /><br /><br />TWM<br />

				I don&#039;t actually think JavaScript is required, I think that is actually a security risk and could expose your real IP address if you visited a malicious web page. I think all you have to do to be able to login is change the browser identifier setting to Firefox in OrWeb.

				p0w3r2th3p30ple - all depends on how much security you really need or how paranoid you are.<br /><br />Are you just buying small amounts of personal use drugs? Some people wouldn&#039;t care as much then. Phone&#039;s are usually less secure then some personal computers because of out of date security &amp; software (just one reason). Phone&#039;s are becoming more &amp; more of a target for hackers these days.<br /><br />
