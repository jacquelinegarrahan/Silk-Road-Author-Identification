				I&#039;m sure this has been discussed but I can&#039;t seem to find it. Can anyone instruct me on how I get Tor on my iPad 2 or point me in the direction so I can figure out how to do it? I would really appreciate it!!

				G&#039;day can&#039;t say I&#039;ve heard of one and a quick search of the forum proved fruitless but I reckon it would be a great idea for a developer to jump on it if it hasn&#039;t already been done. <br />Also an Android app would be great if anyone knows of one/can be bothered making one.

				There is an iPad app called Covert Browser.&nbsp; It can handle Tor.&nbsp; You can check the forums and tormail.org, but I have been unsuccessful logging into SR.<br /><br />I did a search and found others complaining that Covert Browser cannot connect to SR.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s a hidden service thing?

				You raise a good point about the lack of security when using mobile devices to browse Tor. I hadn&#039;t thought about that one
