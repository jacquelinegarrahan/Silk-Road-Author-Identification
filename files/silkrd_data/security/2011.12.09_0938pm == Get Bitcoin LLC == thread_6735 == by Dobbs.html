				I&#039;ve been using Get Bitcoin since I started on SR.&nbsp; First few times was the cash deposit to BOA.&nbsp; That was fine, got my bitcoin in 24 hours.&nbsp; But then it started to take longer, and I had to send an email to remind them.&nbsp; As soon as they replied to the email I got my bitcoin.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m using a different method, and I ordered the bitcoin Sunday and still dont have them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wanted to give a heads up that in my experience the cash deposit is the best way.

				Yea, for a direct bank transfer I would agree campBX would be better and cheaper.

				It seems that as the price of bitcoin goes up the time it takes to get them gets longer...when the price is dropping I get them fast.

				i used get-bitcoin.com for the first time yesterday after reading everyones reviews on it.&nbsp; Once I emailed the copy of my receipt to them they replied quickly saying the order was being processed, and since then (26 hours ago) I have not heard anything and have also sent two emails to them with no return.&nbsp; It feels sketchy to me, the person I used to use would confirm bank deposit and send coins over with in 2 hours. Has anyone had an order take a long time with no communication with them?

				used them last night and had coins in my wallet and an email confirmation when I woke up this morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;If they take longer than 24 hours it&#039;s supposed to be free but they&#039;ve never taken that long for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				So I&#039;m planning on starting the whole order process for the first time tomorrow (hi everyone, btw). So nobody has had any trouble with the cash deposit method? That seems to be the best way to get btc if you live near BoA/Chase. And has anyone encountered suspicion at the bank? I only ask because I&#039;ve had my balls busted before for making cash deposits into other peoples accounts, and other similar shit like pharmacies calling the cops because you pay in cash.

				I&#039;ve used BTC for 4-5 transactions now, always using a cash deposit (which seems like a great anonymous way to buy btc imho). Usually takes 8-24 hours for them to deposit the coins, but if you&#039;re getting antsy, just email them. This seems to speed up the process some from what I&#039;ve found.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also used both Chase and BoA. Only issue I have experienced was once at a BoA when the teller asked me what state get-bitcoin was in. I said I didn&#039;t know, but thought it was Connecticut (which is usually a good guess in the USA due to CT tax laws). The teller just looked up the info at this incident and didn&#039;t say anything else. Overall I&#039;ve found get-bitcoin very easy to use. Usually from the time of deposit to actual purchase on SR takes 24-36 hours depending on a variety of factors, which I find acceptable. I wish the process was quicker, as I have lost some coin during this time due to market fluctuations, but I figure that is just part of the issue in dealing with BTCs.

				I used them on Tuesday. Cash deposit at BoA. Got my bitcoins 18 hours later. Did you send them a copy of the bank receipt?<br /><br />The teller asked for my bank card, but I said I wasn&#039;t a customer and that was the end of it.
