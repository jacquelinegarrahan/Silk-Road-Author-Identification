				Hey all,<br /><br />Since it is now becoming quite apparent that BitInstant has scammed thousands of us, some of us have decided to go out &quot;clubbing&quot; saturday night!!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Head on down to EVR in New York City, 54 W 39th St (between Avenue Of The Americas &amp; 5th Ave) and bring your billyclubs &amp; tasers to handle security (but no guns, please), and pillowcases to hold your loot.&nbsp; Charlie Shrem, CEO of BitInstant has stolen our money to open up a swanky midtown bar and we&#039;re going to collect our debts on Saturday.<br /><br />I can confirm that there is plenty of top shelf liquor, nice furniture, and expensive tablets &amp; computer systems that we can either loot or destroy.&nbsp; its all up to you.&nbsp; Even if you show up late, you can at least take a shit on their kitchen floor.<br /><br />If you are owed money by Charlie Shrem, this is your chance to collect!!!!!<br /><br />Hope a lot of you can make it!&nbsp; Even if NYC is a couple hours drive for you, you should really come.&nbsp; this is gonna be a night to remember!!<br />&nbsp;8)

				Aff... is all I can say about it. Sorry to those who did lose cash. But, now that the address of his new establishment has been released, who knows what and when something could happen. On the other hand, I am sure he has it insured well enough to where destroying the building would only make him more money... I think? If I was to ever stoop as low as to steal for my earnings, I sure as HELL wouldn&#039;t be stealing from a group of people who actually had to be told not to advertise &quot;hits&quot; . Talk about a massive case of paranoia.

				Jesus christ.. there not robbing anyone dude.. pretend YOU ran than business now, and bitcoins were going up and down DRASTICALLY in hours... your business would get fucked up as well...<br /><br />if u did a transfer and it didnt get through, dont sit and do nothing... hit up their live help, email them, go to bitcointalk and create a account, takes 5 seconds, and create a forum and hit up there rep he WILL answer you within the day and most likely fix your problem, im sure youve lost a fair amount of money....<br /><br />Even i did through bitcopia, it took about 4 hours and i went from 950$ to 750$ but thats the game u play when u wana buy in uncertain times..<br /><br />hopet his helps
