For instance who knows if tormail is a honeypot or not, in order to be secure you should be using pgp encrypted messages when your using tomail. That way there is no way &quot;they&quot; know who is using the account, yes &quot;they&quot; may have the email address you are communicating with but that is it.<br /><br />And as for th other party you are writing to, all depends on how secure they are. Did they signup for there email account anonymously? are they using pgp?

(obviously)....<br />i know that pgp coul be a (pretty good) solution but people are quite lazy about using it...<br /><br />mhm.. if tor mail is a honeypot (or they force it in some way)&nbsp; can they know our real IP&#039;s? or just check our communications?? i know that tor mail isn&#039;t strictly connected with tor project.. so we can&#039;t trust on it as on tor?<br /><br />&nbsp; :-*<br />

You can send or receive email from within Tormail to/from other Tormail users, and you can also do the same to normal clearnet email addresses.<br /><br />-- Some general Tormail advice --<br /><br />However, there is an issue like has already been mentioned. You shouldn&#039;t trust the Tormail operators as a matter of principal. Could be they are nice guys, but who really can know.<br /><br />You should use PGP when possible, and also sometimes you should setup Tormail accounts for a single use (to prevent network analysis).<br /><br />Use the non javascript version of Tormail, turn off Javascript and use Squirrel Mail version.<br /><br />To switch between Tormail accounts, you should logout, switch your Tor identity and clear the Tormail cookie from your browser. Then wait a few minutes before logging in. This prevents association of Tormail account ownership, or at the least it prevents it being used as circumstantial evidence in a court of law.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Thought:<br /><br />It would be nice if an anonymous remailer system existed that wasn&#039;t dependent on a 3rd party. e.g. obfuscating who you are sending email to, so Tormail couldn&#039;t possibly do network analysis. You can do this on clearnet but it&#039;s a bit of a pain, especially since it&#039;s not your email you&#039;re trying to obfuscate. Any clever solutions out there? Edit: I just remembered there is one that Guru mentioned, but I mean something much simpler to setup as a single use situation, ideally one click setup.<br /><br />

				What&#039;s that joke about tormail? If you want to stay safe it&#039;s fine for westerner&#039;s drugs and guns but don&#039;t mention anything subversive about Russian politics?
