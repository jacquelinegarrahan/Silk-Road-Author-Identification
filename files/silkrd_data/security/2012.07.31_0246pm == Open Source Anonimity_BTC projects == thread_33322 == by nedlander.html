				There was a previous thread about an Open Source SR. I&#039;m not sure whether the OP wanted to open source SR or to create a new system based on SR functionality. Regardless there was very little support and a lot of valid points on why it was a bad idea or at least very difficult to pull off.<br /><br />This thread isn&#039;t about anything nearly as ambitious as that. What I&#039;d like to see is some small scale open source projects focused around either anonymity or BTC in general. A few ideas:<br /><br />* Online wallet framework (perhaps like instawallet)<br />* Basic general-purpose single-vendor shopping cart focused on anonymous purchasing.<br />* BTC Exchange/Escrow/Hedging frameworks<br />* Basically any tools/example frameworks that would help people establish anonymous/btc versions of&nbsp; existing clearweb services.<br /><br />Ideally they could be built openly on the clearweb, with mission statements focusing on the ideals of anonymity and our rights to privacy. <br /><br />There are multiple goals to this starting with sharing knowledge, establishing best practice, improving securty etc. On a grander scale I&#039;d like to imagine it expanding the anon/btc economy and adding a degree of legitimacy to the whole thing. BTC and Tor, IMHO, should be about much more than drugs, guns and CP. <br /><br />Are there any other like minded people out there?

I&#039;ll start with what I&#039;ve been given:<br /><br />Open-Transactions<br />Link: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions<br />Description: A financial crypto and digital cash software library. The software&#039;s author likens it to &quot;PGP for money&quot;. Open Transactions (a centralized transaction system) is complementary to Bitcoin in that it provides some features that Bitcoin cannot, such as untraceable anonymous (versus pseudonymous) transactions, no latency (instant finality of settlement / no risk of double spending) and more. <br /><br />Moneychanger<br />Link: https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Moneychanger<br />Description: A reference implementation (experimental only at present) of a currency accounting application that accesses the Open Transactions API<br />
