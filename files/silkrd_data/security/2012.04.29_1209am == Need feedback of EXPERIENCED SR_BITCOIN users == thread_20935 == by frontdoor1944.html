				I&#039;m fairly new but have been researching everything to death before I buy bitcoins and order.&nbsp; I&#039;m going on the faith of others here, their knowledge, experiences and overall &quot;been there - done that&quot; mentality.&nbsp; I apologize beforehand for the lengthy post!&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the idea of going anywhere and getting a money order if someone is going to ask for my information. I&#039;d like to remain as anonymous as possible.<br /><br />I did a bit of research on the possibility of going in somewhere to get the bitcoins. A &quot;bitcoin exchange&quot;, if you will.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found a site called &quot;betabeat.com&quot; and it broke it down pretty well. <br />&nbsp;They headline the article: &quot;Deposit cash at Bank of america and get bitcoin, thanks to BitInstant and TrustCash.&quot;<br /><br />I downloaded a deposit slip from TrustCash (you can print this out, which would seem the better way to go but my printer is out of commission). You then locate the nearest Bank of america or Chase bank (exact address), fill out a deposit/invoice slip with the amount (exact amt which includes a service charge) and submit to which ever bank you choose. I had my information sent via SMS (not sure if that was the smartest thing to do but wanted all account numbers/invoice #&#039;s handy) When you receive the invoice/deposit slip I have exactly 2 business days to go&nbsp; bank of choice and actually give them the money and invoice.<br /><br />Article said go to bank with exact cash along with deposit slip (invoice) and say, &quot;I am making a deposit into the account detailed on this invoice&quot;. No need for id or explanation.&nbsp; Once the money and invoice are submitted to bank, TrustCash sees when that exact amount is deposited and credits the customer (me) with the bitcoins. TrustCash alerts BitInstant of balances on 30-minute intervals. BitInstant then credits the BTC to the customer&#039;s account (minus transaction fee of course).<br /><br />*NOW I&#039;M STUCK....I received an account # from TrustCash (TCASH ADS, Inc.). I&#039;m going to make the deposit Monday morning when they open.&nbsp; <br />-where/which website do I go to to locate my BTC (amt deposited)?<br />-do I go to BitInstant? will they have my information?<br />-do I go to BitInstant and enter my account number assigned by TrustCash?<br /><br />then....<br />-how do I transfer bitcoins to merchant after ordering? with my account #given by TrustCash? or will BitInstant have my account #on file?<br /><br />then...<br />when I place order with vendor on SR, will they ask for my BitInstant account number? after ordering, will merchant give me some type of tracking number? If so, can that tracking number be traced back to my name in any way?&nbsp; I know I have to give them my name and address as I want it on package.&nbsp; If package gets sent to my home, will a tracking number confirm transaction between vendor and me?&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to avoid this and of course I would never sign for a package.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m asking if I&#039;m taking the correct first steps and if there are any additional steps I should take to remain anonymous could an experienced SR member please let me know what they could be? any suggestions?&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;ve read enough posts here to know initial steps. I need to know what site I will need to go to in order to gain access to Bitcoins and if my account number will remain the same if I decide to transfer more money through Bank of America or will I need to go through the whole process of obtaining another invoice?<br />Thank you so much!!!!!<br />I&#039;m getting antsy and can&#039;t wait to place my first order!!!! :)

				I&#039;m not going to lie, I didn&#039;t read your whole post. However if you are looking to get bitcoins quickly and easily you can follow these steps.<br />1. Sign up for a mtgox account (its a bitcoin exchange)<br />2. Go to bitinstant.com and enter 1) your mtgox username or account number 2) amount you want to deposit and 3) email address<br />3. It will then let you choose which bank close to you you want to make the deposit at (Mine are always BOA)<br />4. It will create an invoice for you that contains all of the info you need for the deposit (exact amount to deposit/acct #/state/ect)<br />5. Go to BOA or whatever bank you chose and get a deposit slip (it&#039;s always out of state for me) and fill it out using the information from the invoice. Give this to the teller along with the EXACT amount the invoice tells you to depsoit.<br />6. After your deposit, you can call the number it gives you on the invoice and confirm your deposit. After this, your funds will almost immediately be in your mt.gox account.<br />7. You can then convert your funds into bitcoins and transfer them to SR.<br /><br />Hope this is what you are asking for.

				I&#039;ve had good results with https://www.bitinstant.com/ , which came through quickly and without any hitches. It works in conjunction with http://www.coinapult.com/.&nbsp; It&#039;s a simple two-step process: you purchase the BTC&#039;s through bitinstant, and coinapult takes the cash that bitinstant converts to BTC&#039;s and sends them to whatever wallet you designate (e.g. your Silk Road Wallet). Not sure why bitinstant doesn&#039;t offer the second part of the service, but again, it worked out smoothly and quickly.

				After a successful deposit, you will be given the info you need from bitinstant.&nbsp; Then just use your SR-wallet-generated address to tell coinapult where to send the BTC&#039;s.

				Followup to my previous post:<br /><br />If you want to use my suggestion about bitinstant/coinapult, just remember that on bitinstant you will need to choose Pay From &quot;Cash Bank Deposit&quot; and Pay To &quot;Bitcoin to email&quot; (coinapult).

				One last thing: after you make your deposit, you will receive three emails.&nbsp; One from trustcash, one from bitinstant, one from coinapult.&nbsp; The one from bitinstant will contain a link to coinapult to do the final step of the the BTC-to-wallet transfer, but DO NOT use that link.&nbsp; Wait for the email from coinapult, and use the link that will be in it.&nbsp; This link from coinapult will include everything you need from the bitinstant deposit -- all you will need to do is fill in your SR Wallet-generated address.<br /><br />It&#039;s not as confusing as I may be making it sound, and has worked well for me so far.<br /><br />Again, if anyone knows of any security risks in my bitinstant/coinapult way of transferring BTC&#039;s please let me know!&nbsp; Of course nothing is 100% safe, but again, so far no problems.

				skip mtgox and go straight for the coinapult email delivery option. then you just go to coinapult site and claim coins, transfer them to whatever address you want (here). as long as it&#039;s small and you are a casual personal amounts buyer who gives a fuck nobody will know.

				yes, i also use this method. The bank i deposit into is chase bank. They have an express business deposit line(no i.d required) just give them a deposit slip and make sure your prints aren&#039;t on it. email confirmation within minutes to half an hour. SR members suggest coinapult to bitcoinfog then SR but i think its safe to go straight to SR. From what i have heard Sr also washes bitcoins upon entering the bitcoin site address. The downfall with Bitinstant is the fee, if you use bitcoinfog there&#039;s another fee as well. Please correct me if i am wrong.

				So if BitInstant has record of my deposit, I can give them my SR account I want bitcoins deposited to without going through Coinapult? <br />Is coinapult necessary or just one more security step?

				I&#039;ve been emailing charlie from BitInstant, <br />When I printed out original deposit slip I did not have my acct, number SR gave me, It seems an account number was generated? <br />Can I just give BitInstant my SR account number and have it directly deposited?

				&nbsp;Coinapult is how you retrieve the bitcoins in the email want it sent to.&nbsp; On the bitinstant website, choose the bank cash deposit and bitcoin to email method. In the deposit slip you will need to put trust cash holdings account information and the total deposit including fees. after that, check the email you chose and click on the link to retrieve the bitcoins. this link will send you to coinapults secure website... you do not need a coinapult account to retrieve the bitcoins. This link sends you to the coinapult website, After that you have an option to send the bitcoins to any bitcoin address. As long as you have the address the bitcoins can be sent anywhere including SR or any wallets/fogs. I hope this helps

				Thanks ganjabread. I&#039;m a doofus. I basically made a deposit into a &quot;demo link&quot;. Thats what Bitinstant told me so I must have did everything backwards.

				frontdoor, re-read my post about the three emails you will receive.&nbsp; And no, coinapult isn&#039;t just about security, it&#039;s a necessary step.<br /><br />It&#039;s basically using bitinstant to generate a deposit slip that will enable you to deposit cash into TrustCash (using a major bank), then coinapult to send the resulting bitcoins to whatever wallet you designate.&nbsp; If you use the link in that third email I previously referenced (the one from coinapult), your trustcash/bitinstant info (including amt) will be all filled in ... you simply supply a wallet address such as SR.
