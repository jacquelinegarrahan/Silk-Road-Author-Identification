				I&#039;ve been thinking about how would it be selling at SR and I was wondering how sellers do withdraw money without being noticed.<br /><br />So if I were a vendor and switched my BCs to $/€ and transfer it into my bank account depending on how much money it was it would get locked. right?<br /><br />So I&#039;d like to know how do/would you get your money from BC&#039;s.<br /><br />My thoughts were either you change bitcoins for cash (yet undeclared money), or claim it to be gains from speculation in Bitcoin market.<br /><br />Go ahead, enlighten me.

				It&#039;s not really this topic. It&#039;s any topic that talks about the mechanics of how shit works.<br /><br />This is a public forum. Anyone can read it. Including people who have no business knowing it.<br /><br />Nothing is gleaned from anonymous forum posts about selling or buying contraband...but if we talk methodology we expose weakness.

				I agree that this is one of the few things that shouldn&#039;t be discussed in any kind of detail on here.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same etiquette as not divulging the practical methods of a seller&#039;s shipping (anyone who does should have their thread deleted immediately by a mod - this is information that actually CAN be used against the community).<br /><br />There are two major threats to SR from the outside.&nbsp; Being able to properly trace the flow of money and the names behind it, and being able to identify packages based on profiling, which gives them points of origin and buyer information.&nbsp; Both of these things should not be discussed.<br /><br />Sellers are at largest risk from divulging the money side of things, buyers are at the largest risk from divulging packaging particulars.&nbsp; I can guarantee you that sellers are probably using some of the most clever means of shuffling money around, and are also probably using some of the dumbest, &quot;hey look at me!&quot; methods, too.&nbsp; These aren&#039;t things that should be discussed.&nbsp; There are ample resources elsewhere and with a little critical think and the plethora of virtual exchanges in dozens of digital currencies and brick-and-mortar currencies, anyone can figure out a solid method of changing earnings into cash-in-hand.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t post about it here.

				Without going into details is fine.<br />Many people set up a company that buys and sells perfectly legal things.<br />Then they buy/sell illegal drugs and just write on their books that they were the legal things.<br />Often this is done in a tax haven as nobody wants to pay tax on their drugs, and also there are more detailed checks on your books in places with higher taxes.<br /><br />The clean money and company washes or launders the dirty money.

				I highly doubt anyone here is going to discuss any methods the authorities don&#039;t already know about.<br /><br />You need to be aware of how bank account deposits and withdrawals are monitored in your country. <br />Do they report all transactions? Only transactions over a certain amount? Total transactions in a certain period of time? Can you avoid triggering these reports by dividing them up between accounts at different banks? Which agency gets the reports?<br /><br />If you&#039;re gonna funnel the money through a legit business, what is likely to trigger an audit of your records? What kind of records do you need to keep? Businesses that deal mostly in cash sale transactions are probably the best bet. <br /><br />Cash and pre-paid debit cards are probably the simplest bet, though.

				Obviously, best not discussing details...lets just say it&#039;s one of those things where it pays to think more then 2 steps ahead.<br /><br />Having said that with a little bit of creativity and imagination it&#039;s surprisingly easy.

				Fuck all that.<br /><br />If I had a large sum of money to launder, I&#039;d want to put it in something that is value-dense (money per cubic inch) and also a decent investment.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to beat precious metals for that purpose.<br /><br />Buy old PSA or NGC graded gold coins on eBay. Great investment, easy to transport, and no problem getting your investment back out of it.<br /><br />Anyone have a better solution for something value-dense? I find that the biggest worry.

				granted its alot of work to gather the goods anonymity is key, <br /><br />there are sites where you can buy amazon vouchers, newegg, barnes and noble, with bitcoins maybe buying those and selling/cashing them&nbsp; would work
