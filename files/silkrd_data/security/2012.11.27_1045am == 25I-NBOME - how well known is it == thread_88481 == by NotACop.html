				Is this substance easily detectable in drug tests? Can it be smelled by dogs?<br /><br />Are the risks smaller if you get caught with 25I than with LSD for example?

				Well, I&#039;ve heard NBOMe is fairly new so I&#039;m not 100% sure of the controlled substances law when you get arrested for it.<br />I doubt the court/police will label it as NBOMe though, they will label it as LSD or acid just to fuck with you.<br /><br />I do know it is not 100% safe for you, my friend had to be sent to the emergency room from a tab before.<br /><br />Not sure if it was just him or the tabs, but I felt fine when I did it with him.<br /><br />Lol, dogs being trained to smell a tab of NBOMe that virtually has almost no smell?

				It cannot be tested for at all. If you are caught selling it they will slap identical charges to selling LSD, because they do not care. I highly doubt it can be smelled by dogs as they would have to train them to and it&#039;s not really worth their time... yet. Also, if the smell is anything like acid (no smell), then good luck dogs, come get me!<br /><br />Also, if you get it from a reputable source, there is no reason it shouldn&#039;t be safe IMO.
