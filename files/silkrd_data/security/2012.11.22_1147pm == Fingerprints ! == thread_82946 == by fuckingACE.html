				Helllooo<br />Quick question. <br />Can LE dust for fingerprints on the inside of an envelope? i.e paper.. <br />I guess its not the best medium to get a print off, but is it possible.. Say if LE caught 3 of your packages, dusted inside and out for prints and lo and behold there are one set of prints common to all 3 envelopes.. <br /><br />ACE

				Yes, so when people write bank robbery notes, they can see the oil stain right on the paper,<br /><br />&nbsp;i believe it can be easily done at home. In a science lab, Serous shit, they pour in a bottle cap full of....super glue.... on to a dish, in to a small oven looking box, and place.... super glue.... dish with the paper you are testing. The super glue evaporates and the fumes attach themselves on to the oil, which is on the paper..... showing you.......... a perfect thumbprint.<br /><br />Always wear gloves for things like packing envelopes, with addresses of costumers.

Grabbing prints from a piece of paper would be commonplace at this point in time. <br /><br />Furthering what ecstacydude said, wear multiple layers of gloves, ideally a pair of Rubber gloves worn over a pair of fuzzy gloves (gardening gloves maybe). Those rubber gloves can be so thin that while it wont allow for the oil on your finger to leave a print, if you had some residue on your gloves, its possible that fingerprints can be transfered via that medium. Wearing the fuzzy gloves under the rubber gloves helps to eliminate this issue.

				A few things:<br /><br />Fingerprinting is not exactly standard procedure. While it&#039;s not a specialized thing either, I guarantee you that swabbing for fingerprints is the last thing LE is going to attempt after seizing an envelope full of drugs. For a few reasons:<br /><br />A) Multiple people have likely handled that envelope. While most if not all systems used to organize letters in the United States are completely automated nowadays, it&#039;s not too far-fetched for a worker here and there to pick it up and throw it into a basket or something.<br />B) Besides what CSI has taught you, there is no such thing as a global database containing every single persons full set of fingerprints in the world. The only reason your government would have a full set is if you were a convicted felon. Also I believe certain government jobs require you to sign up with your fingerprints. Don&#039;t hold me to that though.<br />C) Unless it&#039;s a huge shipment of Pseudoephedrine, ergotamine or crystal LSD, most of the time it&#039;s simply not worth the effort, time and money to MAYBE pull a partial fingerprint that will probably not even produce a match, which they will forever have in a huge database with other unrelated crimes and fingerprints, waiting for that lucky host to get arrested one day.

				Some people saying they won&#039;t bother with fingerprints on small packages.&nbsp; Maybe not if you live in a 3rd world country (they&#039;ll just steal the package), but SR has been in the news and LE is seriously into finding vendors.&nbsp; At least in the US.&nbsp; Apparently even moreso in Australia.&nbsp; They want to catch people marketing through the mail.&nbsp; They WILL check fingerprints on captured packages.&nbsp; It takes them very little effort, as packages are small.&nbsp; They may not have all fingerprints in the world, but US at least DOES HAVE a national database which contains prints from anyone ever ARRESTED FOR ANYTHING in the US unless they were not convicted AND went through a process to have their info removed.&nbsp; Anyone who has been fingerprinted for anything is in their too.&nbsp; Many jobs require fingerprinting.&nbsp; Your parents may have had you fingerprinted in case you ever got lost as a kid.&nbsp; They try to get as many people as possible in there.&nbsp; Fingerprinting has been a thing since the 1800s which is why even the DUMBEST criminals know to wear gloves.<br /><br />WEAR YOUR FUCKING GLOVES.&nbsp; FFS people!

				What you said was mostly on point, besides the Job thing. <br />Most jobs DO require fingerprinting -- however, in the vast majority of these cases they are simply checking to see if your fingerprints are in any databases, to check if you&#039;re a felon, pedofile, have a warrant out for your arrest, whatever. It simply scans and throws away the scans after they don&#039;t find anything. I talked rather in depth to the man who was fingerprinting me for a job a year or so ago and he assured me that my fingerprints were NOT going to some database; government or otherwise, the system would simply check for positives in the system. <br />I&#039;m sure there are exceptions to this, but I thought I would clear this up.

My ex-boyfriend pled no contest to a felony charge and wasn&#039;t convicted but still had to do probation and pay fines and all that crap. He still had to submit his DNA in.

				If you are arrested for anything, they take your fingerprints. Even if your case is dropped later, your fingerprints are in a database somewhere. So far, they&#039;ve mostly been taking DNA samples from convicted felons, as noted earlier, but I believe that is going to change. In ten years, they will probably be taking DNA samples from everyone who gets arrested.<br /><br />DNA is much more accurate than fingerprints. With fingerprints, it&#039;s not like CSI where you see a million images flash across the screen and then they get 100% match. They find a collection of similar fingerprints and a human decides whether they have a match. With DNA, they use a collection of 13 short tandem repeats. Every person has a unique combination of those STRs, except identical twins. Identifying a unique individual is more straight forward. For now, fingerprinting is cheaper, but the cost of genotyping is falling fast and will eventually replace fingerprinting.<br /><br />The other advantage of DNA is that you shed it from every surface of your body, so it doesn&#039;t rely on just the tips of your fingers coming into contact with a crime scene.

				This is really common sense, If you are vending wear gloves or you won&#039;t last long. The very least LE would do is fingerprint the contents of the letter and match it against their database. They would do this for orders as small as a gram to think otherwise is really putting your security at risk...

I probably already knew that but, was re-affirmed yesterday and again with astors post.
