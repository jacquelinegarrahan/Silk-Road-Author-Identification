				Mr computer forensics seems to be gone and nobody answered my question there, so let&#039;s try it here:<br /><br />The suggestion was: use a bootable (readonly) linux cd.<br />I don&#039;t fully understand why not a liberte usb stick running on readonly? That&#039;s the same right?<br />(without a harddrive in the pc ofcourse).<br /><br />I tried that and went to some website to check the stealth and it found that the tcp/udp ports were not stealthed. For this there would be a firewall needed I suppose?<br />How to solve this?<br /><br />Advice would be greatly appreciated&nbsp; 8)

				c&#039;mon there has to be somebody out here who knows about this? Or are people just massively getting bootable usb&#039;s/cd&#039;s with no harddrive but with an unstealthed tcp/udp?<br />Maybe they don&#039;t need to be stealthy but my bet is that they should be.

				It would be more about if I trust the liberte software to really be readonly when booting it readonly.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure of what website I used. I just installed liberte on an usb, put it on readonly, then used it&#039;s browser and searched for stealth checkers. It did not show my own ip, which was good. But it told me that my tcp/udp ports were not stealth.<br />I think it&#039;s probably basic IT knowledge. But I can&#039;t remember how it was all connected. <br /><br />So let&#039;s put it this way: what is the harm of somebody knowing my true ip, and having unprotected tcp/udp ports? <br />And what is the harm if it&#039;s not my ip address? Are those unstealthed tcp ports even mine, does it matter at all? If so, what does it matter?<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to believe it doesn&#039;t matter, or just that nobody cares. But if somehow the mac address would become visible (I guess not, but I&#039;m not sure), then that would be very fucked up since those can usually be traced very easily.<br /><br />Sigh.. where is mr computer forensics when you need him? Maybe he himself got busted, then we&#039;re all doomed&nbsp; :P

				Ok, you are affirming my thoughts that it does not matter.<br /><br />Thanks!
