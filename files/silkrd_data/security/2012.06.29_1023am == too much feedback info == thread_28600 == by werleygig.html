				has anyone else noticed that some people leave way too much information in feedback?&nbsp; i realize that people are happy and want to share, but when I see feedback like &#039;ordered on friday, he shipped it on saturday, i got it on wednesday on the east coast&#039; i can&#039;t help but think to myself that is way too much information.&nbsp; other things, too, that might tend to describe a profile<br /><br />i know people want to help, but really how much more do we need beyond &#039;shipping was fast and product was good&#039; well okay maybe say that the packaging was good, but here also i see some people being a little too fluid with the informations<br /><br />anyone else with me on this one?

				That&#039;s the whole point of the feedback system, if I am not mistaken. <br />It gives people an idea of who they are buying from and how long they should expect a package to arrive to their destination.<br />If people need stuff in a hurry, the feedback might be the difference between them ordering from a particular vendor or not ordering from them.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents anyway...

				I see what he&#039;s saying, too much information like paid for this day, shipped this day, received this day is kind of too much information. It can help law enforcement break down a pattern and try to figure out the vendor. Even so called &quot;random&quot; drops can end up in a pattern. Should be more like took 4 days to get here instead of saying which days. Seeing how some people don&#039;t even finalize till they try their product, even though they received it, kind of doesn&#039;t give anyone anything. Remember, governments would rather spend billions of dollars fighting an winnable war rather than feeding the poor or something actually important.
