				If I encrypt a txt file OpenGPG (I&#039;m an OSX user.) creates a .gpg file with the encrypted contents.<br /><br />However, opening that gpg file into textedit and then copying and pasting that encrypted information seems like it may not work.<br /><br />This leads to probably the most noobish question on this board: Is it common etiquette for the encrypted message to be attached, or is there another way to go about this?<br /><br />I AM NOT using a mail client that encrypts text for me, so this is not a thunderbird/mail.app question, but more a generic encryption question for web based mail.

				I had the same issue.<br /><br />What I did was type the message into TextEdit, then highlight the message, then select (on the menu bar) TextEdit--&gt;Services--&gt;Open PGP: Encrypt.&nbsp; Select the recipient&#039;s public key and you&#039;re good to go with a message that begins like this:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----<br />Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)<br />Comment: GPGTools - http://gpgtools.org<br /><br />hQIOAxVS+5wS636jEAf/cXQwCxCnezh7p+pp/0NxGU10kRSeRpwtscH1NKIIFPRP<br />etc etc<br /><br />Hope that helps

				I don&#039;t use osx, but here&#039;s how I think most people do it (I do it this way in windows):<br /><br />Highlight and copy the actual text of the message.<br />Encrypt the text itself using the clipboard function of your gpg, you&#039;ll have to select a recipient for this part.<br />Paste encrypted text into the message box.<br />Be sure to give the recipient your public key, or they can&#039;t decrypt the msg.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using command lines, then I can&#039;t help you.<br /><br />You can encrypt the file, then send the .gpg file to the recipient and they could then decrypt it and access it. But personally, I wouldn&#039;t open an attachment or file from someone here unless I knew/trusted them. Not sure if there&#039;s a consensus on this.<br /><br />Hope that helps, like I said, I don&#039;t use OSx and my encryption is GPG4Win. <br /><br />Edit: Yeah, what Linus said... But my answer to the thread title stands. I doubt anyone&#039;s gonna open an attachment from someone on a site we&#039;re all using specifically to remain anonymous. <br />

				By default PGP often encrypts in binary mode. What you want for ease is &quot;ASCII armored&quot; mode, ie the version we can cut and paste.<br /><br />Don&#039;t upload files if you can avoid it, because depending on the exact details, that can reveal the file&#039;s full name &amp; path (eg /users/yourname/documents/somefile.txt), and boom you just deanonymized yourself. :-P
