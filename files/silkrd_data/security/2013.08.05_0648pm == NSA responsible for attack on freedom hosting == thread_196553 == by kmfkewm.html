Maybe people can open their eyes and realize both sides of the political &quot;isle&quot; are effectively the same. Differences between Republicans and Democrats are cosmetic only. If you don&#039;t support a third party, this is the type of behavior you endorse.<br /><br />Reminds me of Simpsons joke where Kang and Kodos the two evil aliens take over Bob Dole and Bill Clinton... The two party system can eat my asshole.

Sabre rattling on the NSA&#039;s part to scare certain individuals from thinking of using Tor in the hopes that they will just stay put on the regular clearnet... seeing as you&#039;re not safe on Tor so why bother going through the hassle of installing a simple software bundle. Basically, they want to kill the momentum Tor picked up after Snowden&#039;s revelation. <br /><br />kmfkewm&#039;s right though. We ARE under attack by a military organization. I guess they want their Tor network back. <br />

				Did you read the article?<br /><br />&quot;Further analysis using a DNS record tool from Robtex found that the address was actually part of several blocks of IP addresses allocated by SAIC to the NSA. This immediately spooked the researchers.&quot;<br /><br />So it is the NSA.<br /><br />

Tor is a means to become &quot;foreign&quot;. So Tor falls under the department of the NSA, which gets to use the &quot;child porn&quot; &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;narcotics&quot; reasoning to share info under the grounds of national security. I find it really difficult to believe the general public would care if the alphabet mafia is sharing info between each other when they just arrested the FH guy on grounds of running the worlds largest child porn network. Tell me it isn&#039;t coincidental this FBI story broke last week, then this freedom hosting thing went down. The government is trying to drum up support for surveillance by appealing to the general disdain for child porn. <br /><br />http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/29/fbi-arrests-150-76-city-child-prostitution-ring/<br /><br />Federal Bureau of Investigations agents arrested 150 suspects on Monday on charges related to a child prostitution ring that wove through 76 cities around the nation.<br /><br />Agents also recovered 105 children who were believed to have been involved in the ring, USA Today reported.<br /><br />The FBI made the arrests in a three-day sweep. It’s the largest law enforcement raid that the agency has conducted in relation to child prostitution, USA Today said.<br /><br />“Child prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across American,” said Ron Hosko, assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, in USA Today. “This operation serves as a reminder that these abhorrent crimes can happen anywhere and that the FBI remains committed to stopping this cycle of victimization and holding the criminals who profit from this exploitation accountable.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>105 childeren?

				A part of me jumps up with the OP shouting YESSSSS!!&nbsp; &nbsp;but then the other, more experienced part of me, quietly sighs&nbsp; &quot;shit!&quot; ....<br /><br />Becoz, these &quot;problems&quot; didn&#039;t just happen in the last few weeks!&nbsp; <br />These things took time to build, with hundreds of thousands&nbsp; of people &quot;co-operating&quot; to create things like PRISM et al.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; The REAL &quot;problem&quot; IS,&nbsp; &nbsp;that it&#039;s &quot;you and me&quot; who let things like PRISM get built in the first place, by &quot;allowing these cunts their &quot;black budgets&quot; etc&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&nbsp;And these are people we ALL KNOW, people who work &#039;for the government&#039;,&nbsp; in what they see as &#039;their irrelevant job in IT ... with a small company that SUB-CONTRACTS to the military to make this shit&#039;, some ASIC they dont really know what it&#039;s going to be used for .... which, in fact is a part of a guidance system that when added to a bunch of &#039;other shit&#039; becomes a drone or cruise missile!&nbsp; :o :(<br /><br />&nbsp; IF these people &quot;knew about what&nbsp; they DID&quot; and then thoughtfully considered the effects of their work on everyone, and the planet they live on!<br />, and CHOSE to stop doing it. things would begin to change!&nbsp; Being a geologist can be a fine job,...being a geologist who&#039;s helping &#039;fuck things up&#039; by working for a &#039;frackinng company&#039; which pollutes the groundwater for miles around&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; Now that&#039;s NOT a cool job! IMO!&nbsp; And they&#039;re are many more .... I wouldn&#039;t work for McDonalds ..... but the issue is that for basic wage type jobs, people often cant &#039;pick and choose&#039; becoz they need the money, whereas the geologist on $120+k, p.a. could save more in one year than these folks could pronanly save in ten! <br /><br />What I&#039;m saying, is the people in the &quot;most important jobs&quot; ... ones which MUST STOP/CHANGE now, asap, are the one who CAN AFFORD TO, but, they&#039;re probably SO TRAPPED in their lifestyle, that they &quot;depend on that income&quot; to &quot;maintain THEIR standard of living&quot; ..sheesh! <br /><br />And they&#039;ll say, &quot;they&#039;re not hurting anyone&quot; ....&nbsp; But are they sure? After all, Mike works at Boeing as an engineer, and makes a good salary, They&#039;re so &#039;lucky&#039; becoz&nbsp; they&nbsp; appreciate the &#039;finer things&#039;&nbsp; and &#039;the money makes life easier&#039;...... <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;While people needlessly die all around the world becoz their family maket &quot;air plane parts&quot; for the Air Force, and have been since WW1!&nbsp; :o :o&nbsp; &nbsp;These people, who&#039;s mind are so focused on themselves, are common, and then they go to a &quot;Revival Christian Church&quot; and &#039;believe in God, and Jesus saves and the Bible&#039; .... <br />Oh&nbsp; &nbsp;God fuckin&nbsp; help me!&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you see what &#039;we&#039;re&#039; up against!

The NSA’s public website, NSA.gov, is served by the same upstream Verizon network as the Tor malware command-and-control server, but that network handles tons of government agencies and contractors in the Washington DC area.<br /><br />source:&nbsp; http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/freedom-hosting/<br /><br />Although the Patriot Act gave the NSA some new and broad powers for domestic surveillance, this operation appears to be more criminal in nature than an issue of national security and thus outside of their jurisdiction.&nbsp; It&#039;s more than likely FBI.<br /><br />And to those that would scoff about issues of jurisdiction in regards to NSA acts, consider what the exploits were hoping to accomplish.&nbsp; They were attempting to identify users involved in some seriously depraved criminality for the purpose of prosecution.&nbsp; The FBI, not the NSA, has authority in this regard.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Considering it just broke that the NSA has been sharing criminal intelligence with the DEA, I think it makes sense to assume they are sharing criminal intelligence with the FBI as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That may be a safe assumption but doesn&#039;t necessarily make it true in this particular case, particularly considering that the DEA was going to great lengths to hide NSA involvement through the use of &#039;parallel construction&#039; to build a criminal case against those caught by NSA information.&nbsp; That being a necessity since the information used to make those arrests was obtained unconstitutionally, and would have been unusable in a court of law.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the link to the article, but there was an LE official quoted as saying that defendants who refused plea deals and instead chose to fight it in court had the charges dismissed to avoid potentially revealing NSA involvement and to prevent LE perjury in court.<br /><br />The idea that NSA was surely involved came from the misreading of the DNS records, as I quoted above.&nbsp; Without that, it would be merely speculative that the NSA was involved even with the revelations about NSA involvement in domestic criminal activity.<br /><br />Further, would you agree that the exploit was designed to de-anonymize individuals who were accessing cp?&nbsp; That&#039;s indisputably obvious, right?&nbsp; Would it be safe to assume from that then that the feds are seeking to identify those individuals for prosecution?&nbsp; That&#039;s a fairly safe assumption, too, isn&#039;t it?&nbsp; And if that&#039;s true, I find it extremely unlikely that the feds would risk jeopardizing their criminal cases by contaminating it with NSA surveillance since it would be impossible to claim &#039;parallel construction&#039; even if they wanted to perjure themselves (or ask any of their agents/employees to, which they should rightly refuse).<br /><br />
