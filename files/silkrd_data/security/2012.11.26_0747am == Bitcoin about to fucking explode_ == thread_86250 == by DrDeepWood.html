				Looks like there is around 2 days left until the difficulty of producing bitcoins doubles.&nbsp; BTC has been on a slow steady rise and is poised to explode in all the excitement about the halving date as well as the new butterfly labs mining chips.&nbsp; Last time BTC was this high (12.5) and increased just a little more, it exploded up to 30.&nbsp; I think the estimate is that if bitcoin is around 14-15 dollars right around the halving date, it will explode in the aftermath.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Do we have any bitcoin economists here?

				God damn i wish i could GET SOME. Is investing in bitcoins literally a short term easy money making investment? It seems like it! But I could have it all wrong.

				The lack of liquidity can be a problem indeed. <br /><br />I often buy BTC using the bitstamp.net exchange since that is very convenient with EU bank accounts.<br /><br />The volume on there sometimes is very thin though. Usually i can buy at rates a bit below mtgox (13.22 vs ~13.50 yesterday), but only in small amounts. <br /><br />Trading volumes of $100 isn&#039;t a problem, though you can get much better rates with a day of patience most of the time. Trading $10.000 becomes tricky there though (you&#039;d be driving prices) and $100k in a day would severely affect the rate on that exchange. <br /><br />On the other hand its not that uncommon to have a fairly large split between sell and buy prices in real world currencies either. The difference between buy and sale prices for a currency like indonsian rupiah vs the dollar or euro are often a few percent, despite over 200 million people using that currency for their daily life.

				The difficulty has already been raised and the rewards already cut in half. This happened on the 210 000th Block a few weeks ago, As for butterfly labs, They were supposed to start delivering products weeks ago. They came out and stated that there would likely be a few more months before the rigs are ready, to add to that, they aren&#039;t even selling the old machines anymore. Also the 3 others have all made similar statements regarding their new machines and shipping time. If you ask me I think there is one company behind the 4, that offer mining rigs and all are working together. One has no chips, the other has no boards, the other has no whatever. Its fishy whats going on there and if you are on the bitcoin forums you will see I am not the only one who thinks like this.<br /><br />We see the bitcoin climbing for the next few years, and then, there will be an explosion. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re aware of this but in the last few weeks the company Wordpress announced that they now take payment in the form of Bitcoin. Wordpress powers many websites, such as Forbes, The New York Times, Volkswagen and about 57 million more sites.<br /><br />BTC is the future. Dont be surprised if in 10 years its worth 500-600$ each.<br /><br />Magic

				What I worry about the Wordpress announcement is they explicitly said that it would allow them to accept payments from people in countries like Iran, but they are an American company and it is illegal to do business with people in Iran, Cuba and some other countries. It could end up getting them in a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Still, it&#039;s a great way to get an anonymous clearnet web site. Since Wordpress will register a domain for you, you can pay them in bitcoins to get your own domain, remove the advertising, and add other features. With static front pages, it&#039;s more like a CMS than a blog, and you can create a normal looking web site. Of course, you&#039;ll have to access it over Tor.

				Believe me, I want all that to be true. When governments no longer control money, that is a game changer. I&#039;m just not as optimistic as you. A plausible alternative outcome is that bitcoin gets banned because (governments say) it is used by terrorists and major criminals for money laundering. How do you ban a decentralized currency? Easy, you ban the exchanges, the weak point in the whole system. No more direct bank transfers, no more cash despots at banks and pharmacies.<br /><br />Sure, not every country would ban exchanges. Maybe they will move to banana republics, but it would create a significant barrier to bitcoin adoption. People have enough trouble acquiring bitcoins. :)

				I wish I had bought $1000 worth of BTC in 2010 when I first heard of it and it was trading at 25 cents. I&#039;d have $54,000 today. :)<br /><br />I still think it&#039;s a good idea to buy BTC, though, even at $13.50. I&#039;d be surprised if it wasn&#039;t worth $20 by the end of 2013. A 30% annual ROI is fantastic.

In the first post of ours that you quoted, we were simply pointing out that precious metals are already at a all time high and unless your scenario plays out we don&#039;t see the value going up a large % over the next few years. We do however see this POSSIBILITY with btc, although the risk is much grater. In the second quote of ours we were explaining that gold has been around forever and wont be going anywhere anytime soon, and, for a conservative investor the buck stops at gold and never even looks at btc. If you go out and buy 10 oz of gold at&nbsp; $18000 or you go buy 18000$ worth of btc, the safer investment would be the gold because even if it drops its going to be a small drop, unlike the btc which could go to 4$ overnight for all we know. Its still to early to advise people to invest their life savings in btc over gold but there are better investments then both out there. Savings Bonds, physical land, ect.<br /><br />While we condone btc as an investment for a gambler we would not suggest it to a conservative investor as the risks are still unknown and can break the bank in minutes, unlike gold which will hold a value till this world ends. So to recap, We like btc as a short term investment for people who have money to lose, we also think gold is high now and there are better options then both. Gold will always be worth money and as for btc, we cant say the same at this moment in time. Were sorry if we confused you but we think we cleared it up, if you have any questions feel free to ask.<br /><br />Magic

That is determined by the supply-demand ratio, and since the supply is fixed (well, it increases over time but at a steady, known rate), the price is basically determined by demand. If more fiat currency is converted to BTC, the price goes up, and if more BTC is sold for fiat currency, the price goes down. You can watch the bitcoin charts and see the fluctuations sometimes after large movements of currency.<br /><br />The ASIC processors will change mining difficulty (if they ever come out), but that will only affect the miner profit margin, which is negative right now. After the reward halved, they started losing money, because they spend more on equipment and electricity then they get back through the reward. If it isn&#039;t profitable, then some people should leave the game and mining difficulty will go down, costing less, until it&#039;s profitable again. That hasn&#039;t happened yet.<br /><br />https://blockchain.info/charts/miners-operating-profit-margin

				I hope this isn&#039;t too far off topic, would anyone care to say how or where BTC should be parked for long term storage or holding onto? Are online wallets okay for that purpose? I have mine on a thumb drive and the URLs written down and stowed safely. Thank you very much, happy holidays!

				Online wallets probably aren&#039;t the best idea if you want to store them for the long term or as a safeguard in case of economic breakdown. You essentially rely on the existence of the wallet service to be able to get your bitcoins. Storing them locally with good encryption would be preferable. Note that you can make regular backups of your locally stored BTC - as long as you don&#039;t spend them, a backup is just as good as the original harddisk that held them.<br /><br /><br />As for investment for the long term, its hard to compare bitcoin to gold. <br /><br />Gold has intrinsic value - both for making things like jewelry as for industrial application. It is unlikely this demand would suddenly disappear completely, though not totally impossible if gold is replaced with something else in industry and falls out of fashion for jewelry. <br /><br />The upward potential of gold is somewhat limited: at high prices more of it can be mined economically, and at even higher prices it can be synthesized from mercury in nuclear reactors. The latter isn&#039;t all that feasible right now, but by the time you hit a million dollars an ounce it becomes very viable capping the gold price at that. <br /><br />BTC are very different: They have no intrinsic value, no industrial application, no appeal to possess. However, the total number of bitcoin that can ever be created is limited, making the upward potential unlimited if it were to replace other currency. Even if some technological breakthrough came around that allowed someone to mine all possible bitcoins overnight, their value would not go near zero since there is just so many that can be mined, no matter how efficiently that is done.<br /><br />A threat to bitcoin value could be replacement by another similar system. As it is bitcoin has some drawbacks, mainly rather slow transfer times making it impossible to make on the go purchases. I think its feasible that another cryptocurrency can replace btc allowing quick payment. If that new currency gains popularity bitcoins would decrease in value since people would switch to the new cryptocurrency. <br /><br /><br />So, as investment advise, i would not suggest keeping a large portion of your assets in bitcoin. Given the large upward potential and the downward risk i&#039;d consider it a speculative investment. Not something to rely on, but given the upward potential it could be very attractive to keep 0.1 to 1% of your assets in bitcoin. If it were to truly skyrocket you&#039;d stand to double your total assets over a short period of time, but when it fails you only lose a single percent. <br /><br />Gold is at this moment a very tricky thing too though - there still is upward potential, but on the long term its probably downward, provided we ever get out of the current crisis. Personally i&#039;m not inclined to buy gold at current market rates, other commodities seem more interesting.&nbsp;

You essentially rely on the existence of the wallet service to be able to get your bitcoins. Storing them locally with good encryption would be preferable. Note that you can make regular backups of your locally stored BTC - as long as you don&#039;t spend them, a backup is just as good as the original harddisk that held them.<br /><br /><br />As for investment for the long term, its hard to compare bitcoin to gold. <br /><br />Gold has intrinsic value - both for making things like jewelry as for industrial application. It is unlikely this demand would suddenly disappear completely, though not totally impossible if gold is replaced with something else in industry and falls out of fashion for jewelry. <br /><br />The upward potential of gold is somewhat limited: at high prices more of it can be mined economically, and at even higher prices it can be synthesized from mercury in nuclear reactors. The latter isn&#039;t all that feasible right now, but by the time you hit a million dollars an ounce it becomes very viable capping the gold price at that. <br /><br />BTC are very different: They have no intrinsic value, no industrial application, no appeal to possess. However, the total number of bitcoin that can ever be created is limited, making the upward potential unlimited if it were to replace other currency. Even if some technological breakthrough came around that allowed someone to mine all possible bitcoins overnight, their value would not go near zero since there is just so many that can be mined, no matter how efficiently that is done.<br /><br />A threat to bitcoin value could be replacement by another similar system. As it is bitcoin has some drawbacks, mainly rather slow transfer times making it impossible to make on the go purchases. I think its feasible that another cryptocurrency can replace btc allowing quick payment. If that new currency gains popularity bitcoins would decrease in value since people would switch to the new cryptocurrency. <br /><br /><br />So, as investment advise, i would not suggest keeping a large portion of your assets in bitcoin. Given the large upward potential and the downward risk i&#039;d consider it a speculative investment. Not something to rely on, but given the upward potential it could be very attractive to keep 0.1 to 1% of your assets in bitcoin. If it were to truly skyrocket you&#039;d stand to double your total assets over a short period of time, but when it fails you only lose a single percent. <br /><br />Gold is at this moment a very tricky thing too though - there still is upward potential, but on the long term its probably downward, provided we ever get out of the current crisis.

Thank you Ben!
