But I think you must be referrring to the actual cash to BTC process, usually done by cash deposits at a bank, although there are others. I guess 5% is the cheapest you will find for that process. Anybody know of any other, cheaper, way?

				I&#039;d love to hear some feedback from the veteran clients on the matter. I wrote a small post with my thoughts after several purchases and trying several ways to get coin. Feel free to give it a read and chime in with the &quot;best practice&quot;: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20750.msg210559#msg210559 . My summary:<br /><br />*Mt Gox is about as close to market rate and minimal fees as a buyer can get. But there is risk exposure if you fund your Mt Gox with Dwolla, which is connected to your bank account. And you&#039;re looking at 3-5 days before your coins are in hand.<br /><br />*Get-Bitcoin may cost a little more, but the speed and anonymity are worth the cost (I feel).<br /><br />*Now if I can just get a that PO Box without showing two forms of ID, I would sleep like a baby.<br /><br />-eb&nbsp; 8)

How do you transfer mt gox funds to somebody else?<br />And since i never used IRC, is keefe a username on that chat service? Does he use torchat? Without revealing anything sensitive, how does he do that?<br /><br />Thanks.
