				Just &#039;tumble&#039; the BTC before SR. I&#039;ve watched my BTC coin download onto my computer before, and it doesn&#039;t take long, and then it might take a while to confirm the download. Other times it&#039;s taken a half hour. There is some way to do it by paying a small amount extra, and it downloads extra fast, but I&#039;ve never done that. <br />I would guess today was pretty busy, it might take longer<br />I never heard of Campbx, is it a major BTC place?
