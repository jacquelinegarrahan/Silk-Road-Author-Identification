				I have figured out PGP but want to save my public key and bookmarks etc so I have...<br /><br />Cloned tails from DVD to USB stick, have created a passphrase and set up to keep PGP keys, bookmarks etc, but I am following steps to view your persistent folder and can&#039;t seem to find it.<br /><br />I go to...<br /><br />Places tab ---&nbsp; Home Folder then the only folder I can see available to click on is desktop, it says on tails intstructions their should be a persistent folder? Anyway I can&#039;t seem to find it and also how do I save things like bookmarks to this folder, if I do the normal bookmarking Bookmarks --- Bookmark this page etc will get wiped when I restart computer right?

				You have to create a persistent volume first, its under the main dropdown menu. This can only be done if you created your live usb from within tails using the tails usb program also in the main dropdown menu. If that doesnt work then try asking on the tails forum.

				IMHO your better off with a Live DVD running tails, and just creating an encrypted USB drive that you can mount once you get into tails.

This way, even if I was raided, and cops booted into Tails with any of the USB drives in my house, itl never pop up asking me if I want to mount the persistant volume on said inserted USB drive. Its just another layer of seperating tails from your SR data. The more layers and seperations you can create the better. If shit hits the fan, you want LE to jump through every possible hoop you can set up, imo.

				you need to boot the usb and create the persistent volume from there. i know its convenient to save pgp keys etc but i dont see the point really. the vendor will always have their pgp key on their profile and its so simple to import it, encrypt a message and shut down tails with no trace of you using it. i do use the persistents drive to hold my truecrypt file container&nbsp; which has a text file with all the links and passwords to the sites i use... even the text file is password protected and encrypted with 7zip... 3 layers of encryption! beast

I just thought a vendor would need your key also and if you didnt save it you would have a new public key every time you started tails?

				When you created the Tails Persistent Volume, you were given the option for choosing what you want saved on the new volume, like PGP keys and Internet Bookmarks among other things.<br /><br />Did you check them? i think you can get to them through Tails Persistence Settings or something like that
