				I may be flamed for this, its a tough question with no clear answer, but here goes:<br /><br />It seems that many people on this forum and on SR in general are very aware of the law, computer hacking, and drug use/culture.&nbsp; I can only say I have knowledge of the last one.&nbsp; Because there is such a variety of illegal things sold on SR, the level of anonymity is kept at the highest it can be, to guarantee safety for all.&nbsp; And that is how it should be.<br /><br />BUT,&nbsp; My question is, how far will &quot;the government&quot; (I&#039;m referring to the US) go to bust someone buying a trivial amount of nearly legalized drugs, say under an ounce of weed, mushrooms or lsd, or some other low level drug?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it cost more in the long run, and be more labor intensive to detain or arrest someone for trivial drug purchases than simply not pursuing?&nbsp; Everyone smokes and sells weed where I live and it is practically subsidized by the government anyway! Never in my life have I heard of a mushroom drug bust. Is there really a need to transfer BC through multiple temporary wallets, send it through BitcoinFog, etc, for such low level drug purchases?<br /><br />I guess the real question I ask is:&nbsp; How often, and for what, does the government actually intervene?&nbsp; I am a newb to this site, and with all the precautions and warnings, people seem a bit hypersensitive when it comes to security, for the amount of people that are actually getting caught.&nbsp; Am I freaking myself out unneccesarily?&nbsp; ARE people getting caught ordering things off SR?

Stewart at the Annual Convention of the Midwest Political Science Association 2011, outlays for state and local homeland security spending are approximately $10 billion per year, so if that puts anything into perspective it&#039;s that for a site with a reported turnover of $21.60-28M per annum depending on source, the absence of a little extra security on a site like Silk Road is almost worthy of being punished. <br /><br />(SR is pretty tame when it comes to b-m selling, SR doesn&#039;t sell RPGs, SAMs, body parts or even munitions so I guess there isn&#039;t a HUGE &quot;variety of illegal things sold on SR&quot;; there&#039;s no shortage of hidden listings that provide this; I&#039;d say SR is quite prudently reserved in its market.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=100532.msg704343#msg704343">Quote from: maker1234 on January 05, 2013, 06:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BUT,&nbsp; My question is, how far will &quot;the government&quot; (I&#039;m referring to the US) go to bust someone buying a trivial amount of nearly legalized drugs, say under an ounce of weed, mushrooms or lsd, or some other low level drug?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it cost more in the long run, and be more labor intensive to detain or arrest someone for trivial drug purchases than simply not pursuing?&nbsp; Everyone smokes and sells weed where I live and it is practically subsidized by the government anyway!

				Two ways people get caught:<br /><br />1) They run there damn mouth!! If you tell one person you mine as well tell everyone. Don&#039;t tell ANYONE you get shit in the mail.<br /><br />2) The post office fucks up or you&#039;re package breaks and opens or dogs smell it and then controlled delivery.<br /><br />A kid that i went to high school with got caught with 8 pounds in the mail because someone has the same name as him and it got delivered to the wrong house.

				Personally I really can&#039;t see Law Enforcement at any level really care about &#039;personal amounts&#039; of dope going through the mail. I still have yet to read a news article saying &#039;42 year old cancer patient sentenced to 3 years for importing 3.5g of Marijuana.&#039;<br />The cost associated with discovering such small amounts, documenting, warrants, cross border jurisdiction legalities, etc, etc. All for giving you a good behavior bond or maybe a $400 fine. <br />I really can&#039;t see why it is worth their while. <br />Saying that, if the dog goes off or X-Ray can clearly see something is wrong, I would expect at the very least a letter in the mail saying that you have attempted to import a restricted product.<br />

It&#039;s better for people not to know than to know and say, this could be used for drugs but technically might not. In my town, I daresay the majority would not even have heard of BTC or The Onion Router (Tor) and it would be easy to remember the 1 or 2 that do have BTC. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of disinformation regarding Tor. &quot;Darknet&quot; for phuc sake. Straight out of Batman or something. They assume that if you use Tor you are looking ^ child pornography. Same with bitcoins. No, it&#039;s not illegal, but because some people use its anonymity to circumvent the law these armchair technologists will jump to yet another conspiracy theory-like conclusion and fore conclude everyone who buys BTC is ordering hits or buying off Silk Road. It&#039;s amazing how attention-seeking some people are.<br /><br />So, I&#039;d be keeping it on the DL myself, as low knowledge of subject matter + wild imagination + occurrence of a person obtaining bitcoins + nosy parker + jump to conclusion + resulting needless investigation = shit you just don&#039;t need, sister.<br /><br />Prevention is better than cure.<br /><br />Piece out. Bank safely.

It was seen as an epidemic. In 2001, the federal government quadrupled the length of sentences for ecstasy possession. There are probably more people doing ecstasy today, but the media, and consequently the legislative bodies, are not focused on it and don&#039;t care.<br /><br />The best guideline is to read your local paper and see what kinds of drugs and amounts are getting busted.
