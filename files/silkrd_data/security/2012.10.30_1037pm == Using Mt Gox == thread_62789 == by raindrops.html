				So like many others I&#039;m sure, I&#039;m confuzzled after bitinstant changed many of their deposit options. So, it looks like Mt. Gox is a good possibility to use instead of the now-unavailable straight to instawallet? How do you transfer bitcoin out of Mt Gox? Can you just send it to a wallet (or SR wallet) address? Also, do you have to have your account verified to transfer funds out of it?<br /><br />Thanks!

				For small amounts (&lt; $1k maybe?) you don&#039;t need to verify - just register on clearnet, provide a TORMAIL or other anonymous E-Mail addy.&nbsp; To transfer BTC out, go to FUNDING OPTIONS, WITHDRAW FUNDS.&nbsp; It prompts for a BTC address and amount.&nbsp; EasyPeasy.

				mtgox&#039;s limit is you can not transfer more then 200 btc per 24 hours unless you verity your account with an id. that being said, you can transfer out 200btc and wait 24 hours and transfer out again.

				Mt. Gox will freeze your acount if you use tor or a public proxy, so if you want to be anonymous on tor, you&#039;ll need to use a public wifi location for a bit of anonymity. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about it though- just use 2-3 fresh instawallet accounts on tor (never re-use wallets/BTC addresses if goal is anonymity) to transfer your funds through to the SR tumbler.

				First post here...Just want to clarify some things as I&#039;ve never done this before!<br /><br />I plan on making a Mt. Gox account with a tormail e-mail address.&nbsp; I will then purchase bitcoins ( &lt;$300 worth ).&nbsp; I then plan on sending those bitcoins to a wallet I have set up on btcfog.&nbsp; I will then cycle those bitcoins through other wallets on btcfog.&nbsp; I will then transfer the bitcoins left over from btcfog to my SR wallet.&nbsp; <br /><br />My questions:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; will a tormail e-mail raise suspicion or should I just use a throwaway? (note that I know not to access mt gox via tor)<br /><br />2) If 1 is true and I am flagged or something similar, can they discern if the wallet I send to is a btcfog wallet versus others?&nbsp; The goal of btcfog as I understand is to make your bitcoins untraceable so maybe this would not be a problem anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />3)&nbsp; I still need to brush up on my PGP knowledge and skills before I purchase, but if the above is a good plan for getting bitcoins, is there any issue with just going ahead and getting them into my SR account now?<br /><br />Would definitely appreciate if you see any flaws in this plan or any other advice!

				I would be very cautious with mtgox, we were recently screwed by them. We tried to withdraw 4k from our mtgox acct with an international wire transfer and our money didn&#039;t hit our bank acct for 28 days! All the while i was getting the run around by cust ser. even lying to me about how it only takes 3 days to internationally wire money, that i must be mistaken!
