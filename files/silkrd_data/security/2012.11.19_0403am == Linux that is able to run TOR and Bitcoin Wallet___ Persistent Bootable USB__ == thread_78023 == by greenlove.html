				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to get Bitcoin wallet and TOR onto a bootable version of linux for a while now.&nbsp; I have found versions of linux that will run Bitcoin wallet but will not run TOR and visa versa, but I am yet to find one that will run both.<br /><br />Does anyone know a version of Linux that can run Bitcoin wallet and TOR without having to download a bunch of installer packs etc to get it running?<br /><br />Thanks a ton!

				There&#039;s a Linux version of Bitcoin-QTavailable on bitcoin.org. It works on Tails and I&#039;d imagine it would work on pretty much any Linux OS.

				2.7 GB seems a lot to download over Tor, it would take ages and unnecessarily waste a lot of Tor bandwidth.<br /><br />You could download the blockchain over clearnet and then copy it into your Tails/Liberte/whatever installation, and then set up your anonymous wallet. That way you&#039;d only have to download the latest few blocks over Tor.<br />

				Yep, this was one of the reasons I quit using my own bitcoin wallet, and began trusting cloud spots like instawallet, or, in my case, TradeHill ...and then I&quot;d use either liberte linux if I needed persistence, or Tails if I didn&#039;t ... used SwissDisk for stashing stuff...book luck, interesting problem, if liberte doesn&#039;t work....

				Bitcoin - QT or otherwise - doesn&#039;t run on any Debian systems, of which Tails is one. I looked into it a while ag and there&#039;s nothing which&#039;ll run a bitcoin client on Tails. It should work on other Linux distros - know it works on Ubuntu - but you&#039;ll just need to get that distro into a bootable USB format.

I gave this a shot despite knowing next to nothing about Linux.<br /><br />So whenever I tried anything beginning with bitcoin-qt in the command line, I got an error reading:<br /><br />bash: bitcoin-qt: command not found<br /><br />I figured out that this meant I had to create a path to bitcoin-qt, but I couldn&#039;t figure out how to do that in Tails. So I googled around some more until I discovered the ./ command and ended up using this:<br /><br />./Persistent/bitcoin-qt/bin/32/bitcoin-qt datadir=/home/amensia/Persistent/bitcoin-qt/bin/32/btcdata<br /><br />When I use this command, Bitcoin runs, but I also get an error in the Terminal that says:<br /><br />sendto: Operation not permitted<br /><br />When I run the same command while disconnected from the Internet, I get an error that reads:<br /><br />sendto: Network is unreachable<br /><br />So it runs, but it won&#039;t connect to the network in either case. Encouragingly, a random receiving address is generated, and the /.bitcoin directory is not created under /amnesia- which is what you&#039;d want. It also manages to &quot;remember&quot; the receiving address after being closed and run again from the command line- also good.<br /><br />Less encouragingly, it doesn&#039;t seem to actually be using the directory I specified (home/amensia/Persistent/bitcoin-qt/bin/32/btcdata); nothing ever appears in that directory. In fact, when I change that path to random gibberish, it doesn&#039;t seem to make any difference- the receiving address even remains the same, despite the fact that no wallet.dat file can be found anywhere on the computer. Weird.<br /><br />On the other hand, when I run Bitcoin by simply double-clicking on the icon, everything is as it was before: it generates a new receiving address, creates wallet.dat and other files in the /.bitcoin directory under /amnesia (files that will be wiped out when Tails is shut down), and successfully connects to the network. It run just fine, but it&#039;s all running from memory, so the problem is still that there&#039;s not enough room for the blockchain, whether I download it or swap it in from somewhere else.<br /><br />If you made it this far and have any other suggestions, I&#039;d be happy to try them out. This is kinda fun in a mildly frustrating way. ;)

				I have tails and am thinking about using instawallet. <br /><br />Pretty noob question buy if I did that, how would I backup the links onto another thumb drive? Is the only option to send myself a PGP message via email with the links in it?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Create a persistent volume on tails, save your instawallet links to a gedit file, or open office, whatever.<br /><br />Either just use the links from there or transfer from the tails usb to another usb while in tails.

				You could always setup Whonix. It&#039;s a new 2-VM Tor Distro that allows you to automatically torrify any OS by forcing it through the Whonix Gateway VM.

Bitcoin-QT literally just unpacks and runs in Debian, don&#039;t know where you heard otherwise. Tails is a specific version of Debian, don&#039;t make broad assumptions based on just one distro. Tails is an amnesic OS (hence project amnesia) that is designed to be read-only with an OPTION for persistence, by default it is not available. Regular Debian distro&#039;s support electrum, armory, Satoshi, multibit, etc for Bitcoin clients.
