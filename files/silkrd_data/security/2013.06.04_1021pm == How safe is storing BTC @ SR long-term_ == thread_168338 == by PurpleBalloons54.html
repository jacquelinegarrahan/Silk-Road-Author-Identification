As long as your pin is safe, even if your account is compromised they can&#039;t withdraw or make purchases.<br /><br />That being said, for the most part I would say its safe, though I would also suggest at least one issue. While we may hope (and thanks to the extremely wonderful efforts of the staff, we have an ability to hope) that SR won&#039;t go down, if it does, you won&#039;t have them. That, is all there is to it. It&#039;s safe to say that there would be a chance/likely possibility effort would be made to, at a minimum, get teh site back up no matter what. The possibility for an &quot;end&quot; is always real though.<br /><br />In that worst-ever-possibility, the only true best place to store it is with yourself in a local wallet that is adequately protected.

				Just remember that the BTC you hold is beholden to the whims of the exchange rate. If you&#039;ve mined the coins yourself, more power to you. If you&#039;ve spent money on them, you might want to rethink your strategy.

There are rather major normal transactions, including companies based entirely on BTC itself now. The volatility now is mostly due to its basis on the fragile exchange philosophy as it exists today. <br /><br />Stability will draw from regulation in the exchange landscape. This may seem scary, but it really only ends up being scary when surrounded by overall capital gains. This is inevitable, because really what you are doing is paying tax on the purchase of another currency. You do that already if you convert non-btc currency to other non-btc currency. The &quot;value&quot; will merely become a component of the other currency markets, and ultimately the value will eventually stabilize as both the quantity (which is finite) reaches 100% mined, and transactions become ubiquitous.<br /><br />This does not have any effect on the nature of bitcoin, because ultimately our existence is no different than if we were strictly in the US and paying eachother in person with money from our wallets. Bitcoin serves a purpose in that, if you involve only bitcoin, the value of it is partially irrelevant. The stability of its eventual result, will ultimately help also, as it will reduce overall speculation and allow for a more solid price spectrum for product. Value, is not lost in that situation, merely the conversion of 1BTC -&gt; ###USD will become easier for the layman to understand, and there will be less of a need for true hedging. This may alter the landscape in the opportunity to maintain a bitcoin storage versus simply exchanging it out, but I don&#039;t think so. As BTC becomes more ubiquitous, the available products in the global landscape will grow, and we will be able to survive more/less on our adoption of our currency, rather than totally being tied to our native currency.<br /><br />So, in short, the danger is getting less and less in hedging BTC against the native dollar, but it is still volatile enough that you can risk devaluing your dollar if you buy a lot of bitcoins and tomorrow the value drops. This is, inherently true. But to adhere to this strictly, would ultimatley devalue the need to have BTC at all, and one would not want to invest in order to maintain its liquidity. If we do not believe in it, then it&#039;ll never be what it needs to be.

				I agree with your assessment, offbeatadam. There will definitely have to be some regulatory precedents for BTC to stabilize. Also, there will need to be trusted 3rd parties and a handful of other concepts that the BTC zealots love to claim are 100% obsoleted. In the short term, it&#039;s still very risky to hold BTC that you have converted from a &quot;standard&quot; currency and I just wanted to make sure PurpleBalloons54 was aware of that fact.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: PurpleBalloon54</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Good point.&nbsp; This makes holding onto BTC long-term a risk no matter what.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Only if you purchased those BTC. Which is admittedly the most likely case. Cheers, mate.

				why take the risk ?? I doubt the site would run off with your BTC but if they ever do have to shutdown real quick they might not even be able to do that emergency withdraw thingo you can setup. <br /><br />I personally don&#039;t quite 100% trust those websites which generate btc addy&#039;s / priv keys.. but just use vanitygen and generate a random addy yourself... or start new btc wallet in the normal client.. export private key and encrypt it with GPG and store it in multiple places. Then of course make sure you also backup your GPG keys... :]

				The risk with keeping your coins on SR is unexpected downtime. It&#039;s happened a few times already that the market went down for several days. Sure, it may not happen in the next week or the next few months, but the one time it does happen, you will experience head aches. This is not a problem unique to SR, of course. Ask the people who were storing their coins on Instawallet, or on blockchain.info the times it went offline.<br /><br />I&#039;m only comfortable with storing my coins in my own client, with multiple backups.<br />

Every time I see someone talking about &quot;I can&#039;t send to mtgox anymore!&quot; I cringe, and yet it seems like I see a ton of people that get it right.<br /><br />Did everyone just have to make a mistake the first time, or was there some underhanded tutorial editing on bitcoin.it by mtgox and friends that drove people to believe using them as their wallet was smart?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The seemingly general logic befuddles me. Seriously, its a wallet. Treat it like a wallet. You don&#039;t give your friend your wallet with $1000 in it. Why the hell would you give your wallet to someone you don&#039;t even know, with more?

				Agree 100% Libertas<br /><br />The most secure way I&#039;ve found to manage my bitcoins is using Bitcoin Armory<br /><br />It allows for &#039;offline wallets&#039;. Basically, you approve and sign transactions on an offline machine that is never connected to the internet (or a dual booted one with an encrypted drive). The online computer monitors the blockchain and pushes through signed transactions.<br /><br />Sounds harder than it is and worth piece of mind!

				All they have to do is to make it illegal for any shop to accept bitcoins and then to go after the bitcoin exchanges.&nbsp; Its pretty hard to run a bitcoin exchange if its illegal for any banking service to do business with you. <br /><br />You can have a billion bitcoins but if you cant convert them into anything you can spend and its illegal for any business to accept them directly, they become worthless.

There aren&#039;t many shops that accept gold as a method of payment, but it has not become worthless. It is traded as a commodity. Bitcoin could well have a similar future if &#039;outlawed&#039; due to its potential as a store of value, and the fact that you can transport all of your wealth around on a USB stick or in your head in a brain wallet. If it were &#039;outlawed&#039; and used by &#039;outlaws&#039;, it would skyrocket in value due to the demand for it by the black market with people willing to buy and sell for fiat money to people who want to store their wealth in it / move their money worldwide.

				Bitcoin&#039;s use as a currency should be thought of as an emergent phenomenon borne of what Bitcoin actually IS. It&#039;s what the Bitcoin software (including the network) actually does, how it does it, and the mathematical principles it is based upon that make it suitable to be used as a currency. It&#039;s a strange thing to wrap your head around, but Bitcoin isn&#039;t &quot;designed to be a currency&quot; because currency isn&#039;t something that actually exists. Bitcoin is designed to automate extreme levels of trust, and it is *really* good at doing this[1].<br /><br />One needs to understand that currency is just a common agreement to consider a thing generally acceptable in trade for any given product or service. The currency value of BTC is just a representation of how its users are generally willing to value it. Even if you take away 90% of its users, BTC will&nbsp; likely retain more than enough users to sustain its utility as currency. Perhaps with a painful correction to better reflect the opinion of the new base, but that last 10% will simply become the new 100%.<br /><br /><br /><br />-<br />[1] this is a feeble attempt at putting things in layman&#039;s terms. if you&#039;re interested, read the bitcoin paper and read up on anything in it that you don&#039;t at least roughly understand. Bitcoin is remarkably straightforward in terms of mathematical design.

You then take those addresses and add them to an online computer running Bitcoin (online wallet), and you tell the Armory client that they belong to you. The catch here is that you haven&#039;t actually proven you own them by giving Armory the privkey (watch only), which means you can&#039;t actually complete transactions without involving the data in the offline wallet. In order to transact from addresses in your offline wallet, you must create an unsigned transaction in the online wallet, get that transaction data to the offline wallet for signing, and then take the resulting data back to the online wallet to be sent through the Bitcoin network. <br /><br />This is the first time I&#039;ve seen Armory, and I&#039;m pretty fucking impressed without even downloading it yet. Up until this point, I&#039;ve been keeping the bulk of my stuff in a deterministic wallet. This solves the data loss problem (I lost 3+ BTC to data loss the first time I ever played with Bitcoin), but it does not solve the &quot;I got hacked&quot; problem at all. Armory appears to do this quite well, at least design-wise. Looks like I have a new project on my plate...<br /><br />Hope this helps, DrChong.

				The security added via Armory is simply the fact that money cannot be sent from your online wallet. <br /><br />Transactions must be created offline and sent to the online client to be processed through the blockchain. As long as your &#039;offline computer&#039; is fully quarantined and has never directly accessed the internet, it&#039;s impossible for your coins to be stolen.<br /><br />Even standard local wallets running under bitcoin qt could possibly be swiped if somehow a hacker manged to install some kind of keylogger, etc.<br /><br />For myself, I realize that I&#039;m being WAAAY over-cautious. Being over-cautious is fun :P<br /><br />Personally, I would never trust purely web-based wallets for long-term cold storage. They are strictly for &#039;play money&#039;

As long as your &#039;offline computer&#039; is fully quarantined and has never directly accessed the internet, it&#039;s impossible for your coins to be stolen.<br /><br />Even standard local wallets running under bitcoin qt could possibly be swiped if somehow a hacker manged to install some kind of keylogger, etc.<br /><br />For myself, I realize that I&#039;m being WAAAY over-cautious. Being over-cautious is fun :P<br /><br />Personally, I would never trust purely web-based wallets for long-term cold storage. They are strictly for &#039;play money&#039;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I like the cautious route too. I choose to view things from a perspective that usually includes worst case scenarios as wellas best case scenarios. Chance favors the prepared, right?<br /><br />Some see it as mindless paranoia but... I mean, by generally preparing, or at least making note of, a potential worst case scenario... I find myself being in better control of the overall situation, and intentionally reducing complexity of most situations in order to make dealing with it in the event of that scenario playing out that much easier.<br /><br />A lot of my friends have observed that this typically gives me something of a more intense OCD... and I tend to be an asshole when one of those scenarios ends up happening to them and they&#039;re unprepared. LIke one recently, friend had to bring his laptop in. For years I&#039;ve been telling him to separate the huge media files and his home directory, so he can just back up /home/user and keep the big junk on a separate external disk<br /><br />Can&#039;t imagine its hard to guess what happened :P

				Like your thinking Offbeatadam! <br /><br />Like my dad always said,<br /><br />&quot;Always hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s so easy so dismiss caution as paranoia and measured cynicism for negativity. Clearly they are very different in approach and application and merely look similar to the unprepared.<br /><br />Life&#039;s a game I&#039;m in to win....and I&#039;m a hardcore gamer :D
