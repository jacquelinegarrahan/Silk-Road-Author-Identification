				Shite?<br /><br />Never mind. <br />But he is right there is also deGaussing.<br />Wiping data with a magnet.<br /><br />See the hdd as a vcr tape.<br />Now,&nbsp; how would you wipe a movie from a vcr-tape?<br /><br />And how much time will it take, to wipe all the data from that tape, if the movie is 3 hours long.<br /><br />There is no way you can delete all the data from a movie of 3 hours in 5 minutes.<br />A movie on a vcr tape of 3 hours will be gone when you put another movie of three hours over the first movie.<br /><br />The same goes for the hdd.<br /><br />The hdd has e ceramic disc , but the old floppydisc looks more as the material where a vcr-tape is made from.<br />The heads to record are even more alike in a floppy and a vcr.<br /><br />Not only goes this for hdd&#039;s but for cd&#039;s or dvd&#039;s as well. Wiping will as it wore scratch a lot of bits and bytes from the cd or dvd as you would scratch with a knife. Needles to say that you will mis always many bits or bytes.<br /><br />Deleting just removes the pointer.<br />Use undelete and you have your data back.<br />The same goes for erase, then you use unerase.<br />After format you use unformat and you will have all your data back.<br /><br />It&#039;s a nice experiment for you to download O&amp;O recovery and use it on a picture that you have wiped with RSA 7 times.<br />You will see that a lot of the picture is gone, but there is still be left more then enough to see what was on the 7 times wiped picture.<br /><br />It was my job to wipe data from hdd&#039;s so the computers cold be sold again in the secondhand market.<br />Hospitals and local governments did only business with us.<br /><br />Other company&#039;s did use only the militairy rsa 7 times wiping method.<br />Result was that classified info came in the public domain.<br /><br />Rsa wiping is quick but leaves just to much data.<br />Y wll nt b bl t rd ll th dat tht as bn wpd, bu wth a ltj affr yu wi b abl t red wht data hs bn wpd.<br /><br />You may think that this is a load of shite, but it gave me a job for many years and all city counsels and hospitals went to us, after they had company&#039;s like fox-it ordered te recover the data we wiped.<br />All computers from all the hospitals and city-counsels had te be clean before the cold be sold again on the second hand market.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t care if you think that this is a load of shite.<br />The didn&#039;t.<br />It was my job for years to make sure that all data was wiped.<br />How many years do you have experience in wiping data?<br />And not just as a hobby !<br /><br />Easy to say &quot;&quot;a load of shit&quot;&quot; but tell me what you think.<br />Not what you know, because I already know you don&#039;t know but just think.<br /><br />I did nit write a load of shit.<br />You didn&#039;t either, but you are a load of shit.<br /><br />Do not say just &quot;&quot;a load of shit&quot;&quot; but tell how you think how it is, so I can proof you wrong!<br /><br />&nbsp;

DBAN is a program that you reboot the computer into, for example. If the host OS is running, then depending on the program, it may not write over the unallocated space (for example, running the command &quot;secure-delete C:&quot; won&#039;t write over the unallocated space). The article doesn&#039;t mention whether it was an online or offline program, but one interpretation is that he used a program running on the host OS, which only wrote over the allocated partitions/space, leaving the unallocated space untouched, even though he didn&#039;t cancel the job.<br /><br />In fact, he may have done a zero fill of the empty space, which would be the least secure.

				This is silly.<br /><br />Encrypt the entire disc with impossible 64 char password you don&#039;t ever use again<br />Install whatever operating system you want over top of it you&#039;ve basically effectively deleted everything because nothing can be recovered<br />

				Download a program free called datanuke, i think it may have been Dban that made it but i cant remember, <br />You may have to configure your bios to get it working, But have an operating system cd ready before you run it because it literally does NUKE your drive

I&#039;ve been advocating for FDE my whole time on the forum.<br /><br />However, a lot of people find themselves in the situation that they have done sensitive things on an unencrypted drive and need to securely erase that evidence. I advocate (at least) one random write using an offline tool like DBAN. 2 or 3 writes is ok too, but 7, 15 or 35 writes is overkill, in my opinion and the opinion of experts like NIST and CMRR. Of course, FDE should be mandatory afterwards.

				If you use linux (like Tails)&nbsp; there is a simple command you can use to overwrite your free space. I use this for flash drives but it will work on any drive. Make sure to delete unwanted files and the Recycle Bin (if there is one) first. Open terminal and navigate to a folder in the drive you wish to overwrite free space then:<br /><br />To fill your free space with zero&#039;s:<br />cat /dev/zero &gt; delete.this<br />rm delete.this<br /><br />To fill your free space with random:<br />cat /dev/urandom &gt; delete.this<br />rm delete.this<br /><br />The cat command will take a while and you may get an error at the end that your disk is full, which is good.

				You must always encrypt, forget about deleting. Modern file systems and drives do not let you delete anything, instead they &quot;helpfully&quot; move files for you around because they assume you don&#039;t want to actually delete. Journaling file systems, SSDs, nand flash (your cellphone), ect. <br /><br />Boot and Nuke is 1990s technology it won&#039;t do shit. Encrypt the entire drive first, then add stuff to it. If you fucked up, didn&#039;t encrypt your SSD and there&#039;s an insane amount of criminal evidence on it you use ATA Secure Erase and/or you use dcfldd http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Dcfldd then you physically destroy the drive and just invest the $80 for a new one. You don&#039;t throw the drive out in your trash where feds can pick it up you walk around the city and discreetly throw the pieces away and hope nobody is following you. Or toss it off a bridge into a river (but only after deleting). Or light it on fucking fire.<br /><br />The best way to learn about this, is simply pirate forensics guides. Especially smartphone guides, there&#039;s plenty of university written Android forensics .pdf books around where you can read all about the modern techniques they use.<br /><br />Also keep in mind this was freakin&#039; Bradley Manning, THE most wanted man in all of US intel agencies so sky was the limit as far as resources go to investigate his data (also, he didn&#039;t encrypt shit). For a typical drug dealing charge, cops are bound by how much money they can blow on a forensic investigation. If the drive is encrypted 99.99999% of the time they will simply stop there because it&#039;s too much money to pay some researcher at Carnegie Mellon $1,000/hr to deconstruct the drive and find information. If you&#039;re not a terrorist, Assange, Bradley Manning or whoever is running this site odds are this is never going to happen you&#039;ll just get state hick cops with a tiny budget. <br /><br />According to Bruce Schneier and basically every forensics industry blog that exists the vast majority of data they analyze is not encrypted. It&#039;s only recently where people have finally figured out to encrypt their shit using high entropy passwords, basically rendering forensics useless. So the strategy now is to simply change the laws so they can jail you forever in some countries for not giving your password. Because these laws are popping up in every country lately proves they can&#039;t do sweet fuck all when presented with a properly encrypted drive.**<br /><br />**unless they break into your place, and drop in bootloader rootkits. no problem because booting from encrypted root is easy now check openbsd -current softraid changes<br /><br />**unless you drop OPSEC so much they don&#039;t even need your data, like jeremy hammond<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
