				I sent some BTC&#039;s to a wallet and did not include the miner&#039;s fee. Somehow I lost the private key to the wallet I sent from.<br />When I checked the blockchain the transaction showed up but with 0 confirmations. I checked again today, and the transaction<br />was removed from the blockchain, as if it never existed! I assume the coins were sent back to the wallet they were sent from,<br />in which case I&#039;m at a loss since I lost the private key to that wallet. Any hope on the coins showing up in the destination wallet in the future?

I have never encountered this situation before. So is there no pending transaction on the destination wallet? If not then they might have been sent back to the source wallet. I will have to research how the bitcoin client handles these situations. Please keep us updated on this as I&#039;m very interested in it. Also best of luck on getting your coins.

				Just checked the blockchain and the coins showed up with 89 confirmations, albeit 2 days later.

Sadly some miners now are excluding 0 fee transactions from their blocks when they mine. I would recommend at least include a .005 BTC fee to guarantee quick confirmations.
