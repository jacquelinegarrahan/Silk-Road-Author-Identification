				I just canceled an order because the buyer wanted me to ship priority mail to &quot;Current Resident&quot; at an address.&nbsp; <br /><br />In my opinion, a priority/express envelope addressed to &quot;Current Resident,&quot; &quot;Postal Customer&quot; etc. is a big screaming red flag that THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS DRUGZ!!!!&nbsp; Between getting it intercepted and fingerprinted and getting called out as a &quot;Scammer&quot; when it doesn&#039;t arrive, I&#039;m not comfortable with the risk.&nbsp; It could be that I&#039;m being a nervous nellie and people regularly make these shipments with no trouble... but I&#039;d rather be a nervous nellie than bubba&#039;s bestest butt buddy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Any thoughts from those with more experience than I - which would include most vendors on SR Forum - would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!

				You are 100% in the right with this....<br /><br />If your auctions state that buyers need to use real names, not fake ones....then it is explained there.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mention that, you may want to....to cover future issues of this nature.<br /><br />Nobody send Priority Mail to &quot;current resident&quot;.&nbsp; You are completely in the right for canceling.

				Good call on not sending as directed!<br /><br />There isn&#039;t any sound reason (that I can think of) to not use your own name and address when ordering a package from SR...&nbsp; As long as the necessary precautions are taken, you still retain the aspect of plausible deniability even when using your real name.<br /><br />The most important aspect of shipping however, is making sure that the package blends in with other mail pieces by looking inconspicuous and by NOT RAISING ANY RED FLAGS that could draw unwanted attention to itself.&nbsp; The easiest way to get away with something you shouldn&#039;t be doing is to not get caught doing it in the first place.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of this responsibility falls on the vendor to use appropriate shipping methods.&nbsp; The rest falls on the buyer to provide a legitimate and valid name and address.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve since edited my profile to note that I only send priority, and that I do not send to &quot;Current Resident,&quot; &quot;Postal Customer,&quot; &quot;Barack Obama,&quot; etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As I said in another thread, if you treat your small Silk Road purchases like your small eBay purchases you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing unusual about receiving a package from a small vendor or a home business. There IS something unusual about getting your eBay purchases delivered to an abandoned building addressed to &quot;Rufus T. Firefly&quot; or &quot;Dirk Diggler.&quot;&nbsp; The idea is to avoid attention, not to behave like you have something to hide.
