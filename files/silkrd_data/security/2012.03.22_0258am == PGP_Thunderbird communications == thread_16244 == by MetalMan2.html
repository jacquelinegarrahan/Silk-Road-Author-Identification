				Just wanted to let everybody know about PGP (GnP) / Enigmail / Thunderbird was EASY to setup with Tormail.net.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been communicating with THE FLIPSIDE via this method and it is a hell of alot easier than encrypting a clipboard message and posting it via SR PM&#039;s.&nbsp; I highly suggest it!!!&nbsp; If you need details email me at metalman@tormail.net or hit me up here.

				As MetalMan suggested, communicating via GPG/Tormail is 100% secure, and pretty straight forward to set up and very easy to use.<br /><br />We highly recommend this thread for new GPG users.

				One thing to note with that guide (and the one on tormail&#039;s site) is that I found it didn&#039;t work as Socks v4 but is fine if you set it to v5. I have no idea whether this affects the security and I e-mailed the tormail admins about it but they haven&#039;t responded yet.<br /><br />/tinfoil hat time<br />I&#039;m also a little concerned by the fact that the password is limited to 25 characters. Normally I&#039;d consider that more than enough but you can&#039;t use special characters either. Seems odd to me especially considering how hyper cypherpunk tor things usually are.<br />And for the entire tinfoil catsuit: I recall recently reading something about tormail being run by the russian security services.<br /><br />

				Socks4 works fine for me and everyone I know. It may be an issue on your end.<br /><br />I have heard that Tormail has some &quot;Russian connections&quot; at least. Someone posted a link a while back. You would think if it were some International/Russian LE agency running it, they would cover themselves well. Russia just &quot;automatically&quot; seems kind of &quot;suspicious&quot; in my opinion. Some random &quot;off-shore&quot; country would make a better front. I intend to investigate further. <br /><br />Have you emailed the Tormail admins re: the password issue? 25 does seem a bit low, and the &quot;special characters&quot; issue has concerned me as well. If it were some Russian/International agency abusing (or not) Tor&#039;s vulnerabilities in &#039;Exit Nodes&#039; (or something like that. please correct me) to harvest IP&#039;s, I would think the password issue is most likely just a mistake they overlooked, no matter what the situation.<br /><br />Regardless if you are using GPG none of these issues should be of any concern. And all the more reason to rotate between &quot;off-camera&quot; public-wifi or otherwise anonymous hotspots. <br /><br />But I am curious about the &quot;Russian connections&quot; and password issue. Email names also must start with a letter and don&#039;t allow special characters either. A less &quot;tin-foily&quot; possibility would be that it was simply &quot;sub-par&quot; programmers that designed the &quot;character&quot; aspect of the code. Doesn&#039;t really sound like the work of proffessional LE IT techs to me. But what do I know? ;)<br /><br />Does anyone have any more information?<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew<br /><br /><br />
