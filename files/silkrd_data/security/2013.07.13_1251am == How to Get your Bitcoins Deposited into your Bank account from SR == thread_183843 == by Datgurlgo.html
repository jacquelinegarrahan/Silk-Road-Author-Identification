				No there is no direct withdrew method from SR to your bank account yet. I&#039;m sure DPR and the team are planning on implementing it in the near future though. Sounds like a really great idea and I have no clue why it was never a feature included in SR from the start?&nbsp; 8)

				What have you guys been smoking? I&#039;ve never heard of anything like that. How would SR anonymously deposit money into your bank account? Some vendors you can cash out BTC in various methods for various fees, but for serious weight you need a more advanced plan.
