				If you&#039;re confused now I&#039;d stay away from GnuPG for the time being. It&#039;s a command-line implementation of the OpenPGP standard and is mostly used as a back-end for a separate GUI front-end like Gnu Privacy Assistant (GPA) that gives you the familiar windows with a point-and-click interface. Their website is like going into a time-warp to the 1990&#039;s (most crypto people shun HTML), but the mathematical security is ironclad and only thing that really ever changes is the size of the keys you can generate.&nbsp; I think just about all the reputable email/message encryption software uses either GnuPG or GPGME (which is the library GPG4USB uses) as the back-end library for all cryptographic operations.<br /><br />Haha confused yet? Seriously, just make it easy on yourself -if you have Windows do like NC said and download GPG4USB. I use it on my Win machine now and only wish I could run it on the linux distro I have, although Kgpg is a not too distant second place to it. There is no other OpenPGP crypto program out there on any OS (that I&#039;m aware of) that&#039;s as simple and hassle-free to use as GPG4USB.<br /><br />Unfortunately PGP encryption has not successfully migrated very far from its computer-nerd core and this is reflected in the shameful paucity of user-friendly implementations. After all, the enourmous bulk of the technological and security aspects of it are already there for free from GnuPG, yet it is still shrouded in arcane terminology. The GPG backends are already ubiquitous and begging for a front-end face lift so it can become popular with the masses. Imagine that huh - 95% of internet data packets being totally encrypted so the government snoops become as withered and useless as the Maytag repairman from the old TV commercials.<br /><br />Heh, I&#039;m spun and babbling&nbsp; :P Just get GPG4USB. Even if you&#039;re confused by it at first, I promise you&#039;re not gonna find anything out there that&#039;s less confusing.
