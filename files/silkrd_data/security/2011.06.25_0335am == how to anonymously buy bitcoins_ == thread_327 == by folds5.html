				Ok so I email a few of the companies that claim to be able to take cash in the mail for bit coin payments, almost none of them got back to me with the exception of Nanaimo Gold who said “Sorry, I no longer accept cash by mail for bitcoin.”&nbsp; They also said in the email “I suggest you find an exchanger close to home (unless you are in the USA)” so that made me feel unsafe about the whole thing. <br /><br />i used this list - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins - &quot;Small amounts&quot;<br /><br />When you send money with western union they make you show government officially issued identification card so I don’t want to you that way to buy bit coins.<br /><br />When you go into any bank you are on film in many different angles, and if you are depositing into a shady account you will be marked in some sort of way.<br /><br /><br />So my question is, how can I get 3 bitcoins with out is being instantly traced back to me,&nbsp; I understand the ewallet / tumbler / escrow&nbsp; keep it moving around so you will not be able to prove where your money went, but how can I not have it linked to me from the very beginning. How can I make it so they can’t prove I ever had any bit coin in the first place? <br /><br />i read this - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity - and will do that after i find a way to buy them <br /><br />If you did not guess, I am completely new to this. <br /><br />Thank you

				I too would like to know how to buy btc in cash. My understanding was that it really didnt matter if you bought coins in the clear, cause once you tumbled them it was pretty much washed. Unless you&#039;re worried about ending up on a list for buying them.

				I guess I am paranoid of being added to some list for buy bit coins. The bit coins that I bought linked to either my federal issued identification card or my bank account and then having those bit coins that are very provable that I bought, being transferred to this site. This suggests that I use this site and that I have purchased things off this site.&nbsp; This is illegal in at least the country / state that I live in. <br /><br />That is what I am thinking about and is the only reason I have not bought anything on this site so far. <br /><br />Its one thing to go and buy something in cash (If you get caught in the act you are fucked, but otherwise you are pretty safe and untraceable), but if you are electronically linked to buying something it can be proved forever.<br /><br />This is why I was interested in the whole “mail us cash to buy bit coins” idea, but it seems like you cannot do that anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just because you&#039;re paranoid. Doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not after you - kurt cobain<br />

				The dollar value of bitcoins is too unstable to make sending cash in the mail workable. Also, would you really trust the person to send you the coins? <br /><br />There are some ways of getting btc by cash but you have to go through several &quot;currencies&quot; so you will lose money on transaction fees. Check this site: http://magnetic-money.org/ you could get a pre-paid debit card and go from there

				If you are willing to pay some high fees you can buy bitcoins anonymously from bitcoinexchange.cc. You can&nbsp; go to Wallmart or CVS and buy a moneypak refill card with cash (no ID required). Then use tor to access the website and setup your order.&nbsp; Since you get the bitcoins the same day this eliminates the problem of the bitcoin price changing after you mail cash. But the moneypak refill card costs $5 and the bitcoin exchanger charges %7 fee. Still this may be the most anonymous way to buy small amounts of bitcoin in the US.

				There is a cost to transact anonymously.&nbsp; For me it is between 5 and 18% depending on exchange rates.&nbsp; I end up exchanging 5 different types of currency and accounts before my cash ends up as a bitcoin.
