				Here is an interesting email conversation between the author of OpenBSD and an former FBI employee.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">List:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;openbsd-tech<br />Subject:&nbsp; &nbsp; Allegations regarding OpenBSD IPSEC<br />From:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theo de Raadt &lt;deraadt () cvs !

Now I know why the author of this guide is more interested in Gentoo recently.&nbsp; ::)

				As the dates on the emails indicate, this is old news.&nbsp; It did cause a bit of a stir when it was released, though.<br /><br />From memory an audit was done following the release of that information which showed that there was no backdoor and that the code that had been submitted to the project to insert the backdoor either never made it to a production release or didn&#039;t last long enough to be included in any release of the last few years (that&#039;s the part I can&#039;t remember).&nbsp; Since OpenBSD is an open source project this is all verifiable.<br />

				As far as I can tell, the whole &quot;ultra-super-security&quot; of OpenBSD mainly stems from them auditing the code of the base system. This means that in theory a clean OpenBSD installation is entirely secure, but as soon as you start adding things like web servers or graphical desktops you&#039;re exposing yourself to all the potential security flaws within. I mean, it&#039;s great that they take so much effort with the base system, all OS projects should make sure they have a secure core, but personally I&#039;m a FreeBSD girl. Well, that or GNU/Linux.
