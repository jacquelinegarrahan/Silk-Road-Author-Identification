				Hey everyone! :) Being new to this forum but not new to forums I know that newbies can be pain in the *ss but I swear I literally heard of the SR 12 hours ago and since then I also heard of bit-coins and god knows what else for the first time! :-[ I have worked diligently to work all of this through on my own but I am concerned that in the last few laps I could really mess a few things up!? I do have my bitcoins though!&nbsp; 8) ;D<br /><br />My situation... my main notebook computer is new, sh*t hot fast, and incredibly reliable! That was until 3 days ago my CPU fried into the motherboard and, well I&#039;m back to using my not so reliable or fast 5 year old notebook that often has a mind of its own.<br /><br />My question, generally... I downloaded &quot;bitcoin wallet&quot; and it seems to take a VERY long time &quot;synchronizing with the network...&quot; As this process takes so long, and I feel my notebook is fairly unreliable,&nbsp; I wonder if an online based wallet would be a good way to start and make a one time purchase?<br /><br />Specific questions...<br /><br />1. Is this &quot;synchronizing with the network...&quot; a one time deal and it will work more quickly in the future? Should I wait it out with &quot;bitcoin wallet&quot;?<br />2. Could someone refer me to a reliable online wallet, at least for one quick transaction?<br /><br />and, not immediately important but... <br /><br />3. Do all online wallets use encryption? <br />4. Do all sellers require encryption? <br /><br />I am sorry for doing the new guy questionnaire right up top but I am working hard to do this on my own and now concerned that as I now have some bit-coins, I don&#039;t want them to go walkabout when my computer freezes, as it is want to do 3 times a day! I&#039;m at my wits end but still in the game! :&#039;(&nbsp; All the best fellow travelers and sincere thanks!!&nbsp; ;D

				WOW!! Thanks for such a quick reply! I feel like I am cramming for my bitcoin-SR final and the clock is ticking...<br /><br />Do you think an online wallet is a worse idea than a faster more reliable computer based one? As I said. I am doing a one time deal to give it a try and I can regroup later if I stay on the SR full time!<br /><br />I wont hold advisers accountable for my experiences if they go a muck.<br /><br />Thanks again!!

				Once you check out blockchain, you&#039;re worries will go i think.<br />Just to be sure, as soon as you&#039;re funds get sent there, send them straight onto here.<br />Unless you&#039;re doing more than just using BTC for SR, thats another matter.<br />

				YOU ROCK!!<br /><br />OK, now I am am pushing with one last question to end my day on the SR...<br /><br />I want to finalize this order early tomorrow... Do you think it is unwise to have those funds sit there over night? Again, I know this is my responsibility!

Regularly back this up, encrypt the backup, and email it to yourself.<br />Personally I would never leave coins in an online Instawallet as they have been known to shut down out of the blue and keep everybody&#039;s coins.<br />This is highly unlikely with blockchain.info as it&#039;s pretty much an &#039;unofficial, official&#039; Bitcoin site/project, but still, would you give a guy that you&#039;d just met on the street all of your money and ask him to mind it for you until you&#039;re ready to spend it?<br /><br />As you&#039;ve just installed it, the original client has to download the entire blockchain to your computer, and this will take some time as the blockchain is quite large at present, and increasing in length (and so, size) all the time. &quot;Synchronizing with network&quot; means that the client is downloading the blockchain, and though it may seem slow, leave it overnight and (depending on your internet connection speed) it should be done by the morning. Open the client regularly in order to let it download the blocks that have been mined since the last time you ran it and it&#039;ll catch up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />As for your encryption questions, no, online wallets aren&#039;t encrypted as such, and yes, most sellers here require you to send your personal details (name, address) encrypted when placing an order. Some will accept Privnote but this is generally viewed as completely insecure.<br />It takes a very short amount of time to learn how to use PGP, and the safety benefits from doing so are impossible to quantify.<br /><br />&quot;pine&quot; very kindly runs the PGP Club to help new users out with this; you&#039;ll find it here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.0<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I recently had a computer crash and didn&#039;t have two days to wait for the blockchain download so I tried Multibit (Clearnet: Multibit.org) and I like it so far, its fast and it supports multiple wallets if I want to spread my bitcoin around.&nbsp;
