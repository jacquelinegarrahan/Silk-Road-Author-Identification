				I&#039;ve just had an extremely unamicable split with my partner of six years. She&#039;s very bitter, has cut a load of my clothes up, and has already been down the police station telling them things about me.

				I do remember some students at a university were able to crack some truecrypt encryption method.. but I would not worry about that. Just use truecrypt how the program explains itself.<br /><br />About people informing the police about somebody: if it&#039;s just her then they probably think she is very annoying since they can&#039;t do anything anyway with information of one person. Or think she&#039;s a borderliner ;)<br /><br />But it&#039;s always good to encrypt your stuff (and remember the password later on or else you will have lost all your data...).<br /><br />Good luck.

				First and foremost: I have to agree with the above. If this is time sensitive, you need to place that laptop somewhere far away.<br /><br />If not, do you know where sensitive information is stored on your computer?&nbsp; E.G. the folders? If so, save time and download Eraser or Bleachbit.&nbsp; Run it on these folders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Truecrypt can&#039;t be cracked as of now by virtue of the algorithms not being able to be cracked. Furthermore, if you make a secret partition, they can&#039;t tell which is the real one.<br /><br />Note, if you aren&#039;t already truecrypted, you can&#039;t really do it now as all your data will be deleted with the formatting I believe.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are a vendor, I recommend physically relocating the device somewhere with DBAN to run overnight. When it is done, it is safe.

				Might want to get a new hard drive and install/encrypt that. Make it bigger than the one you&#039;ve already got and consider it an upgrade to get more space. After she cools down you won&#039;t need to have worry about anything occurring with your laptop, you&#039;ll be more security conscious, and you&#039;ll have a bigger hard drive.

				Te rumors that TryeCrupt can be cracked are not true.<br /><br />A TC volumes unencrypted key will be stored in RAM as long as the volume is mounted. This is mentioned in the TrueCrypt documentation: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/unencrypted-data-in-ram<br /><br />It is possible to dump the content of RAM, or use a DMA (direct memory access. Exposed via ie: fw or thunderbold port) hack to extract the key (or even freeze the computer and physical move the RAM chips to another computer as the chips keep their state for a few seconds after begin disconnected from power if below a certain point).<br /><br />However, all these methods require physical access to the machine, and that the volume is already mounted when they get it.<br /><br />If you unmount you volumes whenever you leave the machine you should be safe. The true crypt file format is basically nothing but random noise and has no no other known attack vector than brute force.<br /><br />In conclusion: Use good long passwords and unmount your volumes whenever they are not in use and you should be safe enough.<br /><br />

				The only near 100% true way to erase all the data is to have it replaced with other data. Even using a program like Dban doesn&#039;t mean everything will be wiped clean.. even says that on there site. Still Dban is a great choice and it&#039;s free. There&#039;s a paid service and I believe it&#039;s linked on the DBAN site that says it&#039;s 100% foolproof.<br /><br />If it were me I&#039;d probably use Dban to wipe, reinstall the OS and do it a couple of more times for good measure. Go through the registry files, system files and things like that to trace any left over information. Windows is notorious for leaving all kinds of junk and evidence on your computer even after wiping or uninstalling files and programs. Other option you could use DBAN and if you were using windows install a Linux suite like Ubuntu which should theoretically overwrite any left over window files or registry files.

You do not trust anyone with anything relating to the underground world. Girlfriend or wife, closest friend or brother, they will all sell you out for the right price. But who could blame them? It is easy to say you would not say anything when you are NOT staring down the barrel of 10+ years. Many people have no idea what this is like - one who has not been through it could only imagine the mental insanity one goes through. You need to make these decisions for your loved ones before they get you into trouble. No human being should be trusted with your life or freedom. You can only trust yourself, because you are the only one who truly gives a damn about yourself at the end of the day. Never trust a man because he says he loves you, and certainly never trust a woman just because she fucks you and keeps you company. Plenty of people have had issues with their own mothers selling them out (myself included). Most women are weak snakes. Most men are snakes in dog costumes. Look out for yourself, friend. In this world, if you cannot do that, you simply cannot be free.

				This thread is rife with misinformation about TrueCrypt.<br /><br />1 - Yes, you CAN use TrueCrypt on a drive with information already on it, TC will securely Guttmann wipe the original data and then encrypt it. It just takes 50 times longer than if the drive was empty.<br /><br />2 - Yes, TrueCrypt CAN be cracked with a program that is freely downloadable from TPB, if you use a short easy to remember password for TrueCrypt it can be Brute Force cracked in no time at all, by one CPU, let alone a cloud service of hundreds of thousands of CPUs that LE undoubtedly have access to. The longer your passphrase, the longer it takes to be cracked by any amount of hardware.<br /><br />LE can also disect your Windows hibernation file for TrueCrypt header algorithm keys which can give them access, so if your computer has hibernated while you have a TrueCrypt volume mounted, i&#039;d suggest you liquify your HDD/SDD with a blowtorch, buy a new one and not use any Windows Hibernation in the future.<br /><br />Really, I will suggest that nobody uses any form of Microsoft products ever again (did you hear that Bill?). XBOX included. Windows OS especially. Go with Tails, it doesn&#039;t track your movements or leave footprints &amp; it fits on a thumb drive.

				Don&#039;t worry about it. The chances of your computer being seized based on the questionable testimony of an emotional ex are pretty slim. If you&#039;re really worried just park the laptop somewhere else for a while &amp; pick up a used one to pass off as your own. <br /><br />If you do get a visit, just stay cool &amp; you&#039;ll be fine. She&#039;s going to come off like the unhinged vindictive gf while your only crime will be having put up with her for so long.&nbsp; Just explain that she&#039;s a pathological liar &amp; that she&#039;s taking the breakup a little hard. Then show them some of your sliced up clothes &amp; ask them whether they&#039;d advise a restraining order -&nbsp; or (even better) just tell them she&#039;s got a drug habit &amp; she&#039;s been using your machine to order shit in your name &amp; that&#039;s the reason you broke up. ;)&nbsp; <br />

				The police have better things to do than take the side of some pissed off ex-girlfriend. Let her inform away, it&#039;s not credible unless she has some kind of evidence. She better be careful too, because if you have been doing illegal shit and she ignored it then she is just implicating herself in the whole mess by ratting you out. Idiot is going to get herself thrown in jail right along with you, if she manages to even get their attention.

				Thankfully nobody has come yet but she&#039;s still trying to mess me about big time.<br /><br />If I did a DBAN wipe of the HDD before chucking it and upgraded to a bigger drive would this be OK?
