				With all the complications lately as far as obtaining bitcoins anonymously I was wondering if I could just use girlfriends to buy my coins for me the legit way (providing id all that dumb shit.). Is this a good idea esp, if I get my coins tumbled and such before I have em sent to my SR?

				If everything went the way you planned I think thats a damn good way to do it. All theyre doing is buying the coins, then just tumbling them and eventually they end up in your wallet. Completely 100% not related to you! But just as sourman said, only you&#039;ll know if they are trustworthy

				What would that achieve compared to you buying bitcoins the legit way? I guess if you don&#039;t live together and you place is full of drugs and hers is clean it makes sense, but otherwise you&#039;re just taking your risk and placing it on her. <br /><br />You also have to trust her to be able to effectively handle inquiry (aka don&#039;t talk to police, or anyone for that matter).<br /><br />

				I have no concerns. Most women I deal with are not computer literate and have no desire to utilize anything but social media. If I ask them to make important purchases on my behalf I&#039;m fairly confident that they wouldn&#039;t even know what the hell they were buying for me and really all they need to know is that its totally legal for them to buy bitcoins for me in the first place. And yes any chick I deal with is trained on how to deal with po po. Don&#039;t tell em shit, if you&#039;re gonna lock me up lock me up and get my lawyer. Period. Outside of the dating and sex (which I do anyhow for fun), there&#039;s no monetary compensation for them (at least if you fuck em well enough ;) ). When do you think a person would be investigated as far as bitcoins are concerned? 5 grand in a month? 10 grand? I just need to know at which point I would be making one girl too hot and then utilize the next one. Any ideas or suggestions?
