How can I write the code that will allow me to do this on a website&gt; Like say I want to sell all these widgets and I want to accept bitcoins, but I don&#039;t feel like fucking with going to mt cocks, seeing the rate and doing calculations, then emailing the sucker (I mean customer) telling him how many coins to send, before the rate changes and I have to start all over again?<br /><br />Is this even possible?<br /><br />Meister, I think I responded to another one of you rposts about how to apply vpn and tor together, so if you getta chance, if its not askin too much, can you tell me about that too? I feel like pickin brains today.<br /><br />NM

				Sorry for the late response but it looks like your in good hands.<br />As far as difficulty goes it depends on the API and your skill level with the implementing language.<br />Looking over the MtGox API, it looks relativly straight forward.&nbsp; You can even implement it JS.&nbsp; The best thing to do would be to read over the API and dive in.&nbsp; Diving into a language is the best way to learn it, in my humble opinion.&nbsp; Good luck!
