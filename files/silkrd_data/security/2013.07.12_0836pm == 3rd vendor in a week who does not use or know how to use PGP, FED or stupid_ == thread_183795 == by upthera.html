				Am I wrong to think this is way fucked up. I don&#039;t know who is worse, the people buying from these vendors or the guy with 500 quid and zero brains who comes here with/out a PGP key or even Privnote(I wouldn&#039;t use it but at least he would be trying.&nbsp; this is from the most recent one.&nbsp; So, LE or just stupid?&nbsp; honestly, just want to hear opinions.<br /><br />Snip from SR, Edited for privacy until vendor tells me why, will post name if no good explanation or fast change.&nbsp; What is going on with this place. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello.<br />been dying to make a purchase and didn&#039;t want to bother you as I fugured it would be up or at least mentioned but where is your PGP key or email so I can look for it on a keyserver.

				OMFG!!!&nbsp; Listen to this response from &quot;Keep Em Bouncing&quot; when I asked about lack of PGP key because I wanted to place an order.&nbsp; Raise bond to 5000K + or something.&nbsp; AVOID THESE PEOPLE LIKE EHR PLAUGE.

SEC folks, am I out of line?<br /><br />#######################<br /><br />Keep Em Bouncin(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yeah? everyone else who uses this site sends their addresses in its proper box. your suppose to type your address in that box when you check out, the box is right above here you type your pin number in to confirm the purchase. not everyone PGP&#039;s their addresses. each address is destroyed after I place it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 seconds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread&nbsp; &nbsp; delete<br /><br />###########################<br /><br />not posting this with anything but concern for SR community. I don&#039;t know vendor, just like to give new vendors a chance but after that comment my jaw is on the ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />EDIT: mis spelled &quot;vendors&quot; name&nbsp; &quot;Keep Em Bouncin&quot;

				Him not wanting to use PGP does not make him a Fed.... If a Fed did try to make a vendor account, whether or not they use PGP when receiving your address would not be the make or break point for admissable vs inadmissable evidence. If your address is encrypted and the &#039;Fed&#039; has the key to decrypt it successfully, then it can still be easily used as evidence.<br /><br />PGP only protects you in cases where a vendors account is hacked(by a Fed presumably) or if a vendor is compromised in the real world and they gain access to his SR account yet he refuses to provide decryption information. A vendor not wanting to use PGP is their own choice, but it&#039;s not very smart in the first place.<br /><br />Edit: I wanted to add, there are a number of people, including myself, who have made bulk orders numerous times without using PGP....It won&#039;t kill you to not use it once or twice, but it&#039;s always smart to take the extra step for security.&nbsp;

				Yeah, about 20% of vendors don&#039;t have PGP keys, and a majority of buyers don&#039;t encrypt their addresses.<br /><br />Some vendors are pretty explicit about not using PGP. Here&#039;s what RxKing&#039;s profile says:<br /><br />PGP:<br />If you want to use pgp...go to another vendor. If SR ever gets compromised they will want ME--NOT YOU!! And they sure as fuck won&#039;t look at orders and find your address and do something. I don&#039;t have the space to get into it...but it is the biggest myth on SR. I have heard so many lame reasons. But they all love to say it is an added layer of security. Total bullshit...but whatever...NO PGP FOR THE KING<br /><br />He also says:<br /><br />Privnote---<br />If you must be secretive(no need at all) with sending me your address and you believe all those morons in the forum ---- I ONLY USE privnote.com. You can use it for your address. Part of the reason my operation runs so fast is because I don&#039;t have to waste extra time trying to read secretive messages or use that stupid time wasting pgp. Don&#039;t be the one slowing the packaging and shipping down with your privnote last second after my time cut off time with a long message for me to read and respond to. I am very busy!<br /><br />Privnote is safe, fast, and easy. And totally not needed. BUT if you feel you need to..then use it. I don&#039;t care. But don&#039;t use it to send me a question..A big waste of time. You are too paranoid and stupid... Go to another vendor or jump off a building.<br /><br />

Might be safe but not the right tool for SR.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback .&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure this vendor has no clue how to use PGP/GPG by his comments but not my problem.&nbsp; I did offer to teach him though with no strings attatched but I&#039;m done with idiots like that willing to make a dangerous game even riskier.&nbsp; I work in a very very dangerous ocupation and I know you can never eliminate risk but that is not an excuse to not take every reasonable precaution in your power to stay alive. of in this case out of prison.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				^^^ I do the same thing i like catching new vendors, found a few really good ones that way.<br />but it can also be very nerveracking because there is no history or anything to go on. <br />the one&#039;s ive caught just starting out always used pgp tho. otherwise i wouldnt have ordered.<br />make&#039;s me feel safer. if you can get a little piece of mind on this black market, why not?<br />since reading this thread i have noticed more vendors not using it. for me i like it and dont see why <br />someone wouldnt use it. really it&#039;s not time consuming at all so i never understood why not.<br />for regular messages i wouldnt use it only for sensitive info like addy or track,etc. just my 2 cents<br />happy roading friend

				Love the mention of using scripts as how much it tears apart the arguments that it takes TOO much time and effort like that of &quot;RxQueen&quot;.<br /><br />of course I seriously doubt that if these fools cant figure out how to encrypt their emails and other correspondence using PGP then they most likely will not be writing many scripts. To be fair, a vendor like Keep Em Bouncin probably does not know what a shell script is. Thats ok, we are not all experts, I sure as hell am not, but his and others recklessless attitudes are not.<br /><br />&nbsp; Great example about the shipping optimization that I believe some employ and many more should start.&nbsp; <br /><br />+1 for the lot of ya<br /><br />&nbsp;

				This sucks badly. I think some people get into the trade becasue they think that they can be arrogant, boss people around, etc. IRL, it&#039;s a lot of work and doesnn&#039;t pay as much as some people think. I was in San Quentin one time (I&#039;m somebody who thinks ending up in a penetitionary is a mark of stupidity rather than a bona fide) talking to this guy who got a long sentence. He was a cool guy, and said for the amount of work he put into his drug business, he could have made just as much money working at a regular job. I never forgot that)<br />Another creepy thing is while reading a lot of non fiction books about drugs (both by LE and users/dealers) that LE consistintcy acts arrogantly in order to get around rules that are set up in order to keep LE at bay. There was this one dude in a biker gang who got in with the Feds and he was taking pictures and movies of his biker buddies doing all kinds of illegal stuff. They thought nothing of it, because he was a member and was &#039;cool&#039; (in reality he had a lot of balls, true) In fact when the feds &#039;rolled up&#039; the whole conspiracy of people (another creepy thing in this day and age is that investigations can easily run over a year-how much money must that cost? Absolutely not hindered by money, the Feds) his biker friends absolutely refused to believe that he had &#039;turned&#039;-from being a biker gang member to a biker gang member who will be testifying against them soon. It was kind of funny and kind of sad that was expressed in their initial disbelief of this guy&#039;s betrayal. The Feds of course can break any law in the book, do it openly, and still not pay a price (not these days-used to be the &#039;poisoned tree&#039; of evidence from illegal activities, that&#039;s gone now (just read some recent newspaper articles) and not only can they not have to pay a price, they can enable ANYBODY who &#039;makes them happy&#039; to not &#039;pay a price&#039; too. Read about &#039;Whitey Bulger&#039; and John Gotti if you don&#039;t think you can be excused from MURDER if you make the Fed&#039;s &#039;happy&#039;. With that kind of leverage who can say if they&#039;d turn or not? The Feds are like the modern day Gestapo, jack booted thugs. Of course now it&#039;s for CP (although I have nothing but contempt for CP and their users) and &#039;terroism&#039;) not for the average SR user. Surely they wouldn&#039;t spend all their time and money on &#039;drug users&#039;, right/sarcasm. <br />The rules at SR are to help both parties to the deal happy (and &#039;safe&#039;-whatever that means in this day and age)<br />Anyway (in another story of Feds skirting rules), another guy (who was LE) quickly established his bona fides with organized crime by just buying a lot of dope, quickly. I mean, he started buying an ounce of blow, then in two weeks (or in a damm short time) he&#039;s buying mulitple pounds. He is telling the gangters, &#039;Fuck you, I&#039;ll go somewhere else to buy the drugs, if we don&#039;t do this deal&#039; Of course you know how that turned out too. <br />I&#039;m most hopeful in that with encryption and some work you can make yourself pretty anonymous, but it&#039;s obviously not just buy using Tor. The LE will &#039;weed&#039; out the people who take shortcuts (although plain ole luck plays a part of course) and improve the breed. Make sure you&#039;re not the guy getting the &#039;Darwin award&#039; by taking yourself out of the &#039;gene&#039; pool. <br />Anybody who hasn&#039;t read the recent articles of NSAtoDEA info going to local police and the organized plan to provide &#039;alternate&#039; explanations of probable cause (or hasn&#039;t seen Judge Napoleano on Fox explain how the 4th amendment has been completely eliminated, &#039;fait accompli&#039; might be surprised too<br />It&#039;s not a question of politics (tho most here are IMO, libertarians) and &#039;whose&#039; to blame for this structure which is steadily eliminating the bill of rights in US (and which many others in different countries never had) Every government is in on the &#039;game&#039;. <br />Interesting times. Same symbol in Chinese as danger also means oppurtunity.

				If you wont use PGP, at least use anon drops. <br />I feel secure using addy&#039;s not linked to me in any way because even if SR/PGP was compromised or LE got your address somehow, it wont be traced back to you. <br /><br />There are plenty of PGP threads and tutorials, both on SRF and clearnet.

				I have a few questions about this topic since on the last order I had problems with pgp:<br /><br />It was my 6th order on SR and I did the same steps as any other order that worked well, but this time the vendor continued to say that he couldn&#039;t read the pgp message. This went on for 5 tries, and on the 5th I used a tool for pgp on a website, so that I was sure that whatever was wrong with my methods or pc could be bypassed. That worked, but in the meantime I began to wonder why the hell it didn&#039;t work this time, and the vendor continued to suggest using privnote. <br />So, the question is, could it be possible that it was a fault with the vendor&#039;s software (maybe not updated? or he doesn&#039;t know how to use it? ) or was it just me having big time problems? <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=183795.msg1333416#msg1333416">Quote from: astor on July 12, 2013, 10:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />You only need to fuck up once to get screwed.

What&#039;s stopping DPR or each vendor for writing down 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.? That doesn&#039;t mean the White House ordered drugs just because their address is there.

				And then we have...<br /><br />Buyers who don&#039;t encrypt. Way more than 50% do not encrypt at all. I&#039;d say about 25% to 33% use encryption. Figure varies from week to week. We&#039;ve seen an uptick in encryption use this week. Likely because of the Tormail/Freedom hosting mess. <br /><br />I can&#039;t knock a vendor who doesn&#039;t use any encryption simply because most buyers don&#039;t use it either. So you can say it&#039;s a match made in bizarro-heaven.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of server side encryption like on Atlantis. <br /><br />We provide buyers with a strong 4096bit RSA key. <br /><br />So I guess the thing to say is if you require encryption, don&#039;t use vendors who don&#039;t. Don&#039;t even be tempted by price. StExo will be coming out with a name &amp; shame audit of vendors who use weak (&lt;2048bit key) to no encryption. Not sure what impact it will have other than to make enemies and maybe a few converts. But let that list be your guide.

As I interpreted the vendor contract, <br />vendors were required to use PGP. The party I was having the argument with said otherwise. DPR&nbsp; waded-in and stated that the use of PGP by vendors <br />was entirely optional, and that customers could choose not to do business with a vendor if they refused to use PGP. <br /><br />That is where it stands currently, as far as I am aware. Therefore, unless and until DPR changes this policy, PGP will never be a requirement on Silk Road. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

You literally have absolutely no idea what you&#039;re talking about</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />hahahah dude if your a vendor, Ill bet money I have placed more orders than you made sales, i&#039;ve been here over 2 years making purchases, you show me someone with a track record that long and maybe you wont be retarded<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah. I had about 140 transactions on my old account, and while you have placed 190+ orders, I&#039;ve spent your entire accumulated amount as a buyer on Silk Road in less than a month. Multiply your total amount spent by about 5, in a little more than a year and a half, learn encryption and the concept of humility and get back to me. Also, I find that people who go around bragging about their buyer stats and are stupid enough to post them on the forum actually have the shittiest buyer stats. The big players like to be discrete. So... Your orders on average are about $28 USD a piece given your buyer stats. So yeah. You&#039;re fucking Tony Montana incarnate. <br /><br />Lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />dude just stop, you werent here back in 2011, unless you arent located in US.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Ill end this so as not to embarrass you.&nbsp; Im in debt and broke, maybe your rich, i dont know,&nbsp; re-read my statement, you havent been on SR&nbsp; as long as me, nor placed as many orders.&nbsp; Lets say you did place 140, thats half the number I placed, and you havent been a member longer than 8 months maximum.&nbsp; Are your orders HUGE?&nbsp; could be.&nbsp; Are many pathetically small, YES.&nbsp; probably around $28.00 each.&nbsp; So im guessing your not debating my original statement?&nbsp; <br /><br />(this wasnt clear to you in our private conversation?&nbsp; if u didnt get it ill repeat, all you have is waaaay more posts on the forum as me) <br />&nbsp;and perhaps much more money spent.&nbsp; Now go back and read what I originally said.&nbsp; I wont even insult you,&nbsp; &nbsp;because I don&#039;t wanna drive up &quot;drama&quot; on the forums.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;now there are people who have been here when I first joined, but not you,&nbsp; I dont know how you can debate that.&nbsp; &nbsp;its not bragging, its just stating, you spend a lot of money, but dont know what your saying.&nbsp; <br />Im broke and and beg long time vendors to cut their prices by 5 bucks so i can place an order.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />You can (and will respond will sunglasses) but Ill just end it because theres nothing to argue about.&nbsp; <br /><br />(dont worry I wont embarrass you by posting our private conversation, where you didnt mention this ancient account)
