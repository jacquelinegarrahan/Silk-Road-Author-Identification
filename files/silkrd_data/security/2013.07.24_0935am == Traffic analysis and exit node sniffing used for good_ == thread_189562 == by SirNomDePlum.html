				I was just wondering if traffic analysis and exit node sniffing could ever be used for good?<br /><br />A big what if ... <br /><br />What if SR had a secret team of &quot;trusted insiders&quot; that monitored exit nodes for the benefit of SR and the revolutionary people&#039;s community as a whole? <br /><br />The analyzed data could be used to further the cause and help to protect our way of life.<br /><br />Should SR implement their own &quot;studies&quot; on exit nodes and other various security issues so that, they too, can reap the benefits of new information?<br /><br />The only way to know how to protect our information is by knowing the ways in which it can be stolen. Thus, communities should have a wide range of discussions on what all ways a HACKER can get his hands on our information and in what all ways you can thwart him. Not just discussions but studies as well.<br /><br />Thoughts? <br /><br />

				How would exit node sniffing help SR, when it&#039;s a hidden service that doesn&#039;t involve exit nodes?<br /><br />Perhaps studying fingerprinting attacks at entry nodes, or brute forcing hidden service directories, might help SR and its users, but I don&#039;t understand how your suggestion would be helpful.<br />

				could intercept government communications maybe. Several years ago a hacker monitoring Tor exit nodes intercepted hundreds of different government communications as well as gained access to dozens of government E-mail accounts and similar.
