				A 2000 Nokia is most likely Analog and not compatible with the current Digital cell system.<br /><br />It only costs $10 - 30$ for a new prepaid throwaway though.<br />

				wowow careful here. The imei number of the handset is still going to remain the same even if you change the sim. this is not good since every transmission broadcasts your imei. Also the phone will not be analogue. Analogue phones went a long time ago and networks wont even support them. I THINK. But do not keep that phone!

				words of wisdom for throw away.<br /><br />1) --most important-- they are called throw away for a reason. <br />2) re-read #1<br />3) throw them away constantly. NEVER IN YOUR OWN GARBAGE.<br />4) if possible before throwing away delete everything. then destroy the phone as best as possible. <br />5) needless to say, remove the sim and dispose of it separately. <br />6) don&#039;t just change sims<br />7) purchase with cash from different locations. <br />8) assume that they are still not safe, the more you use it, the longer you have it the greater the chances of someone linking it directly to you. (of course this is if they have an interest in you)<br />9) be paranoid. just be paranoid.
