				On the ZIPZAP payment slip it says please take to a moneygram location and use the express billpay.. I&#039;ve dont it a few times and always used cash. However, I am trying to buy more BTC then i can withdraw in one day at an ATM and my banks closest physical location is a few states away.. Can i use a debit card at walmart instead of cash whilst still getting the speedy Xfer via bitinstant to blockchain? (buying bitcoins is legal so anonymity at wal mart w/ debit card shouldn&#039;t matter, Correct?)<br /><br />Thanks In Advance Travelers&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t see why not.&nbsp; I would assume that as long as they get their money, they don&#039;t care how it comes.&nbsp; We are moving towards a cashless society anyways, so I think you should be ok..&nbsp; But check with the retailer beforehand to confirm.
