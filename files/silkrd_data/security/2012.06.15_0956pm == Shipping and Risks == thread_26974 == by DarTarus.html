				I&#039;m relatively new here so this has probably been covered elsewhere but, for now, I can&#039;t see where&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve made several orders on SR and so far everything has hummed along nicely.<br /><br />I have been thinking about the entire shipping process and where the highest amount of risk lies.<br /><br />It would seem that some products are inherently safer to mail than others (LSD for example is small, flat and is harder for dogs to catch than 2-3 G&#039;s of lumpy weed in an envelope)<br /><br />So if something is &#039;caught&#039; after the vendor sends it --- it&#039;s probably going to be &#039;caught&#039; at a sorting facility of some kind, right?<br /><br />In that case - I&#039;d assume that the facility notifies LE of some kind (depends on country/location and what was found I&#039;d guess) and they either:<br /><br />A) somehow try and go after the sender<br />B) somehow try and go after the failed receiver<br />C) Both A&amp;B above<br /><br />If the package makes it all the way to the receiver&#039;s hometown mail facility it could possibly be &#039;caught&#039; there as well I guess<br /><br />Seems like option &quot;B&quot; above becomes the most likely reality at that point and the receiver is either:<br /><br />A) Nothing happens if it&#039;s a small shipment - it&#039;s just confiscated<br />B) Receiver is called in for questioning but if you properly deny and have prepared - there&#039;s little / nothing they can do<br />C) You&#039;re busted through some combination of circumstances that firmly tie you to the package with intent etc<br /><br />I&#039;d just like to hear others weigh in on the overall risk associated with shipping and maybe any &quot;close calls&quot; that some may have had.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />*DAR*<br />
