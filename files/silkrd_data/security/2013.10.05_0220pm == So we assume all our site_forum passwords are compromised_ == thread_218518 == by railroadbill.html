They may not even need to do that, for all we know they may have obtained it when they seized DPR&#039;s laptop. Unless I&#039;m mistaken, the administrator should be able to see everything, including PMs sent between users.&nbsp; As a result, anything posted or sent as a PM on here should be considered in the hands of the Feds, unless it&#039;s encrypted. <br /><br />The Administrator account should also be able to change passwords for users, enabling them to lock out the original owners and allowing the Feds to use those accounts. <br /><br />I think what they&#039;re doing is just watching and gathering intel for now. collecting email addresses, PGP keys, seeing what other Darknet marketplaces people are planning to move to, etc. <br />I believe the Forum will be allowed to continue as long as it is of value to them -- when they have satisfied with what information they&#039;ve collected, they&#039;ll shut it down. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br /><br />

				Even encyrypted passwords can be broken if they can guess your password from a dictionary or brute force. The encyrpted password can confirm a guess so it gives them unlimited guesses.<br /><br />Currently, a random password over 15 characters is unlikely to be brute forced with feasible technology.<br /><br />Passwords under 9 characters will be broken for sure eventually regardless of how random they are.

				A cracked (known) password is a great starting point to defeat other password-protected mechanisms down the road.&nbsp; If they&#039;re ever at a point where they&#039;re stumped by a password to protect FDE/TrueCrypt/PGP keys/SSH keys/whatever, wouldn&#039;t they want to start their dictionary attack with variations on that person&#039;s known passwords?<br /><br />If they see the same, non-trivial, password in two different places, don&#039;t you think it would be a reasonable assumption on their part that the two different accounts belong to the same entity?&nbsp; i.e. UserX at SiteA uses the same password as UserY at SiteB.&nbsp; Same person.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t really cost them anything.. just feed that shit into cuda hashcat or the like and wait a while.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#039;t they?&nbsp; <br />
