				I&#039;m running OSX10.7.2, installed GPG tools and the GPG services absolutely refuse to show up. I&#039;ve uninstalled, reinstalled, and restarted my computer several times, but none of the GPG features appear like they&#039;re supposed to. After much googling it seems like this is a bug that other people have issues with. I then tried to use the guide to use Tormail over Thunderbird, but Thunderbird repeatedly says my username/password is wrong, and also the autoconfig never seems to pick up the Tormail server info. <br /><br />I&#039;m usually pretty computer savvy and can figure this shit out, but it&#039;s just not working. Is there anything else I can try? Is it that bad&nbsp; to just send a seller the shipping address unencrypted? I&#039;d keep trying, but it&#039;s really important that I make my order now (it&#039;s time-sensitive) so I need to get this figured out ASAP.

				Use this for PGP<br /><br />http://www.gpgtools.org/<br /><br />And Thunderbird should work. I have set it up many times with tormail and never had a problem

				Yes, I know. I installed GPG Tools, but the issue is that it didn&#039;t seem to install properly. I tried to encrypt using TextEdit, and under the &quot;Services&quot; menu, there is no OpenGPG option, nor is there an encrypt option when I right-click, like there should be. It shows up in System Preferences, but it won&#039;t appear in the menu.<br /><br />I&#039;ve gone through all the tutorials, but it literally just won&#039;t work. lol.

				Thanks for the help guys. I tried the nightly build as well, didn&#039;t seem to help. Alas, I just got ahold of a PC and went through the GPG setup there and got my public key. yay, but I wish I could get it to work on my Mac :(

				Also forgot to mention.&nbsp; In textedit you needd to convert you text to plain text.&nbsp; Format--&gt;Make Plain Text, or cmd-shift-T...<br /><br />Give the GPG team some time&nbsp; &nbsp;My guess is that they are overwhelmed by all the changes made in Lion that affect them.&nbsp; Part of the reason i still run snow leopard.&nbsp; But even the newer GPG version broke under Snow Leopard.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully in a few months GPG Tools will be solid again.

				LouisCyphre, thank you for the command line install for OS X.<br /><br />When I ran into trouble with GPG on OSX, I decided to go simple and use a Linux liveCD booted on a Windows box, which worked fine from command line.<br /><br />On a separate tangent, how does one reset Lion to allow booting from liveCD or USB?<br /><br />thanks!

				right, i still havent got this to work, but other than that I tried adding some extra security to my computer today at the same time, and since then i havent recieved any messages, which seems wierd, considering some of them were quite urgent messages from customers wanting next day delivery.&nbsp; I have since confirmed some orders in transit and have still not recieved any messages.&nbsp; I was wondering, what possible security addition to my mac could I have made to stop incoming messages from arriving in my inbox.&nbsp; Is this even possible?&nbsp; Would anyone kindly even send me a blank PM to see if it is working or my mailbox is blocked for some reason? Thanks. When i say i cant recieve PM&#039;s it not on the forums im talking about, but the actual SR itself! so plz someone PM me so i can know my inbox isnt fucked!&nbsp; username is the same on SR!

				Also if GPG starts giving you trouble, try opening your activity monitor and look for a process named &quot;GPG Services.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight it and then click &quot;Quit Process&quot; the red octagon icon in the upper left of the window.&nbsp; The process is supposed to close out after a period of time after you use GPG tools.&nbsp; Sometimes it gets hung up on something you are trying to do (encrypt/decrypt message, validate sig, etc).&nbsp; <br /><br />Quitting it out and trying again sometimes works.

				I&#039;m having similar difficulties. I&#039;ve created my key and assigned it to a random/fake email address. When I try to import someones public code (either by the terminal, drag and drop or in the Services&gt;import from selection) nothing seems to work and I get a popup &quot;Import failed--&gt; Code 0&quot; Ive searched for troubleshooting but I cant seem to find an answer to this problem on the web. I feel like I am doing something fundamentally wrong here and Im not sure where to go next. Im running OS X 10.7.4 if that matters and Ive uninstalled/installed GPG keychain access twice now to no success to my problems. Any advice?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a very experienced Mac user so maybe thats part of the problem, I sure do miss Windows 7...sometimes

				Hey guys,&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry if this sounds like a silly question, but I&#039;m fairly new to all this. Ok, so I have an understanding at what the purpose of GPG is used for, although Im not quite sure as to how to apply it. I&#039;ve downloaded the latest GPG tools. I&#039;ve set up a Tormail account a few days back so as to use that. <br /><br />So after installing it, I tried to generate &quot;a new key pair&quot;, so I put in my name (fake name) and used the tormail e-mail account. I&#039;m asked after that to use a passphrase, which I put (twice). It says that its sending key, only after that I get a message saying: &quot;Alert - Send keys failed! Code = 0&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not very tech savvy and I&#039;m on a Mac 10.6.8<br /><br />If anyone would be kind enough to show me where I&#039;m going wrong I&#039;d really appreciate it. I&#039;ve been wanting to start using SR for a little while now and this GPG business is hindering me back, as it seems like its something that everyone (including vendors obviously) here is using it. <br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Jude

				Thank you so much guru for the prompt reply, and thanks for the reassurance, I indeed was afraid lol but I&#039;ve followed all your instructions as posted! <br /><br />I&#039;m going to be a bit more bothersome and ask if there&#039;s any good guide/instructions/video of how to apply PGP, specifically on SR when trying to communicate with a vendor or someone else? I was able to find what my public key is, but where do I go from here? :)<br />
