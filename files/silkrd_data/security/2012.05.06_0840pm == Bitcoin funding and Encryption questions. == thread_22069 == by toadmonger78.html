				Hi so I wondering about these things, as I am a newbie, As far as encryption goes and Plausible deniability. TrueCrypt&#039;s implementation is weak, and crackable keeping the keys on the same HDD is too insecure, even with full disk . FreeOTFE probably the best I have seen, Have any of you guys tried this before? I use this in real life for work.<br /><br />Along with this I think that Two-Factor authentication should be implemented. Gold Key is amazing and FreeOTFE can also have this integrated into it. In the corporate world it is not a concern as to i someone knows I use gold key. Here it may be so what do you guys think? I personally would probably implement it. I currently use secure erase, PGP etc... I boot off my computer HDD as it is secured with a hidden volume and Gold Key. The key can actually quite easily be destroyed, if needed. Just muck up some of the contacts. But You can also change the pin rendering all data useless.<br />This is my take on it but I am unaware as I am unfamiliar with the legal ramifications only the security aspect as that is what I do for a living. Also there is Tresor, but does not provide deniability. Gold key also has a Flash drive version if needed to boot up on USB.<br /><br />What I really need help with though is the money aspect. I currently use MP. But the Fees are expensive, and plus when you use a moneypak it is tracked where it is bought from and where it is cashed to. You can&#039;t lie it asks for your SSN and all. I have actually seen people catch people very quickly like this, usually only with big dogs though. A few thousand isnt going to be much but some people buy like 10 at once. Regardless fees are still high, I am thinking of using Western Union. Those are also tracked though, but Fees are down and it is plausible to give an excuse for that, any bank wire, Bank deposit isn&#039;t secure at all simple. Banks keep the most detailed logs of all these types of services. So I am just wondering what is popular. You can get a western union prepaid card and then send money online using it as a credit. It looked pretty anonymous to me. I can&#039;t think of another plausible way. All I know is the moneypak and Bank wire do not seem like the way to go.<br />Look forward to responses.<br /><br />Cheers

You&#039;re quite right in saying you should use keyfiles and also a cascading algorithim for full disk encryption e.g AES-Twofish-Serpent. This may slow down your computer too much so if you have an older machine just perform full disk encryption with AES and keep your private files inside a Truecrypt container on your machine. If you need help setting this up feel free to post on here.<br /><br />Bank wire is a safe way to purchase small amounts of BTC but as you say if the bank records were to be examined and then someone managed to get access to your Bitcoin exchange&#039;s records it would be possible to trace the funds to whatever BTC addresses you had sent them. It would still be very difficult to link those funds to a specific transaction but I understand your concerns.<br /><br />SugarMama has been trading on SR for some time and will accept funds via Western Union. Another layer of anonymity might be to use Western Union to buy Liberty Reserve USD and change these for BTC using the AurumXChange website - both methods take time and will cost you though.<br /><br />I run a service for people here in the UK exchanging BTC for cash in the mail - perhaps one of our US based sellers could offer this service?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
