				Yesterday I created a linux memory stick yesterday but thought, I would like it to be encrypted.<br /><br />I formatted my memory stick and went through the whole partitioning and creating the hidden part etc.<br /><br />I extracted and ran liberte in the hidden part and it ran the bat file (assuming that operating system was up and running now)<br />I restarted thinking it would go through the whole process but a black screen appeared telling me to remove the usb and press any key to restart.<br /><br />Anyone know why this isn&#039;t working? It should run the setup then once the operating system is running prompt me for the password, right?<br /><br />think that when I boot up with the USB it only sees that there is a file on it that it can&#039;t open. I need it to be able to bypass that file to let it run the operating system. What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />I have re formatted it and partitioned it and created the hidden inner layer.<br />Should I just be able to extract the rar file into the inner hidden layer, run up the set up file then restart<br />and be prompted with a password and then have access to the linux OP? Or do I have to go about getting<br />onto the new OP in a different way, now that it&#039;s in a hidden file? <br /><br />Thanks everyone

				If I&#039;m understanding this correctly, you can&#039;t run linux because that is contained within the truecrypt file, which remains unencrypted at the point of start up?<br /><br />Tbh I don&#039;t see how you could mount the file without first booting the computer. This seems like an impossible task, I could be wrong though.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a Liberte&#039; expert but, it sounds to me like you placed the operating system on the hidden partition when, apparently, Liberte&#039; only wants you to store its data on the hidden partition.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you had it setup properly, when it booted, it would ask for your pass phrase prior to allowing access to your operating system.&nbsp; <br /><br />You might want to think about getting one of these (much easier and better security):&nbsp; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233113

				I agree I think it is just storing as data so it is not letting me run it as an OS<br /><br />I appreciate the link but I don&#039;t really want to pay the money when it is possible to do it this way, cost effective as well.<br /><br />There will just be 1 stupid mistake I am doing and I just have to figure out what it is :(

You&#039;ve encrypted your USB stick with Truecrypt before installing Liberte and following the instructions at : http://dee.su/liberte-install - Truecrypt isn&#039;t necessary as Liberte will create an encrypted partition for you anyway!<br /><br />I suggest you format your USB drive to FAT32 and follow the instructions to install Liberte once again. Let me know how it goes.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br />

				Yeah I have got my head around this now that you cannot use both of these options! :&#039;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve successfully managed to get linux working on my sd card now (picked that so I can snap it if needed)<br />I&#039;m going to use truecrypt for my actual laptop for things unrelated to SR such as torrents :)<br /><br />Thank you all for your time. I&#039;m going to have a shot at getting my head round getting bit coins tomorrow now I have my anonymous system at my advantage. I don&#039;t think it should be too much of a problem there is that nice sticky for it :)<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ll even manage to make my first online order tomorrow if I have the coins in time.
