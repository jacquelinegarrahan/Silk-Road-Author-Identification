				&amp; why were his threads deleted?<br />I don&#039;t think his threads should have been deleted because it got 300+ views and he clearly named<br />out a reputable vendor on here.<br />on note of that another vendor has claimed he placed another order shipping to the exact same address so that leads me to believe he was just a troll..<br />yet I bet a majority of users were tweaked the fuck out because of him and the thread being deleted surely doesn&#039;t help?&nbsp; :o<br />

				I think people need to stop worrying. I forgot that even happened because I got high. This place is just too anonymous (and Awesome ;D)<br /><br />But I really don&#039;t know how LE can get good info to arrest people from these forums. We never say our real names out in the open and most of the time no one talks about the real shipping methods for products. <br /><br />This place is more of an loving community talking about life, vendors, security, and obviously drugs.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />And we, the buyers, can talk to the people who make this site happen and the people who give us the medicine we need. <br /><br />How does it feel? To be on your own? No direction home, Like a rolling stone 8)<br /><br />So awesome hahahaha<br /><br />Goddamn tony, Your regular H is pretty damn strong. Took me so long to write this. hahaha

				We, OP did say it was a drop, and a friend. This is very likely. Very likely the friend popped off at the mouth, and got their ass busted.

				He was likely full of shit so it&#039;s good that he&#039;s fucked off and left the forum alone. And if he wasn&#039;t, hopefully he&#039;s fucked off to find an attorney. But I am still disappointed that the threads got killed.

				Wouldn&#039;t it make sense if this &quot;asshole&quot; did delete his threads? Who wouldn&#039;t do the same. The only reason he would come back is from a whole new computer/location and a new account. Some account with very little posts. This is all conjecture, but heres what I think.<br /><br />He had perfect buyer stats from multiple vendors. He edited out vendors name and deleted threads. He probably destroyed computer and cut off all contact with Roommate A and Roommate B and obviously the nosey neighbor. He has probably contacted an attorney and has sufficient legal protection. The case against him is flakey at best. Without a proof of purchase or any substantial evidence against him he has little need for worry. He has probable deniability and a whole truck load of legal options to defeat any pending charges.<br /><br />When the other vendor came fourth and said &quot;wow im glad my package came through that same day&quot; he clarified by saying he used two different addresses due to vendors package being over a week sense order and more importantly from all the sketchiness involved with the nosey neighbor. I would imagine he would change addresses if not stop ordering all together.<br /><br />He obviously wasn&#039;t out for slander otherwise he wouldn&#039;t have edited out vendors name. He never said his friends got arrested, he stated that when roommate B checked the mail he was confronted by local LE and FBI. Which without him being there and without careful inspection on the roommates part cold have been a variety of Federal LE. People use the term FBI as a broad description of cops in suits.<br /><br />I remember his threads pretty clearly actually.

				I pretty much believe he was just a troll, but since he had a good buying history I don&#039;t know what to think. If I was a vender I would blacklist sending to people like that troll or not. I don&#039;t really see what an established account has to gain from acting like that as a joke.

				Yep: there&#039;s always been crazy shit where you kind of have to read between the lines.&nbsp; And just another good reason that for any serious doings to use, say, TAILS on a flash stick from a library or coffee shop https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html<br /><br />Between paranoia and caution there&#039;s a big old grey area, but I agree with poster that most bad stuff I&#039;ve read on here, often seems to come more from talking too much in a bar and such, rather than any serious investigations.<br /><br />We just never know, and a little bit of buddhist acceptance is probably more valuable than all the tech protection I could come up with.
