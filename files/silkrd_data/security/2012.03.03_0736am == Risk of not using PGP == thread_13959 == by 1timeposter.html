				Title says it all.<br /><br />What are the risk of not using PGP?<br />How would LE figure out a message being sent from one SR user to another just because it isn&#039;t in PGP form?<br />This would mean that some of the more advanced people on this website that aren&#039;t even LE could figure out your address if you don&#039;t use PGP?<br /><br /><br />I created this account to post this one simple question. I will view it without ever logging into this account again because I feel this is a question that would make LE look at me. <br />Even though I don&#039;t use SR for its intended purpose. I just enjoy learning.<br /><br />In theory... You can place an order without PGP and never be caught.<br />In my mind (which knows absolutely nothing about computers)<br />Downloading TOR was hard as hell lol<br /><br />Say you place an order. Send address without PGP. Now I HIGHLY doubt that LE could figure out what you sent without having your computer in their hands. So lets say your package arrives. They come to your door and try to get you to sign for the package (just pretend, i know it prob. wouldn&#039;t go like this) ... you don&#039;t sign. they come back an hour later with a search warrant for your computer. now. 1 of 2 things could happen<br />1. they get your computer. so are they going to be able to see that you typed that? does your computer keep a record of every single thing that is ever typed onto your keyboard or something? how exactly are they going to view this? <br />or<br />2. Lets say you FE and just took your computer to a friends house and left it there and waited on the package. they ask for your computer. you tell them you don&#039;t have one. and if they don&#039;t have a computer to search then they don&#039;t have a way to convict you.<br /><br />ANYBODY COULD SEND YOU DRUGS IN THE MAIL. the fact that &#039;&#039;why would somebody be sending me drugs in the mail, that is a waste of their money&#039;&#039; idea that the police will know/have doesn&#039;t matter. as long as you followed the #1 rule and didn&#039;t say a damn thing besides pleading the 5th, you&#039;ll never be convicted. <br />am i right?<br /><br />or am i just high as a mother fucker!? lol

				If you&#039;re going to be on SR you need to be paranoid as hell. Seriously.<br /><br />Using PGP ensures that no one can read your message except for intended recipient of your message. So why take the risk?<br /><br />There are multiple guides to installing and using PGP. It&#039;s not easy the first time, but just follow the guides to the letter (and some include pictures).

				I recently learned PGP, at the advice and request of a seller I had been dialoguing with. At face it looks hard but it is actually easy as shit to use. Now that I have it figured out, I won&#039;t even send a standard PM without the use of PGP for the simple fact that I am knowing seeking to obtain drugs through the mail- why not protect not only myself but the seller as well? Part of the reason we are all on both TOR and SR begins and ends with anonymity. Privacy is also a luxury that on the clearnet and in different facet of life that we are exceedingly losing at a rapid pace, so use pgp to your advantage, encrypt your privacy, protect yourself and enjoy whatever it is you order with confidence knowing that you have done everything to protect not only yourself but the seller as well. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s essential. If this place were to go down do you really want your address stored in clear text if the vendor hasn&#039;t sent yet? Are you willing to take you future in to your own hands because you don&#039;t want to spend 2 hours reading about something?<br /><br />~Digi

				I&#039;m not even sure there&#039;s a good argument for keeping cleartext messaging! Cost benefit analysis is heavily skewed to encryption.
