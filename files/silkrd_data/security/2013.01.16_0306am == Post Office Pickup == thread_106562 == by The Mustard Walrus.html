				I&#039;m sorry if this is covered elsewhere but I couldn&#039;t find an answer on the forums to totally satisfy.<br /><br />Was expecting a package at the door or in the mailbox today, but after checking tracking I see there was an attempted delivery and the package is now at the post office waiting to be picked up. Now this of course means ID and signature, right? Something I wanted to avoid. I was home, but I guess because I live in an apartment they just skipped the knock on my door and took it straight to the post office. Should I be worried about going in there with ID and having to sign for it? The vendor seems trustworthy but I haven&#039;t ordered from them before and I myself am still fairly new with all this. This is the first post office pickup situation I&#039;ve faced as my other 3 deliveries were simply left in the box.<br /><br />Can I get my package without showing ID and signing? If not, do I really have to worry about going in there and showing ID and signing?<br /><br />Hoping some more experienced folks can help... Thanks!

				had this happen to me once with a larger than large order from europe.&nbsp; stressed me out pretty good to say the least.&nbsp; went in the next day and, I&#039;m not saying this isn&#039;t a more worrisome situation than getting it at your door but I honestly didn&#039;t have any problem.&nbsp; It was evident the women working the desk didn&#039;t want to be there at all and was just going through the motions.&nbsp; Showed ID (didn&#039;t make a copy or anything) then signed a fake name on the PIN pad since most peoples sig&#039;s are unrecognizable anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;Long story short; understand that you are in fact walking into a federal building to pick up a package where you present your ID to get a hopefully stealthy package.&nbsp; Keep a cool head and don&#039;t be lazy where it counts.

				Part of me is not to worried and yet the paranoid part of me just imagines worst case scenarios. But the more I think about it, the more I&#039;m realizing that really the only way it would matter to show my ID and sign (a fake signature if possible) is if the vendor is some LE setup, which I feel is highly improbable! They are new-ish vendors but seem legit and claim to use good stealth with vac seals and all. And, this is a domestic order. So maybe I really have nothing to worry about, right? Just traces of lingering newbie paranoia, right?

				The same thing happened to a friend of mine and we stressed for a couple days. Our solution was to call the post office and ask them to redeliver it. Everything was fine.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read in here it&#039;s not likely they&#039;re going to have LE sitting around the PO waiting for whenever you decide to show up so you&#039;d probablly be okay picking it up. But try phoning first. Tell them you&#039;re handicapped or you get out of work too late to pick up.

				Another interesting thing to note is that I didn&#039;t receive a postal slip indicating a missed package. The knowledge that it is at the postal depot is from the tracking. Not sure why there was no slip. Maybe it will show up today. I don&#039;t know why they wouldn&#039;t just leave it in the mailbox. This is kind of unusual...

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t be worried. But your paranoia is good to some extent! It&#039;s not newbie paranoia...I&#039;m going through something similar right now with usps, I&#039;ve been a member for 6+ months and have ordered a bunch of things. My package tracking shows it was in my area &quot;out for delivery&quot;, but then it got sent to somewhere completely opposite of me (and FAR away)! Like wtf?!? Believe me I&#039;ve been shittin my pants for a little bit. But you just have to calm down, tell yourself there&#039;s nothing more you can do, and if shit hits the fan NEVER TALK. That&#039;s it. <br />I totally think you&#039;re fine though!<br />Ok, so you live in an apartment? Do you think this order was large enough to NOT fit in your apartment mailboxes? If so, that right there would be taking away some of my paranoia. If no slip was left I would NOT do anything yet. Don&#039;t go to the PO, don&#039;t call them yet. Just wait a little bit. If you get the slip I know you can set up redelivery online here: *blah blah clearnet* https://redelivery.usps.com/redelivery/<br />Never had to do that but you may feel safer that way. Although it is pretty much the same as signing the package. If you dont want to sign anything thats a different story and I&#039;m not quite sure what I&#039;d do in that situation either.<br />One time I had a package say &quot;out for delivery&quot; very early in the morning and it should of came that day no doubts. Ended up not coming. Tracking then updated to &quot;notice left&quot; but no notice was left! Turned out that it looked like the PO was backed up and never had time to deliver. I looked things up and it auto updated to Notice Left. Package came next day no problem.<br />In other words, always give it that extra day. USPS could be weird and screwed up sometime. Like with me, sending my package the COMPLETE opposite way after it was in my area! I hope I&#039;m ok too! Pray for me and I&#039;ll pray for you! lol :P<br />Also, domestic is a huge + and hopefully you used a very trusted vendor. If those to statements are true there shouldn&#039;t be any major problems.

				I usually get my pickup slips 1-2 days after the tracking shows it dropped off at the local P.O.

				Thank you for the input, fellas. Fred, just as you said, the slip in fact just arrived today. Went to pick it up, ID and signature, all was well. Kooloap, I hope things work out on your end as well. That story is definitely a pants-shitting situation! Things seem to have a way of working out well as long as we&#039;re all cautious to cover our asses.
