				I have registered at bitcoinfog.<br /><br />I sent bitcoins there a couple of hours ago and it still hasn&#039;t shown up. How long does it usually take for the bitcoins to show up?<br /><br />From what I understand the way bitcoinfog works is you simply deposit bitcoins to bitcoinfog, then wait some time and then withdraw to e.g. Silk Road. Is this correct? For how long should I let my bitcoins sit in bitcoinfog before I withdraw them?

				They&#039;ll get there, don&#039;t worry. bitcoinfog is legit.<br /><br />Wait maybe half a day at least and then put in your withdrawal request. Do it for at least 24 hours of withdrawals (48 hours even better), and starting anywhere from 6 hours to 24 hours. That ought to be good enough. You&#039;ll be getting multiple random-sized deposits to the account of your dreams, SR probably.<br /><br />goblin

				The bitcoins showed up at last. I read some of the info on their site and it seems like such a hassle when they say that ideally you should deposit one amount, then wait, then withdraw an amount that&#039;s smaller than the amount you deposited, then deposit a second amount, (then wait again I guess but I don&#039;t think it said wait again) then withdraw a second time either less or more than the amount you deposited the second time. Fuaaaaark. Does anyone actually do all this???

				I definitely do all they recommend. I am not aware of a better way to break the associations between the sender of the coin and the destination. My favorite path is Cash to Bitinstant to Blockchain. That happens same day, and usually same hour. Then I choose an anonymous payment to Bitcoin Fog. Blockchain&#039;s anonymous process is much less involved, but I still think helpful. Then I choose 72 hours with a six-hour delay (plus or minus. mix it up) from BitcoinFog to SR. I just have some flowing through at all times. That way, I maintain the cleanest Bitcoins I know how to create in my SR account. <br /><br />I know some will think I&#039;m paranoid (definitely), and wasting my money, but I want to be as careful as humanly possible.

				Buyers arent at risk from buying or having coins, its from giving your address out to sellers. Also SR has its own built in mixer and even if you went direct from your bank account to your SR wallet there is no way to identify a wallet as being part of SR or any other site.

I know I&#039;m probably wasting time and money. I&#039;ve been proceeding based on the thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7840.msg70851#msg70851<br />which provides a great deal of references on the anonymity of bitcoins. <br /><br />It concludes:&nbsp; <br /><br />the entire history of Bitcoin transactions is publicly available. In this paper we investigated the structure of two networks derived from this dataset and their implications for user anonymity.<br /><br />Using an appropriate network representation, it is possible to map many users to public-keys. This is performed using a passive analysis only. Active analyses, where an interested party can potentially deploy marked Bitcoins and collaborating users can discover even more information. We also believe that large centralized services such as the exchanges and wallet services are capable of identifying considerable portions of user activity.<br /><br />Technical members of the Bitcoin community have cautioned that strong anonymity is not a prominent design goal of the Bitcoin system. However, casual users need to be aware of this, especially when sending Bitcoins to users and organizations they would prefer not to be publicly associated with.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />You probably know more about it than I, but I can&#039;t be sure yet based on the information I&#039;ve seen, so I&#039;m covering myself six ways to Sunday.&nbsp; ;)
