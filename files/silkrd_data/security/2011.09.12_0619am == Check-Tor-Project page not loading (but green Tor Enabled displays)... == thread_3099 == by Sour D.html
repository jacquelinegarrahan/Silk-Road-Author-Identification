				&nbsp; &nbsp; So all of the sudden, after midnight today (12/9/2011), when I start up Tor I get a TIME-OUT message for the page that verifies your Tor connection is functional (https://check.tor.project.org....). It reads, &quot;The server at check.tor.project is taking too long to respond&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This has never happened to me before. The last time I opened Tor was Friday (09/9/2011), and this page loaded normally. Although this page does not load, I am able to load the (.onion) pages for SR and SR forum. Also, I should note that as usual I have a green &quot;Tor Enabled&quot; text at the bottom right corner of firefox.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I am using Windows 7, and have the Tor Browser bundle (&quot;Start Tor Browser.exe&quot;), version 1.3.24.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My main question is, given that the Check-Tor page has failed to load, am I still protected by the anonymity of Tor, or does this page ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LOAD in order to know for certain that your Tor connection is functional and anonymous??

				I was having a different problem last night (on 9/11/11).<br />It would load but I got a red bomb saying they were having a service problem and could not verify that I was exiting from a TOR node, even though it was showing an IP that wasn&#039;t mine.<br />I found another TOR checking site and got the same thing.<br /><br />I thought &quot;Have they disabled TOR somehow for 911?<br /><br />I saved my bookmarks, deleted my portable install and and loaded the most recent version (with Aurora browser that doesn&#039;t need the shift click trick to refresh the forums&nbsp; :) )<br /><br />Still no go.<br /><br />I rebooted, checked the task manager, killed all shit like Google Toolbar notifier and anything else sitting there trying to update....as I always do) and it was good again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what did it. Maybe the node descriptor system was down and was back up by coincidence by the time I did all of that.<br /><br />Anyone else get that same problem yesterday?<br /><br /><br />As for your problem, try rebooting. Then from the Vadaila panel open the network viewer and the message log. Set the message log for advanced and then go in the settings and tick the info box.<br /><br />I keep those windows sized just such that the message log window is stretched wide and just tall enough so it covers the map portion of the network map but I can see the real time text reports both are giving as connections are trying to be made.<br />I don&#039;t yet understand all I see but it it very instructional to watch and might reveal some clues as to your problem.

				I had some problems with latest Aurora tor bundle.<br />I found that this is not use poilpo and that is a reason for proxy trouble.<br />Anyhow, I have noticed that all traffic goes thru socks5 on port 9050 and http is empty.<br />Socks5 can be liability with dns indetification. I dont know thnicality behind tor and all that but read more on tor.org<br />I unistall newest bundle and now use 0.2.1.30 without problems. Torcheck is OK.

				Good call on the lack of polipo!<br />I just checked the settings and noticed its not using it.<br />It&#039;s doing all of the proxying in Aurora via socks 5?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, I went back.<br /><br />My Tor check problems were either a real outage of the node descriptor service or the need of a reboot I&#039;m guessing cause after going back everything is still fine.<br /><br />The forum cache problem still seems to be gone though? I&#039;ll check that out more but it was a pain having to shift click on refresh all the time.<br />I assumed it was the price of security but what do I know? It might have been a forum bug they fixed while KEEPING GOOGLE BOTS OFF THE BOARD! I hope..............<br /><br />Edit: Nope. The shift click refresh problem is still alive and well&nbsp; :(

				Just a temporay outage.&nbsp; If you get the same error message in the future you can just go to the TorStatus page at http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/&nbsp; There you&#039;ll see whether you&#039;re connected to the Tor network and what relay you&#039;re exiting through.
