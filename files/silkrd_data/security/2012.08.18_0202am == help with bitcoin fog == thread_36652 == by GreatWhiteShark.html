				i purchased bitcoins today and they appeared in my instawallet. i registered for bitcoin fog earlier. i see that it has up to 5 deposit addresses, should i use more than 1? withdrawing from instawallet and depositing into bitcoin fog is clear for me.<br />what i am confsd on is the process of withdrawal from bitcoin fog into my silkroad account. <br />if i want to withdraw my bitcoins from bitcoin fog (BCF), if i enter the full amount from all 5 deposits, will it automatically remove bitcoins from all 5 locations? <br /><br />secondly, what does the &quot;time span&quot; option do? minimum 6 hours and max 96...is this if i am depositing into multiple address? <br />next, is it ok to deposit everything into 1 SR address or is it advisable to create more than one? should i change my SR address after my first purchase? should i register many BCF names and use each one just for 1 deposit?

				And now that you just treated Shannon like a complete prick I just deleted all the answers I had written in this post to you, except the end of the post below, wherin I tear you apart for being a shit bag.&nbsp; Big waste on my part for answering all your questions, but if your gonna treat people like that I have no problem modifying this post and deleting those answers as I just did.&nbsp; Yes Yes, I know, I was never going to help you either, so don&#039;t even bother saying it (because I did write you a lengthy post with answers and then you just turned from LEO namecalling dick to harassing a good member on this forum.&nbsp; Go back to smoking some pole.<br /><br />The reason no one has responded is because everything I just told you is already in these forums, and on the bitcoinfog site, I am just incredibly bored so figured i&#039;d help a stupid ... errr lazy noob out who can&#039;t just go read it for himself.<br /><br />Yes I am being mad and hostile, you&#039;re so impatient that you have to call everyone on the silk road forums LEOs because they haven&#039;t responded to your MANY questions in a very short 5 hour window since your first post?&nbsp; Patience man, learn it for fuck sakes.
