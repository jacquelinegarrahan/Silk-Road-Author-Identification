Gox Targeted by Cyber Attack<br />By Matt EganPublished March 29, 2013FOXBusiness<br /><br />Just as Bitcoin explodes beyond the $1 billion mark thanks to Europe’s debt crisis, the emerging virtual currency was dealt a setback this week after a key exchange was hit by a powerful cyber attack that caused delays.<br /><br />Coupled with other recent technical glitches, this week’s distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox cuts into one of the electronic currency’s greatest selling points: its relative safety compared with deposits in Cyprus.<br /><br />In a message posted on its official Twitter account, Japan-based Mt. Gox told users Thursday night it was “experiencing a major DDoS” attack. Within hours Mt. Gox said the issue had been resolved.<br /><br />The exchange didn’t respond to a request for further comment on the DDoS attack.<br /><br />According to the Mt. Gox website, it is the “world’s most established Bitcoin exchange” and the only multi-currency Bitcoin trading platform.<br /><br />&quot;This attack demonstrates both the worth of Bitcoin and the value of its business availability. Now there are new risks to both,” said Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions at Radware (RDWR).<br /><br />Earlier this week payments startup Dwolla, which is also used to trade Bitcoins, suffered from an apparent DDoS attack as well. <br /><br />Established in 2009, Bitcoin has emerged as a winner in the controversy surrounding Europe’s decision to “bail in” bank depositors in Cyprus to pay for a rescue of the tiny island country’s outsized banking system.<br /><br />The virtual currency is built on an open-source software code and unlike traditional currencies is highly decentralized, making it appealing to those worried about the safety of the monetary system. Bitcoin also says its accounts can’t be seized by local authorities, setting it apart from bank deposits in Cyprus.<br /><br />Underscoring the surge of activity in the virtual currency, one Bitcoin traded as high as $93.06 on Friday, up a whopping 125% from the beginning of March. The value of Bitcoins outstanding has also now surpassed the $1 billion threshold.<br /><br />Bitcoin “is clearly having a breakthrough moment here, and a deeply surprising one given its novelty and nascent infrastructure,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, wrote in a recent note.<br /><br />However, Bitcoin has also faced technical glitches, including one on March 12 that caused the currency’s value to briefly tumble 23% before recovering.<br /><br />“Bitcoin is of course wholly dependent upon the functioning of the Internet,”said&nbsp; Daniel Friedberg, a financial-services attorney at Seattle law firm Graham &amp; Dunn who has a Bitcoin client base.<br /><br />“Users of Bitcoin are not used to any ‘down time’ and have grown accustomed to being able to immediately convert the Bitcoin virtual currency into real legal tender, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Any disruption at all creates customer complaints,” he said.<br /><br />Bitcoin isn’t alone in grappling with cyber attacks. Hacktivists have increasingly set their sets on the U.S. financial system, slowing access to the websites of big banks like J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) in recent months.<br /><br />Earlier this week Wells Fargo (WFC), the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization, acknowledged its consumer banking website was the victim of a DDoS attack.<br /><br /><br />Follow Matt Egan on Twitter @MattMEgan5<br /><br />&nbsp; Print<br />&nbsp; Email<br />&nbsp; Share<br />&nbsp;0 Comments<br /><br />RELATED STOCKS<br /><br />BAC<br />12.18<br />BANK OF AMER...<br />-0.05<br />RDWR<br />37.73<br />RADWARE...<br />+0.61<br />WFC<br />36.99<br />WELLS FARGO ...<br />+0.01<br />JPM<br />47.46<br />JPMORGAN CHA...<br />-0.31<br />RELATED STORIES<br />As Cyprus Implodes, Bitcoin Interest Explodes<br />The &#039;bitcoin&#039; surpasses 20 national currencies in value<br />MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS<br />Are Warehouse Clubs a Good Bargain?<br />The Seven States Running Out Of Water<br />Seven Reasons the IRS Will Audit You<br />Cyber Thieves Nab Billions in Tax Returns<br />McDonald&#039;s Cutting Two Items In Advance of New Products -Report<br />Big Russian money out of Cyprus; crisis endangers flows<br />[What&#039;s This?]<br />SHARE THIS ARTICLE<br /><br /><br />NEWSLETTER SIGNUP<br /><br /><br />Today&#039;s top business headlines, delivered early every weekday morning for a chance to start your day right.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />RECOMMENDED VIDEOS<br /><br />A Long-Overdue Correction?<br /><br />Schiff: Printing Money Will Doom the U.S.<br /><br />Google Glass: Kiss Your Privacy Goodbye?<br /><br />Yale&#039;s Shiller Worried About Drop in Home Prices<br />TRENDING IN TECHNOLOGY<br />1<br />Bitcoin Exchange Hit by Cyber Attack<br />2<br />iPhones Under Siege: What Smartphones Are the Target of Hackers?<br />3<br />Amazon to Buy Review Site Goodreads<br />4<br />For Better or Worse: iPhone is Entry Level Smartphone<br />5<br />Glass Lewis to MetroPCS Shareholders: Vote Down T-Mobile Deal<br />See all trends<br />Joshi on Tech<br />Joshi on Tech›<br /><br />Is Your Smartphone’s Browser Safe?<br />T-Mobile to Hold Exclusive NYC Event<br />Is Samsung About to Unleash an iPhone Killer?<br />FOLLOW FOX BUSINESS<br /><br />Get Our Free Newsletter<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />MORE FROM<br /><br />TOP STORIES<br />&nbsp;REUTERS<br />Will the U.S. Economy Keep Up with Wall Street?<br />With the markets at record highs, investors will be looking to see if the economic recovery is beginning to pick up steam when the latest round of jobs numbers are revealed next week.<br />News<br />Judge Dismisses Most Claims in Libor Suit<br />Technology<br />Bitcoin Exchange Hit by Cyber Attack<br />News<br />UPS Settles Illegal Online Pharmacy Row for $40M<br />News<br />Churchill Downs Bets $160M on Oxford Casino<br />Personal Finance<br />How to Avoid an IRS Audit<br />POPULAR VIDEOS<br /><br />Labor Nominee Controversy<br /><br />Wall Street Journal editorial board member Mary Kissel weighs in on how Tom Perez bends the law to his own ends.<br /><br />Schiff: Printing Money Will Doom the U.S.<br /><br />How to never get a real job and still make money<br /><br />Note to Jared: Stick to Your Diet!<br /><br />A Green Car&#039;s Dirty Secret?<br />ALSO ON THE WEB<br /><br /><br />Judge dismisses some claims in Libor suits<br />Top Ten: MarketWatch’s top 10 stories, March 25 - 29<br />Dell paints a bleak picture of prospects<br />Dell opted for going-private deal on bleak outlook<br />NewsWatch: Why bond funds and ETFs are breaking<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />New York Sees E-Commerce Taking Root In Big Apple<br />Six IBD 50 Stocks Seen Accelerating Earnings Growth<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Four Stocks Joining the New High Party<br />Is This a Black Eye for Buffett?<br />Youku Tudou to Add 33 U.S. TV Shows By Year&#039;s End<br />Prime Instant Video Greenlights Its 8th Original Series<br />If Warren Buffett Were an ETF Investor<br />SECTIONS<br />Home<br />Video<br />News<br />Investing<br />Technology<br />Personal Finance<br />Business Leaders<br />On Air<br />Small Business<br />BROWSE<br />Trending<br />Stock Quotes<br />Video<br />Anchors &amp; Reporters<br />TV Show Schedule<br />Tools<br />Topics<br />Mobile<br />Apps &amp; Downloads<br />SHOWS<br />After the Bell<br />Cavuto<br />Closing Bell<br />Imus in the Morning<br />Lou Dobbs Tonight<br />Markets Now<br />Money with Melissa Francis<br />Stossel<br />Tom Sullivan<br />Varney &amp; Company<br />The Willis Report<br />ABOUT<br />About Fox Business<br />Channel Finder<br />Advertise With Us<br />Jobs at Fox Business<br />Internships<br />Terms of Use<br />Privacy Statement<br />Ad Choices<br />FAQ<br />Media Relations<br />FOLLOW<br />&nbsp;Facebook<br />&nbsp;Twitter<br />&nbsp;Google+<br />&nbsp;LinkedIn<br />&nbsp;RSS<br />&nbsp;Newsletters<br /><br />Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.
