				Is it required to use GPG to encrypt your shipping adress?<br />I have downloaded GPG but when i try to generate a key at around step 3 i&nbsp; keep getting this general error pop up every time, therefore i cant make a key :(

				No, you do not have to encrypt your address.&nbsp; It would be ill-advised not you though.<br /><br />Sun

				rumor has it that the data entered in the shipping screen is deleted. if your paranoia bothers you, then, use encryption for the address you enter. you should also encrypt any messages you send to anyone on sr.

				If the vendor provides a public key, I use it, especially for address, and I always include my public key for the vendor, giving him the option, if he wishes, to encrypt communication.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s good to learn to use it...I&#039;m not totally sure it&#039;s &#039;vital&#039; at this stage of the game, but it can&#039;t hurt, and who knows what the future holds.<br /><br />If you are using windows, this is probably easiest setup: http://www.gpg4win.org/ but there are good threads/stickys showing the various ways of doing this.&nbsp; I&#039;d download and try again, make sure you have a private and public key, and just practice with somebody on here, a time or two, to get the hang of it...I found the documentation with gpg4win to be excellent...just needed to take the time to get it figured out...then I&#039;d save my keys somewhere, either online, swissdisk or wuala, and, again, practice with somebody...<br /><br />We never know for *sure* what we need, as this is all so new...we just protect as best we can, and hope it&#039;s enough...Like I tell all new people, best thing is go to &#039;Security&#039; forums, and start from when this forum was started, back in june, I think...and there are plenty of good threads showing how to do this...takes a bit of determination, but well worth it...once you get the &#039;aha&#039; moment and &#039;get&#039; how pgp works, it&#039;s kind of cool...

				Maybe a bad install or something. Go to download.com and download Revo Uninstaller. Use that to remove gpg4win then try reinstalling it and follow this guide if you haven&#039;t seen it already:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.msg516#msg516

				Great idea^^^: I use Revo for anything I want a good uninstall on.&nbsp; Revo &#039;Pro&#039; is probably the one app I actually pay for.&nbsp; I like being able to remove all that garbage when I want...but the free version is fine, and has served me well for years...
