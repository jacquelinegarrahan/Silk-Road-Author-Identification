				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a new laptop with windows 8 and I can&#039;t seem to find a way to access TOR on it.&nbsp; I used TOR Browser Bundle for my old one, and ORBOT on my phone.&nbsp; Also, GPG 4 WIN won&#039;t install.&nbsp; Anyone have any luck with a windows 8 laptop and finding TOR and GPG programs that will work?&nbsp;

				I would not use TOR on a Windows 8 computer unless you were running a VPN router program such as HideMyAss as well that encrypts and hides all your internet activities, and even then you aren&#039;t %100 with Windows 8. <br /><br />You can however use TOR on it by installing the program onto another medium such as flash drive, and access it that way. Doing this also allows you to remove said program once you have finished along with any other information on the drive and hide it.<br /><br />Personally I use a 32GB mini flash to store all my Bitcoin data, files I want safe and TOR and remove it once I have finished.<br /><br />Make sure you create a fake backup version of your Bitcoin wallet and swap it for your genuine one that you keep backed up on the exterior drive that you need to put into the following directory<br /><br />(Drive):\User Name\App Data\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat but this applies to Vista/Win7 computers and I am unsure where it would be stored on a Win8 Computer as I uninstalled Win8 as soon as I received it as I soon learned it sucked donkey nuts.

I don&#039;t know a great deal about Linux; I have experimented a little but its kind of daunting. I am absolutely fascinated and compelled by it however, ever since I read an essay by Neal Stephenson &quot;In the beginning was the Command Line&quot; in which he makes the analogy of a crossroads where there are competing car dealerships. One (microsoft) sells Station wagons. They have got better over the years and dont break down so much these days and they pretty much get the job&nbsp; done and are cheap. Another (Apple) sells sleek sports cars; highly engineered but you cant get under the hood to tinker. Across the way another (Linux) are giving away Tanks. Indestructible Super fast Tanks. They just keep rolling whatever happens. For free. And yet 90% of people walk past.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, as far as windows 7 goes I&#039;m in UK and plenty of places are still bundling windows 7 with laptops. I&#039;m after something about £300-£400 with i3 or i5 processor and dedicated graphics. I heard NVIDIA cards work well with linux? This surprised me as the main reason I gave up on linux with my current machine was problems getting drivers for my ancient Geforce 440. It might have been childs play to an experienced Linux user but it baffled me until I decided I was spending far too much time on this shit!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Failng that surely I could get a pirate version of windows 7?I&nbsp; realise that XP is on its way out, I wasn&#039;t serious. ?But windows 8 looks like as load of bells and whistles. I like my tech devices to have a traditonal system of nested directorys, not some weird touch screen tiles.<br /><br />Also tempted by the google Nexus 7 tablet. Seems like excellent value.<br /><br />Anyway I guess this isn&#039;t my shopping list thread, sorry.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

The machine in question is an Acer V5 Aspire laptop.<br />&quot;I wanted to get into the BIOS. The instructions and posts on the Acer forums both said to tap the F2 key repeatedly when the Acer logo screen appears during power-up. No matter how quickly I began tapping the F2 key after a cold restart, I could never get into the BIOS. I called Acer tech support and they described how I could boot to the BIOS from within Windows. Although this worked, it didn&#039;t solve the problem of getting into the BIOS at power-up. I then spoke with a Level 2 technician who was quite knowledgeable.<br /><br />&quot;Acer&#039;s shutdown icon lets you select Sleep, Hibernate, Restart, or Shutdown. According to the tech, you must hold down the Shift key while clicking the shutdown icon — and continue to hold Shift until the machine fully powers off. I was then able to enter the BIOS during system startup.<br /><br />&quot;The tech stated that Windows 8 doesn&#039;t really shut down when you click the shutdown icon (or go to Power via the Charms bar/Settings). Instead, Win8 goes into a sort of &#039;deep sleep&#039; mode, similar to hibernate. This is one of the techniques the OS uses for fast boots. However, when booting from this &#039;deep sleep&#039; mode, you can&#039;t enter the BIOS via F2. You can get into the BIOS only after a &#039;hard&#039; shutdown (for lack of a better term).<br /><br />&quot;I then tried the shutdown command Fred used to create a custom shutdown tile [Nov. 1, 2012, item]. That command also performed the necessary &#039;hard&#039; power-down needed to access the BIOS.<br /><br />&quot;Have you heard of this power-down mechanism — where power-down is really just a form of hibernate/deep sleep? Do you suppose this is something unique to Acer machines or common to all Windows 8 machines?&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s normal behavior for Win8, Pete. By default, that operating system&#039;s core never shuts down all the way! It&#039;s part of a new feature — fast startup.<br /><br />When you issue a standard power-down command to Win8, it carries out a hybrid shutdown. Win8 first closes and terminates all user sessions in the expected way. Next, it copies what&#039;s still running in RAM (primarily, the live core of the operating system — the system kernel) onto the hard drive. It then turns off the system hardware.<br /><br />When Win8 starts up after a hybrid shutdown, it performs a hybrid boot. As soon as the hardware&#039;s ready, the core of the OS reloads from the hard drive; Win8 then picks up right from where it left off. Thus, the OS itself is up and ready to go in a flash. You still have to reload your apps and data the normal way, from scratch.<br /><br />For more info on Win8&#039;s Fast Startup hybrid shutdown/hybrid boot, see the MSDN blog post, &quot;Delivering fast boot times in Windows 8.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s how it works on most current hardware. However, on some of the newest systems, Win8 can employ an even faster option via a new kind of low-level firmware — Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI; Wikipedia info). The UEFI replaces the traditional BIOS that&#039;s been a part of every PC since the first IBM PC shipped in 1981.<br /><br />Simply put, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) boots and runs the PC until an operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.) wakes up and takes over. The BIOS has worked well for over 30 years, but with new hardware and software, it&#039;s showing its limitations.<br /><br />UEFI acts like a BIOS for operating systems that expect to see a BIOS, but it also adds new functions for UEFI-aware OSes, such as Win8.<br /><br />On a UEFI-equipped PC, Windows 8 can have astonishingly fast startups — especially if the system is also equipped with a solid-state hard drive. How fast? Check out this YouTube Microsoft video, which shows a Win8 laptop booting from dead-off to Start Screen in about seven seconds!<br /><br />(For a more detailed explanation of Win8/UEFI technology, see the MSDN blog post, &quot;Designing for PCs that boot faster than ever before.&quot;)<br /><br />As you discovered, Pete, you need to take an extra step to fully shut down Windows 8. There are actually several ways to do so:<br /><br />To bypass the hybrid shutdown/boot process, do a command-line shutdown (e.g., shutdown.exe /s /f /t 00). Or embed the command in a custom tile, as I describe step by step in the Nov. 1, 2012, LangaList Plus item, &quot;Add custom tiles to the Win8 start screen.&quot;<br /><br />Use Acer&#039;s Shift-key trick — other vendors probably provide something similar to trigger a complete shutdown.<br />Disable fast startup via the Shutdown settings in Win8&#039;s Power Options menu. Open the Win8 Control Panel and click Hardware and Sound/Power Options/System Settings. Scroll to the bottom of the dialog box and deselect Turn on fast startup (highlighted in Figure 1).<br /><br />Figure 1. Disabling Win8&#039;s fast-startup option will let the OS shut down completely.<br /><br />New technologies often require some rethinking and/or relearning of the traditional ways of doing things. You&#039;re among the first to run into this, Pete, but many of us are right behind you!<br />
