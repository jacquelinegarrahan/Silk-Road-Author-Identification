				<br /><br />I have been using Tor on and off for some time now. For the last year the ONLY way I have used Tor is with Virtual Machine that forces all traffic over Tor or dropped&#039;s it.

				This is a great guide. I think this accomplishes the same thing as my Whonix-Gateway tutorial: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161335.0

				<br /><br />Basically, but i dont see the need to run 2 VM&#039;s as you do with whonix.

The Whonix Gateway is a preconfigured solution. You only have to set the networking up on the workstation and don&#039;t have to deal with iptables rules, etc. But your way is good too.<br />

				<br /><br />Both ways are great, and 100 times then the browser bundle or any proxy.

				Another good solution is to use a VPN (anonymous, no-log VPN of course, sign up through Tor with btc) combined with Tor using a Linux distros, boot from USB.<br /><br />PB.

				<br />I dont understand the whole VPN thing. Tor is basically a big, random, anonymous VPN.<br />The point im trying to make is that the browser bundle, or any app that simple use Tor as a proxy is not a good option. They can give you IP away in a dozen ways. If you want really secure access to Tor you should use A middle box VM or Whonix gateway setup.&nbsp; &nbsp;

For those in areas with fewer active internet connections this is important as the ISP can quite easily see which of its customers are accessing Tor - obviously not an illegal act, but why share this with your ISP?

				Mhaura, theoretically Tails could be rooted. An attacker who roots Tails can disable the firewall and bypass Tor. This guide protects against that because Tor runs outside of the VM.<br /><br />The chances are slim of that happening, but that&#039;s the worst case scenario. A more practical approach is that you might not like Tails. In this setup (as well as my Whonix-Gateway guide), you can make any OS the workstation and isolate it behind Tor.<br />
