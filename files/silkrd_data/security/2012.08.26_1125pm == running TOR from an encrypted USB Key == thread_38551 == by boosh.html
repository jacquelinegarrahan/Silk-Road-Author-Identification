				So have a program (Steganos) that fully encrypts a USB key where I have TOR installed and run it from there.<br /><br />But have been running TOR on a hard drive for a while now previous to this.<br /><br />How secure is it as far as leaving no traces on the hard drive running TOR from an encrypted USB key?<br /><br />and how does one best go about removing all current (and any future for that matter) traces of TOR on the hard drive?<br /><br />Much thanks for all help on this!<br />

				You should not be running TOR for purposes like this on your primary OS anyways. Your two best options are:<br /><br />1. Liberte linux. <br />It&#039;s a distro that runs off your USB with encrypted persistence. <br /><br />2. Isolation via virtualization. IE: openBSD in several VM&#039;s. One for every network application.<br /><br /><br />I prefer number one. Hell, you could put that on a micro SD and swallow it if you had to. <br />

				Thanks<br /><br />actually have a Liberte USB key as well but its just such a pain in the tail rebooting everything every time one wants to log onto SR just to check something.<br /><br />was wondering what kind of traces having TOR on a USB would leave behind as I am not super computer savvy.<br /><br />was able to set up the Liberte just from reading the forums but have no idea about virtual machines...

				Here&#039;s an easy way to do it (if you&#039;re a vendor I&#039;m sure you have a more better secret way&nbsp; ;) )<br />1. Download/install Truecrypt<br />2. Encrypt your usb stick using Truecrypt but click the hidden partition<br />3. Put an easy crackable password for the visible partition <br />4. Make a hard uncrackable password for the hidden partition (google one they have generators)<br />5. Put embarrassing stuff in your visible partition like naked pictures of guy, nudes of your ex, whatever.<br />6. Put all your illegal stuff like TOR into your hidden partition <br /><br />Now if your usb ever gets confiscated and they make you decrypt it or crack it cause you put such an easy password, they&#039;ll only get to your visible partition and you can say like &quot;fine you got me, I have a problem, okay!!&nbsp; :&#039;(&quot; <br /><br />I personally hide my encrypted usb anyway because the best way to get away with it is for LE to not even have access to it, yes this might be an inconvenience but I&#039;m not saying stick it in a jar of peanut butter in a ziploc bag, I&#039;m just saying hide it somewhere. You can even get one of those micro flash drives that are smaller than the tip of your finger and then just use an adapter to access it and when you&#039;re done browsing SR just put it away. Just stay away from terrorism and CP and the cops won&#039;t bother you&nbsp; :D

				Delta&#039;s advice was great.&nbsp; You would do well to do things this way.<br /><br />However, your original question was more about the residue of your actions on your current hard drive.<br /><br />It&#039;s really hard to give you good advice here as I have no idea if you were doing things besides browsing when you were on SR.<br /><br />So, the best advice is to just wipe your hard drive and reinstall your operating system.&nbsp; Check out DBAN to wipe your drive.&nbsp; (Be prepared to let it run for a long, long, time.)<br /><br />Alternatively, format the drive, hit it with a hammer, hit it again (and again, and again, and again.)&nbsp; Take the little pieces and throw it in a field.&nbsp; Go to newegg, buy another hard drive.&nbsp; (They are cheaper than 1G of cocaine on SR.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Sure I&#039;m paranoid.&nbsp; But am I paranoid enough?
