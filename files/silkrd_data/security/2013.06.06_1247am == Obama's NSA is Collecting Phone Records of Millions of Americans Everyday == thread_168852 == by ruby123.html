				<br />Obama&#039;s NSA is Collecting Phone Records of Millions of Americans Everyday<br /><br />Nick Gillespie|Jun. 5, 2013 8:35 pm<br /><br />http://reason.com/blog/2013/06/05/obamas-nsa-is-collecting-phone-records-o<br /><br />The Guardian has secured documents that demonstrated just how vast and unrestrained state surveillance is in Barack Obama&#039;s super-transparent, post-War on Terror America:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The National Security Agency is currently collecting the telephone records of millions of US customers of Verizon, one of America&#039;s largest telecoms providers, under a top secret court order issued in April.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The order, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, requires Verizon on an &quot;ongoing, daily basis&quot; to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the US and between the US and other countries.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Fisa) granted the order to the FBI on April 25, giving the government unlimited authority to obtain the data for a specified three-month period ending on July 19.<br /><br />The content of calls is not collected but everything else is, including both numbers involved, location data, and other unique identifiers.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The information is classed as &quot;metadata&quot;, or transactional information, rather than communications, and so does not require individual warrants to access. The document also specifies that such &quot;metadata&quot; is not limited to the aforementioned items. A 2005 court ruling judged that cell site location data – the nearest cell tower a phone was connected to – was also transactional data, and so could potentially fall under the scope of the order.<br />

				Yeah I have no idea wtf SR is off of TOR for example.&nbsp; These things need not be discussed.&nbsp; I doubt they&#039;re censoring everything; they&#039;re probably mainly looking for people speaking Arabic with &quot;gun&quot; or &quot;bomb&quot; anywhere in the discussion.&nbsp;

				FBI already knew about the bombers.&nbsp; They were warned a couple times.&nbsp; They were warned about them by the Russian government.&nbsp; <br /><br />The NSA is going to be saving all electronic communication in the US for over a hundred years.&nbsp; I made a thread about this a couple months ago.

				Sorry @Rastaman. I hear you. <br /><br />I&#039;m just very passionate about this issue. Not just the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA, but the DOJ, the IRS, the entire failed Foreign Policy, in fact the entire lie that is the Obama administration. <br /><br />We were sold a BIG LIE with this character. Instead of Hope and Change, we have Fear and Loathing. Never have we had a more divisive president. <br /><br />Never have we had a more secretive president. (anyone remember the whole &#039;transparency promise&#039;?) - It was such an elaborate campaign promise, in hindsight, it was obviously insincere.<br /><br />Just watching the current bullshit coming out of the White House is nauseating. Susan Rice?? Really ??? Didn&#039;t they blame the whole Benghazi lie on her? - Now Obama sings her praises as he promotes her to National Security Adviser? <br /><br />The news cuts away from the scandalous stories and we go right into &quot;Baseball Players Doping????&quot; No - it&#039;s you the American people that are doping, on this whole feed bucket of bullshit called the mainstream media. <br /><br />My wish is that my fellow citizens become a lot more active in politics, at whatever level they can. Though I fear it&#039;s too late some times. <br /><br />Even at the local level, you may get involved, and then find you&#039;re being investigated by the Family Services Unit, for totally unfounded claims. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot to battle against. It&#039;s not a fight for the faint of heart. <br /><br />We need to hold all of those accountable. ACCOUNTABLE ! ! !

				Despite the current rather odious regime in the US, there is stil hope embedded on the constitution and provisions therein which can be used to push back aginst the state&#039;s ever expanding intrusions into the freedoms and liberties of the people. In the UK we lack a constitution with our head of state intalled from a single ruling family. illiberal doesn&#039;t quite dapture it as the ruling royals have the right to veto laws after they have been introduced to parliament. They have used this &#039;right&#039; at least 30 times in the last few years (though the rules as to when and what they can veto are &#039;secret&#039;), including in matters relating to the taxation of profits accrued from huge tracts of land they hold. Oh, and the Queen (Obama&#039;s equivalent in the UK) is allowed to invest using pseudonyms (the only person leagally allowed to do so) and is &#039;incapable&#039; of commtting a crime in the UK: the prosecutors belong to the crown and she can not prosecute herself. So while the US is definitely going through hard times, at least people are talking about the illiberal turn. In the UK, draconian practices and the absence of any real democracy pass with little comment.

Sure you have scum of the earth lawyers from breeding grounds of left wing fanaticism, like Columbia, and Harvard. Really any of the once respected Universities, have been overrun with Communist vermin, whose only mission in life, is to destroy the United States. <br /><br />I&#039;m in my 40&#039;s and I&#039;ve never feared my government more than I do today. Not for my own safety, so much as the country as a whole, and the damage they&#039;ve done. Most of which is only just beginning to be felt. <br /><br />The nightmare of Obamacare. Setting the Middle East on fire. Supporting Al-Queda. Helping to topple governments there, only to help put into power the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sharia Law. What does that tell you about Obama? <br /><br />The only hope now, is that the press has finally turned on him, after having been the target of his &quot;Dirty Tricks&quot;. Though most of them are just doing what they&#039;re told, regardless of their personal beliefs. All the major media outlets are owned by one conglomerate. The once &#039;free press&#039; now resembles the former Soviet Union&#039;s Pravda.

				All of the blame shouldn&#039;t be placed solely at Obama&#039;s feet, do not forget that the Patriot Act requires judicial approval before these types of actions can be taken. <br />Part of the blame must lie with Congress who perpetually renew the Patriot Act, as well as the judges who will do whatever they are told once they receive their non-elected appointment. <br /><br />When all 3 &quot;separate powers&quot; conspire, the people are the ones left with 0 protection. <br />Just my 0.02 BTC

				Fuck that. I say fight fire with fire. In the real physical world, you don&#039;t ever want to go up against the government because you can easily be overpowered and will always be outrunned and outgunned. As for the virtual world, the playing field is leveled with individual computers, the internet, encryption, Tor, proxies, VPNs and the proper skills to use it all. Case in point, a couple of years ago one prominent Congressman screamed bloody murder about SR and vowed that it would be taken down. Hasn&#039;t happened. How many individual busts have happened since then? Out of how many transactions? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands?<br /><br />I think I&#039;ve made my point.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168852.msg1207186#msg1207186">Quote from: SOUTHPAW on June 06, 2013, 06:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Low tech it is then.&nbsp; Back to coded short wave radios.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />The big fish are the ones being fished for or that the nets are being put out for.&nbsp; You just have to be sure you understand the nets are out there and watch where and who your swimming with.&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
