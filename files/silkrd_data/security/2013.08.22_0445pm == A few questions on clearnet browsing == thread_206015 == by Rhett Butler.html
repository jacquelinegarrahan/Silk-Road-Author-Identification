				Hi all, thank you for taking time and helping me in advance.<br /><br />I am using a secondary os with tor <br /><br />I have 2 questions at this time<br />1.) Should I just stop using a regular browser on this computer?(Normal os) That way I have no way of getting malware ect. Or is it okay to browse freely?<br /><br />2.) Are torrents safe to download and save and the normal os?

				Torrents are never safe !!!<br /><br />Not when using TOR!<br /><br />That goes for the use of Flash (shockwave) and pdf files too.<br /><br />A normal O.S. like windows is not safe either.<br /><br />Stick to TAILS.<br /><br />I sure do hope that TAILS will drop the firefox 17,that is in use by TAILS 2.0.<br />No matter how the CEO&#039;s of TAILS ensure the safety of tails,I hope to see the firefox 2.3 in TAILS 3.0.<br /><br />The (zero day)exploit, that the FBI gave to the visitors of the FREEDOM hosting provider,is made for firefox 17.<br /><br />The patch is to type about:config (Address)<br />Promise to be carefull<br />Search for websocket<br />Go to network websocket and change from default true into false (by clicking the enterkey)<br /><br />That should prevent the use of the bug in ff 17

				mixing illegal activities is never advisable. also depends on how big of a target you are. keep them as separate as possible.<br /><br />get a seedbox... nice for security when doing torrent

Reinstall.&nbsp; &nbsp;Closely inspect the files before you copy them to the newly installed system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d scan them with multiple types of AV.&nbsp; &nbsp;Presto.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pain in the ass.<br /><br />Which is why, after going through that fucking circus a time or two, paranoid people get very careful about doing anything that could get malware on their main OS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use VMs for browsing, downloading, opening shit from places you can&#039;t trust, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;With virtual machines, you can use snapshots (or immutable disks) to just roll your desktop image back to where you were before you were browsing, automatically.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Torrents:<br />4.

How do I overwrite files?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I haven&#039;t used torrents much, so somebody else is better off taking this one.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Encryption<br />7. How do I encrypt my hd? Truecrpyt or a similar program?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are lots of tutorials here and on clear websites.&nbsp; Google/etc will return some great tutorials.&nbsp; <br />Truecrypt isn&#039;t a bad pick for Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;For Mac, you&#039;re largely stuck with FileVault, which is better than nothing (but Apple has done some truly stupid shit with the way they&#039;ve implemented it in the past).&nbsp; &nbsp;On Linux, full-disk encryption using LUKS/dm_crypt is available with most installers.&nbsp; Search for &quot;full disk encryption&quot; and whatever operating system you have.&nbsp; You&#039;ll find lots of them.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Misc<br />8.

Any tips on doing #9<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, because I tend to just wipe and reinstall for most major problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I don&#039;t have a lot of expertise in fixing things.&nbsp; Tend to burn things to the ground during troubleshooting.<br /><br />With a second computer, you can separate your normal use computer from your &quot;I wanna be anonymous&quot; computer, that makes life a lot easier.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your anonymous machine shouldn&#039;t ever need your real name, real address, phone number, Facebook account name/password, public email name/password, etc every typed into it.&nbsp; Ever. <br /><br />Or boot Tails from USB and use persistent storage.&nbsp; And use that for anonymous stuff.&nbsp; You could do a lot worse than that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d use Tails before I&#039;d use Windows for anything requiring any privacy.
