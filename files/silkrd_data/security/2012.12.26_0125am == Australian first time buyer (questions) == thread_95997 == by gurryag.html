				Mate, no offense but don&#039;t rush things as that only leads to mistakes. You should continue to research things but if you must order, do this.<br /><br />To simplify things on your first order, use the bitcoin address located under ACCOUNT on the SR site to have your coins deposited into. This address has to be added to the Spendbitcoins form you submit when placing your order. Normally you would have the coins sent to a wallet on your P.C and then transfer them to your SR address when your ready to order. By using your SR bitcoin address, it will eliminate some hassle for you and make it easier but don&#039;t do it again in case SR goes down. Just make sure that you order straight away after your coins are in (try to not leave coins on SR). Encrypt your name/address using PGP (Gpg4win or Gpg4usb). Spendbitcoins are reliable vendor who always come through. There is a lot to get your head around so please keep reading and learning so your prepared and understand about remaining anonymous and staying secure.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thank you. I understand everything you have written. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to transfer bitcoins directly to SR so I was going to send them to my bitcoin.org address then to easy wallet then to SR.<br />Thanks for the tip about not leaving bitcoins on SR. Wouldn&#039;t that be hard though? Considering I have to factor in cost + postage + 10% spendbitcoin fee + anything else<br /><br /><br />

If you find you have too many coins left over after placing your order, just transfer them back to your bitcoin.org address for next time. Hope that helps.&nbsp; :)

				Yes, if the site went down, for what ever reason, you could potentially lose any coins in your account. I&#039;m not saying anything will happen, none of us know for sure, but it&#039;s best to err on the side of caution and always minimize your risk.&nbsp;
