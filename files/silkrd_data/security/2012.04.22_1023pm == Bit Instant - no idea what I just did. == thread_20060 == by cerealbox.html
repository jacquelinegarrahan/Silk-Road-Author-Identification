				So I tried bitinstant and I followed the instructions and then it was over and I have no idea what to do now. I have an email about my transaction, but I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s for or what to do with it. Am I supposed to do something at the bank now? What do I do? It really wasn&#039;t very clear how it works.

				It was a little unclear for me as well, I hadn&#039;t recieved the money into my mtgox acct about 4 hrs after my bank deposit so I emailed bit instant and they had it in my mtgox in under 10 mins so just email them if your having trouble. I still dont understand how they know who&#039;s depositing money and which acct to credit it too. The only links are the invoice numbering, routing number and acct number. Bank of America didn&#039;t even write down the invoice number when I deposited the cash that could be why I had a delay and had to email them. Do you guys know if there supposed to write down the invoice number when your depositing cash at the bank.

				So... am I supposed to make a cash deposit now or something? I only know how to make a deposit into my own account and it requires I fill in information that they didn&#039;t give me, such as the first and last name on the account.

				The standard way to do this is after you have filled in the info for a cash deposit -&gt; Mt. Gox on Bitinstant a new window will open for CashTrust. You pick the bank and branch (not too near your house), go there and fill out a standard deposit slip. All you have to put in there is the account # given to you and the name CashTrust Holdings, Inc. You don&#039;t need the invoice #. That&#039;s it. Usually it will be in your Mt. Gox account within the hour.<br /><br />Mt. Gox now has a new feature where you can set up the transfer there but I don&#039;t like having to do any more than necessary there, mostly because you can&#039;t access your account through Tor. Also, make sure that you set up your Mt. Gox account with a fake name and Tormail email address.

				I believe they know who to credit deposits to based on the dollar amount and the bank branch it was deposited at. The small fee added by TrustCash is probably used to create a unique deposit amount. I thought this was a pretty cool way to do this so there is no need to tell the bank teller any other info.

				I called BitInstant right after the deposit, they verified my amount and email and had the money in Mt. Gox in 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />Call them. MUCH quicker!
