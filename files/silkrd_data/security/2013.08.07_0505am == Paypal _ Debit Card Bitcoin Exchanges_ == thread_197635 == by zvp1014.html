				Hey all-<br /><br />what are some decent exchanges that can process either Paypal or Debit cards? The exchange I currently use requires me to go through a different virtual currency first, which usually results in a significant loss on my end.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hey&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I know that this kind of thing is available, but in my experience it requires you to register all your ID with the company (in anticipation of the having to comply with the &#039;post sept 11 money laundering control&#039; laws). There&#039;s significant discussion going on now about how bitcoin can be regulated in a similar fashion to cash money.. Bullshit in my opinion - it destroys the whole idea (even if I -wasn&#039;t- using it to buy drugs!).<br /><br />Anyway, I would steer clear of anything like this regardless of if you have to register ID. As soon as you purchase using paypal/any kind of card, then you are irrevocably linked to that btc address. Chances are low that anything would happen, but I sure as fuck wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable.<br /><br />Paypal are in cahoots with the devil - they -actively- offer up info to LE about transactions they think -may- be undesirable. No warrant, nada. There are cases that they&#039;ve refused to honour btc transactions as well. They are all about CARE (cover arses, retain employment).<br /><br />Stay safe. It may be worth wearing that loss to avoid losing your freedom. (I don&#039;t mean to sound patronising - it&#039;s easy to overlook these things)

				Everything pers said.&nbsp; There are probably places that accept cc/pp etc for btc, but I wouldn&#039;t turn around and spend those coins on the road.&nbsp; That being said, your op is still a valid question, assuming you want to pay/writeoff taxes on your coins.

				I buy mine from bitbargain.They require I.D. yes but once bought,transfer to another account (or 2 or 3) before sending to SR.you can always change your account every time you get BTC and the old ones are destroyed.OK, the law will know you bought BTC but will never know where it went.<br />As for PP,you can buy coins from e-bay but they are well overpriced and you have even more records of you purchasing them.
