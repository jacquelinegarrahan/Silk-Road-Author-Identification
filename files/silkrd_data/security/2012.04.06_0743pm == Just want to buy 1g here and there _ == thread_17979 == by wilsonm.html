				<br />If I am just going to order a little bit of weed now and then do I really need to do the whole security thing or can I just use tor on my desktop and then do everything like set up e-mail and bitcoin through tor ?<br /><br />Cheers for any help ;)<br /><br />I will only be doing UK to UK ordering.

				Since the penalty for possession of such a small amount of marijuana is pretty low in UK, I&#039;d say it doesn&#039;t matter too much. I&#039;m pretty sure they just take it away and give you a slap on the wrist.

				I buy more than just weed and I don&#039;t use tails or anything above the Tor browser. I don&#039;t think excess paranoia is warranted for personal amounts except possibly in the US because of the hardcore DEA. I&#039;m in Canada and I know that no investigation into my PC will take place as it&#039;s just not worth it for personal amounts. <br /><br />You&#039;re fine, and no they can&#039;t trace you through Tor unless you have javascript or other add-ons activated on certain sites. The only thing that systems like Tails is for is to remove all local evidence, which is of low importance for personal use.

				@ the OP. Just do the security stuff anyway dude, it&#039;s so easy to do and easy to set up and learn then why the fuck would anyone want to risk it. It&#039;s much easier to just make the minimal effort on it and not have to deal with a fine or whatever that would go on your record. On top of that if they find out you are on SR they could try and turn you to give them info or something. <br /><br />Bad times all round there. Just make the effort mate, you know it makes sense.
