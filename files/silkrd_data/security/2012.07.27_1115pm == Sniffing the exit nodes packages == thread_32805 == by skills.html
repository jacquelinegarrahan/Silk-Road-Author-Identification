				If you really do care about safety, always use PGP/GPG .<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this has been asked before, but i really would love to know if there is SSL encryption on the login submission.<br /><br />Mount a tshark or run tcpflow (This will keep all the data and it&#039;s difficult to filter the information, use a tshark. Search for the terms and learn how to). target facebook cookies and voil√°, you can fuck someone&#039;s account pretty easily if they access facebook without https (You can activate or deactivate the encryption. If encryption is enabled you&#039;re safe) and using TOR;<br /><br />I feel sorry for those who don&#039;t use GPG, it&#039;s never enough to remember users to do it. There is A LOT of data flowing on tor network providing from SR

				There&#039;s no need for SSL, because this is a hidden service so you don&#039;t use exit nodes to get here. Communications are encrypted up to the hidden service, no exit nodes in between.

Exit nodes are just that, an exit from the tor network. They are the nodes via which one might access the &quot;clear net&quot;. Relay-nodes are QUITE a bit different.

				Hidden service connections are TLS encrypted end to end by Tor, in a sense they do not use exit nodes although they still do use nodes that have the exit flag.

				In fact Tor is not even considered to be an onion router by its developers, so the name The Onion Router makes no sense. They consider it to be leek routing, although the people from the Navy who originally came up with the concept of onion routing still consider Tor to be a type of onion router (I wonder if they would consider I2Ps garlic routing to be onion routing also). It probably has somewhat to do with patent trolling and Tor trying to avoid that.
