				There seems to be something wrong with mtgox, I&#039;m trying to claim funds from bitinstant to coinapult and there&#039;s a message stating &quot;MtGox is holding up BitInstant transactions. We&#039;ve contacted them, and are working on fixing the issue.&quot;&nbsp; So as of right now I have 0btc when I should have 20+, bullshit.&nbsp; Anyways let me know if you make any progress

				hi guys,<br /><br />yeah I just had the same problem ealier, im new and was trying it out for the first time.<br />I assumed it was because MT GOX dont work with tor.<br />So I set up an instawallet and transferred to that and then sent it onto SR and that worked fine.<br /><br />It left mt gox instantly but took 20mins to properly appear with my instawallet and then 3 hours to appear on SR. I guess its the tumbler.<br /><br />I must say that instawallet is really easy to use and saves you from downloading 2GB of block history with a PC based personal wallet.

I know I didn&#039;t have good connections to the bitcoin network etc, but seriously? 12 hours?!?<br />

				&nbsp;:o :o :o Why would you transfer from MT straight to SR... Wash those coins a little first. At the very least transfer them to an offline wallet before sending them to SR

The chain is public, it&#039;s obvious to see.<br /><br />You need to use a tumbler or even better a mixer. BitCoinFog is a good start.
