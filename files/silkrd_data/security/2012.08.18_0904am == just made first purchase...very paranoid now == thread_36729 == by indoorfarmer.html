				It&#039;s possible that cops sell on here, yes. There&#039;s no way to know. Since there is no way to know, you need to take steps to protect yourself. The best way to protect yourself as a buyer is to research a vendor&#039;s rep, have the dope sent to a friend&#039;s house and to move it to another location as soon as he gets it. No vendors here ask for signatures on package, so if ANY person asks you to sign for delivery of your package, DENY DENY DENY.<br /><br />It&#039;s also important to encrypt your address with PGP. If the vendor was a cop, this wouldn&#039;t make a difference. But&nbsp; if any third party ever gained access to the mail system within SR, you will feel like a dumbass if your name and address were floating among oh so many blatant felonies.<br /><br />You can also test what names work for mail at your house. Many vendors don&#039;t like fake names, but how would they know? They only ask for &quot;no fake names&quot; because many people are retarded and probably create some name out of thin air and their postman notices and doesn&#039;t deliver the package because it seems suspicious. Try establishing mail presences at your house...start getting ads and coupons sent to your house under a new name for a few weeks, then send a few packages of coffee. If they all get delivered you&#039;re probably good: You have a name that works and you have plausible deniability if any questions are asked regarding contraband packages because it wasn&#039;t sent to you, it was sent to Juan Gutierrez-Ramon, the ghost Mexican who was staying with you but just moved back to Juarez.<br /><br />This is just my advice, I&#039;d like to be corrected if I&#039;m off base.<br /><br />

For some shipping options it is mandatory. In fact for all NL to US mail, it is now required, regardless of the shipping method. There is no way around. So to say &quot;signing for it will get you popped&quot; - yeah, except when it is necessary. <br /><br />If your vendor packs your product well enough, then you will have no problems.<br /><br />Relax.
