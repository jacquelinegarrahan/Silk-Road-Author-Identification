				Is there much reason to worry about my anonymity if I am just buying prescription drugs (valium)?<br />I am anyway (that&#039;s the procedure) but if I was caught with a pocket of them (ten packs of ten) would it really be of interest to the police?<br />Isn&#039;t it a waste of time to arrest people who just want to stop having panic attacks so they can function more normally?<br /><br />I would say it&#039;s low risk, if not non risk. Agreed?

				That&#039;s what I thought. Might buy some cigarettes too. Save a fortune. Can&#039;t see me being executed for that either.<br />Made my first order today. It went smoothly. I&#039;m pretty confident they will turn up with a 100 rating.

				Oh another thing too. I&#039;m pretty sure I bought my last valiums by simply transferring money into a bitcoin account. So I&#039;ve cut out the middle man there....which has made me happy. They cost twice as much. I bet he&#039;s on this forum. Ha ha. Sorry pal.

				if you get caught with a bunch of prescription drugs that arnt yours it could be just as bad as getting caught with a completely illegal drug, because the way you acquired it was illegal, and it was illegal for whoever sold them to you to do so. so as far as police are concerned its just a drug deal, if you limit the amount you have on your person at any time though then you will not run into any problems, its not like police are running around college campuses stripping people down looking for anybody with an adderall pill on them and looking them up to make sure that they actually have a prescription, but lets say you get pulled over with a pill bottle full of Adderall and Vicodin with the label peeled off, you could be in a shit load of trouble

				If you&#039;re caught trying to receive Cigarettes in the mail (if you live in the U.S.), it&#039;s a felony I believe.

No smell, and is virtually undetectable unless you&#039;re specifically looking for it in a package. I stand by your statement. LSD is one of my favorites. Mainly because it&#039;s a nice clean trip each time.

				I guess it would depend how big a hard-on the LE official had for busting you. Many years ago I was hassled by LE for having an assortment of pills in a single vial. It turned out in that case they literally were all mine but combined into one place to make packing for a trip easier. They just kept questioning me like &quot;what&#039;s the name of the prescribing doctor?&quot; &quot;What are these prescribed for?&quot; The bottom line, as someone above said, is no matter how you slice it the drugs are the result of an illegal drug deal. Just imagine how much money we could save on taxes if we stopped this ridiculous &quot;war on drugs&quot;? But don&#039;t get me started on that. My advice is that you treat the purchase of Valium the same as any other drug. If you had a legitimate non-recreational need for them why not just get a script?
