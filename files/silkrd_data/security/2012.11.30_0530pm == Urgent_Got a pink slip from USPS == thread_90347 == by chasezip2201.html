				Hey guys for some reason i got one of those hey we missed you slips for one of my packages.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why it wasn&#039;t left because it doesn&#039;t require a signature, even according to the slip.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever gotten one of these 1 other time but it was for something legal so I just went and picked it up.&nbsp; <br />More info.<br />Tracking doesn&#039;t say its out for delivery even though I know it is because the tracking number is on the pink slip.<br />Last time I got one of these there was a 2 day delay before I could pick it up now it says it&#039;s avalaible about 2 hours after the delivery time for pickup.<br />Last time I went in for one of these even though there was no signature required I had to sign to get it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t care because it was legal but now I don&#039;t want to go in there and be like woah I/m not signing for this.<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				What size package were you expecting - do you think the package would have fit into your mailbox? A couple of weeks ago I received an over-sized package &amp; the &#039;order&#039; was for an ounce of weed;&nbsp; the vendor shipped in a giant priority mail box ...<br /><br />If I was expecting a letter or a letter-sized parcel no way in hell I would go and pick it up. <br /><br />Are you absolutely sure the USPS pink slip is for your SR package and not something else, like a Christmas or holiday package?&nbsp; Maybe ask around of close friends and family - see if anyone sent you some Christmas loot without telling you?&nbsp; Just trying to be helpful ~ good luck!!&nbsp; {inset hug}

				Wait a couple days to pick it up just to be safe.<br />If this were me I would find a stash spot not far outside the post office that I could hide it for awhile, and then drive around for an hour or 2 with nothing in your car and see if you get pulled over. If you do get pulled over and interrogated about the package tell them you threw it away because you didn&#039;t know what it was.

				Was it a domestic shipment?&nbsp; If so, I wouldn&#039;t go get it.&nbsp; If international, sometimes even though they check no signature the post office doesn&#039;t notice, or require sig anyway.&nbsp;

				If you got a pickup slip on international items even if it is not a signature required method, you will have to sign for it.<br /><br />With all the cutbacks to USPS, this is gonna happen alot more often. They are gonna do up racks of slips and just drop them off and have people go to locations and get their packages. CanadaPost does it in large cities and it works more effectively then having a mailman ring a couple dozen doorbells a day and finding out what they already know ... that no one is home during the day.<br /><br />IMO they aren&#039;t gonna bumrush and tackle you down in a post office when they have an address to actually deliver the package too. They do controlled deliveries in controlled environments

				I would buy a bigger mailbox. lol<br /><br />However, it seems you have to go sign so just get it over with.&nbsp; Return straight home and toss it in the trash for several hours or perhaps even a day or two.&nbsp;

Smart idea on having it redelivered, but DO NOT do something like altering your sig, as it implies that you know what&#039;s in that package. If you&#039;re gonna play it straight, play it straight. Hopefully your redelivery (plus porch instruction - great idea) works and you won&#039;t have to sign for a thing. Not sure how important this package can be compared to your freedom.

				If it is possible this happened because the package is too LARGE for the box as he stated, signing the slip and waiting for another delivery won&#039;t help, will it?&nbsp; Just scribble anything close on the form and don&#039;t forget to wear gloves if you can go that route.&nbsp; Denying signing it will be more difficult if your prints are on slip.

				Going for the redelivery is really a good idea and you&#039;re not putting yourself at more risk by going and signing for it. Then if it doesn&#039;t arrive and you get another slip you know there&#039;s something not quite right! Good luck hope you get your package safely.

				Send a friend to pick up the package - make sure he knows what&#039;s in it, and is cool with picking it up.<br /><br />If he&#039;s busted, he isn&#039;t even who the package is addressed to, so the police can&#039;t do shit.<br /><br />It also gives you time to get your shit together, like all the drugs and things you&#039;re using for SR out of your house etc etc...<br /><br />Just so if the worst has happened, the police aren&#039;t going to find anything incriminating on you, and you can deny everything - and then they can&#039;t do shit.

				Take a deep breath. The idea from Slicksuitm is good but if that is not an easy do then just go pick it up. Unless your expecting 10lbs of coke from someone named Pablo Escobar the police are not waiting around for you. I have been using the USPS for similar transactions for 30 years and more than likely it&#039;s due to package size or some other minor inconvenience for the mail service and they are doing you a favor by NOT leaving it at the door for you

That kid was stupid and blurted out a bunch of stuff but had they not been waiting for him he wouldn&#039;t have had the opportunity to be that stupid.<br /><br />That&#039;s not to say that this will happen to the OP. I&#039;m just getting awfully tired of &quot;I&#039;ve snorted coke off the brim of my postal carrier&#039;s hat and was totally fine&quot; kind of advice, when it runs directly contrary to publicized recent busts.

				You know, I never really understood why a signature means that you&#039;re automatically screwed and the cops now have perfect evidence against you. I mean if the postman came to my door and asked me to sign for a package, even if I had no idea what it was I&#039;d probably sign for it. Would the average person really say &quot;Sorry Mr. Postman, I&#039;m not expecting a package and therefore will not sign for one.&quot; No, the average person would probably be excited that they had received a random package and sign the damn form. I would just love for the postman to suddenly slap some handcuffs on me. Go ahead buddy, search my apartment, you&#039;ll find nothing incriminating. You want to go through my financial records and find the money that I supposedly spent? Good luck! You&#039;ll find nothing! So if I suddenly got handcuffed, I would act outraged and confused and scared, and play dumb the whole time. How the hell are they going to convict me of anything? As far as they know, someone sent drugs to me and I signed off just like anyone would. Nice try cop fuckers.
