				Perhaps this question might sound ungodly paranoid but would it be incredibly stupid (or just not recommended) for a SR user to buy drug paraphernalia (bong, stash jar, paper, vaporizer, etc) online for delivery to their home?<br /><br />Of course, the purchase itself would be legal but could this come back to possibly bite me later on?<br /><br />I already feel like an ass posing this question at all.

Personally, I&#039;d order without hesitation. Have you thought of just going to your local smartshop and buing a piece in person? I know it is usually 2x as expensive though.

				If your mail with drugs get stopped there may be an investigation where they look at your bank statement.&nbsp; Im not sure how much is needed before they look at it anyway, but I was asked by the police to give this up, I denied though.<br />Also, altho it sounds nice and most think its true, youre not really &#039;innocent until otherwise proven&#039;, atleast not where I am (in Scandinavia), its more like the opposite. If it seems likely enough that youre guilty, even with no solid evidence, you get prosecuted for it. I&#039;d think drug paraphernalia may be such a trigger in some cases.. especcialy if youre otherwise clean and have no connection to drugs.<br />Better buy in person with cash, or maybe some untraceable shipment from SR you could deny knowledge of anyway, even tho the chanse of it being a problem is prolly very small..

				I think it&#039;s fine. It&#039;s not like you&#039;re buying used stuff right? I mean you can always just say it&#039;s for tobacco.
