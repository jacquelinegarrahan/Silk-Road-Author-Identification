				i am european too. I have indeed managed to put paysafecards to neteller (about 2% fee) then to virvow(something like that with a fee) there you buy linden dollars i think with fee where with them you buy BTC with fees which then you are okay to go. all this cost me too much. I could say more than 30% in fees. Or you can go to bitcointalk forums and find someone to exchange for paysafecard, ukash, maybe otc or whatever. Be warned that most people want to scam you. Do your research. Buy in small portions maybe also. Buy from people with many posts and ratings. Again i believe you will pay about 10-15%&nbsp; :(<br /><br />dont want the btc for help :P But if you find a better way for converting euros to BTC send me a pm :P there is also a guide somewhere here with the above but it is too much fee i believe although guide stated it was only about 10%...&nbsp;

				Heya Herbal,<br />Intersango are ok as far as I can tell - it is the new name for Britcoin.<br />Im in the process just now of getting my first lot of BC from from them, and from investigation they certainly are legit.<br />I dont know if you have TSB banks in Ireland - if you do you can pay cash anonymously over the counter into there account and then buy bitcoin on there website.<br />Looking at there selling rates you always seem to be able to buy at the current exchange rate.<br />Im new on here but hope that helps you some.

				I got BTC from Intersango today. Just walk in to Lloyds, pay cash in to the account, and it&#039;s in Intersango ready to be used in 4-5 hours. So yeah, another thumbs up for them from me.<br />If you don&#039;t have any Lloyds, Mt Gox have a Barclays account you can pay cash/transfer to, but it takes about 36 hours to get the money to your account.<br />I think that&#039;s about it for us UK peeps with regards to getting BTC.
