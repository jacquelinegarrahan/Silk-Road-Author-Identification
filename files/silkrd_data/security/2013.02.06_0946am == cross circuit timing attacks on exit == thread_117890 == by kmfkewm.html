				essentially what this means is that when you exit Tor, it is probably not correct to look at individual circuits, but rather positions across circuits. Imagine that each attacker controlled node is a 1 and each good node is a 0. Normally any circuit other than 1x1 means that you are fine, but when you close out of Tor it is like each of the positions on each of the circuits bitwise or with the nodes on your other open circuits at the same position. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;001<br />|=____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 101 == compromised (exit traffic from circuits in pattern xx1 is linkable to you)<br /><br />this attack can also be used to break circuit isolation. Assume all letters are good nodes other than A which is attacker controlled node.<br /><br />BCA<br />DEA<br />FGA<br /><br />now you should already know that the controller of node A is capable of determining all of your exit traffic, but they can not trace you as the middle and entry nodes are good. However it is generally thought that the controller of node A is incapable of determining that traffic from node E C and G originates from the same entity, and thus there is per circuit traffic isolation. Well, on exit timing attack of circuit shut down packet probably can be used to link all three circuits together, and thus link all exit traffic from these circuits together to the same entity, breaking circuit exit traffic isolation.

				Nice kmf, always good to read your technical posts.<br /><br />I am a little confused though. In the next scheme :<br />&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;001<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;001<br />|=____<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 101 == compromised (exit traffic from circuits in pattern xx1 is linkable to you)&quot;<br /><br />One of those compromised nodes will know it&#039;s an exit node, but the other one how does he know he&#039;s an entry node and not a middle node? As far as I know a relay has no knowledge if you originated the data or you just passed them to him, right?<br />Did you put 2 compromised entry nodes for that reason, to narrow it down?<br /><br />Also does this apply to both clearnet and hidden service traffic?<br />Thanks

If they get a connection that isn&#039;t from a Tor relay it could be from a client or a bridge.

All the current research I have read points to a single packet being enough to utilize a timing attack, and thus I believe that this attacker could probably link the client to the hidden services IP address. Of course the attacker in this scenario will need to additionally identify the hidden services IP address, but as they are one of its entry guards they could just send the .onion address of interest a watermarked stream and wait to see if they observe themselves relaying that stream back to the hidden service they are an entry guard for. <br /><br />

				problem is that it is much more likely that two of your open circuits will fall into patterns<br /><br />GGC and CGG<br /><br />than it is that an individual circuit will fall into pattern<br /><br />CGC <br /><br />Tor devs are aware of this attack, they are going to research it further. One possible solution is to apply the circuit construction rules to ALL circuits rather than to individual circuits. Already you cannot use the same node at two positions on two different circuits, or two nodes from the same family on the same circuit for that matter. That said there are no rules regarding node selection across multiple circuits, and it is not rare to find that you have open circuits in the following pattern:<br /><br />GFG<br />GGF<br /><br />or even more worrying, <br /><br />FGG<br />GFG<br />GGF<br /><br />Where F == a node that is either the same node, or from the same family of nodes.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Interesting attack.<br /><br />Clients send most of their circuits through high bandwidth nodes, which maintain hundreds to thousands of simultaneous connections. So, what is the circuit close frequency on those nodes? If it is at least once per second, then a timing attack probably would not be effective. This also requires that your entry guard is pwned, and you cycle through them very slowly.<br />

As far as I am aware, the current research shows that a single packet is enough to link two parts of an observed stream together. There are millions of packets going across the Tor network at any given time but this does not prevent an attacker who can see only two packets from linking them together. For this reason I highly doubt that noise of other users exiting Tor will be enough to protect from this attack. Also it doesn&#039;t require compromised entry or middle node if it is used to compromise circuit isolation for exit traffic linking.

After you are done browsing sensitive web sites, do some mundane browsing for 15 minutes, then close your client. The attacker may be able to identity you, but you will be uninteresting.<br /><br />

				It does not matter if the circuit is still active , only that it is still open. So not closing out of Tor until the circuit used to exit to a sensitive site is no longer active will not help. Although perhaps you could manually close such circuits, surf for fifteen minutes, and then exit Tor.
