				Jesus the price has jumped up, I was last online before the weekend and it&#039;s jumped since then. <br />Satoshi is going to be a billionare, Guaranteed, because they make less and less BTC every year. <br /><br />£67 are you serious! =O I hope all vendors adjust prices accordingly

				Most vendors peg their prices to USD so prices automatically adjust.<br />It&#039;s stupidly high though isn&#039;t it, I&#039;ve seen a 900% increase in my 5 months on the road.<br />I&#039;m holding onto my coins as they are gaining so much value every day.

				It&#039;s wonderful. God only knows what kind of an end will this come to. I&#039;m pretty sure about the near future though: I&#039;m buying more... we got interesting things in the world right now: Bitcoin gaining value crazy fast, North Korea getting all loony - what would you add to the list?<br /><br />E: Oh, and I&#039;m also gonna learn Korean!

				Yes, It is insanely high now. But i suppose as long as the prices are adjusted then it doesn&#039;t make much of a difference how much you pay for them. 900% , People must be making millions. I mean seriously, Look at all the people on here who aren&#039;t exactly experts but know their way around basic scripting/coding, everybody on here has been saying for months that they are going up and you only had to check the rates to see it rise and rise. A smart investment in my opinion.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />North Korea have always been Loony,They&#039;re just getting worse, or we&#039;re just getting to see the extent of it now, How many people have ever been there? The press and media is very much suppressed there. All we see is what they show us really. One sign is the US moving troops out there on the sly, I guarantee special forces are in NK right now. <br /><br />There is all sorts of useless mindless bullshit going on in the world at the moment slowing us down , When we should be looking into progressing technology and space exploration as much as we can. <br />Currency is invented by the human race, to limit our expansion because of petty quarreling and bits of paper is plain stupidity to me.&nbsp; Of course one side of the coin is we need a structured system and currency helps that massively, But it also opens up doors to so much corruption it is unreal. We as a people could not adopt any other aspect of living without currency now, we are all to used to it, we would need to bring all children up into a world where it did not exist to introduce that way of life at an early age for it to make sense and work.
