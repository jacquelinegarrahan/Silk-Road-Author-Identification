				Since Dwolla stopped doing business with Mt. Gox a few weeks ago, I have been stranded hoping for a solution to my bitcoin dilemma.&nbsp; Just created my account on Coinbase today, and was instructed to wait for two deposits to show up.&nbsp; I am optimistic that this one will work and hold out and not go down the way the Dwolla/Mt. Gox thing did.&nbsp; Has anybody else had good experiences with them?&nbsp;

				There a legit company that plays by the rules. If you don&#039;t mind that they are a good company, only downside you have to wait 4 days for your coins. If your buying small amount of coins I wouldn&#039;t be worried using them rather than chance it with Bitinstant. Also Coinbase did get $5 million funding from VC so that makes me feel like they&#039;ll be here for awhile.

				Thanks, I think I will be going with them.&nbsp; It took 4 days to move bitcoin through Dwolla/Mt. Gox anyway, better to keep it all within one company and skip a step.&nbsp;

				You have to use a bank account, you have to wait days and it is not one bit anonymous.&nbsp; If you&#039;re okay with that then yes it is good for you.

				I have used them for about 6 transactions and 2 more pending at this moment and have had amazing results. I had a problem after my first transaction where my second was cancelled. Placed another transfer and emailed support. My next one went smooth and from then on I&#039;ve been happy. I&#039;ve learned to deal with the 5 day wait period by ordering every 3 days so ill have bitcoins already ordered before I need them. And I don&#039;t care about anonymos because bitcoins are not illegal and until they are im not to worried. And plus rhey are untraceble after they leave your wallet. Coinbase is so easy that I have not even thought about trying anywherre else. I have a really busy scedule working full time and college all year round don&#039;t have time to spend hours on the computer at a time. Coinbase takes me about three mins to make a buy. I just want my money and then my drugs with as little hastle as posible . I highly recommend them if you don&#039;t have to make huge btc purchases and need them fast.

				CoinBase is my fall-back. Like they said... easy, convenient, slow, and unanonymous. LocalBitcoins is also a good choice if you have a seller who accepts deposits at a bank in your area. Much faster and more anonymous than CoinBase.

SR has a tumbler built in but still. For small amounts it&#039;s not a big deal I think but just wanted to let you know.

Gox/Dwolla.&nbsp; Btcltd and licentia&#039;s coke here I come!&nbsp; Thanks everybody for the info.&nbsp;
