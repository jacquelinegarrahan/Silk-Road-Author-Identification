				I just did a 300$ transaction through bitinstant to my Silkroad wallet. i just deposited the money and now when i got home i tried to get onto silk road and it wont load the page. so my question is: will my coins still get transferred onto my on site wallet if silk road is down? will the coins still come through? im really worried! is anyone else having trouble getting on SR right now? any help would be much appreciated because im freaking out a little.

This happened a couple of times and they always sorted it out!

				Yes the number on your account is linked to your account, so it&#039;ll be there when SR is back up. If for some reason your bitcoin address was invalid it would just refund the bitcoins from where you sent it.

				I also had a sizable amount of BTC sitting in my account. This daily inflation was doing me well, I&#039;m hoping for the best.
