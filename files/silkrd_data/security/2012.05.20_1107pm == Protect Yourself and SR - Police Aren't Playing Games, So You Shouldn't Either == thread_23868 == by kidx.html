				I&#039;m sure many of you have heard of Stacy Litz. If not a simple Internet search should do the trick. <br /><br />To BRIEFLY summarize, and there&#039;s a lot there, Litz is a &quot;political activist&quot; who was involved in many facets of Libertarianism, and was very outspoken about ending the war on drugs. She also decided to become a confidential informant for the police when she was busted for selling MDMA and LSD to undercover cops. Litz bought her drugs off of the SR.<br /><br />The people who Litz set up were her friends, some of whom weren&#039;t even drug dealers. One person who was arrested based on Litz&#039;s snitching sold his personal Adderal after she begged him to do so. Only 3 people have been arrested based on Litz&#039;s informant work, but who knows how many more.<br /><br />The reason I bring this information up is not to stir up drama, although I encourage anyone who has information regarding Litz&#039;s Silk Road username or any other benefitial information to leave a comment on this thread. I started this topic because I believe that Litz is OBVIOUSLY not the type of person that anyone should be selling drugs to, especially not the quantity that were sold to her. I will explain why.<br /><br />1) Litz had 4000 Facebook friends. Someone with this much exposure should automatically be a red flag. Some may ask &quot;Why? Lots of people have lots of Facebook friends...&quot; I think it is important to distinguish between having &quot;a lot&quot; of Facebook friends and an excessive number of them. Personally, I don&#039;t use Facebook. I don&#039;t like announcing my every move, thought, and bowel movement to all my friends, family, and a handfull of strangers, and I don&#039;t like companies who build profiles on me and sell them to other companies that try to sell things to me. Someone with as many Facebook friends as Litz obviously talks too much. Having 4000 Facebook friends is a sign of carelessness and narcissism, and narcissist tend to believe that nothing will happen to them because of who they are, or something similar to that.<br /><br />2) Litz was a well-known political activist. She had no business dealing drugs. I know that many of you have strong political beliefs as well, and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. However, someone who starts organizations at their college, leads rallies, writes articles for newspapers that are politically dissenting of our government, is vocal on ending the war on drugs, goes on radio programs to talk about how to get involved with causes that fight the government, etc., shouldn&#039;t be surprised that she was being watched by either the local cops, federal government, big brother, or otherwise. What I&#039;m basically trying to say is that if you have strong political beliefs, either be involved with the underground movement or the mainstream movement, but not both. The Silk Road simply doesn&#039;t need this type of exposure. <br /><br />Now, I know that many of you might be thinking &quot;So what am I supposed to do, Google my customers and not sell to them if they have too many Facebook friends?&quot; Certainly not, but you should Google them to find out what information is available on them. Maybe you won&#039;t find much. Maybe you will find a ton of information. How many friends are too many? Well, I can&#039;t give a specific number, but I know that 4000 is too many for sure. But 500 may not be too many, as long as they weren&#039;t buying too much, and there arent&#039; any other red flags, I would worry about it. The point is to research them in the first place to get a feel of who they are.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to screw with anyone&#039;s revenue stream, and I know repeat customers who buy larger quantities are hard to find. But if we want Silk Road to exist into the near future, we have to take action to prevent this type of exposure. I mean GOD DAMN, this bitch is still all over the Internet posting blogs where she talks about Silk Road, and has recently gone on a radio program where both she and the host mention the Silk Road and buying drugs off of the Internet. Shit! Can we at least TRY not to announce this shit to the whole fucking world? She knows the cops are watching her, and she still is posting shit on the Internet? What will it take for this bitch to keep quiet? <br /><br />Anyways, I hope this helps. Tread softly my friends.<br />

				So vendors should attempt to find customers Facebooks, and then not sell to them if they have too many friends?&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly, how high are you right now?&nbsp; ::)

				This is a BAD idea. Vendors shouldn&#039;t be keeping their buyers names in any form. Much less GOOGLING them or checking their Facebook accounts! WTF!!!

Certainly don&#039;t &quot;keep&quot; your customers names...however, you can perform an Internet search without &quot;keeping&quot; their names. If you can&#039;t do that then I&#039;m not sure you should be selling on SR...

				its not the sellers responsibility. it doesn&#039;t affect them in any way to sell to idiots. silk roads time is limited regardless of how many stupid people buy from it. if you google &quot;silk r&quot; the first thing that pops up is step by step guides of how to get on. there is already so much publicity on this subject that there couldnt be much more lol.

				I am not going to lie, I will be vending fungus soon and It would bring peace of mind knowing I was selling to a adult at a residence and NOT mailing to a detectective or someone who is a leo. <br /><br />As for facebook friends, I could care less, and as for google I refuse to use it, but I will be using startpage on my buyers. I will only check it in tor in a fresh session.<br /><br />If the buyer is a 55yo government employ from washington dc, sorry but you are Sol buddy.

				All this says to me is that SR has the rules it does to protect everybody involved, and it works best if everyone follows them.&nbsp; If the seller isn&#039;t stupid, they are 100% anonymous, and the only risk they carry is transporting the packaged items to a post office dropoff.&nbsp; The buyer assumes the only actual risk in the SR transaction, which is handing over their real name and address to what could be an LEO and possibly a controlled delivery.<br /><br />Sellers, don&#039;t keep record of your sales.&nbsp; It becomes evidence to screw both you and your customers, so delete that shit pronto.&nbsp; Outside of that, all the seller needs to do is to drop off their product at a range of post offices and try not to get pulled over and searched in the process.&nbsp; It ain&#039;t that hard.
