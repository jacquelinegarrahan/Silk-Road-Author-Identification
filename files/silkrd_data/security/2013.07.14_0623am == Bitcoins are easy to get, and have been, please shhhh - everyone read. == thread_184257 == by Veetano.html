				I have gotten really tired of reading all these posts about how bitcoins are impossible to get and what not, etc, bla bla bla...<br /><br />Sorry to be rude but bitcoins are easssy as fuck to get if you know where to look, even now... I could go get $10,000(even up to 20-30k per transaction) worth in 5-10 minutes on Monday, or any other day, no hassle. The problem is so few people know of these methods because they are not willing to put in the time and research to learn about the various sites, such as some P2P sites. They don&#039;t bother to learn, or talk to people in the bitcoin community. I probably spent 200+ hours of research and attempting to learn and get familiar with these various sites/trusted btc hookups before I was confident in my ability to get them. <br /><br />Needless to say... there are a lot of people I have talked to in the bitcoin community, who sell from their personal stash of 2000-15000+ bitcoins, at rates of 5-8%. Yeah, that&#039;s a lot of fucking coins, they are rich as fuck, sort of. There are actually quite a lot of people like that out in the bitcoin community and they make a lot of money, many of them are MORE than willing to help newbies out...<br /><br />For instance, one thing these people do are(or get another rich person to do), go to an auction and buy $20,000-200,000 worth of bitcoins at a time, totally legally, as low as 0.05%.... and then they sit on them for a long ass time and just flip them at rates of 5%-10%. I talked to one guy who just sits at his computer all day(sort of) watching his bank deposits and setting up transactions. He moves so many bitcoins he makes close to $2000-4000 profit per day, just sitting there doing nothing. <br /><br />The great thing about bitcoins is these people can share you their wallet address, to show you their coins so you know they&#039;re legit, and often they have a reputation behind them depending on the community. Many of the folks I ended up talking to have specialized bitcoin addresses that contain their internet name in it, that they mined on their own. For instance if I had one it could be 1VeetanoMALfNDrYdTD2ACtHdqg4Xte7iktG or something like that. These people are out there, WAITING for you to come buy coins from them. They have so many coins scamming wold literally be the stupidest thing on earth the could possibly do, so the risk is minimal.<br /><br />Okay so you read all this, now what....? Well, I&#039;m certainly not going to tell you my sources/people. Hopefully this has given you some incentive to do a little bit of research and have faith. Bitcoin is far from dying. The demand is there, and obviously the supply is there. If the supply wasn&#039;t there then there wouldn&#039;t be a demand! Just be careful with your research, talk to people, exercise caution, THINK SOBER(OR SMART RATHER). <br /><br />Vendors, if you didn&#039;t infer from all this information, many of these people are also able to cash out, lots of coins. I know one vendor(not personally), who cashes out $30,000 per week in coins through one of the guys that I buy my coins from, he more or less sends his coins and the BTC seller overnights him a package of cash...trust...trust....trust....bitcoin is thriving. Don&#039;t work with those stupid companies with their stupid websites. That mask of professionalism doesn&#039;t go smoothly with bitcoin. Bitcoin is a p2p currency and the smoothest, easiest, and most stress free transactions you will ever have will be with individuals. Be smart, stay safe, and I shouldn&#039;t have to say this next part but don&#039;t ever say, or even hint to the SilkRoad, outside of the SilkRoad, never to these bitcoin pros. You don&#039;t know who they are and most of them are trying to stay as legal as possible. They don&#039;t want any illegal/suspicious connection to them what so ever... <br /><br />I am in fact flying out of state next week to personally meet one of these bitcoin bosses who supposedly has enough money to chance having over $4million in bitcoins laying around. We&#039;ve done so much business together, I&#039;m actually going to go have dinner with his/her family, and talk about economics and what not. It is up to the bitcoin community to keep it alive, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it.

				If you read that entire thing and didn&#039;t gain a whole lot of insight then you need to look again. There are people with TONS of coins out there looking to sell them, very trustworthy people with a big reputation, all over public bitcoin trading forums, p2p bitcoin trading sites, etc.... the entire point of my &quot;essay&quot; was to stress the importance of communications. Bitcoins are very easy to get, you just have to talk to people, and exhaust your options... <br /><br />I guess the reason I have such an easy time obtaining bitcoins and an easy time on the road is because I will send out over 10-20+ messages per day all to different people, whether to vendors or bitcoin sellers, when I am looking for answers to a question I might have, or looking for a source of something. <br /><br />What 5 people might not be able to tell you, 1 person might. You can never know if you don&#039;t ask, and it never hurts to ask. Reach out, you will find very trustworthy and legit bitcoin sources, I can assure you. The main reason I don&#039;t give out my source, is because it would not be very polite to my &#039;connection&#039; to splather his name on this forum while he tries to maintain his legal upstanding. I feel I have given as much information as I can without pissing any particular bitcoin vendors off....good luck... enjoy... and you&#039;re welcome.

				Veetano is right... and it&#039;s good he didn&#039;t reveal too much specifics. We need people on the road who are smart about what they do, not immature kids who can&#039;t figure simple things like this out. If you&#039;re smart enough to figure these sorts of things out, then good, you deserve to be here.

				TLDR: Individual bitcoin pioneers, early miners and traders, are scattered about the world with large stores of BTC that they actively trade on. By navigating to a proper forum, by participating in the community of BTC, you may hunt for coin dealers with extensive reviews and strong incentives for good business. <br /><br />&nbsp;Here are two very simple places to start: Localbitcoins.com.... Bitcointalk.org. <br />&nbsp;

				I may be playing captain obvious here, but coinbase is incredibly easy to use. I am allowed to purchase up to 10btc per day, if I wanted. It was easy, not very time consuming, and although it takes fucking forever, they are reliable, and their fees are most reasonable. <br /><br />Now, getting btc for free, that is another entity entirely. Hooking comes to mind, although the cost in dignity and self respect is not worth it to me or mine.

				I wouldn&#039;t whine so much about the % of their take for conversion.&nbsp; It would obviously vary between private sellers, and exchanges charge fees as well.&nbsp; When I have to buy coins for a purchase, I always buy 10-25% more than I need, to account for market fluctuations and all the little nibbles each exchange and tumbler takes from me.
