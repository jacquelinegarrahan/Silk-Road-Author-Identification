				Mavrick I&#039;m&nbsp; new to using SR too. The peeps who commented above are right. A little learning and some perseverance will pay off. And obtaining bitcoin is probably&nbsp; the easiest (although somewhat nerve racking) part of the process. I used Bitpiggy and got my Bitcoin within 24hours. Now I&#039;m waiting for the BTC to arrive in my SR wallet....

				Yes i understand the whole concept , its like ebay , yes i get it , but im just so freaking scared to fuck up and not do things right , like for example , where do i buy bitcoins with a prepaid credit card ? and where do i get a good e wallet to put it in ? i looked around and the one place that everyone likes seems to suck now , so im stuck , if you guys want to sit her and just troll than just fuck off , im asking for help , not sarcasm&nbsp; , not everyone can understand how to do all things fast , maybe you guys understand how to guide yourselves thru the darknet , but i don&#039;t , i bet there are many things that im better at doing than most people on here like taking a whole engine apart and putting it back together , or figuring out chemical properties of many of the drugs that your buying on here , its not that i cant figure it out , its the fact that i like to party , but in nyc the drugs suck here and i have a lot to loose if something happens , i just would like to get it right , every time i read something about moving forward in doing my purchase there&#039;s another topic telling me that that method has loop holes and sucks

				Its all here on the forums is what im saying. You have the access because you&#039;re already here. There is always going to be new teks and procedures that people come out with, and everyone thinks his or her method for operating anonymously is better than the next guys. Its a matter of preference. You have to chose what preference you want to use and then go do it. <br /><br />Everything you need can be found with a little thing called the search bar. <br /><br />

All those methods have minor caveats, but are infinitely better than using a bank transfer or credit card to obtain bitcoin.

				regarding the bitcoins, just keep a lot of them handy. learn everything you can about bitcoins.<br /><br />i&#039;d also read about similar technologies such as OpenTransactions and such, just so you have a very solid grounding in the technology, but you dont REALLY need to do that in order to simply buy from silkroad.<br /><br />what you do need to know how to do, is how to buy bitcoins anonymously.<br /><br />is there a public wifi near you?<br /><br />use a mcdonalds or starbucks wifi with one of those unused laptops, and connect to mtgox and bitinstant.<br /><br />create throwaway accounts there (do not use tor, use the public wifi!) and act like nothing is suspicious.<br /><br />THEN, once you are done buying your bitcoins (more detailed instructions are in the sticky thread at the top of this forum) you need to launder them, you can just use several insta-wallets (again, more detailed instructions elsewhere in this forum) to obscure your trail in the blockchain.<br /><br />then deposit your bitcoins in your silkroad bitcoin address to have them credited toward your account.<br /><br />then you can chat with several vendors to see what you need to do to prove yourself.<br /><br />personally, i&#039;d use TAILS (a special version of linux just for this sort of thing) and connect to the SILC chatroom, and ask about it.<br /><br />if you dont know how to connect to the SILC chatroom using TAILS, and are unwilling to learn how, then you probably shoudnt even be here.<br /><br />you are going to learn about computer security really fast, so be prepared.

				Honestly, I&#039;m not too experienced since I&#039;ve only made one purchase but, for a newbie, it&#039;s fairly easy to figure out if you read the forums.&nbsp; Simplest way is find a bitcoin vendor, get a moneypak, get your coins, choose the vendor you want to work with, then figure out where you can get it shipped to safely.&nbsp; Those are your basic steps for a beginner buyer, I&#039;d say.&nbsp; But I&#039;m no expert.

				I&#039;m a newbie as well and yes there is a lot to take in. However I&#039;m really learning a lot which was an unintended consequence in my search for err... &quot;Lipitor&nbsp; :D &quot;. So all of the elbow-grease involved in making my first purchase has been very worthwhile in terms of the stuff I learned most of which is not necessarily specific to procuring &quot;Lipitor&quot;.<br /><br />There is so much information here and the senior and IT savvy people seem to be very generous and patient in helping us newbies out. So thanks to those guys/gals!

				It is a lot to take in, but we all had to do this...first learn a bit of basic Tor just to get here, then figure out just how much you want to protect yourself, which can mean using a linux OS, like Tails or Liberte or Privatix...I always suggest people do what I&quot;ve done myself just recently, which is start at the *beginning* of this thread here, the &#039;Security&#039; thread, as if you take a couple of hours and do that, you&#039;ll find out all the things we sorted out, and the different ways of approaching your security.&nbsp; After using different virtual machines, and privatix and liberte, I&#039;ve actually gone back to Tails, as it &#039;keeps me honest&#039; and all my passwords and pgp keys I keep stashed in a cloud website, similar to dropbox.<br /><br />To purchase, you need to acquire bicoins.&nbsp; There are all kinds of ways to do that, and take a little time, and look around the threads.&nbsp; I&#039;ve ised TRadeHill, and getbitcoins.com...TH went under, but now, like many others, I just purchase from one of the online vendors, tho here you do need to study up a bit, so you don&#039;t get ripped off: there is absolutely *no* protection buying them from online vendors, so reputation is everything...but it doesn&#039;t take much reflection to realize that you don&#039;t have really any protection buying from outside vendors, as they can go under to, and when TradeHill went under it took me weeks to retrieve my funds.&nbsp; Online vendors that I know have always treated me honest are btcKing, btcBuddy, and btcPal.&nbsp; SugarMama also has good reputation...but again, you need to look at the threads, and keep up to date.<br /><br />Depending on what drug you like, there is bound to be a thread on it, where people post their experiences.&nbsp; I trust these more than the feedback you see on main site.<br /><br />So, get to studying, not that hard to get this shit figured out, at least to a degree where you&#039;ll be comfortable...but we can&#039;t do the work for you, as we had to learn all this ourselves also....<br /><br />best wishes...<br /><br />pbb
