				&nbsp;<br />A man has been jailed for two years after signing for a package containing €20,000 worth of cannabis.<br />Customs officials intercepted a package of cannabis posted in Germany and made a controlled delivery of it to an address in Cork, where a man signed for it. <br /><br />Gardaí obtained a warrant and arrested Roy Cambridge, aged 20, at 22 Mangerton Close, The Glen, Cork, on Feb 16. <br /><br />Det Garda Edmund O’Donoghue said customs officers became suspicious of the package addressed to a name other than Cambridge, but to his address. <br /><br />An officer from the customs service delivered the package which was signed for at the address. <br /><br />Cambridge subsequently pleaded guilty to having the drugs for sale or supply. <br /><br />Judge Seán Ó Donnabháin said: “The appropriate sentence is two years.”

				May I be so bold as to ask you Harmreduction. Do you actually participate in the old taking of drugs? Or do you spend your time scaremongering. ?

				It says there that they only got suspicious because the name was different on the mail than what was registered on the address, and then he&nbsp; actually signed it. If he had used his real name and signed it, he probably could have gotten away with it. &quot;I sign all the packages I receive, it might be important.&quot;<br /><br />Another reason to not use &quot;Ronaldo the Methhead&quot; as your name on orders.
