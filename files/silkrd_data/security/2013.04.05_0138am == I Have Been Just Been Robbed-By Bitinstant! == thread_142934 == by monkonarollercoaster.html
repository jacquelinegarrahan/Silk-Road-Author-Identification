				Now I will express my beef with BitInstant. One time, a transaction didn&#039;t go through. I emailed them, and they charged an extra 1% or 2% fee just for fixing the problem (which was an error with THEIR system on THEIR end.) They definitely are some money hungry jews in that respect. If your buying BTC doesn&#039;t go smooth, and if they have to get involved, they&#039;ll try to wring a few extra dollars out of you. <br /><br />But if things go well, then things aren&#039;t so bad. OP, if you&#039;re buying thousands of $$ in BTC, I really don&#039;t think BI is the way to go about it.. I mean, their interest rate alone is taking around $4 per $100, right? Not to mention that if your problem mentioned in the original post were legitimate, then they&#039;re be charging an extra 1% to 2% on top of that, so at this amount of cash, they&#039;re banking in on your incompetence.

				I have emailed, called, and opened a support ticket but these have all essentially been ignored by bit instant either off the bat of just after the initial response which was always &quot;we will be in touch soon&quot; (simply no follow through). <br /><br />&nbsp;I also opened a ticket with Mt Gox which was attempted to be closed since they perceive themselves as having no responsibility despite it was going to be deposited directly so I reopened that ticket.. <br /><br />@Bart that is the limit if you pay cash.. other transactions cal be made for $1-2000 at once and if you have paid attention to the market you would understand why I wanted to to do that as well as why I opened exchange and funding accounts which are waiting for approval since every one else has opened them too.

				<br />For future reference bitfloor is awesome. They allow cash deposits at the bank and i don&#039;t believe they have a limit.(possibly in the 10,000 range.)

				Lol I have nothing what so ever to do with bitinstant. <br /><br />These fear threads are getting old. What happens is people go to sketchey sources because of threads like this and get scammed for real.<br /><br />If I read your post right, you spread out your deposits over time. If the first one got screwed up then why for the love of god would you make another.<br /><br />If you are real than go to the forum like scout suggested. Folks there do seem to get more attention and faster results. <br /><br />If you are for real than bitinstant will figure out what happened and fix it.

There is bitfloor but I don&#039;t have a BofA near me to try it. <br /><br />Perhaps your right and it wasn&#039;t a trol thread.

				Let me add my voice to the OP&#039;s. <br /><br />I made a transaction for 100$ on January 22, and still have not received my funds. Nor have I heard back from Bitinstant support. If Bitinstand does fix this for me, I wonder what rate they will use for Bitcoin purchase. <br /><br />I have had this happen before with Bitinstant last October. They did fix it after 6 weeks. I am definitely searching for a better way.&nbsp; :-\

				Best thing to do...Go on Bitcontalk, newbie thread, there should be a sticky with Bitinstant troubleshoot...Looks like they hired a new guy just to help handle issues and see to be moving quite fast...Just have your info posted on there and problem..By the looks of it though , everyone is having the same problem you are and it might take a while...I&#039;ve been where you are and it was BS..Ask them to waive the transfer fee&#039;s..Thousands of dollars can save you some money.

				OP how long ago was this transaction? I have done around 4-5 transactions with bitinstant and NEVER have received Bc in 1 hour as stated. I email them over and over, no replies... But eventually (when convenient for them) they always send me an email back apologizing for the wait, the longest It&#039;s taken is 5 business days. They are a legit service, just not very professional. Good luck though, hope everything works out It sucks to get scammed =(

				Way to go instilling confidence in the Bitcoin community guys with all these scare threads.<br />I have nothing to do with Bitinstant or any of these services but I see a simple solution to avoid any risk if it worries you-<br />Use a local wallet that runs on your PC/Mac/Server and buy your coin directly of reputable traders either face to face or by bank wire.<br />If you do this then you are always in full control of all your funds and I for one wouldnt have it any other way, especially when we are talking about larger sums of money (5,000-10,000 etc) - fuck trusting anyone with that amount of money if it can be avoided.<br />I think the beauty of Bitcoin is how &quot;hands on&quot; it can be, the fact that there is no need for any middle men or any banks or institutions.<br />TL;DR - If your worried about Bitinstant have you considered not using bitinstant?

				I use SpendBitcoins and they have been great!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />They often have coins in my wallet within &lt;3hrs of a cash deposit .. they say &#039;after 2pm it will be the next day&#039;<br />BUT<br /><br />Last week I deposited cash at the nominated nabk about 3:15 pm and they were in my account in 90 mins&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />They are Oz based but I believe they trade all currencies&nbsp; :-\

				I don&#039;t spend much time there, so I can&#039;t recall off the top of my head, but there is a long, long thread where people still haven&#039;t gotten their coins after weeks of waiting.&nbsp;

I have only ever had problems with BI once, and the OP obviously (if their story is accurate) used it for a far larger amount than for it was intended to be used. If you don&#039;t mind paying a 4% fee (on your dollar amount, not a 4% against your btc!) and you&#039;re not trying to buy $10,000 in Bitcoins then bitinstant is a quick, usually smooth service. I have always had my coins within 1 hour. Honestly usually within 20 to 40 minutes. The only exception being when something went wrong with my transaction, which, accidents happen.<br /><br />I encourage you to use other options that people talk about, such as bitfloor. But don&#039;t completely rule bitinstant out. If there&#039;s a Moneygram nearby, you can literally have bitcoins within 45 minutes. But as with everything on Tor and SR, use caution and be cognitive of your privacy and security. Don&#039;t be afraid to ask around if you have questions. But don&#039;t let this thread scare you.

				I have now been waiting over 48 hours for a measly $400 deposit.&nbsp; I have sent 5 emails, and opened a support ticket but have received ZERO communication from BitInstant.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting tempted to take a bus to New York and run up on their office demanding $400 in cash.<br /><br />I will never, EVER, use BitInstant again.
