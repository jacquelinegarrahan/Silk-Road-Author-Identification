				So, I&#039;m a noob here and I&#039;m on the cusp of my first purchase.&nbsp; I bought my coins today through BlueSkyTraders and had them deposited into my wallet at Blockchain.info.&nbsp; I then chose the &quot;send money&quot; tab, selected the &quot;Quick Send&quot; copy/pasted my SR wallet address into the &quot;To:&quot; slot (and then double and triple checked to confirm they were the same) and then entered the amount I wanted transferred and hit &quot;send payment&quot;.&nbsp; I immediately got a notice that said my transfer was low priority and that it could take awhile, though I could help speed things up my providing a small payment to the miners, which I declined to do (I figured I could wait).&nbsp; After I declined, the window disappeared and I went to the &quot;my transactions&quot; tab to see if the transaction was listed.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t, and the coin was (and as of the moment, still is) still in my wallet.&nbsp; It&#039;s been about 1.5-2 hours since I did this.&nbsp; I have a feeling that there is nothing to be concerned about, especially since my coin is still showing up in my&nbsp; wallet, but I wanted to know a few things about the process: will the transaction not appear in &quot;my transactions&quot; until the miners get around to it, that is, will it only show up once the money is in my SR wallet?&nbsp; I realize that the notification I received when I made the transaction said the transaction was low priority and could take a while, so I&#039;m fine with waiting, but I was expecting some sort of notification that the transaction was pending.&nbsp; Just hoping someone can explain this to put my mind at ease.

				I don&#039; t know if you got an answer to this but in case you haven&#039;t, and for the benefit of those looking at the question, the short non-techy answer to this is that not all e-wallets behave the same when it comes to showing your BTC deposit. Before any transaction is considered truly verified it needs at least 6 confirmations from the &quot;network&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some e-wallets, like SR for example, wait until they receive all 6 confirmations before showing you that your BTC &#039;s have been deposited and you can spend them straight away.<br />Other e-wallets, like Instawallet, show you that the BTC &#039;s have been deposited straight away, but will not allow you to spend them until the remaining network confirmations have been received. I am sure people with far better knowledge&nbsp; could explain this better, but in layman&#039;s terms, that is about the gist of it.<br />The time it actually takes to get the 6 (or more) confirmations depends on a number of things like how busy the network is, the speed of your machine, the relative humidity..............I am sure you get the idea!<br />If it gets to over 3 hours and there is no disclaimer saying it make take upto X hours before your BTC show in your wallet, then I would start to ask question (i.e.panic but not panic if you see what I mean)<br />Hope this helps.

				Thanks for the response!&nbsp; My case may not be typical: the coins remained in my wallet on Blockchain.info, no transaction was shown and I was unable to attempt another &quot;send&quot; for 24 hours.&nbsp; I tried again the next day and that time the coins transferred to my SR wallet within the space of 30 minutes.&nbsp; Not entirely sure what happened the first time (someone with more knowledge about this sort of thing might have an idea) but my coins never left my wallet, just were sort of locked in place.&nbsp; But, now they&#039;ve been moved into my SR wallet and I&#039;ve begun my first experience with the Road!&nbsp; Again, thanks for the response!
