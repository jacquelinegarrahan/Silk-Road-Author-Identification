				I hate to sound paranoid, but as we know, Nomad is MIA - last active November 16? So, I went to find DigitialAlch to delete a topic thread I had started. He/She hasn&#039;t been active since November 14.<br /><br />Where the hell are the moderators? And is it coincidental they&#039;re both missing?

				well, you don&#039;t necessarily sound paranoid, you sound concerned. <br /><br />If the worst case scenario might be true, I would take a moment and delete everything in your inbox and outbox in these forums. That may or may not make them go away in the dB though. You should not have the same username in the forums and the marketplace, and if you do, you should DEFINITELY not have the same password for both sites. So change your pw at the market if it&#039;s the same here (forums) and at SR.<br /><br />Since the mods rarely censor the message threads (SR is good at policing itself) maybe they decided to have a little company &quot;meeting&quot; in the Caribbean, or who the hell knows.<br /><br />I&#039;m online ALOT (I don&#039;t mean here), yet, there are times during the year that I just need to walk away from my projects and only respond to the most essential communication. Major holidays that I&#039;m visiting family I haven&#039;t seen for awhile, for instance.<br /><br />I cannot necessarily anticipate what the possible ramifications might be if the forum moderator&#039;s accounts are compromised. The basics of protecting yourself here (forums) is NEVER send an address connected to you via PM in the forums.<br /><br />If you are a seller pushing weight, DO NOT USE THE SAME USERNAME HERE AS YOU DO IN THE MARKETPLACE. you&#039;re exposing yourself to being &#039;triangulated&#039;.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal - once SR is compromised (ie: admin accounts are 0wn3d by LE) it is too late to regret basic security protocols you compromised. <br /><br />Stay vigilant, even when everything is going great and you feel like nothing could possibly go wrong. My guess is that there are guys in cheap suits in unmarked brick buildings in front of multi monitor displays who never even TRIED weed, obsessively looking for pieces of a puzzle that might lead them to you. <br /><br />Oh, and by the way, I know the mods are probably going to pop up here and say &#039;Guys, chill out, holy shit, take a benzo and stop having anxiety attacks ...&#039; but remember, only the paranoid will survive. Once LE brings the hammer down on SR in a coordinated multi departmental multi state online &#039;raid&#039;, you either have your back against the wall or you slip out the back door while everyone else is trapped.<br /><br />Just my 2cents, take it for it&#039;s worth, Cheers,<br /><br />lordbritish
