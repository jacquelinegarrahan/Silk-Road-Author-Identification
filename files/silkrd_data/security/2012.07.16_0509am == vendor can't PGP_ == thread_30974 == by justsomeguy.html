				I&#039;m trying to order from a reputable vendor who says they&#039;re having trouble reading my encrypted address.&nbsp; He said his PGP often doesn&#039;t work, and he doesn&#039;t know how to fix it.&nbsp; I&#039;m firmly against sending my address unencrypted or via privnote, but I don&#039;t know how to solve this issue.&nbsp; The vendor and I both have time constraints, and I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to put much effort into getting it to work before then.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had any issues with PGP, so I&#039;m not sure how he could fix it anyway.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do to get my address to him securely?

				Not without PGP. <br /><br />Ask him to send you his private key again and try once more.<br /><br />To be honest, i&#039;d just use Privnote or just send in plain text.<br /><br />You&#039;re not protecting government secrets - it&#039;s just an address.

				The vendor says he is computer illiterate, so I&#039;m not sure he could handle OpenSSL.&nbsp; I think just getting his PGP working would be a challenge.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never heard of it &quot;not working sometimes,&quot; it&#039;s a pretty simple process.&nbsp; I decrypted the message I sent to him with my password and it worked fine.&nbsp; I definitely selected his name when encrypting it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what else to do.&nbsp; What could be going wrong?<br /><br />I know Privnote is not secure at all.&nbsp; I won&#039;t use it or send plaintext.&nbsp; But I&#039;m getting desperate, and if I can&#039;t sort it out very soon, the window of opportunity will be gone and I won&#039;t be able to get my product.
