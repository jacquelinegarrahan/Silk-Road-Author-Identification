				hey guys i need your help, i need my comp clean and im no i.t genius.. im thinking of just reformatting it but will that still leave traces of SR activity or even my username on here? also would windows 7 and all essential programs still be on it? what should i do.. i would go into more personal details and recent events but probably best not to this week. Thanks guys, really appreciate any advice. Also the house isn&#039;t clean ive got a draw full off most psychedelics available but im comfortable in risking that being for personal use.

				Formatting will not do enough, you need to zero out the hard drive. Use a program like http://killdisk.com/ or something similar.

				I&#039;d use Truecrypt (I use it myself) to encrypt the whole partition, that way you don&#039;t need to delete anything (you wouldn&#039;t need to delete anything related to SR if you&#039;re using Tor browser. The existance of the Tor browser itself is meaningless to anyone).<br /><br />For plausible deniability, use Truecrypt to create a hidden volume. Whilst law enforcement in some countries might punish you for refusing to give a password for your system, they can&#039;t punish you for a hidden volume since they can&#039;t ever prove it exists.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Personally I haven&#039;t bothered with the hidden volume. I just encrypted my drives. If ever questioned I&#039;ll just claim the password is super complex, and the stress of being arrested plus the time passed has caused me to forget it, so tough noogies.<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Dban sounds neat. But it&#039;s not needed if you&#039;ve used Truecrypt. Infact I&#039;d consider Truecrypt safer, because some people claim that you need to format a drive X times to completely erase everything (my apologies if Dban overwrites the harddrive with several passes, I am not familiar with the program).

				Reformatting doesn&#039;t permanently delete all data and is still recoverable even after multiple reformats. Like stated above, Dban is a good option to destroy all data on the HDD. Dban uses 3 passes to permanently delete all data from the drive. There is no way to recover any of it, maybe bits (and I mean bits) of info but those bits (1&#039;s and 0&#039;s) would be scrambled and overwritten to the extent that it is impossible to gather any sort of valuable information from it. it would look like a fresh hard drive. Use Dban to clean your drive and then use truecrypt to encrypt it for good security if your drive happened to be confiscated before you can use Dban.

But, the residual data that is left over is just that: residual data. It has no incriminating value and could not possibly be used as evidence. Of course, the only way to be 100% safe is to physically destroy the hard drive and buy a new one. In a pinch, a very powerful magnet might do the trick but would not be as safe as a hammer or 600+ degree heat.

				DBAN! Very easy to use software. Go to the website, burn the .ISO image to a cd, and then boot from CD.<br /><br />Configure it to overwrite the entire disk with just 1 pass, this will suffice. Then reinstall the operating system.

That is why SSD&#039;s are becoming more popular. Using the command that is built in to most ATA and all newer drives is faster, depending on the level of security you want. Either choice would be good for wiping data, with the winner going to hardware level deletion only because it&#039;s slightly faster.

Simply burn the .iso to a disc and boot from that disc. Here are the steps:<br /><br />1. Download and burn dban to disc.<br />2. Place disc in drive and restart computer.<br />3. When the BIOS screen flashes (the first screen that comes up before loading your OS) go into boot options/menu. (on my computer its F12 but it might be different with different BIOS&#039;s)<br />4. Select the disc drive that you put the disc into.<br />5. After a few seconds a blue screen will come up. This is the Dban software.<br />6. Type in &#039;autonuke&#039; and press enter. (this will do 3 passes, not just 1)<br /><br />That&#039;s it! After 5-8+ hours depending on the size of your HDD it will be completely erased and nothing can be retrieved from the HDD. Be sure to backup any files you want to save and have an OS disc to install after dban erases your hard drive. Dban will erase everything including all operating systems you have on the hard drive.

The CD is telling the computer what to do, not the OS. This is logical, because you&#039;re about to completely wipe all data on the hard drive, including the operating system. <br /><br />extra pro-tip: when DBAN is started, don&#039;t type autonuke. As stated above, that command will completely overwrite everything with 3 passes of data. However, that is more than necessary, 1 pass of data is sufficient.<br /><br />3 passes will take a lot of time (we&#039;re talking hours here) and is just a waste of electricity and wear on the hardware. After one pass of data, it already is extremely hard to recover any data. Very advanced forensic equipment is necessary for that, and nobody is gonna spend that kind of time/money/effort (unless you&#039;re the leader of some terrorist network). Also, if you continue to use your hard disk after wiping, the bits will get overwritten again, making it even harder to recover anything.<br /><br />When entering DBAN, press enter. This will take you to advanced mode, a self explanatory interface where you can configure DBAN to overwrite the disk with 1 pass of random data. (I believe there are also youtube tutorials out on the subject).

The command line is less intuitive because many newbies don&#039;t even know what MS-DOS or terminal-like programs are let alone know how to type in commands. That is the reason I recommended dban to the OP. However, if the OP is at least somewhat confident in their computer knowledge and can type commands into MS-DOS, then hardware level deletion would be the ideal way to do this.

However there is more risk involved. If you wipe the entire disk, you can be sure every nook and cranny is wiped. If you do a free space wipe, you have to trust that the software is thorough. Also, if you accidentally forgot to delete a file, then that disk space is not going to be wiped.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28489.msg328960#msg328960">Quote from: CurlyG on July 06, 2012, 08:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">how many passes would one want to do to be &quot;safe&quot; from anyone seeing any SR history?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well the keyword here is &quot;anyone&quot;. <br /><br />If you wipe with 1 pass, all data will be destroyed. You won&#039;t be able to get it back, no matter what software you use. It will be impossible to recover the original content. For you, for the computer repair shop, for the police, for the computer factory, everybody.<br /><br />With one exception. There are special laboratory techniques that can be used to see what data was on the disk before it was overwritten. This requires the device to be taken apart and investigated very carefully by computer forensics using specialized equipment. I presume this is a very time consuming and expensive process. If you think somebody is going to use that on your disk, as a Silk Road buyer (or vendor for that matter) then you are in fantasy land.<br /><br />However, if you want to eliminate that possibility, you can overwrite your disk several times with random data. There are several patterns and algorithms out there. The US department of defense uses 3 passes. This is generally accepted as absolutely safe. The CIA uses 7 passes. A certain computer scientist, Peter Gutmann proposed a method of 35 passes, and it is included as an option on many software (including DBAN and CCleaner). However this takes very long (for a regular 1TB disk, something like a week), and it is generally considered nothing more than a good way to toast your hard disk. Even Gutmann himself admitted it is overkill.<br /><br />I use 1 pass for basically everything, and 3 passes if I really want something gone. I consider everything more than 3 passes useless and excessive wear on my hardware.

				I think its worth noting that as much as I love DBAN, it does have a potential weakness. I could be wrong here but as far as I know it does not write over bad sectors on the disk, which could contain incriminating evidence if it went bad after data was written to it (that last bit is speculation).<br />I have no idea if the same is true of KillDisk but that problem is avoided with&nbsp; hardware erasure.
