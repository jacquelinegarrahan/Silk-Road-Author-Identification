				I just made my first order the other day. But instead of going through eskrow, i just sent the funds directly to his username.<br />Yeah stupid mistake, but SR told me vendor should not have accepted the payment anyway.<br />Vendor replied and said he had recieved the coins. But now no reply regarding tracking number or anything...<br /><br />Are my coins gone? This vendor seemed legit and he&#039;s local. Has anyone done this and lost their coins?

				Who was the vendor? I&#039;d say ur coins are gone. Unless he says otherwise, or the package arrives, NEVER go around escrow it&#039;s there for YOUR protection, and piece of mind :)

				Well what can i say blowdrobro, it was a big build up, and he said he would waive the express shipping fee so it just made more sense to just send them that way...<br /><br />The vendor seems alright, but has only been a member for 3 months but with very good feedback..Bolder the vendor is -(alchemister)<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed he has logged on today but still no reply from any of my other messages, so i have a bad feeling....when a vendor doesnt communicate, then i worry. <br /><br />Maybe i&#039;ve jumped the gun i dont know. But SR said to me he runs the risk of being banned if he doesnt return my coins, so i should be ok..<br />Was only a very small order, so i&#039;m sure he wouldnt risk further sales for a measly $150.<br />I was surprised he waived the shipping fee. I had the amount for my order, but just ran short of having enough for express postage.<br />But what threw me was, first time he said it would go road mail, then he said he would express it so he could track it..but i know you can have anything tracked, regardless of road or air..<br /><br />Anyway fingers crossed. If no reply from him/her today, i&#039;ll know i&#039;ve been ripped from my first order. Could kick myself. &gt;:(

				Well express is safer (for non-bulk) then regular, and you can insure the package.

				Yeah i know. But again a simple email/message would be great.<br /><br />I had to message him to confirm he had recieved my coins, which he did.<br />Maybe some vendors dont like to communicate much, just take the order and send?<br /><br />If i was a vendor, i would keep them up to date. ;)

Usually the more busy ones, and you said he was only around for 3 months.<br /><br />Still if he has feedback then I&#039;d just cross your fingers for a few days.

				Yeah his feedback seems good. I really wanted to go through Matrix, but he had zero stock just when i was about to order, so my timing was very bad.<br /><br />I have to say overseas prices are so hard to ignore... so Ivory will be my next order, he looks awesome to deal with.<br /><br />Anyway fingers crossed i&#039;m good.&nbsp; ::)
