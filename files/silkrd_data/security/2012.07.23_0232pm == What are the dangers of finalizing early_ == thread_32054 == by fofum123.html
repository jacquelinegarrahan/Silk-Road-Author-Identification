				ask them to cancel and find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require it.<br /><br />if you FE they can take your money and not send you anything. then you&#039;re out of pocket and all you can do is change their feedback to a 1/5. this will kick some vendors into action, but not all of them

				Follow their guidelines if you want to order from them, but do it wisely. Make sure they have great feedback (look for feedback that doesn&#039;t just say FE), and look them up on the forums as well.<br /><br />I never had a problem FE when I was a new buyer, but I do have a problem when vendors want me to FE nowadays. I have had over 30 transactions, been a member for 6 months, and have a 0% refund rate and a 0.2% auto-finalize rate. It&#039;s rather insulting. I&#039;ve also spent over 300 BTCs at this point. I avoid those sellers at all cost because I&#039;m weary they&#039;ll take my money, even if they have great feedback. Selective scamming is easy for a vendor to do if they only do it 1/50 transactions.
