				Yeah I had seen that somewhere but nothing to back it up. Could be just have originated in someones ass, and then they proceeded to pull it out of there and project into cyberspace. Seems to happen alot!

				It has not been without peril, but this is the first time in my life I can think of being a part of something on the ground floor with potential to benefit greatly: SR and Bitcoin!<br /><br />I say bitcoin reaches $200, true.<br /><br />How soon will Silk Road&#039;s listings reach 10,000 items? <br /><br />That is what I have been monitoring. <br /><br />I joined when it wasn&#039;t even 5,000 and that wasn&#039;t that long ago.

				Make no mistake gentlemen (and ladies), we are a part of history. However this will all end (Bitcoin, SR, TOR .. if it ever &quot;ends&quot;), realize that are part of something bigger then cryptocurrency or buying drugs in the mail. I think we are part of the future. 50 years from now when people have BTC wallet addresses eletronically tatooed on their skin and pay each other by tapping each others for an instant transfer, they will look back at THIS time as the &quot;olden days&quot;. Anyways, sorry, I was wrong about $200.. I should have said $240 :)<br />

				Apply the laws of physics to economics. A fuel source will always be consumed, unless it is a stable material, like gold, platinum, silver... It is always worth recycling, saving, hoarding. Too valuable to be thrown away. Modern day applications of gold allow us to create supercomputers and other high-precision applications. BTC is much like this. It is protected by silicon and transition metals--integrated circuits--billions of them. The more people invest in ASICs, the more valuable BTC will become. It stabilizes it. Gold has not gone down in value--nor will it ever, like plutonium and uranium-235. Cryptocurrency--BTC--will last as long as there are computers and computer users.<br /><br />If North Korea or Iran or some nutjob detonates nukes in the upper atmosphere, disabling and/or destroying unshielded electronics (nearly ALL civilian resources and MOST of the military&#039;s) from an EMP, then BTC may be useless--as its protection will have been rendered useless. That is, when a vast majority of our computer resources are disabled from EMP or some clever virus/hack, then BTC will be devalued.

				250 by Wednesday morning. Absolutely steadily $300 by next Monday. It&#039;s only Tuesday and media frenzy and values have given BTC rockstar status. People get paid on the 15th of the month, which is next Monday. Some even get their salaries direct deposited the business day before at 11:59. I&#039;m positive people are waiting to get their paychecks to invest. Next Monday onwards, shit is going to get serious. Buy now. BUY RIGHT NOW. I&#039;m typing this from a new tricked out Macbook Pro I bought with just a few days of gains.. and yeah.. by looking @ my wallet it would be impossible to tell I even bought it! Don&#039;t stopppp believinnnnnnnn

				You hit that one out of the park, colorblack. I think it made $240 at 11 am. I&#039;m a uneducated person, but I&#039;m watching the price and it seems to have support. It goes down, people buy (according to bitcoinity.org/markets (**CLEARNET WARNING**) and the 24 hour volume seems to keep going up too. I think that that is good. You can&#039;t get around the fact that roughly 75% of BTC is &#039;hoarded&#039;-speculation. I think it will be on stronger grounds with even more volume. <br />I&#039;ve made more than 3 times, $6000 from $2000 in less than 2 weeks. I may eat those words in a year (or 6 months, 3 months, 3 DAYS)<br />I&#039;ve got all my money in BTC. <br />

				Pay attention to the constantly growing trading volumes...<br /><br />Max Keiser on Alex Jones (clear net) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVkXvwiVN8k<br /><br />A very interesting conversation with some very valid points. If bitcoin corners 2% of the forex market the coins will be worth millions.

It WILL eventually become part of everyday life and the term &quot;dollar&quot; will be as weird to hear as it is to hear about &quot;checks&quot; now.

It depicts how many resources you have at your disposal at any given moment. Right now, BTC is on the rise, and if you are holding BTC, then your personal wealth is increasing through time. Now is a moment in time that you are profiting, if you possess BTC. Profits don&#039;t last forever. If the BTC runs, then your momentary wealth will be decreasing at an alarming rate. BTC is a behavior indicator; all currency is. It is also what I just said, a representation of your wealth, whether the Swiss Frank or the British Pound.<br /><br />If you are a careful investor, you are slowing materializing your profits. Too suddenly could cause a run in the market. Too slowly and if there is a run, then you lose. How to win in a limited-resources world is to materialize your wealth. No one can take away your material goods. If you invest in property, for example, then you are investing in material that can preserve your wealth. If you invest in a car or house, then you are investing in something that requires resources to maintain and use, whether replacing tires or paying for auto insurance. These are also things, that when managed properly, benefits the whole of society.<br /><br />&quot;Hey, did you hear what they&#039;re doing to that old useless building in the projects?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, what?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sustainable agricultural center, to teach young people to develop sustainable skills and provide a supermetropolis, like New York City, a local source for food in case there is ever a natural disaster or fuel crisis.&quot;<br /><br />No shit. Now what are you doing here on the forum? Go accrue wealth and help the world by making the world a better place.
