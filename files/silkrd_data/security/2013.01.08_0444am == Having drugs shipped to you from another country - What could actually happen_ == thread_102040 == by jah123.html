				I&#039;ve been trying to figure this one out but can&#039;t find much legislation on it.<br /><br />If you was to purchase class B drugs and have them imported into the United Kingdom from a country outside of the EU, what could potentially happen in the case of a package seizure by customs?<br /><br />Importation of drugs? It&#039;s possible, but I&#039;m not sure, because you are not supplying, only purchasing for personal use. If it was not importation, I would assume that it would just be a nice little seizure notice from customs and/or a charge for possession of class B drugs.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of (but this is not the case for most buyers on SRM), is search warrants leading to charges for intent to supply, if the package was to contain a significant quantity of controlled substances.<br /><br />Any thoughts or input on this?<br /><br />Regards.

				Depends on about 10-20 different variables.

				Found some info, might be of some interest to others out there too wondering about customs. I&#039;m posting it below for anyone else that might be interested.<br /><br />These apply for your average purchase for your own use, in the UK only, since I can&#039;t find much on the UK at all.<br /><br />Clearnet, see p27, 28 &amp; 29; http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%20Practice/sentencing_for_drug_offences.pdf<br /><br />From other research<br /><br />&nbsp;what actions customs take; for small quantities... No love letter, no parcel, hear nothing, address flagged for intl. post.<br />Larger quantities or repeats of importation attempts, might try and coerce you into collecting with love letters, controlled delivery.<br />
