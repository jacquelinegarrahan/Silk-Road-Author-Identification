				Does PGP protect you from the cops being able to read what you are typing on the internet as in.. if you don&#039;t PGP what you type.. then the cops are reading it at &#039;&#039;home base&#039;&#039;<br /><br />or<br /><br />is the sole purpose of PGP to protect you from getting your computer confiscated and your address not being typed in...<br />and if it is this one.. what is to say that you didn&#039;t type your address in on ebay? does it show a date and time and web address for when you sent a message over an onion site without pgp?<br />it just doesn&#039;t make sense. I would like to understand how the information that protects me actually works<br /><br />peace

				I&#039;m not an SR vet, but I do know a little about tech. If you encrypt a message on your computer and then send it over the net, no they would need a super computer and some time to ever be able to crack what you wrote even if they are &#039;listening&#039; to your internet traffic. Now if you send something unencrypted even over the tor network and they&#039;re listening to your connection (rare) they could read it. Also I highly suggest using your deep web stuff like firefox configured with a proxy or the tor browser inside a virtual machine. Then encrypt that virtual machine file with Truecrypt. Also something else I recommend for any time you attach your computer to any network is to use a stable active firewall like Comodo Dragon. IMO anyway. I&#039;m sure there are some elite hackers that come through here that will tell me I have it all wrong about comodo, but who knows.

				Hello again Chris,<br /><br />Firstly, I have done a post in the Security section about how Public Key Cryptography works and suggest you read it, as it gives some basic information about the principles along which Tor, PGP and Bitcoins work.<br /><br />PGP is a way of protecting e-mail messages. The way in which it does this is discussed in the post above - suffice it to say that if I were to send you a message encrypted with your PGP public key and the Police were to seize it, it&#039;s extremely unlikely they would be able to read it.<br /><br />One use for PGP would be to encrypt your address when sending it to a seller on Silk Road, so they can send you a product. This reduces the chance that the message can be intercepted and your address compromised. If the seller&#039;s computer were then seized then every e-mail you&#039;d sent them would also be encrypted using their PGP key so without a password, the Police would be unable to read it.<br /><br />It&#039;s important you understand though that Tor browsing also encrypts your connection - in fact, in a very similar way to how PGP encrypts e-mails. Take a peek at this article for more information on how it works:<br /><br />http://www.addictivetips.com/internet-tips/what-is-tor-project-and-how-tor-works-complete-guide/<br /><br />As you can see, Tor allows you to browse the web without allowing any site to know what your physical location is. <br /><br />Why then use PGP to protect our e-mails? It&#039;s something of a &quot;belt and suspenders&quot; approach. Firstly, any fool can set up and operate a Tor exit relay so you can&#039;t always be 100% sure that the e-mails you write aren&#039;t being monitored, even if it&#039;s not possible to trace the actual IP address of the person sending them.<br /><br />Secondly, in the case of e-mail providers like Tormail - without using PGP we&#039;d have to trust the site creators not hand over the content of e-mails to Law Enforcement. Using PGP removes this problem as all they could hand over would be the contents of messages they can&#039;t decrypt.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21206.msg216512#msg216512">Quote from: chrisbarnett on May 01, 2012, 03:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does PGP protect you from the cops being able to read what you are typing on the internet as in.. if you don&#039;t PGP what you type.. then the cops are reading it at &#039;&#039;home base&#039;&#039;<br /><br />or<br /><br />is the sole purpose of PGP to protect you from getting your computer confiscated and your address not being typed in...<br />and if it is this one.. what is to say that you didn&#039;t type your address in on ebay? does it show a date and time and web address for when you sent a message over an onion site without pgp?<br />it just doesn&#039;t make sense.
