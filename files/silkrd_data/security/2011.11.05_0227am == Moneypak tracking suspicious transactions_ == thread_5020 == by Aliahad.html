				I was just looking at my recently used moneypak card and noticed this,<br />&quot;Use of this product is tracked. Verification of your identity may be required. Transaction information and store surveillance images are used to help law enforcement solve crimes and make arrests.&quot;<br />Does anyone know anything about this? Is it just used for extra evidence for someone already on trial, or do you think they watch any suspicious activity for people like us here on SR?

				Money pak is a GreenDot service that is backed by Columbus bank of Georgia. They will cooperate with LE and if they can, trace a money pack to a buyer, from a depositor, and follow the Bitcoins, if they can, to mount a case. Will they, can they? Theoretically, yes. Practically, if there was a big time SR vendor they wanted badly, they could sure try.

				They also do not want to be used as a money transfer system. Whatever! People are going to do whatever they want. Sucks all the changes going on.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like anyone with a funny name is buying 50k in MP every month and sending back home. MP watches everything and flinches a lot. Ridiculous.&nbsp;

				Columbus Bank needs to comply with what is called, &quot;know your customer&quot; laws. The GreenDot system of prepaid cards and reloads was a stretch for banking regulators. And, Paypal was a stretch for the card issuers back int he day, until became the establishment, and now we have numerous ways to transfer $$ in many ways. But, when the $$ exit the system, that&#039;s when the hammer comes down. It&#039;s a weakness of the market and currency systems. If you are reloading 40 cards and maxing them out - deposit wise, its a matter of time until they just pull the plugs, hold the money, or cooperate in an investigation. <br /><br />Someday, if the Bitcoin gets really popular and we can buy almost anything, get paid for legit work and products, etc., then there&#039;s a chance....for....total freedom/. Everyone here is a trailblazer. Ay, Mr. MDdroMc? That dude must have a story worth hearing.<br />
