				As a new would be buyer I sent an encrypted email via a newly created Hotmail adds in an Internet cafe to the given email address (ex tormail) of a high rated MDMA vendor asking to make a purchase where I would finalise early and looking for agreement on this and requesting a reply via my tormail id. The reason for this longwinded procedure was, to my mind, ensuring that my home ip adds was not involved!!&nbsp; I got no reply. Some time afterwards I sent a PM which I noticed was not read for a day or so but when it was no response came back.&nbsp; I then sent an encrypted email via tormail with essentially the same request. My tormail id is different to peadearbocht but I identified myself in the email. No response!! I have since discovered the the Internet cafe account I created is now indicating that it does not exist!!!!&nbsp; As i said above all contents were encrypted with the vendors public key. My public key was provided for the response,<br />Have I done something wrong here? <br />&nbsp;Regards.

				If the vendor states on his page that all non PGP encrypted mails will be ignored/disposed then that may be what happened in your case. Tormail`s down, which may be why he couldn`t receive it. You have to contact the SR admin to check the status of your account.
