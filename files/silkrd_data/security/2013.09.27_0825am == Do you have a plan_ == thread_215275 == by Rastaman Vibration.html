				Lets say the unthinkable happens. Lets say your package gets intercepted by LE. Do you have a plan? <br /><br />You should.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my plan:<br /><br />If the package doesnt show up or I receive a love letter, I will never use that address for SR shit again. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done a little risk analysis on my chances of a CD. I am only a buyer, and I don&#039;t really deal with quantity, so that&#039;s pretty low there. I also live in a large metropolitan area,&nbsp; and the LE resources at my location are already stretched pretty thin. So I think that lowers my risk even further. So I don&#039;t really have a plan for a CD, because I don&#039;t think I need one. <br /><br />But I do have a plan in case the cops show up for a little knock-and-talk. Don&#039;t talk to the police. Deny deny deny.<br /><br />What&#039;s your plan?

				Pretty worthy thread IMO. You&#039;ll probably get loads of people will say &#039;just say nothing&#039; etc etc. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been slightly paranoid over the last few days as I&#039;m waiting on something that was due yesterday. I tend to think about this stuff when waiting on deliveries. <br /><br />My feedback probably won&#039;t be that useful, as I&#039;m not overly experienced in this sort of thing. <br /><br />If LE turn up I will do the following <br /><br />1. Deny everything, act like whoever sent this package is trying to stitch me up for some reason. <br />2. If the cops get overly keen have a warrant etc. I will hope the find my &#039;Small&#039; stash as opposed to the slightly larger one - which is in a relatively obvious area (small one).&nbsp; <br />3. Call a lawyer ASAP if taken into custody. <br /><br />That&#039;s the plan, but it&#039;s nearly impossible to say what will happen in this situation, it&#039;s a case by case thing really.....

				I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m organized with similar protection and plausible deniability to that mentioned above. Above all, for me, it&#039;s about keeping a low profile and only associating with people I trust. I&#039;m not out selling to randoms or getting high in public or when I have to drive. I really don&#039;t worry about the postal system, I view that part as the most secure link in the chain actually.

Then I need to consider the likelihood of being caught doing both.<br /><br />If drugs are intercepted coming to my home address LE can immediately link me to the order, they may have a hard time proving that I actually ordered it but all the same my name is in the frame right from the get go. Personal risk associated with this should be considered quite high if I am ordering more than personal amounts on a fairly regular basis.<br /><br />If drugs are intercepted coming to a PO box then LE can investigate the owner of the box and come up with nothing that links me to the box. They could in theory put the box under surveillance but given mail can be left for weeks on end in a PO box without issue they could have a very long wait on their hands. Personal risk associated with this method would IMO be considered as quite low even though the penalties for being caught are harsher the actual chances of being caught are exponentially lower over all.<br /><br />Do I consider the possibility of harsher penalties for lower overall risk worth it? yes.<br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s very interesting @ssbd. Its a matter of personal judgement, I suppose. I also did some risk assesments, and decided not to use a fake to open a PO box. Ultimately, for me, it came down to plausible deniability, and the likelyhood of LE being able to obtain a search warrant for a CD. For me, I think the odds of that are very very low. <br /><br />Another thing that really sketched me out of the fake ID thing was that secret service bust a few months back. I just figured the fake was adding a lot more risk to the equation. <br /><br />Great to hear others&#039; opinions tho! Thanks for sharing :)<br />

				Well there is one problem in applying all this wonderful advice for me.<br />I live in a small area. Though I could easily blend in with all the Hispanics here I don&#039;t look like a person that typically lives in this area, and I wouldn&#039;t if I totally changed my image. And therein lies my problem with a Fake ID. There isn&#039;t enough people here for somebody at the post office to not know right away my real identity if not my entire name.<br /><br />So my only option is to go with a tested drop. Good information and a solid opinion SSBD though. ;)

There&#039;s no way one plan will fit everyone&#039;s needs. The point is, you should put some though into it. You should think about your risks, and how to minimize them.

				imo, due to the nature of SR, a lot of people are on this site under the influence of drugs.. so yeah, these precautions are good and all, but if you&#039;re deep into a meth binge.. you probably won&#039;t give a shit. like now, for instance, i&#039;m on an LSD trip lol.
