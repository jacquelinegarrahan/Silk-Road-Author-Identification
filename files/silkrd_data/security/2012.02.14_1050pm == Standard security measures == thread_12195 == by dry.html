				Hi guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m what you could call a complete newbie to the world of computer security. Until today, I only used my pc for &quot;standard&quot; stuff (gaming, downloading etc.). I installed TOR because I wanted to try it out for myself, discovered the hidden wiki and silk road (I love myself a good LSD tab now and then and some fine bud so it was love at first sight) and I ended up here :)<br /><br />However, as I said, I don&#039;t know much about PC security. I&#039;ve set up TOR, blocked cookies, Javascript and the like, but I got confused reading about &quot;PGP&quot; and the like. I set up a tor mail account, and was looking into those bitcoins, but can anybody tell me what precautions I should take before buying anything?<br /><br />I have the Tor browser bundle, Norton antivirus and a tor mail account. Is this secure enough or do you guys advice me some additional security measures?<br /><br />Thank you all for your help!<br /><br />dry

				For starters, go to the Tor wiki and read everything you can.&nbsp; (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/)&nbsp; Using the Tor network requires many changes in the way you use the Internet.&nbsp; For example, don&#039;t go to http: websites, you only want to access secure socket (https:) websites.&nbsp; And you want too keep your Tor software up to date -- security holes in Tor are always being found and so it&#039;s important to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp; <br /><br />A beginners guide to Tor would probably take up a few pages.&nbsp; Besides the Tor wiki just start at the torproject.org website and take your time studying what&#039;s been written.

				Adding to what others have already said...<br /><br />If possible, use one computer for your sports, family stuff, etc. etc. and another for all of your &quot;iffy&quot; stuff. If that&#039;s not possible at least use a VM on your current computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read up and use TrueCrypt.

				IF you have to use TOR on your regular (read non SR) computer, use at least the TOR browser bundle and not i.e. the Vidalia bundle along with the browser you also use for non anon stuff.<br /><br />A more secure solution is to use a completely different computer or VM for TOR / SR stuff. And of course always use some form of strong encryption for sensitive data.<br /><br />There are in depth guides on the web or even here on the forums I think. Do a search.
