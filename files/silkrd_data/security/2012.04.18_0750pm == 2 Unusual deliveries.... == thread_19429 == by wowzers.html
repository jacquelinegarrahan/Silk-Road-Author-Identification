				Title: <strong>2 Unusual deliveries....</strong><br />

				1: Ordered some MD pills from DE, they arrived unusually late (4 weeks). The envelope was wrapped in a plastic cover with a letter from Deutsche Post enclosed. My German isn&#039;t great but it basically said that the envelope had been damaged in transit and so had been re-wrapped and forwarded to me. The thing is, the envelope wasn&#039;t at all damaged, was unopened and the pills were still inside, undamaged...<br /><br />2: Last month I ordered 10g of MD from a major vendor in NL. It arrived swiftly and was well packaged. The weird thing is the package was bulked out with some pages torn from 2 different Dutch language publications. Back in November, I ordered 5g of MD from a different vendor in NL, the packaging was also bulked out with pages from the same 2 publications. The 2 were so specific that the 2 vendors must be the same person. Is this common practice that big vendors have more than 1 account??&nbsp; :-\

				a few pages were from a Dutch brochure, the others were from a Dutch book, couldn&#039;t be coincidence. It&#039;s not particularly worrying, there are plenty of reasons why a vendor might want to run 2 accounts. I was just intrigued as to whether anyone else has had a similar experience. The resealed German mail was slightly more worrying, particularly as it hadn&#039;t obviously been tampered with and the contents were intact.

				If a sack of mail gets damaged, then it was common for every item in that sack to be marked as damaged and forwarded like you said, at least that was the case when I worked at the post office many moons ago in a different life :)
