				what is the most secure way to send money to get coins. is there a way to set up a account to do email $ transfers with, and use a fake name? :-/<br /><br />Hmmm i wonder if a person could set up pay pal account with one of those prepaid visa&#039;s from shell.<br /><br />I was thinking of buying some coins from a user here, but i would have to email transfer the funds and then he would know my name... not comfortable with that. Perhaps i am over paranoid but you never know who the person is correct<br /><br />i am located in canada btw. <br /><br />thank you for your help, <br />as i am sure this has been covered many times before :o

				There are lots of guides on here, I personally use bitinstant.com to do a cash transfer at the bank to email / coinapult, then transfer it through wallets. You don&#039;t want to use paypal since that&#039;s easily traced and no vendor is going to accept cash, since they won&#039;t tell you their address unless they&#039;re either a moron or going to scam you.<br /><br />Go to bitinstant.com - Pay From select Cash Deposit, Pay To select Bitcoin to Email<br />If you don&#039;t already have a @tormail.org email, get one and use that. Rest is pretty straight forward, remember to make the amount higher than what you need because you will incur fees for the transfer and more fees for the transfer to wallets.

				Yeah, you definitely shouldn&#039;t purchase coins in any way that involves your name or other personal information.&nbsp; Keep in mind that unless you do some extra work, your coins are only as anonymous as the way you obtained them.&nbsp; Meister&#039;s suggestion to use bitinstant.com is a good one.&nbsp; Get-bitcoin.com is a similar service.&nbsp; Cash deposit at a bank (Chase, Bank of America) is generally considered the safest method.&nbsp; Cash/prepaid card in the mail could potentially be more anonymous, but it takes a lot longer.<br /><br />If you&#039;d still like to purchase through a vendor on SR, the most anonymous method is probably using a Moneypak.&nbsp; These vendor&#039;s fees are generally much higher than those of the aforementioned companies, and there&#039;s less accountability if the vendor steals your money, but some people are more comfortable using SR as a source.

				Hi buddy,<br /><br />Buying BTC with cash/goods in the mail or selling services in exchange for Bitcoin are the only two ways to be sure of obtaining them anonymously but I think the method described up there of a cash bank deposit should be safe enough for your needs.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24243.msg256152#msg256152">Quote from: kryst on May 24, 2012, 08:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">thanks guys.<br />i was also wondering because there is a guy who is selling coins on here, but he only accepts email money transfer :-/ ...then he would know my name correct? seems sketchy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;ve used them about 5 or so times now. You can either validate with them and use a bill payment on your banking, or deposit cash directly at any RBC branch. Great people there!
