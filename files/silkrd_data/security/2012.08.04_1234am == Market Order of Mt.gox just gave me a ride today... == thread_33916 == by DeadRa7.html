				Okay, so today I drop 700 into my bitinstant account and once it hit&#039;s mt.gox I&#039;ve got a total of $667.57 to play with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been noticing that the price of BTC is rapidly rising these last 36 or so hours, so I just went ahead and did a &quot;market order&quot; like I usually do for BTC, which funds my wallet by the time the page refreshes.&nbsp; However, something kinda fucked up happened-It appears when I chose the &#039;market order&#039; option, the fuckers charged me $11.09 per BTC!&nbsp; When I purchased earlier, it was approx. $10.30 &quot;Weighted Avg&quot;.&nbsp; I was under the impression that whatever the &quot;weighted avg.&quot; price was was the actual cost of the &#039;market order&#039; BTC?<br /><br />So after doing the math, with the BTC still in my wallet due to the problems people have faced today with funding their accounts, I have $642.xx in my account<br /><br />(I calculated the above # by multiplying the amount of BTC by the &quot;weighted avg&quot; on mt.gox, which, as of this writing, is only fractions of a cent away from what BTC is worth on SR.)<br /><br /><br />Can someone who is more experienced with this currency please tell me how in the living hell did this happen?&nbsp; Further, it would be wonderful to know how I can avoid paying more than btc is worth by placing a &#039;market order&#039;.&nbsp; Any help is much appreciated, thank you!

				This is how Bitcoins, and any other currency work. Nothing weird at all.<br /><br />Mt. Gox is great, much better than Intersango. Enjoy getting the cash into your bank account in less than 12 hours, assuming it&#039;s not a weekend.<br /><br />Did you do all the verification etc?
