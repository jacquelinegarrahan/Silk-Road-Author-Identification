Ok here we go. <br />1. Download PGP. There are tons of links out there to download it. Just google PGP. Go ahead and install the program and get it up and running. <br /><br />2. You must obtain the &quot;public key&quot; of the person with whom you wish to exchange encrypted messages. This is almost always in their profile. Click on their name and &quot;copy&quot; the ENTIRE section of text, beginning with &quot;start PGP signed message&quot;, and ending with &quot; end PGP signed message&quot;. <br /><br />3. Once you have their &quot;key&quot; copied, open a new text document with word processor, etc. and paste the user&#039;s key into the new document. TEMPORARILY save the document to your desktop. <br /><br />4. Now, using your pgp program, click the button at the top of the screen that says &quot;import&quot;. A menu will pop up and allow you to select the source of the file you want to import. Find and select the text document you just created, which contains the user&#039;s key. A message may pop up asking if you want to use the key, answer yes. Now a list of keys (called your &quot;keychain&quot;) will be created within your PGP program, containing all public keys of users you select.<br /><br />5. Ok, now click the button that says &quot;clipboard&quot;. A blank window will pop up, and you can now type your message. Just type a few generic words(hey, how are you?) for a test message. Once you have done this, click &quot;encrypt&quot; at the top of your PGP program. <br /><br />6. Another window will pop up(your &quot;keychain&quot; again), prompting you to select for whom you would like the message encrypted. Select the person you are messaging, and be sure to select the appropriate key, as only the owner of the key you select can &quot;read&quot; the encrypted message. <br /><br />7. Once again, you will be asked if you want to use the key you just selected. Select yes. Now your generic &quot;test&quot; message will transform into a scrambled series of characters. The message is now encrypted, and can only be decrypted by the person you selected from your list of keys(keychain).<br /><br />8. Highlight and &quot;copy&quot; the ENTIRE &quot;scrambled&quot; message. <br /><br />9. Now simply &quot;paste&quot; the scrambled message into an SR message, email, or other form of transmitting, and you&#039;re done. Once the recipient opens it, they can copy and paste the &quot;scrambled&quot; message into their PGP program, and decrypt it using their keys, and subsequently read the message you sent them. Easy right? Trust me, it will be once you do it a couple times.<br /><br />PGP simply encrypts and decrypts the text, it does not send/transmit the messages. You use whatever method you want to send it, just encrypt it with PGP first. Hope this helped.

				Hope that helped answer your questions. If not, Pm me, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Every person that uses PGP helps better this place, in my opinion. Plus this post helps push down some of the spammer threads.
