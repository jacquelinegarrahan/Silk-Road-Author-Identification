				I don&#039;t trust Mt. Gox and the most credible exchange I&#039;ve found, Crypto Xchange, charges too much ($15 USD for each withdrawal and transfer).<br /><br />Is there an exchange that is cheap and secure?<br /><br />Can I cheaply transfer funds only by working online (e.g., without depositing cash)? <br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				Get-bitcoin.com will accept bank transfers for no fee, though it takes much longer.<br />(3% charge if you want next day I believe)<br />

				Here is a great overview of exchange services:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade<br /><br />For myself i found a great exchanger on #bitcoin-otc, but i&#039;m just buying bitcoin not selling.<br />Even there are some traders buying bitcoins too.

				Tradehill has had most of my business lately..... was using btc-e for awhile till they started having HUGE delays for deposits or withdrawals intermittently. <br /><br />Tradehill is cool, you can use bitinstant.com to deposit cash as a local bank (in the US) and it&#039;s in your account in about an hour.

				I&#039;ve been using get-bicoins.com and they take forever sometimes. <br />could anyone suggest a faster way without a lot of fees? I like em&#039; I just wish they would hurry up sometimes.

				Maybe I&#039;ve been lucky but I&#039;ve been using Mt. Gox regularly and haven&#039;t had any problems. It&#039;s pretty quick and the fees aren&#039;t bad.

				SR vendors are the most secure but it isn&#039;t that cheap...I said this before you cant really clean these coins 100 percent (its linked to your bank account which is a shit idea) and I heard about moving them all around wallets before you put them in you SR. I JUST DONT LIKE GET BTC FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE MAYBE CUZ IM A IGNORANT NOOB ON THIS.<br /><br />BTC VENDORS ON SR-I mean you end up paying a lot more for your product when you have to buy a MP reload card then pay a percentage to the vendor for BTC OR/AND pay a specific amount per coin ,which is above its current value of the listing price. There are real professional vendors so you always get (usually a bit more I read) what you pay for, so there is no scamming if you go to the top dogs.<br /><br />Is it worth it at the end&gt; HELL YES IT IS!!!!!!
