				Good luck with your defense. Hopefully you have some cash saved. You just incriminated yourself by explaining your exact story as well. You have to be careful and it looks like you were not.

				If you admitted it was your package then they can arrest you. They&#039;d inspected it before and saw what was inside and did a controlled delivery. <br />How come it took so long to get you down? t sounds like you were resisting then. You should probably still sue them for police brutality though, since they can&#039;t really prove you ordered the package if you weren&#039;t convicted. That story seems weird though, they would&#039;ve searched your house.

				They did search my house, looked in my room and found nothing.<br />Thanks for the response tree, took down the main post but feel free to ask any questions.

				So did they just drop your case since then or do you have to go to court? Oh and you didn&#039;t answer my question as to why you resisted if they had a hard time getting you down??

				I was asking them why they were arresting me, but I was not letting them get me in cuffs they dropped they case because I was injured really bad.<br />They tried to give the cops the case to pin charges on me but when the cops seen I had a dislocated arm, they searched my house found nothing and the cops left then I went to the hospital in a ambulance.

				Oh well in that case you can totally sue them! And don&#039;t just sue them to pay your medical bills, sue them for all you can. If you say they dropped it because of your condition then they just didn&#039;t want you to sue them for police brutality so they left you alone... That means you can make them pay. Find a lawyer and ask him about that, he&#039;ll tell you if it&#039;s worth it.
