				Title: <strong>Buyer Feedback</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>MarijuanaIsMyMuse</strong> on <strong>November 27, 2012, 03:27 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				This is a request by myself, MarijuanaIsMyMuse, and on behalf of other vendors who operate here, that buyer&#039;s please limit the amount of detail they provide when leaving feedback on their transactions.<br /><br />As a vendor it&#039;s great to scroll through page after page of satisfied buyer comments and read how great they think the product is, the prompt communication they received from the vendor, the speed at which their order was placed in transit, how quickly they received it and the quality of the packaging. For buyer&#039;s it&#039;s an invaluable tool when deciding who they should or should not do business with, what kind of service they can expect to receive, how quickly they will receive it and how well their item will be packaged. However this information is freely available to anyone who has registered on the site and can be read by both legitimate buyers and site infiltrators.<br /><br />In the case of infiltrators, it gives them more than enough information on who they should be targeting and where they can focus the resources at their disposal so as to have a maximum impact. A little information goes a long way and makes their jobs much easier, and the less information they can freely learn browsing vendor feedback will slow them down and force them to waste the limited resources at their disposal.<br /><br />Stating that a vendor has great stealth packaging or that an order only took X day to reach a certain country gives them a better idea of who to look out for or what time frame they should be monitoring at delivery centers. In the past I have even scanned through other vendors feedback, looking for comments about stealth packaging so I know who to order from in order to enhance my own packing techniques and you can be quite sure that LE does the same thing so as to better profile and identify suspect packages.<br /><br />As vendors we have to constantly change, enhance and upgrade our shipping methods. This takes significant time and money, both to find who has the good packaging, pay for the product and source and purchase new shipping materials. Ultimately these costs are passed to the buyers in the form of costlier items.<br /><br />By limiting the amount of detail provided through vendor feedback, it will make LE&#039;s job harder and force them to spend some of their limited budget funds on vendors they wish to further investigate and many established buyers have ways of detecting suspicious buyers and will choose not to work with questionable buyers. The same goes for posting in forum review threads. Please limit the amount of detail you provide. The forums can be browsed without even having to sign up and log in.<br /><br />Many vendors post shipping times on their profiles, so check there if you&#039;re curious as to how long it will take. If they don&#039;t send them a message. If they have many reviews for previous successful deliveries, obviously their orders are successfully arriving, so their packaging must be a decent quality<br /><br />Limiting feedback to poor/good/excellent product/communication/delivery or not received, refunded should be more than sufficient. No other details are really necessary. With enough feedback, a decent reputation and a good history on the site, buyers should be able to make their own informed decision. Again, if in doubt, message the vendor. If they don&#039;t respond, there&#039;s many others to choose from.<br /><br />Many of us work very hard to get your orders out as quick as possible and work more than full-time jobs doing what we do to stay on top of everything. We appreciate the buyers who trust and choose to do business with us and most go out of our way to keep them happy and satisfied so they will come back again and again. So please help us continue doing what we do so we can continue to serve you and get your orders out as quickly as possible. Don&#039;t divulge too much information that can be used by others to target and identify our methods, forcing us to keep changing our techniques and taking up our time on other matters when we should be focusing our efforts on message responses, buyer orders and package shipments. A good vendor should be doing many of these things already. The more information given away means we just have to do it more often.<br /><br />Thanks<br />MJMuse

				Amazing post MiMM. I think this goes forgotten all too often. I believe that the only shipping information that should be talked about is success rate. No speaking about packaging, timeframe, or any other possible indicators. Keeping our vendors safe should be the #1 priority of all SR buyers.

				I&#039;m just here to bump the OP.&nbsp; Buyers need to take a minute to read and understand what is being said as well as think of the vendors when they leave feedback.

I ORDERED FROM YOU THE FIRST TIME AND THOUGHT IT WAS MAYBE JUST A MESS UP WITH THE CANADIAN POST EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NEVER HAD A DOMESTIC ORDER SIEZED, YOU SAID MY STORY WAS BULLSHIT JUST LIKE KOPICO AND DIDN&#039;T GIVE ME ANY REFUND. WHATEVER. SMALL AMOUNT. I DONT CARE. WELL NOW I DO BECAUSE YOU DID THE EXACT SAME FUCKING THING WITH THE 2ND ORDER I GOT FROM YOU EXCEPT IT WAS DOUBLE!!! THERES NO FUCKING WAY THIS CAN HAPPEN DOMESTIC TWICE. THAT WAS FUCKING 3 MONTHS AGO WHEN I ORDERED THE FIRST ONE AND NOW YOUR SAYING THE EXACT SAME BULLSHIT. ALL YOUR RATING ARE YOUR OWN AND YOUR BUSINESS IS BULLSHIT. WHEN THE FUCK IS SR GONNA SHUT THIS FAGGOT DOWN. FUCK U FUCK U FUCK U FUCK U FUCK U. YOU FUCKING PRICK FAGGOT SCAMMING MOTHERFUCKER. YOU GET EVERYONE TO FE THEN SCAM THEM!!!! DONT FE WITH THIS FAGGOT!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dickheads like you are the reason this place is where it is now. MIMM is NOT a selective scammer. I and many others have all received our orders. Firstly, your orders are NOT DOMESTIC. They are sent via International Post you wanker. YES, losing a package can happen twice, of course it can! Fuck, you could lose 10 or more. Who the fuck knows?? Your obviously technically inept and don&#039;t understand how things work on SR. Go back to buying your foilies from the local pub before you jeopardize your anonymity!! There are risks involved when ordering illegal products through our borders, don&#039;t you understand that? Coming on here, posting in all caps, shows what a nob jockey you really are. I&#039;m not going to bother outlining the procedure you take if an order doesn&#039;t arrive, wouldn&#039;t waste my time. <br />MIMM, excellent post and a good wake up call for some people. There is just no need for any detail relating to transactions to be posted. Keep things simple
