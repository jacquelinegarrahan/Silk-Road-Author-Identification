				These are a few months old but I thought some of you could gleam a bit of information from these articles.<br /><br />http://heraldbulletin.com/breakingnews/x2145132429/Postal-inspectors-uncover-six-pounds-of-marijuana<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;According to the affidavit of probable cause, police were alerted of the package by U.S. Postal Inspectors&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Postal investigators [...] working alongside the Madison County Drug Task Force, delivered the package to Wrightâ€™s residence [...]. Minutes later, after police were signaled that Wright had opened the package, officers entered the home and arrested him.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Postal inspectors advised police that they had intercepted a similar package in November 2011, also addressed to Wright.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/312151/dog-helps-police-seize-drugs-ak-47<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;A drug-sniffing dog with the U.S. Postal Inspectors helped tip the police to a 24-year-old Concord man&quot;<br /><br />&quot;the police had previously received tips about Cayes, but it was a call from the postal inspectors that spurred the investigation. &quot;As it so happened, because of this relationship with the postal inspectors, they were aware and got a package their drug dog hit on,&quot; Baker said.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;According to a police affidavit dated Feb. 3, the police got a call in January from a postal inspector who suspected a package he was asked to deliver to Cayes&#039;s address had illegal drugs. The inspector told the officer the package was addressed to someone at Pats Peak, but the postman who tried delivering it was told no one by that name was at that address&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The officer asked Cayes what was in the package, &quot;and he would not say anything and started looking at the ground,&quot; according to the affidavit. He wouldn&#039;t let the inspector search the package, but later agreed to let the police open it after the officer said he would get a search warrant&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The officer told Cayes he wouldn&#039;t take him into custody that day but would seek a warrant for his arrest&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Baker said it&#039;s often difficult to catch drug packages, given the volume of mail the U.S. Postal Service processes and the way drugs are mailed. &quot;This was not, &#039;I&#039;m a buddy sending a buddy drugs through the mail,&#039; &quot; he said. &quot;These are double heat-sealed packages.&quot;<br /><br />But while Cayes&#039;s package was professionally sealed, the inspector&#039;s dog still caught it, Baker said. &quot;The dogs are hitting on the smell of marijuana, mostly because the people who are packaging it are lazy,&quot; he said.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Moral of the story: Never sign for a package. Never talk to the pigs.

				Interesting: &quot;Minutes later, after police were signaled that Wright had opened the package&quot;<br />So I guess the trick of marking it return to sender and leaving it unopened for a few days does actually defeat the police

				Buyers ... if possible become familiar with the packaging of your vendors products. Police often need to repackage the product in order to conceal tracking devices or what have you and that should be a big red flag.<br /><br />This happened to the ill fated buyer of mine that opened a trace into a seized package. I always deliver in envelopes and he accepted delivery of a mid sized box .... rest is history.<br /><br />Be safe.

				We are beating around the subject here but what is trying to be established in almost all circumstances above is ... possession.<br />Signing implies possession<br />&#039;Opening&#039; (thus the device to signal when opened) implies possession<br />Getting him to admit it is his... case closed.<br /><br />The important aspect in all this is to deny possession both physically and verbally.<br /><br />Do not sign...<br />Do not open immediately... (remove to another location, then open)<br />Do not TALK!!<br /><br />You have ZERO to gain by speaking to anyone other than a lawyer... the judge only cares about you being cooperative at sentencing... the point is NOT to get to this stage.<br /><br />TJ
