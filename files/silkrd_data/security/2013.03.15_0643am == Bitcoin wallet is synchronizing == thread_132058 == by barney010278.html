				I opened by Bitcoin wallet a few hours ago and at the bottom it says synchronizing with network, then there is a bar that is showing percentage and is on about 29,000 blocks remaining and slowly working its way down. My question is, does it need to go down to zero before my deposit I made show up or will they show up before. It just seems like its going to take 8 hours before it will get to zero which surely is not how long it takes??<br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Sorry if its a retarded question im just struggling with computers

				It has to sync at least to the point in time when you received the transfer before it will actually show up.&nbsp; Or you can look at your address at blockchain.info to put your mind at ease while you wait for the client to sync.

If there&#039;s at least one confirmation on coins sent to your address, you can spend the coins, even if your client hasn&#039;t downloaded that part of the block chain. (The transaction will show up when you dowload the block)<br /><br />Think of it as an absurdly slow way of downloading your bank history.<br /><br />Except actual ACH transactions take much longer. :)<br />

				Thanks astor:)<br />So can I just confirm, your saying that as on blockchain it shows 15BTC with 7 confirmations that I can just press the green button saying deposit with cash and send this directly to SR?<br />So I dont really need my seperate wallet thats synchronizing?

				Good lord, I hope you can&#039;t do that :)&nbsp; You need the secret key that&#039;s contained in your local Bitcoin wallet to send those coins anywhere.&nbsp; If you export that and import it into Blockchain or something, then you can go ahead and transfer them.&nbsp; But without the information in whatever wallet generated that address, you can&#039;t touch the coins any more than I can.

				Yeah I see what you mean. So your saying I can put the transaction through in my actual wallet and when the money appears it automatically sends?

				I don&#039;t think so, no... I mean it&#039;s possible that feature is written into the bitcoin-qt client, but I doubt it.&nbsp; There is support for broadcasting raw transactions, but that really isn&#039;t something you want to do -- I mean it would take longer to figure out how to do it that way than to just wait for the client to catch up with the blockchain.<br /><br />If you just simply can&#039;t wait -- although I&#039;d recommend that you do anyway -- what you can do is go into the bitcoin-qt client (I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s the one you&#039;re using), go to the &quot;help&quot; menu, and click on &quot;Debug Window&quot;.&nbsp; Then in there, click on the &quot;Console&quot; tab.&nbsp; Then in the little entry box, what you want to do is type &quot;dumpprivkey BITCOINADDRESSHERE&quot; (obviously replace the caps with the address you sent the coins to).<br /><br />Then find the option to import a key or wallet or whatever into blockchain, and you can then send them from blockchain.&nbsp; You may have to unlock your wallet before dumpprivkey will work (you definitely will have to if you keep your wallet encrypted, which you should).&nbsp; To get a list of all supported commands, you can type &quot;help.&quot;&nbsp; Note that this is not intended for your average user.&nbsp; If you screw up the paste or something, there&#039;s not much anybody can do to help you.&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s not *that* dangerous or anything, but be careful what you type is all I&#039;m getting at :)
