				We can do a western union transaction but it&#039;s very expensive, they have high fees. If that doesn&#039;t matter to you and you are interested contact me on SR.

				1) bitcoin2cash.<br /><br />they take letters full of cash.&nbsp; The competing service, bitcoin4cash, appears to be dead or inactive at the moment.&nbsp; Bitcoin2cash still maintains active communication,, though they have little or no reviews.<br /><br />the guy who runs it is very focal on forums.&nbsp; tough to tell. <br /><br />services like this are sketchy at best, and even if he IS legit, its still very unsettling.<br /><br />2) Bitcoin fog.&nbsp; They are a &quot;laundering/mixing&quot; service.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t understand the exact specifics, but my understanding is that they do the following:<br /><br />you deposit BTCs, which are then randomly transferred from one address to another, in random increments, multiple times, before being available to withdraw<br />this takes a pretty god damn long time, but part of that is intentional.&nbsp; &nbsp;all of the transaction AMOUNTS are random.... so if you deposit 27 bitcoins, then exactly 27 bitcoins are not just jumped from one to another, which would be easy to follow.<br /><br />that would be broken up into random increments, and possibly broken up further after each iterative step.<br />ultimately they are available for withdraw.<br />you then withdraw them into (ideally) multiple different bitcoin addresses, again in random increments, separated over a minimum of 6 hours.<br />thus the downside becomes:<br /><br />the fog process itself takes a min of about 12 hours, and unless you have a wallet service that can take deposits from multiple different addresses, you will have to involve YET EVEN MORE bitcoin wallet/exchange services, all of whom have different operating principles (Virwox, for example must &quot;manually verify&quot; a transaction, which they say takes up to 48 hours).<br /><br /><br /><br />3) the final one is the moneypak guy on SR.<br /><br /><br />I SHOULD POINT OUT:&nbsp; I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED THE MONEYPAK GUY BY SEVERAL HIGHLY TRUSTED SILK ROAD MERCHANTS.<br /><br /><br />that gives him the gold standard in my book.

				Should work if you can&#039;t do the cash deposit or mail them a money order or something.<br />You could also send coin through the bitcoin wallet you are running through TOR, that can save you a lot of time.&nbsp; I mentioned how to do it in another post.

				I&#039;m interested in getting bitcoins annonymously too. I&#039;d also like to avoid instawallets if the bitcoins are 100% annonymous. I&#039;m thinking of sending a cash envelope to get-bitcoins.com. The 5% fee is worth the annonymity, I think. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen recommendations about purchasing insurance for the envelope of cash, but wouldn&#039;t that destroy the annonymity of sending cash? In order to be reimbursed for a lost package, FedEx will need my address. Am I missing something?<br /><br />Also, get-bitcoins.com says they&#039;ll send your cash back to you if they are unable to buy bitcoins at the exchange rate you set. But I&#039;d rather not have my address involved in any way.<br /><br />Does anyone else use the cash envelope method with no addresses or real names?

				Are you to far away to go to a Chase or Bank of America???&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if it was a little bit of a distance away I think I would rather do that than send an envelope of cash in the mail.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cash deposits at either bank is easy as can be and TOTALLY anonymous too.&nbsp; Well&nbsp; ok they have you on video but they don&#039;t have your name or anything else about you so that&#039;s still pretty anonymous to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Luck.

Without instawallet there&#039;s no middle-man (worthwhile or not) but it sounds reasonable to me that if they didn&#039;t know you besides your face, and get-bitcoin didn&#039;t know it was sending btc to SR, it&#039;s annoymous enough.. Right?
