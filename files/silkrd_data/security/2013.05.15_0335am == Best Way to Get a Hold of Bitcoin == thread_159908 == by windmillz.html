				I have read about many ways to get bit coins, all of the ways still sound incredibly hard, and not very anonymous. I like the bitinstant path, it seems quick and easy. I would have to tumble the coins a couple times I suppose? If someone could give me a detailed step-by-step of the safest fasted way to obtain bitcoin I would greatly appreciate it. Because of this step I have still not dived into ordering anything&nbsp; yet. I really do want to jump in soon though, I see many opportunities.

				If you use the search utility and keep to recent threads, you should find what you need with little effort.

				Try SR vendor CoinXchange. <br /><br />You use cash to anonymously buy a reload pack (see the vendor&#039;s page for the accepted types). You can buy the packs at 7-11 and many other locations.<br /><br />Next you use the free SR item listing to give CoinXchange the pack number and they send the Bitcoins to your SR wallet.<br /><br />They also accept MoneyGram and Western Union.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s even easier than Bitcopia was. You don&#039;t need to worry about moving or washing your coins if you want to use them on SR.

				This has worked for me: <br /><br />- Put order through Bitinstant on clearnet to deposit to my personal wallet<br />- Deposit cash at CVS/Walmart<br />- Receive funds within 60-120 minutes<br />- Open Tor browser<br />- Transfer coins to anonymous wallet, new registration every time (this site offers free tumbling service, others prefer Bitfog but it&#039;s slow and has a higher charge)<br />- Create new Tor identity after transfer is complete<br />- Create new bitcoin address on SR<br />- New identity<br />- Transfer to SR<br /><br />Personally, I have used my real info for MG and Bitinstant. Buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, and you can launder/tumble them after they are in your possession. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure others have methods, perhaps even more secure, but this has always worked for me. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />edit: I forgot to add that I am behind a VPN always.

				Yes, it&#039;s true........buying bitcoins is not illegal but buying illegal drugs with bitcoins is.<br />Can SR members please tell me what they have purchased with bitcoin, besides illegal drugs?<br />Bottom-line is....drugs should be legal and we wouldn&#039;t&nbsp; be playin&#039; this cat and mouse game. <br /><br />Ya feel me?

				only reason anyone has to get bitcoin is to speculate or buy drugs, unless your a rich stock trader then its not hard to figure out what your doing.
