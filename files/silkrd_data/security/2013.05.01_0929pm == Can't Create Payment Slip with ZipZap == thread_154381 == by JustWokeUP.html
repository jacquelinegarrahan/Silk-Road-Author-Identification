				Whew just made it out of newbie... ;D<br /><br />So I&#039;ve been having this problem with zipzap/cashpayment where it&#039;ll redirect me from bitinstant to the payment slip page but it won&#039;t load the country (clicking &quot;change country&quot; literally does nothing) so the &quot;create payment slip&quot; option will be grayed-out. In the past reloading the page over and over has eventually caused the country to load (with the map underneath it etc) but I&#039;ve been trying for a while now with no luck.<br /><br />Does anyone know why this happens? Is it a script support issue?<br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;ve had the same kind of thing happen to me.&nbsp; Annoying as can be.&nbsp; A few things that I have tried is, reloading the page a couple times or even switching browsers may help.&nbsp; What browser are you loading the page with?

				I&#039;m using epiphany on liberte linux<br /><br />And a couple times?! I&#039;ve been reloading this shit for hours lol...<br /><br />Oh and another question: I have the order number at the top of the page, do I have to actually create the payment slip for the order to process? I&#039;m pretty sure the ZipZap address and account don&#039;t change (one of the numbers is 9611 if I remember correctly) so would just filling out the slip with those be enough?

				Hmm, that&#039;s a bummer mate.&nbsp; I can&#039;t help there unfortunately :/ and yes, I do believe that you need the whole slip.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, the account charge number is pretty long, maybe 10 or more digits and that is on the full slip.

				Would using liberte&#039;s unsafe browser be an idea or would that immediately eliminate the anonymity?

				I would be as safe as possible with the browser you choose, at all costs.&nbsp; But, if you are using fake info, name, address, and such on it then I wouldn&#039;t think it&#039;s such a bad idea.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to lead you into using anything that could eliminate your anonymity though, so I would try every other possible safe option first.&nbsp;
