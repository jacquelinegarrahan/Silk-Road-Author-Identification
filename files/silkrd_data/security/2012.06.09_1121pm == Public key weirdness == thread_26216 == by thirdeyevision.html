So when I try and encrypt a message to him his name doesn&#039;t appear under the list of recipients. I&#039;ve tried updating his info from the key server, and it says no keys are found. Is this a security measure I should be aware of regarding sending my key to the key server in the first place? Is the lack of a sub key the reason he is not showing up as a recipient? Any help with this would be GREATLY appreciated. Thx and stay safe..<br />

				Awesome. Thanks Guru. Sent you a PM with the key in question. Will update here if we can get to the bottom of it. Any other OSX users having this issue?<br /><br />

				Hey&#039;all<br /><br />I have been having the exact problem with the recipients not being selectable when encrypting (OSX), it only seems to be 1 vendor in particular and ironically the guy I have identified so far as being the person I most would like to deal with regularly!!<br /><br />GRRRRR<br /><br />Looks like to me it seems to be the much shorter keys?<br /><br />Pm sent Guru, hope you can help me 2??<br /><br />Many thanks (:<br />

				I am experiencing the same problem, running Lion with the latest version of GPG Tools. I have no trouble encrypting messages to the majority of vendors but have recently come across two vendors who do not display as recipients when I try to encrypt a message. Their information still appears in GPG Keychain Access. I&#039;ve tried re-importing the keys, re-installing GPG Tools, restarting, etc, to no avail.<br /><br />Both of the vendors who do not display as recipients are using Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32), though I have been able to successfully encrypt messages from other vendors using this version. Also, both of the problematic public keys appear much shorter than usual (just ~12 lines). I have no idea if that is relevant.<br /><br />It seems like a number of Mac users have encountered this problem. Does anyone have any leads on a solution? Is there an alternative Mac encryption process that might let us encrypt messages to these vendors?
