				fuck bitcoin.<br /><br />Its not private for australians anymore..<br />you have to supply your ID and all this other info<br />just to put money through. and mtgox keep a history of all<br />of your transfers.<br /><br />It&#039;s not fast.. you have to wait up to 3 days for the money<br />to come through. then to put your money from your account onto<br />silkroad can take up to 24hours!<br /><br />the coin is not reliable.. (just look at the bitcoin graph...<br />wow..) The price can easily rise.. i put 1000 dollars into bitcoin<br />and it rose by 0.5+. imagine if that happened with US currency<br />or AUD or the EURO!! <br /><br />Mtgox have just refunded my money twice.<br />once their account got shutdown<br />2nd time they told me they would accept it <br />and then refunded it and told me they needed my ID.<br /><br />And tradehill is no fucking better.. Their accounts got frozen<br />as far as i know the people who put money into that arent even getting it back!<br /><br />People are throwing money into this expecting it to go up in value<br />but we&#039;ve seen this happen before! (remember when everyone was investing in www)<br />&nbsp;the bubble has already burst for bitcoin!<br /><br />I&#039;ve lost hope... the silk road seems to of hit a dead end for me.<br />

				Just on the private bit, it&#039;s always going to be hard for us to get coins and not have it linked to us. But if you remember to tumble between MtGox/Tradehill and SR and it at least makes it a lot harder to track. All Bitcoin transactions are freely available to be followed through the chain, so anonymity is never going to be truly possible.<br /><br />What&#039;s more is owning bitcoins, even in SR is not illegal. Having drugs in your possession is. The former raises suspicion of the latter, but that&#039;s it. If you&#039;re careful and don&#039;t get caught with drugs in your possession you should be OK. Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />I fell your pain though, it&#039;s not easy down here.

				Technocash seems to be another stepping stone option, albeit at something like 5% expense. <br />&nbsp;<br />UKash or something also seems to be another option<br />&nbsp;<br />Another possible alternative... if you have a good friend or family member outside of Australia you could send them money, they then set up their own mtgox/tradehill/whatever account, buy bitcoins and pay directly to your SR account<br />&nbsp;<br />Any other ways???<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				can I suggest you find or grow a product. Set up a vendor account. Sell your wares and use that money to buy the products you want.<br /><br />Couple of ideas- Buy flick knives in kit form from the number 1 flick knife supplier on google. Thoroughly read his international shipping requirements and sell these on silkroad. You will sell heaps in Aus. I was going to do it myself but I dont have the time atm. <br />&nbsp;or<br />Import a product and relist it at an inflated price for those who are not in a position to risk importing themselves. Ask a fair price. One you would pay yourself. You can probably make 100% on your risk alone. If you dont want to set up a vendor account maybe ask a local vendor that you feel you could trust to list your items for you. Then once the product has been shipped and funds released the vendor transfers you the btc.<br />or<br />We need good fake IDs in Aus. Drop 3 grand on a Evolis Dualis card printer, Buy holograms from china and learn photoshop on youtube and you will make squillions<br /><br />If you are a regular buyer you should get trading

I used my real name to create the netteller account, but only because I see the only proof of using bitcoins for illegal purposes lies in linking my wallet to the address I sent the coins to on silk road. Since silk road changes the bitcoin address for every transaction, and the fact that I encrypt my wallet I don&#039;t see it as easy to prove anything as far as the cops are concerned.<br /><br />Feel free to PM me if you want to ask any more questions. I have more to say, but I don&#039;t want to say it in public.

				Yeah I&#039;ve used UKash before, you can buy them at IGAs and newsagents etc. very convenient, if the cashier doesn&#039;t know how to issue epay Ukash vouchers bring along the printed instruction slip off UKash&#039;s website.<br /><br />There&#039;s a UKash exchanger with 7% fee or so, Ukash ---&gt; LR etc --&gt; BTC, there might be a Ukash --&gt; BTC exchanger I haven&#039;t looked recently. Or you could buy coins via WU with a fake ID.<br /><br />And as has been said before, BTC&#039;s aren&#039;t illegal to possess, the drugs are.

				wow.. i go on https://support.mtgox.com/home<br />and this is what they have to say..<br /><br /><br />Technocash Account Closure<br /><br />Mt.Gox Support Sep-22 • Announcements / Announcements<br /><br />Dear Mt.Gox Users,<br /><br />It is with great regret that we must inform our Australian customers that Technocash has closed the Mt.Gox National Australia Bank account and the Mt.Gox Bank West account.<br /><br />The account was closed as Technocash was receiving an extremely high number of fraud complaints from Australian customers. It appears that a number of criminal elements were using Technocash as a means of laundering funds obtained through credit card and identity theft through various bitcoin exchanges and then converting any stolen funds into USD for withdrawal internationally.<br /><br />What does this mean for you?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Funds may no longer be deposited or withdrawn using the Technocash transfer method. Our Australia-based users may still access their funds using International Wire Transfer, and we are presently investigating alternative banking options.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Any funds deposited or withdrawn using Technocash over the past week are currently being held by Technocash. They have stipulated that they will hold these funds until all fraud claims submitted to them have been processed, at which point they will release the remaining funds not used to pay out fraud victims to Mt.Gox. We will then complete the transfer which you originally requested.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Please be aware that Technocash has yet to give us a timeframe for this fraud claim process to complete.<br /><br />We sincerely apologize for this extremely unfortunate change in circumstances, and would advise all customers who have recently made a Technocash deposit to urgently contact their bank and cancel the transfer.<br /><br />As Mt.Gox was not made aware of the account closures until they occurred, we have been unable to take any action to safeguard users&#039; funds at this time. We are presently negotiating with Technocash in the hope of reaching a satisfactory compromise for all parties involved.<br /><br />We would again like to apologize for the inconvenience caused to our Australian customers, and reassure you that whilst funds presently with Technocash will be unavailable for the short term, no funds have been lost and all transactions made will be properly completed once the fraud claim process has completed.<br /><br />Further information is available by contacting Mt.Gox Support at info@mtgox.com.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Mt.Gox Support Team<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Security Measures Explained<br /><br />Mt.Gox Support Sep-22 • Announcements / Announcements<br /><br />Dear Mt.Gox Users,<br /><br />As you may be aware, a number of user accounts have been suspended as a result of recently implemented tightened security measures which have identified these accounts as showing suspicious activity. These measures have been brought into place at the insistence of a number of banking and policing entities after an increase in the incidence of fraud, phishing attacks and money laundering being carried out using bitcoins to mask illegal transactions.<br /><br />Should your account be suspended and you believe this suspension to be in error, we ask that you please submit identification documentation to aml@mtgox.com, so we may begin the process of un-suspending your account.<br /><br />The identification documentation that Mt.Gox requires once an account has been suspended pending review are:<br /><br />- One (1) government-issued photo identification document, such as a driver&#039;s licence, passport or similar.<br />- One (1) official identification document which clearly displays current residential address, such as a utility bill or the like.<br /><br />Once gathered, the documentation in question is held on a secure data store. Any submitted information will not be shared by any third party under any circumstance, except where Mt.Gox is legally obliged to do so at the instigation of a police investigation.<br /><br />Please be aware that due to the sudden increase in AML requests, processing of submitted documentation has become slightly delayed. We thank our users for their continued patience and support as we adjust to the requirements which have been obligated upon Mt.Gox.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Mt.Gox Support Team

				Might be difficult to exchange Ukash anonymously now, I&#039;ve seen some exchangers now requiring ID. Whether they verify it, who knows.<br /><br />If complete anonymity when buying BTC helps you to sleep better at night, there&#039;s also still the option of sending exchangers Western Union with a fake ID.

				Alright, will let you guys know how it went so far.<br /><br />Ukash was a fail, every epay location i went to the staff denied having the voucher on their system, even with the print-out from the site. I went to ~10 locations in sydcbd.<br /><br />Another issue, Neteller requires identify verification, two channel verification. Real bummer :(.<br /><br />I have decided to go with a btc exchange based in bris, requires an openid. so far ok, did a direct bank transfer. <br /><br />am looking at doing a bit of a tumble through ewallets before i bring the btc to SR!<br /><br />so, all in all... yes we ARE FUCKED! ...

				I second jesusjoints on MtGox. They completely fucked me too. Asked me to transfer to technocash, then two hours later told me it had been shut down all along, and that my money would be placed on hold until all fraudulent claims had been processed (apparently people were saying they never received their btc or something). <br /><br />It took a -hell- of a lot of groundwork to get my money back - I&#039;ll never deal with the fuckers again. <br /><br />I buy a lot of my coins privately from miners (a risky option given I have to transfer money first). That and I end up getting fucked on price because everyone is holding on to their coins thinking there&#039;s going to be some kind of massive btc price rebound - I think they&#039;ve levelled out around the $3 mark and won&#039;t move dramatically unless something crazy happens (i.e another security breach which will scare people off = lower price, or dramatic increase in demand)

				Hmm I didn&#039;t see this thread before... I noticed a few days ago that Mt Gox no longer had bank transfer option for us, did a bit of research and saw the reason (money laundering/fraud, our gov requiring ID). Well to hell with giving my identity to a BTC exchange, not only is it easier to track me here but its easy for them or someone hacking them to steal your identity.<br /><br />I tried a few other places, all seemed shit. I&#039;ve now landed on worldbitcoinexchange. They don&#039;t require ID, still have an Aus bank to transfer to, and in the test I did with $20 it seemed to go well. They didn&#039;t email me when the funds were in my account so I don&#039;t know how long it took, 1-2 days only though. AUD traded to BTC almost instantly. I then jumped it to a few other accounts I have before coming here. About 8-9 hours ago, did the transfer from Mt Gox to here and waiting for that to go through since they are having troubles now...<br /><br />So to sum up, worldbitcoinexchange is my new way to get BTC. Just sent them a bunch more today, they quote about 3 days for money to appear.<br /><br />Edit: money has transferred now. 9 hours from Mt Gox to here.

				Im not exactly sure about AUS, but here in USA, A MT Gox account does not need ID&#039;s for small infrequent transactions, and I mean 100-300 every couple of weeks. You need a verified account to make direct cash deposits, and to make large trades. Thousands is what Im saying. <br /><br />MT Gox probably is not supplying a stream of ID info to Itnerpol (they are a Japanese Corp with banking relationships in Hong Kong) - they will turn over customer info if warrants are issued by the Supreme Court of Japan&nbsp; &nbsp;

First off, have your bitcoin client connect to the bitcoin network through TOR. Then really SR dose the bitcoin laundering for you. You can also launder them yourself by rotating the TOR exit node&#039;s and sending them to a new addresses in your bitcoin wallet. On and on, there are may ways to scrub your identity form the bitcoins.<br /><br />Lastly, sure I don&#039;t thing bitcoin is a good long term investment. It is too unpredictable, however the high volatility makes it an excellent short term trading instrument. This volatility is do to many factors. One main reason is that the market brokers are not advanced enough i.e. most don&#039;t allow you to Short much, if at all, they do not allow mush Margin trading, nor any other advanced market features FX has (yes yes, I know some brokers do but it is not prevalent enough to be effective). (I am not going to explain to you how markets work in a forums post. You can learn that on your own.) Another big reason is simply&nbsp; because it is so new, in every interpretation of that phrase. The third big reason is that many of the people trading bitcoin no vary little, if anything, about trading. In any case, it dose not madder for you buying/selling on SR. Just buy the bitcoin right before you want to buy something on SR, but don&#039;t hold onto them. If you are a seller then you should cash out your bitcoins right away. That way you don&#039;t have to care about the value of bitcoin.

				There are no market makers in the bitcoin realm. A real exchange will have members that can take excess and place a interim floor under the trades. Also, there are no rules or SEC style authprity regarding dumping. I know that the beauty of a bitcoin market is its lack of centralization, but from the aspect of conversion and liquidity, you need to have a mechanism for shorting, margins, and other market making activities that one finds in real forex exchanges. I would like to see other virtual currencies traded against bitcoins too.<br /><br />Also, this is a very young market, it makes governments nervous. Tor makes them nervous. We are in interesting times. SR should be the cop&#039;s dream, a bunch of geeks in front of their computer, ordering drugs by mail, staying off the street and not beefing or shooting up the neighborhood.&nbsp; The world would be a better place if bitcoins, SR and all the wonderful liberties were unbound from the strictures of our wastteful political class. But nooooooo/<br /><br />anyhow. Bitcoins are in their infancy and we have no idea where it is going, and where it will all end up. A very smart person I know thinks that Bitcoins are phase#1 of the &quot;Great Banking disintermediation&quot;. what that means is just as the Web has made everyone a publisher, ebooks etc, And as the internet has allowed many middlemen to be eliminated and efficiencies to sprout up, Bitcoins are the beginning of a revolution in direct personal finance. <br /><br />No matter how they rise and fall, the smart money always goes in and buys. Wanna buy a bunch of cheap dope on SR, follow the coins down to the lows, buy em up, and sure as shit, they will get back up above 3.00 - its too far along for BTC to take one way trips to the low without rebounding.&nbsp; &nbsp; I get a kick each time there is a periodic low, and the stinkers come out of the woodwork and tweet the doom.&nbsp; I meanwhile buy, and usually make around .80 to 1.00. buys me a gram of M/
