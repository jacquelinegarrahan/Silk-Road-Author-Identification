				I&#039;ve used their service many times before. There are no fees. You actually pay less -%1 of the average. So you are actually paying less instead of high fees and all that. I do not know if they want to be publicy on Silkroad so that&#039;s why I&#039;m just posting information about them and just send me a message for their information. The only issue that deters people is there is a $500 minimum.<br /><br />Here is the process to get bitcoin:<br /><br />You need to of course have gpg.<br />You send them an email indicating how much bitcoin you want. <br />They respond with banking/instructions on where to deposit the money. Multiple banks. (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC)<br />You make the cash deposit. No signature required. I use the drive thru.<br />Scan/photo the deposit receipt to them and within an hour or two the bitcoin will be in your account you specified.<br /><br />You pay no extra fees, nothing extra at all. You actually pay less %1 on the average, so you pay less!<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried all the ways to get bitcoin. Every place charges outragous fees and even sometimes charge like $15 per bitcoin. That&#039;s robbery and really not worth your hard earned money. I&#039;m posting this because I don&#039;t want to keep seeing people getting robbed everyday and I think they deserve the business. They can even make $5000 bitcoin transfers if you want. I&#039;m in no way affiliated with them, just a happy customer and want to see them get good business from everyone.<br /><br />Just email me and I&#039;ll give ya the details on how to find out who they are. If you are smart, you can find them on your own pretty easy!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />You can email me at harryjay@tormail.net if you want.
