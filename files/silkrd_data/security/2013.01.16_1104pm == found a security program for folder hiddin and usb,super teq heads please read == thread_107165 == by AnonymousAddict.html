				So i downloaded this thing i found called a &#039;wise folder hider&#039; It seems pretty damn good, dnt knw how secure it is and would like some of the more teq guys to look into it..<br /><br />First when u run the program u have to add a password and its for hidding folders u dont want seen with content in them and also your USB. .. Iv tested it and im using it now and when i added my 2 usb ports that i have usb sticks in right now that r also now trucrypt if i try to access them by just going to my computer and hitting the name where i have the USB or the Letter i open and it shows no items in it... But soon as i go to the &#039;WISE FOLDER HIDER; AND enter my long password it opens up i click on what usb port i want unlock and it unlocks it only while i have it open, so i use what i need i close it and then, just like that its locked again..cant go and find any info on the USB without accessing the wise file hider first..<br /><br />SO Please guys go have a look and tell me how safe and secure it is... Also i think iv got my tru crypt on my main usb stick down cause i un plugged it thn went and plugged it into another computer and it shows NOTHING ON THE USB STICK.... SO is that correct??

				So let me get this straight; this program allows you to hide you files on your computer (or other device), or it encrypts it, and will only decrypt it with the right password?<br /><br />If so, that program really does sound useful. I&#039;ll go check it out and report what I find out.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.<br /><br />Firstly, it doesn&#039;t encrypt the data which means your data isn&#039;t really protected, it&#039;s just hidden out of the way somewhere. Computer forensics software will find it, as will anyone who is looking for it. This is &quot;security by obscurity&quot; and we quite rightly laugh in its feeble face.<br /><br />Secondly, it&#039;s a freeware application. You really need a free software for this sort of job, or at the very least open source. &quot;Freeware&quot; is software that is without charge, given to you as machine code that only your computer can understand. &quot;open source&quot; is software which can be downloaded as human-readable code (for some humans anyway, programmers) which can be compiled into machine code or audited by a programmer. Any security software which is not open source is worthless because its source code is a secret, you must assume that it&#039;s doing evil things behind your back; it cannot be trusted. This application relies on the folder hiding method being and remaining a secret.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to hide files and folders you ought to be using Truecrypt or some other tried and tested, trustworthy solution, even if it looks ugly. Using an app written by some kid to hide his porn collection from his parents is not a good idea, even if it does have a nice looking user interface.<br /><br />Unless of course you understand the risks and want to use it anyway, that&#039;s your call, but please don&#039;t use it for anything serious or recommend it to others.

				Thank u for that info...No it does not encrypt anything just hides it...Thats it... Im not a kid trying to hid porn iv got shit that could lock me away on my laptops...<br /><br />Im pretty sure my truecrypt is correct cause the port where i had the usb mounted ,when i toook that usb out and put it into another comp then it showed no info on it... does that mean its working&gt;and done right&gt;? IM still learning and studying more and much as i can with spare time, im just busy in collge, im&nbsp; in computer science, and i find that the underground world of computer hacking and all that teaches way more than college

				If you put a hidden volume on a USB stick and then moved it to another PC you shouldn&#039;t see it.&nbsp; You would have to use truecrypt to mount it.&nbsp; Although if the usb stick is 50 GB and only 30 GB are available when there is nothing on it, then that is a giveaway that something is hidden.

Well written and spot on. The software sounds like it works in a similar way to when you delete a file on your PC. Although the file seems to be deleted and the space it occupied is now available for use, the deleted file is still on your hard drive although effectively out of sight. The deleted data is written over when new files/folders are stored (movies, music, documents etc) or software programs are installed. Even when the old deleted files are written over numerous times, computer forensics have the equipment to recover most, if not all, of the deleted data, unless the hard drive is wiped with software such a dban.

				Truecrypt is a tried and trusted method to secure your system.&nbsp; Whether it&#039;s a HDD, USB flash drive, etc, Truecrypt will secure any of these devices in a combination of ways, depending on the level of security your seeking. It could be&nbsp; that you encrypt the entire hard drive, encrypt a partition on your HDD where the OS is not installed or create an encrypted file container which creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file. You can also run a USB drive in Portable Mode. All the info. on this is available on the Truecrypt website. :) :)

				To create an encrypted USB stick you can either install Truecrypt on your computer and use it to encrypt the drive; or put portable version of Truecrypt on the stick and create a container with a hidden volume. That way there is nothing on your laptop, and you could always claim to have found the USB stick in its current state.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have Truecrypt on your computer just go to Tools&gt;Traveller disk setup and follow instructions. Otherwise just download Truecrypt and instead of installing it just extract it to the drive you want to use.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then run the software and go to Tools&gt;Volume creation wizard. Choose &quot;create an encrypted file container&quot;, then &quot;Hidden Truecrypt volume&quot; then &quot;Normal mode&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will ask you where to put it. Choose your USB stick, next to the Truecrypt folder.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First you create an outer volume. I just used default algorithm etc. then choose the size of outer volume. This needs to be big enough for both what you want to hide and something you will use as decoy files to put in outer volume ( porn or something innocuous that you might want hidden)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create a password. This is the password you can give away under pressure. It will access the outer volume only. Then format the volume.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can now put the decoy files in place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next create the hidden volume. This needs to be big enough for your genuinely secret stuff.<br />This will have a different password.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Put your stuff inside it.<br />You now have a USB stick with Truecrypt and a file container. One password will open outer volume. There is no way of detecting the inner volume. If you want to alter the dummy volume without affecting the hidden volume you must mount it using both passwords.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you open the outer volume with one password, the hidden volume appears identical to empty space, so it&#039;s possible to overwrite it by mistake.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The main benefit of this system is there is no encryption software on your computer.
