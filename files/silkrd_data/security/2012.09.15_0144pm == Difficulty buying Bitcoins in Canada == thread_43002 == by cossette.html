				Having lots of trouble. Mt. Gox comes up in Polish. Liberty Reserve doesn&#039;t send me a password. Virtex (which seems questionable in any case) puts me into an infinite verification loop.<br />It&#039;s frustrating when you want to pay your way and deal with reliable people and you CAN&#039;T! Suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

				Hi I am in Canada and i use Virtex.&nbsp; at first I thought cool I can sit on my ass behind my computer and do this shit.&nbsp; I tried the online bill payment to transfer money....what a mistake they wanted my firstborn to complete the transaction there communication was great but they wanted to verify my identity. I decided that I would rather go into a bank with cash than provide my personal info to an online site so i have been using the cash method without any hitches.<br /><br />`<br />Cash Payment<br /><br />Unverified users can deposit cash in person at the banks shown below. We will not accept any online bank transfers. The deposits must be made in person and in cash or by Wire Transfer. Please also obtain a deposit reciept from the teller. This is not to be confused with online bill payments which requires you to be verified and that we do accept.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Please send us a cash deposit notice from the Deposit funds page prior to making the deposit. This amount must end in the last 2 digits of your account number as the number of cents. For example, if you wish to deposit $100 and your VirtEx Account number is 54223367, you must first send us a cash pay notice for $100.67 and then deposit $100.67 at the bank. This is an extra measure of verification used to ensure the funds are credited to your account. It is very important to tell the bank that you would like to make a direct deposit into the account, not a bill payment. Always keep your deposit slip as proof of deposit as we may ask for it to complete your deposit.<br /><br />Our bank details:<br />•For our Royal Bank<br />•For our Bank of Montreal<br />•For our ScotiaBank<br /><br />hope this helps <br /><br />

				cossette - stay away from Mt. Gox and Liberty Reserve for now till you learn more. Going through tor may mess things up for those services.<br /><br />I quite like CaVirtex, they&#039;ve worked well for me for under $1000 just follow their instructions, walk in to the bank and deposit the $ to their business account. The go log on in an hour or so you $ will be i n your Virtex account and the you buy some btc, wash appropriately and send to SR.<br /><br /><br />Buying BTC in Canada - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38853.msg435074#msg435074<br /><br />More info on Mt.

				Thanks. I have no problem with buying Bitcoins at my bank. So what I need for the bank is an account with a bitcoin exchange? I think that&#039;s my problem, as noted above - I can&#039;t seem to open one at Gox or Virtex. I suppose it doesn&#039;t matter whether the account is in Canada, except that there may be an exchange fee if it&#039;s not? (I.e., because an American exchange selling Bitcoins will want payment in American dollars.) And where does the bitcoin wallet come into this exactly? I&#039;m a slow leaner.

				I&#039;m also Canadian and new here and to the whole Bitcoin thing.<br /><br />I got a bitcoin.org wallet and it took a few days to download the blocks.<br /><br />I discovered that the Canadian Virtual Exchange www.cavirtex.com requires some paperwork and photo ID copies at the bank, so I didn&#039;t bother with them.&nbsp; Lazy me.<br /><br />With a simple phone call to my bank to set up a direct payment I was able to make 2 transfers from my online bank website into my wallet with www.canadianbitcoins.com and my regular email (check the SPAM folder) without even leaving home.&nbsp; It took a day for the bitcoins to be confirmed as transferred into my bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />Using my real name and a normal web browser, everything was legal up to this point.&nbsp; After this, prefer anonymity using Tor and a new alias to register on Silk Road, BlackMarket, their forums, TorMail, TorPM, etc.&nbsp; You can do business with bitcoins anonymously over the dark net but eventually you&#039;ll still need to give your trusted vendor a name and real address to be shipped to.<br /><br />I shopped around, decided what to get, and from my Silk Road shopping cart saw the bitcoin amount I needed to tranfer from my bitcoin wallet.<br />It took several hours to transfer from my bitcoin wallet to Silk Road to make my first purchase.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of any other options in Canada.&nbsp; FYI, I have no affiliation with those sites.<br /><br />That&#039;s my .02 - hope it&#039;s helpful.<br /><br />~RutGroove<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I searched &quot;Canada&quot; for secure shipment through customs tips &amp; info to discover several<br />Canadian Bitcoin Setup threads (for someone to consolidate?):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » In Canada, need help on How-to deposit bitcoins to ewallet?:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36189.msg413702#msg413702<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Difficulty buying Bitcoins in Canada:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=43002.msg467054#msg467054<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Help in Canada????!!!:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47493.msg500896#msg500896<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Silk Road discussion » Method you use to acquire bitcoins, Canadians only please.:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47841.msg502838#msg502838<br />Also, I posted this info here:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BlackMarket Reloaded - Forums → Newbie Questions:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=8<br /><br />FYI, here&#039;s an interesting post about shipping to Canada from a rogue Canadian Border Service Agent (CBSA):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11469.0<br />
