				They&#039;re crap. They don&#039;t work. If you use Windows, you should make a rescue disk now, because if you get infected with malware, the only way to be sure you get rid of it is to format the hard drive and do a clean reinstall of the OS.<br /><br /><br />Remember when a bunch of people got messages on SR saying that someone had recorded them getting drugs out of their mailbox, and they could view the video on some site? The site had a Java app that turned out to be malware.<br /><br />At the time, someone in our community clicked the Java app and got infected. He asked me what to do. I told him to format the hard drive and do a clean reinstall. He didn&#039;t listen to me, and instead spent 3 days removing the malware.<br /><br />Or so he thought.<br /><br />Today this person told me that he got the password reset for his SR account. I didn&#039;t know he had to reset his password, but he should have been suspicious from that alone, although he never mentioned it to me. When he logged in, all his BTC had been withdrawn. It was not a trivial amount of BTC.&nbsp; While talking to him, he rescanned his computer and found more malware. I experienced this myself when I infected a WinXP VM on purpose with the Trojan downloader on that site, &quot;cleaned&quot; it with an antivirus program, rebooted it and found the same rootkits.<br /><br />Since the malware came from someone targeting SR users, he got infected with it, and his account was later compromised, it is very like this is the thing that stole his login credentials. He adamantly denies it could have been a phishing site or other things, but in my experience, when people are 100% sure about something, that it absolutely could not have been something, most of the time they are wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, all this could have been avoided if he had done a clean reinstall.<br />

				Let me be more clear. You should make an actual disk, on read-only media, because a rescue partition can be infected too.<br />

				Like SS said, no Java in TorBrowser and JS can&#039;t deliver malware without the user clicking Run in a dialog.&nbsp; Lesson: People need to be mindful of what they are clicking.<br /><br />Everyone should set their NoScript to NOT Allow Scripts Globally (this is the TBB default so if you haven&#039;t manually changed it you need to). Then enable it on trustworthy sites like the forums.&nbsp; SR itself does not require JS to function.<br /><br />And since we are talking about potentially custom-created spyware/malware that targets SR users, reformatting/reinstalling is probably good advice.<br />

				most of this stuff is over my head, but I have a pretty good grasp of tor and pgp. I have recently been thinking about purchasing a cheap used laptop and just using it for usb-based VM platform tor browsing at public wifi spots. The problem is, no matter how secure you are technologically, the weakest link is the physical exchange of goods. You have to receive somewhere, on some regularity. Pattern recognition is how LE targets suspects, and unfortunately that&#039;s unavoidable.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I&#039;m sorry but you guys are 5-10 years behind where the bleeding edge of Malware is at the moment. And I&#039;m not just talking about another fucking Slavik ZuESS bot/trojan or some dumb Chinese APT threat. Go study the FLAME malware and you will understand how much of a beautiful piece of work it was, MD5 collision attack using new cryptographic attacks to break windows update.<br /><br />A Java 0-day is simple compared to some of the attacks out there but unless you piss off a few certain people or a 3 letter agency you don&#039;t have much to worry about. What you do have to worry about is fucktard&#039;s like VUPEN selling exploit kits to LEA to target certain user&#039;s as I&#039;m sure the FH job was done using a exploit kit made by a contractor.

If the NSA did this attack (and gave it their all) it would have found a way to fingerprint the OS people were using and target a specific payload to them, that then fingerprinted its environment to see if there was isolation or other security techniques, and then obtained other payloads to break through the isolation and disable each layer of security one at a time, prior to sending the information back to them. And it would have all been zero days, obfuscated and encrypted and probably never would have been detected in the first place. <br /><br />The FBI used a month old javascript exploit to deliver a payload that was targeted specifically to Windows 7 and to a lesser extent Windows in general, and it didn&#039;t even attempt to break out of isolation or disable any security features. The NSA has fucking cyber missles essentially, they will blow their way through ten layers of isolation in the blink of an eye. The FBI has always used already patched exploits, I have never read of a case where they did an attack like this with an actual 0-day, let alone tried to break out of layers of security. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Chinese APT threat</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A Chinese advanced persistent threat threat ;)?

This assembly code could have very well been used to download a secondary payload from a FBI server, the secondary payload could have been a program written in C, and after it downloaded it then it could have executed it and infected the system with a persistent backdoor. That is very common for hackers to do, javascript exploit to inject assembly code into the target computers memory and execute it, assembly code downloads secondary payload from the internet and executes it. The FBI didn&#039;t do that because they didn&#039;t need to and might have been restricted by the court from doing so, and instead they just used an assembly program that gathers mac address and hostname and sends it to a server outside of Tor. <br /><br />Yeah it was encoded in Magneto. I would call it malware because it compromised user security. I don&#039;t know what your definition of malware is, but if it requires a persistent infection then it could have been delivered by this attack as well, magneto would have just downloaded a secondary more complex compiled program and executed it.

				Just as a side discussion, I think it is kind of shocking how many javascript developers I meet who think that javascript can absolutely not be used to infect computers, that it is totally safe, cannot cause malware infections, etc. It is a really common belief apparently, and it is weird considering that an enormous number of the attacks against browsers are javascript based.

It just happened to anybody who visited any site hosted by freedom hosting.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The OP discusses malware downloaded via JAVA app exploit. A JS exploit did not seem to be the case based on the information provided in the OP.&nbsp; I stand by that statement.<br /><br />Freedom hosting is a different story, obviously it was a js exploit but I&#039;ve seen no evidence that there was malware delivered by javascript as you are contending.&nbsp; It was an exploit made possible by javascript.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the malware???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The malware is what gathered users hostname and MAC and sent it back to their server outside of Tor. It was delivered via a javascript exploit. They could have delivered any payload they wanted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If malware is defined as any computer instruction code designed for a malicious purpose then sure, you can call that malware.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t possible for server-side javascript to execute a compiled piece of software locally without human interaction though. <br /><br />In regards to the assembly code you quote.&nbsp; Where was this encoded in the script?&nbsp; Magneto?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is entirely possible for server-side javascript to cause a compiled piece of software to be executed on a remote machine, via a browser exploit. This assembly code could have very well been used to download a secondary payload from a FBI server, the secondary payload could have been a program written in C, and after it downloaded it then it could have executed it and infected the system with a persistent backdoor. That is very common for hackers to do, javascript exploit to inject assembly code into the target computers memory and execute it, assembly code downloads secondary payload from the internet and executes it. The FBI didn&#039;t do that because they didn&#039;t need to and might have been restricted by the court from doing so, and instead they just used an assembly program that gathers mac address and hostname and sends it to a server outside of Tor. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s important to remember that a javascript exploit would be needed for code execution in either case.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah it was encoded in Magneto. I would call it malware because it compromised user security. I don&#039;t know what your definition of malware is, but if it requires a persistent infection then it could have been delivered by this attack as well, magneto would have just downloaded a secondary more complex compiled program and executed it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The wikipedia definition of malware supports your definition.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Malware, short for malicious software, is software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems[1] . It can appear in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other software.[2] &#039;Malware&#039; is a general term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software.[3]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just as a side discussion, I think it is kind of shocking how many javascript developers I meet who think that javascript can absolutely not be used to infect computers, that it is totally safe, cannot cause malware infections, etc. It is a really common belief apparently, and it is weird considering that an enormous number of the attacks against browsers are javascript based. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Very true.&nbsp; Javascript itself is the biggest security threat when using a web browser.&nbsp; All users should be blocking scripts, not just in TBB but in your normal web-browser as well. <br />
