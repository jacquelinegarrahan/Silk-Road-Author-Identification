				From what I understand the secure methods take more than a week to complete but it is worth it to protect your privacy. A good way would be after you purchase your BTC legally to put them through a service that would mix them up into several accounts over several days for each account. These services charge fees but it is much safer than just transferring around your wallets. The more you do this the better your initial point of purchase is protected. It is not for people who are impatient and do not want to plan ahead accordingly. I would suggest people stop using fraudulent info when buying BTC initially. Buying BTC is not illegal and you are just adding more suspicion acting all weird at the cash depositing places. Once in a while people should buy some legal stuff at all the places that accept BTCs. The Bit Coins have a legitimate place in our capitalist society and we should not act all sketchy when buying them! The more people buy them the more acceptable it becomes in society and the more acceptable we become. Sorry, if I rant, I am sick and tired acting like I am a criminal, when I am not! Stay safe!
