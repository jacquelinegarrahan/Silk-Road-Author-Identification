				People there are to many complaints about bitcoins coming up missing after purchasing or sending money though money-gram ect. Or simply cashing in our Bitcoins for spendable cash without having to jump though so many unnecessary loops. Bitcoins suppose to be an anonymous currency but dealing in and out of Bitcoins aren&#039;t anonymous. So why deal with something that is anonymous but by the time you get done dealing with the shit its its no longer anonymous. So I think to take control of this situation WE here are SR need to pool in to create and open our own REAL ANONYMOUS Bitcoin exchange. I think this is a great I idea and will elevate all this trouble and headache that we have to go though by dealing with this not so anonymous currency. What are your thoughts about this?

				Uhhhh what...I think you might be misinformed on what and how an exchange works. The exchange I use doesn&#039;t know my real name or have any personal info about me.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t getting your bitcoins anonymously, you aren&#039;t doing it right. <br /><br />EDIT:<br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, im all for anonymity, the more the better. I don&#039;t think an SR backed exchange would work, and would tarnish the Bitcoins image. Exchanges ask for names, addresses, etc because they are businesses that are held to a standard by the government. How would you be able to accept money any more anonymously then any exchange or Monepak/WU vendor out there right now?

				I really would do it, if anyone could provide a way for me to accept anonymous payments that ensures whatever account(s) Moneypaks -- or whatever -- get credited to can&#039;t be frozen for cashing stolen stuff (actually I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s anonymous, since selling bitcoins is legal -- but you know, for the clients).<br /><br />I looked into it very seriously, and couldn&#039;t think of any way short of requiring a picture of the moneypak receipt.&nbsp; Hell, I&#039;d use character recognition to even read the thing, but some genius would figure out the first day that if you just hand printed any damn text it would accept it like a receipt&nbsp; &nbsp; :(<br /><br />(yes, I think what I do is obvious enough from the rest of my posts at this point if someone is actually looking)

				So whats the point in buying anonymous currency if you have to use your real identity? And the government agency&#039;s aren&#039;t stupid, SR isn&#039;t the only market to complete illegal transactions. There are several other markets that facilitate guns, drugs, and major illegal sex&nbsp; trafficking items. And to respond back to the lady about how she purchases bit coins...you have to remember buying moneypaks aren&#039;t all the way anonymous because all they have to do is pull the video of you purchasing the moneypak. And yes these exchanges have to follow government rules which are in place to maintain all transactions and find out who you are. There are other ways around this that aren&#039;t being pursued. My idea is to go those routes. I&#039;m not saying open a SR backed exchange but to have the SR COMMUNITY back the exchange knowing no questions will be asked.

				Bitcoins are not an &quot;anonymous currency&quot; per se, they are merely an alternative, non-state supported currency. A lot of people want to obtain and use them anonymously, but there&#039;s nothing in Satoshi&#039;s white paper that says they must be anonymous. So &quot;the point&quot; of bitcoin isn&#039;t anonymous payments. It&#039;s payments that are not controlled by government bureaucrats. Wordpress.com is a good example. They want to accept payments from people in Cuba and Iran, which are embargoed by the American government, so they started accepting bitcoin, because no government can block a bitcoin transaction.

It&#039;s simple, the blockchain is a ledger of every bitcoin transaction that&#039;s ever happened since it&#039;s creation. One can follow the transaction IDs to follow the trail all the way back to the person and/or exhange you purchased them from. Now granted this is a daunting task, and very unlikely to be followed through with... but bottom line is it&#039;s still possible. Under no circumstances should you ever reveal your identity when purchasing bitcoins.

				im not sure if thats 100% true.&nbsp; A bitcoin mixer is supposed to send your coins into a generic wallet and exchange them for different ones. therefor in the block chain it would look like you payed out another address, but the final address received completely new coins. and on top of that, the mixers pay out at different times and amounts so to not be associated with the original transfer.

But that does not mean they magically are untraceable. It is possible, not probable that they could trace the random coins you received back to the mixer, then correlate the total payout amounts to your address with the payment amount you sent to the mixer address and from there back to the exchange you bought them from. Now this would take an unimaginable amount of time and resources, but that does not mean it&#039;s not possible, just highly improbable.

				It&#039;s funny that I&#039;ve known about this site for months but am still trying to figure out how to safely use bitcoins. It&#039;s difficult because I can&#039;t know in advance which exchange or cash deposit location is going to attempt to verify the (false) information I give them, or if they will try and track me from there. I understand that it&#039;s not illegal to buy bitcoins but it elicits suspicion. Then there is also the risk of the bitcoins simply not showing up in my wallet.

People need to get rid of the mentality that simply shuffling coins makes them magically anonymous. It makes it infinitely more difficult to track, nothing more, nothing less. In that sense all mixers do their job as intended. Now if you couple proper anonyminity with proper mixing techniques they could &quot;theoretically&quot; track the coins all the way back to the exchange where you purchased them with bogus information. Then the trail stops cold.
