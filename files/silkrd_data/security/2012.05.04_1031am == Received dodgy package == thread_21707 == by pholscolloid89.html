				A domestic (UK) order I made came today, however the packaging was absolutely atrocious.<br />The envelope was tiny with handwritten address, and you could feel the bag through it. No doubt that postman now knows I am receiving drugs in post.<br />I am going to clean house, and put the bag back in the envelope. Not really sure what to do with it though.<br />Has anyone got any advice? Should I mention it to the postman or just bin it?

				Chill man!<br />Unless your postman is a pothead then I doubt he knows anything. Even if he is he wouldnt actually know the contents unless he opened it, which he didnt.<br />Burn the packaging, hide the product off your property for a while if you are concerned but try not to worry too much.<br />Out of interest which vendor was it? PM if you would prefer.

				Was there an odor that you could smell through the envelope and was it vacuum sealed?<br /><br />Keep it under your bed in case you get raided! The cops never look there!<br /><br />But no seriously, I think all orders should be stored at a different address then where they were delivered.&nbsp; Just good practice in my opinion.

Can&#039;t really store stuff at a different address on a permanent basis, but have moved stuff for now. <br />UK police won&#039;t raid over a postman reporting an envelope that felt like it had a baggy inside it anyway.

There&#039;s absolutely no reason to censor vendor account names... the rest of us need honest, legit reviews as often as possible. If this vendor has atrocious packaging, there&#039;s no reason you should even double check with him to see what he thinks about the situation. He fucked up and you really should let other people know who it is that sends using such a poor technique.<br /><br />Why even bother telling people about it if we can&#039;t use your story to decide what vendor to avoid?
