				I order from a reputable vendor not too long ago, but after 7 days of not arriving from a domestic vendor, he offered a re-shipment. That package has yet to arrive, nor has any of my 5 other orders from various vendors. As of late, it has been two days without mail in my mailbox at all. This is a little bit sketchy to me, as I am always receiving various mail. Is there a possibility I have been flagged perhaps?

				If LE intercepted 7 packages that contained illegal substances, wouldn&#039;t they have done something by now?

				All my orders are domestic. One was shipped the 13th, but never arrived, so vendor offered re-shipment the 19th, which I am still waiting on. Same with another product that was shipped the 17th. As well as one on the 20th and another the 21st. Guess I will wait and see.

				I&#039;d be paranoid, but that is just me.<br /><br />Remember: NEVER SIGN FOR A PACKAGE!<br /><br />I&#039;d probably hide my stash somewhere outside of the mailing address, so if a raid happens they can&#039;t do shit.<br /><br /><br />safe â‰  sorry

				Keep in mind its the Christmas season and mail delivery is going to be delayed.<br /><br />With that said, yes, I would definitely stay alert to the possibility that they did intercept one package, then started monitoring your mail to see what else might show up. <br /><br />But honestly, I would have to lean towards it simply being delayed or possibly diverted by some crafty USPS employee who either thought you might be receiving money or took one expecting money, discovered it was something they could have fun with and kept their eyes out for more.<br /><br />If it was intercepted, which is rare for domestic mail, you should receive a notice from them.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you get a notice to come pickup your mail or they come to the door asking to sign, I would definitely suggest saying you aren&#039;t aware of anything you were expecting that would require a signature and decline.<br /><br />For now I would just be patient and hope the packages have simply been delayed.<br /><br />Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone. :)

				Yeah, I&#039;m really hoping it&#039;s just slow shipping this time of year.

				I&#039;m outside the US and the average delivery times to my country have just gone over double the time they normally take (even though I prepared in advance) so I wouldn&#039;t be too worried .

				I&#039;d check other obvious things like....is the mail box itself is properly displayed or/and secured?&nbsp; It sounds stupid but mail didn&#039;t show up for a week before a roomate decided to mention we received a notice from the post that they wouldn&#039;t deliver any more mail until we fixed the mailbox.&nbsp; It was scary and funny they had a pile of drugs just sitting there.<br /><br />I also agree on having the house completely clean............including computer evidence.&nbsp; If you receive the packages, I&#039;d let them sit there for a couple of days, then dunk them in water (Maybe fowl up a tracking device), drive to a covered parking area (Optimal would be a building you could then hide immediately) all the while making sure you aren&#039;t followed.&nbsp; Then store the goods at another persons house and avoid any obvious unsecured communications.&nbsp; I would treat this as def com 5.
