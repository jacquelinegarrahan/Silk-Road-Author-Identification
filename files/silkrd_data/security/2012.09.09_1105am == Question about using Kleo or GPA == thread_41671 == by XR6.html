				Hi Guys,<br /><br />New to all this and I&#039;ve tried reading and researching before asking my question..... I have two issues.<br />I&#039;m using Kleo and have encrypted a number of messages through SR and received un encrypted reply&#039;s back so I feel I have it sort of worked out correctly. One issue is when I encrypt a message and save it to Windows notebook it save&#039;s it as a &quot;.txt.asc&quot; file (ASCII) which by all accounts is correct.... prob is I can never open it. I remove the &quot;.asc&quot; part and I can then open it, copy and paste into SR and away we go. Can anyone let me know why this is happening and what should happen......albeit I&#039;ve found a way around it.<br />Lastly I&#039;ve received my first encrypted message... I&#039;ve copy and pasted it in to notebook as a &quot;.txt&quot; file then go to Kleo to decrypt but it fails every time. I have a feeling I&#039;m saving it as an incorrect file or just not doing something correct...... can anyone assist.<br /><br />Also through the forums it&#039;s been suggested to uninstall Kleo and re install only GPA..... will this help.<br /><br />In summary, I have Kleo half way sorted but it may not be the best program to use and there are little hiccups along the way.<br />Thanking you in advance<br /><br />XR6<br /><br />

				your problem with .asc :<br />the reason you can&#039;t open this file in Windows with notepad this extension asc is not recognized by windows as associated with Notepad as text file. Go back to Windows explorer, find your file and when you click on it, a list of programs will open up and select Notepad as your viewer, click on the checkbox below to always use this program top open for this extension. you dont have to remove the .asc extension.<br /><br />your problem with kleopatra with the decrypted message:<br />Open your notepad, cut n paste your gibberish pgp message. then save it with a filename ending with .asc&nbsp; Go back to kleopatra and Decrypt your message.<br /><br />Don&#039;t uninstall kleopatra it is useful, until you learn the GPG Command Line, which is the most powerful tool of OpenGPG. If you managed to learn the commandline you can forget about all the screen graphical tools that is available or will be available in the future. Your knowledge of the commandline will translate to any operating system: windows, linux, Mac, etc.
