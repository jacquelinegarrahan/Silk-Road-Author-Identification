				I haven&#039;t made a single order from my home computer and was wondering if anyone else does this?<br /><br />I have access to another comp that is not inconvenient for me to place orders from. But I really doubt they would have any idea unless they were following me 24/7. <br /><br />If LE suspected you and got a warrant to check your house and computers they couldn&#039;t check anywhere else if they suspected the activity was happening away from the property could they?

				I order/browse from wherever I like. Less chance of shoulder-surfers at home, which is more likely than law enforcement breaking out of TOR.<br /><br />If you have a laptop with an SD card slot you can install tails on a micro SD and keep it hidden. They&#039;d have to do quite a thorough search to find a micro SD, they&#039;re tiny little things and can be hidden in the smallest of places.

Once shutdown signal is sent, RAM gets erased, installed hard drives never get touched, if anything needs to be retained from the session: put onto a encrypted USB, or send an encrypted e-mail to my Tormail.<br />-As of this point, I have not yet set up a bitcoin account, but my intention is to just set up a wallet from one of the online sites while either using my paid for VPN tunneled through Sweden (zero logs) or through Tor (haven&#039;t decided yet, more research on which would be better first)<br />-I personally have had enough experience sending items through the mail (largest ever was 3 pounds of bud, or 2k E-tabs if you consider that &quot;larger&quot;) so I&#039;m not so concerned about that aspect.<br /><br />But, I&#039;m till learning, and very open to people&#039;s suggestions (hence why I&#039;m here in the security forum.)<br /><br />Regards.<br /><br />-Bromine
