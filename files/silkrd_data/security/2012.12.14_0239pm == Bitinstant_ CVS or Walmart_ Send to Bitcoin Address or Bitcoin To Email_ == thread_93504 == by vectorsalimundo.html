				I haven&#039;t used bitinstant in a while and the last time I did there was only the coinapult option bitcoin to email. Is the Bitcoin Address a better safer option? Also can anyone who has tried both walmart and CVS which one is better for anonymity and ease of the transaction?

				blockchain.info, instawallet.org or similar btc wallet online to get your bitcoin address to deposit coins to.<br /><br />&nbsp;bitinstant to setup transaction, deposit to bitcoin address, use blockchain.info for a wallet that you can make multiple addresses (wallets) to send to. Wal-Mart is the best option imo, because you dont have to used that damned red phone and have to talk to Bahlilijihad to send your money. with wal mart you pick up a blue express payment moneygram form, fill it out somewhere other than wal mart, bring it back filled with fake info with zipzap recieve code and your unique account number of the bill to pay. Pay the money and when you get home it&#039;ll be in your blockchain wallet. from there move your coins to a few different wallets to lauder (wash) your coins before finally taking them from the last wallet you sent them to to your SR bitcoin address. before you do so make sure you press get a different address just to make sure its fresh. It&#039;ll take 1-5 hours but it&#039;ll show up. good luck<br /><br />EDIT: IF they ask for ID, they&#039;ve never asked before why yall askin now.

				I always use Walmart to bitcoin address. Ive done this numerous times and have had no problems whatsoever. Ive never been asked for ID and for this reason i always go to walmart. i usually deposit to bitcoin fog and my coins are almost always there by the time i get home.

				I just deposit straight to my SR address. I&#039;ve found that Walmart is the most time-efficient, safest location to deposit rather than CVS.

				My associate and I have used Wal Mart multiple times in order to make the transfer, however, the past few times we HAVE been asked for ID. After the initial request, I refused to continue until an explanation was given (having done this multiple times with the same employee I was rather confused). Its dependent upon the store&#039;s policy, they can ask for it if they want. Why, I&#039;m not sure. We&#039;ve had no problems with the one we use currently (We quit using the above mentioned location after a second try).

				Blue Sky Traders seems to be the safest, cheapest route.
