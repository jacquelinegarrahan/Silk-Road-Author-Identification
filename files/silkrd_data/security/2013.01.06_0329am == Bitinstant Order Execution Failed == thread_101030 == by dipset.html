				So just got a order execution failed notice on a bitinstant transaction at walmart. The first one went through just fine, used same name and info for the second one (as I have before) to get just over the five hundred a transfer limit in eventual coins, and the second one got fucked up. I ignored the birthday section and just processed the second slip without entering the same birthdate for the second zipzap payment slip with the same name. I am now thinking this is the issue. Either way, anyone with experience know how long this will take for support to push through their system? I already emailed them about it, it just will be annoying if I have to wait until Monday to get this resolved. Should&#039;ve been more patient and waited for Blue Sky and banks to open on Monday. Also, wanted to mention that when talking to lady at Walmart processing my two payments she mentioned that the system searches for accounts/people by the phone number they write on the moneygram slip. Thought this was interesting if processing payments with a fake name or trying to skirt the transaction limit while using your real info phone numbers may play a factor or show inconsistencies. Just FYI and complaining, fucking bitcoin.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I processed both payments successfully at Walmart, two payments, two different amounts, two different btc addresses. Whilst processing the second payment slip on bitinstant, I think I may have neglected to enter anything into the birthday section and there was a mismatch somewhere thus causing this hangup. I have read here that certain things can set off some kind of automatic fraud detector, as with processing duplicate amounts one after another, etc. Either way there seems to be more issues arising with bitinstant since they implemented stricter AML procedures, i.e. the whole name DOB thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, already contacted by email. They likely will not get to it until Monday, unless they have someone doing checking customer service inquiries on Sundays. So that is kinda a bitch.

				Don&#039;t know if I want to get that into it unless I have to, but thanks Captain you&#039;ve been very helpful.

				The same thing happened to me a few days ago. It took a few emails but it worked out ok. Although it took just under 24 hours total, once they let me know they were aware of my problem it did get resolved within the hour. So don&#039;t worry too much - BI customer service will take care of it once you reach them. Calling is probably faster but remember to block your phone number. They don&#039;t need to see your real info.
