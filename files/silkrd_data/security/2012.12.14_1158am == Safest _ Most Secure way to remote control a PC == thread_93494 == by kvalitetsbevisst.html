				In you experience, what is the best setup to remote control a PC over the internet?<br /><br />It could be either a remote control method for a Linux or Windows PC, the only criteria I have is that I need a GUI (not a basic SSH shell).<br /><br />If anyone has any reccomendations, please let me know :)

				Google TeamViewer.<br />Easy, free, reliable, many features. <br /><br />Edit: I overlooked the &quot;secure&quot; part, dumb suggestion

				It has crossed my mind, but I&#039;m not really sure if I feel safe using that one.<br /><br />A complex password might help me along the way though .. but for some reason it just feels strange relying on TeamViewer :p<br /><br />Is there any way to get a GUI remote through the SSH protocol, though? I&#039;d be more comfortable using something that I can set up for my self and where the traffic only goes from one computer to another (over an encrypted tunnel on the internet, of course).

				Use something open source and independent of third party servers. I don&#039;t know how teamviewer works but I would use VNC viewer/server through an encrypted tunnel.

				TeamViewer (and all proprietary software for that matter) sucks massive donkey dick and is definitely not safe. Use VNC and tunnel it through SSH. That solution is cross-platform too so it&#039;ll work on Linux, Windows, Mac and even Android.
