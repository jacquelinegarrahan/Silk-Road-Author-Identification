				The recorded IP address will be that of the Tor exit node you&#039;re using. Not your real IP address.

				Have you tried tormail.net? Seems like the most annonymous email you can get. Has a good web interface too.

				Google also aren&#039;t going to like anonymity -its their goal to identify you, your stats and how to direct services that might be of interested to you {to coin a phrase}<br /><br />i can&#039;t find the exact text right now but the summary was....&quot;everything within the tor network is encrypted, but cannot guarantee that once the data leaves an exit or is outside tor ie Google, that it would be as secure as within tor..&quot;<br /><br />

Every now and then, Google will also ask you to identify that you are the account holder. This is done by, for example, making you type in the name of the city you were in when you signed up for the account. But to answer your question; yes, you can use Gmail with Tor and there will be no trace of your real IP address.

				I have always gone by the rule of keeping my real life as far away as i can from sr.&nbsp; That way my denial of anything cannot be diprovin (as easily).No reason to be anonymous on gmail because you shouldn&#039;t have it connected in any way to sr.

				Gmail and Google is for your mainstream activity ONLY.<br /><br />Tormail, Tor, AND browsing on Duck Duck Go is the better option for here. <br /><br />You will need to turn safe search off and select &#039;World Traveler&#039; as your location for best results in duck duck go. They never track or bubble you. <br />There are other neat options for further stealth on DDGo have a look.<br />It is slow (because it is deep) but you are a ghost.<br />Happy surfing!

				Do not use google services with tor. That&#039;s counterproductive. Google seeks to track and record you in order to deliver their products. They&#039;ll try to prevent you from accessing their stuff with tor, anyway, and you certainly don&#039;t want clearnet services connected to your tor endeavors.

				no matter what you do to encrypt your communications back and forth between yourself and gmail&#039;s servers.....<br /><br />those servers store your mail. even if you downlaod it all and then delete it from google&#039;s servers.<br /><br />Do you trust google with your mail?<br /><br />Google are well know for collaborating with the feds as required.<br /><br />I was gonna show you a few links from when google hired ex feds for their senior management related to security and gmail......<br /><br />But I can&#039;t find them right now when i do a google search - lol surprised?!?<br /><br />Anyway - the bottom line is that google is NOT secure.<br /><br />If you require absolute security, then do not use gmail, or be logged into a google account while using the net.<br /><br />Having said that, I use gmail myself on a daily basis - I am not so worried that I forgo the benefits of gmail....<br /><br />But if I have communications that I absolutely need to keep private, then gmail - no way.<br /><br />As always, you need to do your own research and perform your own cost /benefit analysis to determine the level of security you need. There is no one size fits all solutions.<br /><br />HTH,<br /><br />Ed<br /><br />
