				So I regularly use BitInstant to fund my accounts.&nbsp; Tried to use it today through Blockchain and it keeps giving me an error after inputting my information.&nbsp; So I went directly to the BitInstant site and just input my information using a guest account and it worked and sent the payment slip to my email.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone else still using the cash deposit through them as of now?&nbsp; I know they were doing something and have problems recently, just don&#039;t wanna get money tied up and end up losing it.

Just curious, @Boostedh, did they ask you for ID when you went to pay cash? I&#039;ve read that some people are getting asked for ID now

				I left, to many personal questions came up, they have some type of database that knows where you live and who you live with. I have left for good! Since you said moneypak, well here I come! Thank you!
