			<dd class="postbody">
				I ordered some pot, a small amount of it, and it took 14 shipping days to get to me. It was sent priority mail. <br /><br />So, I go to pick it up at my PO box under my real name pretty late at night. Basically the town is dead and I only saw 1 or 2 cars on my way there. It was before 11PM too. That is the way it always is here.<br /><br />Across from my mailbox is a small mall with a few stores, they are all closed other than one fast food place that is empty but lighted up. Above all the stores and around them are apartments, so there were 20-30 cars in the parking lot like always. Before walking into the store for my tiny amount of weed I looked around to see if there were any cops, I had never waited 14 days for a priority mail shipment in probably 100&#039;s of legit and illegal shipments over the last few years. So I was skeptical that something was up. I didn&#039;t look around as much as I should of, I just looked through the back of my car and in the mirors for a few seconds.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see a soul around so I go in and grab my package and walk out, I was in there for 30 seconds tops. As soon as I am walking out the door I see a fucking cop car staring right at me. 180 degress, in that dead parking lot. My heart sinks and I am just like fuck. This guy came out of fucking no where. The cop then turns and drives away. Just like that out of nowhere.<br /><br />I was so fucking scared driving away that I was going to see the blue lights but I never did. <br /><br />Because of this, I am now asking what I should do. This really freaked me out to see this cop just pop out of nowhere and come out of a parking lot that I have never seen them come out of (I go to that area for other reasons late at night often, and have never seen a cop in that actual parking lot)<br /><br />I am thinking of only ordering weed there for the next few shipments but I am running empty on the drugs I really rely on.&nbsp; On top of that if I got a CD to my house I would be fucked for a long time. (I need to open another thread on how to hide some of the stuff)<br /><br />Could anyone offer advice on if I am just being too paranoid or if I should be fraked like I am?<br /><br />

				If I were a cop in an empty town and I saw some shifty looking guy doing anything, anything at all, I&#039;d watch him.&nbsp; Especially when he stops to look around like he&#039;s going to rob the place.&nbsp; Like what else do I have to do?... not like there&#039;s anyone else around anyhow.<br /><br />Who else goes into that post office that late?... probably nobody.&nbsp; Maybe somebody that wanted to break in and steal shit would go in that at that hour, but not an upstanding 9-5 every day sheep like person from that area.&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re all sleeping.<br /><br />TL;DR&nbsp; <br /><br />You look suspicious.&nbsp; Maybe you should try fitting in a bit better.

There was not enough time for him to go in and then out, he had to be sitting in the parking lot. I suppose you could say that he had nothing better to do and was just sitting in his car, possible but unlikely.<br /><br />It was just marijuana, I don&#039;t give a shit about that. I just get nervous that they will bring the dogs into my house and find some more serious stuff.

				Idk man.<br /><br />If they were onto you, you&#039;d be busted by now, right?&nbsp; And you&#039;re not.&nbsp; And I seriously doubt they&#039;re going to set up a month long operation to watch you over an 1/8 of dank or whatever misdemeanor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like how do they know you&#039;re more serious stuff?<br /><br />Toss on some Marley and just think positive or something... clean house if that makes you happy.<br />

				I think you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />Think about it... cops get bored, especially in the type of city you&#039;re describing. He probably got excited and thought you were trying something fishy. When he saw that you were just grabbing mail, his &quot;hopes&quot; probably died down, no reason for him to be there anymore. If it was for your mail, the authorities in your area wouldn&#039;t just give themselves away to you like that.<br /><br />This is just my opinion. There&#039;s a ton of reasons why that cop could have been there. The chances are slim that it was because of the weed you&#039;re getting in the mail.<br /><br />If you want to be extra extra careful, just wait a little extra time before having something delivered there. Or, try picking up your mail at &quot;normal&quot; hours to make yourself look less fishy. :P

				That cop was probably fucking a hooker in a dark secluded parking lot, or his partner, or just patrolling. <br /><br />Go on craigslist and get a cheap suite in a house for rent (because apartment buildings have cameras), and use fake ID or go sublet with somebody as a roommate and don&#039;t use any ID. Don&#039;t drive directly to it (possible GPS tracker on car) and don&#039;t bring your phone inside because it&#039;s also tracking you. Wrap up all your drugs there and store them in smell proof containers/bags.

				Thought you trying to break in would be my guess. Took a good look, saw you didn&#039;t have a crowbar and balaclava so left.<br /><br />Simples. Easiest explanation is usually the right one.

				You are all probably right.<br /><br />They are around this town like flies at night, for no reason ofcourse.<br /><br />That is the last of me picking up my mail late at night, from now on I will go at normal times and blend in. Also, I am going to go buy some sort of jar and bury my stash right before I go from now on. <br /><br />Thanks all for the advice, just paranoia that I can easily overcome.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry to much about it.&nbsp; IDK what your laws are but a package of weed won&#039;t land you more than an hour in jail where i come from.&nbsp; Besides if he was going to do something it would have already been done.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t order to that PO box anymore and honestly, if you can&#039;t find pot locally, your not asking the right people.<br /><br />Anyways, i wish you luck, and stay safe!<br /><br />Edawg420<br /><br />
