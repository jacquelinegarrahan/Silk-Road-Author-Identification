				Has BitItnstant been working for everyone?<br /><br />I use the cash deposit method deposited to a BTC address. I placed an order a while ago and still nothing... Wondering if anyone here has had recent experience with BitInstant and did it go as usual? How long to get your cash? How long ago did you do it?<br /><br />Thanks in advance guys

				Hello--<br /><br />Some people are having problems with BI and other are not. I hope you re in the are not category. I also heard that they were going to stop taking USA payments for 2 weeks.<br /><br />I have no idea id any of this is true. But if it turns out to be and any of you need 800+ in btc. I charge no fee. I cover the Fee WU charges...and I sell the coin at the exact price it is when we are ready to Finnish the deal.<br /><br />So for example you send me $850. WU charges you $76. So that is $926.00. When we are done..I will send you $926 in btc to SR. And the other good news is that if the rate on SR is 111.12 then you will get 111.12&nbsp; as the&nbsp; conversion rate. And we do that as the last moment of the deal..so if the btc changed in the 30 min this takes,,,no worries as you will get the best rate and&nbsp; you will have at least 15 min to shop at that rate....before it changes. <br /><br />Also I have been a vendor for&nbsp; over 1 year...and been doing this over a year...Both have nothing but 5/5 feedback. Both on the item(selling btc for cash) and on my vendor profile) <br /><br /><br />So please check it&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a901074cb3<br /><br /><br />And if you have any questions..message me on SR..THANKS for your time.

				They recently (as I&#039;m sure everyone who uses them is aware) were not accepting US cash transfers for a short time, but have been again since they re-did their policy or whatever to where you have to create an account with them (or use as guest - but like Cabinman01 mentioned, I couldn&#039;t get it to work either as &#039;guest&#039;).<br /><br />But, since I made an account with them, has gone very smoothly.&nbsp; Only snag I ran into was that when I set up the account, I accidentally and unknowingly transposed two letters of the last name I gave them, so that since they just recorded it as I had given them, my transfer kept getting rejected with an error message to MG that the last name was wrong.&nbsp; Fortunately, the WalMart lady had a good eye and she noticed where the discrepancy was and then entered in the misspelled name and the transaction went through just finel.<br /><br />Sorry to the OP if you are still having problems... hope you got it straightened out....
