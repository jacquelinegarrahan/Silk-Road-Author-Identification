				Use the search feature on the forum. There&#039;s various links and I think in the sticky perhaps. Search around, and there are specific options to learn to use.

				First, after taking the picture and placing it on your computer, delete meta-data associated with it. (Google)<br />Then you must upload to an anonymous upload service that doesn&#039;t record your IP (couple TOR hidden services provide this).<br /><br />As far as the taking of the picture, do so against a white wall. If paranoid, take picture against a different colored/textured background such as taking a picture of your product with a poster board behind it.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				Make sure GPS tagging of pictures is disabled on your smartphone, and also use a 3rd-party program to remove EXIF data. Also open the pic in Paint, edit a single pixel, and save.
