				Hello everyone. I posted a similar question a week ago, with no help. <br /><br />I would like to accept moneypak for payment. But the problem is that in order to use the moneypak, I need to either load it onto a GreendDot card (which requires name, ssn, and addy) or I need to deposit it into paypal acct (which also requires name, addy and ssn).<br /><br />I understand there are vendors on SR who sell this info. So i was wondering...<br /><br />Could I buy personal info on SR (name, addy, ssn) and use that info to activate my GreenDot debit card, and then just deposit funds into it via moneypak&#039;s website? Then I could withdraw the money from an ATM right?<br /><br />How safe is it? How would I get caught?<br /><br />I know some people here do bitcoins for moneypak exchanges, but the fees are a bit expensive for me. And i&#039;ve already been ripped off once. <br /><br />Please help..

				Are you saying you want to become a vendor here and accept MP as payment for your products/services?&nbsp; If that&#039;s what you&#039;re saying, that wouldn&#039;t work - unless you are a bitcoin vendor, you cannot accept other forms of payment.&nbsp; If you did, then those buyers wouldn&#039;t be able to use the escrow service&nbsp; and wouldn&#039;t be protected.&nbsp; And if you, the vendor, were to be scammed, SR support wouldn&#039;t be able to do anything to help you because they do not support out-of-escrow dealings.<br /><br />

				Transfer to PayPal.&nbsp; PayPal can verify with a MoneyPak, and can deposit funds to it.&nbsp; So, just find one of the many ways to turn BTCs into Paypal currency, and you&#039;re golden.<br /><br />Make sure it&#039;s a stealth account (PP).&nbsp; And, use that MoneyPak to verify, and nothing else.&nbsp; Nothing linking you to the account.&nbsp; And, if you don&#039;t know how to proxychain a socks5, you&#039;re going to screw up the anonymity side of this, anyway.&nbsp; So, just make sure the BTCs aren&#039;t &quot;dirty.&quot;&nbsp; Forget what I said about &quot;stealth account&quot; unless you know how to anonymize your IP address.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ask; there are wikis for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />sleepy<br />TorChat: qsy3fzzvw6ug6wbi
