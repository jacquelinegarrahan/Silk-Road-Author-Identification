				Hello everybody,<br /><br />as a recent newcomer on SR from the EU, i want to share my experiences on how to use SR&#039;s services easily, quickly and anonymously as i think it might be helpful for other newcomers who may feel a bit lost at the very beginning as it was my case. <br /><br />Assuming you&#039;re reading my post on SR&#039;s forum, i&#039;ll skip the part about downloading Tor and opening an SR account to go straight to the first main question: how to get bitcoins quickly, easily and anonymously. You must have already read all the technical posts which advise you to create either a dwolla account, then a Mount Gox&#039;s one or neteller or bitinstant, and finally a bitcoin wallet, or to create a Second Life account, then a neteller&#039;s and a virwox&#039;s, or any combinaison thereof. And you may, like me, have found this a bit puzzling - though it is actually not that difficult. But i found there was a few hiccups with these proceedings as firstly at the beginning you still have to make a bank transfer from your personal account to Dwolla or Second Life or else (which obviously can be whitewashed through the successive transfers but still you have to use your personal bank account at least once); secondly dwolla, Mount Gox and others now forbid the use of Tor to connect to them; thirdly they make credential inquiry about you; lastly it takes quite a long time, eventually several days, both to be validated and to receive the bitcoins from one account to another... <br /><br />For all these reasons and because i wanted to be able to receive totally anonymously and instantly bitcoins on my SR account without any intermediaries, or the least possible, i choose to proceed differently using the exchange service of a trusted SR vendor. For that purpose, i first bought a Ukash voucher with cash at the press and tobacco shop next to my house (actually a bit further to be sure nobody will know me while buying it); second i got connected onto SR and asked my trusted vendor (which i found after reading all the posts on SR&#039; forum concerning exchange services and the feedbacks on his profile) if he was online, had enough bitcoins and was ready to proceed to the exchange right now; third - if his answers were positive - i sent the Ukash&#039; s voucher&#039;s code (he also accept paysafe card by the way); lastly a few seconds later my SR account was credited with the corresponding amount of bitcoins to the euro sum on my Ukash&#039;s voucher.<br /><br />I was hence now ready to purchase any stuff i wanted on SR. Being in the EU, i choose a vendor who was also living in the EU as the sending would be quicker and safer than from overseas. For my drug of choice, and actually for most kind of drugs as he is also selling most of them and have as good reviews about them from other buyers as mine about my drug of choice, i found that Netherlands was the right place to go. Then again, i checked carefully the credentials through SR forum and feedback on profiles of all the concerned vendors before picking up one (still even doing that thoroughly cannot always prevent you from getting scammed as the case of another before-famous-now-infamous vendor from Netherlands too&nbsp; which i was contemplating to deal with before finally luckily choosing the other one recently demonstrated). I happened to do just the right choice as ever since i&#039;ve been dealing with the same vendor with no reason to complain at all, neither about the quality, the quantity, the packaging, the delivery and the communication. Exactly three days later, i received what I longed for through a totally anonymous procedure from the beginning to the end (as i didn&#039;t use my personal address).<br /><br />I would call my way to proceed on SR the &quot;Holland Connection&quot; as both vendors, first for the bitcoins then for the H, are located there. To name them, the first one is AmsterdamShop and the second one c63amg. They are both great trustworthy vendors whom i warmly recommend as i will myself always go on dealing with them for all my buys in the future. They offer great communication, great services and great products. Regarding their services and listings, just check out their profile on SR to get all the information needed. And if you need more guarantee than mine, just check out all the numerous feedback on their profile and all the topics in which they are mentioned on SR forum. I can assure you, you won&#039;t be disappointed!<br /><br />I hope that this post will be helpful for some of you who are new to SR, that it will make your beginning here smoother and help you find your own way across this wonderful world! Don&#039;t hesitate to ask if you need any further information, besides i&#039;ll be grateful for any feedback, comment and advice regarding the content of this post.<br /><br />Thanks by advance<br /><br />All the best to all of you<br /><br />Cheers to SR
