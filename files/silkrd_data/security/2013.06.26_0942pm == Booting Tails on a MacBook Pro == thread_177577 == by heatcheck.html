				I use a MBP as my everyday laptop. I successfully installed Tails on a USB but I cannot get it to boot on my laptop. When I put on rEFInd, I can start the boot but it stops on a black screen with a blinking underscore and never moves further.<br /><br />Does anyone boot Tails on a Mac running the latest OS? If you do, how do you do it? <br /><br />Any and all help is so greatly appreciated.

				I tried for a long time to get tails running on my macbook pro and also on a macbook.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed rEFind like you did and i had the exact same problems you reported.&nbsp; I was not able to get tails running from a USB with a persistent volume, i could not figure out what the problem was.&nbsp; <br /><br />I finally just burned the tails disk image to a DVD and ran it from the disk.&nbsp; Tails runs a little slower from the disk, but its not a huge issue for me.&nbsp; I also made an encrypted flash drive that i used as a persistent volume so i can save PGP keys and other info.<br /><br />If anyone is able to run tails from a USB on a macbook please share.&nbsp; My setup is ok, but i would love to have everything on the same USB drive.

				X3. <br />I have a post on here somewhere about this. I need to find it to see if there have been any updates. ATM, I am running a VPN &gt; Virtual Machine &gt; Tails &gt; TOR. <br />Don&#039;t have a persistent volume, but everything that I need to know is in my brain or saved in anonymously created email accounts in case I forget anything.

				I&#039;m having similar issues. I can get Tails to boot up just fine on my Dell, and I set up&nbsp; persistent volume no problem. But when I stick the USB key in my MacBook Air that I use for work stuff it wont boot. I tried it on an old MacBook too, and its a no go. It seems like the problem has to do with the Mac&#039;s firmware - it doesnt support booting anything that&#039;s not MacOS from USB. <br /><br />If there&#039;s any way to get it to work, I would think that the way to do it would be to format the USB stick in a way that the Mac likes before installing Tails on it. Unfortunately Tails doesn&#039;t offer a lot of customization options when it comes to installing on the USB stick.<br /><br />Anyone know how to do that using the command line?

				Has anyone found a solution to this? <br /><br />I am able to downloaded ISO and burn onto a DVD however I am trying to install the latest tails onto a USB so I can configure persistant volume but cant get it to work.<br /><br />I have rEFInd working on mac for a start, I follow all instructions but cant get beyond this point...<br /><br />Download syslinux.<br />Double click on the package to extract it.<br />Copy isohybrid.pl from the /utils folder to the desktop.<br />Copy the ISO image (for example tails-i386-0.17.1.iso) to the desktop.<br /><br />To change directory into the desktop, execute:<br /><br />cd Desktop<br /><br />Has anyone else had any luck with this???
