				I&#039;m a dutch vendor and im looking for the quickest way to transfer BTC to euro&#039;s. I dont require finalizing early, and as such, have a huge buffer in escrow. <br /><br />As of now, it usually takes a week before the package is received, then another week to MtGox &gt; EU Bank account. a 2 week bridge is quite some time when you&#039;re selling a lot of product. I&#039;ve already bought 3 kilo&#039;s out of my own pocket, and you know, my own pocket is running low. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of intersango, and transferred some BTC to it and waited for them to transfer to my account, it still hadn&#039;t started processing after 3 full days, so I cancelled the bank withdrawal. I&#039;ve now found AurumXchange, and im waiting for them to send me my prepaid load card, but thats another 1000$ a day limit..<br /><br />Any help is appreciated, im going bankrupt if you dont, lol.

				I will use BTCBuddy to cash out my BTC. I send him the&nbsp; coins and he sends me a insured parcel of $50&#039;s :)

				Can you convince your vendors to allow you to pay them with Bitcoins?<br /><br />That would solve all your problems.

				You can use Okpay to directly add coins and withdraw with an ATM card, I think aurumxchange offers the same thing.<br />Can also just sell for western union or something to anybody on bitcointalk.org forums or #bitcoin-otc IRC channel<br /><br />Intersango is your best and most secure option. Pretty sure it&#039;s run by bitcoin devs in Europe so not only will it be the most secure but also the most private. Plus then you use your own bank account which is slightly better than anonymous ATM cards since after repeated use they start to track down foreign issued cards. That&#039;s the best part about bitcoins, you can anonymously cash them into your own bank account and claim it was profits from wherever you want... no way to link them to drugs. Would have to pay taxes tho<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Netherlands to trace &quot;black&quot; credit card payments<br /><br />Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees De Jager instructed the Tax Department, on 8 June 2010, to trace payments with anonymous &quot;black&quot; credit cards in the Netherlands. This concerns special credit cards and pin debit cards linked to bank accounts in tax havens that are not reported to the Tax Department and, it is claimed, account for hundreds of millions of euros of undeclared funds.<br /><br />The Tax Department is currently in discussion with organisations processing credit card payments in the Netherlands to trace people who own these cards. De Jager said: &quot;It is inconceivable that people buy expensive things anonymously through foreign bank accounts and at the same time try to dodge tax. The Tax Department ruthlessly tackles this type of fraud. When caught the fine can be as much as at most 300%.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
