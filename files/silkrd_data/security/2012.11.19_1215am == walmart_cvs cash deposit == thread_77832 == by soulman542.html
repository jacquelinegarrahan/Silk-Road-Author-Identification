When you use the exchange the rate will depend on current market conditions, and it will be transferred as BTC, escrow is only after you place an order (so when your coins get released it is the same value as when they where put into escrow)

				Walmart CVS cash deposit to whom??? No mention of how order for said btc was initiated. The only that I know of the &quot;used to&quot; be discreet, was BitInstant, who now makes you put in your birthday and Phone number, when you choose BTC to email. Prior to this, I would have the occasional clerk ask for my ID, as she was putting my cash into the &quot;middleman&quot; company ie; TrustCash or ZipZap, then usually you&#039;d get an email link to use Catapult, and there you could put your btc wallet code from SR.&nbsp; Now if you&#039;re OK giving them your DOB, AND showing your drivers license, I&#039;m not so sure it matters how encoded SR is. - Just like PGP, if LE is observing your transactions via hanging out at your ISP office, with a warrant to watch all BTC sales. They will see your PGP code, the PGP code of the Vendor, and the whole transaction. - I think as long as you keep it &quot;small potatoes&quot;, as in personal usage amounts, within reason. your chances are better that this whole paranoid scenario won&#039;t happen. - <br /><br />Bottom line, you&#039;re taking a chance. How big a chance depends on how big the order. How brazen you appear.&nbsp; With LE cutting manpower, and the economy worsening with each passing day (In US anyway), I don&#039;t expect any $ being put into LE to start an investigation. <br /><br />Then again I could be wrong. <br /><br />That&#039;s my two-cents. <br /><br />I now use MT Gox, and an &quot;off site&quot; BTC wallet provider, that doesn&#039;t care much about your personal info. <br /><br />Good luck!

				Well about the PGP thing, you may be right. I&#039;ve just seen someone&#039;s computer activity monitored real time, from a central office, and you can see them switch browsers, everything. So I figured, if they recorded hours of someone, they could see everything that person saw. - Though that IS off the topic, and sorry for the side track.<br /><br />As far as BitInstant, a place I grew to love over this past summer, before they made the phone number + DOB a stipulation.&nbsp; - I figured, why ask, if they can&#039;t verify? <br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely right though. You certainly can use a phony DOB. I just thought if they added that feature, then they would ask for it upon payment. <br /><br />I believe you if you say it can be done with fake DOB&#039;s and such. I will try this next time I go shopping on the road, and report back. <br /><br />Can&#039;t be too paranoid these days. I guess I was though. BitInstant sure was a hell of a lot easier than Mt Cox. - Thanks for alleviating my paranoia. <br /><br />The more I visit this forum, the more I learn. Thanks CaptainMal

				Went to bitinstant.. Put in the amount and found a local CVS... Walked in picked up the red phone on the counter, gave a number, name and address over the phone.<br /><br />Went to the register and after a few tries it worked fine. The person kept putting in the wrong amount. Paid the cash and walked out. Drove home, ate dinner and checked.. All there in the mtgox account. Now that I know the process I see it getting easier.<br /><br /><br />I used my real info because buying bitcoins is not illegal in any way shape or form.

				i do a cash deposit at CVS directly into my SR wallet.&nbsp; honestly, its just a pain in the ass to send them to a wallet and then to SR.<br /><br />i do the bitinstant stuff at a starbucks, use an email account i&#039;ve only ever accessed through TOR, and use fake info at CVS.&nbsp; so i see no reason not to go directly into SR.&nbsp; silk road has built in tumblers and i don&#039;t believe someone could discern from the bitcoin receiving address that it was associated with silk road.&nbsp; plus i get a new btc address for my SR buyers account every time i do a deposit.<br /><br />done this more than a few times now and had no problems<br /><br />*shrug*

				Still don&#039;t get the people that say &quot;I just go to CVS and do a deposit right to my SR wallet&quot; unless they&#039;re assuming that we&#039;re assuming that they&#039;re using Bitinstant, and choosing the &quot;Bitcoin to Email&quot; option. <br /><br />The Moneygram at Walmart, seems the least &quot;intrusive&quot; - I&#039;ve done both. - It seems like the only reason Moneygram wants your info, is to track orders, not for LE, but just because businesses make tons of money selling their customer list databases. <br /><br />To the one who says, it won&#039;t accept another name, it&#039;s because the BitInstant software, recognizes your email address. Just go get another email address. Get a Ymail at Yahoo, or Gmail, or @live.com from msn, I think. - I currently have about 3 all with pets names. - Even got an approved VISA card offer for my cat. - I shit you not!<br /><br />I think we&#039;re all reeling from the outtage, and the paranoia it caused. (BitInstant also changed their shit like a week before so can you blame me/us???)<br /><br />Also if you live in the Northeastern United States, you might just be realizing how bad Sandy was. I am from Long Island, and even I, with all my family down there, had no idea. <br /><br />Look on youtube for &quot;Sandys Aftermath&quot; - Pretty devastating. Especially Queens NY and lower Manhattan, where BitInstant is located, as well as many many servers used by the worlds most powerful ISP&#039;s. They got knocked out but good!<br /><br />SO!<br /><br />Let&#039;s all take a deep breath and get back on the road, before it floods out again !! <br /><br />Party on, and keep SR a secret !!! <br /><br />As much as I&#039;m tempted to tell people, I don&#039;t. I told only one good old friend who is very internet &quot;UN-savvy&quot;.&nbsp; It has been a nightmare!!!<br /><br />Betaraybob - what option were you choosing??? - Bitinstant with &quot;Bitcoin to email&quot; - Or &quot;Bitcoin to Mt Gox&quot; ???<br /><br />Peace <br /><br />- Jagfug
