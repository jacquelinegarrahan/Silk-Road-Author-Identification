				Online bandits made off with at least $228,000 worth of the virtual currency known as Bitcoin after exploiting a vulnerability in a widely used Webhost that gave unfettered access to eight victims&#039; digital wallets.<br /><br />Ars Technica was able to confirm the theft of 46,703 BTC, as individual units of Bitcoin are known, worth about $228,845 in US currency based on current exchange rates. More than 43,000 of the stolen BTC belonged to a Bitcoin trading platform known as Bitcoinica, the company&#039;s CEO and lead developer, Zhou Tong, told Ars. Another 3,094 BTC were lifted from the virtual purse of Marek Palatinus, a freelance programmer from the Czec Republic. He said in an interview that a separate Bitcoin user he&#039;s been in contact with lost 50 BTC to the same attackers. And Gavin Andersen, the lead Bitcoin programmer, told Ars he lost all 5 BTC he had stored in one online account.<br /><br />Hours after Palatinus and Andersen brought the attacks to light, cloud services provider Linode confirmed that a hacker targeted Bitcoin wallets stored on its servers after compromising a customer service portal.<br /><br />&quot;All activity by the intruder was limited to a total of eight customers, all of which had references to &#039;bitcoin,&#039;&quot; Linode&#039;s advisory stated. &quot;The intruder proceeded to compromise those Linode Manager accounts, with the apparent goal of finding and transferring any bitcoins. Those customers affected have been notified.&quot;<br /><br />Neither Linode Vice President Thomas Asaro nor members of Linode&#039;s press team responded to an email seeking comment for this article. The identities of the remaining four victims and the numbers of BTC they lost couldn&#039;t be determined at time of writing.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the first time there have been reports of Bitcoin thefts reaching into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In June, a veteran Bitcoin user reported a heist of the digital currency worth as much as $500,000, although the theft couldn&#039;t be independently verified. In the weeks that followed, several strains of malware were discovered that used the resources of compromised machines to &quot;mine&quot; bitcoins.<br />Convenience as the enemy to security<br /><br />Palatinus said he kept his $15,000 worth of BTC that was stolen in what&#039;s known as a &quot;hot wallet&quot; that was stored unencrypted on Linode&#039;s servers so it would be available for automatic payments.<br /><br />&quot;When somebody requests [a] significant amount of bitcoins for payout, I need [to] load them manually to wallet,&quot; he said during an online chat with Ars. &quot;Of course, low amount in wallet means lower comfort for users, because automatic payouts are sometimes unavailable. And higher amount means higher security risk.&quot;<br /><br />He said he stored considerably more BTC in encrypted format in USB drives that weren&#039;t connected to the Internet.<br /><br />Andersen said he&#039;s working on an update to the Bitcoin framework that would largely prevent thefts like those reported Thursday by requiring &quot;multisignature transactions.&quot; Under the new system, wallets would contain only one of two private encryption keys needed to spend coins. The other key would reside on a separate machine at a different location. Software on the second machine would scrutinize proposed transactions to make sure they&#039;re legitimate, and wouldn&#039;t send an entire payment all at once. The reworked system won&#039;t be in place for another few months.<br /><br />&quot;As I said in my blog post, [the theft] is very unfortunate because it is, in theory, preventable,&quot; Andersen told Ars. &quot;If I could go back in time a couple of years knowing then what I know now.... This kind of thing is the reason the bitcoin.org home page says that bitcoin is still &#039;experimental.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />An advisory issued by Bitcoinica admonished customers not to reuse old Bitcoin deposit addresses.<br /><br />&quot;As of now, our website will only display new deposit addresses which are not affected by this,&quot; it stated. &quot;However any old bitcoin addresses which you may have recorded for convenience should never be used ever again. This is the most important thing.&quot;<br /><br />The advisory said Bitcoinica lost more than 10,000 BTC in the heist, but Tong later told Ars the actual number was 43,554 coins.<br /><br />http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/bitcoins-worth-228000-stolen-from-customers-of-hacked-webhost.ars

				multi signature transfers are going to make mixing bitcoins very secure also. I think it is already part of the bitcoin protocol actually. Soon the mix and or escrow will not be able to steal your coins unless X% of the individually operated nodes are malicious and/or compromised. I envison a network of mixes that stores tons of bitcoins that you can pull money out of whenever you need it, without having to worry about the coins being stolen unless a large number of the mix operators decide to get together and fuck you (or are independently compromised). Open Transactions already allows for this :).

				Rely on someone else security is always risky. I will never keep my bitcoins in someone else wallet (online). Bitcoinica is offering good returns but there is no security in those places. They can take your bitcoins and disappear.<br /><br />228k stolen. Is that why bitcoins are trading for a lower value?

				I never really knew bitcoin really had this high value of usage if you know what I mean? Like I didn&#039;t know the world usage was this massive. 228k worth of bitcoins seems a lot.
