				Hey guys and girls, long time lurker, first time poster. Just wanted to be 110% sure I&#039;m doing this right before finally taking my first steps onto the road. <br /><br />I made a deposit direct to Intersango from my bank a couple of weeks ago and exchanged my GBP for BTC, which I know is perfectly legal, but far from anonymous. From Intersango, I transferred to several separate wallets, then onwards to instawallets, then to bitcoinfog, with the ultimate destination being SR. Is this going to be enough to keep me from being linked bank to my bank a/c and personal details or should I be adding any extra layers? <br /><br />Obviously buying the BTC anonymously in the first place would have been preferable, and I may well take that route in the future, but as there&#039;s currently no law against it, what would be the likelihood of my a/c or address being &#039;flagged&#039; for purchasing a crypto currency which, let&#039;s face it, a large proportion of which will end up being used for purchases here and other shady places.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your replies.<br />

				Thanks Pine, <br /><br />Looks like I done goofed then, I sent a small amount of BTC from my wallet -&gt; instawallet -&gt; bitcoinfog whilst connected to TOR, but as of yet haven&#039;t requested that they be sent on anywhere else from there. How bad news bears is that going to look? You think I should just send them back to my wallet, back to intersango, and cash out? Or write them off and put it down to experience, and start again truly anon? <br /><br />My naivety is probably horrendous here, but without LE having access to my computer, how would it be possible to prove that the wallet I sent BTC to from my intersango account was in any way connected to me?<br /><br />Thanks again.

				Hi abide,<br /><br />Welcome to SR!<br /><br />Naturally the Police would need access to Intersango&#039;s record to link the account transfer to your Bitcoin address but once they had done this they would be able to trace the movement of funds to/from that address. Any coins you buy using traceable methods can be tracked in this way unless you run them through what is known as a &quot;Mixer&quot; which will swap your coins around with those of other users, usually for a small fee.<br /><br />For future reference, if you want to be certain you&#039;ve bought your BTC anonymously I sell Bitcoins in exchange for cash in the mail for people in the UK (please see link below). <br /><br />As for the coins you have at the moment I suggest you run them through Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) which will increase your anonymity and chalk this one down to experience.<br /><br />Any other questions, please feel free to ask.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23351.msg243773#msg243773">Quote from: abide on May 16, 2012, 06:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thanks Pine, <br /><br />Looks like I done goofed then, I sent a small amount of BTC from my wallet -&gt; instawallet -&gt; bitcoinfog whilst connected to TOR, but as of yet haven&#039;t requested that they be sent on anywhere else from there.

				Good post pine.&nbsp; One question/issue : <br /><br />If I buy bitcoin from an exchange using bank deposit and access from another network + computer, then send those bitcoins directly to bitcoinfog (or maybe even instawallet --&gt; bitcoinfog) accessing these sites after I&#039;ve sent the coins on TOR, then how is that incriminating? <br />It&#039;s not illegal to buy or sell bitcoins, and it&#039;s certainly not illegal to send bitcoins to another user, which is what it looks like. How is anyone to know that the person I&#039;m sending bitcoins (well.. me) is intending to use them for illicit activity?

				..particularly if they bought them using cash! I&#039;m a shameless plug I know.<br /><br />No seriously, I think the CPS would step in and use the &quot;public interest&quot; veto they have on matters if some 65 year old Nun received a ton of hash in the post but as for the Bitcoins, it&#039;s not certain if a detailed analysis of the Blockchain would be enough evidence in court to pin on someone.<br /><br />I think certainly it could be used to put together an overall pattern of intelligence, which is why, quite unselfishly, I think it behoves users to obtain Bitcoins as discretely as possible. The problem is compounded by the fact that cashing out of Bitcoins is also not anonymous if handled incorrectly (let&#039;s not go into details here!)<br /><br />Having said that as you say proving that someone sent coins to a Bitcoin exchange in itself proves nothing - I used this method to send some money to a relative in Australia the other day as a way of avoiding extortionate Western Union fees for instance. However I think our goal should be perfect secrecy (even if this is unattainable), so suggest we seize with both hands any opportunities to cover our tracks!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23351.msg243820#msg243820">Quote from: gustono on May 16, 2012, 06:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23351.msg243809#msg243809">Quote from: vlad1m1r on May 16, 2012, 06:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Actually Gustono, I&#039;m afraid you can get into trouble for receiving drugs in the mail in the UK where we live.<br /><br />I went into this in some detail in another thread (Please see: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9543.msg189546#msg189546) but essentially it boils down to Possession itself being the offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act - taking ownership of a package is generally accepted to entail taking ownership of its contents therefore if you accept contraband into your home or sign for them at a postal depot, you can be arrested.<br /><br />If you try to plead ignorance i.e innocent possession this is a defence but it is what is known as a rebuttable presumption i.e the onus will be upon you to demonstrate you were ignorant as to the contents of the package.

				Agreed, FYI Vlad if you dropped your commission fees down to 7-8% I would use your service, not trying to sound rude or offend you with your current fees as they are probably like that for a good reason, jus sayin.<br /><br />And to OP, leaving it in a bitcoinfog tumbler for 4 days will be sufficient to cover your tracks, take it as a loss and move on.<br /><br />The new protocol seems to be : <br /><br />Deposit cash in to MtGox --&gt; Access clearnet through proxy/computer + network not related to you (former preferred) --&gt; bitcoinfog/instawallet (former preferred) --&gt; SR.

				Using your bank account to buy some bitcoins from intersango is NOT a worry.<br /><br />Not unless you maybe buy like 10,000 BTC - or even 2000 BTC as Intersango or any financial institution has to report on anyone who goes beyond £5000 in transactions.<br /><br />BTC is NOT illegal but it will be being watched as the police know there will be a few silly dealers who cash out from intersango to their own bank account.<br /><br />but if your just spending a few hundred BTC a year - I&#039;d not worry. You could be investing in BTC or actually be into BTC gambling or porn or all the legal services we have on evenSR.<br /><br />SR is just one of MANY sites that take BTC.<br /><br />If I was trading BTC I would take cash payments but be very careful as all it needs is for the cops to send some cash and you may be a target for a money launderer. Just make sure you make yourself and your cash distance buddies!<br /><br />Intersango WILL be watched by the cops. Odds are if they see BIG deals being done - and people cashing out thousands of BTC per month then you ought to expect a knock or actually more like a &#039;CRASH&#039; as the door flies in and men in masks shout &#039;don&#039;t move we are the police&#039;.<br /><br />As someone who maybe spends 75-100 BTC per week - I can either go to a bank and pay in anon but now intersango use some small bank with no brnches anywhere. Paying into TSB still works but takes longer than paying via your bank to their new bank account.<br /><br />Like I say BTC is spent on lots of things. Maybe you hire an escort each month and get a good old thrashing. Its your right! Actually I will give you a good whipping for 15 BTC! And if your name is Tony and your from Canda I&#039;ll actually use a food mixer - which gets quite messy and to be honest its a trip to hospital sex actually. Doctors will have WTF looks on their faces. Its rare for a man to have a whipped cream blender stuck up his ass. But for Tony I&#039;d do that. My &#039;feel the love&#039; sale would cost him nothing. <br /><br />So - hey, don&#039;t worry about buying BTC. Bertter still set up a website selling ordinary legal things with BTC as the coinage. <br /><br />I plan to do this.<br /><br />Also plan to so stuff here under another name!<br /><br />But I am learning this Linux secure configuration stuff - virtual box operating systems and USB sticks with secure linux on.<br /><br />People sell that stuff here. That can save the lives of &#039;dissidents&#039; whose dissidence might be to be gay in some nation which would kill anyone who stood up and said they were gay. It can give a voice to people who would surely die if they spoke out in public.<br /><br />The worse people can cry about on here is that some vendors sell heroin!<br /><br />You can go to any pub in the UK and find someone who knows someone who can ring up someone delivering &#039;heroin&#039; in ten mins. In my city heroin is sold 27/7. The &#039;team&#039; consists of someone in a house/flat minding the gear and cutting it, A driver and someone who will happily use over the top violence. The heroin users, many who use heroin as an anti depressant in my view, are treated like dirt by the &#039;vendors&#039;. They are bullied, ripped off more often thn not and sold a &#039;heroin&#039; which is sold here would last about a week before we saw everyone state it was shit.<br /><br />So morally speaking I don&#039;t care if some site I use for legal things has some illegal things going on. Its like life itself.<br /><br />Anyhow - the more of spending bitcoins openly the better. I would reccomened everyone who has some hobby that creates something to run a onion website and charge BTC for your wares. I would love to spend BTC on many of the things people out there have in the attic and lofts. <br /><br />Maybe a BTC site to be as Ebay ought to have been. <br /><br />So lets do that!<br /><br />And less worrying about buying BTC fron bank accounts! As long as you do not go wild then its ok. but truth be told - I do not know why some here do not do not sell BTC by ingenious methods that cannot be traced. You offer one item on some low percentage taking popular website - set&nbsp; certain conditions to make sure people order what they need. For example plastic soldiers, someone orders 40, you know they want 40 BTC. <br /><br />Sending cash by post is not 100% safe and it would be easier for a BTC trader to come up with an idea that just allowed instant purchases that released those instant BTC to you.<br /><br />Intersango is getting better and I now usually order and get the BTC in an instant. From there I do not mess with my own wallet and just send it to a different SR wallet every-time. Here the BTC is put through a process whereby nobody knows what I bought. Could have been an escort service with some Russian or could have been me buying a seciond hand laptop off some guy from France or any one of the hundreds of legal products on sale here on SR.<br /><br />So don&#039;t worry so much.<br /><br />In the UK we could test the entire population for drugs and 20% of us would have something in there. <br /><br />The cops who will be given the task of trying to stop SR will be tech savvy but they will know that they need to catch some serious movement of drugs to justify the cost. Unlike real life - its not worth anything catching a buyer.&nbsp; buyer here cannot be set up as a snitch - because none of us know each other. All we have is an envelope. And guess what? SR did not invent posting drugs through the post. Its been going on ever since the post was invented! I recall sending hash from my town in the 80s to places were it was twice as expensive. Never made cash. Done friends the favor. but back then it was just wrap in a load of clingfilm and hope for the best. It all got through but we had no sniffer dogs and less posties who can smell skunk at ten yards through an envelope.<br /><br />Main danger with BTC is buying too many which makes you look like a dealer. Even then - the dealers here for the most part do not know each other. If one was caught they would not wiser than the average buyer.<br /><br />I suspects cops have set fake accounts up to harvest addresses. They could in theory narrow down postal areas packages are sent from. But in many major cities there are thousands of postboxes!&nbsp; I guess dealers selling BIG amounts.<br /><br />In my eyes, users here just buying a few grams of whatever ought not to worry. Spending maybe 100 BTC per month is not a worry. Dealers deal in thousands. If you use bank accounts to tranfer funds to intersango and buy up a shit load of BTC the authorities have been notified.<br /><br />If you sell BTC - best be self employed. At worse in the UK its going to be seen as work and if your unemployed then its cheating! Be careful.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />I&#039;m just off to transfer a few pounds to Intersango tomorrow to boost up my account to buy the shopping basket of legal things I have. Got a pair of Suzi Quatros used knickers for 36.8 BTC. Guy reckons they been in a sealed bag since the 70s. My therapist says this stuff is some &#039;fucked up shit from my childhood&#039; I was circumcised at the time Suzi was top of the pops.<br /><br />I&#039;m only half Jewish though - Jewish dad and mum was a Christin but Grandmother a Jew. They reckon my grandad was the only survivor on some bad ship torpedo incident. More than likely he got pissed or got at the morphine and done a classic act of FUBAR. He lived off that survival story and introduced harks into it in later years. He ate an injured albatross and uses bits of clothes for&nbsp; fishing line. He must have drank 10,000 pints on that story but good luck to him. Poor sould died actual in a conjugal act. Felt sorry for the poor dear he was with. Imagine he just dies on top of you. For a while you let him rest - its nice to chill after the act of love making. but then you discover your having sex with a dead man. Well, he died happy. <br /><br />Anyhow fear not. The more of us spend BTC the better. Sell something you got here for BTC. Teddy bears. Anything really. I&#039;ll sell my collections of porn magazines from the 70s and 80s - I&#039;ll let them got for the class price of 10 BTC (the mags are NOT stained!!) postage will be 4500 BTC lol. And if you could recommend a good physiotherapist who specializes in wrist movement - I&#039;d shale you hand well - lets just nod in agreement then.<br /><br />I don&#039;t suppose any chance of some kosha deals from any fellow Jews here? Then again that would be bad as we could all do better deals for our social group of birth. I don&#039;t do any religious stuff. <br /><br /><br /><br />

(because if it&#039;s the first then the exchange already has your IP address anyway) I assume you&#039;re talking about walking physically to something like an internet cafe.<br /><br />If it&#039;s the latter, then you should be ok but you will still potentially throw some red flags through use of Tor when accessing the exchange.<br /><br />You see, ideally you are using a proxy within the same country that the bank deposit was made at. It&#039;s a bit weird to be depositing money in Florida and then 10 minutes later the exchange account is accessed in Belize. So I assume that would throw a red flag unless you rip your shirt and bare your chest in the bank to demonstrate the superman logo (faster than a speeding bullet!).<br /><br />This implies that you wouldn&#039;t actually be using Tor on the other network&#039;s computer. Naturally I&#039;m slightly uncomfortable with that idea because of CCTV and other caveats like what if your computer requires a login, fingerprints etc. Possibly you should be using thin layered gloves, dark glasses and a hat. Just sunglasses and liquid band-aid works too so long as you don&#039;t have criminal record.<br /><br />So; you still ought to access a private proxy in your region and access that via the Tor network for maximum security (at this other network instead of home computer).<br /><br />However, so long as you take care of the caveats like CCTV et al as I described, there&#039;s nothing wrong with your idea of using another network&#039;s computer, all of this really is a function of just how paranoid you are and how paranoid you should be (i.e. how much you&#039;re buying). I mean, if we&#039;re talking about 20 BTC, then my instructions in this post are overkill. But if it&#039;s 20,000 BTC then I&#039;ll call you an idiot for not following them, I think you understand what I mean. ;-)

				Sorry if I have missed something but what is the issue with accessing Instawallet via Tor?<br />I would have thought that sending money to Instawallet (having accessed it from Tor to get the address) and then sending it on from there via Tor would provide better privacy.

However I would prefer it if the exchange did not know your identity in the first place. Don&#039;t send the bitcoins you have now (either at bitcoinfog or at the wallets) back to the exchange because you&#039;ll have created a loop (they&#039;ll be able to infer you used bitcoinfog and the wallets, whereas now there is no direct evidence for that).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So, would be sending bitcoins from intersango --&gt; bitcoinfog be unsatisfactory?

				Thanks vlad.

(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50013.0) - also you need to be able to keep a copy of the Instwallet URL in order to retrieve your coins so make sure you add it to your book marks if you use the Tor Browser - you won&#039;t be able to browse through your history to recover the link if you fail to do this.<br /><br />b) Firstly a little 101 c/o the Bitcoin Fog website on how their mixer works:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A link could be made if you would get paid from the same address that you have deposited bitcoins to. This is not the case with Bitcoin Fog. The money you deposit actually stay on the random initial address we generate for you. Only when our main account is running low, do we transfer the money from your deposit address to the main pool. That way, you may get a payout from the pool, while your original money is still sitting on the random initial account, not linked to your payout anywhere in the block chain. Since it is just a bitcoin address like any other, there is no way to even see that you have deposited money to Bitcoin Fog, and not to a random account you have generated yourself. (Until the pool runs low and transfers your original money.)<br /><br />Even if you waited long enough time for your money to be transferred to the pool, there is still no reliable way to see that it was your original transfer that is the source of your payout, since it is mixed with other users&#039; transfers.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is the amount of your withdrawal. If you transfer 1.382 to us, and the next day you withdraw ~1.38 bitcoins to another account, those amounts will be visible in the block chain, and unless there were 10 other people that day that also withdrew just 1.38 bitcoins, the link between your deposit and your withdrawal will be pretty obvious. You will still have plausible deniability, since nobody else has access to our servers and can actually prove that those bitcoins came from your account, but the link will be found nevertheless.<br /><br />This is why you should ideally never withdraw the same amount as you have deposited. We are already helping you to do this by transferring your money to you in multiple randomized payouts at randomized times (and optionally to different addresses), but to be sure you should withdraw to multiple addresses and different amounts than the one you have deposited. Also make sure to change your deposit address every now and then to further anonymize your payments.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So in short there&#039;s no way to tell through analysis of the block chain alone that the address to which you&#039;ve sent your coins was BitcoinFog&#039;s or one you made up (yes this is possible! more on that later). <br /><br />It is also possible to send Bitcoins through Bitcoinfog or another mixing service a number of times or (as I recommend) withdrawing random amounts to multiple wallets over a longer period of time, all of which will make it much more difficult to trace the flow of your funds.<br /><br />Having said this, transferring a similar amount to your original deposit into a single wallet later on and then extracting it from the Block chain e.g by withdrawal to your bank account could mean that it&#039;s possible to surmise the coins are yours (insofar as coins can be said to be &quot;yours&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;).<br /><br />As I explained in the example above, breaking the chain of causation in itself doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it will be impossible to suggest you&#039;ve done something illicit - in the case of someone who has received a package in the mail and is trying to plead ignorance, the proof that you purchased Bitcoins in itself may well be enough to sway a jury who might otherwise have given you the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />So the short answer is that while using a mixing service properly may stop someone from proving a direct transfer of funds from you to someone else via the Bitcoin block chain, the real risk lies in proving you bought said Bitcoins in the first place. As such I&#039;d recommend using cash or selling digital goods / products in exchange for Bitcoins - I am not just saying this to profit from your custom as I think you&#039;re in the US(?) - it&#039;s just a matter of leaving no loose ends.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				I went into this in some detail in another thread (Please see: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9543.msg189546#msg189546) but essentially it boils down to Possession itself being the offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act - taking ownership of a package is generally accepted to entail taking ownership of its contents therefore if you accept contraband into your home or sign for them at a postal depot, you can be arrested.<br /><br />If you try to plead ignorance i.e innocent possession this is a defence but it is what is known as a rebuttable presumption i.e the onus will be upon you to demonstrate you were ignorant as to the contents of the package.
