				For some strange reason, I still had access to the forum while it was &quot;down&quot; for the rest you. Maybe it&#039;s because circuit handling works differently in Whonix than in TBB, but it got down to three people on the forum. onion.to and onion.sh are both down now (I checked), so I&#039;m not sure how the others accessed the forum, but it was just the three of us. I got bored from the lack of new posts, so I started reading some of the earliest posts on the forum, looking at the first people who registered, etc. I looked at kmf&#039;s first post and it was amazingly prescient in light of the FH exploit.<br /><br />Take a look:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7998.msg72828#msg72828<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7998.msg72828#msg72828">Quote from: kmfkewm on January 02, 2012, 09:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Of course you should isolate firefox and other network facing applications using virtualization technology. You can even isolate Tor to a VM that runs a secure OS. Anyone who says this is counter productive to anonymity has no idea what the fuck they are talking about. Don&#039;t be confused by police PSYOP agents and the countless people who speak their (incorrect) opinions as if they are certainly factual. It really boils down to this:<br /><br />If you do not isolate network facing applications, if they have critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (they do, although none may be publicly known at any given time), an attacker can take over the permissions of the application. After doing this, the attacker can deanonymize you without breaking Tor by by passing it on the application layer, for example instructing firefox to send data around Tor to a malicious server. This is only one of many ways the attacker could get your IP address after identifying a vulnerability in one of your network facing applications. <br /><br />If you do isolate your network facing applications using virtualization software, even if an attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of them and roots your VM, they will not be able to get your external IP address. The VM itself is unaware of your external IP address, only knowing an internal IP address assigned to it. Now the attacker needs to find an additional vulnerability in Tor, or a vulnerability that allows them to break out of the virtualization solution, before they can get your external IP address with a proxy by pass attack. It is worth noting that if an attacker roots your VM they will be able to reduce the anonymity Tor provides you from traffic analysis attacks to roughly the same as Tor provides to hidden services, which is substantially less than Tor provides to non-hidden service clients. This is because an attacker can force a hidden service to open an arbitrary number of new circuits, but can not force a normal client to open an arbitrary number of new circuits. However, if the attacker has rooted the VM of a network facing application that routes its traffic through Tor, they can force Tor to open an arbitrary number of circuits.<br /><br />Follow the tutorial linked above that OVDB admin made, but do not use polipo. Polipo is insecure and has anonymity degrading bugs in it, and should not be used. Modern versions of firefox allow for socks proxy routing without the need for an additional http proxy, you probably need to allow proxified DNS in your about:config though. Nobody should be using polipo anymore. But do follow the linked tutorial just skip the polipo portions. <br /><br />OpenBSD provides a wide range of automatic security features which further increases your security from application layer exploits. For example, if you have a 64 bit CPU and or CPU with nx bit capabilities , OpenBSD will prevent an attacker from exploiting entire classes of potential vulnerabilities that may be (read: are) present in your network facing applications.<br /><br />You may also be interested in reading about mandatory access control systems, like the previously mentioned virtualization technique mandatory access controls&nbsp; offer security via isolation. However, it is harder to use mandatory access control systems to isolate applications from Tor / external IP address. <br /><br />Law enforcement are going to start doing all of their wiretap and tracing operations on the application layer, because they can&#039;t break GPG or reliably break Tor (although they probably can break it for small random selections of users, they can&#039;t break it for a given selected target in the majority of cases), but they can exploit one of the endless streams of vulnerabilities in applications like Firefox. They are starting to work with corporations that sell them prepackaged exploit kits for such attacks.<br /><br />It is worth noting that law enforcement will have a much easier time to trace SR users with such attacks after they have taken over the SR server, although it is not impossible for them to &#039;leap frog&#039; the server (for one example, GPG has had remote code execution vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to launch arbitrary code merely by having the target decrypt exploit ciphertexts...such a ciphertext could be sent through a secure non-compromised SR server). <br /><br />It is also worth noting that the NSA stockpiles as mny remote code execution vulnerability intelligence / exploits as possible, and can trace through Tor on the application layer / steal plaintexts / keys on the application layer, with ease.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Jeesh why take all these security threads off topic. I made a fucking post in off topic for this issue why not keep it there instead of derail every single thread with your rants about how wrong viewing CP is. Nobody gives a fuck what you think, and you guys go to every thread you can to let people in it know that pedophiles must be killed, all sex with anyone under 18 is bad, CP viewing is the same as raping little kids, etc. I made a special thread to run logical circles around you guys in, stop taking all these other ones off topic already.

				Did I mention what kind of scumbag a drug dealer is? <br /><br />It is a criminal who, instead of having a legal job at&nbsp; McDonalds and earning what ordinary people earn, chooses to sell illegal drugs. A drug dealer&nbsp; is a lazy and corrupt abuser who gets money by selling wildly overpriced garbage. <br /><br />Drug dealers are nothing but an arm of the state. Drug dealers exist only because of prohibition. And yet they pretend to have the moral high ground? What a&nbsp; fucking joke. <br /><br />

Around age 31, fertility starts to drop more quickly — by about 3 percent per year — until you hit 35 or so.&quot;<br /><br />Okay, so you were wrong about fertility.&nbsp; No biggie.&nbsp; Your argument was about SEXUALITY and sexual prime; so I&#039;m glad we&#039;re finally back on your chosen topic.&nbsp; We&#039;re going to start with those hormones you say are the biological root of sexuality:<br /><br />&quot;In men, testosterone levels reach their apex around age 18, while women’s estrogen (and fertility) hits a high-water mark during the mid- to late-20s. This hot-and-heavy stage of sexual maturity is known as the genital prime, because it’s when the body responds most quickly to arousal.&quot;<br /><br />But Actually ...<br /><br />According to Dr. Marc Goldstein of Cornell University, hormones don&#039;t decide when you hit your sexual apex. People aren&#039;t soda bottles that just reach a point of maximum pressure and then pop. Your &quot;sexual peak&quot; has more to do with your attitude toward sex and level of experience, which is one reason millions of awkward young men spend their entire sexual prime on a computer(this means you KMF).<br /><br />Oh, and it has nothing to do with psychology?&nbsp; That&#039;s profoundly stupid and narrow thinking on your part.<br /><br />&quot;With pharmaceutical companies in hot pursuit of a pill that could do for women&#039;s sexual fulfillment what Viagra has done for men&#039;s, experts are busy investigating what&#039;s responsible for female passion.<br />Researchers are finding that the sex experts Masters and Johnson were wrong when they claimed that female and male desire were alike. New studies suggest that women need to be aroused physically or psychologically to get in the mood for sex. Unlike men, who can get aroused by the sight of a buxom babe in a beer commercial, women rely on different--and subtler--cues.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content<br /><br />Early Sex. Research has long established that teens who watch movies or listen to music that glamorizes drinking, drug use or violence tend to engage in those behaviors themselves. A 2012 study shows that movies influence teens’ sexual attitudes and behaviors as well. The study, published in Psychological Science, found that the more teens were exposed to sexual content in movies, the earlier they started having sex and the likelier they were to have casual, unprotected sex.<br /><br />In another study, boys who were exposed to sexually explicit media were three times more likely to engage in oral sex and intercourse two years after exposure than non-exposed boys. Young girls exposed to sexual content in the media were twice as likely to engage in oral sex and one and a half times more likely to have intercourse. Research also shows that teens who listened to music with degrading sexual references were more likely to have sex than those who had less exposure.<br /><br />Why are teens more likely to have sex after being exposed to sexual content in the media? Just as we read specific books and show educational movies to our children in hopes that they learn lessons from the characters, the media provides a type of sex education to young people. Media messages normalize early sexual experimentation and portray sex as casual, unprotected and consequence-free, encouraging sexual activity long before children are emotionally, socially or intellectually ready.<br /><br />High-Risk Sex. The earlier a child is exposed to sexual content and begins having sex, the likelier they are to engage in high-risk sex. Research shows that children who have sex by age 13 are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, engage in frequent intercourse, have unprotected sex and use drugs or alcohol before sex. In a study by researcher Dr. Jennings Bryant, more than 66 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls reported wanting to try some of the sexual behaviors they saw in the media (and by high school, many had done so), which increases the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.<br /><br />Sex, Love and Relationship Addictions. Not every child who is exposed to sexual content will struggle with a mental health disorder, but research shows that early exposure to pornography is a risk factor for sex addictions and other intimacy disorders. In one study of 932 sex addicts, 90 percent of men and 77 percent of women reported that pornography was a factor in their addiction. With the widespread availability of explicit material on the Internet, these problems are becoming more prevalent and are surfacing at younger ages.<br /><br />Sexual Violence. According to some studies, early exposure (by age 14) to pornography and other explicit material may increase the risk of a child becoming a victim of sexual violence or acting out sexually against another child. For some people, habitual use of pornography may prompt a desire for more violent or deviant material, including depictions of rape, torture or humiliation. If people seek to act out what they see, they may be more likely to commit sexual assault, rape or child molestation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you not had an epic enough fail on your topic?&nbsp; This will be my last post on the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good luck explaining away the experts with your vast knowledge of the sexuality of a 14 year old girl.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry, a 14.5 year old girl.&nbsp; Or boy.<br /><br />

Acuminata means long-pointed or tapering, not referring to the fruit, but to the flowers giving birth to the fruit.<br /><br />Antonius Musa was the personal physician to Roman emperor Octavius Augustus, and it was he who was credited for promoting cultivation of the exotic African fruit from 63 to 14 B.C. <br /><br />Portugese sailors brought bananas to Europe from West Africa in the early fifteenth century. Its Guinean name banema, which became banana in English, was first found in print in the seventeenth century.<br /><br />The original banana has been cultivated and used since ancient times, even pre-dating the cultivation of rice. While the banana thrived in Africa, its origins are said to be of East Asia and Oceania.<br /><br />The banana was carried by sailors to the Canary Islands and the West Indies, finally making it to North America with Spanish missionary Friar Tomas de Berlanga.<br />Sweet bananas are mutants<br />These historical bananas were not the sweet yellow banana we know today, but the red and green cooking variety, now usually referred to as plantains to distinguish them from the sweet type.<br /><br />The yellow sweet banana is a mutant strain of the cooking banana, discovered in 1836 by Jamaican Jean Francois Poujot, who found one of the banana trees on his plantation was bearing yellow fruit rather than green or red. Upon tasting the new discovery, he found it to be sweet in its raw state, without the need for cooking. He quickly began cultivating this sweet variety.<br /><br />Soon they were being imported from the Caribbean to New Orleans, Boston, and New York, and were considered such an exotic treat, they were eaten on a plate using a knife and fork. Sweet bananas were all the rage at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, selling for a hefty ten cents each. <br /><br /><br />OH YEAH WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY NOW I EPIC PWNED YOU<br />&quot;<br /><br />me - &quot;LOL&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot;Wow dude you sure are manic shizoid dysphoric pedophile!&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot;Almost ALL apples are poison&quot;<br /><br />me - &quot;LOL&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot; I WINZ TEH INTERNET&quot;

				It is funny because I have been right all along on this issue as well, and hopefully in the future society will be ready to accept that people should be free so long as they do not directly harm others, and hopefully people will grow out of their magical thinking. I deleted the locked CP thread in off topic, I don&#039;t think DPR will care about it at all and would let it be unlocked, but it is pointless to argue with people who think with their emotions. It is clearly censorship to tell people what they can or cannot look at , and it is absolutely horrible that people have their lives ruined for looking at pictures, but there are just too many stupid emotional people so we will just need to let time pass and wait for a brighter future (that I will probably never live to see) where people will be judged by the actions they take against others rather than the feelings they have or the pictures they decide to look at. <br /><br />Time changes more things than you realize when you are stuck inside of your society and culture of an era, just a little over 100 years ago people took 12 year old wives regularly, prior to that black people were traded like livestock and if you asked a person then will this change in 200 years they would laugh and say no black people are animals and not humans and that will never change, and the thought that a black person could be treated as a human is preposterous. Today you say people will never be allowed to look at child porn without being sent to be tortured and raped in prison, and you say they are filthy vile child rapists, but in time people will look back and see your over reaction and your jumping to conclusions and they will be shocked at the barbaric way you treated people for looking at pictures without actually harming anybody. So have fun being smug in the present with the others supporting you, because in the future you will be seen as barbarians.

I mean, if you actually had an argument with a real delusional pedophile, you would really think that nothing I have said sounds like anything a delusional pedophile would say. If you note, all of my arguments have been either based on research and statistics, or philosophy of freedom of information, or philosophy of leaving people the fuck alone unless they cause real harm to others, whereas real pedophiles arguments tend to be that having sex with kids is good for them and that 5 year olds love sucking cock.

Acuminata means long-pointed or tapering, not referring to the fruit, but to the flowers giving birth to the fruit.<br /><br />Antonius Musa was the personal physician to Roman emperor Octavius Augustus, and it was he who was credited for promoting cultivation of the exotic African fruit from 63 to 14 B.C. <br /><br />Portugese sailors brought bananas to Europe from West Africa in the early fifteenth century. Its Guinean name banema, which became banana in English, was first found in print in the seventeenth century.<br /><br />The original banana has been cultivated and used since ancient times, even pre-dating the cultivation of rice. While the banana thrived in Africa, its origins are said to be of East Asia and Oceania.<br /><br />The banana was carried by sailors to the Canary Islands and the West Indies, finally making it to North America with Spanish missionary Friar Tomas de Berlanga.<br />Sweet bananas are mutants<br />These historical bananas were not the sweet yellow banana we know today, but the red and green cooking variety, now usually referred to as plantains to distinguish them from the sweet type.<br /><br />The yellow sweet banana is a mutant strain of the cooking banana, discovered in 1836 by Jamaican Jean Francois Poujot, who found one of the banana trees on his plantation was bearing yellow fruit rather than green or red. Upon tasting the new discovery, he found it to be sweet in its raw state, without the need for cooking. He quickly began cultivating this sweet variety.<br /><br />Soon they were being imported from the Caribbean to New Orleans, Boston, and New York, and were considered such an exotic treat, they were eaten on a plate using a knife and fork. Sweet bananas were all the rage at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, selling for a hefty ten cents each. <br /><br /><br />OH YEAH WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY NOW I EPIC PWNED YOU<br />&quot;<br /><br />me - &quot;LOL&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot;Wow dude you sure are manic shizoid dysphoric pedophile!&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot;Almost ALL apples are poison&quot;<br /><br />me - &quot;LOL&quot;<br /><br />Praetorian - &quot; I WINZ TEH INTERNET&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually, it was Bruce Campbell who said you were a schizophrenic, and dysphoric.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t remember calling you a pedophile once.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall ever even using the word through your entire fail of a thread that got locked.&nbsp; Of course, you&#039;re more than welcome to comb through and provide actual quotes of me saying these things, and not just random teen-mentality level attempts at insulting my intelligence by quoting things no one ever said once.<br /><br />I will admit calling you manic, which has been reiterated in profoundly stupid outcries such as the very post I am quoting and responding to this very second. <br /><br />I definitely called you an idiot, because you lack tact and you&#039;re not educated enough on the topic you were &#039;trying&#039; to talk about.&nbsp; Censorship.&nbsp; You were trying to justify some self-proclaimed validity in using Child Pornography as the catalyst for your argument; stating that it should not be illegal to &#039;simply view&#039; it, because you &#039;are not causing that person any harm yourself.&#039;&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, you cited valid sources; namely Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_child_pornography_and_child_sexual_abuse#Views_on_the_relation_between_child_pornography_law_and_sexualization_of_children&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;--in which everything you posted in your other thread and this one could have easily been copied and pasted from.<br /><br />Regardless; the argument is over.&nbsp; Mods said they let it go for 11 pages waiting for you to get to some kind of point; but that point never came.&nbsp; Using CP in wake of all the drama surrounding it, as an example of censorship is complete bullshit.&nbsp; Any number of things could be used to form a better argument; achieving perhaps the very personal freedoms you&#039;re arguing on behalf of.&nbsp; But, you&#039;re not thinking about this 4th-dimentially Marty... you&#039;re attracting all the wrong attention.<br /><br />Anyway, hopefully you take my advice and stop wearing your ass as a hat one of these days...

It continues to emerge in research that the groups that abuse children are very distinct from the groups that view child pornography, they have minimal overlap. This will become more and more common knowledge as time passes.

There is essentially no remaining financial market for child pornography, and nobody is going to run out and molest children just because people want to see pictures of it. Furthermore, there are technical solutions that would allow people to view child pornography without any demand being identifiable, and yet when I bring these solutions up none of the crusaders think they change anything, which shows pretty plainly that the crusaders are actually not arguing that child porn viewing should be illegal because of demand, even though they ostensibly are. I already have given citations to Ph.D researchers who claim that there has been no empirical evidence inherently linking child pornography consumption to the production of child pornography. Furthermore, if there is demand for photographs of you cutting your dick off and jamming it up your asshole, are you going to fill the demand? I guess demand is not inherently linked to supply after all.

				I was really hoping this would be a thread about the importance of VM isolation...<br /><br />kmf, I&#039;ve told you before you need to learn how to pick your battles. A lot of people could improve their security from VM isolation, but it&#039;s easy for them to hand wave away this advice when you obsessively argue about CP everywhere.<br /><br />Luckily, I have the power this time.<br /><br />GET THIS SHIT OUT OF SECURITY.<br /><br /><br />Edit: And fuck you Jack for starting this here.<br />
