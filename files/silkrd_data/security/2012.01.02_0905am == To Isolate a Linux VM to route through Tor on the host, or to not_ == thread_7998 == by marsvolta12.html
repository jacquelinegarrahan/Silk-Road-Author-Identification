				Of course you should isolate firefox and other network facing applications using virtualization technology. You can even isolate Tor to a VM that runs a secure OS. Anyone who says this is counter productive to anonymity has no idea what the fuck they are talking about. Don&#039;t be confused by police PSYOP agents and the countless people who speak their (incorrect) opinions as if they are certainly factual. It really boils down to this:<br /><br />If you do not isolate network facing applications, if they have critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (they do, although none may be publicly known at any given time), an attacker can take over the permissions of the application. After doing this, the attacker can deanonymize you without breaking Tor by by passing it on the application layer, for example instructing firefox to send data around Tor to a malicious server. This is only one of many ways the attacker could get your IP address after identifying a vulnerability in one of your network facing applications. <br /><br />If you do isolate your network facing applications using virtualization software, even if an attacker exploits a vulnerability in one of them and roots your VM, they will not be able to get your external IP address. The VM itself is unaware of your external IP address, only knowing an internal IP address assigned to it. Now the attacker needs to find an additional vulnerability in Tor, or a vulnerability that allows them to break out of the virtualization solution, before they can get your external IP address with a proxy by pass attack. It is worth noting that if an attacker roots your VM they will be able to reduce the anonymity Tor provides you from traffic analysis attacks to roughly the same as Tor provides to hidden services, which is substantially less than Tor provides to non-hidden service clients. This is because an attacker can force a hidden service to open an arbitrary number of new circuits, but can not force a normal client to open an arbitrary number of new circuits. However, if the attacker has rooted the VM of a network facing application that routes its traffic through Tor, they can force Tor to open an arbitrary number of circuits.<br /><br />Follow the tutorial linked above that OVDB admin made, but do not use polipo. Polipo is insecure and has anonymity degrading bugs in it, and should not be used. Modern versions of firefox allow for socks proxy routing without the need for an additional http proxy, you probably need to allow proxified DNS in your about:config though. Nobody should be using polipo anymore. But do follow the linked tutorial just skip the polipo portions. <br /><br />OpenBSD provides a wide range of automatic security features which further increases your security from application layer exploits. For example, if you have a 64 bit CPU and or CPU with nx bit capabilities , OpenBSD will prevent an attacker from exploiting entire classes of potential vulnerabilities that may be (read: are) present in your network facing applications.<br /><br />You may also be interested in reading about mandatory access control systems, like the previously mentioned virtualization technique mandatory access controls&nbsp; offer security via isolation. However, it is harder to use mandatory access control systems to isolate applications from Tor / external IP address. <br /><br />Law enforcement are going to start doing all of their wiretap and tracing operations on the application layer, because they can&#039;t break GPG or reliably break Tor (although they probably can break it for small random selections of users, they can&#039;t break it for a given selected target in the majority of cases), but they can exploit one of the endless streams of vulnerabilities in applications like Firefox. They are starting to work with corporations that sell them prepackaged exploit kits for such attacks.<br /><br />It is worth noting that law enforcement will have a much easier time to trace SR users with such attacks after they have taken over the SR server, although it is not impossible for them to &#039;leap frog&#039; the server (for one example, GPG has had remote code execution vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to launch arbitrary code merely by having the target decrypt exploit ciphertexts...such a ciphertext could be sent through a secure non-compromised SR server). <br /><br />It is also worth noting that the NSA stockpiles as mny remote code execution vulnerability intelligence / exploits as possible, and can trace through Tor on the application layer / steal plaintexts / keys on the application layer, with ease.

If you isolate firefox from Tor with virtualization, even if the firefox VM is rooted the attacker can not determine your external IP address. Instead they will only be able to determine the internal IP address assigned to the VM, something like 10.0.0.1. The only way an attacker can go from being root of the VM to getting the external IP address is if they find a vulnerability in the virtualbox hypervisor and break out of it or if they find a vulnerability in the code of Tor or anything else that is bound to the virtual network adapter.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Tor bundle includes aurora (firefox) = &quot;the client&quot;, is configured for Tor and probably wouldnt easily be able to determine this&nbsp; external ip bound to the physical router.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Tor browser bundle&nbsp; provides zero isolation and if aurora is pwnt the attacker can trivially get IP address. Tor browser bundle includes a security hardened browser that should be used, but it isn&#039;t isolated. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- its the OS that is being virtualised, &quot;virtualised apps&quot; is like citrix xen or Novell ZenWorks or where you are running a virtual desktop, a virtual desktop means the<br />&nbsp; &quot;virtual&quot; instance is running elsewhere and your screen just displays the screen refreshes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No shit it is the OS being virtualized with virtualbox? I had no idea. Guess what operating systems contain within them. Applications! Some of them need to communicate with the internet to, and those are network facing applications! I am well aware of the different types of virtualization, but right now I am talking about full hardware virtualization systems like virtualbox with host only routing (although there are other networking methods that can get the same result).<br /><br />Yeah I know about networking too we are so leet<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the ability of the guest OS working out its external ipaddress or public ipaddress depends on the client and whether it has been forced to use a proxy/socks or not</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why do you talk in an authorative fashin, like I am wrong, when I know what I am talking about and it is you who is failing to understand the technique? The ability of the guest OS to determine your external broadcast IP address has nothing to do with the browser or tor client or proxy settings , and this is a technique that forces every application to use tor or have no internet access also, in addition to making it so if the vm is rooted the attacker can not use their root position to immediately deanonymize you on the application layer

				In an ideal world you would be using multiple layers of isolation as well. Virtualbox being used in this way is merely one layer of isolation. Mandatory access controls are another sort of isolation that can be used for similar goals. jails style virtualization can also be used,application virtualization essentially. chroot also offers isolation. systrace is another isolation tool. You want the attacker who pwns your browser to have to go through as many additional isolation layers as possible before they can get your external IP address. Unfortunately isolation isn&#039;t perfect, I have heard of security critical chips that use 8 isolation layers being penetrated by skilled hackers.

Phyiscal isolation (airgaps) can protect you from having your encryption system bypassed on the application layer, but nothing can prevent you from theoretically being traced on the application layer other than correct code. I am not quite educated on the matter enough to say if it is literally impossible to protect from such attacks, but I have heard as much from one extremely skilled hacker friend. I have also heard some whispers about various experimental operating systems and kernels that attempt to make hacking at least a lot harder, and I believe there is some sort of &#039;provably correct&#039; system formally verified code correctness or something. I wish I knew more about this matter to share knowledge on it, I will look into the formal code correctness methods thingie some more and report back. Oh yeah systems like ASLR can also make it harder to be attacked in this way, but a skilled hacker can by pass ASLR and break through as many layers of isolation as you throw at them, code correctness is the only way to be secure from such attacks but code correctness may very well be more of a perfect ideal than something that can be fully formally verified (this is what im going to follow up on). <br /><br />As far as secure operating systems go, I would def keep your eyes on some of the research projects of various universities / research groups...qubes is the first that comes to mind but it isn&#039;t the most interesting (although it does automatically put every application you launch into its own virtual machine and other cool things)<br /><br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Formal_verification<br /><br /><br />sel4 is a formally verified kernel<br /><br />In general, security professionals tend to fall into a few sorts of group in regards to what they think the best overall strategy / technique is. I prefer defense in depth and am a fan of isolation, although some hackers I talk with think isolation like this is over rated enormously. Others think isolation like this is essentially a requirement for security. The general strategy with isolation is to add as many layers as possible for the attacker to defeat before they can root the host or gain access to IOIs, and use intrusion detection and prevention systems like snort to try and detect and remove the attacker before they breach the final layer of isolation keeping the host or IOI secure.

				While the value of making sure your Vm is secure can&#039;t be understated, I&#039;d like to call your attention to another aspect some people might wish to look into. The cost is a bit steep at first but keep in mind it would be less than the retainer for a lawyer should you be prosecuted. <br /><br />Even with disk encryption, if they want to crack it they will. Most of the time frame quotes you here about encryption like&nbsp; &quot;it would take them over a thousand years to brute force that&quot; are bullshit. Those time scales estimations are routinely based on trying to crack the encryption using cpu power. While this does get the job done eventually, the future is in using GPU computing(using your video card&#039;s processing power). It&#039;s the same hashing method used in the bitcoin protocol itself. When people solve a block, all they have done is generate hashes until one of them matched the transactions that were being verified. Anyone who has ever mined bitcoins can tell you how much faster a GPU can do this when compared to a CPU. Depending on the encryption scheme and the efficiency of the hashing code, it can cut the time needed to crack an encrypted volume by several orders of magnatude. This makes encryption just one part of a layered defense scheme. To rely on it alone is foolish.<br /><br />This brings me to my original point. VMs have their image files running off of the hard drive most times, so once the volume is decrypted, they can just load the VM up in its normal software and have access to everything in it. Even worse is that you can manipulate the data in a VM&#039;s image file without loading it up and completely bypass all access controls and system permissions. So knowing this, what I did was invest in a device called a ramdisk. How does this help? Well RAM don&#039;t hold data after the power cuts out. If you VM is stored and run from a ramdisk, when the police show up, you just pull the plug and no more data for them to screw you with. I have my rig interfaced with a garage door remote on my keyring. One button push and my rig cuts off and all the data in the ram disk goes bye bye. <br /><br />There are software ramdisks available but they are often limited to a size that&#039;s not really useful for holding what I would need unless you buy the professional versions of them. I personally went another route and actually bought a hardware ramdisk card that accepts regular computer ram and resides inside my case.<br />With as cheap as Ram is these days, i threw 16GB of ram in the card for less than 60 bucks. The card itself set me back about 300 when I bought it. This might seem expensive until you realize that most lawyers are going to ask for a few thousand dollars as a retainer to even take your case.

				That&#039;s a great tip! But it might be impractical for many people. In my neighborhood, it&#039;s not that uncommon to have power outages during particularly strong rainstorms. It&#039;d be a lot of work to set everything up again every time that happened.

The cost is a bit steep at first but keep in mind it would be less than the retainer for a lawyer should you be prosecuted. <br /><br />Even with disk encryption, if they want to crack it they will. Most of the time frame quotes you here about encryption like&nbsp; &quot;it would take them over a thousand years to brute force that&quot; are bullshit. Those time scales estimations are routinely based on trying to crack the encryption using cpu power. While this does get the job done eventually, the future is in using GPU computing(using your video card&#039;s processing power). It&#039;s the same hashing method used in the bitcoin protocol itself. When people solve a block, all they have done is generate hashes until one of them matched the transactions that were being verified. Anyone who has ever mined bitcoins can tell you how much faster a GPU can do this when compared to a CPU. Depending on the encryption scheme and the efficiency of the hashing code, it can cut the time needed to crack an encrypted volume by several orders of magnatude. This makes encryption just one part of a layered defense scheme. To rely on it alone is foolish.<br /><br />This brings me to my original point. VMs have their image files running off of the hard drive most times, so once the volume is decrypted, they can just load the VM up in its normal software and have access to everything in it. Even worse is that you can manipulate the data in a VM&#039;s image file without loading it up and completely bypass all access controls and system permissions. So knowing this, what I did was invest in a device called a ramdisk. How does this help? Well RAM don&#039;t hold data after the power cuts out. If you VM is stored and run from a ramdisk, when the police show up, you just pull the plug and no more data for them to screw you with. I have my rig interfaced with a garage door remote on my keyring. One button push and my rig cuts off and all the data in the ram disk goes bye bye. <br /><br />There are software ramdisks available but they are often limited to a size that&#039;s not really useful for holding what I would need unless you buy the professional versions of them. I personally went another route and actually bought a hardware ramdisk card that accepts regular computer ram and resides inside my case.<br />With as cheap as Ram is these days, i threw 16GB of ram in the card for less than 60 bucks. The card itself set me back about 300 when I bought it. This might seem expensive until you realize that most lawyers are going to ask for a few thousand dollars as a retainer to even take your case.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry but you are wrong.

There&#039;s only one type of DRAM chip used for actual computer RAM and it is stateless without power being supplied to it. The actual &quot;memory&quot; in your computer is not like NAND memory used in usb sticks and flash drives. Data stored in NAND is in a persistent state until until altered and requires no power to hold data once it is written. Actual RAM holds nothing persistently. This is why RAM constantly has to have the data refreshed every few nanoseconds. Freezing the ram with liquid nitrogen would do absolutely nothing as the only thing moving in the ram is electrons. It takes quite a bit of time to reach absolute zero (the point at which atoms stop moving as well as their components such as electrons) even using liquid Helium. So lets see here. Power goes off and data is GONE in lets say 25 milliseconds. If the feds have people who can somehow alter the laws of physics and timespace I&#039;m sure we would have heard about it by now so it&#039;s not even logical to expect human or machine to be able to remove a physical ramdisk device in that timeframe. On top of that, even liquid hellium could not cool it down fast enough to stop the electrons from dissipating before that data was gone forever. And let&#039;s not forget that you&#039;d be shorting out the device by submerging it into Liquid Helium(i keep using helium because liquid nitrogen can&#039;t freeze electrons in place so is useless for the scenario you mentioned). So whoever told you that line of bullshit needs to go back to school and get their MS in Comp science as I did and would know what they were speaking about.<br /><br />Let&#039;s also point out the fact that all modern operating systems use memory address randomization to help counter buffer overflow attacks in poorly written software. Even if by some miracle the data got preserved in ram, once the OS is off there is no way to tell what bits were places where in RAM. All that would be left is jumbled masses of binary values with no real way to correlate them to what they belong to. 16 gigabytes = 17 179 869 184 bytes so if you think anyone could solve that jigsaw puzzle then I&#039;ve got a really nice bridge in SF I&#039;d love to part with very cheaply.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, to the guy that mentioned frequent power outages, that&#039;s what a UPS system is for. It provides a battery backup if the power cuts out. I use one to keep the power from going out unexpectedly. That&#039;s also why I have my system set up to interface with my garage remote. I&#039;m able to turn off the pc on command and still have the battery backup for when the power goes out. And before someone tries to claim the UPS would keep the ram disk alive, not gonna happen. When your computer is turned off power remains flowing to your cmos battery, to preserve your bios settings, and to the circuts used to detect when the power button is pushed. Anything residing in a slot such as PCI, PCIE, or even ISA has no power flowing to it in this state.

CPU registers serve two purposes. 1) to hold short term data used in the cpu processing pipeline and to hold long term cpu microcode that affects the operation of the cpu itself. Where exactly do you expect to pull these magical non existent &quot;spare&quot; cpu registers from exactly? Microprocessor fabrication is a business built on economies of scale. They don&#039;t design extra transistors and registers into them if they will not be used. Every extra transistor you fab into the chip adds yet another potential failure point and increased chance of a bad yield on the product.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also you&#039;re arguing with someone with a masters in computer science based on shit you read on fucking wikipedia? You just served yourself son. I can cite thousands of goverment papers and studies claiming weed is as addictive as heroin and causes everything from crime sprees to phsycosis. Does that make them true? Hell no because even idiots get bullshit papers published. The things I&#039;ve stated here come from actual learning, hands on experience working in this field, and basic damn common sense when it comes to the laws of physics.

An attacker with a quantum computer with enough stabilized qubits can use Shors algorithm to quickly break this sort of asymmetric encryption, but the best known quantum computer attack against symmetric algorithms is grovers algorithm and it only reduces key size by 1/2 (giving a 256 bit symmetric algorithm the still unbreakable key space of 2^128). Even 128 bit symmetric keys are going to be unbreakable by such quantum computers.

				I have no issues with it really, its a really cool system and she is a smart security researcher. Qubes focuses on isolation, one of the three main strategies used by security professionals. The other strategies are correctness and randomization. Many people prefer defense in depth and like to layer the techniques as much as possible. I talk with some very very good hackers, and it is a bit surprising how much their opinions differ. Some are huge fans of using virtual machines for isolation, others think that it isn&#039;t going to stop a determined attacker (after all hackers are apparently penetrating through 8 layers of isolation in some cases). People who are big on correctness tend to use two main strategies, intensive code audits by experts looking for bugs (OpenBSD) and mathematical proofs of correctness (formal verification, like the sel4 micro kernel). The first technique allows for larger code bases to be audited, and is quite good at removing potential security vulnerabilities before they are exploited (and all together after a while). Formal verification apparently allows for a mathematic proof of correctness, but is extremely time consuming to do even for experts, and this has so far limited the ability to verify much more than micro kernels. In either case, only the audited or formally verified components can be expected to have a very high or perfect degree of correctness, and in most cases users are adding applications that have not been held to such high standards. There have not been extremely large code bases with such intensive auditing and very very little has been formally verified. Randomization attempts to protect from attacks like buffer overflows even if there are vulnerabilities in code, unlike isolation it attempts to prevent an attacker from gaining any access to the system (isolation attempts to contain malicious access). <br /><br />Most operating systems come with a variety of tools for getting security in a few different ways, but some are better for other types. For example OpenBSD has very highly audited code in its base install, and default full address space layout randomization, but it doesn&#039;t have much support at all for virtualization solutions and it has no mandatory access control system. The OpenBSD devs are security experts who seem to think pretty lowly of most types of isolation, although they do have two tools for isolation with OpenBSD, systrace and a hardened chroot. <br /><br />Likewise, Qubes has a minimized code base and probably a significant degree of correctness but they really focus more on the security benefits of isolation than on having intensive code audits. I am not sure if Qubes supports ASLR or mandatory access control systems, I will need to look into it more.<br /><br />Anyway I think Qubes is great but it really is better as a framework to build something else on top of , or to copy the concepts from. I would prefer to configure things with multiple layers of isolation used.
