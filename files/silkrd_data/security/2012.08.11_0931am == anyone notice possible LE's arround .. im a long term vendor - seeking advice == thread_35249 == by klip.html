				Bungee, do you expect encrypted messages for all correspondences? I&#039;m pretty new here and have just been scoping things out first before I make my first purchase, but have noticed that a lot of sellers prefer using PGP just for addresses and other sensitive info, and are quite annoyed if it&#039;s used for general questions. If a vendor doesn&#039;t specify anything about messaging on their profile page should I default to PGP when messaging?

				I noticed things got weird just right before April. I had a big scare one night and stopped using SR for a month, but only checking and nothing was ever mentioned about what I saw. <br /><br />Two months ago I was chatting with a member via PM and he pretty much came out and said he was a cop on accident. He kept mentioning his &quot;contacts&quot; and &quot;friends&quot; they could do an APB to locate a vendor in Canada through their &quot;resources&quot;.<br /><br />I just acted like I was dumb and had no clue and stopped communicating with them and sent a couple mods and DPR a message, but I think they just took it as paranoia.

When you&#039;re dealing with a market like SR where everything from communications, shipping, to payment is anonymous, it is far easier for them to climb down than up assuming you don&#039;t make mistakes.<br /><br />&quot;By using secure product transfer topologies, anonymizers, encryption and secure financial exchange techniques, law enforcement can be prevented from using human intelligence to move upwards in a network. Lower levels of the network are not able to compromise upwards as they do not know much or anything about the vendor they are working with. It serves little purpose to snitch on an untraceable pseudonym. This changes the threat model from the traditional human intelligence model to the more modern technical security model. Law enforcement have a far more difficult time to use technical attacks against secured networks than they have to utilize their human intelligence networks. This is for a variety of reasons, one being they are not used to operating in this way and another being technical security measures can in many cases provably ensure security from a variety of attacks.&quot;<br /><br />Source: http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/organization.html<br /><br />Someone posted that link the other day. I forgot who, but the credit goes to them.

				I always use stuff like this as a stress relief, it&#039;s always obvious when they are bent so I just give them abuse and it&#039;s a good way to get rid of the days built up frustration. Here&#039;s the latest dialogue I&#039;ve had, enjoy -&nbsp; <br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />I have recently come into the possession of several paypal accounts with bank-accounts and/or credit-cards attached.<br />Amongst them is one with a *balance* of about 6200 EUR.<br />I need to get this fast, might only be a couple of days before it gets closed down, I don&#039;t know.<br />I have tried on HackBB, but up to now no serious takers, only new users to whom I don&#039;t want to give my only PP account with a larger balance, giving out some empty accounts or CCs is another thing.<br /><br />I got the impression that you know your way around the financial playgrounds?<br />Would you like to cashout this PP for me, and if, under which conditions?<br />The account is a german one, by the way.<br />If you can think of a way to cashout the other PPs with bank accounts, that would be great, too, of course :)<br /><br />If you want to use GPG/PGP, here is my key:<br /><br />My response - <br /><br />Fuck off lol. You think I&#039;m stupid enough to fall for that?<br /><br />Jog on.<br /><br />Their response - <br /><br />?<br />what?<br /><br />I have and have been scammed a couple of times, but what about my message gave you the<br />impression that there is anything &quot;to fall for&quot; here?<br /><br />It&#039;s simple, I have several PP accounts, one with 6k EUR balance, and that balance I&#039;d like to cash out as fast as possible, because I believe it is easier to get to that money than using the PP accounts to buy some fake goods etc. .<br />And since I want it to be fast and I am looking for someone reliable you came to my mind.<br />Do you really think I would try to scam or otherwise trick an *admin* here?<br /><br />My response - <br /><br />I tell you what else is simple fool, in fact it&#039;s easier than reciting your ABCs.<br /><br />PayPal is a traceable payment method - traceable payment methods are used by Pigs to sting vendors - I do not want to lose my freedom = You can go fuck yourself with a sharpened stick.<br /><br />And yes, I do think you&#039;d try and trick me because well, that&#039;s what piggies and scammers so. Either way you are a wet fucking tissue of a human being so I suggest you jog on sharpish because you aren&#039;t pulling anything over my eyes especially not a warrant.<br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m not an Admin either, I&#039;m a Mod. Get it right.<br /><br />Give your commanding officers cock a slap and a nibble from me. ;)<br /><br />Their response - <br /><br />ok, now I see what&#039;s your problem.<br /><br />I guess you are high on your own K ;)<br /><br />I really like your graphical language, but wouldn&#039;t a simple &quot;no, thanks, no interest&quot; have sufficed?<br /><br />And dont go on telling me about traceable etc., I dont want YOUR PP, I offered to GIVE you a PP account to cash it out for me, which I know can be done quite easily if you have all the right ingredients at your disposal. I am not a noob, been around the net probably longer than you life %)<br /><br />My response - <br /><br />So you want to hand me a PP account, that you can still have control of and then trace? Sounds like a shit idea to me. Just how stupid do you think I am?<br /><br />Also no, a simple no wouldn&#039;t have sufficed because if you&#039;d read my page you&#039;d already know I&#039;m not stupid enough to be interested in this so that is an automatic green light for you to receive abuse I&#039;m afraid twunty-bollocks. I&#039;ve already put you on the suspicious accounts thread.<br /><br />Now if that&#039;s everything you&#039;d do well to piss off because we&#039;re done here. :)<br /><br />Their response - <br /><br />looks like I really made a mistake here, or rather two...<br />I actually underestimated your paranoid delusions and overestimated your intellect.<br /><br />well, have a nice roll or whatever...

When you&#039;re dealing with a market like SR where everything from communications, shipping, to payment is anonymous, it is far easier for them to climb down than up assuming you don&#039;t make mistakes.<br /><br />&quot;By using secure product transfer topologies, anonymizers, encryption and secure financial exchange techniques, law enforcement can be prevented from using human intelligence to move upwards in a network. Lower levels of the network are not able to compromise upwards as they do not know much or anything about the vendor they are working with. It serves little purpose to snitch on an untraceable pseudonym. This changes the threat model from the traditional human intelligence model to the more modern technical security model. Law enforcement have a far more difficult time to use technical attacks against secured networks than they have to utilize their human intelligence networks. This is for a variety of reasons, one being they are not used to operating in this way and another being technical security measures can in many cases provably ensure security from a variety of attacks.&quot;<br /><br />Source: http://pz65gyca5nrafhrf.onion/PolyFront_2/organization.html<br /><br />Someone posted that link the other day. I forgot who, but the credit goes to them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 for reposting that very apropos quote.&nbsp; The PolyFront authors are correct, with respect to the current capabilities of police. That said, it would be a grave mistake to assume that this will always be the case. Officers my age (or older) who did not grow up with computers are the ones who are having the most trouble with the new reality.&nbsp; As new officers are hired, they will be people who will have grown up with computers, and are far more comfortable with them than their predecessors ever could be. <br /><br />While I believe the PolyFront authors are mostly correct, in the above-quoted segment, I nevertheless believe that they have made a fundamental error in underestimating the utility of traditional policing techniques.&nbsp; <br /><br />Policing, after all, is about people, and criminal activity is, by and large, a type of social activity.&nbsp; The vast majority of criminals are not solitary -- they do not operate without involving at least some associates. If one studies law enforcement tactics, one discovers that it is through one&#039;s associates that one is often undone. <br /><br />The case of Max Butler is one such. Butler was known as &quot;the carding King&quot; due to his takeover of several online carding markets. Butler was employed by day as a computer seucrity consultant; by night, he operated the carding markets. As might be expected, Butler was extremely thorough with respect to the technical measures he employed to prevent detection/apprehension. <br /><br />Where Butler completely and totally screwed the pooch was in his choice of associates. His associate knew too much about his business, and was sloppy to boot. The associate was nabbed by police, and in the process of cutting a deal for himself, he rolled-over on Butler, giving them the details he knew about his operation. <br /><br />How many vendors are sole operators? I would imagine not that many. You have associates, people you buy from, people you deal with in other ways. All of these represent a risk, and no amount of high-tech geekery, however advanced, is going to help you in this regard. This is where traditional policing methods come in. <br /><br />Remember Benjamin Franklin&#039;s famous aphorism: &quot;Three people can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;<br /><br />Some of you may remember the quote from the movie Dirty Harry, where Inspector Harry Callahan says to his new partner, &quot;A junkie whore with a big mouth can crack a case wide open ten times faster than the crime lab.&quot; <br /><br />When the Soviets operated clandestine espionage cells in the United States, they were generally composed of &#039;cells&#039; comprising a maximum of 4-6 people each. <br /><br />Why was this? Because if one cell member was apprehended, he could only rat-out the other members of his tiny cell, and not the larger network. Compartmentalization is King. <br /><br />I have seen the following aphorism stated, and I believe it to be true: &quot;Today&#039;s trusted associate is tomorrow&#039;s informant.&quot; <br /><br />Moral of the story, insofar as is possible, TRUST NO ONE. Ensure that your business is known to no one else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree, too many people on here underestimate LE or overestimate their own ability to detect cops/snitches. Yeah, tor and btc is great and all, but it only goes so far. The feds have some extremely talented people working for them, not to mention 3rd party contractors that write exploit code and perform other tech services for the various TLAs. I am not referring to the DEA either.<br /><br />Believe it or not, some of their most effective cybercrime agents are pushing 50 now. They sit there all day and manipulate people in communities like this without them even realizing. It shouldn&#039;t be difficult to see why people who devote their entire professional careers to finding ways inside these groups are so successful, especially since most SR users haven&#039;t been doing this sort of things for years. Also, the feds are a team. Like Anonymous, they do not sleep, or eat, or forgive, forget, etc. If you miss a crucial step in something and slip up, they&#039;ll be there waiting.<br /><br />The moral of this story is to stay on your toes. Don&#039;t temporarily drop your guard for someone who just happens to be pleasant to talk to, and seems to think like you. If you are too high to make the right decision here, sign out and go chill somewhere else. Like guru said, TRUST NO ONE that absolutely doesn&#039;t need to know about what you are doing. Obviously vendors should take this advice far more seriously than buyers ordering grams of pot.

I see a lot of people on here talking about their enormous 16256-bit keys kept on special USB keychains and their various other forms of cryptographic and technological security. And don&#039;t get me wrong, that&#039;s all very useful and commendable: I use GPG myself and wouldn&#039;t buy from a vendor who didn&#039;t, and I do my best not to reveal personal details about my life outside the Grand Wizard&#039;s Lair. <br /><br />But, at the end of the day, I am still sending my personal information to people who can decrypt it.&nbsp; And if any of those people have been busted for online or offline activities, there is a non-trivial chance they will provide that info to law enforcement if they think it will save them some hard time.&nbsp; And by &quot;non-trivial&quot; I mean it&#039;s more likely than not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the &quot;gangsters,&quot; &quot;godfathers,&quot; &quot;hustlers&quot; etc. on SR aren&#039;t streetwise hardened criminals. A few minutes with a skilled interrogator will have them singing like canaries and doing whatever the nice man with the badge tells them to do.&nbsp; And if that includes fulfilling some bulk orders and setting the recipients up for their own busts, then so be it: most people will gladly ruin the lives of a few strangers to save their own asses.&nbsp; <br /><br />If/when we start seeing SR busts, I&#039;m betting they will involve a vendor getting popped offline and then working with the feds in exchange for immunity or leniency.&nbsp; I think the technology will continue to do its job just fine.&nbsp; But if LE can compromise a vendor, they can pull in all kinds of slightly smaller fishies.&nbsp; And the sloppier your vendor is and the more you are buying, the more likely it is you will find yourself hooked. The technological precautions are fabulous, but if you&#039;re not careful you might find yourself falling headlong into this particular security hole despite them.

Used improperly, much of that protection can be lost. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I bitched on another thread about vendors who offer bitcoins for WU, Moneypak or even bank deposits alongside their listings for various illegal substances.&nbsp; It would be a trivial matter for LE to i.e. exchange a Moneypak with JoeCrank and then use those bitcoins to buy a few grams of JoeCrank&#039;s crystal.&nbsp; Once that arrives a quick subpoena reveals all the information JoeCrank provided to get the reloadable card.&nbsp; And if Joe cleverly registered using someone else&#039;s name and address, a quick look at the last few transactions on the card may give valuable clues as to his identity.&nbsp; If he did a withdrawal at a local ATM, another quick subpoena will provide video of that transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if he paid his utility bills with that card, he&#039;s as good as busted.<br /><br />Given that Joe didn&#039;t have the common sense to avoid leaving a huge trail of breadcrumbs to his own location, how much do you want to rely on his security skills in protecting your own personal information? And what do you suppose the odds are that the DEA could lean on Joe for a bit to keep his listings up -- then pop a few mid-to-small timers and issue a press release entitled &quot;SILK ROAD METHAMPHETAMINE RING BUSTED!!!&quot;?&nbsp; I know I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to trust this guy with my address no matter how carefully I encrypted it.&nbsp; And there are quite a few JoeCranks selling on SR as we speak.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let&#039;s not forget about buyers who, in their excitement over finding this place, literally --&nbsp; and I mean quite literally -- throw all caution to the winds. <br /><br />One case stands out: someone setup an account under their real name, linked to their real email address. Email address links to half-a-dozen social networking sites, containing among other things, poster&#039;s real name, address, phone number.&nbsp; Tons of photos on photo-sharing sites, including one photo of themselves they used as their avatar.&nbsp; I just about shit a brick. The funny thing was, while they admitted they were foolish to have done this, they didn&#039;t appear to be terribly concerned over it either. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL, whoever that was needs to be taken out to the pastures and shot. It would be the kindest thing to do.

But I like the idea behind this. What about a site feature where a seller could flag the user as &quot;suspicious&quot;? The users themselves would not not be able to check their own suspicion level, but other sellers would be able to see something like &quot;5 other vendors have flagged this user as suspicious.&quot; This way, their reputation would grow completely unaware to them.

				The fact that the US gov won&#039;t release information about SilkRoad under the freedom of information act with the statement &quot;We have undercover officers working there&quot; means they&#039;re here, and probably have been since it was first brought to attention by a senator back in June 2011.
