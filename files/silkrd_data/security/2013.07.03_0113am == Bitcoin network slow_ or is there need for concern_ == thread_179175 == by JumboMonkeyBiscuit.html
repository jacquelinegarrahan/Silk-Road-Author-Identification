				I was wondering if anyone else was having this issue. I made a BTC withdraw not long after the site came back up this evening. It is still not showing up as pending for my external wallet.? Is the network moving slower since the down time this evening or is there a problem here I should be concerned about. <br /><br />Thank you in advance for your assistance here.<br /><br />JmB

				Hello Libertas and thank you for the response. I am wondering a few things. <br /><br />My coins were removed from my user account but they are still here in SR tumblr per say? <br /><br />When do you anticipate the lift on the temporary hold of withdraws?<br /><br />Are user to user transfers still being completed or are they on hold as well?<br /><br />Thank you in advance. I like the updates so far. Keep up the hard work.<br /><br />JmB
