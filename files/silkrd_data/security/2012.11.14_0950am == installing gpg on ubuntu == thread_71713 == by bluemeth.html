				you might already have gpg installed on your distro.<br /><br />type into the terminal<br />gpg --help<br /><br />and if it comes up with a list of commands then it&#039;s already installed. it was good to go on my distro (unless i&#039;d already installed it without realising but unlikely)<br /><br />this will give you pretty much everything you need to know about using it at the command line<br /><br />https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto

				Sounds like you downloaded the source code for the program.&nbsp; Linux is very different than windows... it&#039;s not uncommon to download the source code for a program and actually compile it yourself into an executable before installing it on your computer.<br /><br />It means almost everything that you run in Linux is custom-built for your specific CPU and stuff, so it&#039;s awfully efficient... but it&#039;s an awful pain a lot of the time too.&nbsp; In Ubuntu, just use &quot;apt-get&quot; or &quot;aptitude&quot; to install stuff.&nbsp; Ubuntu has pre-made packages for practically everything, so you can almost always just type &quot;apt-get install URMOM&quot; and it&#039;ll just download and install it all for you.

				No offense to the kind fellow who suggested it, but I don&#039;t think you want emacs. It&#039;s a programmer&#039;s text editor and will probably just be confusing for you -- it&#039;s got great stuff, so it&#039;s worth learning if you write programs and whatnot, but... otherwise, unless it&#039;s fun for you just don&#039;t bother.&nbsp; kword is fine :)<br /><br />So your regular user account doesn&#039;t have permission to change system files, and installing software is included in that.&nbsp; Hence the sudo.&nbsp; It said it didn&#039;t exist because it doesn&#039;t :)&nbsp; What you want to do is try typing &quot;sudo aptitude search NAME&quot; -- often using the exact name of the program works nicely, but sometimes they&#039;re named oddly.&nbsp; Like firefox is actually a package named &quot;mozilla-firefox&quot; I think, if an example is helpful (Mozilla is the organization that maintains Firefox).<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have &quot;aptitude&quot; installed yet, type exactly this: `sudo apt-get install aptitude` w/o quotes and it&#039;ll install it.&nbsp; Also, in linux, a space means a break between two things.&nbsp; Basically. I mean long story short -- not *always*, but by typing &quot;install gnu macs&quot; the program thought you were asking it to install two programs, one named &quot;gnu&quot; and one names &quot;macs&quot;.&nbsp; If you want a space in something, then put quotes around it.&nbsp; Like this line it would treat as installing one program even though it&#039;s two different words:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">sudo apt-get install &quot;gnu macs&quot;<br /></code>Now that program doesn&#039;t exist, but it&#039;s just an example of how to say you mean one thing with two different words.<br /><br /><br />Hope that&#039;s a helpful start for you; I&#039;m afraid Linux is awfully confusing if you don&#039;t have much experience with computers.&nbsp; Try www.linuxquestions.org if you need more help (but dear God, don&#039;t expect them to be okay with trying to buy drugs or anything, FYI).<br /><br />
