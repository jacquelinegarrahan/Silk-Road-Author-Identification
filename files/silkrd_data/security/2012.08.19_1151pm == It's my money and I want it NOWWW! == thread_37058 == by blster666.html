				All jokes aside. This question is for all sellers that price their COKE at a price that makes it too expensive for even a middle class individual feel like they&#039;re paying way too much for this product. <br /><br />Now almost everyone is selling 1g at over 10 coins which is something around $160+ real MONEY out of your hard earned wallet...money that any buyer will need to deposit in order to get a those 10coins.<br /><br />So when I see your listings at 120 or 130 per g, are you aware that we can&#039;t just deposit that much and get that much back in order to purchase your product? <br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m fairly new here and the this is the only thing I haven&#039;t read much upon (COINS). Can someone please explain to me why I only got 10.+ coins after paying $160&nbsp; plus $3.95 fee which came out to $154 bucks after bitinstant route to instawallet. <br /><br />So right now as I&#039;m typing this I&#039;m tempted to make my first purchase but can&#039;t afford it because my 160 deposit is not good enough for 1g. Back in NY that would buy me a 8-ball. I honestly don&#039;t think this is fair at all. It&#039;s not like we&#039;re not taking risks either. I mean, we&#039;re the ones that are giving you our real addresses and names. Why can&#039;t it be a win-win for both? As a matter of fact, this way is SAFER for you as a seller compared to driving around with it. Cmon now! really? Serious!<br /><br />I want this post to be open for a mature discussion and I&#039;m not trying to start a war or anything like that. I&#039;m just trying to understand what I don&#039;t know. Why can&#039;t SR come up with a diff method of safe money transfers? Heck, I&#039;m domestic and only looking to buy domestic so does one need to rely on coins? Isn&#039;t it obvious that everyone is getting fukked by this?

				seems like u bought coins at $15 and there now $8-9 so yeah you will be way short <br /><br />always deposit a bit more and only buy coins when you are ready to order so u should only wait 2 hours at most and sr use weighted average i think so they wont drop like they have in 2 hours<br /><br />basicly u 10 coins =$90 and will be $80 soon u need to do more reading about how shit works.to be fair youve been unlucky they been rising for weeks and dropped like a stone last days<br /><br />the prices are pegged to the dollar so bit value means nothing to the prices they&nbsp; stay the same coins go up and down and it dosnt impact buyers really ,lots of people seem to think when coins go up they lose out but it makes no difference unless u do what u did and buy coins and&nbsp; dont order for&nbsp; days and they drop big time

				regardless of the BTC cost the blow around SR is over priced. I would love to get some blow, but not at these prices. But i can live without it. I follow the rumor mill and there are good sellers out there. I would drop a 100 US for a G but not much more than that. the 80&#039;s are over...

				i dont do coke so dont look but i thought it was more like $110-$130 <br /><br />everythings expensive&nbsp; on here apart from a few gems u find so of course if u can score good quality on street u dont score here <br /><br />i only do h and in uk h is shit so its worth paying more for dutch stuff but if u scared to get international then yes it limits u<br /><br />coke in uk is shit aswell and if u want half decent u pay £100 a g and u get much cheaper here from nl so i suppose it depends were u are and street quality

It is way too expensive and I just can&#039;t figure out why? It is actually much more convenient for the seller and I had to say this but it comes across as they&#039;re praying on the paranoid feeble mind. (no offense) I&#039;m one myself but paranoid for a good reason. I consider myself as a professional (as everyone here) and the last thing I want is get caught with that stuff. <br /><br />Why can&#039;t the SR site put a max cap on this stuff? this way it can act as a fair regulation between sellers. I know there are some providers that offer somewhat okay price but all are overseas and that is something I wont dare to touch. Domestic ONLY!<br /><br />I have just lil bit over 10.+ in coins so anyone out there who ships domestic please free to PM if you&#039;re willing to work with that..I&#039;m looking to place my order this wed.

				You guys are just seeing the left over listings, that&#039;s like all the noobies complaining that &quot;insert drug name here&quot; is overpriced. I sell coke for $105 a gram and $300 a ball, the higher you go the better price you get, domestic fluffy white goodness! Obviously, the listings sell out in a second and then you have no choice but to choose the $140g guy or the $150g guy. <br /><br />Be a smart shopper, find some vendors you like, talk to them and build up a relationship with them and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll hook you up, I know I hook up all my good customers&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah blstr666, you got into the market at the exact wrong time. Pirateat40 and his maybe-maybe-not-ponzi scheme are severely messing up the bitcoin price. It&#039;s usually quite volatile, but this week is something special. <br />Better luck next time, and spend your coins as fast as possible to avoid this in the future.

				blster u really still not getting it the prices are in dollars fuck your 10coins costing $160 it means nothing ,u lost out coz u didnt understand and they dropped in value like the banks share prices did<br />&nbsp;<br />the prices are in dollars change it u might grasp what is happening&nbsp; <br /><br />go to setting change to $ not coins<br /><br />your 10 coins arnt worth $160 there worth $90 so if a vendor is charging 11 coins its $99.<br /><br />the dollar price stays the same the bit coin price changes every time they go up or down in value .the vendors prices arnt changing <br /><br />if u dont understand this then id quit now and come back when u do<br /><br />to buy 11 coins wouldnt cost $200 it would cost&nbsp; a $100 ish<br />

				For others new to this and reading this thread, as well as OP, look at it like this:<br /><br />When you go to SR or similar sites you are traveling to a section of the internet with its own currency, much like traveling to a different country. When you travel to countries that use other currencies you have to buy the local currency when you arrive and buy back your home currency when you leave. This is equivalent to buying goods on SR and selling them, respectively. The nice thing about the real world&#039;s currency exchange rates is that they, relatively speaking, don&#039;t fluctuate that much during your trip to another country, because there is a large volume (liquid) and no big players can really affect the rate to their advantage, even central banks.<br /><br />BTC on the other hand, while being very beneficial to this community due to its inherently difficult nature of tracing transactions to actual people, has downsides because it is a lot more volatile of a currency than GBP, USD, EUR, etc. Because of this the price can wildly fluctuate in hours or days and leave some people standing there with their dick in their hands. Also because of this, people that own a lot of currency can dump a bunch of it rapidly and drive the price down, then buy back when the price is low and make a nice profit.<br /><br />Ultimately the way to protect yourself from this is to use fast sources of exchanging your currency to BTC and staying on top of it, like using bitinstant, as well as transferring your funds from an intermediary wallet to SR (or another wallet first, but each tumble costs time as the BTC blockchain has to confirm transactions) and place your order as soon as possible. When I buy bitcoin I always add some to account for the currency exchange transaction rates (usually 5% plus a little) and then add 1-2 BTC, as it can sometimes&nbsp; fluctuate this much in the time it takes to place an order. Do these things and use trusted vendors and you will be fine. Sorry you got the shitty end of this BTC bear market and hopefully you don&#039;t get too deterred from it all.
