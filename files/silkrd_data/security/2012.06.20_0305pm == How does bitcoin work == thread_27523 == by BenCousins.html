				OK, so im not overly familiar with BTC and how the system works so forgive me for being ignorant. At the moment i just purchase BTC via cash deposit and get it deposited straight into my SR account and then spend etc. Ive installed a BTC wallet on my computer but im wondering what happens if say:<br /><br />my harddrive/computer/OS gets fucked and i need to completely reformatt losing everything?<br /><br />computer gets stolen?<br /><br />computer gets infected with spyware/keylogger? (probably fucked in general if this happens)<br /><br />LE get hold of my computer?<br /><br />or any other sort of event that would compromise my bitcoins as my understanding my BTC are installed in my wallet on my computer? inst it safer to have it in an online/cloud wallet?<br />can anyone explain how you get around this. Once again i apologize if im being ignorant<br />Ben

It would be a very simple way of identifying SR users, as a high proportion of Bitcoin users are probably also involved in Silk Road one way or another. After they&#039;ve identified you as a Bitcoin user, they could just search your post anyway and pretend it was an &quot;anonymous tip-off&quot; of some kind. <br /><br />The people behind the great drug war scam will stop at nothing to criminalize users, even if it involves breaking the law to do so. They really hate us, you know

				You guys should look at blockchain explorer and try and pinpoint someones IP that sent or received BTC... &quot;not easy&quot; <br /><br /><br />Why do you think your deposit addy changes after each deposit? <br /><br />I have never washed my coins, You should never deposit directly in to your SR account... Use an online wallet or bitcoin-qt client... <br /><br /><br />if your buying your coins with cash and using TOR your fine.... quit being paranoid.

				OK, I had to look up pywallet to see what that is. It&#039;s software to import wallet data or something like that. Isn&#039;t that method you just described incredibly dangerous, I mean from the viewpoint of security? I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want any of my wallet data floating around in an online wallet.

				Ben<br /><br />If you&#039;re really concerned about losing your wallet, then as I say, look up the Brain Wallet thread. It&#039;s much more reliable than Instawallet and so on, because the only person you have to trust is yourself. Not the case with online wallets.

				Not quite.<br /><br />If you use an online wallet, some encoded version of your private key MUST be communicated to the wallet service provider, the service couldn&#039;t operate otherwise. This is a security risk IMO, albeit a very small one (a hashed or salted key would require a strongly motivated attacker to devote the resources into cracking it, i.e. you&#039;d need to have lots of money in the wallet and the attacker would have to know which out of 1000&#039;s of hashed keys was yours)<br /><br />If you follow Vl4d1m1r&#039;s instructions, but instead of importing the private key into an online wallet, import it into a Bitcoin client on your machine instead, you will get all the benefits of Brain Wallets, and none of the drawbacks (as long as you can hide your real IP when using the wallet, of course)

This is a security risk IMO, albeit a very small one (a hashed or salted key would require a strongly motivated attacker to devote the resources into cracking it, i.e. you&#039;d need to have lots of money in the wallet and the attacker would have to know which out of 1000&#039;s of hashed keys was yours)<br /><br />If you follow Vl4d1m1r&#039;s instructions, but instead of importing the private key into an online wallet, import it into a Bitcoin client on your machine instead, you will get all the benefits of Brain Wallets, and none of the drawbacks (as long as you can hide your real IP when using the wallet, of course)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A much better suggestion AbraCadaver many thanks - I did think about this but didn&#039;t want to overcomplicate the instructions by adding steps to download and install the Bitcoin client. I will do a &quot;further to&quot; on how to do this if anyone&#039;s interested.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is hiding my IP as simple as checking that box in the options of my Bitcoin client that &quot;torifys&quot; it or is there more to it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I think that&#039;s it!<br /><br />V.
