				My order confirmation email from bitcopia tells me to go to any Wells Fargo branch and deposit my payment into &quot;bitcopia&quot;. They did not provide any account number or anything.Weird. So am I suppose to go to the teller and and say &quot;Hey. i&#039;d like to deposit so and so amount to &quot;bitcopia&quot;? Can we all get together right now and find an alternative to this bitinstant delay? Also can somebody provide clear step by step instructions on how to use bitcopia? Thanks you all.<br /><br />

				Let me put exactly what the transaction confirmation email said in regards on how to deposit. <br /><br />Cash deposit instructions : Please deposit cash in to the account &#039;Bitcopia&#039; an any Wells Fargo Location within two hours of placing order. Cash deposited more than two hours after placing order is subject to order cancellation with a $20 return charge. Do no deposit checks.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				bitinstant website is down or not working right pretty often.&nbsp; I successfully bought a couple hundred dolllars with bitinstant cash pay at the moneygram store near me 2 days ago, all went smoothly.&nbsp; pretty cheap overall. the moneygram process asks for name and phone and such, but they never checked my ID or anything so I suppose you can do it anonymously, I dont know if they check a database for name address or whatever, I gave them my real name, but moved the bitcoins around some to account for that .

				Yeah, bitcopia sounds pretty good...I&#039;ve spent day checking out new options, and none of them are as &#039;anonymous&#039; as we&#039;d like, but bank deposits are fine, and bitcopia is doing what several other previous btc vendors have done w/bank deposits...we used to have to send a phone/photo of the deposit, but now as long as you get in there within the time frame, seems to work alright...<br /><br />MtGox--and TradeHill when it was rolling--used to be a lot simpler, but all the ripoffs and shit, made them bring bitinstant into the game, and now need more identification, either at mtGox, for Dwolla...or at OKPay, to use them, so we depend on bitinstant, and I&#039;ve had money tied up w/them before and that sucks...<br /><br />so for me, bitcopia is simplest....today ;) (tomorrow, this all could change)

				I went through some crazy uncomfortable ways about trying to get BTC. All of them worked however, it&#039;s not nice being on closed circuit camera in any establishment. Honestly, the easiest way I&#039;ve found is to go buy a MoneyPak and send Chronic Crew the information through his feedback listing. Viola, BTC in my SR ACCT... however I don&#039;t know if I have BTC right now because I can&#039;t get into SR ;(<br /><br />I know there was some drama with CC a little while back but, he totally squared up with everyone. I freaked out for a couple days like some others but, we all got our BTC in the end. He only takes 5% and that ain&#039;t bad!

The process is quick just fill out a deposit slip and hand that and the money to the teller and you are leaving 15-20 seconds later.

				I had great success with bitme. You have to send them a scan or picture of the receipt to complete the transaction. Little to no fees essentially.

It is currently 4.9% as BTC price and demand are rising. The sell percentage is at 2.9% as it is on the opposite side of price and demand.&quot;<br />That was when I messaged Bitcopia in November 2012 about several questions I had and so I could get a feel for them. Always great communication. Still have yet to try. Plan to try them when BTC prices go down a little.
