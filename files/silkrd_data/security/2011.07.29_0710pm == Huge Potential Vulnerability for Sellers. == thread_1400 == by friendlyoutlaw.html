				So, I love Silk Road. This place makes me feel like a revolutionary.<br /><br />Thus, I feel obligated to report something that occurred to me while I was smoking a bowl last night...<br /><br />If I was law enforcement, the easiest way to get after the sellers is simply this:<br /><br />- Order various size orders of product from various &quot;prominent&quot; domestic vendors, using bitcoin, PGP, the whole nine yards. Nothing to arouse suspicion.<br /><br />- Receive product. Note where the product shipped from (it&#039;s postmarked, right?) and create a compendium of photographs documenting what the packaging looks like. Without revealing anything specific, based on the several orders I have personally received so far, it seems like many sellers would be easily pigeonholed, either based on the return address, labeling of the package, or other giveaway.<br /><br />- Work with the local post office to determine where the product is being picked up, based on having the workers watch for the suspicious packages. Is it being dropped off at the main office? Is it being stuffed in a particular drop box? Then it&#039;s a simple matter of watching and waiting for the dealer to ship something in the future.<br /><br />While this seems like a bit much to go through, remember that these law enforcement types will go to crazy lengths for high publicity busts. I suspect they have been chomping at the bit for something to use to scare people away from this site, once they realized they couldn&#039;t take it down directly.<br /><br />Moral of the story? Do not get lazy. Do not ship your products using the same routines. Change your return labels, change your envelopes, switch drop-off locations regularly. The more rural and less populated the area, the greater the chances of you sticking out. It would be quite tough to track somebody down in Chicago...but in the middle of Kansas? Maybe not.

				Sadly this should be common sense but I think your post will enlighten alot of the vendors here.<br /><br />The best was the kid with a plastic bag over his hand as he shoves a package in the mailbox while a suspicious woman watches and as he leaves run inside the post office.<br /><br />That kid needs to read posts like this.

				Yes. Always use a new return address and drop box every time. Always use printed labels and USPS packing materials. Make it blend in seamlessly with the rest of the mail. Throw a fake ebay sticker on it if you wish even. :)
