If you used an anonymous method such as cash to buy them then it won&#039;t matter if your Bitcoin wallet address can be linked to SR. <br /><br />To answer your question though, there&#039;s nothing particularly special about SR wallet addresses and analysis of the block chain by itself wouldn&#039;t allow someone to know that Bitcoins had been sent there unless there was some corroborating evidence e.g a vendor withdrew Bitcoins from their SR wallet to MtGox and then their own bank account.<br /><br />V.<br />

				btc transfers can be tied to ip addresses. so if you log in to mt gox at home (cuz gox don&#039;t let you use tor) and move the btc straight from gox to your sr account, they could tie the sr account to your ip address and thus you. <br /><br />so, never go on your mt gox at home<br />use public wifis<br />move your btcs multiple times and split em up<br />all new gox accounts &amp; wallets for everything, every time

Instead, send it to bitcoin fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion), then from there you can, from Tor, send them to SR. It&#039;s much safer that way.<br /><br />goblin

				bitcoin is not illegal. you can send them where you want.<br />if you are selling legitimate items somewhere else, to who ever, then you can just give them your SR wallet addy. to send the coin to.<br />but that is already done with mixers ???<br /><br />also instawallet can be accessed using TOR, last time i checked.

It&#039;s important to stress that SR&#039;s own mixer is only used when withdrawing BTC from an existing SR wallet address i.e it&#039;s only any good to you when your Bitcoins reach SR.<br /><br />If you do use a bank account / Western Union / other traceable method to purchase your Bitcoins I would strongly recommend running the coins through Bitcoinfog before sending them on to your SR wallet.<br /><br />V.
