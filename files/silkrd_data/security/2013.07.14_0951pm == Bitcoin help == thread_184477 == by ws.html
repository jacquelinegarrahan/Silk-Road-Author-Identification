				Hi guys when I first joined SR had a message with links to read about things to do, creating live USB, getting bitcoin anonymously etc. This link has gone from my inbox now, I am still yet to make a purchase on here but dont understand the bitcoin thing fully, I have asked on other theads but get no replies.<br /><br />Where I am at, I have tails, persistent volume and follwed the guide from getting an electrum bitcoin wallet on USB.<br /><br />I am in UK, I think most people around here recommend localbitcoins, I just dont understand how to get the coins exactly?<br /><br />What is the address for my electrum wallet from localbitcoin seller to send to?<br />I see an address in my SR account am I meant to give them this? If so what is the point of electrum wallet?<br />What is recommended to clean coins to be as anonymous as possible?<br /><br />I think this is pretty much all I need to know to get started but need some expert advice first as I am always really paranoid about security!<br /><br />Thanks in advance for anyone who can help me out!

				hi i just use qtbitcoin wallet you just download and install it.... as for buying bitcoins look up your local trading site. I think you guys have mtgox there in the uk. here in canada its cavirtex. there are other wallets you can download as well that you dont associate your name with and you can kind of launder the bitcoins by sending them from wallet to wallet..... im sure other people have wayyyy better methods than that but thats a pretty basic one. hope that helps ya. dont buy bitcoins from like ebay or other sites p2p sites... unless u have some money to burn cuz its really really easy to get ripped off. thats why i go with the bitcoin trading sites.
