				Unless your ISP is actively blocking connections to the Tor network (in which case you would need bridges), you have nothing to worry about.

				You can do VPN ---&gt; Tor so your ISP does not see the traffic since it&#039;s encrypted on your local machine and decrypted at the VPN provider (after being routed through your ISP).

				download tor with obfsproxy, and even better make your own obfsproxy bridge and connect to it<br />now local spying won&#039;t matter. and yes, it does matter if your ISP can see you&#039;re using Tor, just ask Jeremy Hammond the lulzsec hax0r that ended up in prison because the FBI agents parked down the block triangulated his wireless signal and timed when he signed on to tor and when his nym popped in on Sabu&#039;s snitch IRC channel

				I just called my friend working at my ISP and asked if it&#039;s ok to have i2p &amp; tor relays.<br />She told me no problem.<br />SO IMHO if your ISP doesn&#039;t mind you are ok to use Tor.. anyway its usage does not even prove you browse anything anonymously.

				The only thing US ISP&#039;s care about when using TOR is that if you are running a bridge that is passing illegal traffic back and forth (torrents of copyrighted material, etc.). Just like everyone else said VPN then TOR if you want to be super safe. TOR on the go is good, hopping between cell networks, proxies, vpn&#039;s, and the TOR network.

				So is using tor at home without any other protection going to cause a red flag at ISP? Not using wireless and not transferring any large files. I keep getting my internet connection dropped today.

They knew who to pen tap in the first place. If used properly, Tor will prevent you from being identified. Hammond got busted because he ran his mouth and revealed too many personal details. So don&#039;t do that, on this forum or anywhere else. <br /><br />Hammond also had a persistent presence on the IRC channel, which made a low tech correlation attack on him easy. That is considerably harder if you&#039;re posting on a forum or sending emails, or just browsing around.<br /><br />Lastly, Hammond was involved in multiple hacks on high value targets, including stealing a million dollars through fraudulent credit card charges. LE won&#039;t be doing that kind of investigation on people buying a few pills over the internet. What happened to Hammond should not be in your threat model.
