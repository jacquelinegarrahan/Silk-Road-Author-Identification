It would be very easy to use security camera footage to tell who had made a deposit if necessary - the solution? Use my Bitcoin for cash in the mail service (please see link below), it&#039;s safe and reliable as not even I will know who you are, it&#039;s the way things should be!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				just to clarify,,,,,,you can make cash deposits over the counter,,but i have noticed a message on mtgox site stating that they dont guaarantee that cash deposits will make it to your account,,so im taking this as they dont want cash deposits and are saying this to maybe stop people from doing so,,just wondered if anybody has noticed this b4 as i&nbsp; have only started using mygox recently

				It will most probably show up. Mt.Gox is known for slower transactions over these kind of payments, as well as bank transfers/wires. You can look up their Facebook page and see some people commenting about the slow transactions/bad feedback. I believe there is some dude who`s on his 11th+ day waiting for his funds to be deposited. I wish they would sort things out or state them properly otherwise instead of buying/setting up new office desks and chairs. :(

As for feedback I`ve got some from them, with really late answers/explanations which should have been given on the first day. Looks like you have no problem then, I actually live right next to them (come at me boys) and told them how shameful their service was. They were left speechless and dumbfounded.&nbsp;

I know this as I started out as a Cashier -the only real advantage to depositing cash over the counter is that it won&#039;t be possible tell you sent money to a Bitcoin exchange by examining your own bank&#039;s records.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course you can say I&#039;m biased as I sell Bitcoins for cash in the mail but I started this service to supply a demand as in order to use Bitcoins safely you must first obtain them anonymously - cash in the mail is one method to do this as is selling products/services in exchange for Bitcoin.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

You will receive an email when funds are credited.<br /><br /><br />Note: Direct cash deposits should not be made, as they may not be credited.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course it&#039;s not clear whether this is because Barclays is notoriously unreliable at tacking on reference numbers to cash deposits (don&#039;t take my word for it, try it for yourself!) or because they want to know the identity of every person buying Bitcoins but I think it&#039;s safe to say that until we hear otherwise you should only deposit as much cash as you can afford to lose!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
