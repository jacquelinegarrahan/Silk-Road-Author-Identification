				I have just logged into forum for a browse and received this inbox message, wonder if anyone else has received it? Is it really SR admin or should I be worried?<br /><br />Good Morning,<br /><br />We have reason to believe your account on the main site has been accessed without your authorization. Obviously, we would like to rectify this as soon as possible. Please reply to this message with your username for the main site and at least one recent transaction. We can then explain what has happened and rectify the situation if there is one.<br /><br />Silk Road Admin

				Hmm good question, however I don&#039;t think they will message you. It could be a scammer looking to get some details on your account so that they can say you forgot the password and have it changed.<br />Be very careful, I would contact support and not reply to that message.

				Good idea, first alert is they are asking for your username... If there was an issue they would already know your username.
