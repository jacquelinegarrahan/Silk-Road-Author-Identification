				Total number of Bitcoins hits 10.5 million, production halves to stop inflation<br /><br />Can technology replace the Federal Reserve?<br /><br />By Adrianne Jeffries on November 28, 2012 10:44 am<br /><br /><br />The total number of Bitcoins in circulation just hit 10.5 million, triggering a safeguard against inflation that was hardcoded into the digital currency. This means a drastic change in the number of new Bitcoins being created, which is expected to have a huge impact on the economy that has been developing around the ecurrency.<br /><br />The safeguard has to do with the &quot;block reward,&quot; the number of Bitcoins that can be created at a time, which has dropped from 50 to 25. Bitcoin miners, geeks who configure their own computers to mint the cultish digital currency, have been waiting for this moment for a long time â€” about four years, which is how long Bitcoins have been in circulation.<br /><br />&quot;The sudden scarcity of new coins is likely to drive the value of Bitcoins up&quot;<br /><br />The sudden scarcity of new coins is likely to drive the value of Bitcoins up, as fewer new coins enter the system and current Bitcoin owners hoard their stashes. It&#039;s also possible that the change will simply trigger a period of instability due to the sudden change in the money supply. Another factor could add to the turmoil: new chips custom-built for Bitcoin mining will make the process many times more powerful and efficient.<br /><br />Exactly who designed Bitcoin is still a mystery. However, the ecurrency was engineered so that the technology could automatically adjust itself, replacing the need for a central monetary authority like the Federal Reserve. The block reward change is just one of many safeguards built into the protocol, which has been hailed as a masterful technological and economic accomplishment.<br /><br />Bitcoin has been hailed as a revolutionary populist movement, but it&#039;s also a grand economic experiment. The market&#039;s reaction in the coming weeks will be the first major test of whether technology can replace government&#039;s role in regulating money.<br /><br /><br />Source:<br />hxxp://www.theverge.com/2012/11/28/3701434/total-number-of-bitcoins-hits-10-5-million-production-halves-to-stop<br /><br />Further reading:<br />hxxp://bitcoinmagazine.net/block-reward-halving-a-guide/

				Well, no immediate big jump as the reward is halved. It&#039;s gone moderately upwards though.<br />As a casual miner, it is quite frustrating to all of a sudden get half as much reward as costs (electricity) remain the same or go up.<br />If asic hardware ever makes it&#039;s way into peoples hands, that will certainly add another level of difficulty.

				It was below $10 not long ago and today avg. is $12.40 as I write this.&nbsp; I will take 12.4% +/=&nbsp; appreciation in two months.&nbsp; I project around $15 by the first of the year as people begin to not only realize this time has come and we see a nice bounce to the upside.<br /><br />Luv<br />PG

				So what do people think 1 BTC will be worth in 1 week or 1 month?<br /><br />Still around $12 USD or potential for major shifts downwards or upwards?
