				Hey, SR Admins and Corporate members,<br /><br />Is it possible to send out alerts in the event of tainted or dangerous drugs? Dangerous, as in attacks against users, like serial killers, terrorists, etc. <br /><br />How would such a strategem work? User responses... or medical emergencies... This is a tough one.<br /><br />Take, for instance, the recent outbreak of fungus in spinal fluid all over America. 47 dead? Something like that. It took them a while to figure out what the fuck was happening. With an anonymous marketplace and illicit materials, this is a public health nightmare. If a biological weapon, similar to that in 28 Days, is ever developed, then SR would be the ideal deployment option.<br /><br />This is a national security issue, also. I&#039;ve mentioned in the Drug Safety Discussion Board about testing drugs from vendors on SR, including photos of the goods and laboratory testing. As I further considered this service, I realize that it is going to be expensive--especially to purchase my own GC or UV-Vis.... because there are SO MANY RCs and synthetic compounds available now (JWH, AM###, etc... benzos, amines, halogenated shit). It&#039;s almost tempted me to contact Department of Health and other public health groups to protect users... like when cities with high rates of heroin use and HIV/AIDS start handing out clean needles.<br /><br />Anyway, are there any plans in place that might prevent a massive disaster? I appreciate the anonymous service, but these kinds of things eat away at me. As insane as I am most of the time, these saner moments drive me crazy.&nbsp; :o

				there are government run labs in countries like NL that will test drugs anonymously mailed to them for free and post the results. The problem is getting samples to them in an anonymous way that prevents vendors from manipulating the system. Perhaps a fund could be established , and random people selected to make purchases from vendors in a random fashion, and in return for them sending samples in for testing, they get to keep the rest of the (small) order. Then when the lab results are back they can post them here for everybody. It would also be nice if people here reagent test their orders and post the results here, but more sensitive testing is required for the best safety.

				I think we would need a red alert system for this scenario, but it would be extremely difficult unless Scout or DPR or SSBD <br />agreed and worked towards it.<br /><br />a code red should also be possible if SR were to get busted, not like some vendors or buyers go down <br />i mean like if it all hits the fan. it probably wouldnt be on major news because they wouldnt want people who dont know about it <br />to go find BMR or ATL or other places to pop up...<br /><br />This should be taken into serious consideration.

				A solution for individuals would be to buy at-home testing kits. For MDMA/MDA (and most other common drugs) you can get kits from dancesafe if you are in the us or EZ test if you&#039;re in europe. <br /><br />Know your substance&#039;s chemical properties. Knowing physical properties: texture, how it looks, smells, tastes; if you want to get more advanced: flame test, melting point, pk, etc.<br /><br />There should be a vendor on SR that sells these...hmmm makes me wonder if I should put up a few of mine<br /><br />check out erowid&#039;s link on test kits:<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml#long

				Security analysts, whether CIA or Homeland Security or FBI or IRS or &lt;endless string of authority&gt;, are required by both their job description and their ideology to read these posts. Prosecuting attorneys probably spend some of their time trolling for rare thoughts to gain better profiles or each and every one of us. Do you see the level of PsyWar in which we&#039;re now competing? Open your eyes to what&#039;s really going on... but don&#039;t stop opening them. Just as Tor has many layers of routing encryption, life has infinitely more complex layers.<br /><br />A lot of what we say and do is input for intelligent computer programs. The output depends on the human aspect of programming. It is much easier to search for explosives--and the list of nitrogen compounds or chemical terms essential for securing and manufacturing--and drugs and destabilization (threats to national security). Before the computer program can perform an intelligent search, a human has to read these messages. They have to understand how we think and perform in forums. <br /><br />If you compare this forum with that of a woodworking forum or gardening forum, you will see that the dynamics do not vary much. There is always a social group that will develop a kind of leadership. The more knowledgeable members stand out, earning respect for their wisdom, and demonstrating leadership. What is different about this forum, is it contains members of organized crime--although through Rothbardism&nbsp; and not through blood rites or cultural traditions. The crime organization is Anonymous: anonymous criminals that are evading taxes and conducting illegal businesses. For certain authorities, we are enemies of the state. When you realize the level of complexity you are dealing with when you operate on the Silk Road, then you will realize what is at stake. <br /><br />There is much more than profits or personal freedom at stake. It is liberty for one and justice for all. I am speaking not only to Americans, but to every red blooded human alive and well--able to think and do for those less fortunate than ourselves.<br /><br />I have stirred up a lot shit and come off as a bottom feeder to some intelligent members here, community members, long-timers. The point I have been trying to make is about how we learn. We learn from mistakes. Mistakes are what teach us the most about a situation. &quot;Don&#039;t talk to the Cops&quot; tells us not to divulge information beyond who we are (personal identification) so that there will not be any incriminating evidence against our individual identity. If you cannot be linked back to this website, then there is certainly more freedom in what we say and do here.<br /><br />So, one thing I might suggest is to begin thinking more like a prosecutor, more like an investigator. What would it take to stop Silk Road? What would it take to put every bad mother fucking vendor in prison? In a cage? Dank and dark, so spoiled with disease that no one will ever survive....<br /><br />If we are all portrayed as enemies of the state, somehow different from a law abiding human demographic, then it will be easier for Silk Road to be taken down in the inevitable event of capture... Remember, however, that even if the servers are captured, or even a single vendor, that through the pirate lifestyle of the Silk Road--deleting messages, using GPG for EVERY COMMUNICATION that might reveal personal identity, and generally staying on top of the game (THIS Human-Computer-Human GAME)--there are limits to authoritarian power. We have invested time into securing our personal identity and personal liberty, but there are deeper mechanisms at work here. When you realize that, then you will see how revolutionary the Silk Road and BTC is becoming.<br /><br />Enemies of the State, like bin Laden... That&#039;s a scary classification. To clever investigators and politicians, that is an accurate and legal title to hand out to anyone on the Silk Road. The title is also very accurate in light of our technological advancements in criminal techniques--and it will remain criminal until Americans (or any culture) get educated about how crime works... because it is either too profitable for LE to change the current model of ignorance and enforcement or it is too expensive (personally or organizationally) to get over the learning curve. Open Source never sounded so dangerous, but that&#039;s what it is. It has created a stumbling block for national security.<br /><br />America now faces a possible war with North Korea. One thing America is good at when it comes to war is propaganda. Imagine the possibility of the Obama Administration, and/or the next administration(s), begin to cash in on the black market that is the Silk Road. I&#039;ve mentioned in another post about the price of cocaine and its relation to security with regard to the War on Drugs. It is too profitable for the outright and immediate legalization of drugs for politicians and LE commissioners to adopt and amend. Crime warlord of Mexico and Colombia exist because America keeps the price so high... a 5000% increase in value due to trafficking risk as compared to production and actual fuel costs.... sometimes more.<br /><br />Do you see how the true enemies of the state are revealed when we observe more and more information? This is the information that prosecutors and investigators are not paid to think about. Their only mission and task is to catch bad guys, not think about Right and Wrong. They are foot soldiers in a War on Drugs, fodder for the machine that is Corruption.<br /><br />If you want to sidestep the label of Enemy of the State, then you need to invest your time and money in education and personal security. That is the first step in changing America for the best. The second critical step to surviving in a hostile market is to avoid being physically hostile. ALWAYS use nonviolent means to acquire your personal wealth.

				I&#039;ve said all along that SR is a big experiment have I not anyone of these vendors to get contacted by devils saying oh put a little of this in each packet you send let us know the addresses their sent too so we can watch them and we&#039;ll put 200k into your account by morning and not arrest you if you agree, do you honestly think these vendor scum won&#039;t be tripping up at the race to be the first one to get it ha come on man and those of you saying oh theres ways around it with drug testing kits bullshit cos drug testing kits only test what it&#039;s looking for in that drug ie if cokes got poison in it it&#039;s not gonna tell you cos the test ain&#039;t looking for poisons full stop you digg anyway this comes back to my main point yet again who the fuck is this DPR character ha seroiusly man for real I&#039;ve had my suspicions but I&#039;m starting to think logically now and all what I&#039;ve said could really be man for real just imagine they really did find out that 5 years down the line that this so called DPR was a grandson of one of hitlers goons trying to get his own back on the world or if he was simply being paid by the cia and mi5 to get rid of people like you and me ha you know the 500million population mark engraved in stone etc et<br />boy I best not go on I might start to get people thinking just a few thoughts though what could really well be possibly happening and we wouldn&#039;t have a fucking clue, peace.

Or is it a self-bump when the OP does it. An over-inflated ego-bump. Bump of Ego--BoE?<br /><br />Anyway, if we are going to claim sophistication in anyway, then we have to be focused on survival. My rant for the evening: American Revolution. AR was a fight against tyranny be educated white men. It was a different time--but not much different. Now, any man of any race can be educated, women too. The power struggle has not ended. It shouldn&#039;t end at the Road, either.<br /><br />Fellow humans, don&#039;t wait for a superior (whether alien or GMO) species to threaten our existence to work toward survival. Get educated, and fight not for world peace--that is thermodynamically impossible--but instead for technological and biological evolution.... which presents the paradox of the superior GMO species. It is an evolutionary intelligence paradox.<br /><br />Every writer/creator of Sci-Fi and every child at one point looks up at the sky and wonders about alien life. SETI is designed to do just that. What happens when we create more intelligent life? That life may feel threatened by lesser mortals, naturally. I am convinced we should kill every poisonous species on Earth (starting with Australia!) in order to protect and preserve human life, but that&#039;s just me. We are the most dangerous game. Let&#039;s keep it that way.<br /><br />War is what will keep us together. War is peace. There will always be Good and Bad. Someone will always think something is good, and there will always be someone that thinks that same thing is bad. Get with the program and make your Good more sustainable and more sophisticated. Don&#039;t drink water from lead drinking pipes (Rome). Don&#039;t expand beyond control (Rome, Britain, Ottoman, etc.).<br /><br />
