And operating out in the open to give the appearance of legitimacy certainly didn&#039;t help them when the feds pwnt them.

				This is Web Tryp 2.0. Clearnet vendors based in any Western European or North American countries must have known the current business model could only last for so long. Posting fucking DOX and 2C-X&#039;s to anyone in any country just &#039;cos you&#039;ve got a little disclaimer such as:<br /><br />&quot;If you use Credit Card this compound cannot be ship to: USA,&nbsp; &nbsp;Israel, Sweden, UK for more info look at our SHIPPING RESTRCTION&quot;. From one well known vendor. But from a legal perspective, they may as well be selling MDXX with the same caveat. Low hanging fruit indeed, Silk Road can wait a little longer...<br /><br />The industry adapts though and will always circumvent any attempts by LE of bringing it under control, demonstrating the utter futility of prohibition of these compounds. Look at how the market has evolved since Web Tryp in 2004, there must be near 100 new compounds which have become readily available since then. I wonder what state it&#039;ll be in in another 8 years?

				People who don&#039;t use security measures will always end up busted, this shit happens in cycles an after every cycle more people start being secure. But after the smoke clears there is always a new batch of retards who think they can use the old techniques that have already been proven as pwnable, that&#039;s why we see places like TFM using hushmail even after they already cooperated with the feds against other online drug dealers. Prior to raw deal a LOT of people used hushmail, after raw deal a lot of people switched to GPG and the ones who didn&#039;t were busted, no surprise there.

				I keep hearing about this WebTryp thing so I did a bit of digging and researched it and then I looked at what people seem to be calling Armageddon and I have got to say I agree with Wowzer. How the FUCK do you expect to be able to survive by doing this shit on the clearweb? The whole thing is just is just a massive balls-up from start to finish. As if any bacon flavoured individual, let alone full on gammon-based organisation is going to listen to a disclaimer which is just a transparent flat out lie and they used traceable payment methods like CC processors and I.D-required money transfers.<br /><br />I also had a look at that place The Farmers Market as well and what happened there as well. They were selling illegals with the same purchasing methods. <br /><br />Don&#039;t want to sound like a cunt here but this is just a huge case of &quot;Come on....really?....REALLLLYYY?&quot;<br /><br />Seems to me that this is what SR was built for. Use the clearnet to sell drugs - you get fucked. Use the darkweb - safer. Use CC processors, I.D based money transfers - you get fucked. Use BTC and then learn how to wash them properly and store the proceeds in a safe place - much more safe. <br /><br />Anyone see what I am saying here?

				It was good while it lasted.&nbsp; Remembering operation web tryp, I knew the gravy train would stop eventually.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be honest - I used my credit card every time.&nbsp; The prices were way cheaper and the process way more convenient than SR.&nbsp; As a customer who bought legal products in small amounts, I&#039;m really not concerned.&nbsp; Just like SR, it&#039;s not the customers who get in trouble with LE, it&#039;s the sellers.

				Unlike with SR it isn&#039;t illegal to possess consume or do what-ever-the-fuck you want with analog research chemicals, it is only illegal to sell them marketed for human consumption (in webtryp they showed such evidence as the email addresses of customers...things like lol_shroom_all_the_time@drugs.com and Inject2c-intomyeyeball@research-chemicals-are-fun-to-sniff.com ... to show that even though the companies had not for human consumption disclaimers, they knew they were selling to people who would consume the products. If they had been more strict about their policies they would have probably gotten away with it).

But this adds on to what I am saying in a way. Check this analogy because it makes the point better.<br /><br />People that own clubs, in particular ones that own clubs that host raves know that the drug scene is a large contributing factor to the scene. They can&#039;t run away from it but they can&#039;t be seen to be in it&#039;s pocket either. So the best policy is to meet them half way and let the party people do what they are going to do but so long as it&#039;s nice and discreet. On the flip side of this though, if someone cracks out the bing and starts doing lines off the bar....they gotta go and you may have to call the rozzers. By having this balanced and fair approach you get your party people in your establishment and at the same time, you satisfy the law that you are keeping your hands clean. <br /><br />Now take that theory and fit it to what has happened here. &quot;Not for human consumption&quot; and yet these kids have been talking about taking their drugs openly on the clear net and now they have had their markets and apparently some of their dealers/vendors/sellers whatever taken away. That&#039;s because by having these silly open conversations, that can be viewed by anyone, having silly named emails, doing whatever is basically the same as being in a club and doing lines in front of the bouncers. They had their sweet spot, pushed it, and now they fucked it. If they had just done the equivalent of nipping off and racking up in the toilet or down a back alley they would be cool....but they didn&#039;t....twice now apparently....in less than a decade. <br /><br />Like one of the posters said above he remembers the first sweep because it wasn&#039;t long ago. It&#039;s not like we are talking about Neo-Nazis who are into white supremacy but weren&#039;t even a glint in the milkman&#039;s eye during World War two, this shit happened a few years ago.

				I think the rise of the RC scene has LE in the USA feeling like they have lost what little control they thought they had.&nbsp; They have been trying, unsuccessfully so far, to get laws passed that they think they need to control it.&nbsp; Without new laws, I think we can expect to see LE enforcing existing laws more creatively and aggressively.&nbsp; After 9/11, we all watched as the U.S. government re-interpreted existing law to make legal certain forms of torture, i.e. waterboarding.&nbsp; So perhaps we can expect a re-interpretation of the analog laws such that the government can charge/prosecute even when they can&#039;t prove the chemicals are intended for human consumption.&nbsp; In any event, I think we can expect to see the U.S. government enforcing the analog laws much more aggressively.<br /><br />RCs are just another front on the war on drugs.&nbsp; The war on cocaine, marijuana and heroin is completely out of control with Mexico in shambles.&nbsp; With the sheer number of RCs, and more everyday, eventually even the government will recognize the futility of the war on drugs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect that to happen anytime soon, unfortunately.<br /><br />Keep safe everyone, and look out for each other for fucks sake.
