				did i miss the thread where people are talking about this?&nbsp; it was front page news on BBC this morning...go look it up if you haven&#039;t heard.<br /><br />some fear mongering writers are saying this means bitcoin could be next.&nbsp; i can&#039;t imagine they could stop bitcoin, but i imagine they could go to great lengths to make it nearly impossible to buy and sell them online.<br /><br />thoughts?

				Yeah big thread already started in this forum(first page) if I&#039;m not mistaken. Personally I think for them(Government) they are going to feel like today was a big win for them. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll all go out for beers after and smack each others asses. I may be weird when I say this but I think everytime like this happens it&#039;s a great time to expand our resources and the way we do things. If we look at the whole of Silk Road and BitCoin the glaring weakness is the cashing out aspect. I&#039;ve been sitting and wondering how could someone make a de-centralized banking entity. I have a theories but they&#039;re way off and probably not possible.

				It is a slippery slope, man. The US government has an extreme hatred for everything that is not the dollar. Notice how the CND and the Euro&#039;s value get closed to the USD&#039;s every day? Fortunately they cannot stop bitcoin, even if they wanted to.

				Wow they are only two or three years behind the latest trends, maybe in three more years when we are using NextCoin they will shut down Bitcoin somehow.

				Seriously feds, pretty consistent pattern. I can tell what you are going to go after next, because it is what I was using three years ago. It is weird, like you are always trying to catch up almost lol.

Shutting Bitcoin down will be like playing whack a mole. They might shut down an exchanger here or there, and then new ones will pop up. But the actual currency will not be shut down, and it is consistent across any new exchangers. LR getting shut down means that the money in LR is gone in a poof, a Bitcoin exchanger being shut down means that it is time for another one to pop up.
