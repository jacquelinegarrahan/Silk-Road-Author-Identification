				Last week, I suddenly, wasn&#039;t able to log in and it was weird because I log in on a daily basis.<br />After a couple of days, I opened a new account and proved to SR support that it&#039;s me, they reset my password and then, when I logged in, I noticed that my funds were withdrawn at one of the days that I couldn&#039;t log in.<br />I neither opened an Atlantis account with the exact same details nor logged in to a fake SR address nor downloaded any new program or plugin to TOR.<br /><br />Today, I noticed that user &quot;dirkpitt&quot; was also a victim of this hacker.<br />(<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209244.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209263.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209267.0<br />)<br /><br /><br />SO, I think we have a very smart professional hacker that is stealing our money.<br /><br />It is a very serious Security breach and I will be glad if SR staff could investigate this issue.<br /><br /><br />If anyone has experienced such incident he is more than invited to report about it.<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br />BPM

				You were phished, I must see a dozen people a week posting on the forums having fallen victim to a phishing scam. The only way your funds can be withdrawn is by using your PIN, most people falling for these scams at the moment have opened up accounts on Atlantis via a phishing link using the same credentials as their SR account.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t do that you should as astor said check your computer for malware, rootkits, keyloggers etc. If you have any of those on your machine you will need to do a HD format and reinstall the OS, they are nearly impossible to remove any other way.

				@ChemCat, OK let&#039;s say that I mistakenly, logged in to a phishing, fake SR address. How could they possibly discover my PIN code to withdraw all of my funds?? It doesn&#039;t make any sense...<br /><br />I admit, my password wasn&#039;t so strong nor my PIN code, but it&#039;s still doesn&#039;t explain that.<br /><br /><br />@astor and samesamebutdifferent, yes, I did purchased something with my PIN of course but what can you assume from that?&nbsp; &nbsp;and my computer is super clean and protected. I&#039;m a programmer so I know one thing or two about computers, always with updated antivirus+firewall and I know every *.exe program that runs any second on my computer.<br />Also, as I said, although I opened an Atlantis account, I wasn&#039;t so stupid to use the exact same details as on SR.<br /><br /><br /><br />@Kiwikiikii, I hope that you are right and I&#039;m stupid and all of this is just a coincidence instead of a smart hacker attack!!!&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I got a weird automated message from SR staff while I wasn&#039;t able to log in: <br />Subject : &quot;Discussion privledges suspended&quot;<br />&quot;<br />Your discussion privledges have been suspended for 1000 day(s) because of the following post:<br /><br />Silk Road&#38;#039;s #1 Alternative: http://[CENSORED: scam link].onion/<br /><br />Please use a polite tone and stay on topic when posting next time.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br /><br />NOTE: This is an automated message. Replies will not be answered<br />&quot;<br /><br /><br />I have no idea what this message means ?????

				What are you doing with BTC left in your account! You should rarely have a balance unless you plan on purchasing something at that exact moment. SR is not very stable and could go down at anytime. You should a permanent btc wallet that you transfer your funds to.

				I got an error after logging in about 2 days ago - figured it was just due to maintenance or something like that. I&#039;m quite sure that i was on the correct domain since i have it bookmarked which would rule out a typo or clicking on a link somewhere else that resembles the SR url. <br /><br />I don&#039;t keep much in my SR BTC wallet, but as far as i can tell there is nothing missing either.<br /><br />So just to confirm things: has there been some problem on the real SR that caused an error message to display after trying to login? I do not recall the exact error message, but it was something pretty generic and did not mention anything about a wrong password or something wrong with my account.

				Hi <br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know anything about the OP. <br />&nbsp;I just wanted to say, I have read several of JohntheBaptits, over the couple of months he has been here, I have not read a single positive post from him, and he seems like the sort of person you don&#039;t want to know. That is putting it nicely. No need for such a nasty comment, true or not. WE don&#039;t need people like him here. <br />C<br />
