				Another German Thread about this story ...<br /><br />http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,828039,00.html<br /><br />Translation:<br />Also the use of the camouflage technology gate protected eight operators of a commercial platform for unlawful drugs not against the access of the US justice. After on-line shops with customers all over the world lifelong prison sentences could come up to the defendants.<br /><br />They had hidden so well. With the help of the TOR Hidden Service gate a group of eight drug dealers veiled her identity and organized under the name &#039; The Farmer&#039;s Market &#039; lucrative trade with various narcotics like LSD and ecstasy. Between January, 2007 and October, 2009 they served according to the accusation more than 5200 orders to the value of more than a million dollars. More than 3000 names from 35 lands were on the customer list. Besides, the operators offered a polished customer management, including on-line forums, Internet orders, customer care and at least four different possibilities for the payment, under it also to PayPal.<br /><br />Investigators of anti-drug authority DEA got onto the drug dealers in the course of a two-year-old action called &#039; operation of Adam Bomb &#039;. Although the suspects tried to be hidden by the use of the gate project and also used other possibilities for the IP-Anonymisierung, the officials succeeded in tracing back her e-mail traffic up to 2006. In which way the authorities went forward, besides, nevertheless, it does not arise from the 66-asided plaint presented on Monday specifically. Among the rest, the gate project also counts as important tools for the protection of dissidents who want to use unnoticeably the Internet in dictatorial states.<br /><br />The collaboration of officials from several lands, under it Colombia, the Netherlands and Scotland also led to the arrest of the defendants now. The prime suspect was arrested on Monday in the Dutch Lelystad. Already on Sunday the handcuffs clicked for an American with the attempt to leave from Colombia. The remaining ones were settled in different US federal states.<br /><br />In the accusation conspiracy is accused of eight men to drug trafficking and monetary laundry. In case of a conviction each of them must count on a lifelong prison sentence.<br /><br />Gladly about the success explained the inquiry leader: &#039; The today&#039;s action should send to the organizations which use technology on the realization of criminal activities the clear message that the DEA and other criminal proceedings authorities will track down them and bring in court. &#039;

				Wow.. I am very surprised to hear about this. To any TFM vendor who could possibly be roaming our forums, I wish you well. This is another case of why GPG should be used though. Pretty sure their communication and order forms were not encrypted. TOR by itself isn&#039;t cutting it anymore ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I would expect there is an ongoing operation to remove this site as well. Seriously, step up your security measures.
