				Alright, so I&#039;ve been on SR since May, and thus far I have been scammed twice by Smilebit and funinapackage. However, let me say this.<br /><br />WHEN IT SAYS (ESPECIALLY THE HIDDEN WIKI) ON THE LOG-IN PAGE, THEY MEAN IT. <br /><br />I WAS FUCKING STUPID AND PUT IN MY INFO FROM THE HIDDEN WIKI LINK (I EVEN NOTICED THE ADDRESS WAS FUCKING DIFFERENT) AND WITHIN 5 FUCKING MINUTES ALL MY MONEY WAS GONE.<br /><br />Yes, I have changed my password.<br /><br />FUCK. I am so fucking pissed at myself. <br /><br />Don&#039;t make the same mistake and always make sure that when you log in it is from the address that starts with ian......ulzz.onion.<br /><br />FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.<br /><br />

				Yes, we have to be extra careful.&nbsp; We are a known entity now, and the word is out, as we seem to get repeatedly, both by social engineering thieves, as the various bitcoin ripoffs have done, and by phishing...the thing that saves me is keepassx...I keep my url&#039;s, usernames, and passwords in keepassx, and now in Tails, with updates, keepassx is available, so I just boot tails, and get keepassx along with anything else Tails needs...keep my pswds in an encrypted file handy, either in cloud or on a flash drive...<br /><br />But mostly we count on people to help out, and to protect the newbies.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for posting this, as it will save others having to go thru the same thing...

				Ah man, really sorry to hear about that.&nbsp; I think all to myself I have made five different comments in the past couple of weeks to people who mention hidden wiki to STAY AWAY.<br /><br />copy the actual SR url into a notepad file, throw it on an encrypted flash drive.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; You can also save it in your list of Tor services if you wish, although you may have questions if your PC is ever siezed lol.
