				I am aware of the supposedly pseudo-random operation of the SR Bitcoin tumbler but my question is - what sort of audit trail does the tumbler produce and is the audit trail purged periodically? I would assume it has to retain some accountability in the event of a problem. If we assume that the tumbler application(s) were operating on one of the seized servers what impact, if any, is that going to have on wallet/coin anonymity?<br /><br />Obviously the blockchain is public, but if an attacker had a reasonable log of the tumblers machinations then it is possible that some end to end coin flows could be deduced.<br /><br />Coins are not really my thing but it would seem advisable to get a new wallet or two and move coins out of existing wallets through and into new wallets. I would very much like to hear from anyone with a better understanding of the tumbler to see if this advice is sensible.<br /><br /><br />

If the tumbler is still working, maybe there is still a chance that backup payouts are eventually coming.<br /><br />worth a fraction of a coin to see if it is still working.<br /><br />Someone please cross post to actual SR forums also<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				thanks mate - that address doesn&#039;t seem to have been active since April this year though so not sure if it is still in service.<br /><br />Blockchain.info do have it listed as a public SR tumbler though I note.<br /><br />I want to understand how exposed historic SR BTC transactions are to analysis given LEO access to the servers - I&#039;ve never been able to pick it apart before but that doesn&#039;t really give me much assurance as I am not well up on BTC.<br /><br />cheers again!
