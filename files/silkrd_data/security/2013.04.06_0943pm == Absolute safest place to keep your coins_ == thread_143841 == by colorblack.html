				So, what would be the safest place to keep coins? Obviously I know SR is rock solid and safe. I trust it more then Bitfloor for sure.

				blockchain.info is pretty safe as long you use the browser extension and keep a local backup of your wallet. I never bothered to install Bitcoin-QT, am I missing out?

				paper wallets! Blockchain has a paper wallet option where you can generate a wallet, print out the addy and private key, then delete the keys from it so you can only view the address.. Any time you want to send funds from the addy, you will need to import the wallet into something and then you can send them or cash out. It&#039;s the most secure way to store your coins

I do not know the topology of the system well enough to determine what is stored and what is not, what is sniffable and what is not. However it seems that in application of our normal technology, transfering coins from your SR account to your local wallet and then out would all be traceable. <br /><br />Thoughts please?

				storing it on your computer is going to be the best thing to do.. have an encrypted partition on your harddrive and run your client from there.<br /><br />plus the whole range of other rpoceedures you can find on here and the clearnet&nbsp; about protecting your coin from hackers etc,<br /><br />but what you really want to be doing is trying to find yourself a way to turn the damn bitcoins back into real money and then you can go and buy yourself a big drum and bury it etc..<br /><br />or think of some way to launder it..<br /><br />it seems nice to hold onto coins but im off the idea now because the damn coins could just die.. or the governments of the world may be able to fuck you up.. or maybe the banks will screw it up.. <br /><br />in the meantime i think its just better to keep it safe as others here suggested----&nbsp; but the key is getting it back into cash you can spend as a priority. id rather get that money laundered and pay tax on it under a fake business than have all that time and effort just go into thin air if something happens to the coins or it gets harder to change back into fiat.<br /><br />if i had a million dollars id feel like a million bucks.. but if i was a bitcoin millionare id need anti-anxiety medication.

If you trust tor. If you don&#039;t you&#039;d do the same, but use macchanger and a random public wifi hotspot or something like that...
