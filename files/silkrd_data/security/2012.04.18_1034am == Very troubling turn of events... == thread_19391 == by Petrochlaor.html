				Hey hey people,<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d make a post on here because a recent turn of events that have occurred just over the past day or so, and have left might quite disturbed.<br /><br />A friend of mine used Silk Road like I did, and yesterday at around 11pm his house was raided by the police. This is UK by the way.<br /><br />Specifically he was found with a lot of wraps of MDMA (his fault, honestly), and had a missing order of pills from Aakoven. I thought I&#039;d alert people to the fact that Aakoven&#039;s packaging, from another friend&#039;s experience, is rather poor, and the fact that my friend had to have his pills resent was disturbing, though I believe a deal of that was his fault, as I believe he failed to encrypt his details.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t an attack on anyone, this is simply a warning, again about how vital security is, and that although I was quite lax before (mainly a weed buyer, you see), I am now taking further steps to increase my security, as (in hindsight) I should have before. Please, fellow Roaders, this turn of events did occur and is very troubling, especially when it happens to a friend. <br /><br />I wish you all safety and good-times on the Road, but the police are starting to wise-up. Specifically, they requested that my friend hand over his SR account details so that they may use it, although I don&#039;t know the name currently, as soon as I get the details I&#039;ll post them as a warning to vendors, in case they attempt to use it to make a purchase. <br /><br />Again, deeply saddening and troubling events, and I suppose this is a wake up call for me, and I thought it best that I warn others of the predicament.<br /><br />Regards, Petrochlaor

				Your friend sounds very very very very very lax if there was enough evidence that the Police could out any pressure on him to admit anything at all<br /><br />If you actually know what you are doing, the police will leave any attempted house raid with NO EVIDENCE<br /><br /><br /><br />Allow me to repeat: A message to the Law Enforcement authorities in my country<br /><br /><br />Come and raid my house. Now. You will find nothing. No evidence whatsoever. I will make all the Law Enforcement officers that attend the address my full co-operation in not incriminating myself, and will provide refreshments to all Officers if I am allowed to, as it could take quite some time to confirm that there is no evidence of me committing a crime.&nbsp; <br /><br />Come tomorrow, and the next day. Any day you like. I&#039;m ready for you.

				Oh of course, I accept that wholly. He&#039;d ever wrapped his mandy into wraps, which was moronic of him.<br /><br />I just thought I&#039;d point out, for the billionth time, that the threat is very real. That was my point.<br /><br />That was all.

				I think knowing the amounts ordered is very important here. As well as details of the warrant. <br /><br />I doubt it has anything to do with lack of encryption.

				I also know of a first hand IRL experience of a raid by federal agents done because of a raiding of aakovens packaging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Order was for 100x pills.&nbsp; Although I thought his packaging has been stepped up by then.

				He had 4 grams, but like I said, wrapped up into baggies.<br /><br />The police officially told him the reason they got a warrant to check was because of poorly packaged pills, in this case by Aakoven. I was at first worried that he&#039;d done poor encryption, but no, I suppose it was entirely down to poor packaging. That&#039;s really sad, to be honest.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19391.msg195631#msg195631">Quote from: Holly on April 18, 2012, 03:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I also know of a first hand IRL experience of a raid by federal agents done because of a raiding of aakovens packaging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Order was for 100x pills.&nbsp; Although I thought his packaging has been stepped up by then.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for that info, Holly :) I was hoping that someone else had experience with him.

				So correct my logic if it&#039;s wrong but, as long as packages keep showing up with the contents inside them, you should have very little to worry about.&nbsp; Everyone always says the biggest mistake happens in the shipping process.&nbsp; Oh, and don&#039;t order from the fucking netherlands!

				Buddy first thing is if the cops said they caught him cause of poor packaging then rest assured&nbsp; they popped him for a different reason. The only thing you can be certain of is&nbsp; whatever COPS ADMIT TO as far as how they caught&nbsp; you is a LIE. They are like poker players&nbsp; if they give you any hint at all on purpose what their hand is they are doing it for a reason trying to be deceptive. I am a new member on Silk and currently waiting for support to reset my pin. I forgot it.&nbsp; bah!&nbsp; What i get for trying to remember something with my brain. haha.&nbsp; anyways yeah I feel lucky to be a part of the community and its probably going to be a game of hot potato or&nbsp; when you run around the chairs till someone yells and everyone sits down real fast and one person is left out.&nbsp; its going to get to where this place or a site like it will be&nbsp; restricted to known and current members only&nbsp; &nbsp;the bigger something gets and gains notoriety when its for&nbsp; goods like this its just a matter of time before it disappears and the government shuts it down&nbsp; so there might come a time where the powers to be here&nbsp; make this a closed society. So I look forward to getting to know some venders and&nbsp; having a healthy and trusting (though no matter how much we like and or get along with someone here trust should go only so far) business relationship. if and when its ever restricted to current members only it may cut profits for venders but&nbsp; greed is what causes most peoples down fall and for us&nbsp; users we should be happy and thankfull same as the venders and none of us&nbsp; keep wanting more and more.

				This whole story, if true, actually just goes to show how unlikely you are to be arrested for buying from the Silk Road. Let&#039;s look at the number of factors that had to go against your friend.<br /><br />1) He purchased from the Netherlands. Already he&#039;s making a big mistake. The Netherlands are an automatic red alert to customs officials. Do not buy from there! You don&#039;t necessarily have to buy domestic every time, but you better be Dutch if you&#039;re ordering from them.<br /><br />2) The packaging was apparently bad. The package was probably marked as suspicious because it was from the Netherlands, and it took a very simple search to discover the pills. This one is on the vendor. Make sure you deal with vendors that know how to package properly!<br /><br />3) Your friend had drugs lying around his place. This is so, so stupid. Ladies and gentlemen, you do not have drugs lying out in the open in your house. Ever. You have a stash secluded somewhere that LE wouldn&#039;t think to look. It&#039;s unlikely enough that you&#039;ll be visited, but you&#039;re really not doing yourself any favors if when they show up they have all the evidence right in front of them.<br /><br />4) He immediately spilled the beans about the Silk Road when questioned. What a foolish move. Do not say a WORD to the police! You have the right to remain silent. Use it! Don&#039;t talk to anyone except a lawyer! Why would you confess so easily like that?<br /><br />So would you look at that, 4 dumb things had to occur simultaneously for this bust to happen. Don&#039;t let these happen to you and you can travel the Road successfully like the rest of us. Don&#039;t get cocky about your security. If you make it easy for LE to get you, they will. It&#039;s not rocket science people.

OP your posts dont make sense. in your first post you said<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I wish you all safety and good-times on the Road, but the police are starting to wise-up. Specifically, they requested that my friend hand over his SR account details so that they may use it, although I don&#039;t know the name currently, as soon as I get the details I&#039;ll post them as a warning to vendors, in case they attempt to use it to make a purchase. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />then in your second post you say<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">In fact, something else weird. My friend (for whatever reason) handed over all his Silk Road details and everything, but these cops didn&#039;t actually seem to realise what it was, and were quite amazed. So although perhaps the higher-ups know about it, the street-level guys don&#039;t seem to know/care, at least in the UK. So I suppose that&#039;s good news, at least.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so during the raid the cops asked for his SR details (indicating he was using SR, and they had knowledge of this... he then handed his details over to the pigs,&nbsp; but as per your second post you say they had no idea about SR, and were quite amazed about it.... <br /><br />my question is, are the cops that stupid they will ask your mate for his SR details, then when he gives them, they play dumb and pretend not to know about SR?<br /><br /><br />pfffffffffft<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry buddy, I should of phrased it better. At the time was probably still a tad angry, you know?<br /><br />Right, so situation was they came into his house, he just owned up to everything, including SR. They didn&#039;t inquire, they weren&#039;t there for that, they were there for their warrant to search for drugs.<br /><br />He told them all about silk road, and then they asked him to hand over the details. They never once mentioned SR before he mentioned it. So he was trying to avoid trouble, I guess. But he&#039;s told me that looking back he wished he hadn&#039;t mentioned it, feels a bit of a dick.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t mean for any confusion, was a bit unclear I admit. Feel free to ask whatever, and I&#039;ll answer if I can.<br /><br />Right now he&#039;s on bail, and yes, most of the problem was his own (leaving wrapped mdma around, for example), but he didn&#039;t expect to get caught, because he didn&#039;t expect a top seller&#039;s packaging to be so poor. I&#039;m not paranoid, and I think the police were being honest about the whole situation, and that they literally were just following up an intercepted drug shipment, for whatever reason (maybe other dealers nearby had done similar things? I don&#039;t know).<br /><br />But yeah, hope that clears some things up.

Not his fault there was bad packaging, was his fault that he&#039;d left his MDMA around. But well, live and learn.

				How old are you and your &#039;friends&#039;? Maybe you shouldn&#039;t be here at all, reading your posts it seems you all have a habit of getting caught. Voluntarily handing over all his account details and giving the plod a guided tour of this place? Really? Im honestly lost for words at that. What did you say earlier in the thread? It&#039;s good news that the pigs had no idea about this place? Haha yep great news<br /><br />What&#039;s your friends account name? You need to let the community know. I mean you have publicly named the vendor, which now puts vendor and customers at risk, why not your &#039;friend&#039;?<br /><br />I had 50 pills stopped at customs last year and the police didn&#039;t follow up, to get a warrant over 5 they must have been having a slow week. I think there&#039;s more to this than your telling us or like many have said it&#039;s a tall tale.

				It is so frustrating with aakoven because he has great product, but he is too lazy and a liability. He won&#039;t use encryption properly and his packs are seriously shoddy these days. I understand he is busy but personally I would rather wait a little longer for a well packaged delivery than have a piece of shit rushed out to me. It&#039;s only a matter of time before this causes someone a serious problem. It would be nice to see him come on here and give some assurance that he is going to step up his game.

But not his details, I don&#039;t think. Silly, I know, but I don&#039;t think he expected to get bust, because previously we&#039;d experienced a lot of good packaging and so forth.

				A small amount like this would get a customs letter if it was stopped at customs, but if it was detected after customs the post office call the police. Different police forces have different priorities but I know a guy got busted in Cornwall because a package (not from SR) got damaged, drugs were found (amphet, i think 1/4oz), and the police got a warrant on the strength of it. His house was clean and he wasn&#039;t charged with anything but it still shows the police can get a warrant for small amounts.

				Are you kidding me? when are people going to learn not to talk to cops. This kid thought there was no harm telling them about sr and maybe they would take it easy on him in exchange for the info. But the TRUTH is not only will the police not take it easy on you, it is not even there call, it is the prosecutors decision to what you are charged with. On top of this you tell them all about sr and probably without any thought that you ordered from the Netherlands. Well guess what you just incriminated yourself for another very severe charge in most countries, and that is the receiving of drugs trafficked from OTHER nations. This charge can give you more jail time then the charge for the actual drugs themselves in most cases!!!!<br /><br />Never talk to police!!!!(PS in the United States information you state supporting your innocence when arrested is legally not admissible in court, in other words it cant help you)(PS im a criminal justice major lol, lots of my teachers have been cops, they frequently laugh really hard when they talk about how often people do not use there right to be silent, there such d bags)
