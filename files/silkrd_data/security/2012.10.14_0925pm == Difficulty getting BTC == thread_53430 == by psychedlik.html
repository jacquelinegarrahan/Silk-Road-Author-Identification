				Hello everybody! First of all, it is my first post (yes I&#039;m a &quot;fucking noob&quot; ^^ but everyone has to begin one day!) ..<br /><br />I&#039;m just having some difficulty on purchasing bitcoins (I live in france) ! Every step by step tutoriels I&#039;ve seen are for you US people, using dollars but I use euros and I really don&#039;t know how to get ANONYMOUSLY and in an UNTRACEABLE way bitcoins in FRANCE with EUROS!<br /><br />So I hope one of you should help me, and lead me to my goal....<br /><br />Thank you! <br />Peace&nbsp;

				After noob information overload finally made a decision and&nbsp; sent cash in the mail to bitcoin nordic.&nbsp; Â£GBP by recorded delivery from UK and a big dose of crossed fingers.&nbsp; I followed the tracking online - post office to sorting office to heathrow to copenhagen&nbsp; then &quot;undelivered, not at address, office closed&quot;&nbsp; oh shit, very sinking feeling, all sorts of thoughts going through my head.&nbsp; I dropped them an email, no reply, don&#039;t we just want instant replies!&nbsp; Website says they hope to reply in 24 hours. Left it for 36 and sent another message.&nbsp; Result!!&nbsp; got an apologetic reply for the delay, cash received and bitcoins in the wallet.
