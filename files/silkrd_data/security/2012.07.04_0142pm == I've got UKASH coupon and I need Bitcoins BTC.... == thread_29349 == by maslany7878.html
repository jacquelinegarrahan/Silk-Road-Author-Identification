As such surely any fool with access to the security footage could see who you were? My advice to you is to use a cash deposit via Bitinstant or look up a vendor who deals in MoneyPaks like Blueskytraders.<br /><br />V.

Moreover if you receive a package into your home containing illegal goods and later try to claim you had no knowledge there were drugs inside it, the fact that you&#039;ve purchased a digital currency used mainly for trafficking in illegal goods is not exactly going to endear a jury of your peers to you.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the only way to obtain BTC is buying them for cash or selling goods/services such as Moneypaks.<br /><br />V.
