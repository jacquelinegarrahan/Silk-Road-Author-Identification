				Just ignore that little exploit that got installed on your root. <br /><br />I hope you, at least, have a Linux distro installed.<br /><br />If all you are worried about is the content of your email, then install Thunderbird and the Enigmail extension and just use a clearnet email service. Once you get it installed and generate your keys, it&#039;s easy peasy Japaneezy. You can even have multiple email accounts and PGP/GnuPG keys in Thunderbird. Or, if you have a KDE desktop, Kmail is very similar to Thunderbird. <br /><br /><br />Or, if you want anonymity:<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t be a Petraeus: A Tutorial on Anonymous Email Accounts&quot;<br /><br />https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/tutorial-how-create-anonymous-email-accounts

				Secure email is a myth.&nbsp; &nbsp; PGP gives you security for the content of the message, if everything works right.<br /><br />But unless you&#039;re emailing another user of the same mail server, nine times out of ten, your message is getting sent out, in cleartext, over SMTP between servers.&nbsp; Where it&#039;s susceptible to being archived long-term (the US government is pretty clear that encrypted communications can be stored indefinitely) and the metadata can be stored.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who it&#039;s from, who it&#039;s to, what the subject is, what the Message-ID is, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Which lets folks build a nice web of who knows who, when they communicate, how big the messages are, etc.<br /><br />You can get cute, and use mixmaster or the like to dump a pseudononymous address to a Usenet group, where there&#039;s no easy way for them to see you picking it up.&nbsp; The bad news there?&nbsp; Your ciphertext, is sitting there, in public, forever.&nbsp; pine illustrated the relationships between PGP key IDs here a while back.&nbsp; &nbsp;Somebody presented a similar analysis at DEFCON, using those messages from Usenet.<br /><br />And most people reading this have a tolerable chance of living long enough to see some of the underlying ciphers behind PGP broken.&nbsp; &nbsp;At which point all those messages are vulnerable to attack.&nbsp; The ones from Usenet groups, the ones intercepted by government agencies, etc.&nbsp; The Venona intercepts were fascinating reading, even after all those years.&nbsp; alt.anonymous.messages will be, too.<br /><br />Email just doesn&#039;t lend itself to the level of secrecy that folks want.&nbsp; &nbsp;OTR and other technologies giving Perfect Forward Secrecy generally require a session key that you can throw away at the end of the conversation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Email requires the session key to stay around as long as the email does.&nbsp; Maybe in a few years if something like the Pond project gets traction, there will be a decent alternative.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				E-mail is inherently insecure. It&#039;s always been from the start because it was designed to be completely transparent. Therefore a new form of secure anonymous communication needs to be developed to replace e-mail for those who want it. Bitmessage is the first but there will be more.

				Many good suggestions of ideas and alternatives to Tormail. I must admit Frank, when I saw the post I said, wtf? This has to be old. <br /><br />That being said, Wadozo, ya know, ya don&#039;t just go busting the guys balls for asking a seemingly idiotic question. You&#039;re a bright guy, as I&#039;ve seen in many of your posts, and while I agree that we shouldn&#039;t even be discussing that ever cheating harlot &quot;Tormail&quot;, I think a little more tact and a little less vinegar, would make for a better experience for all. <br /><br />That program is toast Frank.

There is also the issue of using PM&#039;s. If frank wants to know details, send a PM and ask a question instead of broadcasting certain particulars over the forum in various threads. Just have a look at frank88&#039;s post history and you&#039;ll see what I mean. Some people have accused him of being a troll. I have reserved judgement on that for the time being. With that being said, his posts don&#039;t fill me with any confidence, nor does the title he chose for this Thread!

				Point taken. I&#039;m just realizing now the threads. I haven&#039;t even looked, I swear. <br /><br />Do they go something like - (Speed Thread) anyone know if Powerade ships to Australia? - different names, but like that. <br /><br />&quot;How much does Cape Crusader sell a gram for usually?&quot;<br /><br />Yeah, now I know. LoL <br /><br />Hey Frank! Where I come from, we wouldn&#039;t call you Frank, we&#039;d call you DICK! -- sorry man! Wadozo does have a point. I lurked on that speed thread from May of 2012 until the great SR outtage of Nov 2012, when I had no choice but to say something. If I pulled half the dumb questions I see on there lately, I would&#039;ve had to take the walk of shame off the boards, and maybe come back with a new moniker. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not that good at maneuvering around, you can PM some people for help, or check out the helpful sections that exist already. <br /><br />Like when you ask about a vendor with a one line question, that is something you can type the name of the vendor into the search bar. It&#039;s fickle sometimes, and you actually have to first click &quot;Search&quot; (next to Home+help). - Help yourself a little. I&#039;m always willing to help. Don&#039;t have much info on Aussie things, but they sure have a whole bunch of threads that are fired up most nights. <br /><br />Explore young man! <br /><br />As the sign in my friends shop used to say, <br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t go away mad, just go away&quot; <br /><br />(It helps to have a sense of humor+a thick skin in here too)<br /><br />Peace out people<br /><br />jagfug
