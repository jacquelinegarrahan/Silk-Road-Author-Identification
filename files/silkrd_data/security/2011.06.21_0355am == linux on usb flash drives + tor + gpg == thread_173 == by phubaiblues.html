				I know many are using virtual machines.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used virtualbox in the past, but last few days, I&#039;d been trying different distros of real bare bones linux on a flash/pen drive.&nbsp; I tried slax and puppylinux, as I&#039;m used to puppy, but had trouble, as always, getting the wireless set up...this time I tried xpud, as it&#039;s a lot like the chromeos, except it&#039;s FF instead of Chrome...Wireless was great...*first* time ever, I&#039;ve had zero problems w/wireless on *any* linux distro...<br /><br />It made even more sense to me, than a virtual machine again, since this little fucker is easy to thro away, or hide &#039;on ones person&#039; as the jailbirds say ;)&nbsp; I could just about eat it, if I had to, and would be real easy to get rid of, in a pinch...and all I use on it are tor, and gpg and other stuff limited to this thing...nothing else, so it&#039;s always separate.&nbsp; LIttle 4gb sucker is perfect, with encryption and dropbox...<br /><br />I wondered if anyone else was doing that, or am I missing something vital?

				If you don&#039;t use virtualization you can&#039;t adequately isolate firefox from Tor.

The basic idea behind securing Tor browsing through a VM is to put the user&#039;s system in a sandbox. Even if an attacker were to be able to gain command-line access through a vulnerability in Firefox, Flash or JAVA, they still wouldn&#039;t be able to ascertain the victim&#039;s IP address, look at their file system or gain access to any other personally-identifiable information.

				VirtualBox to isolate TOR and OpenBSD x64 as the guest OS. Can&#039;t get much more secure than that.

				This may seem like a lot of extra work just to receive an eighth of the wacky tobaccie in the mail, but one can mitigate the risk posed by a &quot;bad seller&quot; by using po box (with fake id), or safe drops, as discussed elsewhere in this forum. <br /><br />Another option is proxy re-shipping service such as one offered by Rook. combine all three to be even safer. <br /><br />oh, the things we have to do just to get a lil high ... :)
