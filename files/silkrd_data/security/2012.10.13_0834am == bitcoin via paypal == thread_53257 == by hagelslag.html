				Do you mean that somebody else can look into your bank account, not authority related but more like family?<br /><br />If not, paypal is probably just as traceable. Unless it&#039;s possible to send money to a paypal account first and then forward it to another one which you use anonymously (is this even possible?).<br />You can buy btc off of other people which is generally not recommended. <br /><br />Oh well, time to eat some bread with hagelslag and check this again later since I&#039;m wondering if this is possible myself ;)

				Never ever use Paypal to buy Bitcoins!! Depending on which country you live in, look for a cash over the counter solution to buy your coins. That works best for the country I live in but if your from the U.S, there are other methods which may suit your needs. Just search the Forum for previous Threads covering this topic. While it&#039;s NOT illegal to currently purchase Bitcoins, the less potentially &quot;Traceable&quot; information you leave behind when making a Bitcoin purchase which could link you to things such as SR, the better off you&#039;ll be. :)

				i think bitinstant via cash deposits at the bank are even easier than those using moneygram at cvs/walmart etc<br /><br />but if OP has been using intersango they are not likely going to be able use bitinstant due to my assumption of their location

				Before I started using Bitinstant, I purchased bitcoins via Paypal a couple of times through members on bitcointalk, ebay, and virwox but generally it&#039;s a really bad idea to do and is horrible in terms of staying anonymous...not to mention the high premium you pay for using Paypal....but I had just gotten off parole and felt untouchable&nbsp; :) in all seriousness though, please don&#039;t follow my bad example and find another way to purchase bitcoins.

				How is getting coins with paypal different than making a bank wire transfer?<br /><br />And also: how would they trace bitcoins to a bank or paypal account if you send the money from a to b,c,d,e,f-&gt; then the anonymous sr wallet nr, while using different identities with tor all the time?

				Meh I can put some insight on this, Have I purschased bitcoins threw paypal yes. How much was it a very small amount to gamble online with. The problem with getting bitcoins threw paypal is this, one thing is that you have to send it as a gift. There is no if and buts about it. Secondly Paypal does not allow you to purschase online currency with there system. They freeze accounts they figure out whats going on. There are people on the btc forums still do it, but you have to get sort of active on the forum to allow it. And the rates are rediclous. Now how are you going to transfer funds with out having a card in your name, besides MP. Because with an MP you can get bitcoins off Sr. Bitcoins are not illegal and SR has a tumbler they go threw anyways which is why it takes along time to get them transfer to your sr account. Secondly there not going to trace the bitcoins, no one ever got arrest for buying bitcoins. So really its the drug charges you have to worry about.

				Ah, yeah good point. They freeze the account.<br />If they wouldn&#039;t (and there would be no fees) than I think of it as being the same as a bank wire transfer. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong. Apologies if this has already been discussed.<br />Either way it doesnt matter because it&#039;s not really possible.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really see the problem with bank wire transfers, besides getting rid of perhaps healthy paranoia. Buying bitcoins is legal and so is spending them, donating them, whatever. There are a trillion sites with addresses to send coins to. Yes ofcourse it would be a huge coincidence if you buy bitcoins and they find dope at customs who call the cops. Also if the dope is worth as much as those bitcoins. But then again, lots is way overpriced here so how would they figure that out? Trace it? What if you don&#039;t like being traced while only ordering legal stuff on non sr sites and use sites like bitfog? It&#039;s your privacy, your money and you can basically deny and make up anything, IF you don&#039;t start sweating and shaking, I think things will be fine.<br />I bet there are people being extorted to send btc&#039;s anonymously or whatever. And I also bet there are sick fucks out there who hate somebody so bad that they occasionally order drugs to their victims houses. And also that there are people who accept all mail, and throw away strange/drugs stuff in the garbage can, while somebody else knows about it and picks it out.<br />How in the hell would the garbage robber be busted? Or would they bust the ignorant guy who throws away the stuff? How are feds going to prove anything?<br /><br />
