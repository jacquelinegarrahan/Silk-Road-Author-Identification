				I&#039;m seeing an influx of free sample offers lately, and although tempting, shouldn&#039;t we be extra cautious, particularly with new sellers, or would money have be exchanged for you to be liable?

At least here in the US. Defense against drugs you actually bought and the free samples through SR would be the same: I didn&#039;t actually order these drugs, someone else must have sent them to get me in trouble.

				The problem is a lot of the samples are coming from brand new sellers. If i was LEO, that would be my tactic too.

				Free samples are entrapment.<br />If an LEO posing as a drug dealer were to say HEY take these drugs man, just have them free. I&#039;m pretty sure that is illegal.<br />He has to have you pay to be able to arrest you.<br /><br />Just like giving free drugs to an officer wont get you a dealing charge. (watch out if someone you do not know ever says, &quot;here man at least let me give you a buck or 2 for the trouble&quot; or anything to that effect).<br /><br />Keep in mind that most LEO would much rather catch a dealer than a buyer. They are worth so much more.<br />Most LEO are going to pose as a buyer, not a vendor. They&#039;re going to try to get the vendor to give up some kind of info that can be used to catch them.

				I don&#039;t think that&#039;s exactly how it works, ianfleming.<br /><br />Free samples would definitely be entrapment, just as LEO selling them to you would be entrapment. The problem is that, in regards to entrapment as a defense, you have to prove that you wouldn&#039;t have committed the illegal act without the interference of LEO. That&#039;s somewhat difficult to defend seeing as we&#039;re on a website almost specifically for the purchase of drugs.<br /><br />As I understand the law, it also doesn&#039;t matter if you sell someone the drugs or just give them to them; under the law they&#039;re essentially the same.<br /><br />You always have plausible deniability when receiving through the mail, though. And, yea, they&#039;re much more interested in catching vendors than buyers.
