				I state it on my seller page and in all my listings that orders will be cancelled if the address is sent unencrypted. I could have had 3 times as much business as I&#039;ve had so far if people would learn to read. Is this an extremely common thing for other sellers also? I am just getting annoyed with it.

				It shouldn&#039;t make any difference to you (as a seller) if the address is sent encrypted or not.<br /><br />A buyer sending a seller an unencrypted address dosen&#039;t compromise the sellers security in any way.<br /><br />The whole point of encrypting the address is to protect the buyer from having their address intercepted as it hops along the onion network nodes.<br /><br />If it gets captured, it dosent effect you in anyway so I cant see why you would turn away customers who cant use PGP.<br /><br />

				I just think it&#039;s lazy and if you are not smart enough or ambitious enough to learn how to encrypt your address than you don&#039;t deserve to buy on here. Plus most of the people that don&#039;t encrypt it just seem like they are giving fake names. Not always but it seems that I get a lot more interesting names and addresses when they come unencrypted. Plus I don&#039;t want my return address compromised by some idiot using a fake name.

				Yeah OP you are being slightly stupid if you wont take their orders just because they wont use encryption. Makes absolutely no difference to your safety at all and really if they don&#039;t want to then that&#039;s up to them. Around only 20-25% of my clients use encryption which although is disappointing but it&#039;d cost me a lot more if I turned them away just for that.<br /><br />You are running a business dude, not a moral crusade.

				Vendors, there is a very simple browser-based PGP encryption service that you should instruct your buyers to use. Just direct them to this webpage and tell them to paste your public key and type their address:<br /><br />http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm<br /><br />It&#039;s going to allow even the laziest/stupidest buyers to encrypt their addresses since it&#039;s so simple to use. Also, please put in big bold letters &quot;no PO boxes / no fake names&quot; policy.

				I&#039;m tech-savvy, so PGP was a walk in the park for me to set up personally, and if you understand the reasons why you need PGP, and the mechanism that allows PGP to successfully encrypt your address, then it&#039;s a no-brainer.&nbsp; It&#039;s up to you whether you accept those addresses, or cancel those orders...<br /><br />That being said, some buyers are children like 12 years old (I&#039;ve spoken to one IRL--there *are* definitely children who use this service), and take every shortcut imaginable to do a transaction on SR.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever been a teenager, you know that some real risks simply don&#039;t seem that risky to you.&nbsp; You feel invincible and the thought of consequences of your actions, or inaction, doesn&#039;t really cross your mind at all.&nbsp; I guess partly because as a child, you haven&#039;t been around long enough to have seen or thought through consequences, and the effects they can have.&nbsp; &nbsp;I look back on my childhood and am constantly astounded at my level of arrogance, stupidity, laziness, etc.&nbsp; It just takes time I guess for young people to realize that every action causes consequences, and to have the ability to recognize those consequences prior to taking action.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never gotten into trouble with the things I&#039;ve done when I was younger, but I still learned, and would certainly do things differently, and more carefully, if I could go back.<br /><br />But back to the OP topic--you&#039;re the vendor, so you can cancel whaterver orders you want.&nbsp; But as others have said, it&#039;s not comprimising your security.&nbsp; The worst case scenario, I imagine, would be that since the address was sent in cleartext, it might possibly be intercepted, and then surveilled.&nbsp; Your package might be intercepted.&nbsp; As long as your packaging security is up to par, then there isn&#039;t a way that LE could track the package back to you the vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s only the buyer that will get screwed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Definitely advise your buyers who send addresses in cleartext to learn and use PGP.&nbsp; Some will take you up on it, and you will have taught them something new, and probably gained a good bit respect by proactively trying to do the right thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taught a number of users how to use PGP one-on-one, and it&#039;s actually somewhat gratifying knowing that you are helping them with security, teaching them something valuable, and preventing many uncessary problems.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t ask for payments or anything--those things alone make it all worth it.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Theres also the fact that I dont know if the seller would like to spend the time decrypting the message from me every time. Sometimes I feel it is a hassle for them and unnecessary. If there was a &quot;Please encrypt your address when buying&quot; message on the listing I would though

I don&#039;t think I will be &quot;instructing&quot; anyone to do anything. Why do we need to go from one extreme of making everyone use PGP which is silly to the other which is where it&#039;s now the vendors job to now babysit our customers and teach them how to wipe their own arses? We do not and I shan&#039;t be starting any time soon. <br /><br />It is not now and never will be the vendors job to tell their customer whether or not to encrypt their address or not, we aren&#039;t your Dad and we definitely aren&#039;t here to hold your hand, especially when with some of you fuck knows where your hands have been lol. Yes, on the one hand I would prefer people to encrypt their addresses but it&#039;s certainly not my fuckin job to tell them otherwise. I might try and give out useful advice on here as a Mod but on the Road I&#039;m a vendor and I&#039;m there to sell magic powder and job ends at making sure my stuff is good and packaging it in such a way that it gets to the custy. <br /><br />We don&#039;t need to hand over the responsibility we have for ourselves just because we can&#039;t be arsed to conduct ourselves responsibly. It&#039;s better to use PGP, it&#039;s advisable to use it and yeah people SHOULD use it but if you don&#039;t want to that&#039;s up to the individual and it&#039;s their choice that&#039;s all there is to it.

Since you clearly don&#039;t know the difference, you have no business arguing about it.<br /><br />Second of all, what the fuck do you mean by &quot;outsourcing&quot;? The JavaScript code runs in your browser on your computer. Outsourcing is when someone ELSE does the job for you remotely.

I can&#039;t believe how ignorant you are. This shit is open-source! You can look right into the code and see what it&#039;s doing! And if you can&#039;t figure out what the code is doing, then what difference it is which tool you&#039;re using? Following your logic, Tor and PGP guys could be reporting you to police right now, you dipshit.<br /><br />And what &quot;police&quot; exactly are they gonna &quot;roll&quot; to? LOL. The guy who wrote the tool is gonna go to his local police station and say &quot;Hey, cops, guess what, I have some bad guys who are using my tool to encrypt stuff!&quot; What&#039;s his motivation? And EVEN IF someone gets caught thanks to that happening, that kind of evidence is inadmissible in court because it amounts to warrantless wiretapping / search.<br /><br />BTW, the guy who wrote the tool and runs the website lives in fucking GERMANY. Wiretapping there is illegal. Read http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/28/international/europe/28germany.html<br /><br />So, quit acting like you know shit, Limitless. You just like to argue and be a big know-it-all. Or a troll. Or both. The only &quot;Limitless&quot; thing is your ignorance.

Like I said before, somebody unwilling to learn PGP probably doesn&#039;t understand how to run a script locally using their browser either (not that this is rocket science!).<br /><br />The more people who use an online service like that from SR, the greater the temptation for LEO to tamper with the online service. <br /><br />--<br /><br />On a slightly different subject, I don&#039;t think the people who are defiantly refusing to learn PGP are actually high schoolers. Some might be, but appearances on here are very deceptive I think. I think many of the apparent &#039;kids&#039; are actually people in their 30s and 40s or older who are simply shaky with all these newfangled concepts. I noticed before, that a lot of the older generation on the Internet use txtspk for example. I mean, that was ok back when people were using leetspk partly due to bandwidth constraints and security, but the people I&#039;m talking about aren&#039;t exactly aficionados of the pre-world-wide-web Usenet or bulletin boards. <br /><br />Finally; Java != Javascript.

You sound like a security expert of sorts. So tell me why shouldn&#039;t I trust SHA1? Yes, maybe SHA1 shouldn&#039;t be used in banking or military. But for encrypting personal communication it&#039;s just fine.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Louis is right for several reasons, but one of them is that it is used in banking.<br /><br />If you think your typical banking operation has decent uptake on the latest tech outside of a single digit number of investment banks in the planet, you&#039;re badly mistaken. In terms of security they are total dinosaurs. In secret they have lost billions of dollars because of this, but they are loathe to update due to entrenched management structures, false economy cost savings measures and poorly paid technical staff who aren&#039;t exactly at the cutting edge of tech. Also they are terrified of fucking it up because current management doesn&#039;t&#039; understand the technology at all.<br /><br />This aspect, and the big pile of money they are sitting on, make them the canary in the coal mine.<br /><br />This means if banks are using SHA1, we had better be at least 1 version ahead, indeed we ought to update ASAP when SHA3 comes out later this year I think.

That&#039;s not an inconsiderable length of time and enough for me to think there are organizations with the ability to crack it quickly (if you read about the history of crypto you&#039;ll see that the government&#039;s intelligence services have long had a tendency to keep the best goodies to itself and sponsor deprecated encryption standards in order to obtain an edge).<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why you would choose a potentially weak algorithm over a newer stronger version which there is no opportunity cost to updating your system. You download a new copy of PGP which uses SHA-2. You then import your private key from before. Bang. You are good. Problem gone.<br /><br />Cryptography is an arms race, there is no good reason to fall behind in it. It&#039;s not as if we&#039;re replacing expensive machinery or something. The most you ever will have to do in any kind of update situation is generate a new PGP key pair and inform your contacts of that change using a message signed with the old private key if they email you with an encrypted message using the old public key. That&#039;s like a maintenance job you do once every two or three years, hardly time consuming or eternally frustrating.<br /><br />--<br /><br />On the issue of feasibility, it is a matter of time, computer power and motivation. We currently have time on our side, but the government&#039;s memory is long, so why take any chances.<br /><br />I mean, SR is not a huge target *right now* this minute.<br /><br />But what about in 2020? In 2030? By then quantum computing and powerful cloud networks will be in vogue and available to nearly anybody (quantum computing halves the strength of a PGP key which is why some people are using keys twice as long as normal e.g. Liberte&#039;s 8192 bit encrypted volume for example). SR itself probably won&#039;t be around by then if for no other reason than DPR retiring to some tropical island, but my point is that the relative importance of darknet black markets is likely to rise considerably in the next decade or two to put it mildly. People who are not targets today, could become targets tomorrow in a world of less expensive CPU cycles and more motivation. To make an example of those dudes who started off the whole thing. Doesn&#039;t sound like science fiction to me.

For example, if some vendor decides to require 100% encryption from buyers but doesn&#039;t want to lose 50% of his business, posting simple step-by-step instructions on how to encrypt by going to a simple webpage will likely get the job done.<br /><br />Please also consider that there&#039;s more to encryption than using the right tool - for example, covering your tracks, using an encrypted volume to store information, etc. For example, if a user simply installs PGP tool on their computer and then imports a seller&#039;s private key to it, BAM - there&#039;s evidence that the user has contacted or had an intention of contacting said seller. In some countries, simply having an encrypted volume that authorities can&#039;t get to is enough to land you in jail. So, using a tool like hanewin.net is beneficial in that NO information is stored on the computer other than an entry in browser&#039;s history.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to repeat myself 100th time. I&#039;m not suggesting everyone to jump on this hanewin.net which apparently uses outdated algorithm. I do suggest it as an alternative to NO encryption for buyers who are too lazy/non-technical to learn how to install and use one of PGP tools.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to thank all the contributors to this thread - there&#039;s a bunch of great easy-to-understand technical information that I&#039;ve learned and I hope others will too by reading this.

				Actually, I&#039;d say that it does compromise your security a bit. Not enough for me to cancel orders, but there&#039;s definitely some, albeit small, additional risk.<br /><br />What if the pigs are already on to you and somehow intercept unencrypted addresses that are headed towards you. They watch you as you drive to the blue box, pull you over, search you, and find the packages that have the names that they intercepted on them. That&#039;d be enough to get a warrant and then you&#039;d be fucked.

I don&#039;t know everything about it either, but I do know that:<br /><br />SR doesn&#039;t use SSL because SR is a hidden service. SSL is only relevant for webpages on clearnet and SR is not on the web. Inside the Tor network itself everything&#039;s already encrypted so using SSL makes no sense.<br /><br />Is it trivial to analyze and intercept regular HTTP traffic at an exit node, yes. Which is why you should prefer SSL when accessing the web from Tor.<br /><br />It is however, very non-trivial to intercept and decode traffic to a hidden service. You can use timing attacks etc to try and figure out where the traffic might be going, but it&#039;s not 100% and it doesn&#039;t help you on the contents of the packets.<br /><br />A passive adversary who managed to obtain most of the exit nodes/relays is not going to waste all that effort on busting SR, any such entity needs to show that trump card to aid traditional LE like they need a hole in the head.<br /><br />Finally, every last government that has tried to block Tor for good has completely failed. Even the Chinese couldn&#039;t do it, and they threw a lot of resources at it in terms of manpower too. They did manage to drop the number of users considerably at one point, but the network lives on in China.<br /><br />I&#039;m not claiming that Tor is invincible by any means, but I think you&#039;re overestimating the powers that governments have against strong cryptography. If you have a sufficiently strong cipher or you were using a one time pad, then all the power in the world couldn&#039;t decrypt your message. In the case of the one time pad, it&#039;s actually theoretically impossible. That is why the cryptoanarchists are so pleased with themselves, because there are things the strong cannot break and the weak can easily use in defense. Strong crypto genuinely takes existing presumptions about power away from the state and puts it in the hands of anybody.<br /><br />All hail to the geeks! :D

				I don&#039;t think vendors should Demand PGP usage... I for one have never used it... Why? Because I don&#039;t give a shit..... and If I get my safe addy busted somehow by some super elite police work catching addies off of silk road, then well they deserve to bust my safe addy :P But they wont find anything... My safe addies consist of friends that do not use drugs, and would never have drugs in their homes.. <br /><br /><br />I buy small orders of product off people on a weekly basis.... change my address almost everytime I order. <br /><br /><br />If this is for my protection then why give a shit if I decide I don&#039;t want that sort of protection?

				As a newbie to SR, one of the first things I did was visit the security forum and read as much as I possibly could.

He/She is a total sweetheart and a stand-up person for helping newbies like me with something as vitally important as PGP. I found it incredibly daunting at first, despite being computer literate, security was never something I had to worry about before. Thanks to Pine&#039;s tutorials and willingness to devote time and energy to dealing with newbie queries via PM, I&#039;ve learnt the very basics and it has even sparked an interest for me to learn about cryptography to a more in depth level.<br /><br />Massive kudos to Pine!
