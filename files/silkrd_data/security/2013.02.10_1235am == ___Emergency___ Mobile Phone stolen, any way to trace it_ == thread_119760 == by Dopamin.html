				Unless you had some sort of tracker app..<br />Try a text to it saying either :you know who they are you&#039;ll kill them etc/ you will give them money/ you will suck their dick..<br />

				As standard without having already activated the built in one or installing 3rd party software no unfortunately. <br />However if you tell your network provider NOT to block the imei number but DO block the sim its possible the thief or whoever its sold to might use it themselves. Police DO have ways to track it down and depending where your from they take it quite seriously. <br />If you block the imei anyone in the business would just send it to somewhere in the middle east where the blocks dont work. The police would expect you to have blocked the imei just lie and say you have. If its genuinely yours and you can prove it this lie wont matter. I feel for you but that is the only conceivable way you can use technology to get it back now.

				The phone can be tracked even if it is on or off, unless the battery is dead or removed. I would report it stolen, if the cops take it seriously, they will try to find the phone / person who ripped it off.<br /><br />By chance, is it an iPhone? You can report it stolen to Apple and they can do a remote wipe of all the data on it, unless the data is the important part of getting it back.<br /><br />Call the cops and if they don&#039;t take it seriously hound them until they take some action. Contact you wireless carrier as well and tell them the phone is stolen. They might not give you the info, but if you can get an LE agency involved they (the carrier) will give the pigs the GPS coordinates and any WIFI IP address it is connected to.<br /><br />oxyhoot
