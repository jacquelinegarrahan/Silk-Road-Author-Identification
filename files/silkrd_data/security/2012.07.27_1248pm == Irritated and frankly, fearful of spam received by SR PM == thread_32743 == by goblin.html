				Have any other vendors received something or the same as pasted below? I didn&#039;t like it as it looks for all the world like regular spam received in clearnet all the time. Reported to DPR and am waiting for a response.<br /><br />goblin<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />We are interested in doing business with you if you can offer quality products at fair prices.

				Somebody just PM&#039;d me berating me for posting an address for these people. It&#039;s part of the spam message and I don&#039;t think it matters. These are either: LE wanting to entice a vendor into doing somethihg stupid, or somebody who&#039;s completely clueless and who doesn&#039;t care about posting their unencrypted address to perhaps many, many vendors. And doing it in a very aggressive and pernicious way.<br /><br />Yes, I think it&#039;s approrpriate for me to expose them as much as I can.<br /><br />goblin
