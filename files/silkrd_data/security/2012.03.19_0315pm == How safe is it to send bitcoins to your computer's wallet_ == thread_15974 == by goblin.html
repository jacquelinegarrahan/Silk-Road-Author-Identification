				Hi, out there, I want to know if it isn&#039;t rather dangerous, in the sense that it could lead back to you, to send bitcoins from, say, an online wallet like Vibanko, to your bitcoin program&#039;s wallet in your computer? Or does it depend on how many twists and turns your bitcoins have made since you acquired them or taken them out of your SR account, etc.? Does using bitcoinfog or some other BTC laundry make it impossible to trace those coins back to your computer&#039;s wallet?<br /><br />Thanks, friends.

				if your computer is behind Tor it will not link it to your IP address but the transfer history may still be linkable to you. And yes, mixing services like fog/laundry will make it extremely difficult to follow the blockchain, that&#039;s why they exist. :-)

				question- what purpose is the bitcoin wallet on the computer? now i dont use btc for anyhting other than SR and when trandferring or needed a temporary resting place i use instawallet.org that way nothing btc related is on my drive. granted i never leave them in instawallet for long and its not a huge amount so i feel safe doing so.<br /><br />is it more secure?

				Taking security into your own hands is always the better choice. Also with instawallet you are trusting your money to a third party, what would you do if instawallet disappeared forever while you were completing a transfer?

				Right thats why I said for short amount of time and smaller amounts. if it did go down i wouldnt be too fucked but i&#039;d need to find an alternative. besides that is there any security risk? i guess i need to read up on the new owners stuff and see if i trust.<br /><br />i&#039;d feel safe with not having anything btc on my computer and risk the chance of just losing money, but its mitigated by smaller temporary transactions.<br /><br />cheers

				hmm, i have withdrawn btc to my wallet without using the tor option... fortunately i don&#039;t live in a jurisdiction where they would make that (aka me) a priority... nonetheless, does the blockchain (or &#039;transaction archive&#039; if you want to be less cryptic about bitcoin terms) actually contain my IP with every transaction or just the btc address and amount? ie, can these transactions be traced back to a certain IP years later?

( I know I was in trouble as a hacker, they had all my info in front of me, but didnt even know it, because they couldnt read IP&#039;s, bridges, routers, and the like.)<br /><br /><br />Just use TOR proxie for your wallet and you should be fine.<br /><br />hxxps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tor

But even that&#039;s not a full record due to change (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change).<br /><br />So if you sent out the coins from an instawallet address in pieces, instawallet itself would have to be compromised in order to truly tie you to all of those. And furthermore, SR itself would have to be compromised in order to access info on what address they controll, in addition to having knowledge of your SR account to tie you to specific transfer within that set of wallets.<br /><br />All in all, it seems to me like an investigator would already require DAMNING evidence just to tie the transfers to you anyway, so if it got that far, your fucked, and the BTC info is ancillary to the prosecution at best.<br /><br />Not saying don&#039;t be cautious, I just don&#039;t think the openness of the block chain is a weak point at this stage of the game.<br /><br />If there&#039;s a BTC expert out there who knows different, then by all means correct me.
