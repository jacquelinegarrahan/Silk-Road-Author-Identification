				I saw that as well.&nbsp; I&#039;d be cautious using Bitinstant in the future though with all the new federal regulations and guidelines put into place it might be more secure to get your coins elsewhere.&nbsp; Maybe try buying them direct from a BTC miner from localbitcoins?&nbsp; That&#039;s what I do and it works great.

				I only buy personal amounts...Not worried about the Fed&#039;s kicking in my door over some hash or a gram of blow..I use local bitcoins but the convenience of BitInstant is appealing.

				Thank the fuck christ!&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no way to get coins.&nbsp; I refuse to pay 20% to get coins to buy product that has been already jacked up 20%.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m really not worried about the DEA going after my $100-$200 a month I spend on SR.&nbsp;

				Be very careful. They had to cave to fed pressure after NY office raided and servers taken many months ago. After they come back from sudden 1week + downtime then assume every transaction is viewed in real time by fed.<br /><br />Yes buying BTC is legal. So is talk to friends, but that monitored also. Be smart.

				IF you&#039;re going to use Bitinstant then you should definitely at very least &#039;clean&#039; your coins before sending them to your SR wallet.&nbsp; Send them through an anonymous wallet that is only accessed via Tor so it can&#039;t be linked to your IP address.&nbsp; I would also suggest passing them through bitcoinfog or some other &#039;fogging&#039; service.&nbsp; You&#039;ll pay 1-3% for this but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />I still recommend localbitcoins to everyone.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great service and works a lot like Bitinstant since you can do cash deposits at banks anonymously.

				I agree. Either Localbitcoins.com, BST, or Bitcoin-Brokers. <br /><br />All three offer bank deposits which are a million times more pleasurable to deal with than ShitInstant, and their parade of ass-clowns at CVS, Walmart, 7-11 etc who look at you with glazed over eyes when you want to buy BTC.<br /><br />Ignore ShitInstant. They had their time. The market has better options now than it did a year ago.<br /><br />The WinkleVoss twins have made enough with their subpar offering.

				localbitcoins is the best bet IMO. If you can meet in person, do so. If you can&#039;t, you can still do it online. <br /><br />These are individual people who don&#039;t give a fuck about validating your address. Also, they have an escrow system to prevent you from getting fucked. Full https-enabled as well, so your transactions are (hopefully) kept by the site. I&#039;ve seen no reason to not use it with Tor other than it might look sketchier. <br /><br />BitInstant is going to have a lot more Federal Tricks up its sleeve now. There was no other reason for them to go offline really, if you think of it. They already had resurfaced the website to look more professional and clean, and their service was faster than ever.<br /><br />Suddenly, after the Federal push, it all &quot;needed work&quot; ::)
