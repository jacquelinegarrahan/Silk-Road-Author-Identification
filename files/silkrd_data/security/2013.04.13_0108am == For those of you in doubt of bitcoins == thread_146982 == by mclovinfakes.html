				So much coverage on Bitcoins recently. Do you guys really think it&#039;s just going to disappear just like that? Have faith in the coin!<br /><br />We jumped from &quot;This is toy money, durrr durrr.&quot; to &quot;It makes sense to have such a money system in the digital age.&quot; <br /><br />Clearnet warning!<br /><br />Kevin O&#039; Leary on bitcoins here to stay:<br />http://video.ca.msn.com/watch/video/volatile-bitcoin/16af1v4cr?from=en-ca-infopane&amp;cpkey=af7d2c74-d669-46f2-a98c-56afb656b8cf%257c%257c%257c%257c<br /><br />Bloomberg:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SLPy89gPE0<br /><br />Fred Wilson on bitcoins:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LU3uaQG10<br /><br /><br />Right now IMHO is the best time to buy bitcoins! It&#039;s already starting to go back up! If any naysayers want to cash out on their bitcoins, we will happily buy them off you. PM us<br />

				It&#039;s not going to disappear.<br /><br />Compared to a few months ago, there are...<br /><br />3 times as many transactions per day: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popular<br />(excluding popular addresses like Satoshi Dice)<br /><br />3 times as many unique addresses being used: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses<br /><br />Insanely higher USD trade volume: https://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume<br /><br />20,000 new accounts being created on MtGox every day compared to 2000 per day in March.<br /><br />Thousands of people still waiting to be verified on MtGox.<br /><br />Things can seem grim during a crash, but bitcoin is more popular than ever, and it&#039;s already bouncing back. It was trading at $130 a little while ago. That&#039;s higher than it was ever valued up until 10 days ago.<br />

				<br />It won&#039;t disappear, but it will recede to pre-mania levels, $15-25 USD would be my estimate, (30-60 days)<br />Right now it&#039;s still a feeding frenzy, even after the bubble popped (which I predicted 5 days ago, see my posts). I believe big money speculators are manipulating the market right now. The technical indicators, MACD/STOCHASTIC suggest BTC is overbought at current levels. Just because you believe BTC should be worth a lot, doesn&#039;t mean it will be. Iv&#039;e seen Pollyanish behaviour on these forums which amuses me, however folks will be losing their hard earned cash if they don&#039;t wise up. Hate to be a killjoy but I calls &#039;em like I see&#039;s&#039;em.
