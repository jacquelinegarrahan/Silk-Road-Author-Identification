				Hey!<br /><br />I decided to make my first purchase at SR but i&#039;m having problems getting bitcoins. I made an account at mt.gox just to find out that they need my ID if i want to wire them money via my bank account. Doesn&#039;t seem like a good idea to me, but can anyone clarify how risky sending them my real ID is? If you don&#039;t recommend it, what other course of action can i take to get bitcoins while staying anonymous? I read the forums about americans making cash deposits etc. but I live in northern Europe and bank transfer seems the only viable way for me to get bitcoins.<br /><br />Thank you for answering, and sorry if this has been already discussed in the forums :)

				Use Intersango instead. They don&#039;t require ID or charge commission.

				Ok I will give it a try. When i get my bitcoins in Intersango, can i safely send them to my SR account or should I use a &quot;third party&quot; before sending them? How safe is using money straight from my bank account to buy bitcoins anyway?

				Why direct wire from your bank account? Go to ATM, get cash and mail it with tracking# to some bitcoin exchanger or use Bitinstant they do cash deposit no ID in 10,000+ banks, and dwolla deposits, ect.<br /><br />

				Bitinstant seems only to work in the US. How can it be this hard to change euros to bitcoin. Again, is it safe enough if I wire money from my account to Intersango and then send them to SR? Can&#039;t find any other sensible option at this moment.

				I&#039;m also interested in this, what&#039;s the fastest way of getting coins from my real wallet to my SR wallet?<br />Clearly a bank transfer is the fastest, but like Nulkki said is it safe to load up SR with coins bought by my own bank account ???<br /><br />Also the FAQ recommends selling, if I were to buy some coinds from an exchanger on SR, I would be OK to then transfer them to my own selling account, yes? (aka do SR keep records of saless?)

				If you&#039;re in Europe buy a ukash voucher<br />Go to btc-e russian exchanger<br />Add USD funds, select &#039;interkassa&#039; (their payment gateway)<br />Select Ukash voucher. Add it<br />Presto you have a funded bitcoin trading account at only 10% or so extra which is amazing for Ukash
