				Has anyone ever seen the thoroughness with witch the police conduct a search? <br /><br />I have seen one close up but I was not allowed to see the actual search and they weren&#039;t looking for drugs. Here the police can refuse to allow you to watch a search if they believe it might hinder the investigation (bit of a catch-all really).<br /><br />This is because I generally keep a small amount of stuff in my house (with the exception of delivery days), my main stash being far enough away to be a real difficulty to get to every time I want something. So if the police do turn up how determined will they be? Presumably if they want me bad enough they can find anything but since I&#039;m not a big target I doubt that will be the case.<br /><br />There are many places to hide little bags and though there are well known places such as power sockets and so forth, but in a normal house there are many many things that can be dismantled for hiding. So to bring this back around to the question, I have no doubt they will check light switches, power sockets and so forth but does anyone know how much further a standard drugs search will go?

				My feeling is that for most drug searches, they would just bring in the dogs and let them sniff the sockets and such rather than just taking them all apart in hopes of finding something. But I&#039;m only guessing here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had my house searched with a warrant one time. It&#039;s important to note that search warrants must be &quot;particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot; (this from the Fourth Amendment...) In other words, they&#039;re at your house looking for a certain thing, and that thing is named in the warrant, not just looking around hoping to find something. Of course, if they do find something else in the process, you go down for that whether or not they find the thing named in the warrant, as long as they find it while looking for the thing in the warrant. One thing named in my warrant was a key, so this gave the cops license to search anywhere that a key could reasonably be concealed, in other words pretty much everywhere. They looked in every drawer and cabinet and closet, but did not rummage or ransack or make a mess, nor did they have us leave the house while they were searching. I have no idea at all if this is typical or not.<br /><br />But if the warrant specifies that they are searching for an outboard motor and they find some blow in the drawer of your nightstand, you (i.e. your attorney) can likely argue that the blow was found illegally because no judge will concede that an outboard motor could be concealed in your nightstand. So pay attention to what the warrant directs them to be looking for. And certainly it shouldn&#039;t need to be said that no cop without a warrant should be inside your house for any reason in the first place.

				Interesting, I can&#039;t remember the wording of the warrant (even in those distant days I don&#039;t think I was stupid enough to let a cop without a warrant into my house) but I don&#039;t recall any specific places described, only that they were looking for bombs and bomb making equipment (to this day I am not privy to why they thought that) and on the basis of that they turned the place upside down (not violently, but everything went everywhere). Unfortunately I am not protected by the 4th amendment, or any other part of the constitution.<br /><br />I wonder if dogs are trained for things like the 2C-Xs or PCP and suchlike.

				Depends on what they are searching for . Once upon a time, a friend of mine was the victim of a home invasion.5 doods mask and hoodies bust in guns drawn..bad news...anyway he got away by jumping out of second floor window to get help, but his asshole college roommate was so scared he insisted on calling the police.My friend pissed off, cleaned house removing large amounts of weed,paraphernalia etc..Cops come, search the house thinking &quot;burglars&quot; were still inside with their dogs...2 pounds of some serious dank was temporarily forgotten about in the basement, which was never found...we actually thought it was some type of police conspiracy for awhile....still to this day I have no idea how the dog didn&#039;t hit. My only guess is that from all of the constant weed smoke/incense it decreased it&#039;s senses....Second story a friend was raided...cops did the &quot;traffic violation&#039; trick then hit his house. In this case the cops completely destroyed his place. Shit was broken, dumped out etc...Even food was opened and dumped.

				Police are trained to look in places you thought they would never look. You should always assume they will VERY thorough. This is what they get paid to do.

				no cop is the same. no warrant is the same. I once had the door kicked in and they literally tore my house to shreds searched my girlfriend...not cool... and unscrewed electrical appliances. it depends on what the snitch says and how well that info can be used to convince a judge of writing a certain warrant. if I was a snitch and made 5 controlled buys of lets say pills and claimed the suspects gf kept them in&nbsp; her... hole, then a judge could very well write a warrant legalizing that search. <br /><br />1. the less a buyer knows about you and your stash, the less they could tell a cop, the less the cop could tell a judge, the weaker the warrant<br />2. dont keep anything in your trash can, many a warrant has been written based solely on suspicious garbage.

				It entirely depends. I had a friend almost busted for selling bulk ecstasy pills, and the cops just busted into his house with his dogs and through shit around. They missed a bowl that was laying on the floor behind a laundry basket, as well as a scale that was plainly on the desk with weed residue on it, along with a dirty vaporizer that was on a shelf nearby.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t tear anything apart too badly, but they did indeed trash the place, which is also probably part of the reason they missed so much. They only thing they did take was my friends pocket knife, along with his jars of Mushroom Mycelium, which they destroyed outside of the house foolishly, and then due to lack of evidence, the judge through the mushroom cultivation felony out in court, even in spite of the fact they had browser history and purchase records of him purchasing psychoactive species syringes, etc. <br /><br />Apperently the SWAT team had the maturity level of a bunch of high-schoolers, according to my friend. I guess it entierly depends on the department that is doing the search.

				I had a friend get raided by the cops for selling weed. He had about $4k worth of buds. They did a piss poor search, they missed a large pile of cash and several bags of drugs. No dogs.<br /><br />They did not search the garbage which is where the money was hidden. The other drugs were inside the furnature.<br /><br />If they had sent dogs the dogs would have been useless, the whole place stunk of weed.

				They are not very good and don&#039;t use dogs (vast majority of the time). If they were good or did use dogs I&#039;d be doing life.

				Stashing at dognose level is the worst idea, the higher the better. the space above your kitchen cabinets, cut out drywall behind magnetic crown molding,etc. just dont put it anywhere a mexican would put it (in the toilet, air vent,couch cusion,etc) and youll be good.

				Watch a bunch of movies about drug dealers, hitmen, assassins, spies, et cetera.<br /><br />Try to remember where they hide things in the movies.<br /><br />Then, when you&#039;re hiding your drugs in real life, NEVER USE ANY OF THOSE PLACES, EVER.<br /><br />Because cops watch movies too...

				Depends on where you&#039;re at. When the local drug enforcement agency raided my friend, they were very thorough--took his posters down to check for sheets taped to the back, opened cupboards, checked vents, etc.

				Never been searched, but it obviously depends on the officers, their motivation, what the crime suspected crime is etc. Always assume the worst though.<br /><br />Furthermore, I have had a few friends get pulled over and cops just not care about weed or pipes. Also, in college I had cops come into a friends apartment (girlfriend of the friend was scared and let them in) and a bong was on the table.<br /><br />A dog is very difficult to fool from what I understand. They basically just want to please their master (don&#039;t blame them they were bred to do so)

				They can be VERY thorough. Or they can be really sloppy. It really depends on who&#039;s conducting the search, how their day&#039;s been, how long they&#039;ve been on the job for and if they really want to nail you or not.<br /><br />The trick is to never be in a situation where a search can be conducted in the first place. Most people waive their 4th Amendment rights, giving LE the right to rifle through their belongings.<br /><br />&quot;Sorry officer, I don&#039;t consent to any searches.&quot;<br /><br />Even if you assert those rights, the police are still *legally allowed* to lie to you in order to gain your permission to search you, your belongings, or your property. They can promise you all sorts of bullshit things, threaten to bring in the dogs (who would damage your property), or say just about anything to gain your consent to a search. So many people fold out of fear.<br /><br />LE can still break the law, search you illegally against your will, then lie about it later. That&#039;s what a good lawyer is for. If your rights are violated, no matter how scared you are or how fucked you think you are, CONTINUE TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I know of several cases in my area where cops were made to look like monkeys during trial for doing illegal searches and seizures, then lying about it. A lot of people walked.<br /><br />Know your rights and assert them. ESPECIALLY IF THEY&#039;RE VIOLATED. Then get a good lawyer. If LE has shit notes on why they initiated a search in the first place, the prosecutor will toss the case against you right away if your lawyer has any skills at all.

				LE make mistakes sometimes, but only very stupid people think the police are stupid.<br /><br />The best thing is to always presume your enemy is as smart as Einstein and will be as cunning as Sherlock Homes. Never make their job any easier. <br /><br />The best thing to do is not let it get to the point of a warrant. In the UK I had a friend that the police knew was dealing and they quickly got a warrant, however the warrant was for his current registered address at his parents house, when the police turned up they found that he had moved out to his girlfriends house and found nothing. His dad rang him up and said they were on their way. This should have given him time to clean the house, however the guy had some drug problems and basically just did nothing and got arrested. Now him and his girlfriend are in prison, idiots. <br /><br />But say I left figure prints on a package I sold over SR which got intercepted or was purchased by LE, in this case their is no snitch, but if my prints are on record they may know were I live, this could be enough for them to act and move in. You would have to be an idiot thou to keep a stash in your own house as a vender that&#039;s registered to you. But then a lot of people are lazy as well...<br /><br />ACAB <br /><br /><br />
