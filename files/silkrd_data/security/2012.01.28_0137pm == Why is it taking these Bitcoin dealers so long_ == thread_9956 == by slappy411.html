				Anyone know why it takes so long to convert moneypaks to bitcoins? I have two moneypaks being processed by two different dealers, and they have been sitting there for three days now. It used to only take a few hours. Whats up with that?

				Unfortunately, we have only two choices: Processes moneypaks as fast as they come in and get shut down by big green dot (one reason new exchangers turn scammer). Or continue to process at the speed that we know is workable to allow us to operate for the long run. No one can cash out unlimited moneypaks so when demand shoots up it&#039;s either slow down processing or price everyone out. I wish I could give you a better answer but at the moment it&#039;s either be patient or find someone with availability. When bitcoin prices drop demand for bitcoins goes up.

				If your concern is that you got scammed, I wouldn&#039;t be concerned.&nbsp; Neither of those vendors will screw you over.&nbsp; Personally, before I buy anything from anyone, I reach out to the vendor first.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this will go fine for you.&nbsp; Next time, shoot them a message first.
