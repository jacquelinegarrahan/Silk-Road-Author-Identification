				Link doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; What do you mean by took down?&nbsp; TOR was never down.&nbsp; Are you talking about the botnet that slowed it down?&nbsp; Are you saying that the FBI is/was operating a massive botnet?

				Type &quot;FBI tor&quot; into startpage.<br /><br />I think that is what he is talking about -something that we knew weeks ago.<br /><br />clearnet: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/<br /><br />The FBI installed malware on freedom hosting&#039;s server.<br /><br />

				An FBI agent made some statements during Eric Marques&#039;s hearing on September 12 which the media spun into the FBI &quot;admitting&quot; to taking down FH.<br /><br />This whole fiasco shows how the media plays telephone with news stories. The only reliable source of info is the Irish Independent reporter who was in the courtroom. Everything else is a retelling on top of an interpretation on top of a retelling.<br /><br />Presumably anything inside direct quotes has not been botched, and so far nobody has attributed &quot;Freedom Hosting&quot; to direct quotes coming from an FBI agent&#039;s mouth, so they haven&#039;t quite admitted it yet. Although it&#039;s probably true.<br />

				It&#039;s weird though. You&#039;d think that if the FBI got the &quot;largest facilitator of child porn on the planet&quot;, they&#039;d publish a press release. LE is all about PR. Like that methylone bust, Farmers Market, and thousands of others.<br /><br />Maybe they are waiting until his extradition is guaranteed.<br />

				If I were a vendor this would be different, but I have worked with the assumption that anything unencrypted I do is &#039;available&#039; to &#039;them&#039; ... that I can get hacked &#039;if&#039; they really want to hack me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like many people using SR I&#039;m no leet coder, shit, NoScript baffles me at times, and TBH I wouldn&#039;t know all the weak links in my online presence, I&#039;m sure there are a few though .... <br /><br />I mentioned this a few weeks ago, EVERY TIME I have booted ToR in the last 4-5 weeks, it&#039;s really slow and (I watch the network building via the relay map)&nbsp; I end up at some ToR &#039;alternative&#039; which has less than 1550 relays, EVERY TIME, the last being about 2 hours ago when I booted it today.<br /><br />The first time what alerted me was how it told me I was connected and there were only (exactly) 1500 relays ... which I though very suss, so I&nbsp; closed it completely via the task manager (as vidalia hadn&#039;t closed) and rebooted it, and this time I had 4300 odd relays, and I was good to go .... since then, every time I have booted ToR this has happened, it often will say it&#039;s &#039;looking for a relay directory&#039; when it&#039;s booting, and this is an indicator that you&#039;re going to the &#039;wrong&#039; set of relays!!<br /><br />It&#039;s also much slower than the &#039;real&#039; ToR and pages wont load, first time, in fact IIRC the first time this happened I noticed I had to reload every page which annoyed me enough to have a look at the relay map and this is when I first noticed it.&nbsp; Today there were 1547 relays when it told me I was logged in and ready to rock .... there are 4037 relays on the map as I write this, IME (the real) ToR never has less than 3900<br /><br />&nbsp; This is really strange,&nbsp; and although I mentioned it here a few weeks ago in a thread I made, in the security forum, and also over on reddit, <br />&nbsp; only a few people replied, and they all pretty much either said they didnt know what I&#039;m talking about!!&nbsp; ...... anyone?&nbsp; <br /><br />surely this has happened to someone else or one of you guys can enlighten me?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />cheers all<br /><br /><br />mighty mixed muddled motek

				Jack I said I haven&#039;t got the link. Check the site, I know about the botnet and the weeks of slow connections,this is the first time the feds admit it. It&#039;s no fake link or such poppycock just a website with an article other people are gutted they haven&#039;t found.&nbsp; The site is called rinf( rebellious independent news and film) google it with your tor configured obviously...rinf.com/FBI/behemoth<br /><br />Or rinf.com/alt-news/latest-news/fbi-admits-to-exploiting-tor-to-take-down-childporn-behemoth<br /><br />So no its not old mate. story was written 6 days ago.<br />astor I meant FBI admits to&nbsp; infecting&nbsp; tor&nbsp; my mistake.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I meant jack.
