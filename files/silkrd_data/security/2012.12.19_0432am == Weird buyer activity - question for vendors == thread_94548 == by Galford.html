				Anyone else here have strange buyer activity, in that the same person orders - in the same 24 hour period - 1 item, then 10, then 5 then 1, where the item is always the same, and I give discounts for bulk, why would this person do this?<br /><br />Anyone else encounter this?<br /><br />

				That&#039;s strange.. I would message them and ask them if they would like them all sent in 1 shipment?<br /><br />It&#039;s possible they just don&#039;t understand how the ordering process works... Eh, trust your gut.

				... I&#039;d message the guy, and if you get no response or don&#039;t like the response you get, just cancel the orders.&nbsp; It&#039;s very odd indeed.

				I&#039;m not a vendor, first of all.&nbsp; So this could happen every day for all I fucking know, and since I&#039;m sane, it obviously looks nutty as Hell to me.<br /><br />But here&#039;s what it sounds like, and now please don&#039;t take this as definitive or anything: he&#039;s probing.&nbsp; For what?&nbsp; Vulnerability, I assume.&nbsp; Maybe he&#039;s the one who launched this stupid lame-ass attack.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t see any reason why he&#039;d be doing what he&#039;s doing... I mean unless he&#039;s retarded or on better drugs than I&#039;ve ever had.

				Galford,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been having a lot of weird buyer activity too....for instant, a buyer just messaged me tonight telling me he got robbed and could I front him some weed!!!! Then I had a buyer change up his name too, but he didn&#039;t order random orders of the same thing though. I say man go with your gut and if you find yourself questioning a order...cancel that sucker! Cause I know if that buyer of mines had not only kept changing his name and ordering random orders I would&#039;ve cancelled his order.
