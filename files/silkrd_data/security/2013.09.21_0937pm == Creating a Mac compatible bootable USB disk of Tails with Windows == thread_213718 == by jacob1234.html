				Hello all,<br />I wasn&#039;t sure where else to post this. Security seemed the best place.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to create a bootable USB stick that is compatible with an intel-based Mac. I only have a Windows machine and a liveDVD version of Tails. I&#039;ve tried formatting the usb disk many ways. GUID seemed to be what is compatible with Macs and that is the scheme I used. I then tried extacting Tails to the disk which completed but it is still not recognized at boot up. I&#039;ve tried many many different combinations of partitioning tables. But nothing seemes to work.<br /><br />To make matters worse I don&#039;t have access to the main disk on my Mac (main reason I&#039;m needing Tails to run. Also it seems that when formatted as GUID my Windows machine does not recognize the drive.<br /><br />If anybody has any ideas, that&#039;d be great. Thanks.<br />

Newer (x86) Mac hardware is more or less supported by Tails, no need to download a special version. You may have a hard time having it boot: Apple hardware is a pain to support, none of us has any, and we rarely get enough input from users to actually do anything about it.<br />Comment by Tails — Mon 08 Oct 2012 02:39:52 PM CEST<br /><br />comment 2<br /><br />I have a 2011 macbook pro, I can boot from DVD but the USB + refit method fails. So if you have a 2011+ mac your probably out of luck too. I found loads of threads about problems booting on mac but no real progress in the last year in solving the issues unfortunately.<br /><br />Tails - Reading one of the previous threads where a guy called Rod described that the implementation of an EFI bootloader is a potential work around for allowing the USB to boot from reFit on the 2011+ Macs, Did you read this and if so do you think it is a viable solution for you guys to implement an EFI bootloader when creating the tails bootable USB stick?<br />Comment by Anonymous — Tue 09 Oct 2012 08:25:35 PM CEST <br /><br />Source: https://tails.boum.org/forum/How_to_download_Mac_version__63__/#comment-21e7a892013b49e5adc88a096d302a31<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yes that is the exact same information I came up with.<br /><br />Looks like I&#039;m out of luck. I&#039;ll just stick with the DVD until I get my main hard drive back up and running.<br /><br />Thanks for your input.<br />

				I&#039;ve been trying to get tails for my mac, and I found a great thread with a step by step process, but it&#039;s for a windows or linux. Does anyone have a Mac version of this step:<br /><br />2 - Download the latest version of the Linux Universal-USB-Installer from here (latest stable version: 1.9.3.6) -<br />http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ <br /><br />Or is this where the DVD part comes in? (I&#039;m a noob to all this, forgive me)
