				I was reading about this yesterday. The main feature is that it scrapes publicly available content, like public Facebook profiles. I don&#039;t know why people are continually surprised that stuff they post publicly on the internet can end up in someone&#039;s database. :)<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to be profiled by government agencies and LE, don&#039;t post public content. Actually, don&#039;t post to any social media in an identifiable way.<br />

				I wonder why myself.<br /><br />So.....<br /><br />If I open a Facebook account, and call myself &quot;Limitless&quot; somebody might start a folder on me ???<br />Start talking about BTC, military trucks, and stuff.<br />All that information must be a double-edge sword. I do believe there were people using their clearnet internet handles on SR. Maybe there still is.

				I&#039;ll tell you what fucking pisses me off. Today Facebook told people that I &quot;liked&quot; a famous brand product. No I fucking didn&#039;t!<br /><br />Modzi

				I got off &quot;the facebook&quot; grid last year, when coming out of my drug induced fog, I realized all this shit was going down. (yes I was too stupid-or high- to realize it)<br /><br />Now, I am my cat on FB, and only have 2 friends, and they are super close, super stealth, and also either dogs or cats. - We post everything as if we were our pets talking about humans or catnip&nbsp; ;), or whatever. <br /><br />We even started putting real shill accounts with pictures we grabbed randomly online and made up names like Robin Liberty (that I just made up) - but you get the idea. <br /><br />Clog up the information they got. Pollute the hell out of it. It&#039;s fun! Get creative! You can make as many Hotmail yahoo whatever accounts as you like (cause you need an email addy to begin with)<br /><br />I no longer have any email or facebook that remotely ties to my name or location. <br /><br />And fuck the smart phones. I had the GPS chip removed from mine by a techno-geek friend of mine. <br /><br />I&#039;m becoming a prepper. <br /><br />I have no trust in the Gov&#039;t (here in US and everywhere else). In fact for the first time in my adult life. I actually fear the government. - Not paranoid. Just aware. <br />&nbsp;

				The article was a nice read. They bring up some very valid points as to what this software really is and isn&#039;t capable of doing. Unfortunately software like this has existed on smaller and larger scales for a long time. There are plenty of&nbsp; &quot;crawlers&quot; I guess you could say that can scrape up names, numbers, addresses, photo meta-data, etc from tons of different pages. For many of the users on here, how much do you think Google or other companies already know about you? Chances are Ratheon gets a nice big pay check from a marketing or advertising agency because this is a better marketing tool than a security tool.

Mobile phone companies keep your tower data(a rough location) for years. Some phone companies even provide high res gps data for years on end.<br /><br />One thing I know is not to carry any mobile device when doing drops. They can do a correlation attack. I don&#039;t even carry those credit cards with the RFID.<br /><br />Your smartphone is not loyal to you, but the company that controls it. They could turn on the camera and microphone at any time and you would not know it.

				My FB profile really only gets the science-loving atheist side of me.&nbsp; But, I did find out that some idiots started a SR FB page.&nbsp; All the users on it have handles written in Arabic, and it has, like, 20 likes, but I mean, what kind of fool does that?&nbsp;
