				Hello Peace Knights,<br /><br />I will tell you with a little english. Suspicious packages customs is having trouble, so I got some suggestions.<br /><br />+ Do not use pencil and poor handwriting for a4 envelope-cover. I recommend square envelope for pencil (like heart and christmas pattern).<br />+ Use a sticker on the a4 envelope and i recommended fake consular, government or university logo. Refer to the printer for Envelopes.<br />+ Envelope as flat as possible. Swelling in the middle of the envelope, be suspicious.<br />+ Use a business envelopes for less grams and toys or not working router/pc parts. You can fill the inside of the router or cd-rom.<br />+ Customs man open the envelope and check. They direct encounter your item. Always add a gift. Gloves, boxer etc. <br />+ Do not use the DVD CD case because they are not moron.<br />+ Create a hidden area in the envelope. May be appropriate to air bubble envelope bag.<br /><br />if you have something on your mind, you can reach me. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/messages/send_message/811a07b00d<br /><br />Goodlucks<br /><br />hedehodo<br /><br />

				Good suggestions. I&#039;m still not sure whether to go with the family looking package or the business looking package. Some postal workers tell me crappy looking family packages get less looked at than business looking packages but then I have some telling me the same thing vice versa. <br /><br />

I agree with you. Creating a suspicious package, customs distress warrant. I do not know too much english. Eastern Countries not use of x-ray. Your mail reaches the mail Postal Distribution Center. If suspect, move to customs department and invitation letter.<br /><br />hedehodo

				Where do you live? Each country is different from the circular letter.<br /><br />Yes, light weight and less powders good for envelopes. If it is greater than recommends that not working 14” X 12” X 3” Display Screen assembly. You will pay $9.00 for it. <br /><br />If x-ray hacking, look radiation-proof leaded glass (it should not). For dog, red pepper flakes, and coffee blend. What do you fit envelope :-) How much weight. Sorry for english.<br /><br />hedehodo<br /><br /><br />

				This has some great advice and you should give it to your brother. You have to represent the man. Your want Dogfight words? What are you up to? Keep it clean and manage fear and anger. <br /><br />The only gold recommendations. Vendor implements its own plan and hard-burnt vendor knows that. The greatest risks tattle on someone to someone or rat out. Let that be a lesson to you.<br /><br />I sent you a ฿0.14 gift coin. You can see out of SR and use shipping expense. Go buy yourself something.<br /><br /><br />Cheerio<br /><br />hedehodo<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

These methods are very well known by customs, in fact some rogue customs/USPS inspectors came on these forums and explained a lot of their techniques and mostly all of them are there. <br /><br />The only problem with these techniques is that it&#039;s tough when you&#039;re shipping from a flagged country like the NL because you&#039;re most likely going to get a more thorough search.
