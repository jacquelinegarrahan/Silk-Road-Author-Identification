				Instead of shooting her, get your mate to talk to her, then bludgeon her unconscious, or preferably drug her with some roofies or GHB or something. Then while drugged, get the gear, and depending on what it is, leave some on her, or put some up her nose, or shoot the bitch up with it. <br /><br />Then leave her in a stolen car and call the police and say you see someone unconscious in a vehicle on your street and are concerned.<br /><br />Cops show up, and the bitch is fucked, and nobody has to shoot a bitch. Nobody found drugged in a stolen car is a credible anything, and will definitely end up in jail for awhile.

				Whatever happens with the bags and prints, she already knows that he is up to some dodgy shit.<br />As long as she is alive she can divulge this to authorities and compromise your friend.<br /><br />If you cannot bear to kill her then just kill her cat and say &quot;you&#039;re next bitch if ya say out!&quot;.<br /><br />If you are an animal lover then you cannot kill her cat. You might just have to scare the cat.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />I would give you some ideas for murdering her also. Though I don&#039;t really want to be (indirectly) responsible for some murder somewhere. <br />(please don&#039;t kill the cat either).

				Your friend can:<br /><br />1. clean the house nothing illegal can remain<br />2. no drugs for at least 3-4 weeks to clean his body<br />3. piss off the bitch so she takes action - she goes to the police with the baggie, police goes to the kids house, looks for drugs, finds nothing, drug test negative, no evidence other than prints and handwriting.<br /><br />He can say that those bags were used by him indeed and he kept LEDs or something like that in those, hence the handwriting, the bitch came up to him one day and put some bags in his hands, then took the baggies away, hence the fingerprints.<br />Make it believable, if he&#039;s not into electronics don&#039;t say he kept leds in the bags etc.

				What kind of stalker? Stalker in the rejected romantic partner sense?<br /><br />Invite her over and offer her a coffee. The coffee is drugged of course. When she is unconscious, get the evidence.<br /><br />After that clean your house, wait a few weeks, then ask the court for a restraining order. She will probably say all kinds of things to the police about you, but she will just look like the crazy stalker she is.

There is a chain of command for evidence. The Bitch could have stolen a baggie out of his garbage can with his prints on it then put dope in it to frame him. That would be my story. I would tell her to fuck off just to see what happened.....just make sure she didn&#039;t stash it in your house!

				I knew a guy that had his girlfriend take his pound of stashed weed to the police. They did arrest him and go through his house, but when the time to go to court came it was thrown out and dismissed simply because she could have just <br /><br />bought the drugs and said they were his, but needless to say your friend still needs to be careful if she were to go to the police and tell them she knows he has drugs they will probably impose a setup of some sort to try to bust him with the <br /><br />drugs in his possession. So either way he should clean house and lay low for a while.

				That&#039;s a good point.<br />Even minor celebrities have been killed by stalkers.<br /><br />If it comes down to your life or the stalkers then I would choose mine.<br />But hopefully it would never come to that. But how could you be sure? By getting them 1st, that&#039;s how.<br />Could tell police your concerns but you probably don&#039;t want that extra danger when you are up to illegal things.

				You sound like a 15 year old kid who probably shouldn&#039;t be playing with this shit to begin with.<br />Measure the risk, if she&#039;s a genuine risk to your freedom then get rid of her. Doesn&#039;t sound like she&#039;s not going to the police with it or she would have already. It&#039;s a bargaining chip.<br />What&#039;s she want out of this? People don&#039;t take these kinds of risk for shits and giggles.<br />Obviously she sees you and your friend as nothing but a joke. My thoughts are you (or him) are the kind of guys that look down at your toes when you meet someone who intimidates you. You freak out or stutter when talking to police and probably look the part of the average low end street dealer.<br />If you&#039;re going to be in the kind of business you&#039;re referring to you can&#039;t be a pussy. If you can&#039;t defend your assets, get out. If you can&#039;t afford a loss, get out. It&#039;s that simple.<br />I&#039;m not trying to bash you guys, this is a reality check. Not everyone is cut out to do this kind of business.<br />My advice, she&#039;s in posession of a controlled substance. Keep your living area clean, count your losses and move on.

				Any advice I have given in this thread errs on the side of not killing.&nbsp; I do not want any blood on my hands.<br /><br />There are people here advocating shooting her. Quite a few here are trying to influence the OP into murder (or getting op&#039;s friend to murder).&nbsp; Not me, I&#039;m trying to stay neutral!<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing the results :)

				Relax Jop. This kid&#039;s no killer. <br />Murder is the last result for anything, not because of&nbsp; moral grounds but because of the legal mess it can get you in.<br />Chances are people know there is something going between these 3 and if they did anything, they would be prime suspects.<br />File a restraining order if you&#039;re worried about her. Tell them you fear for your life, make up an elaborate store about how she&#039;s a drug addict and when you tried to take her drugs away she freaked out, got them back and has been terrorizing your ever since. Now there&#039;s reason for your finger prints on anything. You have the legal system on your side and if she shows up to the police with anything they&#039;ll just arrest her for posession.<br />Personally I would just say fuck it, pop an ambien and sleep it off until she gets bored.<br /><br />

				My thinking would probably be along these lines:<br /><br />1. Take drugs / drink with her.<br />2. Wait for her to pass out.<br />3. Pay an underage boy to come over slowly shit on her face as you video tape the process.<br />4. Offer a trade.<br />

				Normally i&#039;d just shoot her, but i&#039;d be concerned about police investigating her death finding the package. This situation is all about damage control.<br /><br />Does she live in a house or apartment building?<br /><br />If she lives in a house, sneak over in the middle of the night and burn her house down. This will destroy the evidence, and if she doesn&#039;t die in the process she will learn her lesson.

				2 options.. 1 you just fuck her over 2 you get your drugs back<br /><br />1) I would clean the computer and house of any and all illegal things.<br /><br />Call the Police and tell them you have a stalker and want a restraing order against her.<br /><br />Also at the same time tell them she has a large amount of drugs that she is threatening to pin against you.<br /><br />Get your story 100% and get a friend to agree with it. Your going to be questioned but stick to the story and get this bitch what she deserves...<br /><br /><br />2) Threaten her with buring down her house or blowing up her car.<br /><br />2.5) drug the shit out of her and get her to tell you.

				Did I miss something? Unless she really planned ahead (is she that good?) and wore gloves when she jacked your friend&#039;s shit then aren&#039;t HER fingerprints all over it, too? She couldn&#039;t wipe those off without wiping your friend&#039;s too, right?

				Call the cops and tell them she is holding.&nbsp; They won&#039;t care of course but possession 9/10ths of the law.&nbsp; <br />Call them and tell them she is holding and doing drugs in front of kids at her house.&nbsp; That will get their attention. Kids...<br /><br />Or, build a case against her.&nbsp; Start keeping a journal of everything she does and time stamp it.&nbsp; Send yourself an email<br />describing every incident at the time of the incident.&nbsp; Then if she ever does flip you can say she has been harassing you<br />for a long time.<br /><br />Or just listen to Limetless.

If one person can mentally hold him hostage like this his future isn&#039;t looking bright (no offense if this &#039;friend&#039; isn&#039;t actually you).<br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear the outcome of this but totally not expecting to.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good advice Thestral1. You know what helps in a situation like this? Balls. You (or they) need to clamp down and do it quick. I can&#039;t advise a permanent solution as a mod will see it and probably pull my acc/ for promoting murder, so I&#039;ll let you fill in the blanks, but with a situation like this, she will never ever stop blackmailing you...... and they just get worse. Once a blackmailer always a blackmailer, always a little worse (and dangerous) each time they do it. I see only one solution here, I&#039;m afraid. These sort of people are cowardly, yet dangerous at the same time. Only thing you can rely on, is that it will get worse. Shame I can&#039;t give the politically correct solution, because that would be not be a solution at all, but continue this cycle of abuse. Undekka&#039;s point valid.....&nbsp; but I wouldn&#039;t trust this sort of a person in court as they may find a way to weasel out of it, despite the fact that, yes, stolen evidence (if by LE) is inadmissible in court, she is not LE is she? Besides, according to a fucktard at McDonalds....... <br /><br />&quot;The seizure of evidence by a citizen does not fall under the same rules as those, ie the police, who represent the government in conforming to the constitutional issues of evidence collection.&quot; (Actually in LE for 30 years, but yeah, I imagine they eat hamburgers so it technically is true.)<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying I would do that myself in the same situation because I am NOT in that situation and until I am in that situation I guess I really don&#039;t know for sure, would I? But if you wanted a logical solution then you can&#039;t get more effective than a non-reversible severance of the Central Nervous System from the rest of the body for all time. You wanted logic, right?<br /><br />In reality though, this is probably never going to happen, and the abuse will continue for some time. But trust me, it will get worse and worse and trying to get crafty and outwit while leaving them alive is so horribly ineffective. I&#039;m not saying I would do that, I&#039;m saying I wouldn&#039;t not not do that, and if you want a solution I think really there&#039;s only one. You&#039;d be surprised by how far raw hatred will carry you. I think it&#039;s a lot easier than most people think, but getting away with it is what stops most people as they cannot solve this problem quickly and easily.<br /><br />Anyway. Whatever. I guess I don&#039;t like people like that. I&#039;m not saying to kill them, I&#039;m just saying don&#039;t necessarily not kill them, try and keep an open mind on the subject.<br /><br />I hope this post doesn&#039;t ruin my reputation as Silk Road&#039;s friendliest muffin. <br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty, healthy, and remember to get enough water and vegies into your system. Much love, everybody!&nbsp; ;) ::) (Sucky sucky sucky sucky.....!) :-*<br /><br /><br />[Edit. Speaking of bumping people off, I came across this in December http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=view_listing&amp;id=1360 . Good grief, I&#039;m not suggesting you make an acc/, buy it from coerd and then mix it into her food or coffee, which he says is untraceable btw, not at all..... (Seems a Razorspyne is registered on there, must be a different Raz though. ::) )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>BTW OP, if you need more info about the product at that link, just watch a few episodes of Breaking Bad&nbsp; 8)

				a friendly vendor might help you out......... just saiyan lol<br /><br />But yah I am of the mind you clean up. Call the bluff then put 3 in her. Even threatening to use the authorities against you is like putting a gun to your head. I say once you put someone in a position to kill you it&#039;s your own fault for not understanding your fucking with peoples entire LIVES. I otherwise am a peaceful person but if it&#039;s you or me doing jailtime....... You&#039;re doing it or you&#039;re dieing one of the two.
