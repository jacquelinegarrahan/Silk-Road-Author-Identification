I&#039;m trading u the biggest secret mankind has ever discovered...its from my book I have a phD in Biology and I have found out how to fight off illness with your mind I have provided u 2 technique pls read below will only take 3min----I will send whole book if u want a $20 dollar value if u want thx...Is there any way u can send a sample??<br /><br /><br />My address:<br /><br />(REMOVED)<br /><br />If it is good I will order large quantity thx<br /><br />Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you can use your minds for more in this world, that we haven’t fully tapped into everything they are capable of? If yes, wouldn&#039;t you also agree that you get what you focus on in this world. You can use positive thinking in this world to change various outcomes, fight off diseases &amp; many more things. Just concentrate on it and say &quot;good endorphins&quot; over and over again in your head while thinking what change you want to accomplish or fix. It really works, no joke. Before I was told this by God, my friend Rick used the same method to fight off AIDS for 25 years, he&#039;s still HIV positive but his viral load is nonexistent. Please believe me as I wouldn&#039;t steer you wrong. There is an even more powerful technique. To perform this procedure is as simple as 1,2,3. An infant could do it with its arms tied behind its back, locked in an unbreakable box, under 10 feet of water, with time ticking away about to run out. The medical term for it is The Valsalva Maneuver, Wikipedia it! Fighter pilots use it in combination with a G-suit to stop from passing out in the air, as it increases blood flow to the brain! You basically bear down like you&#039;re going to the bathroom and you wiggle your ears and tense your head muscles until you feel this pressure in your head. While concentrating on whatever outcome you desire. Still skeptical? Just think about the placebo effect. Our minds definitely control that I mean If person A can exhibit the same side-effects as person B in the control group, that&#039;s your mind controlling a definite result. A powerful responses in the body! In other words the control group&#039;s brain creates side-effects such as dizziness or insomnia, the same as the people that got the real drug. Check out the video I posted on my Facebook. God I hate Facebook. I spend way too much of my life in the bathroom trying to friend people and worrying about who unfriended me. I woke up this morning ate breakfast and then lunch oh sugar snaps almost forgot about my snack in between my breakfast and lunch, can&#039;t forget to mention that, oh boy I almost died and went 2 heaven, insert more boring nonsensical here. Then I went for a drive wow car move fast when I press pedal, now I&#039;m going to post some baby pictures. Isn&#039;t life grand! I hate you Facebook. I know you eat babies. I just can&#039;t prove it yet but one of these days, watch out...Oh ah, you even ate the rattle! Don&#039;t spill the beans because, I liked it but it unliked me so I had to like it back again but it fell off so I had 2 re-like the hell out of it, jeesh. Oops just went and spilled them all over myself and ruined everything. That ok, turn that smiley face around, never slipping, never tripping. Happy times are here again, you’re going to have more fun then you did the day before, for the rest of your life.<br />It works 100% guarantee or triple your money back, refunded 110%. Wait, wasn&#039;t it just a 100 what up now it&#039;s 110, what&#039;s going on y&#039;all , tell me what&#039;s going on, I&#039;ll tell you what&#039;s going on! But I know you&#039;ll stay safe, calm, cool and collected. Use it to help others, that is the most important thing in this life. Always remember the less fortunate and keep them in your thoughts and prayers. Praise Jesus our Lord and Savior. Don&#039;t perform this maneuver too much as you might pass out. But for the most part it is totally safe. It increases blood pressure in the brain. So be very careful if you have any vascular conditions. It also stimulates the vagus nerve. Upon leaving the medulla between the medullary pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, it extends through the jugular foramen, then passing into the carotid sheath between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein down below the head, to the neck, chest and abdomen, where it contributes to the innervation of the viscera. Besides output to the various organs in the body, the vagus nerve conveys sensory information about the state of the body&#039;s organs to the central nervous system. 80-90% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent(sensory) nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the brain. Just remember to be safe and use your intentions for good not evil. This is a powerful tool. It can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. Use it to help others, that is the most important thing in this life. Always remember the less fortunate and keep them in your thoughts and prayers.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete
