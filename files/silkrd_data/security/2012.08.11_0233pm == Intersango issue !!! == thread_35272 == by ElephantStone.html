				I set up my Intersango last Tues 7/8/12 and did a bank transfer ( i know its not totally anon but thought id give it a go ) Anyway the transfer showed up on Wed 8/8/12 But its set in a status of Pending_review !!!!<br /><br />Its still f***in in this status now the b****rds I opened a support ticket on Thurs asking why its in this status, this is the reply i got <br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />A pending_review status simply means that it has failed our automatic import but only because it has similarities to another import or needs manual verification for some other reason. The payment has been recognized and linked to your account. Generally payments pending_review are investigated every other day.<br /><br />So as not to count a single payment as two different payments (in the case that our bank changes their formatting as this has happened before) payments which are similar to other already imported payments must wait for a manual confirmation.<br /><br />The administrator is the only one who can verify this so please be patient. We are implementing a system to allow non administrators to perform these functions in the near future.<br /><br />We are sorry for the inconvenience but in order to remain in operation we do need to manually review a small set of payments. If there&#039;s anything else you wish to ask please don&#039;t hesitate.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Team Intersango<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />Never using there crap service again ! was hoping to get the coin so i could buy some stuff for V festival next weekend.<br /><br />Anyone elese had this and know how long it takes them to authorise it ? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen this before. It should take a day or two max (I don&#039;t think that includes weekends though). Don&#039;t worry this sort of thing isn&#039;t out of the norm for Intersango, which is another good reason not to use them.<br /><br />And that system they&#039;re implementing soon... They were saying that months ago. Lazy, greedy, and couldn&#039;t give a shit, that&#039;s what Intersangos customer service means to me.

				Im in exactly the same boat as you mate, after the recent fiasco and people started getting there funds I thought that I would be safe to deposit with them again. After sending funds 5-6 days ago my deposit is still stuck in the pending_review status and ive had the exact same message from the support staff, this was days ago and still nothing showing in my account.<br />Seem like they are still having problems...&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />They recently put in a new policy that new customers would have to wait 5 days for access to there funds, not sure if that applys to yourself but it might be the reason for the delay.<br /><br />Intersango really need to sort there shit out tho for sure, good luck with it mate, gonna keep hassling myself til I get my cash!

				They have been working fine for me since the big freeze. Deposits show up within 1-4hrs. The only problem I had was when I tried to do 2 identical amounts in one day. The second one didn&#039;t appear and still hasn&#039;t. Intersango support says its something to do with the bank worrying about duplicate payments and in future to make them slightly different. I keep using them because of convenience, I just make sure I do a small test payment first!
