				I put clear nailpolish on my fingers. Latex gloves do not work for me. There&#039;s got to be an easy way to obscure my prints. I&#039;d love to hear ideas.

				I have found that filling the latex gloves with warm/liquid paraffin wax&nbsp; and than doubling it up works nicely. (I.E. have the layers go hand - wax - glove - wax - glove)<br />This will completely obfuscate your prints and somehow it actually feels more tactile that using bulky gloves.<br />It feels more like my skin has super thick&nbsp; calluses than like I have gloves on. <br />and it allows you to moisturize your hands while working. the hardest part is to figure out the perfect amount of wax to put in the gloves and get your hands in it in time.<br /><br /><br />I got the idea because I have one of those ParaSpa machines but I never had the time to use it. until I was looking for various alternatives to bulky gloves that make it hard to handle small items.<br /><br />There are other way but I have found this one to be my personal favorite.<br />other include dipping your hands in a thick concentrated gelatin or &quot;Liquid LATEX&quot; (I think a lot of vendors should definitely look into that one) <br />Or you could go Full-on Anarchist cookbook and cut slits in your fingertips and insert grains of lye into the subcutaneous layer.<br /><br />Another thought that I have been playing with is the idea of stealing someones fingerprint and using that to confound investigators. <br />Imagine if you managed to get a set of the fingerprints for the owner of that office building that you use as a drop and you put his finger prints on the packages that you send from their mailbox.<br />Now if a package gets intercepted, the cops will be looking directly at that person instead of you. and you can keep an eye on your local &quot;Who&#039;s in jail&quot; to find out if he has been arrested and if you should rearrange your shipping points.<br /><br />i know that some of that is a little bit OverKill. but it could prove to be extremely effective.

				Why can&#039;t you use gloves?&nbsp; Latex allergy?<br />They do make a number of non-latex exam gloves.&nbsp; Nitrile, neoprene, vinyl... <br /><br />Even those cheap plastic wrap gloves they use for food service will obscure a print. <br /><br />Even with a latex glove they can occasionally pull ridge detail IF you&#039;ve got oil on the outside of the glove-- like rubbing your forehead or handling an oily product. <br /><br />If you&#039;re super paranoid you could always paint liquid bandage onto your fingers then put the cheap glove over that.

				Finger prints are shallow and they are dead skin.<br /><br />80 grit sand paper on a belt sander, 5 min later you have no prints. Go easy and take your time it does not hurt.

				Carders paint on liquid band-aid on to their fingertips, push ATM buttons with their fingernails, and open doors with the sleeve of their jacket/hoodie pulled discreetly over their hand. Not so sure about the sanding down your own fingers. That sounds insane and prob wouldn&#039;t work. Guess you could test it, also depends on the greasy diet you have. Why bother when liquid band-aid exists<br /><br />

There are people who are born without fingerprints, Masons (Brick layers) Tend to not have fingerprints because handling the bricks wares them off, A lot of carpenters do not have fingerprints because of the wood and sandpaper, the list goes on.. There are lots of professions where a persons fingerprints naturally ware off so it is not as out of place as you may think.<br />

				very interesting thread - I think there are types of gum bases glues that might work like the liquid bandage and&nbsp; cheaper.
