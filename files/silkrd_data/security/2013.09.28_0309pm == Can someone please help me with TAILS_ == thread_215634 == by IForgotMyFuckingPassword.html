				Yes, I am aware that there is a tutorial on this very board, but it&#039;s not working for me, so I&#039;d like to figure out what I&#039;m doing wrong.<br /><br />I should also note that I&#039;m an intermediate Linux user and that I have created several live USB sticks with other distros (Linux Mint, Fedora, Debian, OpenSUSE, Kubuntu, etc). I just can&#039;t get TAILS to run on a USB.<br /><br />First, the tutorial is for Windows users and I run Ubuntu, so I can&#039;t follow it line by line; but I have tried some of the suggestions nonetheless.<br /><br />I tried using the Ubuntu startup disk creator -- No go. No bootable media found on restart.<br /><br />I then tried doing it in the terminal with dd if=/home/me/downloads/tails.iso of=/dev/sdx. Still no go. Same error -- no bootable media found.<br /><br />Then I got deeper into the thread. I decided to try running Windows 8 in a VM and following the instructions using pendrivelinux universal installer. No go. Ditto for the reason.<br /><br />Finally, I just created a TAILS VM itself. Now this time, TAILS actually ran beautifully. The problem is that it refuses to recognize my USB ports, so I can&#039;t copy it to anything.<br /><br />Now before anyone says anything, I have the virtualbox extensions installed and I have the USB sticks enabled in the VB filters, so that&#039;s not it.<br /><br />What the hell am I doing wrong?<br /><br />And I loathe Debian, so having a Debian based OS mock me is pissing me off LOL!<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

				Did you try the &quot;manually installing...&quot; tutorial from the Tails homepage?<br />Maybe you should give Whonix a try. See my signature for a tutorial how to install it on a bootable USB stick (install persistent live Xubuntu to USB, install VirtualBox, import Whonix appliances).<br />You could also install Tails in a virtual machine on a bootable Ubuntu live USB stick.

				Thanks for the tip. I&#039;ll give that a try. I&#039;ve heard of Whonix, but I know nothing about it. Which version of Linux is it based on?<br /><br />I was going to give Liberte a whorl if I couldn&#039;t get TAILS running, but I&#039;ll try yours first.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You could also install Tails in a virtual machine on a bootable Ubuntu live USB stick.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Just to make sure I follow you, are you suggesting that I make a bootable Ubuntu stick, reboot running said stick, install virtualbox, and then try again by installing TAILS in the new version of vbox?

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Which version of Linux is it based on?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nevermind. I see it&#039;s baseed on Debian. I really hate Debian. I know Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it&#039;s the testing branch so it&#039;s a little different. I was hoping for a non-Debian based OS as an alternative, but I&#039;m still going to try your suggestion.<br /><br />Anyone have an opinion on Linux Liberte?<br /><br />Oh, and with TAILS, is it safe to install another DE (cinnamon, unity, or hell even KDE) or is that not recommended? Gnome 3 make me want to vomit.

				I think Liberte is not getting updated, so I would recommend against it. Don&#039;t know about the DE in Tails, but you can safely install another DE in Whonix. Just make sure Whonixcheck is started automatically with the desktop.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=215634.msg1571609#msg1571609">Quote from: IForgotMyFuckingPassword on September 28, 2013, 04:06 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just to make sure I follow you, are you suggesting that I make a bootable Ubuntu stick, reboot running said stick, install virtualbox, and then try again by installing TAILS in the new version of vbox?

So you could boot the USB stick into Ubuntu first and start Tails in a virtual machine on the USB stick. You could use Truecrypt to encrypt the virtual machines. But if you use virtual machines you could use Whonix right away. The desktop VM is isolated from the network, which adds a little extra security.<br /><br />You could also install Ubuntu on a USB stick and firewall it properly. Have a look at my other tutorial to see how to torify Ubuntu and safely get the correct time through Tor. But that&#039;s not as secure as Tails/Whonix.

I&#039;m concerned that I&#039;m going to have the same problem with Vbox that I&#039;m having on my regular machine; but you seem quite knowledgeable so I will definitely try your advice. I can&#039;t figure out why TAILS is the only VM that can&#039;t detect my USB. They are USB 3.0 ports and USB 3.0. Oh Jesus! I think I may have just solved my own problem. Do I need to use a USB 2.0 drive in my 3.0 ports? <br /><br />Now I vaguely remember that I had this problem before in Vbox, but that was with Windows 8, not Linux.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But if you use virtual machines you could use Whonix right away</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Here&#039;s my concern about VMs. When I run TAILS in a VM, it prompts with the warning &quot;virtual machine detected.

You think Fedora would be more secure or are they about the same security wise?<br /><br />That you can switch the DE in Whonix makes it very appealing. I&#039;d love to be able to run Cinnamon. Gnome 3 is just so awful! I wish the developers could fix that monstrosity!<br />

The host will only log that you used Virtual Box, if it logs anything at all. I think it&#039;s only visible when you ran Virtual Box the last time, by looking at the file time stamps. It&#039;s prboably not visible how often you ran it, but it&#039;s possible to see how often you booted the USB stick. That can be prevented however.
