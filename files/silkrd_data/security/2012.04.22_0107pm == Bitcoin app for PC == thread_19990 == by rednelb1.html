				Installed the app as a way to keep money in a &quot;wallet&quot; so to speak. I transferred money out of SR into it days ago and it has not shown up.<br />Checked block explorer and the transaction exist, but it is kind of cryptic to me.<br />Any advice?

				The block chain that contains all the btc data is huge. Unless you have a green check in the bottom right corner you might not have the whole thing loaded. It takes forever.<br />I had a crash in the middle of a bitcoin operation and had to reload the whole chain. Took 2 days.<br />But stupid me...I had a backup, an incomplete one but it would have saved time.<br />There is also a website you can download it from, I forget, I searched in the clear and downloaded it after the fact and it went in about 2 hrs vs 2 days so that&#039;s a better option than gettng the whole thing through the bitcoin client.<br /><br />I fire up bitcoin and let it run for a while every so often just to keep it caught up so it goes faster when I want to move coins.<br />And I&#039;m backing up my blockchain as well as wallet.dat too.<br /><br />There could be other things wrong.....maybe your not connecting. Next to the (would be) check mark is a bar graph. hover over to see how many connections you have.<br />If done in the clear you can get a lot. Through Tor I usually don&#039;t get many so I definetly want to update the lock chain in the clear before moving coins.<br /><br />If it is a block chain thing your coins will appear as soon as its updated if its been a while since the trransfer.
