				So I&#039;m going to start vending, but I want to use this account, which is the one that people know. However, I have used it to make a number of purchases. All of them have been successful, and I trust (as much as one could in this situation) the vendors I dealt with to treat my sensitive information with care. So with that being said, is there a big danger of me using this account strictly for vending now and setting up a different account for buying in the future?

Your feedback as a buyer/forum poster probably wouldnt help you establish yourself as a vendor any faster anyways. No need to risk it.

				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />+1 What v01d said<br /><br />When you decide to vend you should avoid making any purchases using that account ever. A separate buyers account is highly recommended While you may have developed some reputation as a member of the community but by vending from an account you have purchased from you create a reciprocal relationship between your shipping to address and where you are shipping from which even if all of your vendors did the right thing before does present some risk. It doesn&#039;t cost any less to have a separate buyers account and vendor account unless you were here before the vendor account fee was implemented then you would save ~$150USD but even then if you intend on vending to any reasonable extent this will pay for itself in the first month or two of vending provided you manage things properly.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />SecuritySolution<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQGcBAEBAgAGBQJPELBrAAoJEKhBWjky5wQCaekL/A2Ue8mlioPTP8xgx7ysqNac<br />th7vjvyAsEa0j8GRrkWL0QOgK3VkPXakXHX4WQlMQrLPDI4CZvyUFU43xmwndNWE<br />0hEW9qfvf4lQGEK52/oKo6rEmPM4I5W9AT5/5Nari6CYSWvgDqR29+R/wDIldDQE<br />2jIqWqJwtQou4gmIS2B9AiaG4ipbTHUf0QoMwb4ca037wOwU3347cKdihw2kWDF+<br />KHfe36aIUj0JqcvqmUKVTxFdp8IkoNWpyYWmM1oonzhniyJ72OHTmcirICd3IwAw<br />B6wFIFEoGSw1qg6CHjy9vr4Tz7T0QZoC6zwPjrFsIMfmfiRiOO1k+XcjAX7oMnr8<br />YR2DF7aavisXqqyTraRZ7y7z1QTlW3EKNldcDeYtIao2UMbD6KfIrfjrIhA+jBy1<br />iKSyolKWRvnAJvvPt+Zf66a/tKgXWhPWAC67h4Bt7GP5CSL3OJWL5BIGlXMQH0sp<br />zgF6OVAj9Vxlb+wGFaGkmg/T/oemV0OzVdMYHDqmZw==<br />=anpg<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />

Maybe I can just have it all go through my partner, and have him set up the other account, but it will be with my backing? I guess people would understand that.

				Although you &#039;trust&#039; those other people you bought from what if they were arrested and their security was shit? Cops go through and find messages from you, put 2+2 together and use the address they found on that guy&#039;s comp to go screw you. Who knows what kind of setup they have. They could claim they have quadruple encrypted everything and in reality are using WinXP pirate version full of holes and zero encryption for all you know<br /><br />

				&nbsp;I would keep buyer and seller account separate. Simply for the ease of mind. Plus if people have it in their minds that you are both a buyer and a seller, they are going to be wondering which other vendor you are wholesaling from,lol. Not that reselling in the same market is bad,but the image isnt good for an up and coming business. Its already hard enough to make a buck on here from what I gather.

				LOL VJ! <br />security and protecting your identity is the most important! any questions about this please email me at dumbass@yahoo.com<br /><br />i think the little extra SR cred is not worth the risk it can bring.. what if you end up being a close competitor to one of your previous vendors and they decide to take you out of the competition. (not saying anything bad about any vendor) but its a possibility... <br />i will insert eloquent phrase here &quot;Don&#039;t shit where you eat&quot;&nbsp;
