				My package finally showed up after 7 weeks in transit. When it arrived it had 8 small holes poked in it (about the size of a paperclip point) that went through the envelope, but not all the way through to the other side of it. Am I being paranoid or was this used to determine the contents inside?

				Sounds shady to me. Was the internal &quot;container&quot; whatever it was compromised?

				Hello dear OP.<br /><br />There are a ton of possibilities but the most common one I could think of would be that a post sorting machine &quot;ate&quot;(therefore the holes) your shipment and it was found weeks later and shipped finally to you.

				@TA: Yes the holes went through the plastic bag inside the envelope.

				How long have you had said package in your possession? If its been more than a day Id say a cd is highly unlikley and its just a fluke.

				Yes the package was seized. Yes it was searched. Yes they took a small sample and put the receiving name and address on a permanent government watchlist. The same thing happened to me for a package at a drop. If you have any shred of an instinct of self preservation then you will NEVER receive any contraband under the compromised name and address ever again.

				^ Guy beat me to it. You got holes poked, reagent tested, sent your way. They&#039;re just waiting for you to receive something worth busting down on, resources for these kinds of thing are spread thin as you can imagine given the revolution ;)

				Just seems weird that they would poke 8 holes. Seems like a big giveaway. But who knows. Be careful....

				Just means they were very determined ;) I&#039;ve had customs after my packages before, luckily back then it was all obscure tryptamines that obviously didn&#039;t test dirty for them.. When I had it happen and still had the packages forwarded to me I would get yellow tape though &quot;INSPECTED BY CUSTOMS&quot;.. And they never poked holes, just tore open the package.<br /><br />I would imagine if it *did* test dirty though they might repackage it to make it look like a shipping malfunction as you suggested.. So as to hopefully not alert you to an issue with innocent enough reason for a missing amount of the compound.

				I&#039;ve had a hole poked in my package before.&nbsp; I assume it was customs (not positive though) and they were probably trying to take a look inside to see what was in the package.&nbsp; Luckily when they did it, it did not poke through the internal vacuum sealed bags.&nbsp; If they *had* punctured that part then my MDMA would have fallen out all over the place and it would have been bad.
