				GPG can do both PGP and GPG messages/keys. Most people are running gpg. But before I could give you any help I would need to know which OS you are running.<br /><br />Doing it in Windows is different than on a Mac or under Linux. NOTE: I only know Linux.<br />

				Both GPG and PGP create OpenPGP compliant messages/files in accordance with RFC 4880.&nbsp; These days the difference is that GPG is completely open source, while PGP is a proprietary closed source program.<br /><br />You need to install GPG and create a keypair.&nbsp; Provide the public key of this pair to the vendor and anyone else you need to communicate with.&nbsp; You will need the vendor&#039;s public key in order to encrypt to them.<br /><br />To understand how it works, read this PDF:<br /><br />ftp://ftp.pgpi.org/pub/pgp/6.5/docs/english/IntroToCrypto.pdf<br />

				Hi,<br /><br />there is a very nice guide here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />PGP/GPG is quite complex, but for &quot;normal&quot; usage here you shouldn&#039;t need more than a few hours<br />to install and use it (that&#039;s not to say that you shouldn&#039;t try to learn as much as possible about<br />PGP, TOR, BTC, etc., the more you know the more secure you will be)<br /><br />cheers,<br />NQA
