				dam great though from Austrlia for a cash deposit we have to produce 100 point id. I don&#039;t know about anywhere else, as that is our only means of depositing cash.<br />So then purchase fake id etc and setting up multiple mtgox accounts.<br /><br />Thanks micro just got me thinking more about options <br /><br />cheers<br /><br />+1 if i could

				Do you actually need 100 points of ID to deposit cash into another persons account? I haven&#039;t deposited cash into another persons account in a while but I thought you could just rock up, give the teller the account number + BSB number and then deposit the money into it, leaving a note with the deposit (if you wish).

				Yea you can just rock up to deposit cash in a bank.<br />I think he&#039;s talking about depositing into mtgox.<br />beaner, try spendbitcoins.com/buy/ you can deposit over the counter at 5 or so different banks and the owner&#039;s a nice guy.

				<br />its like a mt.gox proxy service he actually purchaes off gox and then gives to you so yes if gox can handle the demand, then so can Jeremy (spendbitcoins owner)

				ah ok then , I got it wrong $5000 deposit and $500 transaction fee is a little hefty, but then again going through crypto I&#039;ll probly lose more and their volume is no where near as high.

				I don&#039;t have much if not any stature but I can vouch for spendbitcoins. <br /><br />Prior to that I always used Drcc who was a vendor and had very little fees but the turnaround times could be horrendous.<br /><br />Spendbitcoins has always been same-day service when I get home their in my account. <br /><br />Just also keep in mind the % fee when doing the order as recently I entered my amount and forget the fee and was short for an order :(.
