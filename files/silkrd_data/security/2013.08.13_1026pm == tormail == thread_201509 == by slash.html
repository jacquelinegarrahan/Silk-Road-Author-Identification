				&quot;In order to carry out the attack, the FH servers housing the websites and services were compromised, meaning that their owners have also been unmasked. Owing to the fact that FH was considered a trusted anonymous hosting service, the owners of Tor Mail will also have considered themselves anonymous and therefore could not have been forced to reveal anything about a Tor Mail user to law enforcement agencies.<br /><br />Should Marques turn out to be the owner of FH as has been reported, however, it would confirm that FH security has been breached. That being the case, every owner of “deep net” websites and services including Tor Mail housed on FH could have lost their mask of anonymity in the attack. Since the attack, Tor Mail has remained inaccessible&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Is this article saying that tormail owner also have to be arrested in order for LE to get info on a tormail users account?<br />Why is there no announcement from tormail owner about this event?<br /><br /><br />

				no.&nbsp; As the guy allowed anyone to create a website I&#039;d say that he&#039;s unlikely to be the admin for any of those.&nbsp; Just keeping FH up would have been enough.<br /><br />No one knows who owns it because no one has ever come forward to say.&nbsp; It could have been one of the government agencies all along or it could have been the dude who owned FH or it could have been someone completely different.&nbsp; Since tormail hasn&#039;t popped up again, nor has anyone updated the status of it, I&#039;ll leave you to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />the only thing you should be really sure of is that the serves must be considered compromised, so if you sent or held anything indiscreet on there you should consider yourself on a list.<br />

Each of those sites had their own admins, ie people who operated the account and the software on that onion, but he was the overall admin of the server. You can host multiple onion domains on one server. FH hosted at least 400. That&#039;s the number I&#039;ve seen quoted.<br /><br />The evidence that FH admin was also the Tormail admin, or at least that Tormail was hosted on the FH server, is that both web sites served the same exploit at the same time and then went offline at the same time. The evidence that Eric Marques is the FH / Tormail admin is that he was arrested and described by an FBI agent as being &quot;the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet&quot;, and that happened around the same time as the exploit and FH / Tormail / all those cp sites going offline.<br /><br />It&#039;s circumstantial evidence, of course, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty good evidence. FH certainly had one of the largest caches of child porn on the planet, if not the largest, so there aren&#039;t too many other things that FBI agent could have been talking about.

				lol we took the question differently.<br /><br />he was the server admin for the host but certainly wasn&#039;t the site admin for each of those sites - that would have been down to whomever created it.&nbsp; or should have been.

				This is what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. Hosting Tormail at the same place as FH is about the dumbest fucking thing that could&#039;ve been done&nbsp; &gt;:( :o
