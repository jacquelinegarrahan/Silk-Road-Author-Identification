				No.....You will need to ask for an out of state deposit slip that they keep behind the counter.&nbsp; Ask for a few of them so you have some for next time.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Its an easy process<br />You will need to keep your deposit receipt and take a picture of it and send it to the company.&nbsp; <br />I have a mac so after I took the picture I did a screen grab of the picture so there would not be any data attached to the photograph.

				Sometimes they don&#039;t ask for any ID, even if they did doesn&#039;t matter. You&#039;re just buying bitcoins. They won&#039;t know where it goes after that if you move it around enough, or use the site bitcoinfog or similar laundering site.<br /><br />

				Assuming you&#039;re using a service like bitinstant, you DO NOT need to bring an ID to deposit. I don&#039;t know what people were talking about with out of state deposit slips....<br /><br />Here&#039;s what you do:<br />1) Print the &quot;deposit slip&quot; they give you. Ignore the instructions to hand that printout to the teller. <br /><br />2) Copy the: a) Account Number, b) Routing number (rarely needed... but just in case), c) Account Holder name, d) Account Holder Address, e) Account Holder Phone, Total Deposit Amount.<br /><br />3) Bring EXACTLY (to the cent) the amount of cash it says to deposit. If you require change, the bank will likely ask you for ID and a signature to confirm the deposit. Avoid doing this at all costs.<br /><br />3)Go to the bank and pick up a deposit slip. Just your run of the mill deposit slip.<br /><br />4) Fill out the appropriate details on the slip (leave the checking or savings boxes blank... if asked by the teller... say checking). <br /><br />5) Go with the money in an envelope (including coins) and take out the money and coins, the deposit slip and hand them to the teller.<br /><br />6) Once that&#039;s done, check the receipt to make sure the deposit information is correct. Keep the receipt until you&#039;ve verified funds are deposited. Although bitinstant promises money within an hour, banks in iffy neighborhoods can take longer because they check the bills more thoroughly. <br /><br />Some Notes For Using These Services: <br />1) Avoid deposits of over $400 per visit even if your service permits them... they can sometimes seem suspicious depending on the bank branch you&#039;re in. <br /><br />2) Try and get the amounts to be an even dollar amount. $400 seems less sketchy than $401.63 (and handing the teller $1.63 in coins...). You can do this by calculating the fees charged... usually something like 6%+$1.25 (but this depends on the provider you use). <br /><br />3) Don&#039;t deposit more than $400 per destination exchange (aka mtgox) account per branch. Aka don&#039;t go deposit $400 in a Bank of America at 9am, then another $400 in the same or another bank but have all of that going to the same mtgox account. I guarantee this is an easy way to get flagged (especially if you&#039;re using the same type of bank each time). I suggest rotating destination accounts and bank branches. This way you can deposit tens of thousands of dollars in the course of a day if you&#039;re willing to drive around the city a bit.<br /><br />4) DO NOT use Tor when accessing services like bitinstant. Your money can get flagged and then you&#039;re screwed. Instead, hide your mac address and connect using public wifi services away from your home.<br /><br /><br /><br />
