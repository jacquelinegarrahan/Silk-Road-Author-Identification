				Do you know the requirements to be a cop? Almost fucking nothing.&nbsp; The majority of cops are fucking stupid.&nbsp; This is an assumption, of course, but I&#039;m pretty sure if you cleared the history and all the jazz, you&#039;re fine, the last place he would want to investigate hardcore into the deep spaces of his hard drive, is his own computer.&nbsp; Unless he also suspects that you&#039;re some sort of drug dealer.

				I do not store any other information on the computer besides PGP info on Kleopatra and the Tor Bundle.<br />Lets say he did suspect I was dealing and they eventually went and got a warrant and&nbsp; MY laptop was seized for evidence. What do I need to do if I ever want to get rid of all my SR info? <br />I could just be too paranoid but am trying to reason with myself here and keep the anxiety down.

				Sounds not just a little bit paranoid... WAY paranoid.<br /><br />Having PGP info and tor bundle... that is not even suspicious. Most people wouldn&#039;t even know what that was for, and it certainly does not have one use.<br /><br />Take it easy bro. Smoke a J.

				I wouldn&#039;t be particularly concerned. Assuming you&#039;re in the US, they can&#039;t force you to give up any passwords, and so they&#039;d have to find proof elsewhere that you were involved in drugs somehow in order to get a warrant. There are other uses for Tor and PGP, and if they (anybody) find them on the cop&#039;s computer, I think it&#039;s more likely they&#039;ll think it&#039;s the cop&#039;s than yours. And the cop will probably just assume his son installed some new-fangled computer program.<br /><br />But you should store as little as possible on your computer at all times. =]
