				Hi,<br /><br />I withdrew my bitcoins from SR to an anonymous wallet with blockchain. It has been three hours and the bitcoins are still not there. How long does this take? Should I be worried? Please reply, it is freaking me out right now, big amount of btc.

				It can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 or 6 hours for the bitcoins to show up on your account. I think each bitcoin transaction needs 6 confirmations from the bitcoin network. hat is where the delay is. Hopefully you won&#039;t have to wait too much longer ;)

				There&#039;s some weirdness with account withdrawals and deposits going on right now.&nbsp; Just hang tight and if you don&#039;t see it within a day, contact support.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be faster than that though.

				Thank you for your reply, it&#039;s 100+ bitcoins and i transferred them about 4 hours ago now. When I search the fake address on blockchain I see all kinds of random addresses. But I guess I should calm down. But does it take longer to withdraw to a anonymous address?

I am sure your coin will turn up, but I know how it feels to be waiting for it to show. Put it out of your mind for a bit and it will be there before you know it ;)

				Yes, this is normal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall the reasoning for it... I think it&#039;s to help prevent LE tracking people down even if the server is compromised.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t really remember the reason I was given.&nbsp; Still, that&#039;s normal.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to say I think it&#039;s stupid and should be changed, but whatever.
