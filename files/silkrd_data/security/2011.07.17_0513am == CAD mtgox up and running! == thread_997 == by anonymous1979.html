				That looks like a great site for you canooks...all in one place to do everything. I wonder why someone in the us hasn&#039;t done something like that? I just know the traditional ways, Bank-dwolla-Mt.gox/TH-wallet-sr&nbsp; Granted, it would be a one stop shop for LE, too..<br /><br />Maybe its worth the extra steps we have to go through..

				This is great.&nbsp; Our healthcare sucks, btw.&nbsp; Unless you have the patience of a boulder.......<br /><br />But why the hell are people (sellers I hope not!) sending cash straight out to bank accounts.&nbsp; Sniff sniff, here come the bloodhounds and parasites for that money you didn&#039;t earn.&nbsp; &nbsp;Get an anonymous credit card from the caymens and LR or pecunix it out there, then pull it from an ATM.&nbsp; It&#039;ll cost you maybe 3% - 5% but it&#039;s better than Canada Revenue sniffing around your house.&nbsp; That can only lead to bad things.....

				It doesn&#039;t have to be the caymens, I just use it because my uncle spends a lot of time there so he got me an account with an offshore bank to funnel [state-sanctioned] investments in there.&nbsp; The same bank also gave me a pre-paid credit card with no name on it.<br /><br />There are a few reputable companies that do LR prepaid credit cards.&nbsp; If you sign up for Liberty Reserve and check out their merchant section they have a list of approved merchants, some of which do the prepaid credit cards (they are pretty much all offshore.&nbsp; I have a backup card from one of the former USSR countreis that I use if I am over my daily limit on the caymens card).&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to tell you the name of the company I use or the pertinent details since that puts a really narrow window on me, but they are out there - you just have to look.<br /><br />I personally prefer pecunix because it&#039;s gold-backed (as an anarcho-capitalist I approve of all non-state money, precious metals included), and is totally anonymous.&nbsp; You can also connect to it via Tor (LR and Mtgox will not allow this), and there are credit card issuers offshore that only charge $1 - $2.50 per ATM transaction for USD withdrawals.&nbsp; Usually a $10/month card fee or something like that, plus you have to pre-load the card with a non-accessable balance (usually $25 - $50 so they are guaranteed the monthly payment).&nbsp; But they are usable all around the world.&nbsp; they aren&#039;t anonymous in that the company has your information on file, but they are WAY safer than using banks - an international warrant would need to be granted to look at those records.&nbsp; And even then all they would have is a bitcoin conversion company&#039;s information who they would then have to go through the same process with, and then they would have to try to actually associate an IP with your btc transactions (if you are using a tumbler this is nearly impossible).&nbsp; Just makes it extremely difficult for the bastards to try to take your money - they wouldn&#039;t even be going after you for drugs at that point just tax evasion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Keep your money out of the system so the only place in the US those dollars show up is an international clearing-house verifying your ATM withdrawals within 24 hours of it happening.&nbsp; That&#039;s it, it&#039;s cash in your hand.<br /><br />Be very wary of&nbsp; banks - especially US banks - that new Dodd-Frank piece of shit bill puts the screws to US bank customers even more.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp; I would be moving my assets offshore asap as the parasites are sharpening up their fangs and suckers.
