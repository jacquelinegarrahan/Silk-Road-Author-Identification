				So I know they are trained to smell for things like Heroin, Cocaine, Weed, MDMA etc..<br /><br />But are they trained to smell 2-c Chemicals, or Ketamine? I have been wondering this for awhile.<br /><br />I think I read somewhere they are trained to smell acetone so coulden&#039;t you pour a shitload of it in-front of your doors to fuck up the dogs sent too? <br /><br />But yeah, mainly curious about 2c-x and Ketamine &amp; any other interesting information about dogs that anyone may have. <br /><br />Thanks!

				The dogs can be trained to smell anything that has a scent, I believe,<br /><br />Ketamine is much more likely to be detected than 2c&#039;s for instance. I don&#039;t think there are many 2c sniffer dogs out there, as it&#039;s not very high on the priority list.

				I posted the below to another thread... it seems appropriate info to post here too.<br /><br />------------<br />&quot;I&#039;m told that Sniffer dogs are not trained to smell drugs. They are trained to smell the residual solvents &#039;usually&#039; left on the drugs post &#039;work up&#039; I.E. toluene, acetone etc. I think it is probably true because firstly, most drugs in their pure form are virtually non volatile and therefore actually have no smell. Secondly, it makes sense that the dogs wouldn&#039;t be trained to sniff &#039;actual&#039; drugs because that would be seen as &#039;cruel&#039; and dangerous for the dogs to continuously sniff drugs everyday while training.<br /><br />To make your stash solvent free you can either use prolonged gentle drying in an oven or make a vacuum desiccator (best).<br /><br />Sometimes lazy cooks will produce batches that will be difficult to remove all the solvents from because the solvents may be mixed in amongst other liquids that are not very volatile like left over P2P from the reaction... in such cases and in other similar confounding circumstances consulting Uncle Fester&#039;s Books will help as he has a few pages dedicated to problem solving ( via providing detailed clean up methods) poorly &#039;worked up&#039; gear, I.E. melting crystals, waxy looking crystals etc etc... there is too much info to write it up here.&quot;<br />------------

				And one more thought:&nbsp; Most dogs are being currently trained to detect explosives, for security, for the military, etc.&nbsp; Like @ShardInspector stated, most drug dogs are trained to find precursors and poorly sealed packages.

				Sorry to be contrary Party Girl, but it&#039;s important I make the distinction so that others who may be at risk have the right information at the forefront of their minds.<br /><br />I did not state that &#039;precursors&#039; were of concern. That&#039;s because there are thousands upon thousands of possible precursor substances able to be made into illicit drugs and they cant train the dogs to &#039;alert&#039; on even a tiny percentage of them as well as that many of them are ubiquitous and plenty of them are even commonly found around the house.<br /><br />What I wrote was:<br />&quot;They are trained to smell the RESIDUAL SOLVENTS &#039;usually&#039; left on the drugs post &#039;work up&#039; I.E.toluene, acetone etc.&quot;<br /><br />Keep in mind, I&#039;m not saying my advice is gospel, like I stated,&nbsp; it&#039;s just what my sources have told me and I believe the information to be factual.<br />If I&#039;m wrong and someone knows otherwise, I&#039;d be pleased to be shown to be wrong in order to get the correct facts by some member replying with them.<br />
