				Do you guys keep using the same Instalwallet/bitcoin addresses over &amp; over? Or do you generate new ones all the time?

The only way to launder your bitcoins is by running them through a tumbler such as BitcoinFog for an adequate period of time; what you get back will not be the same bitcoins that you put in, thus you have successfully laundered your bitcoins. You can send them to a thousand instawallets if you desire and it will add no extra protection compared to sending them to just one wallet.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92826.msg654072#msg654072">Quote from: davidkelly on December 11, 2012, 04:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92826.msg654052#msg654052">Quote from: SRtester on December 11, 2012, 04:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">So how safe is Instawallet?

For long term storage you should be using either the official client on your computer with a sufficiently strong encryption password along with multiple encrypted backups, a brain wallet, or a paper wallet, again with encrypted digital backups.<br /><br />The same goes for Silk Road - do NOT use it to store your Bitcoin. There is no guarantee that it will be here tomorrow, and no guarantee that the &#039;fail-safe&#039; will work. The whole idea of Silk Road is that we do not have to trust the operators - we use PGP and sufficiently laundered Bitcoin as a method of payment for that reason, amongst others.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I normally use bitcoin fog but I also use Blockchain and I noticed the other day that they have an &#039;anonymizer&#039; anyone know if it works as well as bitcoin fog?&nbsp; It would save me some time for sure.&nbsp; Also bitcoin fog goes down a lot which always worries me.<br /><br />Either way you should never store your coins in a digital wallet for any length of time.&nbsp; Personally I only ever have as many coins as I need to get what I want so I don&#039;t usually have to worry about them getting stolen.

BitcoinFog have maintained a good reputation and Tor presence thus far; however, to mitigate the risk to funds I would suggest tumbling small amounts of Bitcoin for a couple of days at the time, and then sending them to your Bitcoin client (run through Tor, of course).<br /><br />Do this frequently and you&#039;ll always a pot of tumbled coins with which you can purchase products on SR.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Instawallet does essentially tumble your coins for you.<br />If you deposit into instawallet and withdraw (even immediately and blockchain shows your coins are still in that instawallet address) they will come from a different address.<br /><br />eg: I deposit into Instawallet address A and withdraw to my Wallet B. The coins that end up in Wallet B came from Instawallet address X not A.<br />This appears to be the case if you withdraw immediately while coins are still in address A or if you wait for instawallet to send them elsewhere first.
