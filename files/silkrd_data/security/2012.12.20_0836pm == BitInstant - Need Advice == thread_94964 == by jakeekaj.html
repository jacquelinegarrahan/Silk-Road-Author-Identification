				So I have a question... I made my first Wallet with the default Bitcoin client. I then went to Walmart to use the BitInstant method. It was my frist time and I used my real info and had the Bitcoins sent to my Wallet. I then transferred my wallet to BlockChain.info because it was easier to use there. I then transferred from there directly to my SR account and placed an order...<br /><br />Now I know next to use the BitInstant method with fake info and send it directly to my SR account.. But will I be ok since I messed up the first time? Should I go and delete that wallet on blockchain.info if that is even possible? Any advice is appreciated...

The reason your information is even required is to check it against the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) database for prior red flags. The reason they implemented this is to cover BitInstant&#039;s ass if/when they require AML/KYC documents (Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customers). So if a Federal Agency doesn&#039;t like a certain transaction that took place then Bitinstant would forfeit your information to the Agency filing the paperwork. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94964.msg673086#msg673086">Quote from: jakeekaj on December 20, 2012, 08:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should I go and delete that wallet on blockchain.info if that is even possible? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can, but it won&#039;t delete the transaction ID that leads back to your Bitcoin-QT client, then back to BitInstant.

				You will be fine. Buying bitcoins is not illegal. SR has its own mixer that shuffles your coins around to make them even harder to trace. Just use fake info next time.

I stated that it was possible, that does not in fact mean that it&#039;s probable. I&#039;m of the idea that the less of my information floating around the better. I agree that more than likely nothing will come of this. But it never hurts to err on the side of caution. Besides I&#039;m not telling him to don his triple-layer tinfoil hat and hide under a faraday cage. I&#039;m simply telling him to create new bitcoin addresses and handles to seperate himself from those transactions as much as possible. Thanks for clarifying though, upon reading my post again I do seem to come off as a bit paranoid. But I suppose that&#039;s more of a bonus than a handicap on this side of the internet.

				Thanks for the reply guys, I myself don&#039;t think anything will come of it but just wanted some more opinions. Next time I will use fake info and send directly to SR. For now I will delete my old Wallet and make a new one.
