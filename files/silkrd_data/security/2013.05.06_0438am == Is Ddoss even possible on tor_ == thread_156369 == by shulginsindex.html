				Is Ddoss even possible on tor?<br />I can think of only one method but that would take the dosser ages and ages so i rule that method out. On tor how is this possible? Just curious

				Though a fucking digital shitload of HTTP requests I&#039;m guessing. Because it&#039;s Tor, it&#039;s real tough to tell which ones are for real and which ones are bullshit. Still, it&#039;s possible and clearly they&#039;re using the right tactics at SR to combat this bullshit.

				This was my thoughts when ppl kept saying it was under DDOS attack, I WAS LIKE WTF? this is tor , these are onion sites, everytime a server or a member logs on its never the same IP..&nbsp; So i reached out to some pro&#039;s and They felt it was no way a DDOS attack could happen,<br /><br />BUT&nbsp; A DOS attack is more Plausible .. I posted the diffrence betwee n the 2 on another thread. DDOS ing a Tor onion site makes no sense, and i agree OP only way i could even possibley see it happen is the method u mention..<br /><br />i COULD BE WRONG, i am not saying i am 100% correct, but this is who i reahed out to told me and my own research.. DDOS&#039; ing one specific Onion site is as i see it IMPOSSIBLE, unless your somehow attacking the whole TOR network,<br /><br />WHICH if u know how TOR&nbsp; came about u should know its gonna take a team even if then to bring it down..<br /><br />Tor was made for Gov special Ops missions, to send out their location without giving it away over the net when contacting HB or HQ.. <br /><br />Anyone that see&#039;s any flaws in what i said please feel free to correct me..

				Well this ddoss attack is well ochestrated. They would have to install a hidden partion on the victims hard drive to run tor and script a program to attack as its a bit tricky. as i say def possible, but time consuming. Its been a while for me and tor is new to me so i could be wrong.

				It still is a hellla king move to DDOS OR DOS A TOR SITE. It almost makes me think it would have to be somone with the knowledge or the program of the TOR network itself..<br /><br />Has it crossed the minds the people who keep TOR what it is could not have possibley been paid off, or decided they wanted a cut since its a Free service, and where better to hold ransom than a drug site knowing the money we bring through here..Not saying thats what it is, but when things happen, everyone is suspect.<br /><br />Also has NO ONE ELSE considerd a SQL injection at all??

Hell we don&#039;t know where SR is or it&#039;s environment so it could be running on a hidden service that is a VM in an existing high traffic SSL based site. That site being used as cover traffic for the tor service. If the cover site was under attach then SR would go down and the person or persons perpetrating the attach would not even know they took down SR.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I for one do not believe the &#039;DDoS attack&#039; story. I would like to see some details and evidence about how this could happen. <br /><br />I think the management f*cked up and spent the downtime rewriting half their code, and blamed it on an &#039;attacker&#039;.

				For the billionth time, DDoS and DoS are both possible against Tor hidden services. Not only can the actual hidden service be DDoSed by a botnet with http spam, but there are also Tor specific attacks that can be carried out. For one DDoSing introduction nodes leads to the hidden service they introduce for being unreachable, for two if the attacker traces to guard nodes they can DDoS them directly. Anybody who says it is impossible to DoS or DDoS hidden services clearly it not very read up on how connections to hidden services work.

It seems to match the symptoms. As Astor and I noticed, rebooting Tor would suddenly make it easy to connect to SR or SRF. If SR was truly being attacked with some direct method this shouldn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />Somehow somebody is able to identify which introduction points are being used for a specific hidden service. That&#039;s where my hypothesis gets to be on shaky ground, because I don&#039;t quite see how that would work. I thought introduction points were selected randomly from the list of Tor relays. It could be something else entirely but so far this seems to make most sense to me.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				Interesting Pine...<br /><br />I dont have a direct thought to your statement. Im still wrapping my head around How and PINE if you will cause the time iv been here you are the only one i will except knowledge from and have fulll faith in it. <br /><br />HOW THE FUK IS IT POSSIBLE TO DOS, LET ALONE DDOS A FUCKING ONION SITE? how?? YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTNETS FIRIING OR THOUSAND OF PEOPLE FIRING AT ONE IP IF IM NOT WRONG, HOW CAN THAT BE DONE ON TOR WHEN THE IPS CHANGE EVERYTIME U LOG ON..??? DOS AND DDOS ARE NOT THE EXACT SAME THING.. I agree with the poster allot about his comments on this was a SQL injection i believe that more than i do the TOR NET WORK WAS DDOS OR DOS! NO fucking way.. Pine u truly feel that is possible? <br /><br />I lurk and read more than anyting, and im allot more up on computer prgraming, and the other little fun things you learn over the years. I just don feel the need to post on everyting.<br /><br />Just seeing these ppl Thinking it was A DDOS OR DOS just baffle s me.. Ok yea DPR said that was the attack, HELLO!!! THAT DOENT MEAN THAT WAS THE TRUE REASON BEHIND WHY WE WERNT GETTING ON..<br /><br />To me its clear as the day there is way more here going on than just SR and buying drugs as well as selling.. There is a Hidden hand in all this.. Open your 3rd eye, LOOK,LISTEN AND LEARN!! For those who dont understand what your 3rd eye is, = your Pinal Gland.&lt;Sorry if i splt it wrong. <br /><br />Any thoughts Pine? or others? This DDOS-DOS IS BS

				You don&#039;t target the service, you target the meetup points that the service uses.<br /><br />A hostile client can create a circuit that goes through the targeted relay more than once, so they send one packet and the tor network repeats the attack for you.<br /><br />The Tor team closed the bug on this issue with a statement along the lines of &quot;all services can be dosed so why fix it&quot;. A bit short sighted.<br /><br />There are proposed solutions, but they require changes to the protocol.

Overwrite wallet.dat on machine. This is secure, it is just awkward. <br /><br />Alternatively if physical intrusion is your main concern encrypt the wallet.dat file and then make an anonymous account at several websites that allow persistent uploads. Then you just need to protect the password username pairs and urls e.g. keepass account info storage.<br /><br />If you&#039;re concerned about bitcoin theft by malware then make a dual boot for Linux to carry out all this activity on.
