				I have had deliveries sit in Customs for days on end before. It&#039;s not unusual. If they are planning a Controlled Delivery, they wouldn&#039;t be delaying it&#039;s delivery to the point where your getting suspicious because of the delay. They would want it shipped to you in the time it usually takes so it doesn&#039;t arouse your suspicions. Customs is up and down with the time it takes to clear an item. Sometimes there busy, other times there not. If your really concerned, clear your place of anything incriminating and see how it plays out.&nbsp; ;D

				you&#039;re as safe as you make yourself to be. i&#039;d consider it suspicious, and take no chances because i&#039;ve never been in the slammer and don&#039;t plan on it any time soon. <br /><br />clear your house, you know nothing, you say nothing. accept NOTHING from anyone, but if something is left there on it&#039;s own accord. let it sit as long as you can before grabbing it. write return to sender, and just wait it out as long as you can. expending their resources is the key, as if they&#039;re going to act on it, they need to catch you red handed (at least where i&#039;m considering you&#039;re from)

				If you ordered a small amount (for personal use only), it seems unlikely to me that you&#039;ll be set up with a controlled delivery. If it gets intercepted, it will be confiscated and maybe your address will be blacklisted. And that will be the end of it.<br /><br />If you ordered a big amount, say a few bricks of C, that you plan to further distribute, then it is much more likely that they&#039;ll try to catch you, hoping to bust an entire drug ring.<br /><br />So it will mainly depend on the size of the shipment, and possibly also on the strictness of the country you reside in.

				Wouldn&#039;t they have tried a CD before your delivery date or on and not have it wait till you&#039;re delayed enough to be suspicious and clean house?&nbsp; Not quite sure how this works.&nbsp; What if you just don&#039;t pick up the package at all lol.... assuming you sent it to a box, they&#039;ll investigate the owner of that box.

				If it helps, I&#039;ve had an item sit in customs for about 20 days and everything was fine and no CD. <br />I even waited another few weeks before opening to make sure it weren&#039;t a CD.

				The whole purpose and back bone of a CD is the stealthiness of them &quot;opening and scanning&quot; your packages.<br />They have to make it look like it hasn&#039;t been opened.. obviously. Or you would be suspicious and not accept/sign for it.<br />AND.. like a few others said, if they really wanna CD you, they want it to get there either FAST or ON TIME.. so you&#039;ll be like &quot;Hell yah! Smooth transaction! Ding ding!&quot; But really they are the ones saying &quot;Ding ding ding.&quot;<br /><br />BUT, if you&#039;re not &#039;sposed to sign for it, then don&#039;t.<br />It doesn&#039;t matter if you &quot;know or do not know&quot; what is inside of the package. If you sign for it, you&#039;re claiming it. Game over. No continues.<br /><br /><br />Hope this information helped any and everyone out. Please be safe out there on this Silk Road. :)<br /><br />In body and mind,<br />Jah.

If LE gets a chance to arrest somebody on a minor possession charge, they will certainly do it. However there is a limit to the amount of effort they are willing to put in it.<br /><br />I do not know this for sure, but I expect they won&#039;t spend hundreds of man-hours on getting somebody convicted on a lesser charge (unless they maybe want to make a bigger point to the public). <br /><br />There is an interesting book out on this subject, it&#039;s called: &quot;arrest-proof yourself&quot;, written by an ex-cop. I highly recommend it. He tells how cops have a point system (in their head); the more years they can get somebody convicted, the more points it is worth to them, and the more effort they are willing to put in it.<br /><br />The truth is, nobody is safe. If the US government really wants you, they&#039;re gonna get you. They caught Bin Laden, they caught Saddam Hussein. It is most unfortunate, but they also caught Sabu, the Lulzsec frontman. He is an expert in digital security. If you are important enough, they will get you.<br /><br />But there is a moral to this story. The key to not getting caught is two-fold; be secure and be unimportant. If catching you is too difficult, and the crime is not serious enough, they will spend their limited resources on other cases.

				Who gives a toss whether they are LE or not. They don&#039;t know who you are, they don&#039;t know where you live and fact is they gave some pretty good advice. <br /><br />I read about people who say &quot;don&#039;t worry man, it&#039;s not an ounce or anything, they won&#039;t even give a shit about you.&quot;<br /><br />Reality is you are breaking the law and doing so opens you to the possibility of being caught. Complacency will fuck you up.
