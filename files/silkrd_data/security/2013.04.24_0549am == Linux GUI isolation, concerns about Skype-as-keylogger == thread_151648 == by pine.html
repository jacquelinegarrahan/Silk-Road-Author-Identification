				I think this deserves some press/commentary in general. Also I&#039;m concerned in particular that popular VOIP such as Skype, is a security threat, as I believe it is being possibly (suspicions, not proof) used as a tool for mass surveillance&nbsp; or that at the very least there are huge security concerns with it. Mostly because it is assumed to be safe by many users to talk about SR using it, or to leave it running while on SR, and all the signs suggest anything but.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think this is ridiculous until you&#039;ve read through the links.<br /><br />First off: <br /><br />http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.fi/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> The Linux Security Circus: On GUI isolation<br />There certainly is one thing that most Linux users don&#039;t realize about their Linux systems... this is the lack of GUI-level isolation, and how it essentially nullifies all the desktop security. I wrote about it a few times, I spoke about it a few times, yet I still come across people who don&#039;t realize it all the time.<br /><br />So, let me stress this one more time: if you have two GUI applications, e.g. an OpenOffice Word Processor, and a stupid Tetris game, both of which granted access to your screen (your X server), then there is no isolation between those two apps. Even if they run as different user accounts! Even if they are somehow sandboxed by SELinux or whatever! None, zero, null, nil!<br /><br />The X server architecture, designed long time ago by some happy hippies who just thought all the people apps are good and non-malicious, simply allows any GUI application to control any other one. No bugs, no exploits, no tricks, are required. This is all by design. One application can sniff or inject keystrokes to another one, can take snapshots of the screen occupied by windows belonging to another one, etc.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t believe me, I suggest you do a simple experiment. Open a terminal window, as normal user, and run xinput list, which is a standard diagnostic program for Xorg (on Fedora you will likely need to install it first: yum install xorg-x11-apps):<br /><br />$ xinput list<br /><br />It will show you all the pointer and keyboard devices that your Xorg knows about. Note the ID of the device listed as “AT keyboard” and then run (as normal user!):<br /><br />$ xinput test id<br /><br />It should now start displaying the scancodes for all the keys you press on the keyboard. If it doesn&#039;t, it means you used a wrong device ID.<br /><br />Now, for the best, start another terminal window, and switch to root (e.g. using su, or sudo). Notice how the xinput running as user is able to sniff all your keystrokes, including root password (for su), and then all the keystrokes you enter in your root session. Start some GUI app as root, or as different user, again notice how your xinput can sniff all the keystrokes you enter to this other app!<br /><br />Yes, I can understand what is happening in your mind and heart right now... Don&#039;t worry, others have also passed through it. Feel free to hate me, throw out insults at me, etc. I don&#039;t mind, really (I just won&#039;t moderate them). When you calm down, continue reading.<br /><br />In Qubes the above problem doesn&#039;t exist, because each domain (each AppVM) has it own local, isolated, dummy X server. The main X server, that runs in Dom0 and that handles the real display is never exposed to any of the AppVMs directly (AppVMs cannot connect to it via the X protocol). For details see this technical overview.<br /><br />You can repeat the same experiment in Qubes. You just need to use the ID of the “qubesdev” device, as shown by xinput list (should be 7). Run the xinput in one of your domains, e.g. in the “red” one. Because we actually use the same device for both mouse and keystrokes, you should now see both the key scancodes, as well as all the mouse events. Notice how your xinput is able to sniff all the events that are destined for other apps belonging to the same domain where you run xinput, and how it is unable to sniff anything targeted to other domains, or Dom0.<br /><br />BTW, Windows is the only one mainstream OS I&#039;m aware of, that actually attempts to implement some form of GUI-level isolation, starting from Windows Vista. See e.g. this ancient article I wrote in the days when I used Vista at my primary laptop. Of course, it&#039;s still easy to bypass this isolation, because of the huge interface that is exposed to each GUI client (that also includes GPU API). Nevertheless, they at least attempt to prevent this at the architecture level.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Crossposting from another thread in which this topic came up:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1035664#msg1035664">Quote from: pine on April 20, 2013, 10:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1035485#msg1035485">Quote from: tree on April 20, 2013, 08:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=150018.msg1035400#msg1035400">Quote from: pine on April 20, 2013, 08:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or you could have LE spyware on your machine logging your keystrokes.

				Skype is a huge security concern for many reasons, you&#039;re forced to use a proxy to keep any of your information secure via skype.&nbsp; Never connect to anyone on skype unless proxied.<br /><br />

				ALL major desktop windowing systems have no isolation between GUI windows. If any one of your applications is pwnt, EVERYTHING can be keylogged. There are defenses though, you can use virtual machines like Qubes does, or you can use things like SELinux sandboxes. There are other techniques as well. Desktop OS&#039;s with windowed applications have long been considered insecure, this is one of the main reasons why. On the other hand who wants to do everything from command line. Qubes is a good step in the right direction, I haven&#039;t been using it myself but I do use multiple virtual machines and keep what I run on the host to the bare minimum.

				I&#039;m a founding member of &quot;Just Say NO to Skype.&quot;&nbsp; I think I&#039;m the only member though... but we&#039;re still taking applications!<br /><br />To be serious: uhhh... this comes as a surprise to people?&nbsp; It&#039;s a layered architecture, basically: if the first layer doesn&#039;t catch a keystroke, it gets passed on.&nbsp; Usually to the active window.&nbsp; That&#039;s how hotkeys work.&nbsp; I mean if X didn&#039;t catch your hotkey before it reached the active window, it would be the active window&#039;s job to implement that.&nbsp; Along with half of the shit that X actually does, every single program would need to know how to replace that functionality.<br /><br />That&#039;s ludicrous.&nbsp; Which is why it&#039;s not how modern operating systems are designed.

				Skype is a closed source application that is now controlled by a corporation that openly works with LE and provides tools like this:<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Online_Forensic_Evidence_Extractor<br /><br />You should put zero trust in Skype. You should not do anything sensitive on the same computer/OS where Skype is installed. If for some reason you need to use Skype, do your sensitive stuff in Tails or on a separate computer.<br />

It is unnecessary to involve a supernode because they have your plaintext (which is why &quot;logging&quot; is the right word vs &quot;intercept&quot;), although they have access to your session keys too if need be, and basically all manner of data is vacuumed out of your machine and into theirs.<br /><br />Like I have already said, I cannot know whether they are using Skype for mass surveillance, although this is to me a far from unlikely possibility.

Actually it would be quite brilliant if a special keyboard came with a one time pad key length, of even 50mb would be more than enough. Then you could have &quot;paired keyboards&quot;. It would be 100% unbreakable instant messaging communication then. You don&#039;t have to trust the machine you&#039;re working with. A real boon in a conflict environment or where there is a mole. I bet this has already been done somewhere. You&#039;d still have to secure the keyboard though, to prevent unsought out &#039;upgrades&#039;.<br /><br />Only problem would be you wouldn&#039;t detect when you make spelling mistakes :D<br /><br />And since you have to distribute keyboards everywhere, it&#039;s not really practical for us. Could be good for spies or military though. It&#039;s a pretty constrained usecase.<br /><br />
