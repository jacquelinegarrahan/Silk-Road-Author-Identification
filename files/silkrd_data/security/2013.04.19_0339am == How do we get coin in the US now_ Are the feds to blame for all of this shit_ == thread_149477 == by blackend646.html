				I breathed a sigh of relief upon finding Bitfloor after Bitme went down, and then of course Bitfloor goes down a month later. How do I go about purchasing coin now? I&#039;m not comfortable waiting 2-5 days to complete a transaction with some overseas exchange. <br /><br />Are the pigs behind the recent closure of all of these bitcoin exchanges? If so, are we pretty much boned?

				One word .. liquidity. We are lucky anyone survived the huge runup last week. Cash flow is the reason most businesses go bust and last week would have severely tested the cashflow of most exchanges.

				Last poster is right.&nbsp; Look at the bitcoins for cash vendors .&nbsp; They had it bad. <br /><br />Don&#039;t forget about Canada. They have a large exchange there you can buy from.&nbsp; &nbsp;The ATM machines are coming soon.

				BitInstant seems to have fixed their problems. I used it yesterday with very quick processing and no issues; however, other users have still reported problems. If you are desperate for a quick transaction then I say go for BitInstant, just don&#039;t exchange more money than you are willing to lose in transition for a while (just in case).

				blue sky traders have been great for US transactions. fast and very reasonable fee per coin. the only bummer now is that they no longer confirm to tormail accounts because they have been having a lot of issues with emails not making it through. they have my vote all the way though

				I suggest everyone STOPS recommending Bitinstant because it is seriously going to get some people fucked. People have reported lost money transactions and given the run around by Bitinstant so STOP suggesting them. If anything just warn people and suggest elsewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;m not risking my $2300 with Bitinstant. It&#039;s going through I guess...blockchain :/ never used them but I sure as hell dont want to pay $10 extra PER coin like bitcopia.com is doing.

				well i am not sure you can check with your county if the feds are to blame in regards to the management of sewage facilities. you can get coins by going to a bank or shop and giving them notes. if you buy a drink and give you a 20 they will give you change and some of it will be coins.<br /><br />as for your last message i think we bone pork, it doesnt bone us. get educated on the way pork is made. europe might have horse meat in its human food but no pigs are boning humans in abattoirs yet. no reports of human boned peices found in supermarkets ive seen on the news..<br /><br />whats an exchange?<br /><br />why cant i buy silk at this joint?<br /><br />
