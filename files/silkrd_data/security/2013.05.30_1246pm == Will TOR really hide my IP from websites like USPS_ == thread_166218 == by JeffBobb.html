				Hello everyone,<br /><br />scenario - say Im using TOR to go to USPS website, I create a fake account so that I can&#039;t print my own postage at home.&nbsp; Will TOR really hide my IP from USPS??&nbsp; I know onion sites don&#039;t record, but will regular http websites, or for that matter, Government websites such as USPS still be able to see the routed IP or my real IP??&nbsp; Any info or experiences will be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!!

				If you use Tor it will come up with the Tor exit-node IP and hide your IP.<br />You can test it out by going to www.whatismyip.com from your Tor browser and your regular browser. <br /><br />Some people don&#039;t advise tracking mail and what not through Tor because they reckon some sites might look for specific Tor IP&#039;s. <br /><br />Also usually all websites will log your IP (or your Tor IP) and every page you access, picture you see, and probably every label you create or what ever it is you are doing.&nbsp; same with Onion sites but&nbsp; the IP comes up as 127.0.0.1 so they can&#039;t tell who is who in the logs.

				Do not use Tor with anything to do with USPS. Your IP and transactions will get flagged. Plus, I do not think you can use click and ship if you are on TOR.

				Im not talking about click n ship or trying to track this mail at all or even&nbsp; shipping packages.&nbsp; Im shipping envelopes - business mail style, no stamps, but printed postage where the stamps would normally go - like utility bills we all get - USPS, or Stamps.com offers a service where you can simply do this from your home printer, so my question was, if I was to do it this way, would TOR still mask my IP or would there be a way for them to see the real IP?&nbsp; Ive got onto USPS and stamps.com before with TOR, just to look around, and had no problems - just wondering if I actually signed up for a dummy account and tried to do it if it would work???<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Do not use TOR with anything related to USPS or any mailing service for that matter. Is that a solid enough answer for you? I am just trying to help, no offense.
