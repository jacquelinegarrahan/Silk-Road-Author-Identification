				I fall short of your 250 transaction criteria and cannot handle your entire amount. But I would be able to help you on a portion of it.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/014e116d7f<br /><br />There is my listing for Bitcoin to $$$ transactions if you are interested.<br /><br />Good luck either way.

				even with the max order of 8 it would help a little but we are looking for one transaction.<br /><br />As far as the 250 transactions go I was referring to my account not what you had to have lol.<br /><br />As long as you are a reputable vendor and are a trusted forum member I am ok with it.<br /><br />OR if anyone would be willing to tell me if localbitcoins.com is actually safe getting my btc from the road to my personal btc wallet let me know<br /><br />Thanks

				I completely understand. I could bump it up to 12 at the moment, but that will still fall short of your needs. Typically once I have bitcoin, getting cash goes fast. But again, I understand you want to knock out one single transaction. <br /><br />If I can be of help or if you can&#039;t figure anything out, let me know and I can do what I can.

				Your landlord is requiring $2000 down payment on a Sunday on a holiday weekend? The banks being closed that seems like an unreasonable expectation anyway.. Tell them to give you till Tuesday when the banks are open.

				@Anonyguy - Ha! Where do you read that? There are far quicker methods of transmitting funds than sending cash by mail.
