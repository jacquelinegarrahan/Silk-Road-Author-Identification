				You&#039;re limited to the amount you can buy but here are the two fastest services that I use.<br /><br />btcquick.com - lets you buy bitcoins from your google wallet (usually credit card attached to account). Initially it&#039;ll let you buy only $250 worth of coins, but it&#039;s done and sent to my SR wallet within an hour usually. Once you reach a certain number of transactions, you will be upgraded to a higher level account and you can buy more.<br /><br />quickbt.com - lets you buy up to 0.3/0.4 of bitcoins through online banking. I think this may only be a Canadian thing though.<br /><br />Just stock up and let them sit until you have enough. I can&#039;t say which place is best for larger bulk amounts though. Cavirtex (who I was doing business with before) has made it so difficult to get bitcoins fast (usually having to wait at least 4-5 business days now) that I don&#039;t deal with them anymore.

				If the cards are prepaid cards bought with cash that is still fairly anon.&nbsp; You would only have to worry about cameras at the store. im not sure but I guess someone could link your purchase of the card to camera footage. You don&#039;t want to buy coins with a real card or bank account even if bitcoins are legal right now.

				Walk into the bank&#039;s lobby and look for the kiosk where you can grab a small stack of blank Deposit Slips.<br />Then fill out the slip with the vendor&#039;s info and use the drive-thru to deposit the money into their account.<br />Again, there&#039;s sure to be cameras, but LocalBitCoins might just be as anonymous as it gets.

				If you&#039;re good with doing bank transfer, then why not just do cash deposit into the buyers account? No ID required; just complete the deposit slip with the vendors acct number and name. Done. Or cash in the mail, or cash in person (if feasible) - cash is the best way to buy!

				localbitcoins.com, buy face-to-face from a local bitcoin miner.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sacrifice your identity to the system by playing on the bank and credit card institution&#039;s field.
