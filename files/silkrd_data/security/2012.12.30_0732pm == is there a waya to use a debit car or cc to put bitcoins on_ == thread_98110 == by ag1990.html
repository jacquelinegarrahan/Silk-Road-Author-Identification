				No.&nbsp; The issue is that a bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed.&nbsp; No matter what the circumstances are -- nobody has that power.&nbsp; You can give them back, but you can&#039;t undo the transaction.<br /><br />Accept payment in forms other than cash, and you get tons of people claiming fraud and canceling the payments after they get their bitcoins -- since there&#039;s nothing that can be done about it after that.

				Generally no. Too much chargeback fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so there&#039;s too much risk in getting scammed. Cash deposits and bank transfers are the most common ways to get bitcoins.

				What these members told you is all 100% , though there is ways to get your BTC through a purchase with some kind of plastic, a cc or debit card... only its like the single biggest bread crumb you can begin your &#039;paper&#039; trial with. Shit even bank transfer to mtGox is like a no no in the community, amongst those who make place serious orders anyway, or just the pnoiders lol.<br /><br />&nbsp;Bitinstant cash deposit, to either BTC addy..I wouldnt even suggest BTC to email if its not a tormail addy, and still not even lol. Just keep as safe as possible friend. Good luck. 8)
