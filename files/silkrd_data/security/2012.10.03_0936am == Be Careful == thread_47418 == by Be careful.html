				This warning is not very credible on its face.&nbsp; The claimed inside information (&quot;mass early morning raids&quot;) is not consistent with the OP&#039;s the advice (&quot;do not use your bank details for any transactions&quot;).&nbsp; If indeed there were imminent mass raids, the more reasonable and correct advice would be along the lines of &quot;clean fucking house and cover your ass.&quot;&nbsp; If raids are about to go down, it&#039;s a little late for advice about bitcoin transactions and bank account info.&nbsp; Just an observation, FWIW.<br />

Buying BTC is legal if you get back it up in court. Currently, the federal government classifies BTC as a &quot;virtual currency&quot; and a money laundering scheme. When you keep records and pay taxes--as is required for all US citizens, then there is nothing illegal about it. If nothing else, you can record everything as a &quot;loss&quot; until the Fedz get their bookkeeping practices up to date: Every bitcoin transaction is registered and secured by the US government and by every bitcoin miner. Don&#039;t you know how BTC works?<br /><br />BTC is secure because of the complexity of the transactions. When you transfer money into BTC, you are essentially buying stock. Money you make--and everything is tracked by Big Brother, within reason--is reportable, whether through drugs money or legitimate services. Al Capone was jailed for tax evasion--NOT BOOTLEGGING or Murder.<br /><br />So, BTC is not illegal if you follow the laws. There is no law outlawing the use of virtual currencies, unless it is to shirk payment to the IRS.
