				I&#039;m really curious what good Not for human consumption rules are that some RC vendors have on here. It makes sense for forums where NFHC is enforced sitewide but on SR you list your products NFHC or otherwise under the drug/ecstasy/etc. It&#039;s pretty clear by the clear purpose of the site and the categories that it is intended for consumption. I label all products as NFHC to add some protection to the buyer if anything is intercepted in the mail but don&#039;t see a use for NHFC on listings. Thoughts?

				It&#039;s because most RC are legal (or not regulated yet), selling it for human consumption is illegal. I think shipping it without the material safety data sheet is not so legal too because it is normally required by law but who care right ?

				Yep many RCs are in the grey area falling under the analogue act which can be very hard to prosecute with. However just saying not for human consumption does not necessarily give you a free pass. There has been a lot of talk that if you are selling small quantities (small enough to be a couple doses) that alone can be used to show that you meant to sell it for consumption. Putting in in pills or any other obvious for consumption form hurts your case a lot too. So with that logic I&#039;d assume that just by selling on SR in the drug category you throw away the NFHC loophole.

				They write that on all &quot;legal&quot; drugs, morning glory seeds or Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds&nbsp; have this wrote on the bag if you buy them at Iamshaman shop, they are normally for planting not for consuming by humans. RC can be purchased to do &quot;lab experiments&quot; normally on rats then on a bigger animal, etc. But the NFHC tag means it has not been tested on humans yet (at least not officially) and that the danger are unknown for use by humans.

				I worry about the possible longterm side effects of taking RCs. No one knows! We&#039;re only just finding out the long term side effects of K abuse (bladder control). <br />At least with the other &#039;proper&#039; drugs people have been using them for decades if not hundreds of years. The long term side effects are known and we can make informed choices.<br />Even when some drugs go through the really long and extensive testing period of medical drugs, they can still through up some horrendous unforeseen side effects (thermidamide (sp?) babies for just one example). I truly believe it&#039;s up to the individual what they put in their bodies, but as adults we should be making informed decisions. If you want to be the first guinea-pig then go ahead, I&#039;m not stopping you, just be aware.

				In fact i think governments if they can, may want to write NFHC on every known drug (but as a drug dealer you don&#039;t want to write that on that lovely coke bag, no ?).. but if this worry you too much you should stay with known drugs ..

				I meant more along the lines of vendor safety. If a vendor is selling RC for consumption it may be possible to prosecute them under the analogue act. So vendors try to counter this by stating their products are not for consumption. My concern is that just by selling on SR in the drug section it renders the NFHC tag useless in the eyes of a jury. It they can show that you are clearly selling it for consumption despite the label it would seem you are just as screwed as having no label at all.<br /><br />Mainly it seems like the NFHC label may give some vendors a false sense of security and lead them to get sloppier than if they were selling a schedule I substance.<br /><br />Obviously just about all NFHC labels on RC are just for show and the buyers intend to take the risk and use them but from a legal perspective Im curious how much the label helps especially on a site like SR openly selling black market drugs right next to the RCs. Or on any site for that matter. It cant be that hard to convince a jury that the guy with 100&#039;s of baggies of psychoactive substances intended it for consumption and that his clients are not conducting academic research of any kind.<br /><br />False sense of security?

However I would wager that the ones still around are taking many security measures other than a simple NFHC. I just dont know that it would hold up in court.<br /><br />Of course it does not hurt to tag all RCs with NFHC but I&#039;m just curious if anyone with legal background knows if it would help ones case when selling on a site that is clearly purposed for buying/selling and using drugs. From what I can see it would be extremely hard to convince&nbsp; a jury that you were not aware that the buyers of SR intended to consume the chems.<br /><br />Surely does not hurt to use NFHC but is it a false sense of security that could results in vendors getting sloppy?
