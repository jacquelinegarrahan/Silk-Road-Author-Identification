				Hi,<br />i`ve got one question: imagine somebody has bought BTC anonymously (for example via cash) and the BTC are transferred to his client. Now he is using his home PC to administer his BTC (maybe for transferring BTC to SR). Don`t you think, that LE is able find out, which IP made which transfer? If they have your IP, they have your name... ?<br /><br />wright or wrong?<br />thx

				What you describe is certainly possible, which is why it&#039;s recommended to run your BTC client over Tor.&nbsp; Then there&#039;s no way for anyone to know whose wallet it is.

				How do you run the client with Tor?<br /><br />I have installed a Tor-bundle-browser. It looks just like the usual firefox, only difference is, that you have a green onion in the right bottom, you see a green sign that says &quot;tor enabled&quot; an that it is slow as fuck.<br /><br />As far as i know, the client is just a program, that connects on his own to the internet. so how can I put these two things together? Am i already protected, when the green onion can be seen in the right bottom?<br /><br />

				No its not enough just have tor open, I personally feel this single step should be absoutley used by all SR users...a sticky perhaprs? Very important. <br /><br />Do it like this:<br /><br />Once you have your Tor client up &amp; running, you can configure your Bitcoin client to use it.<br />Select in menu Settings -&gt; Options<br /><br />Check &quot;Connect through socks 4 proxy&quot; with the address 127.0.0.1 and port 9050 (the Tor default port number)<br /><br />You can check to make sure this is working by clicking on Vidalia Control Panel, and click &quot;stop tor&quot; this should make your connections on your client go to zero.

IP addresses are not recorded in bitcoin blocks. only wallet IDs.<br /><br />Guys, do not be paranoid, LEs are not monitoring TOR and/or Bitcoin networks for illegal activity. They barely just figured out how to tap into Gnutella and few other P2P networks to look for perverts.

Unless you centralize them like Kazaa, Napster, Limewire and all of those other shitcanned P2P ideas that got scooped <br /><br />up by LE. Bitcoin and Silk Road are light years ahead of this and were made to avoid this.<br /><br />Lets not forget FaggotBay and IsoCunt, who serve as examples as to what can happen to P2P when it&#039;s exposed on a shitty torrent tracker. <br /><br />They become either government - run after takeover, and / or changed to useless sites with jack shit on <br /><br />them. Domain seizure is where they know they can start. No domains on Tor.<br /><br />fuck the NSA.<br /><br />ï£¿L75
