				So, I&#039;m about to buy some BTC directly from the road w/ a cash deposit and it&#039;s the last time I want to have to do that due to high fees. Since Bitinstant has decided to take a complete crap (despite their protestations that it&#039;s fixed), I need options on the best ways to get BTC now. Gracias.

				Depends where you are. It&#039;s hard to offer suggestions when we don&#039;t know what country you are in.

				If you are in the USA ....and you need more then $800 worth of btc...I am hands down the best option.<br /><br />As I have no fees at all And can get the whole process done in under 30 min.&nbsp; Also I sell you btc at the current rate on Silk road at the time of our transaction..NO mark up..no bullshit. If the btc on Silk road is worth 111.187777 then I give you 11.20. I always round up in your favor.<br /><br />&nbsp;And that is important..in that is you get $900 in btc..then you will have 900 in btc on Silk Road when when we are finished. I even cover your Western Union fees. So if you send me $850, Wu charges you$76...well I send you $926 in BTC at the current rate it is on SR...so you will get dollar for dollar with no fee&#039;s. It can be done in as quick as 20. Also I have been a vendor over a year with perfect feedback and I have been selling btc over a year with perfect feedback. That means&nbsp; ALL 5/5&#039;s.<br /><br />You can just go to:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a901074cb3<br /><br />I know that you are probably needing a smaller amount..and if so the only person I know to recommend is BlueSkyTraders.&nbsp; I am sure there are other great vendors...but I just do not know about them..so I do not mean to disrespect anyone.<br /><br />Thanks<br />RxKing

				the no fees way makes complete sense. either way, somewhere, somehow there is a fee for both parties. If a seller is making profits and can advertise something that unloads the vendors coins and makes it easier for buyers to get them. Win fucking Win in my book!

				my suggestions would be:<br />&nbsp;1. =&gt; localbitcoins.com <br />and.. <br />&nbsp;2. =&gt; try looking into the fees charged for funding an account at btc-e.com<br />btc-e.com don&#039;t require ID.<br /><br />When you eventually get your bitcoins.. try sending me a satoshi.<br />I still don&#039;t know if that&#039;s possible.<br /><br />Finally .. a Mr Spock joke.&nbsp; (of Star Trek)<br /><br />&quot;So, Mr Spock.. i hear you&#039;re half human, half vulcan&quot;<br />&quot;Yes, that is correct&quot;.<br />&quot;So do you think you&#039;ve gained the best from both species&quot;<br />&quot;Negative.. vulcan men have solid 10&quot; penises, vulcan women have pointy ears.&nbsp; I&#039;m vulcan on my mother&#039;s side.&quot; <br /><br />come on.. that&#039;s worth a karma point :-)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you&#039;re having trouble with Bitinstant try using your real info, or if you can&#039;t or don&#039;t want to, use someone elses. You just have to know their full name, and address. I made up a phone number and failed the verification quiz and got 2 orders in yesterday and both were delivered to my SR wallet in under an hour
