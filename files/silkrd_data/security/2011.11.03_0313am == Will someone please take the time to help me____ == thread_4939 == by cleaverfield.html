				Check out get-bitcoin.com. You can make a cash deposit and have it deposited to the bitcoin address of your choice. I recommend using instawallet.org then transferring from there to SR. Should be relatively easy as long as you have a wells fargo bank in or near your town. (I am assuming you are in the US, otherwise I am not sure how to go about getting btc.)

				With respect, I was in your position just 2-3 weeks ago and I found out how to do it all in a day or two. The info is out there. Don&#039;t be afraid to look!

				MtGox also takes deposits at Chase bank branches, and all that is required is a form from the site to be filled out - no ID or anything.<br /><br />USD shows up in a couple of hours and you can exchange for bitcoin in seconds.&nbsp; From there it&#039;s a few hours wait to transfer over to SR (I would recommend sending to an external wallet first).<br /><br />if it&#039;s weed you want............................. ;)

Gox cash deposits via Chase seem to take between 3 hours, and 5 days... depends on the day of the week. I&#039;ve only had one out of three deposits go through within 1 business day.

				Good to know - most of what I&#039;ve heard is that it&#039;s pretty quick, but I have also heard that it is only quick if you get your deposit in early in the business day.
