				Its been a few months since I last used SR so I was wondering if Blockchain is safe to use again?&nbsp; Or if there is anything similar to blockchain that I can use to get bitcoins?<br /><br />I never really learned how to use bitinstant along with mtgox...<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				My favorite is BST. Their onion site is: http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />They are great to deal with and reliable. Though, these days it is hard to get an order in with them quickly as they are overfilled with orders.<br /><br />I also would recommend bitinstant. I have used them before and it has been nice and easy. They had some issues a little while back, but that all seems to be resolved. Have recently heard more positive things about their service. <br /><br />Both of these will just send coins to a BTC address. So setup a separate wallet and send there, or just send to SR.&nbsp; I would recommend having another wallet though.

				Sorry to scare you guys, but I remember a few months ago not recently blockchain got messed up and it took a few weeks or so to recover.&nbsp; But I might be mistaking it with Bitfloor... Sorry for the confusion!&nbsp; <br />I just used Blockchain today and was able to get my precious from tessellated =)&nbsp;

				Blockchain is perfectly fine and safe. <br /><br />I suggest not using their browser-based website though. From my understanding the add-on version they have for free that works with Firefox/Chrome is much safer against attacks/etc.
