This is nothing against the OP of this thread, just a general comment. There are many people who really need to take the time to read through and familiarize themselves with the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of using Tor correctly and safely. I think some people think you just download Tor and log on to Silk Road and away you go, not realizing how easy it is to make mistakes which could potentially reveal your true I.P.address and in essence, your anonymity.

				I assume you&#039;re talking about using tor with firefox, and at the same time using that other browser but not through tor. Is this correct?<br /><br />I think this is possible. But I&#039;d be very nervous about doing that. Isn&#039;t it possible that an adversary may somehow correlate connections with tor on firefox with simultaneous connections on the clearnet using your ISP? And wouldn&#039;t that make revealing the IP of the tor user relatively easy?<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m full of it, but as I said, that&#039;s very dangerous from my perspecvtive.<br /><br />goblin

				Yeah as long as you are NOT accessing any of sites your normally would through TOR like bank info, e-mail (except for TOR mail) and anything else. Then its fine to run those browsers, just keep in mid to be separate.&nbsp;

				I run Tor on &quot;Tails&quot; and I have not tried to run a clearnet browser at the same time as I do not want to allow what I think of as anti-privacy applications (java/flash/...) permission to run while I&#039;m in Tails. Clearnet browsing would seem to require such applications at every turn? I don&#039;t know if I am being more careful than I need to be?
