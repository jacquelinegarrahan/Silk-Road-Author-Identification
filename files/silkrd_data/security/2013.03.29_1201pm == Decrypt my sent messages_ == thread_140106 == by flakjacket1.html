Create an encrypted container on your hard drive (using something like Truecrypt) and save the message there in cleartext before you encrypt it to your addressee.<br /><br />EDIT: The IP exposure I mentioned is an error. My apologies. There is an exposure problem that can occur when self-signing a key, as far as I remember, though it&#039;s not clear that even this is a &quot;real&quot; problem instead of paranoia, but this has nothing to do with encrypting with keys. I&#039;m not entirely clear about the technical details, so I suppose I should have reserved my comments. However I think I&#039;m correct in expecting a courteous response when I ask for clarification. I don&#039;t mind being corrected; that&#039;s how we learn. So relax. I got my wires crossed, there&#039;s no call for hand wringing.&nbsp; 8)

Someone in another thread recommended cashing out BTC by direct bank transfer. No offense, but you all have a lot to learn before you start giving advice in Security.<br /><br />ladyjane, the only security threat is if your private key is compromised, the adversary could read the messages you sent to others. Of course, he could read the messages they sent and encrypted to you, even when you don&#039;t encrypt to yourself, and probably reconstruct the other half of the conversation anyway.<br /><br />I encrypt most messages to myself so I can remind myself of what I wrote, which I forget sometimes.<br />

(EDIT: please disregard the following, I learnt that I&#039;m wrong. I hate being wrong... The part about subductionzone not knowing what he&#039;s talking about it still true tho) You cannot encrypt you message to yourself &#039;as well&#039; (you can make a copy of your message, encrypt it with your own key, and save it for later if you don&#039;t want to lose it). You can only encrypt it using ONE public key (the one on the vendors page usually). It can be decrypted with the corresponding private key (a key on the vendors harddrive/usbstick/whatever, which no-one else has access too. The private key is protected by a password as well). If you encrypt your message with your vendors public key, only your vendor can decrypt it. If you encrypt it with your own public key, only you can decrypt it. Also, your IP is not &#039;embedded&#039; in your encrypted message. That&#039;s, as I mentioned before, bullshit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140106.msg953910#msg953910">Quote from: astor on March 29, 2013, 02:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ladyjane, the only security threat is if your private key is compromised, the adversary could read the messages you sent to others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not correct. To read the messages you have SENT encrypted to others (using their public key), you need the receivers private key. With your private key, you can only decrypt the messages which have been encrypted with your public key, which will be the messages you receive, not the ones you sent.<br />
