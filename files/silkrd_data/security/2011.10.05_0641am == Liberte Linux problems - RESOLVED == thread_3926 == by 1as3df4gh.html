				Hi,<br />I am having real trouble installing Liberte Linux on my usb key, does anyone on here use it and if so can you help me out please?<br />I am running Crunchbang Statler, a Debian based distro, and trying to install Liberte 2011.1 onto a 4Gb Micro SD formatted to FAT32. I have unpacked the zip so that in the root of the card I have a folder called Liberte, copied the setup.sh script to my home folder and run it thus: sh ~/setup.sh /dev/sdb1 but it always fails. Has anybody got this to work please?

				thats a top distro mate, just go to the internet caf if you dont have windows to enable you to easily install to the microsd,far easier this way than having to do it from a debian distro.

				mircosd cards with a live distro installed (any security orientated distros),is as good as it gets in my opinion and should be a must for everyone partcipating in this line of work.<br /><br />prepaid internet dongles are also the way to go, BUT.....you better make sure someone else buys the credit from the shop or else you will be on camera buying the top up for that dongle.oh and second hand dongles are essential, get em off craiglist/gumtree

				Thanks for the help all but I got it sorted in the end. I booted a live USB of Mint LXDE that I had knocking around and installed from there without a hitch.<br /><br />EVERYBODY:&nbsp; This distro is the way to go. Seriously. I have never seen anything quite as secure as this, everything is locked down. It is designed for people in hostile environments to communicate securely without risk of interception, that is EXACTLY what we need. You cant do much apart from browse and email but there is effectively no risk when using this. My main install is encrypted etc just for my peace of mind, but anything dodgy goes through Liberte now. ALL internet connections are forced through Tor, the superuser account is disabled, everything is encrypted, PGP support is built in, its perfect!<br />Installed on a microSD you really cannot go wrong with this. Mine stays hidden (very very easy to hide something 10 x 15 x 0.5mm) on my person at all times, I literally dont go anywhere without it. Short of NSA/MI6/Mossad/FSB really wanting to get into it, my shit is safe. And thats how I like it.
