				I&#039;ve been wracking my brain (and yes, it hurts just like Michael Palin&#039;s) trying to come up with a solution for people who are either not willing or just can&#039;t seem to learn PGP in order to encrypt their orders (name, address).<br /><br />The only standby solution I came up with is for them to write &quot;email&quot; in the address box in the shopping cart page and then send email to a tormail account I have. (Of course it could be any other secure non-javascript email service.) I would see the order and immediately go to tormail and read the customer&#039;s information, copy it and immediately delete it. <br /><br />No one has done this yet in an order. I have cancelled several orders of people who just wrote their name and address as is, and I sent them a courteous message asking them to either implement PGP or do that tormail thing.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pain in the rear to have to jump through hoops for people who either don&#039;t know, don&#039;t care, or simply are too lazy to take their security (and that of their vendors) seriously.<br /><br />I found a couple of places that *seem* to be alternate solutions, websites that offer instant encryption, such http://infoencrypt.com/ or http://www.encrypt-easy.com/encrypt-text.aspx, but I just don&#039;t know enough to judge whether they&#039;d be any safer than to write their address non-encrypted in the cart page.<br /><br />If any of you veterans out there who are light-years ahead of me in this department would comment on this, I think it would help all vendors, and potential customers who might be reading this too.<br /><br />goblin

				I don&#039;t see why you care really, it&#039;s only their security at risk. Anyway, I would suggest using privacybox (http://c4wcxidkfhvmzhw6.onion/). Once you make an account there, you can give them your public key and when people submit a message to you through their site it&#039;s automatically encrypted with your public key. You can then check the messages via their site or have them automatically forwarded to your email address.

				I&#039;m inclined to agree with the op on bad security compromising buyer and seller.&nbsp; While certainly no expert, I can certainly think of ways non-secured addresses could lead to bad things for all involved.&nbsp; Granted, it depends on how bad someone wants to get a particular vendor, but a non-encrypted addy is one step down a road that I wouldn&#039;t want to go were I a vendor.&nbsp; I am NOT a vendor, but if I were I would NEVER send to an unencrypted address.<br /><br />Besides, if a vendor can afford to be a little picky, then he should encourage people to learn about security for themselves.&nbsp; It&#039;s no good to have all your customers under investigation.&nbsp; I mean, is it?&nbsp; ???
