				Ok I expect a few haters for what I&#039;m about to post, specially being a newbie to both Tor hidden web, AND SR Community ( which btw I am so keen on contributing to): So I&#039;ll have to admit that being WAY to excited to carry on with my first purchase I have been extremely sloppy with my steps, however I have not yet done anything illegal hehe:<br />I downloaded Tor (with no special features added to it, just the browser bundle)<br />I purchased Bitcoins from BitPiggy (due to AUD convenience) WITHOUT using Tor (I know I&#039;m such a twat/idiot/retard)<br />.....With my own personal bank account through internet banking<br />Directly into SR bitcoin address<br /><br />Now my questions are, should I open a new SR account and send my Bitcoins to the new SR account? - <br />I know its way too late to cover up for all my sloppy mistakes but here is my rough idea of what I could do to gain back some anonymity:<br />Downloading an Ewallet client and forwarding Bitcoins to NEW SR account -or- to OLD SR account with new bitcoin address<br />As far as having purchased bitcoins with my own bank account through online banking I still haven&#039;t done anything illegal....<br />So if I have my packet delivered to a friend&#039;s house is it still relatively safe to go through with an order?<br />Some additional info is that im downunder and am unsure of how much different post works from the US....<br /><br />this is a cry out for help and am open to ALL sorts of feedback from you guys, its valued heaps

				&nbsp;BTC is anonymous in it&#039;s entire essence<br /><br />once you have them, you have them<br /><br />fuck how you get them, no one can penalize you for purchasing BTC<br /><br />who knows what you&#039;re doing with it?<br />you, your vendor, and whoever you open your big trap to<br /><br />take it easy man<br />SR and BTC currency is only in the beginning stages of what i believe will become a massive revolution<br /><br />all we have to do is keep mining BTC, keep investing BTC, keep and eye on BTC and sit back and reap the reward!<br /><br />hope that helped<br />good luck

This is why there are services (like BitCoinFog) to wash/launder/anonymize your coins.<br /><br />To the OP: if someone like an agency or an investigator were putting some time and energy into this, they could more than likely find out that some bitcoins attached to your name were sent to SR. This cannot be undone. Since SR has its own coin tumbling system, anything you do from this point should be anonymous.<br /><br />Basically, there is nothing to be gained from further shuffling your coins via wallets, multiple accounts, etc. There is something to say about getting it (the package) sent to a friend though.

				All you can see is what address was sent to where.<br />So the SR wallet would have to be seized, then they&#039;d have to magically match up all the addresses with every exchanger on earth and hope they still have records.<br /><br />Highly unlikely this will ever happen. <br />If you&#039;re just buying it doesn&#039;t matter.. only sellers have to worry about maximum anonymity when funding here<br /><br />You should also never post on these forums any private info, like where you bought your funds from. So you went from highly anonymous to not very after just admitting where you bought them. :(
