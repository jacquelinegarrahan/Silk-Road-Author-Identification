				hi to all SR users...im new user that just found this amazing friggin resource this week (never even heard about before)....<br /><br />I have been doing as much reading as i can, have downloaded and played with GPG some, but havnt quite figured out best way to handle the BTC issue yet. <br />Also--what are most doing about email address??&nbsp; using a real one, fake one, is there an email service that is anonymous?<br /><br />Any suggestions would be appreciated--im getting really anxious to make a few trades in the market ;-)

				To be fair, I&#039;d recommend searching in the future instead of posting basic questions because these questions have been asked hundreds of times before which has led to the creation of several guides and walkthroughs on various topics that are very in depth and will get you a much more thorough answer than you&#039;ll get here. Just for future notice&nbsp; :)

				Tormail is what i have seen widely recommended just as TT suggested.&nbsp; Ignore the assholes that are responding.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s a good idea to read the forums to try and find you&#039;re answer, but don&#039;t be afraid to ask the question.&nbsp; If it&#039;s so troubling to someone they should just ignore, but some have deep issues that fills them with the need to lash out at a simply polite question.&nbsp; My best advise to you moving forward would be keep your manners even when others obviously have none.
