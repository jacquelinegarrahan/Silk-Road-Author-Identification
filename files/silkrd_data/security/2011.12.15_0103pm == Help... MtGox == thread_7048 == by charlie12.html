				I know this has probably been answered a few times on here, but i cant be fucked looking, so here goes:<br /><br />As usual for me, I&#039;ve just rushed into buying some Bits (with no research) from MtGox ($300) by lodging some cash into their Japanese bank account. <br /><br />Have I just made the biggest mistake ever or is it all good and I&#039;ll have some bits to play with in a couple of days?? <br /><br />If I don&#039;t get knocked for my $300, then how the fuck do I get the Bits over to Silky from MtGox so I can purchase some mighty fine Peruvian flake?? <br /><br />Last question.. Am I totally fucking bonkers sending some random company my cash and then sending it to some American cokehead who will sniff my $$ in a night and send me fuck all??<br /><br />Thanking you in advance for your replies/reassurance and may all your illegal endeavours go well!!<br /><br />Over &amp; Out.<br /><br />Charlie12<br /><br /><br /><br />

				mtgox is reputable. Download the bitcoin client http://bitcoin.org/ and send the coins there. The file created on your computer called wallet.dat IS your money do not lose it.<br /><br />When you&#039;re ready to buy shit on SR send it from your wallet (using the bitcoin client)&nbsp; to the SR wallet address provided on your account. Each of these &quot;Sends&quot; can take anywhere from 40 minutes to longer. Usually less than an hour.<br /><br />Only buy from sellers with lots of transactions. Try to stay in escrow if at all possible--ie don&#039;t finalize early unless you really want to risk not getting your drugs.<br /><br />Enjoy.

				RUshing does not go with MT.Gox :D<br />No worries, ur cash is safe with them but it takes some time, even SEPA in Europe takes 5-6days.<br />And dont forget ur withdrawing limit.<br />MtGox is the best choice if u want to get as much BTC as possible for ur $, but it is also the slowest.<br /><br />Peace

				If you haven&#039;t already, download and install that bitcoin client dictio posted the link for, pronto.<br /><br />You need an up to date blockchain before you can process transactions, and that fucker can take a day to get caught up. Oh, it whips through the first 70k or so in nothing flat, but that&#039;s where it tricks you, and takes as long again to get to 100k, and justs drags from there until you finally get the 157k+ blocks needed to have an up to date blockchain.<br /><br />Seriously, get that shit running now.

				Wait, what is the client needed for? I&#039;ve bought BTC numerous times, MtGox normally but britcoin/intersango if I&#039;m in a hurry, I always just transfer them from there straight to my wallet on SR.
