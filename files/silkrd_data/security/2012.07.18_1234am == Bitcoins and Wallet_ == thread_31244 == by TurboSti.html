				Anyone use bitinstant and my blockchain in order to buy bitcoins anonymously? Im just curious if these are good and trusted sites to use as I did see someone post this video http://vimeo.com/44849463 on how to do everything. If there is a better or different site I should use or is more trusted etc. please send me in the right direction. Thanks

				I use BitInstant exclusively.&nbsp; I then have the coins sent with the Coinapult service (to a throw away email), have those coins sent to my Bitcoin Wallet address, then from my wallet to SR.<br /><br />This has never been an issue.&nbsp; BitInstant is very quick, I receive my order within about 5 minutes of making my purchase which I do through Moneygram at WalMart using a fake name/phone number.&nbsp; No ID ever asked for....

				haha awesome and lastly kind of stupid but if I do exactly what is in that tutorial video which seems super easy, then all should go well and just choose what type of service I want to go and exchange my money into bitcoins essentially right?

My only complaint is the part where they ask you for a phone# and they will txt you when you get your coins... I always use this with my google voice # but nothing ever comes through. Not that its that important...my coins are always waiting for me by the time I get back home.<br /><br />I filled in my real info at Walmart the first 2 times out of fear they would ask for ID, but nope, never do.

				How hard is it to set up a seller account. I am new, and know not to buy anything under this account if a seller account will be set up. I am trying to build up some bit coins. $$ is no problem, but I see how much the Addie&#039;s go for, and know I could build up some BC dumping some of them. I have plently of pharms, just need to get my bitcoins up so I can place an order. I research all these services. It is crazy, 3 weeks ago BC were 6 American, now they are 7 to 8, but product prices have not reflected. WTF??? I am a fair guy, anyone who wants to message me can. I have Addies, 20 IR and OP 40s
