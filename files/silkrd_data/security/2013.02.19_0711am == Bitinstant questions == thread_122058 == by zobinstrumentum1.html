PIN # and voila - done deal...<br /><br />If you&#039;re ordering personal amounts (I&#039;ve ordered upto a gram of H, a gram of MDMA crystals, and one OC-80) and had them all delivered directly to my address, using my real name.&nbsp; The USPS got too much going on to worry about that stuff and the vendors spend a lot of time making sure it is stealthy.<br /><br />If you&#039;re ordering mass quantities or weed - I&#039;m not too sure about, but I still think the quantity rule applies...<br /><br />Best of luck with your first purchase - let us know if you need any further help.<br /><br />~~ jshizzle23 ~~

				OK - that was simple.<br /><br />Just go to MtGox.com and setup an account - I suggest using your real info (easier to remember, if there&#039;s ever a problem and they need to verify you, then you can, if you use fake info, and you lose BTC for example, say bye-bye...<br /><br />You DO NOT have to verify your account - it just gives you higher limits (right now your limit is like 200BTC PER DAY, which I doubt you&#039;ll be doing that much business), either way, like I said, its legal to buy/sell bitcoin.<br /><br />When you go to &quot;Deposit Funds&quot; there is an option for BitInstant - when you select BI - it will give you an account number to put on the BitInstant fill-in form - no big deal!!<br /><br />The most confusing part is understanding the difference between BitInstant and ZipZap.&nbsp; If you need help with that - just let us know how you&#039;re going to pay your cash deposit (CVS, Walmart, etc...) and we can help you out...<br /><br />Thanks Scout for jumping in there - I was very surprised to see 2 responses while I was typing out my response... lol<br /><br />=)

				OK - not so simple.&nbsp; Looks like someone had some problems when they went to withdraw the funds to a BTC wallet address - they needed the account verified, so if you plan on using fake info, MtGox might be a no-go.&nbsp; Not sure if that&#039;s a one-off or something that happens consistantly - never had to deal with it.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thread about BitInstant - it looks as though the removal of the Cash Deposit -&gt; BTC Wallet Address being removed is just temporary - it was supposed to be back up yesterday, but as of now, it&#039;s still not up.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120877.0<br /><br />When are you planning on making your first transaction??&nbsp; If it is SOON, you may want to look into something called Blue Sky Traders or cryptocurrent (both are through the SR forums, I guess...)&nbsp; Blue Sky took a 4.2% fee according to one person&#039;s post and I think it said cryptocurrent was at 5%??&nbsp; Don&#039;t quote me - you&#039;d have to look into it, but I didn&#039;t want to send you down the wrong path (luckily you can&#039;t moneygram right now, or else you might be off to deposit and I&#039;d feel terrible...)<br /><br />Hope this helps..
