				I have been fiddling with gpg for a couple of days now and I still dont think i have it working.&nbsp; I am an o.k. computer user but this is definatly NOT simple.&nbsp; I think beings I am a buyer not a seller I am just going to stick with privnote if/when i need encryption.&nbsp; I have the gpg downloaded and everything but using it just does not seem to work and seems to be highly complex and cause a lot of pains in the gluteus maximi muscles.

That is lazy, and also foolish because most of us think it&#039;s even safer to send addresses plaintext through SR than to give them to privnote. <br /><br />This is not mass hysteria, the most experienced technology users in the forum universally think this is the case. Privnote is in my opinion most likely a federal honeypot now, or it will be in the future. You&#039;re going to join Club PGP instead. Look at your PM inbox soon.<br /><br />P.S. If you don&#039;t use PGP, you do get to be the subject of a witch hunt later today or tomorrow.<br />P.P.S. If you continue to use privnote, odds are good a vendor will tell you to fuck off.<br /><br />It is totally voluntary to join PGP Club. Really it is. Just like wearing your seat belt while traveling at high speeds is totally voluntary. Everybody else will think you&#039;re mental though.

				thank you so much... ill give it a belt tomorrow..<br /><br />I just had an idea for the forums.<br /><br />you know when you hit reply on a thread and the boxes come up like Subject, Message icon, then its got those 4 buttons and then all the emoticons,<br />wouldn&#039;t it be good if you can add a button on there to encrypt your text.
