				Hi, please read this, it&#039;s long but I need your help!<br /><br />I have been having an absolute fucking nightmare with uKash money.<br /><br />I have amassed about $1400USD worth. I wanted to turn it into Cash.<br /><br />I started putting the uKash money into an online betting account, I was doing this sensibly.<br /><br />I started with $200, I left it for two weeks, placed a small bet and added some of my own funds into the account. I then hit the &#039;Withdraw&#039; button after 2-3 weeks. It look as though it was processing so I did the same over the same amount of time but with $500. It all seemed fine, I saw the first $200 hit my bank account. I then added another $200 and $200 etc etc while making small bets and putting non-uKash money from my bank account into my betting account. <br /><br />I then saw the money from my betting account that went into my bank account was reversed. All of the money was back in my betting account.<br /><br />I sent them an email explaining and asking what was going on and they replied that these were irregular account transactions so they put a hold on the account and asked for me to scan and email my i.d., my bank card and a letter explaining how I obtained the uKash vouchers.<br /><br />I obtained the vouchers through the SR. I don&#039;t want them to know that, so I had to think of the best possible way I could have obtained the vouchers. I thought that if I said they were a gift, it would have been easy for me to get proof of purchases which I couldn&#039;t get. So I decided to tell them I got them through work as incentive rewards for reaching targets.<br /><br />I got an email back asking me to provide them with a letter from the department within the company I work for who issued me the vouchers. They want the letter to be letter-headed with the company logo showing a telephone number. The email said their request was perfectly within their terms and conditions under the money laundering section (essentially what I&#039;m doing..!).<br /><br />I am now considering sending them a forged letter, I&#039;m good with graphics packages so I could knock up a very professional letter to go along with their request, put my telephone number on the paper so should they call me, I pretend to be that person in the department of the company who issued me the uKash vouchers. <br /><br />However if they call my bluff I have $1400USD stuck within a betting company. If they work out the letter is faked they could take the matter elsewhere.<br /><br />What do you think I should do? Does any one have any ideas or advice?! Do you think I&#039;ve lost this cash? <br /><br />Since my troubles I have ordered a uKashout card however this takes 6 weeks to arrive. Apparently they ask for 18% anyway.<br />

				I just want to say that I think anything going from SR to your actual bank account should be thought about, <br /><br />there is a difference going from bank account to means of getting to SR because your purchasing instead of putting in money that has illegal means of it being gained, look for offshore cards or use WU or MG with fake ID never link anything from SR to your real name or US bank account you could later get screwed for it
