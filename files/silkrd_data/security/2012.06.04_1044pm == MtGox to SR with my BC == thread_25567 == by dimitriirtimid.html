				Got some coin on MtGox and honestly have zero fear of LE. How can they kill that which does not live? Everything on the net is strictly monitored and that goes triple for TOR. Crime you get away with is permitted crime. Am I as well to just direct transfer my BC from there to here? What is the standard protocol in any case?

				A few things I am confused about.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say the feds have evidence of a person or persons making a deposit on silkroad.. How does that constitute a crime?&nbsp; Silk road sells other things besides drugs.&nbsp; I think I would post plenty of non-taxable items as well so that argument can be fought in court.<br /><br />If you order wisely and have no connections to you or any of your property&nbsp; odds are they can or will not bother with you if you are nothing but the average want to get high and enjoy my football game person. If you are a kingpin and pushing keys&nbsp; and&nbsp; so many oz&#039;s a&nbsp; day they will probably try and make an example out of you to be a message to anyone who dares to sell on here or any online vender<br /><br /><br />As far as the law goes. the laws does not apply to such men and women in power. They twist and corrupt the very laws that they swear yo uphold. They do not make changes cause changing such things would strip them of their power. <br /><br />If they want to lock you up they will. If you broke a law or not. Especially if you appear to be an easy victim to interrogate and or blackmail.&nbsp; Laws do not apply when it comes to certain matters of state and to those who govern it. Even the president&nbsp; must adhere to such&nbsp; rules. <br /><br />Who do you think killed JFK? Who had Ronald Reagan Shot in an attempt to assassinate?<br /><br />Gov!

				Maybe it&#039;s only polite to pretend to try and hide your activities. Play the game and all that jazz. Will have a look at bitcoin fog though I find not taking anything seriously and being unafraid to die at any moment to be a fairly solid position to play from.

				No position is solid unless it is one operated from POWER<br /><br />We are all just ducks sticking our heads up hoping it does not get shot off.

				The thing about fear is that it takes brains to know when to be scared&nbsp; and that is something of short supply among many.<br /><br />Being brave,being scared,being paranoid are all just tools&nbsp; to be used. Most just do not know how to fit those pieces into the correct puzzle to make a picture of security around their person.&nbsp; I could be standing in water and I would still leave a part of my brain function to consider it to be false and a delusion. The brain creates false realities at times.&nbsp;

The very fact you had bought Bitcoins could well be all it takes to persuade twelve of your fellow countryfolk that you&#039;re not quite so innocent as it seems.<br /><br />It&#039;s for this reason I offer my cash for Bitcoin service as the very fact you&#039;ve bought Bitcoin can itself prompt an investigation into your private activities - something of a chicken and egg situation.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
