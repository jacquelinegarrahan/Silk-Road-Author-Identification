				If the actual server can be traced to you and you do things that piss off the government I would say the chances of imprisonment are substantial <br /><br />If the server can not be traced to you and you only access it via Tor chances of imprisonment are substantially less

				Get it at a data center. Even if they require payment in non anonymous ways you can use exchangers to anonymously fund them after washing the money securely. Just fill out bullshit information on their registration forms but try to make it seem legit / be legit info largely to get by any automated fraud detection. You might even need to get burner phone or pay somebody to do it, if you need a dedicated server. Dedicated servers are the hardest to get anonymously, they might even want scans of identification docs. Lots of anti fraud systems and such are in place when it comes to dedicated, but I have yet to find a hosting provider who had unpwnable anti fraud / anti crime systems in place it just is a huge pain in the ass.<br /><br />VPS are generally much easier to get. <br /><br />This way even if the hidden service is traced they hit a dead end. Of course always use Tor. If the hosting provider wont let you purchase with a Tor exit you might need to find an open proxy that isn&#039;t on their block list for registration. You probably will need to use an exit node that is in the country you pretend to be in, and you might even need to be able to get a text message or verification phone call to a cell phone registered in that country / produce scans of ID for that country (this is all for dedicated).<br /><br />There are also some bulletproof / anonymous specialty hosts that don&#039;t make you jump through a billion hoops, and most of them are in favorable geographic areas. But expect to pay out the ass for a bullet proof anonymous hosting plan.

				hm heihachi resells for 2X4, they have ties to russian organized crime (probably RBN) and have hosted mucho very illegal shit without taking it down, including everything from botnet CNCs to carder forums to drug forums to child porn to probably everything in between. RBN is tight with the russian intelligence agencies so they can get away with anything. Of course just being on heihachi network essentially means you are doing something illegal so that is something to take into consideration. <br /><br />Of course since you heard about them on an illegal forum you should assume that they are a federal honeypot and totally avoid them. Oh well at least I don&#039;t tell you to use my VPN lol.&nbsp; Actually the only reason I share them is because they are already widely known / infamous bullet proof hosts. Look up heihachi they have hilarious abuse complaint logs. And also because they are selective scammers and you really shouldn&#039;t risk your money with them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br /><br />stephen:<br />i would like to speak to one of you<br />Welcome stephen!

				Can&#039;t I simply just use a fully maximum encrypted server in my own house and then use TOR hidden service? I mean both ways it&#039;s safe... even if the cops take it for investigation it&#039;s still safe.

I know plenty of people who have used their services for botnet CNC and also for hosting illegal forums, but I also know of a few cases where they quite frankly tell people to go fuck themselves after they send money. They are selective scammers. Plus they just resell for 2X4, but pretty sure 2X4 only sell dedicated servers and only speak Russian. <br /><br />There are several hosts that are bulletproof to various extents. Some will host drug forums no problems and ignore absue complaints. It takes hardcore bulletproof to host botnet CNC though even the &quot;bulletproof&quot; providers who don&#039;t care about drug forums will shut down CNC pretty damn fast. Not going to share the others though go dig them up yourself ;P. But there is little need for bulletproof host since Tor pretty much accomplish the same thing. Of course if your hidden service is traced to a non bullet proof provider it may be taken down. But so far this has never happened due to a direct attack on Tor. But I would *not* want to host a hidden service with a server that has any ties to me that are not obfuscated by Tor and long path of E-currency/exchangers or bitcoin mixes etc.

				How does this setup look like to you guys:<br /><br />Internet --&gt; Modem --&gt; SonicWall TZ210 w/ AV... OR UNTANGLE PC --&gt; PC with hardware encryption(TPM) and full software encryption(Truecrypt Hidden Operating System and Decoy) --&gt; Virtualization --&gt; TrueCrypt File Container, using AES-Twofish-Serpent w/ Whirlpool and using the max amount of characters allowed 64 bits, with multiple key files as .jpg files and .mp3 files --&gt; Contents of message board et al.<br /><br />Of course, since Truecrypt is only compatible with Windows for the most part, the PC will also have Bitdefender as AV and Comodo Firewall<br /><br />I WILL TRY TO MAKE THE SERVER in a far away location, but have yet to find a place that will let me. It&#039;s on my list of things to do.<br />
