				Scenario: The police arrive at your front door. They say they&#039;ve intercepted a package which contained illicit substances and it was addressed to you. They also know you&#039;ve purchased bitcoins recently so they suspect you&#039;ve used them to buy drugs.<br /><br />Where are those bitcoins now? What did you purchase them for?

				For starters, you say nothing to the police because everything you say to them can be used against you in court obviously. If they had the goods on you, you would already be arrested they wouldn&#039;t be on a phishing expedition. I would say bitcoin are not illegal and that you refuse to say anything else without a lawyer present. Or say you have done nothing illegal and do not have to answer any questions.<br /><br />If you must, bitcoins you can use to buy anything on the bitcoin wiki under Trade, like web hosting, gambling, domains, unlimited items. Maybe you wanted to buy a lot of best buy or amazon gift certs, maybe you wanted to buy computer hardware, maybe you wanted to do GLBSE.com investments or maybe you&#039;re just a speculator and are trading them on MtGox and other exchanges to make money.<br /><br />Maybe you bought them to change into Pecunix, or Liberty Reserve, or WMZ. Maybe you donated it to a charity. So many reasons.<br />If they want to see transaction history you deleted wallet.dat afterwards for security, or somebody stole them, or you don&#039;t know how to access your online wallet anymore.

				In Canada and most other commonwealth countries like Australia the first thing out of your mouth during any police encounter is &quot;Am I under Arrest?&quot;. If the answer is NO then you don&#039;t have to show ID, or even talk to them further. The only reasons you would have to show ID is if you&#039;re in a bar, a public park (bullshit vagrancy charge), or a theatre or anyplace else that requires you to be a certain age like a casino or driving a car/boat. If you start screaming at them or act like a crackhead they can detain you for breach of peace so be calm.<br /><br />If you are under arrest you say nothing until you get a lawyer period. In Canada and commonwealth they can still question you without a lawyer present but you don&#039;t have to answer, so don&#039;t. Just give them name/address and date of birth that&#039;s all you have to say. Also would be a good idea to ask to see the signed arrest warrant. They can only arrest you under certain cirumstances without one. This is the part they usually fuck up, and you walk. Providing YOU DON&#039;T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.<br /><br />While in detention do not talk to anybody about your alleged crimes because they could be informants. There is also no &quot;one phone call&quot; in commonwealth you can take whatever steps you can to secure legal representation and/or advice.<br /><br />I&#039;m betting the US works the same. Silence is golden, don&#039;t listen to any of their threats or promises because they are all lies to get you to talk and incriminate yourself. Canadians should get the Pivot Legal wallet card called &#039;Know your legal rights&#039;. It&#039;s valid for every province and has 1-800 numbers on it you can call to get legal aid advice or a lawyer, though every single one will just tell you &quot;Don&#039;t say anything&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s also a known fact cops like to arrest and harass people on a Friday, so they have to spend all weekend in the tank waiting to see a judge on Monday. So Friday make it a clean day and hide every drugs you have and evidence. I remember reading something like 60% of arrests happen on a Friday just for harassment reasons alone leaving you in lockup all weekend.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I;ve played the forex market for a couple of years, plus the bitcoin is getting a little more main stream, but i know of a few people that mine, buy/sell bitcoins.. Also, there is a couple poker sites that just use bitcoins, so there are lots of reasons to use it....(not to mention the site like ebay that just uses the bitcoin, cant remember the name, but the bitcoin is starting to gain some momentum in the main stream...<br /><br />Honestly, I think more illegal things are purchased via paypal, wu and moneygram MUCH more than with the bitcoin.. Bitcon just got much more popular when SR got in the news.. Before SR got big, people used the bitcoin for buying downloadable stuff all the time (music, programs, etc), (but the bitcoin was worth less than a dollar, lol)

				Like was mentioned before, speculation. I usually just buy and sell, buy and sell, rinse and repeat on Mt Gox. Sometimes I&#039;ve made as much as 5% a day, but anyway.... That&#039;s a totally legit way to use bitcoins. Then occasionally pay somebody or deposit them somewhere else. Afterall, that&#039;s also what they&#039;re used for, right?
