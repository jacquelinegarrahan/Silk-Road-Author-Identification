				I recently joined, and noticed neither SR nor this forum use SSL encryption.<br />From what I understand about onion routing, this means the exit node we each connect to could read our traffic.<br />Wouldn&#039;t it be very easy for law enforcement to set up their own exit node and monitor traffic? In practice, is there another factor at play?

				You&#039;re right, it would be LUDICROUSLY easy for them to do that, save for one thing: we don&#039;t go through an exit node to get to SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s a hidden Tor service, so it&#039;s in-network only.&nbsp; That means it&#039;s end-to-end encrypted, hence no SSL (HTTPS) necessary.&nbsp; It would just put more of a demand on the server and do very little else.<br /><br />Definitely bear in mind that some exit nodes run SSL stripping software to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and all that lovely black hat junk.&nbsp; If you&#039;re very paranoid, don&#039;t download Tor browser updates via Tor: never know if an exit node is deliberately replacing the real one with a malicious version.

				Hidden services on tor use end to end encryption by design, so there&#039;s no need for SSL.<br /><br />When you download tor updates, make sure you&#039;re on the https:// secured download page prior to clicking the link. You can also get the PGP sig file for any download to verify that the file wasn&#039;t tampered with.

				...and if you had used the search engine, you would have found, as one of the first results, that this question was answered months ago<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14246<br /><br />Not to mention I&#039;ve seen it come up 2 or 3 times in the Security forum already.

				Well yeah, that&#039;s true Astor... but when the damn site closes the connection every other page load and then bitches because it thinks your last search was less than 1 second ago, who can really blame him.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good question &amp; worth bumping/repeating now and then, IMHO.<br /><br />BTW, that&#039;s not good enough Sourman -- SSL for Tor downloads.&nbsp; The problem is that the only guarantee you have you&#039;re talking to the Tor servers and not a black hat running a man-in-the-middle attack is the certificate issued by a certificate authority.&nbsp; Those are pathetically easy to hack/spoof/legitimately buy though.&nbsp; And people tend to do what the men in black who call and say &quot;give us a fucking certificate, we have to take down an int&#039;l drug ring this week,&quot; demand.&nbsp; Would be a damn easy way to identify probably 3/4 of this place; I mean distributing a malicious Tor browser version, that is.<br /><br />(ex: you SSL to the hacker, he spoofs the Tor server certificate, then SSL&#039;s to the server himself and claims to be you -- and passes everything back and forth, after logging/changing it at his computer of course)
