				Would like any information on Bitcoins and how to purchase them, as well as any additional information on the cheapest bitcoin sites. ALSO, if someone could break down a quick step by step on transfering my coins to SR after I purchuse them, I just created a Wallet on Bitcoin wallet. Every site i&#039;ve come across doesnt seem very reliable and there prices are sky high. I appreciate your time and energy! Cant wait untill I can make my first purchase safely.

				Any secrets would be appreciated as well, Ive heard something about poker bitcoin games and such, and websites you can join for free coins. I dont understand how they all collect though, do you have an annonymous Bitcoin bank account? Thanks

				To buy or sell bitcoins for other currencies: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Currency_exchanges contains a huge list of exchange sites. VirWox allows you to buy with paypal or credit card if you need to, but coins take some days to withdraw and you can&#039;t get more than 40$ per day in bitcoins. Mt Gox is the biggest exchange. The prices are more or less the same across all exchanges. If you are a newbie you should try &quot;market&quot; exchanges that automatically match your orders. If you are more advanced you should also try person to person exchanges where you hae to find a user to exchange with, like OTR or bitcoinary (check the list for them).<br /><br />Free bitcoins are hard to come by. Don&#039;t forget that nobody can create Bitcoins out of thin air to give them out for free. Someone always pays to acquire Bitcoins. That said you should check these site for a few, very few mBTC (1/1000 of a BTC): https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#Samples_and_Marketing_Offers<br />To get free bitcoins though you usually have to do something like watching an ad or clicking something. In almost ALL cases the time you spend doing that task multiplied by the minimum wage in India will be more expensive than the Bitcoins you will get for &quot;free&quot;. Try it once if you have some free time to spare but if you need serious coins then buy them or work for them.<br /><br />The &quot;Trade&quot; page I gave you has tons of sites that allow you to sell stuff (physical or digital) or even do small jobs to get some bitcoins.
