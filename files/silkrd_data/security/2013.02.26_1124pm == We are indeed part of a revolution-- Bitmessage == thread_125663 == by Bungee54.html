				Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide &quot;non-content&quot; data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping programs<br /><br /><br />CLEARNET -&gt; https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page

				Bitmessage really fascinates me. My understanding is, it&#039;s sort of a bitcoin analog where the blockchain is the store of all messages. Its anonymity is along the lines of bitcoin too. There is no real &quot;routing&quot; of messages since every user has the whole message chain (or whatever they call it), the username is the public key and the private key is kept in the client like a bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />I was going to start using it with the first beta, but then the security got rather ripped apart by some commentators. Now that I check again I see they fixed most of the identified faults and made the switch to ECC. It looks rather more evolved.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s time?<br /><br />

				So does anybody want to test this out with me? Here are two other threads about Bitmessage:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121341.msg833769#msg833769<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=136428.msg927139#msg927139<br /><br />None of them got anywhere. Everybody&#039;s criticism seems to be, why use this when we have TorChat and IM with OTR?<br /><br />The difference is that both parties must be online to IM. Bitmessage is more like email, except it doesn&#039;t rely on a central or third party server. The client you run is essentially your mail server, but it can get messages even when it is offline for a period of time (after being restarted).<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in this because of the recent TorMail downtime. Bitmessage is a decentralized messaging system. As long as there are *some* nodes on the network, you should be able to get your messages. Contrast that to TorMail. When it is down, all emails bounce.<br /><br />[Edit: Removed setup info, for now]<br /><br />

				Also note that messages are encrypted as part of the protocol, so you don&#039;t have to PGP encrypt. That&#039;s another nice feature.<br /><br />Like bitcoin, the public address is a hash of a private key. Only the person who holds that key can decrypt the message.<br />

				I like the idea of a btc/freenet based messaging system, but encrypting any kind of sensitive messages via PGP is still a must. Even if it&#039;s established that bitmessage keys are generated/stored securely and locally, I&#039;d still PGP anything related to business or personal life.

				Ok, the first thing you should know is that Bitmessage connects to a set of IP addresses which act like Tor&#039;s directory authorities. That&#039;s where it gets info about other nodes. The problem is that there are only 300-400 nodes in the network, and we don&#039;t want our real IP addresses on that short list, especially since we&#039;re talking about using Bitmessage openly on this forum. Bitmessage will connect to these IP addresses immediately the first time you start it, before you can change proxy settings in the GUI, so we need to configure it to run over Tor before the first time we run it.<br /><br />1. Install git and torsocks the normal way for your distro. The packages should be in your repos if you&#039;re using a Debian or Fedora based distro. Otherwise, torsocks source can be downloaded here: https://code.google.com/p/torsocks/<br /><br />2. torsocks is preconfigured to use Socks port 9050 with the Tor daemon. If you want to use TBB&#039;s Tor instead, open /etc/torsocks.conf and change<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; server_port = 9050<br /><br />to 9150.<br /><br />3. Clone the Bitmessage repo with git over Tor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; torsocks git clone https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage.git<br /><br />4. Now we preconfigure it to run over Tor. Create this folder:&nbsp; ~/.PyBitmessage<br /><br />Put this in a file called keys.dat (in that folder)<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[bitmessagesettings]<br />settingsversion = 3<br />port = 8444<br />timeformat = %%a, %%d %%b %%Y&nbsp; %%I:%%M %%p<br />blackwhitelist = black<br />startonlogon = False<br />minimizetotray = False<br />showtraynotifications = True<br />startintray = False<br />socksproxytype = SOCKS5<br />sockshostname = localhost<br />socksport = 9050&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# change this to 9150 for TBB&#039;s Tor<br />socksauthentication = False<br />socksusername = <br />sockspassword = <br />keysencrypted = false<br />messagesencrypted = false<br /></code><br />Yes, I know it&#039;s retarded that the configuration options are in the same file where the bitmessage keys are stored instead of a separate config file.<br /><br />And yes, I know it says messagesencrypted = false at the end. SS and I were looking into it, and that option seems to be unused. It may be there for some future feature.<br /><br />5. Finally, start Bitmessage from the terminal with logging. Go to the folder where you cloned it and run:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; python bitmessagemain.py | tee -a messages.log<br /><br />You will see a red circle in the status bar. It will change to yellow when you establish your first connection (may take 3-5 minutes). It won&#039;t turn green, because we&#039;re running it over Tor and can&#039;t accept connections.<br /><br />Leave Bitmessage running for a few hours, create some keys, send messages, play around with it to see what kind of error messages you get. I&#039;ll make a separate post on the kind of stuff I&#039;m looking for.<br /><br />You can send a message to me at this address:&nbsp; BM-onsou9SN9ufFztCs8Cq6srFogEw5FdXAX<br />
