				It&#039;s been a week so I decided something else may have happened, other than Customs having my sample of Mephedrone and planning a raid on me.&nbsp; ???<br />&nbsp; <br />What do you intelligent comrades think?&nbsp; ;D

				I doubt very much anyone is planning a raid on you. Worse case scenario your package was intercepted at customs. It&#039;s not illegal to receive mail and that&#039;s all they would have on you, yes?

				If you&#039;re located in the U.S., you&#039;re borderline crazy for expecting it to arrive in a week or less.

				Oooh, I see. Well in that case, I&#039;m not sure what the problem could be. An order from the Netherlands took 38 days to arrive one time. I hope you get it all sorted out! Best of luck.

Thanks vendor WERTU for the generous sample! It took way too long but was still way worth it in my mind. <br /><br />Anyone have experience with his mephedrone products or can point me in the right direction (perhaps a thread about Wertus meph already exists)<br /><br />&nbsp;;) ORDER FROM WERTU IF POSSIBLE&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />
