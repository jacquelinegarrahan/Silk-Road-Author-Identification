				Allot of people on SILK ROAD are saying to me that PO Boxes are a no-no, but my IRL friends say that they are good and discrete because it is a federal agency of sorts and cannot be fucked with by other people whereas with rental mail boxes and virtual mail boxes are owned privately don&#039;t have the safety and rights(if you will) of USPS PO boxes.<br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure what to do right now, Security and Anonymity are a top priority for me in this... so I really want to know if I should get rid of the PO and get something else.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				If your mail is shipped via USPS it has every right that any other mail has, regardless of where its shipped to. If you&#039;re going to get a mail box, the post office is the last place I&#039;d get mine. Small mom&amp;pop type places are much better as they typically have less or no security cameras and are more lax about some of the identification requirements.

				I agree with LM. I inquired about a box at a UPS store yesterday and all they need is a picture ID and then some type of bill with your name on it. Both of those can be easily acquired in a fake name, whereas the PO has all kinds of ID requirements. I remember I had to show my freaking car insurance to them! Plus a UPS store (or mom and pop operation) would not have dogs walking randomly through that could alert on a letter or package. Postal inspectors are doing random inspections all the time, from what I understand. That being said, I think that both options are REASONABLY safe, given the fact that we aren&#039;t hearing about a whole lot of people getting pinched while picking up their packages. The one good thing about PO&#039;s, is that often their lobbies are open 24 hours a day, so you could slip in and do a late night pick up, or confuse anyone watching the box by doing a pick up in a crowd of people. There&#039;s something that makes me happy about making pigs sit there all day and night waiting for me. If I am going to take a pinch, at least I&#039;ll be as annoying to the pigs as possible that way!

				You should get better friends. Didn&#039;t I already give you a ton of advice on this very subject already? Yes I did.<br /><br />Let me think. You are buying illegal drugs, and want anonymity, yet you are giving up your identity to a corporation in order to receive them.<br /><br />What is wrong with this picture? I mean seriously?<br /><br />Even if you go to the trouble and expense of supplying fake ID, you have now committed mail fraud, so add that to your sentence for importing/distributing-with-intent-to-supply/possessing drugs.<br /><br />OR<br /><br />You could just buy a virtual office. Hell, buy ten of them. Use a prepaid card, no proof of ID required, nice friendly staff, possible to wear a disguise&nbsp; to avoid CCTV footage without raising suspicion if indeed there is any CCTV, and it&#039;s about 10 times cheaper than any damn P.O Box. <br /><br />Protip, the clerk will also sign for all your packages. And you can call yourself the WhatEver Inc Corporation and nobody will double check it.<br />Protip2: if the people you&#039;re dealing with accept cash in the way I&#039;ve described, then they will also do &#039;extra curricular&#039; services if you pay them, so that&#039;s a good thing.

				I just researched this where I live and the cheapest one I could find was $50 a month. That&#039;s what a PO Box costs for 6 months. Great idea tho. But not financially feasible for occasional deliveries.

				If you&#039;re a vendor and you can&#039;t afford an overhead of $50, then you&#039;ve a problem with your business model as well as with your mailbox.

				A. Dubois, I think I&#039;m finally disagreeing with you..<br />&nbsp;<br />I have a box at the USPS Post Office in my town. It&#039;s a tiny little town built around a college. Plenty of people not affiliated with the college use it though, so it&#039;s not a campus post office.<br /><br />When I registered for mine, I had to show my state ID-- that was it. And a once yearly fee of something like 150 dollars. I&#039;ve been using it for years now, for all of my normal mail, and since i just started using SR, I&#039;ve received 5 packages to the same box. Never had any problems.<br /><br />Also, there are never dogs or LEO anywhere. But then again, this town doesn&#039;t even have a police service as far as I know. Basically, the size of this PO is about the same as any mom and pop shop operation. So if your post office is small, you&#039;re pretty much safe IMO.

				@opio- Wow! Lucky you. I got a PO box last year for 6 months and I had to show 2 pieces of ID and a proof of car insurance ticket. Maybe it is different in my state, which I won&#039;t mention for obvious reasons. You&#039;d think if it&#039;s all federal the regs would be the same all over tho. <br /><br />@pine- Even if he was a vendor, why would he need a place to receive mail? I guess if he got his product for resale from SR he would need one, but I would assume most vendors get their product off the street locally. I do like the way you think, tho. I had never heard of a virtual office. Credit for thinking outside the box.

				imo you shouldn&#039;t use po box or a chain at all. I have gotten boxes at mom and pop places that not only didn&#039;t have CCTV, but didn&#039;t bother to photocopy my fake ID even though legally they are required to. Mom and pop places like this half the time don&#039;t even photocopy your ID, a chain store is almost always going to and a PO sure as hell is going to.

				opiophilia, literally everyone knows everyone in small towns, doesn&#039;t that concern you? I come from a small town originally and I swear to God that those people have fucking G.P.S in their heads when it comes to the town&#039;s social network. It can be inconvenient on a number of levels. An interception virtually guarantees the possibility of being picked up if the police want you. Problem is, if you have used fake ID, that using a P.O box gives the impression of being a trafficker in addition to mail fraud. Think about that.<br /><br />A much better alternative, is to use the student dorm pigeon hole system on the campus. If you can do it, then it makes a controlled delivery next to impossible (search the forums for my thread with &quot;pigeon holes&quot;). Also, it is free...<br /><br />A. Dubois, I also had the impression of him being a middleman between SR and his corner of the woods. Not unreasonable business plan at all, there&#039;s a British teenager in his high school on here making thousands each month doing it, but you need a rock solid addressing system to achieve such a thing with a high volume of mail. You should assume 1 in a 100 packages get intercepted even if the packaging is lead shielded and coated in kryptonite (from some back of the envelope calculations it&#039;s nowhere near that high, but you should still assume it, esp. for weed).

I imagine them using tactics like &#039;name and shame&#039; lists in newspapers, mass scaremongering of buyers etc. They can&#039;t hit the sellers, so the buyers are the low hanging fruit here. In any case, ordering the low quantities you do is a sensible precaution.
