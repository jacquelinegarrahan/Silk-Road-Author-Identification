				Are LEA &quot;Psychologically Torturing&quot; smaller middle SR members with the threat of not to disclose your computer password but give up your SR password.&nbsp; Being Random to through off LEO is a must due to profiling but it is also a random hole which lets LE back in so beaware.<br /><br />It is what they do they will start mining this site breaking members than using their accounts so rep does matter here more than ever..........just saying not all will cave in but you know when LEA sits them down in jail pulls up SR and says log in...........you know some will........the SR password is the weak link in the whole shebang.....so be careful if you are a reseller use multiple accounts for buying and reselling IRL.........

				It seems after second thought I have stumbled upon unawares myself of it.&nbsp; Follow trucrypt........give the police fake SR account.&nbsp; Having it set up however you feel comfortable.&nbsp; It will provide some plausible deniability, but remember at the end of the day drugs are at your mail box don&#039;t play dumb law to defend yourself like LE uses against regular people.<br /><br />But for this to work properly more SR input is needed!

Your post is very unclear. <br /><br />I agree that separate accounts should be used, but what does this have to do with the senate joint task force?<br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t play dumb law to defend yourself&quot; - First off, what does this even mean? <br /><br />Everyone knows that you should simply repeat the word &quot;lawyer&quot; over and over and over and over again, and that&#039;s all. Saying any more than that risks incriminating yourself.<br /><br />More SR input? In what respect? Come on dude, at least make your post intelligible.
