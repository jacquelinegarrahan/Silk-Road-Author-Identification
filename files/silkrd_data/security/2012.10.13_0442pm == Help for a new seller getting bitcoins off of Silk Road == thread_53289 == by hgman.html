				I am looking to find the safest way to get my bitcoins out f my Silk Rad account and back into my pocket as cash, and I would like to get some input. I have an account with Cavirtex, is it safe to transfer it to my bitcoin wallet from SR and then to Cavirtex, or should I be using a different method. <br /><br />Thanks

				This isn&#039;t something I&#039;ve seen openly discussed, so don&#039;t expect too much in the way of answers.<br /><br />Be wary of people offering advice too.

				It will largely depend on the volume of bitcoins. If the amounts aren&#039;t suspiciously big, you can just send them to your preferred bitcoin exchange, sell them, and have the money on your bank account.<br /><br />The bitcoin exchange cannot see that the address the bitcoins came from, is an address from a Silk Road account. However, if the SR server gets compromised, then whoever gets that information can tie you SR account to your cavirtex account.<br /><br />A trick to prevent that is using Bitcoin fog. It is basically a BTC mixing service. It will bounce your btc through various wallets and mix it with other people&#039;s btc, before it returns the coins back to you. If you use that, it is very hard to connect your original SR BTC address to your cavirtex account. <br /><br />You can find bitcoin fog at: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />If the amount of bitcoins are really big, you will need more advanced methods. I&#039;m no expert on that but I may have some ideas. Send me a PM if you are interested.

Your current proposed method would put the security of you, and indeed your customers who have pending orders, in danger should you draw the attention of the authorities.<br />In the interest of safety you should let the community know your vendor name so as we can avoid doing business with you.<br /><br />Shocking.

				First of all, I haven&#039;t done anything with the money I have received. If my buyers are at risk at this point then there is something wrong with the system implemented by Silk Road.&nbsp; Having said that, it doesn&#039;t really matter if I found out now, or if I had found out before. I thought the whole point of this forum was to help people for the benefit of the SR community, I suggest you either have something useful to say, or keep your comments to yourself.

				I believe that Limetless is the man to talk to around here about money laundering. It&#039;s not free advice, though, it&#039;s a paid consultation, IIRC.
