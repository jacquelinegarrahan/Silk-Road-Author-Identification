It&#039;s worth, trust me.<br /><br />That very first feeling when you know for sure that SR is real and you&#039;ve just actually bought some weed online is priceless.

I highly doubt it.

				It&#039;s like Christmas morning only way better. Unless it&#039;s one of those Xmas where you&#039;ve been very naughty. Then the Feds come thru the door instead of the chimney and they don&#039;t bring you a lump of coal, but some bracelets and a government paid vacation to the pen.<br />But so far, Christmas is my favorite holiday.&nbsp; ;)

				I remember my first time.&nbsp; I started using SR about 6 months ago and was nervous on my first purchase.&nbsp; I was actually more nervous about exchanging USD for BTC and did lots of reading about how to do it in an anonymous fashion.&nbsp; Just make sure you use a real address and real name for delivery and you will be fine.&nbsp; People that bitch on here that get caught or get love letters from USPS usually are flagged because they try to use initials, fake names or addresses of vacant homes or businesses.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have never had an issue getting packages delivered to both a PO Box or my real home address....and I have used a number of sellers on SR.&nbsp; If you find a seller that has what you want, delivers as promised and you like their packaging/product, continue to use them.&nbsp; It took me about 5 different sellers before I found my favorite for weed and now I stick with that person.&nbsp; I also order pills occasionally and have my favorite(s) for that as well.&nbsp; You will begin to establish a reputation with the sellers and you might find that you get heavy weight and/or extras.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just finalize as soon as you get your shipment and you will be fine.&nbsp; Always use PGP and you will be good.

				Aaah. I&#039;m gonna pop my cherry next week. I&#039;m so excited. I&#039;ll be nervous of course, but I can just imagine that feeling of seeing the letter/package on my doorstep. Unreal.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be starting with something not as odorous as weed though, so that&#039;ll calm my nerves a bit. But I have a feeling, as soon as I receive the package, I&#039;ll be straight back on SR buying a shitload more, haha.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know any dealers whatsoever at the moment. If I want to get my hands on anything, I have to go through a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend... and that person I barely even see/talk to anymore. And even then, I could only really get weed and maybe MDMA...<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to finally be able to try LSD/shrooms/coke etc. for the first time, even to at least find out whether I like them or not (which... erm... I think we all know what the answer to that will most likely be)<br /><br />SR is an incredible and beautiful thing.
