Luckily SR already prevents outsiders to look at that info, so you are still fine, but encrypting is a must because SR can become corrupted or the vendor account can etc. etc.<br /><br />So learn from this mistake and simply remember to encrypt your info next time. You cannot have too much security on your part.

				1. Relax.<br />2. PGP provides a higher level of encryption over TOR. It further provides securities for vendors/consumers by preventing man in the middle attacks, occurring at TOR exit nodes. This requires a certain level of sophistication to capture, rehash, and then decipher your message(s). PGP adds another degree of encryption for this reason. Furthermore, with exaflop and petaflop computers available to every government (with the right price), TOR is really just a tight string and a few tin cups.<br />3. Order Prep Routine. When I am going to order something, I put in my cart, and visit the respective Vendor Page and study their recommendations. Some vendors have specific rules to follow. Then I use their public key, etc. PGP is by no means an absolute for vendors to process your order, but it makes this whole charade more secure to low-level investigations--investigative journalism, local LE, some FBI cases, etc.<br />4. Relax. Go over your exit strategy for when you are facing disaster. Delete. Deny. Deport. (Deport is optional, of course. It depends of you&#039;re going to go all Aaron Schwartz or not.)<br /><br />Good Luck.

				Ok,<br />&nbsp;thanks all...I was in panic mode lol<br />I&#039;ve worked with vendor before, and he STILL hasn&#039;t read the message(s) I left. <br />Can&#039;t BELIEVE I did that...shouldn&#039;t SR implement some form of check system to assure that buyers/vendor is using some form of encryption?<br />I was an easy slip. <br />Thanks for making me feel better about it, i will take MUCH more care in the future..&quot;learn from your mistakes&quot;...SOLID ADVICE!<br />I&#039;ve always believed the smart man learns from his mistakes, the WISE man learns from everyone ealses...still I was trying to hit the &quot;back&quot; button the second I sent it..total lapse of concentration...wasnt even stoned LOL<br />~PB2k<br />I like this community, lots of nice people here :)

				Unless the SR server is compromised before the vendor marks the order In Transit, you have nothing to worry about. The chances of that happening are extremely small.<br /><br />The way I look at encrypting my address, it&#039;s like wearing a seat belt. The chances of being in a car accident in the next week or month or even year are pretty slim, but wearing a seat belt costs me nothing, and it could be extremely important in the unlikely event that I am in a car accident. So I wear a seat belt every time.<br /><br />Same with PGP. It costs you almost nothing -- ok, about 30 seconds of your time -- but in the unlikely event that the SR server is compromised, they will probably go after the low hanging fruit, the people with plaintext addresses on the server. Might as well encrypt.<br /><br /><br />There are actually more dangerous aspects of this. Some vendors will send you a tracking code by SR message. That code has your address, of course, which completely nullifies encrypting it at the time of making the purchase. Further, the address is deleted from the SR server after the order is marked In Transit, so it is kept for only a day or two, but messages are stored for months after they are deleted. That&#039;s a big liability, especially for big orders that LE would be interested in. If a vendor sends tracking codes, you should instruct them not to do that, or to encrypt the codes with your public key.<br />
