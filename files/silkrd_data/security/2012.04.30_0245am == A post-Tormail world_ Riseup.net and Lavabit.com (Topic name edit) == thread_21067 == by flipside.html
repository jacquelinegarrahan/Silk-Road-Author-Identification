				[We have intentionally edited the title of this thread to reflect the current changes, and to hopefully inspire more conversation/advice]<br /><br />Greetings friends...<br /><br />Since the general, &#039;overall&#039; (hopefully) temporary demise of Tormail, we have been seeking the &quot;next best bet&quot; to continue to offer our customers secure, GPG encrypted email contact.<br /><br />We need a 100% Tor-accessible, IMAP/POP/STMP capable email provider. We would (obviously) &#039;prefer&#039; an &quot;anonymity/privacy-conscious&quot; provider. At this point, we are tossed up between Riseup.net and Lavabit.com.<br /><br />We would prefer Riseup and could &quot;really&quot; use 2 sponsors to get an account ASAP. <br /><br />Any Riseup users out there willing to help us out?<br /><br />From our research, Lavabit.com seems to be a better choice (in general) for the &quot;average&quot; user/buyer as far as the ease of obtaining/setting up a free (and &#039;ad-free&#039;) account with full IMAP/POP/STMP capabilities. They offer 2 free and multiple paid options. Just be sure to register your account using a public computer, public or otherwise anon wi-fi w/MAC spoofing, ect, as Java is required to sign up. After registration, java should not be required if using a mailclient and it &quot;should&quot; be Tor-accessible from there on out. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) <br /><br />Not sure about the most secure server/connection/password settings that should be configured, ect if using Thunderbird, ect. Perhaps someone could chime in? <br /><br />However, although Riseup accounts are harder to obtain, we feel they are an equal (if not better) &#039;overall&#039; choice, &quot;if&quot; you are using Tor/GPG. (REQUIRED with either service though for true security.)<br /><br />Are there perhaps 2 Riseup users out there willing to sponsor us so we can provide secure GPG encrypted email to our customers ASAP?<br /><br />Gift certificates to our shop are &#039;very&#039; possible for interested parties that may be able to help us... ;)<br /><br />Or does anyone perhaps have an even &quot;better&quot; suggestion? If you say Hushmail we will Kismac and delete your entire existence. j/k ;)<br /><br />Thank you my friends!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				Never mind folks. We seem to have gotten our &quot;approval&quot; already! <br /><br />Riseup is very &quot;internet privacy activist-minded&quot;. Give them a good reason why you should have an account and you don&#039;t need 2 sponsors. Something legit you truly believe in. Unjust laws, Internet privacy, Tor/GPG, ect....and it seems you &quot;may&quot; get an account quite quickly. We did! :)<br /><br />Again. Our (current) opinion is that Riseup.net is the best &quot;overall&quot; current provider. 100% Tor-accessible, and even have &#039;java -free&#039; Squirrel Mail webservice like Tormail does!<br /><br />And even provide &quot;virtual keyboards&quot; with their webservice to avoid keyloggers on public computers and otherwise!<br /><br />These guys ROCK! Check out their site! It&#039;s a WEALTH of useful information. These guys KNOW what they are doing.<br /><br />They are our #1 choice. And DONATE! :)<br /><br />(Still ANY advice as to the most secure Tbird settings would still be VERY much appreciated. It&#039;s NOT Tormail. Any thoughts friends and fam?)<br /><br />Lavabit.com is a close second though. And &quot;much&quot; easier to set up an account.<br /><br />Just use Tor and GPG with both. Sign up with Lavabit with caution (explained above).<br /><br />And listen to ALL of Pretty Lights and &quot;Iz &amp; Diz - Mouth&quot; (No assembly Firm Dot Mix) ------- &quot;Bass, treble, mid, high...&quot; ;)<br /><br />That&#039;s REQUIRED! :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				172,<br /><br />There are multiple threads describing the &quot;overall&quot; Tormail situation, but primarily (for now) Tormail addresses cannot send or receive emails from other domains/email providers. They are also not currently accepting new accounts.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				the most recent post on their url says they just can&#039;t use the .net one anymore, so they moved on to .org. You&#039;re right though in that it&#039;s very suspicious. I just checked with the website ( http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/ ) and i can still access the create new accounts page. I don&#039;t know, it still seems like the site is okay.

				It&#039;s not really suspicious. Any domain (.net/.org, ect) is just a shell around their .onion address.<br /><br />Existing Tormail users can still communicate fine with each other (within the Tormail servers) using their new .org addresses. It&#039;s just outside domains/emails that is the problem. And new user registrations.

				souledout,<br /><br />Check the main Riseup site/press release. Absolutely NO customer information was compromised. <br /><br />The server seized was simply one they were hosting for a separate client, &quot;completely&quot; unrelated to their email service.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Server Seizure Update<br /><br />20 Apr 06:18<br /><br />The server that was seized does not have any Riseup data on it. The machine was operated by the European Counter Network (“ECN”), an Italian technology collective. To repeat: no Riseup service or user data is on this machine. No Riseup keys or certificates are on the machine. Furthermore, the root filesystem of this machine is encrypted. <br /><br />Full press release: riseup.net/seizure-2012-april<br /><br /><br />

So it was no more than 4 days to resumption of service.. might have been within 24 hours. The tormail folks are top notch in my book.

				After lengthy conversations with some &quot;very&quot; knowledgeable fellow Roaders and other close, longtime vendor friends over the last week, we feel there are 2-3 &quot;even better&quot; secure, email options to Riseup or Lavabit.<br /><br />We will update shortly after further discussion.<br /><br />In the mean time, &#039;Tormail&#039; (now Tormail.org) is back up and running 100% and is a &#039;very&#039; good option (if not the best currently) for the average user, &quot;if&quot; used with GPG.<br /><br />However. We still &quot;HIGHLY&quot; (pun intended) recommend reading thru Riseup.net&#039;s website! Seriously!<br /><br />It has some the most accurate, useful, GPG/Email/Tor/Net-privacy/Encryption, ect knowledge we have &quot;ever&quot; seen compiled in one place! <br /><br />Quite amazing really!
