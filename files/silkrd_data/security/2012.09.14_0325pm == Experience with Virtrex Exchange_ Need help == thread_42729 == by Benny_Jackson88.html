				hey there, I need some help with purchasing Bitcoins. I remember browsing through here and read that I could get Bitcoins through Virtrex instead of MTGox. Which I did of course and now its sitting in my account. Any posters here who use this than me? I&#039;m just worried about getting traced when I did go through a bank to do a cash deposit.

				I use virtex and I only do cash deposits to credit CAD to my virtex account at banks which I do not normally use and do not hold accounts in. It used to only be RBC but now you can also use Scotiabank and BMO. Sometimes the teller asks for my name when I deposit the money but that is only for their own record in case I give them the wrong account information or something, and there is nothing illegal about buying bitcoins. Sometimes they don&#039;t ask me for any information at all, it takes one minute and I get a receipt and then buy bitcoins a few hours later. Its convenient and I&#039;ve never had problems. I always burn my receipt from the bank after I get the bitcoins, which is probably inconsequential but it makes me feel better. I also have made many different accounts with virtex in the past.

				Quite like CaVirtex also. Never had a problem with them and the once when the bank took forever to deposit $ (it was over a long weekend) their support was helpful.<br /><br />And yes the bank Teller may ask for a name or phone number, just give them whatever name.

				Unfortunately, when I first did this, I went through a bank that I do hold accounts (RBC) and I let them use my bank card and telling them my name! Looks like I messed up alot. If that&#039;s the case, I might have to use a different bank. But one thing though, can I still conduct cash deposits in banks even though I don&#039;t hold any accounts or savings? <br />

				Would it be a good idea for me to create another Virtrex Account or could I still use the one that I&#039;ve already have?

Create a new one for the future. <br /><br />With your current account, transfer your btc to a blockchain.info wallet or other wallet and then mix/tumble your btc before sending to SR.<br /><br />

				When I didn&#039;t have so much mining power I would fund my cavirtex through my everyday chequing account, SR mixes the coins for you. You have nothing to worry about IMO
