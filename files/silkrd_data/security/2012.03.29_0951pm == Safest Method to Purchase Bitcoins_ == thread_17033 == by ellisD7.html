				Hello all,<br /><br />I am new to SR and I am very excited that such a great website exists. But naturally, I am also very paranoid about getting caught. I was wondering what is the safest way to purchase bitcoins without having anything traced back to me? Is using one of these BTC services on SR like BTCKing the best way, or is there a safe way to do it without paying a premium?<br /><br />Thank you very much

				Hey, Well, I can&#039;t guarantee that this is the safest, but i heard that it&#039;s almost the norm, or the easiest way to go about buying bitcoins. I heard from someone that you should open and use your mt.gox account only from a computer outside say from a library. But at my library, you have to show your account when you log into a computer.&nbsp; So they know who you are. You must show a state ID in order to open an account and use your computer, so i&#039;m just doing everything from home and just cross my fingers. <br />So i opened an account on mtgox.com. I then go on bitinstant.com and use their bank deposit service to apply $ into my mtgox.com account. They charge something like %4 which isn&#039;t a lot if you are deposing $100 or so. From mtgox, i&#039;m going to try and transfer my funds into SR. I&#039;m not sure exactly how long it would take but it sounds like it could all happen in say 24hrs or around there.

				bitinstant.com is the best way to do it. you deposit money into a BOA or Chase, and can send that money to mtgox or cryptoxchange or wherever you&#039;d like.

				for a cash bank deposit, do you use an existing account with them like a personal account? or can you set something up that&#039;s more secure?

				nomad is obviously solid.<br /><br />Otherwise, I dont mind paying the premium to save time and avoid using my name on any account or anything, so I usually get coin from BTCKing.&nbsp; All he does is send you the bank account name and number and you take it into your local branch and deposit the cash to the account.&nbsp; No need for a name or anything.&nbsp; He charges 10%, plus a 6 dollar processing fee for every transaction.&nbsp;
