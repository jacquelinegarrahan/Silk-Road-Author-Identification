				Does anyone know of any webmail sites on TOR or the clearweb, that I could access with TOR?&nbsp; BST does not accept TORmail anymore for transactions so I need an alternative.

				Would hushmail be ok if I used TOR and encrypted my emails with PGP?&nbsp; I know that hushmail is how TFM got shut down so I am wary of using it.&nbsp; &nbsp;How about lavabit.com?&nbsp;

				Both lavabit and hushmail are out, they do not allow access from TOR.&nbsp; I would prefer not to use services like gmail, yahoo, hotmail.&nbsp; Can anyone please offer any suggestions?&nbsp;

				I answered this in one of the other Tormail threads. Gmail is a pain in the ass to use over Tor. You would most likely have to buy a burner phone to verify. I don&#039;t know about Hotmail/Outlook.com. However, Yahoo Mail is easy to register and use over Tor. They don&#039;t have good spam catching mechanisms, which is why spammers love to use them, but that&#039;s a feature for people who want an anon email account, too. Only problem with Yahoo Mail is it doesn&#039;t provide SSL support for viewing your email (only for registering/logging in), so the exit node can snoop on what you&#039;re reading.<br /><br />My suggestion is safe-mail.net, which provides SSL for everything on the site, and doesn&#039;t block Tor. You need to disable IP checking in the preferences, or it will log you out when you switch exit nodes after 10 minutes.<br />

				You are the man astor, one of the remaining few around here that are actually helpful.&nbsp; +1&nbsp; &nbsp;This board has went downhill in the past year.... fewer posts and most of the ones that are posted are by the NEW wave of SR users, it seems as if most of the SR Vets have found another place to talk.
