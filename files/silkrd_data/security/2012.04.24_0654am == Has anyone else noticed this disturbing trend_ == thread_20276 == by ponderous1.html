				Hi<br /><br />Im not a newbie. Im a long time user and using this new account as added security measure. <br /><br />Ive noticed recently, within the last 3 months or so, that both aurora and mozilla keep a history of addresses Ive browsed, such as the forums and SR. As in when i type in the first few letters, it auto suggests all the SR and forums site in the address bar.<br /><br />this is even after i shut all windows down, restart my computer and go to visit these brilliant sites. In my 12 months using this, it had only been in the last 3 months that this has started to happen. <br /><br />I have tried to delete the history on the browsers, but they simply are not an option (greyed out on the menu&#039;s)<br /><br />has anyone else noticed this? and should I/ we be concerned?<br /><br /><br />

				maybe it&#039;s just a new feature they added with an update or something? how are you accessing the site? i&#039;d use the liveusb method if i were you, it&#039;s more secure. there&#039;s a tutorial on the front page (the anonymous user guide or whatever) that tells you how to set it up.

				Download a program called CCleaner: www.piriform.com/ccleaner<br /><br />When you&#039;re in the program select all the appropriate options. If you do it correctly that should clear out all the flash cookies/form fills/autosaves/history/browsing data/cookies etc so there is no trace of any of it.

				It should only do that if you have the site saved in your favorites/bookmarks. I have the latest update and it doesn&#039;t do that.

				Are you sure you have disabled the history feature in your browser?<br /><br />Of course, if you are really serious about security you will use either a liveusb (as already suggested) or run a separate virtual OS instance parallel to your regular OS installation. Myself I prefer VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org).

				I thought this was really weird. especially since it occurs on 2 separate browsers! i just reassured myself that im being a paranoid freak.... but now Im not so sure....<br /><br />I do recall it happening shortly after I installed the new Tor browser bundle which auto launches Aurora. Prior to that I always used the old mozilla version.<br /><br />hmmmm....

				I use the TOR bundle, too and I&#039;m in Private browsing mode but when I open a new tab and hit &#039;s&#039; it automatically offers two SR links. Nothing is in my history though and there are no autofill or cookie settings on either.

				Use Linux and quit tripping. If you&#039;re relying on a single program for your anonymity you&#039;re not safe. If you&#039;re serious there are security measures beyond reproach. Think about your holes and manage them. There&#039;s a lot of info out there.
