				Make your Cart, Get exact $$$. Get the quote done(Australia). Get to bank. Go home and send receipt, coins confirmed. Cool no worries, Now open Tor again, go to SR, get a new address for the BTC to be sent too.<br />Open bit-coin client and expect x amount of coins to make your order...........<br />Now this is where I get retarded.. I haven&#039;t used my Bit coin wallet in months and all it doing is synchronizing with the network with 20000 more blocks remaining, it&#039;s been going for 11 hours and I have already lost out on BTC Flux too. But the sad bit is now the listings I planed to get in my cart planed for at least a month in advance are either a different price ever so slightly or none existent.<br /><br />So a warning to any dumb Mother Fuckers out there like me keep your wallet updated or when you plan to use it your fucked. lol <br />-end rant-

				Right there with you!&nbsp; I cannot get bitcoins out of my block chain wallet.&nbsp; &quot;Why&quot;, you ask?&nbsp; At some point I became impatient and posted the bitcoin address on my &quot;watch list&quot; in my wallet.&nbsp; Ughhh.&nbsp; I log-in occasionally just to see them.&nbsp; Without private key, which I didn&#039;t create, I cannot spend or remove from &quot;watch list&quot;.

				There are several options that don&#039;t require you to keep a local store of all the blocks on your computer...<br /><br />One is the blockchain.info wallet (web based, no downloads), another is the Electrum wallet (available from the main bitcoin site) which connects to a remote server that is already synced.

				To avoid this kind of troubles You may use more lightweighted client like Multibit or eve online wallet like Blockchain. I prefer the second one.
