				You don&#039;t want to use Torchat. In addition to being a buggy piece of shit, it also requires that you run as a hidden service which in itself makes you far less anonymous. Torchat is not secure.

				..no problem perhaps my initial post didnt explain; seems to me there isnt any more silc (client or plugin) development thought the last update<br />was around 2008; their documentation is not clear and is a general run-around, so called developers dont get back to you -so i agree seems<br />pointless and a dead-end, was just curious why the decision to use pidgin +silc for the initial silc chat room if jabber protocol (client) is the nuts?!<br /><br />TWM<br />{sorry to highjack this thread..}<br />
