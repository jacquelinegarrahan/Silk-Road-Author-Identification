				To install Tails on a USB stick you need to go buy a blank DVD. Go to the Tials website and download the iso file. Burn the iso file onto the DVD. Install Tails onto the USB stick from the DVD.<br /><br />The actual steps for this are on the Tails website. It really is super easy but unfortunately you do need a blank DVD. I have not gone through an update yet but it may be that you also need a new DVD for each new version. It would be nice if someone could comment on how upgrades are done.

The easiest way is to first burn to DVD, then once u start TAIL, Application &gt; Tails &gt; Tails USB Installer. This will create the USB boot for you. From that point on, you can destroy and discard the DVD and boot from USB. <br /><br />For upgrades, you have a few options. The easiest is having a spare flash drive to download the new TAILs on. Using the same &quot;Tails USB Installer&#039; as mentioned up, you can Clone &amp; Install, Clone &amp; Upgrade or Upgrade from file. <br /><br />USB isn&#039;t as safe as just a DVD. USB drive can be write to where DVD can not. The USB seem much fast than CD. Tradeoff.<br />

				u only need to install from dvd or another tails usb if you want persistence, which i probably dont recommend for this guy since hes just learning, better he cant save or change anything :)<br />there is an iso image that you need to download first.<br />http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.15/tails-i386-0.15.iso&nbsp; &nbsp;(clearnet)<br />also avail via .torrent<br />https://tails.boum.org/torrents/files/tails-i386-0.15.torrent<br />download that plug in your usb, im going to assume your using windows, and instructions, step by step are on the site.<br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/windows/index.en.html<br /><br />its a little easier in linux just a few terminal commands<br /><br />isohybrid path/to/tails.iso --entry 4 --type 0x1c<br />cat path/to/tails.iso &gt; /dev/sdX &amp;&amp; sync&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replace sdX with YOUR path to usb sd. (probably /dev/sdb )<br /><br />

				RTFM, bra<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html<br /><br />Installing Tails on a USB stick<br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html<br /><br /><br />Install Tails onto the USB stick per the instructions above. Reboot your computer and hit whatever button gets you to the boot menu, select the USB stick and boot into Tails. When you get to that point, create an encrypted volume (file) on the same USB stick to store stuff like your PGP directory.<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index.en.html

				so how do you guys save the SR address with tails? especially if it&#039;s on a CD? do you use a trustable site that lists it, then go to that site each time you boot tails?

				I hope this isint tooo stupid of a question. Can you just buy an encrypted flashdrive rather than going through all these steps? or is that not safe and we must do the above listed?

This does not require a CD or DVD burning step, since the UNetBootin software downloads the ISO, and directly extracts it to the USB drive with few modifications.<br /><br />http://unetbootin.net/more-infos-and-get-it/<br /><br />UNetBootin is the easiest way, and it is available on Linux and Windows, and probably MacOSX as well.

				I&#039;m kind of in the same boat ... I cannot for the life of me get Tails running via USB on my Macbook Air.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read all the documentation and the clearnet threads - seems it&#039;s a common problem that some people are able to get around, but others aren&#039;t.&nbsp; Booting from a CD/DVD works just fine, and I&#039;m able to create the USB (it even shows up in the reFIT/reFIND menu at startup) but when I boot it, it gives me an error.<br /><br />This is so frustrating.
