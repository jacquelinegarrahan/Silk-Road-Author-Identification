				I decided to learn how to use GPG and downloaded GPG4win. I had planned to follow the guide by OMVD (something like that), but it turned out that already at the first step I couldn&#039;t check WinPT as he suggested, because it wasn&#039;t there. Instead I followed the compendium that came along with the GPG4win. It took me A LOT of time to manage to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify messages, but I finally learned doing it with help of Kleopatra and Claw Mail, as recommended by the compendium. I came to think of a few obstacles while learning, such as having to decrypt messages if I want to store them, since Claw Mail won&#039;t encrypt the address (or subject, but hopefully nobody would put a revealing subject), and so if someone looked at my computer it would be possible to see that contact had been established between me and the other part, even though what we said wouldn&#039;t be able to be seen. Encrypting stored mails seemed quite tedious to me, so I came here to find solutions, and I realized that if using WinPT instead of Kleopatra, you won&#039;t need a mail client at all, because you can paste encrypted messages using the message system on SR, and WinTP will do the work without being connected to a mail client. This solves the problem of having to encrypt stored messages on the computer, since there will be no such thing. Also, there&#039;s no need for an anonymous e-mail to send the messages from, and less risk to confuse an anonymous certificate for SR, with a non-anonymous certificate for trading bitcoins. WinPT (or equivalent) seems a lot better for SR purposes in other words...so, I&#039;m asking two things:<br /><br />1. From what I&#039;ve written, is there anything you can tell that I&#039;ve misunderstod about GPG (I am trying to understand how it works so please explain my thought errors)? <br />2. How can I simplest learn how to use GPG in SR fashion, be it with WinPT or some other program (or is it perhaps possible with Kleopatra but I&#039;m too stupid to figure it out)? :)<br />

				If you have a USB stick than gpg4usb is awesome and very easy to use. You can download it right to your USB card. <br />Guru told me about it. He also mentioned Kleopatra was not a good program to use. <br /><br />I&#039;m no pro but this works for me.

				Thank you both! I sincerely hope I will learn faster with GPG4USB than I did with GPG4win. Will download and try it out as soon as I find time, probably next weekend. Thanks!
