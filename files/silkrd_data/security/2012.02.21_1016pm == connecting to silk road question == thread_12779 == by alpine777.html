				hi i am just wondering whats the best way to connect to silk road i have heard from many people that using vpns with tor make it less secure. so if i get a powerful WiFi antenna and connect to a public wifi spot along way away is this a good thing or not? i really dont want to have to leave home every time i want to go on silk road but i want to secure the way i connect as much as possible. what are your thoughts on vpns vps ssh. and if you recommend any of these or something else could you please point me in the right direction in how to get it done. thanks

				I don&#039;t see how running tor inside a vpn would be less secure. In fact, I&#039;d suggest it&#039;s more secure. If your IP address is ever detected it would be the vpn address.<br />

				As a buyer, I think your being overly concerned.&nbsp; Just run your system from a USB Flash/Thumb drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use the USB device for booting into the system, use TOR/Silk road, then reboot the system after hiding the thumb drive.&nbsp;

				The general rule is that the more hops on the network, the more attack points. With that said, obviously an open wifi network that you have no connection to is best. (Also out of curiosity, what antenna are you using and what&#039;s the pre-amp?) However if anyone is on that network sniffing packets, they might be able to take over your SR account. If I saw this on a network I was sniffing, I might even go as for to see if your bitcoins are on your system and if they&#039;re plain text, you know, for teh lulz...<br /><br />A VPN ensures end-to-end encryption (ssl is a joke). So setting up a VPN, then connecting to an &quot;open&quot; wifi, then to TOR would be best. But then you have to pay this VPN anonymously as well.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!&quot;

				fyodor, you&#039;re not acutally fyodor are you?!<br />We should talk if you are :)<br /><br />Ok folks, use your creativity a little bit here<br />If you want to utilize VPN...on an open wifi connect to a&nbsp; friend via FREE open source VPN software in another location while HE is connected to an open wifi network. Free temporary VPN! You don&#039;t even have to pay for a service, you just need an endpoint to connect to.<br />Then tunnel your tor session through ssh &gt;= ) Can you tunnel tor through ssh?
