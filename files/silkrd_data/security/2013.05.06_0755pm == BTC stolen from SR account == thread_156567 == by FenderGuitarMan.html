				I made a deposit of coins to my SR account today. BlockChain.info shows that seconds after they reached 13 confirmations they were transferred elsewhere.

How could SR not show the funds ever arriving at all?<br /><br />This just so happens to have been:<br /><br />a) the largest transfer I&#039;ve ever made at once<br />b) urgent in that the seller is going on vacation and I needed to get order in today<br /><br />How could someone have pulled this off without the coins ever appearing in SR?

				Scout, if that&#039;s true, I have a HUGE problem. When I thought my account was hacked, I issued a new BTC address. Will the tumbler know how to deposit the funds to my account? I wrote to support to explain and gave them the old account number and the new. I really hope they can resolve this for me and in less than 12 hours. I was trying to catch a vendor who is leaving on vacation.<br /><br />Appreciate any help I can get. This was a big chunk of money and the timing is very important. I have written to support so I don&#039;t think there is more I can do. But would appreciate insight if you know about the BTC address issue. Does SR &quot;remember&quot; that the old address was mine? Now I&#039;m afraid my attempts to protect myself are only going to slow this down further. Or possible cause me to lose the money.<br /><br />Was there anything posted here that explained the tumbler and the delays today? I scanned titles to see if anything would explain what I was experiencing but didn&#039;t see it. I kept getting logged out of SR so I became convinced that those login screens with improper Captchas were phishing attempts so I changed my BTC address, password and pin! At the time this all seemed logical.

				Your old address is still associated with your account, so you should still see the bitcoins.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t happen automatically, then you&#039;ll need SR Support to push it through manually.<br /><br />No, there hasn&#039;t been an explanation, but this has been a common issue periodically throughout the last few months - delays both in and out of SR.&nbsp; Everyone always receives their coins, even when it takes longer than it should, and even when SR Support has to push the transactions through manually.<br /><br />Remember, this is not a simple wallet to wallet transfer here - there is also coin tumbling involved, which makes that system more complex and introduces possible delays when it&#039;s not functioning correctly.<br /><br />The situation will resolve itself - or at least it usually does.&nbsp; If not, still no need to worry because DPR is aware of the delays and will get things fixed.
