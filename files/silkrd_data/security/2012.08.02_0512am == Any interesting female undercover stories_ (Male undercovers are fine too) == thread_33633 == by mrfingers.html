				I hear a lot of stories about undercovers at raves and music festivals, like this one that dressed up as a mummy at a rave on Halloween giving free body massages, and then later was assisting another officer with an arrest, still in his mummy costume.<br /><br />Another undercover actually went as far as to make out with this girl who was friends with some Oxy dealer, went up to her dealer in the club and told him he was cool. They did the deal, 5 minutes later a team of uniformed cops go straight up to the dealer and arrest him, was paid in marked bills.<br /><br />However I&#039;ve never heard of a female undercover, and they sound like they would be dangerously manipulative beings. Especially with us ya know, only able to think with just one of our brains at a time. Could only imagine how easily they could bust you when you&#039;re steering the love train on some molly or shitfaced.

				Someone asked me at a concert if I had seen there friend molly, <br />and I said &quot;I wouldnt come to one of these things fucked up and selling&quot;<br />and he looked at me and said &quot;So your fucked up?&quot;<br />and I was all like &quot;Hell no&quot;<br />and he laughed and walked away<br /><br />He was pretty clever and almost mind fucked me into incriminating myself by admiting I was fucked up.<br /><br /><br />And then 5 minutes later hes on a walkie talkie next to 2 people being arrested for smoking weed.<br /><br />This is clever, because its not really entrapment. They are asking if I had seen a person, not if I had drugs. I would be incriminating myself if I had said I had drugs ofcourse.<br />

On molly I respond really fast to questions and I don&#039;t have any natural defenses built up. Since then I&#039;ve made the conscious effort to train myself to simply never admit anything about drugs, possession, experience or intoxication, just kinda ignore the subject and talk about something else (if its an undercover they&#039;ll fuck off pretty quickly, if not they&#039;ll carry on the conversation with you otherwise, regardless I still never get back into the topic of drugs). <br /><br />I remember when I was still new to molly I was at this rave and was most likely tricked by an undercover without them even trying, they probably just didn&#039;t want to waste blowing their cover on a drug user and save it for a dealer. Walking up these stairs rolling face, excited by all the dubstep and crazy shit going around, two casually dressed dudes in their late 20s or early 30s just straight up asked me &quot;If I knew where Molly is?&quot; as were passing each other by. My immediate response was blurting out with a huge smile &quot;No, sorry I already ate it before I got here!&quot; Their response was to laugh and repeat what I said &quot;He already ate it&quot; as if that&#039;s such an uncommon and hilarious thing. We both quickly moved on and I realized immediately after I said it what I may have done. Just got lucky I guess.

Even touching your arm, whispering in your ear, flirting or implying sex constitutes as sexual.<br /><br />How was she dressed? Really slutty like a lot of the rave girls? Or just normal clothes?

				Ya you are lucky! An element that helped you is you already suggested you did not get in inside the concert, so detaining you would not lead to an arrest that night but would require a full on investigation. They&#039;ve got easier fish to fry. I&#039;ve realized that most people already have their drugs before a concert. and if its 4 hours into a concert and a sober person comes up and asks for drugs, 99% of the time they are COPS!!!<br />How could any respectable drug user not have there drugs by then?
