				My bank information is already linked. If I bought bitcoins from coinbase and sent them to my blackchain.info wallet then to silkroad bitcoin address is this completely anonymous? And how long do you think it&#039;ll take to receive bitcoins from coinbase.com when you buy them? If anyone else uses coinbase please let me know. Thanks

It wll take an hour to move them into another wallet. I use a more indirect method (than one intermediary wallet), you can do a search for &#039;coinbase&#039; here on the forums and find many threads discussing it.

To anonymize your coins, use bitcoinfog: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion

All I buy from SR is personal usage, so I don&#039;t have to worry about moving that kind of money.
