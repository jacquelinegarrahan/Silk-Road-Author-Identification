				Because i have&nbsp; read about Anonymizing bitcoins sending it through mines and laundering, which seems like a long process?<br /><br />Can i keep putting money in my Silk Road wallet &quot;safely&quot; from a third party bitcoin provider? without anyone tracing me

				It could be safe, I dunno because I send them through other things first. At least send them to something like InstaWallet first.

				Nah, it&#039;s run by the DEA.<br /><br />All kidding aside, it&#039;s just a personal Bitcoin wallet that allows you to anonymously hold your coins. Send them there, and then send them to your SR address. Or you can further tumble them if you feel it necessary. But it always helps to add an extra layer of obscurity to the Bitcoin trail!

				Instawallet is great, just dont lose the URLs they give you.<br /><br />In all due honesty you probably dont need to worry about direct deposit.&nbsp; Any furthur transactions you make are sent through the SR tumbler.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re paranoid like most of us (me included) follow the above suggestions.
