				Title says most of it. I am wanting to take off ANY SR related things, Tor, PL&#039;s Coupons, anything. All while keeping my other original files. I would then like some advice on how to encrypt a USB properly with TrueCrypt. +REP to whoever answers.<br /><br />Will this complete the hardware end of anonymity for me? I obviously am not new to SR just wanting to make sure my hardware is in check!

				well i have no problem with this but you might be able to do this, in the beginning i crypted everything on truecrypt and then i formated my computer so i felt secure now, i have a different laptop set up, with no HDD and i juse a portable encrypted hardrive to run an os, might be a bit more money put sure to keep you safe

				What operating system are you on? Are you using a HDD or a SSD? have you ever had sensitive things unencrypted on your drives?<br /><br />If you are on windows you could just do FDE with Truecrypt, it overwrites what is on your drive with an encrypted version of it, possibly/probably not as safe as doing Secure Erase of the entire drive and encrypting it first thing, but it is most likely fine. If you have a SSD and it has ever had sensitive information on it in a non-encrypted format, you are fucked because of wear leveling. SSD need to be encrypted first thing or else they are insecure as soon as they have anything sensitive on them that is not encrypted. Same goes for your USB drive as well, if it is fresh or never has had anything sensitive on it you should just encrypt it with Truecrypt, otherwise you should probably toss it honestly. If you are on Linux it is much easier to encrypt at install time than later on, but you can still configure FDE from in an already installed OS. I have never done it except at install time , but I can probably find a tutorial and walk you through it if it is a requirement of yours.

				tails is a usb bootable form of TOR and i personally dont use liberte but i asume its the same?<br />and nothing is trully necessary but you cant ever be to sure, and all you need to reinstall your OS is a cd corresponding with the OS u want, weather it be vista ,7,8 or xp and a product key for it, which i guessign you already have seeing how u have windows, if you dont have the installation disk, contact your computers manufacture and ask for it, it cost around 30-40

				TAILS and Liberte are two linux distros geared towards anonymity and security. They&#039;re very similar. I prefer Liberte for disk installs and TAILS for LiveCD/USB use.<br /><br />Basically they are:<br />Non-persistent. Every time you reboot the system it&#039;s back to scratch. Nothing is saved on the disk where LE could forensically recover.<br />That said, they both offer the OPTION to create a persistent area on the USB or HD. The OS is still running from RAM and starting from scratch each reboot, but the persistent encrypted store allows things like GPG keys, apt-get packages, etc.<br /><br />ALL network traffic is directed over Tor. Nothing goes over the clear net.<br /><br />Includes most security software, GPG etc.<br /><br />Highly patched and security audited.<br /><br />I have an SR oriented laptop listing:<br />Custom Security-Hardened Dual-Boot Thinkpad E535<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1b52d9a7e4<br /><br />Not trying to push my wares on you, but if you read the item description you may get some ideas for securing your own system.

				If you were to have a completely different computer for using TOR and SR to buy and sell drugs, would it matter than you lurked around on SR on another main computer? I mean you&#039;ve done nothing illegal by browsing the sites and no information on the site links the computer to misbehaving or selling drugs, would it matter if that information was on the computer? Even when the new computer is fully encrypted and pretty undetectable?

Even using something like Eraser. As far as I remember, it had something to do with the &quot;cluster tips&quot; on SSD drives not being able to be fully overwrittin and/or encrypted, meaning you cna never know that ALL the data on the drive was wiped, even though it says the drive has been/is 100% empty after the wipe.<br /><br />@username10: As with my previous statement, im not 100%, but again, while researching said threads I mentioned above, people were saying that its not just a software thing. Thats their first stage to see if they can easily and quikly get the ifno back. But if they cant find anything through that and they are looking for a big enough charge against you, the hard drives are dissasembled, components are removed and plugged into other types of PC board/electronic componenets that allow the forensic teams to then start going into the actual physical electronic components on the drive to search for left over data.<br /><br />Mate, like I said before, the only way that its possibel for a previous SR user thats been just using their everyday pc and mounting truecrypt USB&#039;s etc, to be 100% at piece of mind, is to DESTROY the drives and dispose of them as per my instructions on the previous page. Theres a reason high end server/networking based companies use this exact method for getting rid of hard drives. And they just do that because of sensitive client and company info, which is purely legal.....If they go through those steps jsut to make sure something as simple as identity theft cannot happen as a result of hard drives being obtained through the trash or through recycling depots, Im sure you can see why taking these same steps with something like SR activity is not really too much of a stretch.<br /><br />The best part of doing this, and moving to a live dvd system, is that form that day that those drives are destroyed and disposed of. If your house was raided, you could sit in an interrigation room KNOWING with 10000% certainty they got jack shit except posession. IMHO, a weekend of working on your computer and spending about the same amount of money as would get you an oz of weed. Is well fucking worth it...<br /><br />S

Install new win7, get all updates, don&#039;t install warez, install truecrypt and set up full disk encryption: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttbtGTlOTA<br /><br />5. set up windows firewall to block all connections that are not on the list of allowed programs: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-Windows-Firewall-settings <br /><br />6. for normal browsing the web only use firefox with no-script, better privacy addons, use duckduckgo instead of google. don&#039;t install flash, silverlight, java<br /><br />7. install microsoft security essentials and click under settings -&gt;MAPS -&gt; i don&#039;t want to join MAPS<br /><br />8. If you use a notebook, you can set a boot and hdd password in BIOS! Also disable firewire and esata in BIOS!<br />And never use standby mode!&nbsp; ( http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-firewire-dma-part-1-overview-and-mitigation )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you have a similar &quot;guide&quot; for mac or linux? <br />Might be good to make one post about it - with the &quot;guide&quot; for each type of OS (some mod might even wanna &quot;stick&quot; it).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Well, those were just a few thoughts, if he really wants to use Windows 7 and how he can wipe his PC&#039;s. <br />&quot;clean Windows 7 + Truecrypt&quot; may be safe enough against LE in some european countrys and for a &quot;personal consume buyer&quot;.<br />But if I would live in the USA or Iran i would definitely (even for personal consume buys) use a cheap second hand notebook (maybe a Dell D430) in combination with Tails for SR only.<br /><br /><br />Little guide: <br /><br />1. Buy a cheap little notebook like a Dell D430, pay cash<br />2. Buy a 4-8GB usb-stick (maybe read some tests and buy a fast one (read/write speeds), not the cheapest)<br />3. Download: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/<br />4. Download newest Tails version (check checksum of the iso (tails site explain it), check regulary for new versions and do 5.+6. again)<br />5. Use the installer above to create a Tails usb stick<br />6. boot your cheap little and cute notebook from the tails usb stick and maybe create a encrypted persistant storage on the intern harddrive. (also set up boot and harddiskdrive passwords in bios)<br /><br />Tin foil mode: Buy (also with cash) a UMTS stick or card and use prepaid cards for internet connections only. <br />And if you do so, don&#039;t browse from your home. (maybe drive with a bus through your city)<br /><br />Again: That&#039;s just a basic concept and you should research more on your own.<br /><br /><br />For OS-X Lion or Mountain Lion: Activate Filevault 2 and dont&#039;t share the key with Apple! (they will ask in the wizard)<br />Optionally buy http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index-en.html and deny every suspicious connection. (much things/processes you have to research)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Thanks a lot for that, going to look into the things oyu mentioned. However, for us that are buying personal use amounts, and not ordering 10 orders a week kinda thing, I doubt that a suspected SR user is going to be subject to that kind of forensic probing. If you read my post above on how proffesional server companies destroy of their drives, if a SR USER that wants to wipe the slate clean follows that, theyre guarunteed to be fine. If your a high up vendor on here and they finally trac you down and raid you, then I could see that kinda tech and budget being put into the investigation. Crazy info though.....Amazing how well hard drives retain data, relative to how new this world of computers is (not to harp on relativity but computers and electronics are really fucking new in the grand scheme of recorded history).<br /><br />You guys seen the new tehcnology that allows something in the realm of millions or 10&#039;s of millions of times the data in the same surface area as a standard CD/DVD......Theyre creating synthetic DNA, and using it to store digital information that a computer can then read from. Theyve successfully stored a speach by martin luther king, a photo of the Lab they first made te discovery in, some classic book and I think some music. Freaking insane.....

				@Sulsta @kmfkewm @tempo @eddiethegun<br /><br />Thanks fella&#039;s all very awesome responses. So I would like some more situation specific advice if that&#039;s cool...<br />&nbsp;I have a old laptop that I can use as my SR only computer and encrypt it after all of this...<br /><br />&nbsp;I have accessed SR on 4 different computers, all PC&#039;s.... I know I know this is shitty but my internet hasn&#039;t been reliable place to place. All of these are owned by loved ones unfortunately. Making purchases and storing files (besides Tor, txt, ect) from only 2/4..... Ill go down the list<br /><br />-My soon to be SR only Laptop (Browsing/Posting only so far)<br />-My Home Laptop (Purchased from)<br />-My other home&#039;s Computer (Purchased From)<br />-Another relatives computer (only downloaded tor and browsed/posted)<br /><br />My (other home computer and STB SR laptop have the same actual IP)<br /><br /><br /><br />My Q&#039;s <br /><br />1. If I only browsed on them will deleting Tor and a system wipe be efficient since I didn&#039;t actually do anything from my relatives PC but download and browse. (relatives PC)<br /><br />2. (My other Homes Computer) this is absolutely essential for me to get clean! I have downloaded Tor, made orders, posted, and downloaded some coupons to this PC so a clean slate is needed. Do I absolutely have to trash it? Its got around 600gigs of memory. Thats not cheap to replace but I will spend the $ if I must.<br /><br />3.(My home laptop) this one is also crucial for me to get clean, however this is a cheap ass laptop that I would not have a problem trashing after I got my needed files of course. So I would basically take out the HD after I have backed up all my crucial photos ect an and then trash it? I can keep the laptop and it&#039;s clean?<br /><br />So if I can get these three answered I am ready to start my cleanup and then proceed with encryption. The biggest problem is (my other homes computer) as it should not have any trace whatsoever since it will be kept and used for a legitimate business.<br /><br />Thanks all<br />-W0

In fact, thats even overkill, lol. If you are going to get a knock on the door by the popo with a searh warrant, its going to be at the address that you are registered as living at or they have surveiled you living at (again, unless ur some big time dealer ur not gonna be under surveilance dont start getting paro). Basically, the addresses you live at, and in particular the address you live at which has an internet account i your name, is are where u wana clean up. The cops are never ever going to obtain search warrants for multiple houses on the off chance theres evidence you are a personal drug user.....theyd only do this for drug syndicates running operations out of multiple locations. Again, put things in perspective.<br /><br />2: With this PC you should do at LEAST a tripple pass encryption/format of all drives used in the system if you want peace of mind, ERASER iwll do this but GOOGLE how to use it properly. Tis would be sufficient for most. I however recently went througha&nbsp; similar period of wanting to wipe the slate clean and start using live boot dvd&#039;s only, so PURELY for 10000000000000% Piece of mind, I got rid of all the hard drives used in my system, destroyed the discs in them as stated and disposed of them. This was not because Im a big orderer, vendor or think im being watched. It was purely because after finding that windows had logged some incriminating info somehow off my mounted truecrypt volume, I jsut went balls to the wall so that now I know theres not a snowballs chance in hell of any evidence off my pc in court if that should ever happen. How far you want to go is up to you. Some people sleep easier on things than others.<br /><br />3: Again, same answer as above, and id assume the laptop is clean if u dispose of the HD. Although Im a PC person, never owned a laptop, no idea of how they operate so I cant give you a 100% answer.<br /><br />S

				Well, the beauty of it is none of the IP&#039;s are under the name I ship to :D Even until recently I didn&#039;t even ship to my own home. I have recently only for small scale things 1/8th&#039;s shrooms ect... Since I lost my other shipping address.<br /><br />As far as #2 I just did a 30x pass with eraser on anything tor or SR related... I only erased the files I didn&#039;t format the HDD or encrypt it. I don&#039;t do that with eraser do I? I just selected the individual file folders. I know for a fact there was not one thing SR related stored anywhere but my desktop and recycle bin. I plan on trashing the HD when I get a new external.....<br /><br />Ok so now I am to the point where I have a brand new USB 16gigs. I want to make it EXACTLY like the darknet booters on SR!<br />

				There isn&#039;t much reason to destroy your HDD and dump it at some random location, unless you want absolute peace of mind. If you are okay with 99.999999999% peace of mind, and it is a HDD and not SSD, you can just wipe it with ATA Secure Erase. SSD and USB drives and you may need to trash them though, depending on what has been on them.
