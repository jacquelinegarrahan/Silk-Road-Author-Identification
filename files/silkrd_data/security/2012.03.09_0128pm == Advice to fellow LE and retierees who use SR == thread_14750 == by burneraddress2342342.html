				(I know this will make a flame war. Can&#039;t stop it. Just don&#039;t feed the trolls and we will be fine)<br /><br />I have seen a couple people identify themselves as ex or current LE on these boards lately, offering tips to everyone else. Kudos. We all know that joining L.E.A.P. while you are still on the job is career suicide in most places, but they are a great place to go when you retire. Google them. If you have a great union or huge balls, join L.E.A.P. while you still have a badge. Anyway -&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s been common knowledge for many years now that the only groups of peace officers who are truly in favor of our current drug policies are rookies (who don&#039;t know any better) and chiefs (who have been ou t of touch for many years). Nice that here we can &quot;come out of the closet&quot; and all, but try to remember the ONE THING YOU DO MORE THAN ANY OTHER PROFESSION! Aside from talking to people and waiting for stuff to happen, what do you do? What takes up about 3 hours of every 8-10 hour shift?<br /><br />Reports. Logged, reviewed and mostly unedited reports. Your text, your style, your syntax and your grammar. <br /><br />Newspaper reporters run their writing through multiple editors who each changes a few words, the pacing of narrative, the past/present tense and so forth. It becomes generic by the time it is in print. Cops, on the other hand, write hundreds of reports a year, and aside from having your sergeant or buddy check over your spelling and punctuation, they are unedited. And then most systems put all of them as raw data into a multiagency computer which we have all used for information sharing. <br /><br />My point is, your writing style is as unique as your fingerprints, and you put thousands of samples into NCIC and other databases over the years, and there have been no editors and copywriters to remove your personal touches. You are highly identifiable, and some dipshit in khaki pants and a polo shirt (for you civilians, that how feds dress when slumming with local cops) will get ambitious enough to find you if you are too helpful here. <br /><br />Before posting stuff on SR, run it through a rewriter online. For now, just run it through babelfish and translate it from one language to the other a few times before going back to English. Get some non-cop friend to completely rewrite it. Have someone transcribe it as you read it rapidly so they make errors and substitutions. Somehow make the writing not your own style. It&#039;s not perfect and a good computer can probably reverse-run that sort of stuff to get the original text, but it is better than nothing. People here on SR can probably suggest better ways (and will likely put them in the comments as time goes on). But for now, just scramble your words as much as you can.<br /><br />Especially you older folk. Forensics are getting better, so watch yourself. <br /><br />---------<br /><br />This account is a burner account, created for this post alone. it will never be logged in again and the author will not receive nor reply to any questions. All other people with any ties to the legal system are encouraged to burn forum accounts after a single use. Feel free to copy this disclaimer for your own use. <br /><br />For everyone else - take small comfort in knowing that you have friends in blue/khaki/etc uniforms who will post advice here from time to time, and and as long as you DO NOT FUCKING DRIVE WHILE HIGH or something like that, things really will be ok.

				yes it could be used to identify me, but i guess only if i was high up on the most wanted list or something. <br /><br /><br />I guess the moral of this story is the bigger you are, the less you should say

				There&#039;s another thread about this.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12704.0<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s called writeprint, and it can indeed be very effective given a large body of sample material. I think it&#039;s pretty easy to maneuver around though, you just have to switch around words and tenses from what you normally write.<br /><br />A thanks to OP, if he/she is indeed LE.<br />&nbsp;
