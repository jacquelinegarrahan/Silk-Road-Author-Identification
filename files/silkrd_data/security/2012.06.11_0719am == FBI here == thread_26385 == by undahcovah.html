				Hey, FBI investigator here.<br />I&#039;m assigned to this case, but personally, I have no problems with it as long as no one gets hurt.<br />Anyways, a report is due in a few days and I&#039;d like some bogus information so no one above has any idea what to do.<br /><br />What are some things I can slip into the report to make it tougher to bring you down?

				Yes, I&#039;m with that guy.<br /><br />Buy some liquid 25i-nbome (its very cheap!)<br /><br />And throw that into the work coffee supply.<br /><br />It&#039;s a relatively weak psychedelic so noone will go insane or anything absurd, but people will have trippy as fuck visuals and it will change the way they see the world (at least for a short while)<br /><br />Actually, that&#039;s from the perspective of someone into drugs.. What would probably happen is they would have a panic attack, shit themselves, and go into therapy or into some kind of episode, thinking they had gone insane. That&#039;s probably the actual reality of it

				If you truly are an FBI agent ( 8)) I would suggest reporting on the prescription drugs &quot;available&quot; on this site.&nbsp; Seeing as the majority of the illegal narcotics are very very under developed in terms of sales representation, the average citizen would not consider this site to be of epidemic proportions; for my opinion.<br /><br />There are a lot of prescriptions on this site, and I do think big pharmaceutical companies would be at the very least interested to know where their drugs are going.&nbsp; I&#039;m not suggesting covering up the narcotics such as the weed and amphetamines, but maybe adapt a different approach to them.&nbsp; If you outlaw the site, it will all go back on the street.&nbsp; This way, 21 year old college students don&#039;t have to drive to their local ghetto at 3 in the morning to buy drugs.&nbsp; It is ultimately safer,&nbsp; but still something that needs to be dealt with.<br /><br />The users on this site, however productive or real they may be, know they need to use it anonymously.&nbsp; They should take pride in knowing that as it helps keep their habits safe.&nbsp; Prejudice is very prevalent in drug use, and can lead to a lot of mixed results.&nbsp; Drugs will never be done away with, but eating a chicken risotto every night and waking up to an &#039;ill mannered&#039; citizen headache isn&#039;t going to help anything.&nbsp; The drug community is it&#039;s own community and needs to accept that.&nbsp; There should with a doubt be an agreement when logging into this site to prevent anyone from spreading unneeded information on users.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t have the best history with any matter, but I know what it&#039;s like to be paranoid and still want the best to happen.&nbsp; That&#039;s all I have to say. <br /><br />There are some very scary and harrowing opportunities available here, and I&#039;m more than happy to help work them out as I simply want the best.&nbsp; What goes around comes around I suppose. :o

				I&#039;m gunna get all hypothetical and pretend that this isn&#039;t a joke. Just to make it clear if you were real, surely you wouldn&#039;t have posted this publicly because let&#039;s face it....it&#039;s kind of obvious that there&#039;s going to be more than one solitary-fuck of an FBI agent investigating SR. It&#039;s pretty obvious that the DEA, Customs, ATF, and whatever you Americanos have as your version of the Fraud Squad would be interested in this place as well as the FBI. On top of that you will have SOCA, the Fraud Squad, HMRC watching as well so anyone who did a report that showed this place in a not-so-negative-light would clearly be singled out. In fact, here is how the conversation after reading it would go -<br /><br />FBI wanker boss - Hmmm.....everyone apart from Agent Jenkins has stated that Silk Road is a clear and present danger to the lives of young Americans blah blah fucking blah<br /><br />FBI wanker boss&#039;s minion - Oh....that&#039;s odd....there was someone who said they were an FBI agent that said they were going to go easy on Silk Road....<br /><br />FBI wanker boss - Also....the report contains the same things that were suggested to that FBI agent who made that post....<br /><br />FBI wanker boss&#039;s minion - What shall we do sir?<br /><br />FBI wanker boss - Well for starters you better take Agent Jenkins off my Departmental Christmas Card list.....you better cancel his bonus too.....<br /><br />(or something to that effect)<br /><br />If you are an ACTUAL Fucked-up Beyond Imagination agent (see what I did there....pretty witty in my opinion ;)) can you say that DPR is actually George Bush, he didn&#039;t do your country any favours and if you could just say DPR is actually George Bush it would do your country a lot of favours along with doing us a lot of favours. For all those thinking &quot;But wait Lim...what about any future Bush anecdotes we may miss out on&quot;, the guys out of office now. There ain&#039;t gunna be any Bush-isms of any value UNLESS we get him in the doc for drug-charges. <br /><br />Everyone&#039;s a winner!
