				I noticed this the other day. Sorry, I didn&#039;t save the link. I saw it, clicked it. Realized wtf I just did, and turned off my PC and wiped every drive in the house. Reformatted; reloaded OS; reformatted; Trucrypt (7 pass); reformatted; reloaded OS.<br /><br />WTF....<br /><br />WHY IS THERE AN ONION.TO LINK ON VENDOR PAGES?<br /><br />It was a coke vendor... This isn&#039;t to &quot;out&quot; the vendor (can&#039;t remember who), but to warn SR Users.

				The .to extension means that a proxy was used to allow regular browsers to see the onion site&#039;s content, but if you followed the link with your tor browser, your connection was still routed through tor before it went through the .to proxy. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it if I were you, to the best of my knowledge, you&#039;re safe.

				Not a huge problem like it said above but you should probably change your passwords incase onion.to saved them. You could maybe get a new bitcoin address associated with your account too.<br /><br />If you didn&#039;t actually login you don&#039;t need to do any of that.

				Question,why would it be ok to access the SR marketplace through a private proxy?&nbsp; I know you CAN, but then doesn&#039;t your unencrypted info get sent through someone else&#039;s server?&nbsp; Especially if they&#039;re putting that link on the forum where most(hopefully all) won&#039;t simply be viewing the page through a normal browser anyways?<br /><br />I&#039;d change my password.

				I would avoid any vendor with onion.to links on their page like the plague! I mean if they can&#039;t take THE most basic security precaution of actually using the Tor Browser Bundle, imagine how insecure your personal information would be!?<br /><br />I have visions of vendors like that writing down the address on a scrap of paper to transfer onto a post-it that they use as a shipping label. With &quot;DRUGS INSIDE - PLEASE DON&#039;T OPEN&quot; scrawled on the outside in crayon. Definitely not good.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Libertas
