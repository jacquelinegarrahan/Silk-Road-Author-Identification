				Yar, if you haven’t heard it before, you have now. If you have, congratulations I’m still posting this.<br /><br />A recent (last couple of months) sophisticated malware scam loads a fake FBI screen and locks down your computer until removed or a ransom amount paid via MoneyPak. It may be able to continue working in the background even if the screen is frozen, has virtual control over the computer until removed, can morph to resist removal and grinds computer to a standstill. It has been suggested it may even have the ability to remotely activate capture cams.<br /><br />There are 3 main pop up screens, each demanding a &quot;processing fee&quot; of $100 or $200, depending on version. The screen quotes several bogus and ridiculous sounding laws encompassing commonplace browsing habits like downloading copyrighted music or video, as well as bestiality and child pornography, and leaving a computer unattended. According to www.2-spyware.com, the virus can &quot;be downloaded together with other programs or files without any permission asked. This may be fake video codecs, Flash updates or other freeware from the source that is not official.&quot;<br /><br />Official MoneyPak site recognizes this under *clearnet* http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/august/new-internet-scam, *clearnet* http://botcrawl.com/how-to-remove-the-fbi-moneypak-ransomware-virus-fake-fbi-malware-removal/ gives screenshots, and *clearnet* http://malwaretips.com/blogs/fbi-online-agent-virus/ provides step by step instructions to remove it. Alternatively, a video guide for removal can be found at www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dKBXeoLIFo.<br /><br />If you see any of these malware screens on your computer, immediately shut it down and reboot in safe mode with networking, following instructions above. Be advised that the malware can sometimes circumvent even this procedure by bypassing it. It is advised owners of infected hardware refrain from authorizing funds via MoneyPak as the malware itself will not actually be removed, and to make a report to police in your area. If police uncooperative, consider asking for which specific department is responsible for cybercrime (usually a federal taskforce), or perhaps threaten to confiscate their doughnuts or child porn.<br /><br />Piece out. <br /><br />--------------Feel free to add to this--------------
