				So first off I downloaded agp and am having no luck with it. Whenever I try to save my keys I get some strange unknown object in stream error. It is really frustrating me. I know agp isnt the most proven encryption but its atleast something. Any other reccomended programs? Also whats the general conscientious on the built in device encryption option for android phones? Any better options available?

				Did you try the standard troubleshooting? Like restarting the phone or uninstalling and reinstalling apg?<br /><br />Also APG is actually great encryption, you&#039;re acting like we&#039;re going to give you a lecture on how insecure it is but it&#039;s really just as secure as any other PGP program as it&#039;s open source and supports large keys.

				tried restarting with no luck but will try uninstall and reinstall. I am glad to hear your support for agp. Honestly I heard comments about it being newer and others stating never use phones for encryption. Honestly didnt know but assumed the worse.

				Unknown object in stream?&nbsp; What version of Android is that, never seen that particular error?&nbsp; Well, regardless, when you say &quot;save my keys,&quot; what do you mean exactly?&nbsp; Are you trying to import other people&#039;s public keys, or are you trying to import your own private key?<br /><br />There&#039;s recently been a big to-do about a bug in the standard Java encryption library.&nbsp; Note that Android is built on Java; the vast majority of apps are written in Java, and it&#039;s likely that Java developers would naturally use the standard Java libraries.&nbsp; They&#039;re calling it an Android bug but it&#039;s really a Java bug and for all I know apg uses its own algorithm, but I wouldn&#039;t generate any keys in Android unless you really know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />Also, I think you may be confusing &quot;don&#039;t use phones for encryption&quot; with what people should be saying, which is &quot;don&#039;t ever trust a cell phone with your secrets.&quot;&nbsp; The entire device is insecure -- you aren&#039;t even the &quot;owner&quot; of the phone when you buy the thing (as in you don&#039;t have superuser permissions).

				It is very likely a Java error as described it does say something in the lines of java but I can not remember it exactly. I googled it and found lots of people with the same problem but no real answers. I am trying to import both other peoples keys as well as my own private key.
