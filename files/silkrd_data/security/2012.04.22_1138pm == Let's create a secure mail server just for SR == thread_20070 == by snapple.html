				Tormail is on its death-bed, Hushmail leaks like a sieve, and even if we did find a new secure mail option who&#039;s to say it&#039;s not a Fed honeypot or will shut itself down in a month?<br /><br />I recognize the need for a mail service that is: secure, anonymous, torified, reliable.<br /><br />What would it take for us to set up our own tormail? If it were created internally we could (almost) guarantee it&#039;s not run by the Feds. If we charged a reasonable yearly fee, payable in bitcoin, this would ensure it would stand the test of time. One bitcoin a year for reliable anonymous mail? I think this is possible. <br /><br />I&#039;ve run many websites, and running a mail server isn&#039;t THAT hard, however, there are some unique challenges presented in this hostile environment. <br /><br />Any maverick entreprenuers out there want to take this on?

				Would like to see something like this develop but anything like this would need to be totally independent of SR.

				That&#039;s the idea, right. A totally independent party develops a torified email service that charges a small bitcoin payment to cover the hosting and maintainence costs. <br /><br />I&#039;m on other onion forums and the lack of a reliable onion mail service isn&#039;t isolated to Silk Road.

				In theory it isnt too hard so there must be some reason why there isnt a reliable service, first identify weaknesses of existing products as to not fall at the same steps :)

				The best vendors we know have been running their own Tor-hidden mailservers for a while. The rest of us were stuck with Tormail (which &quot;should&quot; be &#039;up and running&#039; again within a week or two).<br /><br />But indeed any &quot;trusted&quot;, public, Tor-based hidden mail service would be great. As long as you are using GPG, it shouldn&#039;t matter &quot;too much&quot;. Just use public or otherwise anonymous wi-fi if you have IP concerns.<br /><br />Though, an &quot;SR-based&quot; mail-server would be the shit. And something we would happily pay for. :)<br /><br />If SR can get away with this for over a year now, we would trust in any Tor-based hidden service SR might provide. :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew

				Then there is one point of monitoring all the communications if you centralize mail for just this site. Nothing stopping whoever runs this site from downloading the Privacybox.de source code and setting it up themselves, then vendors can upload public key and all communication is encrypted. Set claws mail to directly download messages from tor privacybox<br /><br />

				&quot;Centralizing&quot; email means nothing....with &quot;any&quot; provider....&quot;if&quot; you are using GPG with an email client and have complete control over your private key(s)... :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew
