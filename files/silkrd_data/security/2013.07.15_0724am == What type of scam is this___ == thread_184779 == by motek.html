				It&#039;s weird, because if you go to any product page, they want you to either contribute or pay to get access, so it might be a phishing site, but it also might be a scam site, or one of those &quot;added value&quot; sites.<br />

				FUCK<br /><br />He got me. What do I do? He&#039;s logged onto my account right now and is asking people to FE. I got a request to join Atlantis and i fucking did. Then got logged out of SR and now I cant get back in. Now when I view the account people are saying FE as requested like 56 seconds ago. Holy crap.<br /><br />The site that I joined I used the same loggin details but not the same pin code. Am I FUCKED????? I got thousands in ESCROW.<br /><br />I have asked SR support to reset but they arent responding

				It looks like a semi legit value added site. Basically it probably scrapes SR content, stores it in its own database, and then added a few features for searching by price, etc. What would be nice is if it let you search a keyword within a given category or categories as well as the price and other searches.<br /><br />But it should go without saying, NEVER use your SR username and password (or any other account) for more than one site, especially for vendors. Otherwise you leave yourself wide open to the use of that info to try to access your SR account. If they don&#039;t know your PIN that might help some to prevent funds getting transferred anyway, but right, they could msg your customers and such.

				Someone I know paid the $0.99 fee for a test run and gave me the login details. It&#039;s legit in that sense. It does allow you to browse the full site. However, you obviously shouldn&#039;t use the same login details on any two sites, and definitely not on this site.<br />
