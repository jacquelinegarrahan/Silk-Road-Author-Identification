				ok just recently i saw in my local news paper that someone got busted receiving marijuana in the mail in my city... now i know that doesnt mean he got it from SR BUT, does that mean i should NOT attempt any packages delivered to my address for a while being that they MIGHT be hunting for that now? im just worried that being the fact that they caught someone receiving marijuana in the mail, wont they be hunting for that now? and if i should STOP receiving packages for a bit till things cool down... how long should i wait to start receiving them again? <br /><br />like the post subject says, i might be paranoid but i REALLY dont feel like getting caught! and i know the rules... deny, deny and deny... lawyer up!<br /><br />anyone care to shed some light on this situation? i live in a small town and according to the feedback of my vendor... his stealth has never been an issue

				Do you know the details of the bust? Was it a ridiculously huge amount? Some people are just stupid.

				Way too paranoid. If you&#039;re vendors doing it right it won&#039;t make a difference. You&#039;d probably be amazed at how many drugs get mailed to your city, getting on SR isn&#039;t hard. You&#039;re kosher dude, just make sure you stick the vendors with mylar bags, good stealth, etc. <br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper<br />

				I agree. Carry on as usual and be careful. Stick with vendors with verified stealth techniques.. <br /><br />Good luck to you.

				He got caught with 2 ounces and a .32 caliber handgun... This is a bible thumping state so they made a HUGE deal about that... And ok thank you for all your advice. My package came today and I immediately hid it for a bit... As soon as I realized an hour came by and everything looks normal I stopped worrying...

				Since the guy got caught with a gun, it probably got way over hyped and in the media that means money.&nbsp; Just be smart. and safe and you should be fine..

				Paranoid. You have any idea how many drugs have been/are currently/will be in the mail in every single city of the United States? 1 guy in your town getting caught with weed is pretty good odds actually. That means everyone else who received marijuana via the mail that day DIDN&#039;T get caught. Glass.. half full..
