				&nbsp;Please contribute advice for extending a wifi signal and sharing the original network&#039;s internet access among users connecting to the secondary signal.<br /><br />&nbsp;As an example, I&#039;m capturing internet via network adapter A. I would like to retransmit the internet access of that network by establishing an adhoc network with adapter B. Both adapters are plugged into one computer.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m also interested in hearing any alternative methods which can accomplish the same function... of sharing internet with a system that is beyond the reach of the currently established network.<br /><br />&nbsp;I hope someone has already done this and can offer experiential knowledge.

				Yu need two point to point wifi transmitters.&nbsp; About $60 each.&nbsp; &nbsp;You program them and point them at each other up to 15 km away .&nbsp; But they need line of sight which means they have to see each other. Even if it takes a laser or a scope/telescope to line them up .&nbsp; &nbsp;I set them up all the time.<br /><br />Then on each end you would put them outside mounted on a wall roof or pole.&nbsp; the cable into the house .&nbsp; Then Ito yur router /computers.<br /><br />Any homemade antenna boosters are junk.&nbsp; &nbsp;You need these point to point devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some wifi routers can be used for this purpose as well.&nbsp; They function as both point to point and wifi hotspot .&nbsp; &nbsp;Get one of those, but they are a little more.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy.<br />

				I think it&#039;s awfully common these days for routers to double as signal repeaters.&nbsp; That&#039;s what you really need, IMHO: a wifi signal repeater is pretty cheap, very easy, and it works.&nbsp; Or it&#039;s supposed to anyway, I&#039;ve never had reason to use one myself.&nbsp; Basically they amplify and retransmit signals and nothing more.&nbsp; It looks to the client connecting to the network as though it&#039;s connected to the same server as always, except the signal&#039;s being repeated.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen a line of sight setup, but that makes perfect sense... WiFi is pretty limited by design so that it&#039;s possible for several to exist in the same area.&nbsp; Line of sight would allow you to beam a stronger signal without worrying about it fucking everybody else up because it radiates 365 degrees.&nbsp; So I guess it depends on how far you want to extend your network.&nbsp; Personally I&#039;d try a signal repeater if the specs sounded right.

				if they are line of sight go with an amplified directional antenna, otherwise amplified omni directional antenna.

Receive the signal via adapter A, and then create an adhoc network with shared internet using adapter B.<br /><br />I really appreciate all your input, and anymore you may have. I&#039;ll continue researching and providing information as I find solutions.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to lookup more information on signal retransmitters like you&#039;ve described. I thought I was essentially going to be doing that with the two adapter scheme... but I haven&#039;t gotten it to work so...

				1. get a 2 yegi antennas with a high dbi rating and a 1w adapter for each side.&nbsp; you can get a 2w adapter if you&#039;re not concerned about goverment agencies picking up on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Point the antenna&#039;s at each other.<br /><br />3. Tada!
