				So the only way is thru dealing directly with cash? Seems like there is no other way to buy bitcoin directly. I mean if you cannot use paypal or debit or credit card. So, cash is basically the only other option. hmm. Well, this may sound like very newbie-ish but bitcoin is not very convenient. And not everyone on the planet is concerned with security. Even if it WAS traceable, in some countries the government would not bother. So, if the vendor and the receiver from such countries then it wouldn&#039;t be such a big deal.

				Bitcoins are the only way on SR. It is not like they are hard to get, hell if you are not worried about traceability then use virwox<br /><br />https://www.virwox.com/<br /><br />Paypal or CC to buy L$ then use the L$ to buy bitcoin on that exchange. However, they will have you validate your account with copies of your ID or passport if there riskapi tags your account and my guess is it will!<br />
