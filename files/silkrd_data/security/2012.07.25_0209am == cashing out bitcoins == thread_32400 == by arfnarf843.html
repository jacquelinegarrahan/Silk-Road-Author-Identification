				What is the preferred method of withdrawing bitcoins that could possibly be somehow watched by 3 letter agencies?&nbsp; Is simply using a mixing service enough, or could some complex analysis actually just show what you are up to?&nbsp; Another problem I could imagine is you swap your bitcoins for ones that are also just linked to drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard about the moneypaks but don&#039;t you need a verified debit card to withdraw cash from those?&nbsp; Do you guys just get info and register under a fake name or something along those lines?<br /><br />I figure some kids here are going to say not to discuss this here but I think thats silly.&nbsp; I think its much more important to just have solid methods that are so good theres no way to prevent it, like tor &amp; this site in general, then to rely on keeping secrets from law enforcement.<br /><br />Thanks guys.&nbsp; This sites awesome.

				If you&#039;re familiar with Moneypak, than you can give someone BTCs for a Moneypak in exchange. You don&#039;t need a verified debit card as you can actually just send it to your PayPal. There would be no link to drugs through Moneypak.<br /><br />Also, you can throw your coins through a tumbler and send them to another BTC wallet set apart from the SR. Afterwards, they will have little to no trace to any drugs. After that, go to bitmarket.eu, set up an account, and make a listing on their market stating how many BTCs you have for sale and how much you&#039;re selling one for per unit. bitmarket.eu is a nice site for cashing out.

				This is the issue I am having. <br /><br />Previously I have moved from SR &gt; walletbit&gt; home wallet on computer &gt; walletbit (different account) &gt; intersango to cash out<br /><br />Now, however, walletbit are taking a fee (and have made their site more scary, warnings about information being passed to authorities and account reviews etc.) and intersango are causing people lots of people problems, it seems (you are now only allowed one account, for instance).<br /><br />So what is the safest way of taking BTC from SR and cashing out in GBP? What are the dangers and how easily can BTC be traced to their source?<br /><br />Thanks for your help.

Then, create an account on bitmarket.eu and sell them there. After you send the BTCs through a tumbler, you should be golden and the washed BTCs will not link back to the SR.
