The whole thing reeks of a scam but they have shipped a few Jalapenos out in an attempt to prove their legitimacy and [I think] they&#039;re shipping out about 10 - 20 units per day. That in itself would suggest that they are not going to be able to fulfill the majority of the orders placed with them.<br /><br />A sad situation in any event - likely going to be posted on the ever-growing wall of Bitcoin scams.<br /><br />Oh and there&#039;s that +1 I owe you.<br /><br />Libertas

				I don&#039;t disagree with any of this. The question is, when do the Butterfly rigs start shipping? If the answer is never because they&#039;re either vaporware or are like digital Madoff, then the difficulty will take much longer to increase.

Even the SR reddit has one apparently : (<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well Avalon has already shipped 1 batch of their 3-module rigs (66 GH/s). and Butterfly Labs has sent out a few jalapeños (5 GH/s). Other than that ASICMINER has built a nice amount of ASICs that slide into a chassis into a rack for large-scale production. There are several on auction on Bitcointalk.org&#039;s forums currently. So they have shipped, just not mass-shipped. <br /><br />Whether it&#039;s worth investing depends on your outlook for FIAT. If you consider every bitcoin made using a mining rig a hedge against the failure of FIAT then it&#039;s a great investment as with the USD and EU performing poorly. Otherwise you will drive yourself crazy trying to calculate your profits in FIAT. <br /><br />No, there&#039;s no SR mining pool. Nothing stopping anyone from setting one up, just that you&#039;d probably wouldn&#039;t get great rates compared to Slush or BTCGuild. <br /><br />In the end like all investments it&#039;s a calculated risk. All I can say is to research any company THOROUGHLY before you give them 1 satoshi. Lots of vaporware ASIC companies floating around. Personally I would only either buy ASICMINER shares or one of his Block Eruptor Blades as they exist, and are hashing currently just fine.
