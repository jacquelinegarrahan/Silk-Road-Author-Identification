				Most people don&#039;t know about the existence of quantum computers. Almost no one understands how they work, but theories include bizarre-sounding explanations like, &quot;they reach into alternate universes to derive the correct answers to highly complex computational problems.&quot;<br /><br />Quantum computers are not made of simple transistors and logic gates like the CPU on your PC. They don&#039;t even function in ways that seem rational to a typical computing engineer. Almost magically, quantum computers take logarithmic problems and transform them into &quot;flat&quot; computations whose answers seem to appear from an alternate dimension.<br /><br />For example, a mathematical problem that might have 2 to the power of &#039;n&#039; possible solutions -- where &#039;n&#039; is a large number like 1024 -- might take a traditional computer longer than the age of the universe to solve. A quantum computer, on the other hand, might solve the same problem in mere minutes because it quite literally operates across multiple dimensions simultaneously.<br /><br />If you know anything about encryption, you probably also realize that quantum computers are the secret KEY to unlocking all encrypted files. As I wrote about last year here on Natural News, once quantum computers go into widespread use by the NSA, the CIA, Google, etc., there will be no more secrets kept from the government. All your files -- even encrypted files -- will be easily opened and read.<br /><br />***Clearnet link***<br />http://www.naturalnews.com/040859_skynet_quantum_computing_d-wave_systems.html

The bit strength of SHA-X is X, in certain circumstances the security strength could be less due to various attacks, but if collisons are found with less than 2^X probability then the hashing function lowers the security of the overall cryptosystem. No collisions have been found for any of the SHA algorithms other than SHA-1, which apparently had its security lowered to 2^60, meaning with a given file and hash value, you could find another file with the same hash value after producing 2^60 outputs. So it would be bad to use this hash algorithm produce a key for a symmetric cipher, because even if the password is 128 bits a collison producing the same output hash value could be found after 2^60 attempts.

				But you can key AES-256 with partial output from SHA-512. You would just split the output in half. But might as well just use SHA-256. I believe it is also debatable if it would be safer to use SHA-512 or SHA-256. I have read some things indicating that SHA-256 would be safer, but one cryptographer I talked with said he would make the case that it is equally safe to use half a SHA-512 output as it is to use an entire SHA-256 output.<br /><br />The thing is, cryptographic hash functions distill and evenly distribute randomness. At least, this is according to one thing I read a long time ago when I was first learning about cryptographic hashes, and I think it is true. So if you feed SHA-256 1 bit of entropy, the output 256 bits will have 1 bit of entropy evenly distributed through out them. This is the distributive property of cryptographic hash functions, the distillation property is that if you feed it 1000 bits of data which contain 1 bit of entropy, the output hash will have 1 bit of entropy in 256 bits of data. So if this is a correct understanding of cryptographic hash functions, it would seem that it would be safer to use SHA-256 to key AES-256, because let&#039;s say your password contains 256 bits of entropy. You feed the password to the hash function and the output hash has 256 bits of entropy. If you use SHA-512 and feed it a password with 256 bits of entropy, the output also has 256 bits of entropy, but now it is spread over 512 bits. When you take half of those bits to key AES-256, it would seem like you are only actually getting 128 bits of security, as each bit from the hash function has half a bit entropy due to the distributive property of cryptographic hash functions.<br /><br />I am not sure if this happens in practice. From what I have read about cryptographic hashing functions, it seems like it should happen this way, and that it would be safer to use SHA-256 for the hash function to generate a key for AES-256. But like I said, one crytpographer said he would argue that both methods are equally secure.

				A better answer from me would have been that the NSA probably actually cannot break all encryption, even with their multi billion dollar super computer. But even assuming they can, it doesn&#039;t mean encryption is worthless. If it takes them two days to decrypt a single message, why do you think they gonna spend two of those days decrypting your order for an ounce of bud.

No idea about ASIC or FPGA&#039;s though, I would assume they don&#039;t have this problem. All the encryption I&#039;ve seen to make containers and the like, are using SHA-512 (Schneier also advocates SHA-512, but says there&#039;s nothing wrong with any SHA-2) while all the software implementations to use bcrypt/encrypt databases, are using sha256, probably to avoid that password spreading problem you talked about when feeding in passwords to avoid the 72 byte limit (though Password1 is now using 512)<br /><br />Example:&nbsp; $h=crypt(hash(&#039;sha256&#039;, $p),&#039;$2y$......................&#039;);&nbsp; bcrypt and scrypt make it really hard for GPUs to crack anyways. There&#039;s also this, which is a bcrypt 256 implementation to separate keys from server and encrypt the hashes as well http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?a99d7b619aa2a028#Ey6MdAyxEywI7JAox7afg7wBBSf0bh/qS6wnQ2MD1OU=<br /><br />Meanwhile TC is using SHA-512, Whirlpool (512), and RIPEMD-160 hashes for AES256 keys. <br />

This would be a mathematical breakthrough MUCH larger than finding the Higgs Boson. What NSA have apparently done is weaken commercial encryption algorithms (usually by making the entropy generators less than random) so that they CAN break the encryption, but strong encryption is still strong. For instance, on a desktop pc it would take 6.4 quadrillion years to brute-force 2048bit RSA encryption. Working using conventional algorithms the D-Wave2 can compute problems 3600x faster (according to the wiki page - the only place I could find that had actual facts, no just glossy brochure crap), which still places it at taking 1.8 trillion years to brute force.<br /><br />Now, where quantum computers excel is in that they can execute Shor&#039;s algorithm - this can use unique properties of qubits to break encryption. Don&#039;t ask me how it works, I&#039;m working on learning about this kind of thing, but am not that advanced yet. However, this is not just some kind of magic spell any old quantum processor can manage, there are requirements. For starters, the noise needs to be low enough, but let&#039;s assume that is for now. The main point is that you need enough qubits. 512 qubits is very respectible, but as far as I can tell you need more qubits than the number of bits in the encryption key. Most sources say twice as many, did find this which suggest RSA768 can be broken with 1154quibits - about 1.5x the bit of the encryption key:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7457/fig_tab/nature12290_T1.html<br /><br />So, to crack a 2048bit RSA they would need around 3000+ qubits. 512qubits is respectible, but not enough.<br /><br />The final point is this - even if they did have a black box that could do this, it still takes some time and resources each time. They can&#039;t just decrypt everything in real time, and even if they could they do not have the HuMint resoruces to interpret it in real-time. The more encryption used, and the better the encryption, the harder and more costly it is for them and the more they have to use discretion over who they target.

You would just split the output in half. But might as well just use SHA-256. I believe it is also debatable if it would be safer to use SHA-512 or SHA-256. I have read some things indicating that SHA-256 would be safer, but one cryptographer I talked with said he would make the case that it is equally safe to use half a SHA-512 output as it is to use an entire SHA-256 output.<br /><br />The thing is, cryptographic hash functions distill and evenly distribute randomness. At least, this is according to one thing I read a long time ago when I was first learning about cryptographic hashes, and I think it is true. So if you feed SHA-256 1 bit of entropy, the output 256 bits will have 1 bit of entropy evenly distributed through out them. This is the distributive property of cryptographic hash functions, the distillation property is that if you feed it 1000 bits of data which contain 1 bit of entropy, the output hash will have 1 bit of entropy in 256 bits of data. So if this is a correct understanding of cryptographic hash functions, it would seem that it would be safer to use SHA-256 to key AES-256, because let&#039;s say your password contains 256 bits of entropy. You feed the password to the hash function and the output hash has 256 bits of entropy. If you use SHA-512 and feed it a password with 256 bits of entropy, the output also has 256 bits of entropy, but now it is spread over 512 bits. When you take half of those bits to key AES-256, it would seem like you are only actually getting 128 bits of security, as each bit from the hash function has half a bit entropy due to the distributive property of cryptographic hash functions.<br /><br />I am not sure if this happens in practice. From what I have read about cryptographic hashing functions, it seems like it should happen this way, and that it would be safer to use SHA-256 for the hash function to generate a key for AES-256. But like I said, one crytpographer said he would argue that both methods are equally secure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>SHA-512 is largely identical to SHA-256 isn&#039;t it?&nbsp; but operates on 64-bit, thus there are some computation artifacts of SHA-512 that make cracking programs like hashcat harder to use with GPUs, giving you a slight advantage to not being at the mercy of GPU cloud hashing. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know the specification of SHA-256 or SHA-512, but their output hashes are totally different for the same input. To protect from GPU cloud hashing attacks on password hashes you would use a PBKDF with a lot of iterations. Some GPU&#039;s can produce SHA-256 hashes really fast, particularly AMD GPU&#039;s, as explained below<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_a_GPU_mines_faster_than_a_CPU#Why_are_AMD_GPUs_faster_than_Nvidia_GPUs.3F<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Firstly, AMD designs GPUs with many simple ALUs/shaders (VLIW design) that run at a relatively low frequency clock (typically 1120-3200 ALUs at 625-900 MHz), whereas Nvidia&#039;s microarchitecture consists of fewer more complex ALUs and tries to compensate with a higher shader clock (typically 448-1024 ALUs at 1150-1544 MHz). Because of this VLIW vs. non-VLIW difference, Nvidia uses up more square millimeters of die space per ALU, hence can pack fewer of them per chip, and they hit the frequency wall sooner than AMD which prevents them from increasing the clock high enough to match or surpass AMD&#039;s performance. This translates to a raw ALU performance advantage for AMD:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; AMD Radeon HD 6990: 3072 ALUs x 830 MHz = 2550 billion 32-bit instruction per second<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nvidia GTX 590: 1024 ALUs x 1214 MHz = 1243 billion 32-bit instruction per second <br /><br />This approximate 2x-3x performance difference exists across the entire range of AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is very visible in all ALU-bound GPGPU workloads such as Bitcoin, password bruteforcers, etc.<br /><br />Secondly, another difference favoring Bitcoin mining on AMD GPUs instead of Nvidia&#039;s is that the mining algorithm is based on SHA-256, which makes heavy use of the 32-bit integer right rotate operation. This operation can be implemented as a single hardware instruction on AMD GPUs (BIT_ALIGN_INT), but requires three separate hardware instructions to be emulated on Nvidia GPUs (2 shifts + 1 add). This alone gives AMD another 1.7x performance advantage (~1900 instructions instead of ~3250 to execute the SHA-256 compression function). <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so yeah GPU&#039;s are currently more specialized for SHA-256 than SHA-512. However, by using a PBKDF you can strengthen your password by much more than you can by switching from SHA-256 to SHA-512. PBKDF will use SHA-256 (or whatever) and iterate perhaps a hundred thousand times. So if using SHA-512 takes twice as much time for the GPU to make a hash, using SHA-256 with PBKDF with 100,000 iterations will take 100,000 times as long. Of course you could switch to SHA-512 with so many iterations, but you can always just add more to SHA-256 as well. There is no problem to make key generation from a password take X amount of time with Y hardware, and it is just as effective to use a PBKDF with more iterations as it is to switch to a new hashing algorithm. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No idea about ASIC or FPGA&#039;s though, I would assume they don&#039;t have this problem. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think even GPU&#039;s have this problem theoretically, they are just not as optimized for SHA-512 as they are for SHA-256. Although it is probable that SHA-512 takes longer than SHA-256 inherently anyway, but as I said before you can use a PBKDF to make key generation take as long as you want on any given hardware. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All the encryption I&#039;ve seen to make containers and the like, are using SHA-512 (Schneier also advocates SHA-512, but says there&#039;s nothing wrong with any SHA-2) while all the software implementations to use bcrypt/encrypt databases, are using sha256, probably to avoid that password spreading problem you talked about when feeding in passwords to avoid the 72 byte limit (though Password1 is now using 512)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What are they using them for though, is the important question. Also, how are they using them. It is literally impossible to use a 512 bit output for an AES-256 key, AES-256 needs a key that is exactly 256 bits. The only way you could use a SHA-512 hash for AES-256 is if you only use half of the output bits. In which case I would probably just use SHA-256, since it matches up. If I was using a password based key and wanted to make an attacker spend more time to guess passwords, I would use SHA-256 with a PBKDF with as many iterations as the user could stand. I am not positive if the entropy distribution problem actually will come into play, but from what I have read on hash functions I would be afraid that it would. A cryptographer friend said he would argue that both methods are equally as secure. I noted that he didn&#039;t say they are equally secure. I would therefore lean toward caution by using SHA-256 to key a 256 bit encryption algorithm, rather than using half the output bits of SHA-512. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Example:&nbsp; $h=crypt(hash(&#039;sha256&#039;, $p),&#039;$2y$......................&#039;);&nbsp; bcrypt and scrypt make it really hard for GPUs to crack anyways.

Truecrypt produces keying material with its PRNG, the hash functions it uses as entropy distributors (entropy diffusers they call them). <br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/random-number-generator<br /><br />I can&#039;t really comment on the way their PRNG works. I would have done it a little bit differently, and more straight&nbsp; forward imo. After getting the raw input from mouse position etc, I would concatenate it together into a single buffer every few seconds, then take the SHA-256 sum. Then I would take this SHA-256 sum and use it as the basis for the next round, with new raw input being concatenated to the previous SHA-256 sum, and then after a few seconds the new value being hashed, etc, for however long the user desires. Another property of a cryptographic hashing algorithm is that the output hash should contain exactly as much entropy as the input fed to it. So if I feed SHA-256 1000 bits that contain 1 bit of entropy, the output SHA-256 hash should have 1 bit of entropy. If I use this hash for the basis of the next output, and concatenate 1000 bits with 1 bit of randomness to it, when I hash this the next SHA-256 output should have 2 bits of entropy. At this rate, it will take 256 cycles to have 256 random bits. Then I would key AES-256 directly with this hash value. <br /><br />Of course the hash value used to key AES-256 is not based on a password. Truecrypt generates a random key for AES-256 and then it encrypts this key with another key generated by the users password. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t use SHA-512 because I would be too worried that the user would only accumulate 256 bits of entropy, and that they would be distributed evenly thoughout the 512 bit output, leading to the AES key only having 128 bits of entropy. Though I suppose you could use SHA-512 and XOR every pair of bits together to get a 256 bit key. Or you could take the SHA-256 value of the SHA-512 value. Using half of the SHA-512 value seems risky though. And I don&#039;t see a reason to use SHA-512 and then SHA-256 versus just using SHA-256 to begin with. <br />

The pool, which is 320 bytes long, is filled with data from the following sources:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mouse movements<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Keystrokes<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Mac OS X and Linux: Values generated by the built-in RNG (both /dev/random and /dev/urandom)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MS Windows: Windows CryptoAPI (collected regularly at 500-ms interval)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MS Windows: Network interface statistics (NETAPI32)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MS Windows: Various Win32 handles, time variables, and counters (collected regularly at 500-ms interval)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So essentially Truecrypt is describing the buffer from the scheme I mentioned, where raw input data is added (from mouse position, etc). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Before a value obtained from any of the above-mentioned sources is written to the pool, it is divided into individual bytes (e.g., a 32-bit number is divided into four bytes). These bytes are then individually written to the pool with the modulo 28 addition operation (not by replacing the old values in the pool) at the position of the pool cursor. After a byte is written, the pool cursor position is advanced by one byte. When the cursor reaches the end of the pool, its position is set to the beginning of the pool. After every 16th byte written to the pool, the pool mixing function is applied to the entire pool (see below).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Truecrypt diverges here, after they fill the buffer up they don&#039;t ever replace it but rather they modify it. When new input comes in after the buffer is filled, they change the value of the current position in the pool to be the current position in the pool modulo 28 the new raw input. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pool Mixing Function<br /><br />The purpose of this function is to perform diffusion [2]. Diffusion spreads the influence of individual &quot;raw&quot; input bits over as much of the pool state as possible, which also hides statistical relationships. After every 16th byte written to the pool, this function is automatically applied to the entire pool.<br /><br />Description of the pool mixing function:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let R be the randomness pool.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let H be the hash function selected by the user (SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, or Whirlpool).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; l = byte size of the output of the hash function H (i.e., if H is RIPEMD-160, then l = 20; if H is SHA-512, l = 64)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; z = byte size of the randomness pool R&nbsp; &nbsp;(320 bytes)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; q = z / l – 1&nbsp; &nbsp; (e.g., if H is Whirlpool, then q = 4)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; R is divided into l-byte blocks B0...Bq.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; For 0 &lt; i &lt; q (i.e., for each block B) the following steps are performed:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M = H (B0 || B1 || ... || Bq)&nbsp; &nbsp; [i.e., the randomness pool is hashed using the hash function H, which produces a hash M]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bi = Bi ^ M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; R = B0 || B1 || ... || Bq<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now Truecrypt divides the buffer into sections that are the size of the output of the hash function selected by the user. Truecrypt goes through each section and generates a value that is equal to the hash value of every section in the buffer, and then uses modular exponentiation to transform the current section to the current section ^ value generated by the hash function. It does this for every section in the randomness pool. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For example, if q = 1, the randomness pool would be mixed as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (B0 || B1) = R<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B0 = B0 ^ H(B0 || B1)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; B1 = B1 ^ H(B0 || B1)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; R = B0 || B1<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Generated Values<br /><br />The content of the RNG pool is never directly exported (even when TrueCrypt instructs the RNG to generate and export a value). Thus, even if the attacker obtains a value generated by the RNG, it is infeasible for him to determine or predict (using the obtained value) any other values generated by the RNG during the session (it is infeasible to determine the content of the pool from a value generated by the RNG).<br /><br />The RNG ensures this by performing the following steps whenever TrueCrypt instructs it to generate and export a value:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Data obtained from some of the sources listed above is added to the pool as described above.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The requested number of bytes is copied from the pool to the output buffer (the copying starts from the position of the pool cursor; when the end of the pool is reached, the copying continues from the beginning of the pool; if the requested number of bytes is greater than the size of the pool, no value is generated and an error is returned).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The state of each bit in the pool is inverted (i.e., 0 is changed to 1, and 1 is changed to 0).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Data obtained from some of the sources listed above is added to the pool as described above.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The content of the pool is transformed using the pool mixing function. Note: The function uses a cryptographically secure one-way hash function selected by the user (for more information, see the section Pool Mixing Function above).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The transformed content of the pool is XORed into the output buffer as follows:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The output buffer write cursor is set to 0 (the first byte of the buffer).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The byte at the position of the pool cursor is read from the pool and XORed into the byte in the output buffer at the position of the output buffer write cursor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pool cursor position is advanced by one byte. If the end of the pool is reached, the cursor position is set to 0 (the first byte of the pool).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The position of the output buffer write cursor is advanced by one byte.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Steps b-d are repeated for each remaining byte of the output buffer (whose length is equal to the requested number of bytes).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The content of the output buffer, which is the final value generated by the RNG, is exported.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Truecrypt then uses this randomness pool to generate keying material, first going through some steps to transform it a final time. <br /><br /><br />I think that this is kind of an over complicated method personally. I would do something more like this:<br /><br />Have the buffer that raw input is added to, every period of time (or better yet every time the buffer is filled), I would take the SHA-256 value of the buffer. Then I would totally clear the buffer, and add the SHA-256 value to it. Then as more input comes, I would add it to the buffer past the SHA-256 value, and when the buffer is filled again I would take the SHA-256 value of it again. I would do this for some number of rounds, or as long as the user desires. At the end, I would take a final SHA-256 value of the buffer. If I was only generating an AES-256 key, I would use the final SHA-256 hash for the key. However, Truecrypt is using their PRNG to generate more than the key, so I would need more than 256 bits. In this case, I would do the following:<br /><br />Using the final SHA-256 output as a seed, I would then hash it out once more. If S is the original value and O1 is the hash of the original value<br /><br />Ox = H(S || Ox-1)<br /><br />O1..Oz would be my pseudorandom material to use for keying and other operations, where Oz is the final Ox.<br /><br />The original seed is generated securely because:<br /><br />A. Cryptographic hash functions preserve entropy, meaning the output of H(X) contains as much entropy as X. <br /><br />Therefore, with R = raw input<br /><br />H(R1) = A<br />H(A || R2) = B<br />H(B || R3) = D <br /><br />D must contain as much entropy as the total entropy of R1, R2, and R3 combined. <br /><br />B. Cryptographic hash functions distill entropy<br /><br />If H produces 256 bits of output, feeding H(1000 non-random-input-bits + 1 random-input-bit) = 256 bit output with 1 random bit (due to preservation of entropy there is 1 bit of entropy in the output, distilled from 1001 bits to 256 bits)<br /><br />C. Cryptographic hash functions distribute entropy<br /><br />If H produces 256 bits of output, H(1 bit of entropy) = 256 bits each with 1/256 bits of entropy <br /><br />therefore if there are 256 bits of entropy total fed to H during the seed generation process, the final value will be 256 random bits. <br /><br />The final output material is secure because:<br /><br />A. The seed is used to generate every 32 bytes of output <br /><br />Ox = H(S || Ox-1)<br /><br />Without knowing the seed value an attacker cannot use Ox to determine Ox-1 or Ox+1, because a cryptographic hash algorithm is (ideally) a one way function.<br /><br />H(S) = O1 (the attacker can not determine the seed from the first output because doing so would mean H is not a one way function)<br /><br />H(S || O1) = O2 (Same as above, plus the attacker can not guess O2 with knowledge of O1 unless they also have knowledge of S, and S is 256 bits of randomness)<br /><br />H(S || O2) = O3<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />It should be safe to use randomly sized sections of output as well, since the entropy is evenly distributed by the hash function. That means just because the hash outputs A9 and A is used for the publicly viewable salt and 9 is used for the secret key, the attacker should not be able to use knowledge of A to be able to determine that the key starts with 9, since the entropy of A is the same as the entropy of 9 and the two are probabilistically independent of each other.

None of them seem to directly make such a claim, but some people take the claims they make to imply it. In computer science quantum computers are actually kind of controversial it seems to me. Traditional computer scientists seem to dismiss them in many cases, but perhaps it is just because they don&#039;t know enough about them. Even cryptographers used to dismiss them, but they seem to be more and more accepting of the fact that they are real now. I think that quantum computers kind of go beyond traditional computer science and more into the realm of advanced physics applied to computation. Certainly that is the case with quantum cryptography, which is very different from traditional cryptography and has a very physics oriented slant to it. (IE: Traditional cryptography you may scramble a plaintext and transmit it on the line, such that if it is intercepted it cannot be deciphered between location A and B. With quantum cryptography, you may use quantum teleportation to transfer a plaintext from point A to point B such that it does not exist at any point between A and B to be intercepted in the first place.) <br /><br />On the other hand, I don&#039;t think it has ever been proven that prime factorization is NP-complete, so perhaps quantum computers theoretic ability to trivially factor massive numbers into primes doesn&#039;t imply that P = NP, but rather implies that prime factorization was never NP-complete to begin with. So just because a quantum computer can factor huge numbers into primes doesn&#039;t mean that there has been an answer to P vs NP, but is more likely to imply that some problems thought to be, but never proven to be, NP-complete, were actually never NP-complete to begin with. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What NSA have apparently done is weaken commercial encryption algorithms (usually by making the entropy generators less than random) so that they CAN break the encryption, but strong encryption is still strong.

Working using conventional algorithms the D-Wave2 can compute problems 3600x faster (according to the wiki page - the only place I could find that had actual facts, no just glossy brochure crap), which still places it at taking 1.8 trillion years to brute force.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A true quantum computer with enough stabilized qubits is allegedly able to trivially break RSA and ECC and DH and most public key encryption.

It is true that right now it looks primarily like the NSA has subverted cryptography via influence over the standards as well as releasing some backdoored things, such as the PRNG dual_ec_drbg. However, the NSA is also very likely at the cutting edge of quantum computing, and that is a risk to take into account as well. On the other hand, the NSA is also at the cutting edge of traditional computing, and it is possible that their super computers are merely trying to brute force passwords and crack smaller traditional encryption keys (like RSA or DH 1,024). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now, where quantum computers excel is in that they can execute Shor&#039;s algorithm - this can use unique properties of qubits to break encryption.

However, this is not just some kind of magic spell any old quantum processor can manage, there are requirements. For starters, the noise needs to be low enough, but let&#039;s assume that is for now. The main point is that you need enough qubits. 512 qubits is very respectible, but as far as I can tell you need more qubits than the number of bits in the encryption key. Most sources say twice as many, did find this which suggest RSA768 can be broken with 1154quibits - about 1.5x the bit of the encryption key:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7457/fig_tab/nature12290_T1.html<br /><br />So, to crack a 2048bit RSA they would need around 3000+ qubits. 512qubits is respectible, but not enough.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds right, nice source I have never been able to find exact numbers for how many qubits are required to break an X bit RSA key.

				This is of course assuming we have properly implemented crypto, without deterministic random numbers. It seems a lot of us don&#039;t, and there&#039;s definitely some tricks being used at the NSA to lower the entropy of public key cryptography according to Schneier, who&#039;s upped his key to 4096 since 2048 RSA/OpenSSL/PGP is no longer reliable. <br /><br />We&#039;re all likely running backdoored machines. Intel HW RNG is almost certainly diddled (https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/surreptitiously.html), ethernet cards and chips are all proprietary source, most likely backdoored (https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/hosting_backdoors_in_hardware), toolchains and compilers are suspect and require multi signed builds to compare just to ensure they haven&#039;t been backdoored (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html) Linux code is a fucking shambles these days and we all essentially lucked out Theodore T&#039;so who maintains /dev/(u)random prevented Torvalds and RHEL developers from forcing exclusive Intel RdRand TRNG and ditching the CSPRNG pool or else all our crypto would be completely useless. https://plus.google.com/117091380454742934025/posts/SDcoemc9V3J<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s time to start building tiny Lisp machines with FPGAs (http://www.aviduratas.de/lisp/lispmfpga/) and using TRNG from a reverse-biased PN junction powered by two 9volt batteries in a shielded box just so we can send each other provably secure messages. Either that or OpenBSD Loongson/Lemote laptops.

				looks like Truecrypt uses the same hash functions for their PBKDF as well<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Header key is used to encrypt and decrypt the encrypted area of the TrueCrypt volume header (for system encryption, of the keydata area), which contains the master key and other data (see the sections Encryption Scheme and TrueCrypt Volume Format Specification). In volumes created by TrueCrypt 5.0 or later (and for system encryption), the area is encrypted in XTS mode (see the section Modes of Operation). The method that TrueCrypt uses to generate the header key and the secondary header key (XTS mode) is PBKDF2, specified in PKCS #5 v2.0; see [7].<br /><br />512-bit salt is used, which means there are 2512 keys for each password. This significantly decreases vulnerability to &#039;off-line&#039; dictionary/&#039;rainbow table&#039; attacks (pre-computing all the keys for a dictionary of passwords is very difficult when a salt is used) [7]. The salt consists of random values generated by the TrueCrypt random number generator during the volume creation process. The header key derivation function is based on HMAC-SHA-512, HMAC-RIPEMD-160, or HMAC-Whirlpool (see [8, 9, 20, 22]) – the user selects which. The length of the derived key does not depend on the size of the output of the underlying hash function. For example, a header key for the AES-256 cipher is always 256 bits long even if HMAC-RIPEMD-160 is used (in XTS mode, an additional 256-bit secondary header key is used; hence, two 256-bit keys are used for AES-256 in total). For more information, refer to [7]. 1000 iterations (or 2000 iterations when HMAC-RIPEMD-160 is used as the underlying hash function) of the key derivation function have to be performed to derive a header key, which increases the time necessary to perform an exhaustive search for passwords (i.e., brute force attack) [7].<br /><br />Header keys used by ciphers in a cascade are mutually independent, even though they are derived from a single password (to which keyfiles may have been applied). For example, for the AES-Twofish-Serpent cascade, the header key derivation function is instructed to derive a 768-bit encryption key from a given password (and, for XTS mode, in addition, a 768-bit secondary header key from the given password). The generated 768-bit header key is then split into three 256-bit keys (for XTS mode, the secondary header key is split into three 256-bit keys too, so the cascade actually uses six 256-bit keys in total), out of which the first key is used by Serpent, the second key is used by Twofish, and the third by AES (in addition, for XTS mode, the first secondary key is used by Serpent, the second secondary key is used by Twofish, and the third secondary key by AES). Hence, even when an adversary has one of the keys, he cannot use it to derive the other keys, as there is no feasible method to determine the password from which the key was derived (except for brute force attack mounted on a weak password).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would be hesitant to go that route personally because of concerns due to entropy diffusion (I used to say distribution but seems everybody calls it diffusion so time to switch my terminology.

Digesters are designed in Ron Rivest&#039;s words to be secure in that, &quot;It is computationally infeasible to find two messages that hashed to the same value. No attack is more efficient than brute force.&quot; Thus, if we hash a series of random samples, it is not practical to learn what those samples were. Note that this is the same thing as my definition of the output&#039;s being perfectly random, and thus the hash preserves the entropy found in the samples. This has the additional useful effect that many weakly entropic samples can be combined to carry entropy equivalent to the whole of the entropy of all the samples. Note that while these hashes distill entropy, they cannot hold more entropy than their size. They are bottles that you can shake up entropy in, but a 128-bit hash cannot hold 129 bits worth of entropy.<br /><br />These characteristics make them excellent functions for our purposes. Common functions used today are MD2, MD4, and MD5 (done by Ron Rivest), SHA (the US government&#039;s Secure Hash Algorithm, also known as SHS, the Secure Hash Standard), GOST (the Russian hasher), RIPE-MD, and RIPE-MD160 (which are European standards for hashes).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2004/31520493/clean.pdf <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; The tools used to derive a uniform key from these sources of imperfect ran-<br />domness are often referred to as randomness extractors.

My concern about using SHA512 to produce a key for a 256 bit symmetric algorithm is that if only half of the output of SHA512 is used, perhaps only half of the randomness of the password is used, if the password contains less than 512 bits of entropy. <br /><br />PBKDF2 doesn&#039;t XOR together bit pairs of the output, or take the SHA256 value of the output. It keeps running SHA512. So they really are keying AES-256 with partial output from SHA-512. I would love for someone to explain to me why entropy diffusion after hashing a password with less than 512 bits of entropy doesn&#039;t lead to a weakened key when half of the 512 output bits from the hash are used. I did ask about this in the past and someone said he would argue that using part of a SHA512 hash like this would be just as safe as using SHA256, but he didn&#039;t explain why or seem 100% certain. I would imagine it is safe or else there would be warnings about it with PBKDF2 or something I imagine, but to me it doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />If hashing an input uniformly distributes its entropy into the output, and the input has 256 bits of entropy, and the output has 512 bits, it seems that each bit of output has half a bit of entropy, and therefor taking 256 bits from this output to key AES-256 would have 128 bits of entropy only. Again, love for someone to explain to me why I am wrong (I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if I am, but I just don&#039;t see why), or explain to me why it is better to use half of a SHA512 hash versus just using a secure hash that produces the number of bits needed to key the symmetric algorithm in the first place. <br /><br /><br />In the case of using a hash function that produces less than 256 output bits I wouldn&#039;t see this concern, because the PBKDF can stretch the randomness of the password into an arbitrary length stream, but when using a hash function with more than 256 output bits it seems that although it can stretch the randomness of the password into pseudorandomness still, the entropy will still be diffused throughout the output bits (meaning with 256 bits of randomness in the password, you still have 256 bits of entropy in an arbitrary number of 512 bit outputs, but each of the output bits only has half a bit of entropy), which would seemingly cut the effective entropy of the password in half if it isn&#039;t enough to fill the limit of the hash function used (because 256 bits spread over 512 bits of output means each bit has half a bit of entropy, and when you use half of the final output to key the 256 bit algorithm, it means your key only has 128 bits of entropy. Or if your password has only 30 bits of entropy, the key has only 15 bits of entropy, since 30 bits of entropy diffused over 512 bits means each output bit has .05859375 bits of entropy, and .05859375 * 256 used bits = 15 bits of entropy).&nbsp; <br /><br />However even in the case of using a hash function with 160 bits of randomness, it seems that the limit of the security would be 160 bits. You can stretch a 160 bit seed out to an arbitrary length stream, but cracking the initial seed will always allow you to generate the entire stream. This is easy to prove, assume you have a single random bit, it is either 1 or 0. You can stretch this out indefinitely by hashing it with a counter for example, so:<br /><br />H({1,0}) = O<br />H(O || 1) = O1<br />H(O1 || 2) = O2<br /><br />but this only has 1 bit of security, because the attacker knows you either started with 1 or with 0. So I think you can stretch the initial entropic seed out indefinitely, but the total security of the system cannot be larger than the initial seed. So using a 160 bit hash function for the PBKDF to key a 256 bit algorithm means you cannot have more than 160 bit security. <br /><br />So I am not sure how I feel about ANY of the hash functions that Truecrypt offers! Either we can use a 512 bit hash algorithm and diffusion of entropy will cut the effective keyspace of most passwords in half (it seems to me, please tell me why I am wrong), or we can use a 160 bit hash and the security of AES-256 is actually limited to 160 bits, since passwords with more than 160 bits of entropy don&#039;t contribute additional entropy to the PBKDF output . Why don&#039;t they include a 256 bit hashing algorithm??

Just like you should not run untrusted software, you should not install hardware provided by untrusted sources. Unless you work for something like a government intelligence agency, though, you shouldn&#039;t realistically worry about installing commodity hardware from reputable vendors. After all, you&#039;re already also trusting the manufacturer of your processor, RAM, etc., as well as your operating system and compiler providers. Of course, most real-world vulnerabilities are due to mistakes and not malice. An attacker can gain control of systems by exploiting bugs in popular operating systems much more easily than by distributing malicious hardware.&quot;<br /><br />So, don&#039;t worry, you&#039;re hosed anyway is the conclusion. Nice.<br /><br />Of course, that isn&#039;t much of a consolation for us end users.&nbsp; We do have tools we can fight back with.&nbsp; As long as we understand what&#039;s happening on our systems at least as well as a typical NSA employee.<br /><br />NSA employees, mind you, are still government employees, not super humans.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would take someone from a startup or an established and respected linux-heavy organization over an NSA employee any day of the week. NSA and other government employees lack experiences like going on death marches, 24 hour coding sessions, or any of that other fun stuff that comes with being dedicated to delivering the most impressive results possible while using as few resources as possible. Don&#039;t underestimate the value of operating in a free enterprise environment, it really does equip us so that we have an opportunity to defend ourselves - if we study our systems closely.<br /><br />That said, crypto is clearly nothing more than the equivalent of a timer-based lock - after a certain amount of time has passed, the crypto we used will be well below the standard of the day and will be easily crackable. OTP is the way to go. Government cracking crypto has no impact on government crypto, because anything that matters is OTP.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t trust the basic tools in Linux (you should...) why not boot directly to bash or something else by using init=/bin/bash or something like that on the grub kernel options line?&nbsp; I&#039;ve dissected grub more than once, and am totally comfortable putting my name on grub being free of backdoors... This approach seems relatively secure - I know a taxi TV service that does what I&#039;ve just described - since you only bring up services as you see fit, and as necessary.<br /><br />Compile SystemTap tapsets that detect any attempt to &#039;phone home&#039; or perform any similar unauthorized behavior, and put them into use.&nbsp; You can do some pretty amazing things with systemtap.<br /><br />Concerns about the integrity of toolchains and compilers leads me to proposing a busybox-based system with uClibc in place of glibc. <br /><br />Using a raspberry pi with a stripped down system might make you marginally safer than you would be otherwise. But I bet using this system will attract A LOT more unwanted attention than using a more run of the mill system would.<br /><br />Just a basic Linux system can be locked down pretty securely these days...&nbsp; I don&#039;t care a thing about what NSA or other supposed watchers might have inserted into Linux source code, it is audited and reviewed, and your example of Theodore T&#039;so saving the random day strengthens my belief that the systems in place for auditing code at that level are sufficient.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I would go with a .deb or .rpm based system, or something else, a la DIY slack style or gentoo, if security was the primary concern.&nbsp; I would want SELinux and SystemTap, I have audited the source code for SELinux very thoroughly (at one point that was the only way to figure out wtf it did...) and I am comfortable deploying SELinux on hundreds of production systems with a targeted policy.&nbsp; SystemTap is just awesome.<br /><br />Does Linux From Scratch have some inherent problems I am unaware of?<br /><br />Bottom line, you&#039;re going to have to trust someone to write some code, you can&#039;t do it all unfortunately.<br /><br />OK, now an &#039;easy&#039; question: what do you think about LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup)/ dm-crypt for full disk encryption?&nbsp; I think it works well for USB disks, anyone have an opinion on this topic they would be so kind as to share with me?<br /><br />Thanks

The quantum uncertainty based systems transmit data from point A to point B such that it cannot be intercepted at any of the points in between without the interception being immediately detected by the people at point A and B. So with quantum teleportation you would teleport a symmetric key from point A to B and then use that to encrypt data which you transmit over the line as normal (or you might be able to teleport the entire plaintext), with quantum uncertainty based systems you would transmit the keying material and if you detect an interception you would generate new keying material and try again (perhaps after finding where the interception was carried out on the line, and capturing the enemy spies trying to steal your information).

				I was researching quantum computers months ago and if I remember correctly I learned that it is just a misunderstanding that quantum computers can break all encryption. It is apparently only certain encryption applicable to Shors algorithm. If I remember I was left being totally comfortable with TrueCrypt and my PGP key.... One big feeling in the computer security industry though is why people even care about front door brute force attacks when the side windows are always completely open. No need for the NSA to break your PGP password when they can oh so much easily just take over your computer and watch what password you type in.

Brad Spengler, of grsecurity and the PAX team has nothing but disdain for Torvalds. Read @grsecurity on twitter sometime. Linus is constantly sabotaging his own kernel. It&#039;s chock full of drivers from the 1990s you can exploit to your heart&#039;s content that haven&#039;t been maintained in 20yrs. You can fake emulation of an old ethernet card and load it up into the kernel, look up ancient exploits for it and go to town to get root, unless grsecurity/PaX is installed. <br /><br />Kernel is now approaching 16 million lines of code. That&#039;s insane. Nobody can audit that. You will have to build a custom kernel and rip literally everything out of it except the drivers you yourself expect to use, and route modprobes to /bin/false to prevent hardware backdoors. <br /><br />Something else the Intel engineers brought up was VPS systems with no human interaction, like Whonix. Tor requires CSPRNG to init encrypted (by ECC) routes. Well, whonix has this running on it&#039;s own isolated VPS with no user interaction. Remember /dev/random does not know if the entropy pool is insufficient to provide PRNG, it will do so anyways. I asked Matthew Green about this and he assumes the entropy would be very low. This means it could be possible for feds to decrypt your Tor traffic easily. Again... as petty drug dealers would they give a shit once they factor ECC (of which Schneier assumes they can do) to low enough entropy and discover just a random weed dealer? Probably not. But they might just kick that down to the DEA anyways since the origin of how you were found will be protected by lying to the court, so why not. <br /><br />Yeah this sounds paranoid, but why take the chance. You can configure linux kernel to use fortuna for PRNG, and keep on using whonix without worry, or start an mp3 on boot and sample entropy from it, or just use BSD instead with yarrow and other solid PRNG built into the kernel that actually checks it&#039;s entropy pool before handing out CSPRNG unlike Linux. <br /><br />I emailed Stallman and asked him what he&#039;s using these days. He&#039;s still using a Yeesong/Loongson netbook (last one was stolen in Argentina, bought a new one) with totally open firmware, initializes the machine with PMON and his chosen distro is gNewSense, He uses emacs for everything including emails and literally does nothing else on it except programming in Lisp. He still emails himself scraped webpages in plaintext preferring not to directly expose himself to exploits and advertisements, though he&#039;s buffering lynx output straight into emacs anyways I don&#039;t see how that could happen, but I&#039;m not Stallman. <br /><br />Lately been attacking OTR and browser js implementations and finding literally all crypto engineering clownshoes. It&#039;s amazing more of us aren&#039;t busted. We have really, really bad crypto tools, and terrible CSPRNGs. No wonder the cloud wants to become our feudal security lords. Everything available to us is truly garbage, with a few exceptions. <br /><br />Speaking of garbage, I just found my countermail key IN FULL inside my JVM garbage collector just sitting there in memory, and it&#039;s random numbers are pencil and paper solvable. Lol. I also wrote a deterministic PRNG that overrides silently the countermail page and feeds 123123 repeating and it was accepted by the javascript execution environment without questions. After that I wrote an invisible DOM attribute that backdoors routines and just deposits the key in cleartext on my desktop. Granted these attacks require also bypassing TLS, but countermail is just using RC4 128bit, already revealed to be broken. Debian Iceweasel on my test system defaults to TLS 1.0, which is wide-open vulnerable. <br /><br />Everything is broken, severely. No wonder the NSA has free reign over the internet right now.

Torvalds also has an incredible amount of problems with RHEL developers, many of them hilarious when he rages at their stupidity.

If you seed haveged with a fixed 0 you will also pass the tests with success, and your CSPRNG entropy will nonetheless be nil since it can be determined. Again asking anybody like Matthew Green if a statistical test is worth anything while auditing RNG and his answer will surely be no.

				In regards to my concern about Truecrypt using a 512 bit hash algorithm to gather entropy for keying a 256 bit symmetric algorithm, I have found out why it is not insecure for them to do this. The issue was that I had a misunderstanding of what it means for a hash algorithm to evenly distribute entropy of the input into the output. <br /><br />My original fear was that since a hash function evenly distributes entropy of the input to the output, that feeding a 512 bit hash algorithm with 256 bits of entropy would produce an output of 512 bits each containing half a bit of entropy, meaning taking 256 bits of this output to key a 256 bit algorithm would result in the key having only 128 bits of entropy. This is not correct, and the problem was my understanding of the meaning of &quot;evenly distribute entropy of the input into the output&quot;.<br /><br />In reality, if you feed a 512 bit hashing algorithm 256 bits of entropy, each output bit will have 1 bit of entropy, up to 256 selected bits. This is not very intuitive to me, but it makes sense when you think of it as follows. Imagine there is an algorithm that takes a fair coin flip (producing a 1 or a 0 with equal probability) and outputs the input bit followed by the opposite of the input bit. Feeding this algorithm a 1 will then produce 10 and feeding it a 0 will produce 01. Now the entropy of the coin flip is 2^1 because the result can be either 0 or 1 with equal probability. The entropy of the second bit is also 2^1 then, because it can also be a 1 or a 0 with equal probability. So after feeding this algorithm 1 bit of entropy, the output contains two bits each with 1 bit of entropy, this is what is meant by evenly distributing the entropy of the input into the output. However, note that the output string itself also contains 1 bit of entropy, because it is either 10 or 01, so 2^1 possible states. So even though each individual bit of output has 2^1 entropy, the entire output string also has 2^1 entropy. This can hold true even if the algoritm repeats the pattern, feeding it a 1 produces then 10101010101010, and each individual bit in that pattern has one bit of entropy, but the entire string also has 1 bit of entropy because it is either 10101010101010 or 01010101010101, 2^1. So when you feed SHA512 256 bits of entropy, you can take the first 256 bits and they contain 256 bits of entropy, or you can take the second 256 bits and they contain 256 bits of entropy, even though the sum entropy of the 512 output bits contains 256 bits of entropy total. Any individual 256 bit selection from the 512 bits contains 256 bits of entropy, the even distribution of entropy doesn&#039;t mean that each of the 512 bits contains half a bit of entropy. <br /><br />Just thought I would clear that up.
