				Even though im not sure about what an E-wallet is? although it seems pretty self explanatory.<br />Every site i&nbsp; have hit, including Bitcoin client is a miss for me.<br />I need to understand how to Deposit money to convert to Bitcoins? or deposit Bitcoins?<br />&nbsp;Just when i think i understand this, i continue reading and get more and more confused :(<br /><br />Is there a simplified way, (with security of course) to get money to my ewallet,&nbsp; or SR. or where ever i have to deposit to to begin transactions?<br />Must i go to a Bank and transfer the money? Or can i find a way to deposit online without being traced that isn&#039;t too difficult for me to follow though. (.yes i know this is probably a pipe-dream but i have to ask.)<br /><br />I want to purchase goods and of course cannot seeing as i can&#039;t figure this gibberish out lol..Grrrrr<br /><br />Im sure there are other questions i am forgetting to ask but for now, my main concern is which site to use for Canada, and HOW to purchase Bitcoins to use HERE.<br /><br />Please help!!!!<br />Thankfully newb&#039;d<br /><br />Dz

				Yesterday I had the same question you have, today I have bitcoins. Here&#039;s what I did:<br /><br />Part 1 - Create Wallet<br />1) I opened up Firefox and went to https://blockchain.info/<br />2) Along the top menu I clicked on &#039;wallet&#039;<br />3) I clicked on &#039;create my free wallet&#039;<br />4) I entered a 10 digit password twice (remember this!) -&nbsp; and hit enter<br />5) My wallet was created, It&#039;s some crazy long dashed hexadecimal number - copy and paste this into a text file somewhere so you can reference it later when you need to re-login if auto-fill doesn&#039;t do it&#039;s job. <br />6) I went back to https://blockchain.info/ , clicked on &#039;wallet&#039; and then &quot;login now&quot;<br />7) The crazy hexadecimal number appeared as my identifier and I used my super secret 10 digit password THAT I DIDN&#039;T FORGET from step 4<br />8) I was now logged into my wallet and saw 0.00 BTC $ 0.00 which means no funds BUT at least I was ready to stock it up<br />9) I copied my crazy hexadecimal identifier number like I was going to paste it somewhere else ...<br /><br />Part 2 - Buy Bitcoins, Fund Wallet<br />1) I opened another browser tab and went to https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/ <br />2) Where it says &quot;I will be paying with:I selected &quot;TD Bank Payee / Cash at Branch&quot;<br />3) Where it says &quot;I want buy &lt;drop down box&gt; worth of bitcoins&quot; I selected $100<br />4) I entered a valid email address<br />5) Where it says &quot;My wallet address to deposit the bicoins in is&quot; - I pasted my crazy hexadecimal identifier number from Part 1 and selected &#039;validate&#039;<br />6) My wallet number was validated, I know this cause the box went all green and I got a message saying so.<br />7) I went to my valid email account and saw a new email from &quot;Canadian Bitcoins&quot; <br />8) The email told me to go to a TD bank branch (any branch will do) and deposit a specific dollar and cent amount into a given account number <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (very important to be precise to the penny cause that&#039;s how they know it&#039;s you making the cash deposit) into a bank account # - you can ignore the stuff about adding a personal payee<br />9) I wrote down the account number (as well as the specific branch and account holder info) and took it with me to my local TD bank along with the exact dollar and cent amount to be deposited<br />10) I talked to a teller and deposited the cash. It was like she did this everyday - no ID needed, completely anonymous. <br />11) I went home, brought up my blockchain wallet by re-logging into https://blockchain.info/ and saw ... nothing, no deposit amount<br />12) I kind of freaked cause I&#039;d never done this before and thought I&#039;d just lost $100. Oh well.<br />13) went to bed, woke up, logged into https://blockchain.info/ and saw ... my bitcoin deposit amount <br /><br />That is all. Hope it helps <br /><br /><br />

				I AM NO EXPERT but from what I have read experienced so far the purchase of bitcoins in Canada is not something that can be done without leaving a trail unless you are a complete computer genius BUT the purchase of bitcoins is not a crime..&nbsp; I have read suggestions that would say do not transfer these coins directly to SR ( I have read that there is a train... I have read about a tumbler to redirect the trail) personaly I will be moving the coins prior to transfering them to SR.&nbsp; as I learn more I will be increasing the security in this area.<br />Buy thru exchange (hard to hide in Canada)<br />Transfer to a wallet<br />the wallet that I transfer them to will always be a new one and never reused<br />Then since I am a small buyer I plan on then moving these coins to my SR account<br />for larger purchases I would look at bitfog&nbsp; &nbsp;but they have a fee <br />I have seen a mixer mentioned but am still researching<br /><br />I AM NOT SAYING THIS WAY IS SECURE but this is where I am starting&nbsp; any additional easy steps sure would be considered<br />

				cavirtex is a good Canadian BTC exchange market with options that don&#039;t require you to setup an e-wallet.<br /><br />For example, you can walk into an RBC bank and request to deposit cash into cavirtexes business account, they (cavirtex) only require that you notify them before you make the cash deposit.&nbsp; They also accept wire-transfers.<br /><br />That being said, there seems so much good information in this thread already that my suggestions have already probably been trumped by better options ppl have mentioned.&nbsp; Nevertheless they are a good exchange market and i&#039;d still suggest you look into them :)

				RBC asked for id when making cash deposit to cash into cavirtexes business account so there is a trail at this point. I dont feel that it is a threat but would prefer to eleminate any trail when possible.

				I just used Cavirtex recently for the first time (my first deposit ever). It went fluently well. The funds were in my account within 4 hours. They charge $3 for depositing funds under $300. Once your funds appear in your account, you can buy Bitcoins, they normally charge a 3% fee for this. After you have your Bitcoins you can transfer them to your e-wallet or anywhere else you want.<br />&nbsp;

They just give you a friendly smile and sometimes comment on the weird decimal place with the deposit. <br /><br />1. Open Cavirtex account. I recommend using a tormail account for anonymity.<br />2. Enter the amount you will be depositing. NOTE: your deposit amount must end in the last two digits of your cavirtex account number. So if your account ends with 83 and you want to deposit $100, you&#039;ll be actually depositing $100.83<br />3. Go to a BMO with the banking information found on the cavirtex website. You will be making a deposit, not a bill payment. Make sure you have the company name as well (some numbered Alberta account). Keep your receipt. I&#039;ve had to email them a scan in the past. As mentioned, they now take $3 on smaller deposits.<br />4. Buy BTC on cavirtex. <br />5. Wash them a couple of time through instawallet or your bitcoin wallet of choice.<br />6. Transfer to your SR account.<br />7. Buy drugs.<br />8. Be happy. <br /><br />Never tried canadianbitcoins.com - gonna have to look at that option as well. Thanks wackmanblu!

				I&#039;m also Canadian and new here and to the whole Bitcoin thing.<br /><br />I got a bitcoin.org wallet and it took a few days to download the blocks.<br /><br />I discovered that the Canadian Virtual Exchange www.cavirtex.com requires some paperwork and photo ID copies at the bank, so I didn&#039;t bother with them.&nbsp; Lazy me.<br /><br />With a simple phone call to my bank to set up a direct payment I was able to make 2 transfers from my online bank website into my wallet with www.canadianbitcoins.com and my regular email (check the SPAM folder) without even leaving home.&nbsp; It took a day for the bitcoins to be confirmed as transferred into my bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />Using my real name and a normal web browser, everything was legal up to this point.&nbsp; After this, prefer anonymity using Tor and a new alias to register on Silk Road, BlackMarket, their forums, TorMail, TorPM, etc.&nbsp; You can do business with bitcoins anonymously over the dark net but eventually you&#039;ll still need to give your trusted vendor a name and real address to be shipped to.<br /><br />I shopped around, decided what to get, and from my Silk Road shopping cart saw the bitcoin amount I needed to tranfer from my bitcoin wallet.<br />It took several hours to transfer from my bitcoin wallet to Silk Road to make my first purchase.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of any other options in Canada.&nbsp; FYI, I have no affiliation with those sites.<br /><br />That&#039;s my .02 - hope it&#039;s helpful.<br /><br />~RutGroove<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I searched &quot;Canada&quot; for secure shipment through customs tips &amp; info to discover several<br />Canadian Bitcoin Setup threads (for someone to consolidate?):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » In Canada, need help on How-to deposit bitcoins to ewallet?:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36189.msg413702#msg413702<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Difficulty buying Bitcoins in Canada:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=43002.msg467054#msg467054<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Security » Help in Canada????!!!:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47493.msg500896#msg500896<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Silk Road forums » Discussion » Silk Road discussion » Method you use to acquire bitcoins, Canadians only please.:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47841.msg502838#msg502838<br />Also, I posted this info here:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BlackMarket Reloaded - Forums → Newbie Questions:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewforum.php?id=8<br /><br />FYI, here&#039;s an interesting post about shipping to Canada from a rogue Canadian Border Service Agent (CBSA):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11469.0<br />

You can set up an account online, but yes you do have to go to bank and deposit money to their business account and in a couple hours its available for you to buy btc. Banks should not ask you for ID to deposit money, some tell may because they don&#039;t know any different. If asked you can tell them you don&#039;t have any and it&#039;s not required, if they persist, go elsewhere, simple. <br />

You can set up an account online, but yes you do have to go to bank and deposit money to their business account and in a couple hours its available for you to buy btc. Banks should not ask you for ID to deposit money, some tell may because they don&#039;t know any different. If asked you can tell them you don&#039;t have any and it&#039;s not required, if they persist, go elsewhere, simple.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Been using Cavirtex now for a couple months and have had great luck with them....I tried to set them up as a bill payee for online banking....this is when you need to verify who you are( needless to say I never finished this method)... cash deposits at banks don&#039;t require id.....In a small town thou most tellers dont need ID to know who you are.<br />There customer service has been great when I needed it.

				So who&#039;s rates are better?<br />Canadian Virtual Exchange doesn&#039;t post how much.&nbsp; Only highs and lows. ( www.cavirtex.com )<br />The Canadian Bitcoins rates change throughout the day.&nbsp; ( www.canadianbitcoins.com )<br />Also, FYI:<br />bitcoincharts.com/charts/virtexCAD<br />bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD (CanadianBitcoins.com movements seem to follow this more)<br /><br />~ RutGroove<br />Might be persuaded to leave the dungeon to cash deposit for a good rate.
