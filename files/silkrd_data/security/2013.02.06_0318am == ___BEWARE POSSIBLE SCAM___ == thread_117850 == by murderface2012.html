				Yeah, it&#039;s 100% a scam.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same people spamming the forums advertising other scams like &quot;virwex&quot; and &quot;bitcointalks&quot; and &quot;bitkoin&quot; and &quot;mtgix&quot; ... same people, same spammy scam .... you just don&#039;t see a whole lot of it because we try to delete it as soon as it is posted.
