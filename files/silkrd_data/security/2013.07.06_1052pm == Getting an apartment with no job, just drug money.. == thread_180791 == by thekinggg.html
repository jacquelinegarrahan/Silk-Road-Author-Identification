				Usually they want first and last months rent plus a security deposit. Oftentimes they want proof of income as well, but this is not always the case. Most places have 6 or 12 month leases but I have seen a rare few that will rent on a monthly basis. The places that rent by the month usually charge significantly more per month than the places that rent by the half year or year (something like 100-200 extra dollars per month), but they don&#039;t care if you can prove income or not since you pay as you go. Paying for a 6 month or 12 month lease up front in cash is not unheard of but it is usually done by rich kids or young people freshly hired into jobs with big signing bonuses. It is even possible that paying for it in cash up front could get you flagged as a drug dealer or producer, I have seen plenty of propaganda that instructs people that paying for a place up front in cash is a warning sign. I would maybe look for a place that rents by the month if you are able to afford the premium cost. I had a friend who needed to get a place for only three months because he was traveling soon but his current lease had expired, and he managed to find a place that leased by the month. Of course it might look suspicious as hell if you rent by the month and stay at a place for a year lol.

				Depends on the landlord. If you go to an apartment complex owned by a big real estate company, they will probably want more paperwork from you than a little old lady who is renting her downstairs apartment.<br /><br />Try to find a landlord who is cool with paying in cash and not having any paperwork to prove employment. You can always say you have a legit job that pays you in cash. Waiter, landscaper, construction worker, etc.<br /><br />Most landlords just care about their rent money, and whether or not you will trash their place

				I wouldn&#039;t try to rent an apartment owned by a corporation. Having a sketchy/unverifiable job that pays in cash and having large amounts of cash to pay several months rent are all huge red flags that they will notice. Also trying to rent a really nice apartment (that appears above your means working construction) with cash is another one that tips them off. I would go for a house or a landlord that only has a few properties. Corporations don&#039;t give a shit if you can pay in cash, and where I live will not accept cash. Landlords with few properties on the other hand have no problem with that in my experience. I think I would say I was a college student if you are young. Of course there needs to be a college in your town lol.

				House would be preferable but if you&#039;re going to do the apartment thing, check google maps for any type of gradeschool or preschool or anything within 1000ft. Insta extra felony if you get raided.<br /><br />Also look for apartments near a local college. College students rarely work and most just assume parents are paying for everything anyway.

				easy , just find a nice friendly private landlord, that rents not through an agency and say you wish to rent an apartment for a few months your&nbsp; not sure how long exactly but you will pay by the month and will always pay on time, dont act like a hippy idiot, (because they will just think yor going to grow in the apartment) and dont act like a methhead, dress smart like&nbsp; a young guy who is just trying to make his own way in the world and start from the bottom and youl be fine.

				Years ago a guy I knew paid a friend to give him a job.<br /><br />Ex: you want an income of 2000 per month, and real tax deductions taken off the income. You offer 2500 to someone you can trust (and has a legit business) to put you on payroll.<br /><br />They are happy, and get some extra cash. You have a &quot;legit income&quot; and can now prove it. You can also deposit the cheques. If anyone ever asks buddy about you, you called in sick that day, are on another site, etc.<br /><br />I never tried this myself, but it might work for you.<br />

				Check personals and Craigslist. People are always looking for a roommate.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want a stranger, find a friend in the same situation as you. I always see my friends on facebook making living arrangements. Then have them do all the paperwork. Say you don&#039;t have credit(which, if you&#039;re young is probably true).<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to find a place to live without a job. Just gotta think outside the box!

				If you use a fake paystub they will verify the employer.&nbsp; If you have a friend that runs a website or something you can work from home, you can put them down as a reference and if he verifies the info he will call your friend.&nbsp; It would be helpful if you already had a real job and were earning a lil extra on the side from your extracurricular activities so that you would easily photoshop your current paystub and just fudge the numbers a bit.,&nbsp; That way when they call your real employer to verify if you work there or not, it would be legitimate.&nbsp; They can&#039;t verify your funds even if they asked your employer. Rarely will they ever ask how much you make.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You should have a real job either way&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the fuck you&#039;re thinking, quit being a lazy fuck.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re vending on SR, I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re selling drugs locally which means you will get busted in no time.

				It may not be a good idea to pay months in advance like others are suggesting because its fairly common for drug dealers to do that and anyone discerning may catch on. Other than that everyone else has been correct about looking on places like craigslist, the classifieds can also be a treasure trove. Beware of slumlords though. They don&#039;t give a shit where the money comes from and you&#039;ll be soon to find that they don&#039;t give a shit about a lot of things. I had one crib recently where the roof pretty much collapsed and flooded the place and the landlord took his sweet ass time fixing it and even though it wasn&#039;t very habitable he still demanded rent money. Elderly homeowners are definitely the way to go. They&#039;re very easily convinced and most of the time they don&#039;t even live in the same state as the property and are too busy trying to enjoy their golden years to want to check every aspect of your life. Also, depending on whats available don&#039;t be scared off by landlords that live on the property either. I&#039;m not sure if landlords can verify your employment simply with your ssn but I&#039;ve lied plenty of times about where I worked and all they ever seemed to do is call my &quot;employer&quot; (me or a friend with disguised voices, google voice is your friend for these kind of things). You could go the fake stub route too to help seal the deal but be wary of real estate agencies and complexes they have a lot more resources to pay for background investigations.

				Get someone else&#039;s payslips who has a good job, and forge them to have your name on them and just apply normally (with fake references if necessary), and offer to pay the first couple months upfront. They never ask questions.<br /><br />Do a cash deposit into your landlords bank account each week/fortnight/month instead of a bank transfer, they won&#039;t even generally notice you are not doing an account-to-account transfer and if they do it won&#039;t raise any red flags.<br /><br />If you are running a criminal enterprise DON&#039;T have many people come to your house for any reason. You should have more fingers on your hands than you have people who know where you live. I can&#039;t stress this enough.
