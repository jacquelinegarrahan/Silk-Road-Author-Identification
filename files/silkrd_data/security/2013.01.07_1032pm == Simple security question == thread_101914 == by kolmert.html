				Alright so I only plan on ordering for personal use, and never HUGE amounts of anything. Just small personal amounts. Would it be worth the money to buy a cheap laptop to use just for the purpose of buying through SR completely anonymously? Or do I really not have too much to worry about buying only small amounts. And if I do decide to get a dedicated SR laptop should I go somewhere with free Wi-Fi or should I be fine accessing SR through my home connection? Thanks for any advice you guys can provide!&nbsp; :D

				The levels of paranoia in this community.<br /><br />If you&#039;re buying personal amounts, there&#039;s about a zero chance that you will get a controlled delivery, so it&#039;s a waste of money to buy a second computer. If you&#039;re really worried, put TBB and your PGP program on an encrypted thumb drive and you&#039;ll be fine.

				It&#039;s not even that I&#039;m that paranoid.. I&#039;m just trying to be safe about things. My habits are well hidden from family and friends and the last thing I want them to do is find out, lol. Especially by the cops arresting me for buying drugs online. Thanks for the reply though. I won&#039;t even worry about buying a 2nd laptop.
