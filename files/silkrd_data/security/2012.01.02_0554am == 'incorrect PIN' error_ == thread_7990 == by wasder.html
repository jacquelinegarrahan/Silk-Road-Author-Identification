				I&#039;m trying to send some BTC to another member but keep getting &#039;incorrect PIN&#039; error. I enter the pin that previously worked but no longer seems to work. Would appreciate any help as I have no clue as to what to do next.

				Was there a moment in which we were prompted to set a PIN before doing anything else?&nbsp; I don&#039;t even remember setting one, and although I have a good idea what I would have set it to, those PINs are not working.

				I am having the same problem. I NEVER had a pin to begin with, now it is asking me to enter one, then after failed attempts it said it reset it. I haven&#039;t been on SR for a long while and don&#039;t remember there being a pin or having one.
