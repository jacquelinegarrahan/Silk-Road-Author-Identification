				If I were to disconnect to Tor while using Tails with a few bridges would my IP be revealed?<br /><br />Or is this not possible and would you just disconnect without anything being revaled?<br /><br />Is there anything I can add to tails to add an extra layer?

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Stop being so paranoid TMan, the Tor browser only works when tor is connected and running, if Tor disconnects then all activity will halt. You should worry more about your browsing activities when using clear net.

				something hit me that i missed - curious why the perceived need for VPNs &amp; bridges to conceal the use of TOR?<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;m not sure what purpose it serves, as there are a multitude of users using it for legitimate activity, just for the sake of privacy. Is it just part of that &quot;not standing out&quot; in general internet traffic? - ie, being part of the larger population of internet users, that do not use the TOR network?<br /><br />

				Tor Browser is configured to use localhost port 9150, so if Tor dies, the connection will fail. However, other apps, most notably bittorrent apps, can bypass the proxy settings and connect over clearnet.<br />
