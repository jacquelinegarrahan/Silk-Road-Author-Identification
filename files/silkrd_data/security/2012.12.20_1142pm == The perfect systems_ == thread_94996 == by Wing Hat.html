				I posted in the Off Topic thread earlier, but it seems these questions would go best here.<br /><br />I use the term &quot;perfect&quot; loosely because I know nothing is really perfect. Especially in the cyber world where counter measures and counter-counter measures are always popping up. But I can&#039;t help but ask all of you (whom I can guarantee know truckloads more about this stuff than I do) what you thing is the best possible setup is as of right now for each of these functions:<br /><br />(feel free to erase my novice compilation and replace it with your own, better equation)<br /><br />The Best Possible System for anonymity:&nbsp; Always use someone else&#039;s wi-fi, always run through Tor, and use proxy servers<br /><br />The Best Possible System for Pirating:&nbsp; Always use someone else&#039;s wi-fi, tpb, peerblock<br /><br />The Best Possible System for Dealing:&nbsp; Always use a pre-paid phone that doesn&#039;t require any personal information and minutes can be re-filled with a pre-paid card that ALSO doesn&#039;t require personal information<br /><br />The Best Possible System for Hacking:&nbsp; Always use someone else&#039;s wi-fi, use proxy servers<br /><br /><br />Please keep in mind that the above assumptions are coming from someone who.......in all reality doesn&#039;t really know jack shit about most of this technological stuff. Hell I don&#039;t even really understand the full concept of proxy servers and which one would be best?&nbsp; (I&#039;ve heard HideMyAss isn&#039;t that great anymore)<br />And I hate to be pessimistic, but I just can&#039;t see how the programs and books over at the SR marketplace on hacking emails and wi-fi could really be that easy. It&#039;s just crazy to me!<br />Anyway, I guess you could say I&#039;m looking for input from &quot;specialists&quot; more or less that have been doing it for years without a hitch. It&#039;s extremely interesting to find out what you all know.

				Using someone else&#039;s WiFi isn&#039;t such a great idea, it may arouse suspicions when if you just use Tor then you&#039;re secure enough and there&#039;s one less third party who could see that you&#039;re up to no good.

				Another piece of advice for you: conducting serious business over Tor has problems associated with it.&nbsp; Some exit nodes (which you go through to talk to any computer that&#039;s outside of the Tor network itself -- which SR is contained completely within) run SSL stripping software and use the Tor network to perform man-in-the-middle like attacks.&nbsp; Always question any data you get from an exit node.

				Using someone else&#039;s wifi isn&#039;t as foolproof as it sounds, and depends a lot on how it is done. People have distributed cp through their neightbor&#039;s wifi. The neighbor got raided, but after LE found no cp at that house, the investigation widened and the culprit was eventually busted. There are only so many neighbors that can access someone&#039;s wifi.<br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/24/unsecured-wifi-child-pornography-innocent_n_852996.html<br /><br />Parking in front of a random person&#039;s house is pretty suspicious and people have been busted doing that.<br /><br />Going to a random business with open wifi sounds like a good idea, but if you go to the same place often enough, you can get busted doing that too. They often have cameras, and it&#039;s a matter of seeing who was in the store every time the subject of interest was online. In a big city you may have enough options to rotate and never reuse locations, which would be the strongest protection.

				I swear.......how in the bloody hell did you guys learn all of this? I&#039;ve barely been scratching the surface and you guys are already blazing me with very helpful info. You guys are awesome!&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Ok, so I&#039;ll try to re-arrange it to achieve more cut and dry answers and I&#039;ll quit being so wordy and confusing.......<br /><br />What is your &quot;standard operating setup&quot; when it comes to torrenting?<br /><br />1. Do I need a vpn? If so, which one? I&#039;m not really sure how they work in Laman&#039;s terms.....<br />2. Do I need a proxy? If so, which one?<br />3. Is downloading through TPB a good idea or is there a better avenue?<br />4. Is utorrent a substantial program to use or is there a better one?<br />5. Is Peerblock even worth using?<br />6. So using my own home internet connection really isn&#039;t THAT risky or should I still try the random wi-fi thing?<br /><br />THANK YOU for any and all answers. You guys are really terrific.<br />

If you&#039;re concerned about a local observer, a bridge works fine and it&#039;s free. However, if you want to use a VPN, you should research whether they log or not, and prefer providers who accept bitcoins, which you can send anonymously. Of course, they may claim not to log but still do, which is why I don&#039;t put much faith in VPNs as an added protection.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94996.msg687108#msg687108">Quote from: Wing Hat on December 28, 2012, 05:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.
