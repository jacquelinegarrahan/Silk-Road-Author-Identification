				Guys I&#039;m fairly new to this but I decided to give it a try. I read some post and decided on which one was the best advice to follow(which was the starter guide). I did all the steps to the T, but my account with MT Gox was still fagged. Now my money is tied up in the mt gox account pending review. I had to send the my Drivers Licesnse information along with proof of residency. I need some advice how to get out of this situation. <br /><br />But besides that I see this as a huge problem to us SR users because to the ongoing monitoring systems when using a new currency like Bitcoins. I think it would be a better idea to cut out all the middle men(mt gox and such) and allow us to deal with SR completely. It would be a good idea to not only use SR for purchasing stuff but also for trading and purchasing Bitcoins if this is the currency that we&#039;re gonna use. This would insure our autonomy fully and I would be willing to pay a few for this extra service. SR is already offering a service with the escrow account all we would have to do is send whatever funds we wanted to our escrow account and SR deposit Bitcoins in the account to be used on this site. I think this is a wonderful idea. Whats your take on this?
