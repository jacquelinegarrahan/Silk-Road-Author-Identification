				Is this problem repeating itself over and over again? <br /><br />Have you tried quitting TOR then restarting? <br /><br />Have you tried to hit the New Ident button on TOR? <br /><br />Were you at one point to SR login (or a lookalike SR login page and were asked for your PIN? <br />(If so, then my friend, I hope your account is account is looked at immediately because its highly likely you have been phished. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				Do you get the full, 8?, character captcha below your username/password or do you get only 3 characters?<br /><br />If you get only 3 characters keep refreshing until you see the full 8-9 character captcha and you should be able to login.
