				So say someone was to simply download TOR onto their PC and start using SR, is that really so unsafe? Isn&#039;t your IP address hidden already, or are there other ways of finding out your identity?

				It&#039;s about as safe as going to one of the AIDS ridden states of Africa and having sex with people without using a condom.<br /><br />It really annoys me that people ask this because it is quite obvious to anyone with common sense that using the various safety procedures is absolutely necessary. Why do you think there are so many threads about them and so many people saying &quot;You should do abc/xyz/123/8910 over and over again. IMO people who ask this just sound like the can&#039;t be arsed to save their own arse which is a ridiculous attitude to take. It&#039;s true that LE are not really interested in the buyers on here, it&#039;s the staff/Mods/Vendors/Admin that they want but why chance it when you can just follow the steps and be 100% certain?

Raid follows.<br />[-] You made a mistake with TOR, and the DNS leaked to your ISP (their DNS log shows you been to SR). ISP passes your account info to LE. &lt;- If you want to make this mistake, its easy. Just try to visit SR when TOR is not active. Your browser tries to look up the SR onion address on your ISP&#039;s server.<br />[-] Your IRL friend/enemy narks about you<br />[-] Your vendor unfortunately was careless and got busted --&gt; Pleads the case down the case by narking about the clientele.<br />[-] Your vendor was LE<br />&nbsp;<br />More, and more....<br />
