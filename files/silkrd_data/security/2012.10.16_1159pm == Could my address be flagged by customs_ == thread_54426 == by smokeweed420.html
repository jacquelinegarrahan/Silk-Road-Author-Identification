				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am starting to get worried because i have been waiting many weeks on one order from germany(supertrips)&nbsp; and many weeks on another order (reship) from germany(sesampino). and recently another international order from the UK didnt show up.&nbsp; This whole time i have been getting every domestic order that i make but none of these international orders have arrived. my question is: if my address was flagged would i still be getting domestic orders? advice? comments? thanks

				I think it is possible because orders from international folks go through customs and customs is tighter than the postal service I imagine so maybe it&#039;d be an idea to kill international orders for a spell?<br /><br />From me though, I know you are a good guy and I don&#039;t want to see you go without your shit because that&#039;s just shit and it&#039;s no good for anyone.

				I&#039;m thinking the same thing you are <br /><br />for the germany orders however i seen a few posts (not 1 post accounts) show up after the 30 day mark, from 1 to 2 weeks after. Germany is having some shipping delays i believe. Also for limitless i&#039;m not sure, i am almost in the same situation you are but i am trying to keep hopeful. I will update back on this thread for any new info, US here.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as you but my orders are not nearly as big as yours. I&#039;ve been waiting for about a month for two international orders. They are both from reputable vendors that I have bought from before so I have no worries on that part. If you ordered from Lim he will take good care of you cause I&#039;ve had an order from him get lost in postage and he gladly sent a reshipment which came through. I hope your order comes in soon as well as mine!

				I use multiple addresses, if a package is seized I just dont use that address for awhile. But as far as I can tell whatever customs does, it does not cause all international packages sent to a certain addresses to be seized even after they find one.

				I think Customs would pass the address off to the DEA and it would be possible to flag the address but they are not looking for you they are looking for the supplier. This would be why they would show up at your address. They would press you and try to make your life miserable. But remember you never ordered anything. but you do remember someone you know had odrered some shit before and sent it to you address. <br /><br />DEA is going to approach there best oppertunity to get a supplier name so if they have you flagged just watch you deliveries and and there is nothing fishy with the package. <br /><br />Though, I don&#039;t think you need to panic, they are busy try to find out where the load of envelopes came from that came through O&#039;Hare Airport International post from China that was confiscated today came from. <br /><br />Also, there is a new synth. that is coming in from China&nbsp; that they are aggressively chasing down. I think everyone should be fine, but I might stay away from China for a bit.<br /><br />Good Luck to All!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If only a personal quantity was seized, Customs may inform the Police who might keep an eye on your place for a given period of time to gather any intelligence on your identity/movements before deciding on there next course of action. They could also just document the details and not pursue it any further because their chances of making a successful conviction are so low. Larger quantities are a different kettle of fish altogether. More money and resources are available if required because the &quot;prize&quot; the Police seek in these larger operations is substantially larger and &quot;news worthy.&quot; For Police to launch a preliminary investigation, they would certainly require more evidence than a letter containing 1 gram of your favorite gear. However, Tasmania is the place to be for the large quantities considered &quot;personal&quot; before being considered a commercial quantity. Basically around 25 or 28 grams (one of the two) for most drugs.

They could also just document the details and not pursue it any further because their chances of making a successful conviction are so low. Larger quantities are a different kettle of fish altogether. More money and resources are available if required because the &quot;prize&quot; the Police seek in these larger operations is substantially larger and &quot;news worthy.&quot; For Police to launch a preliminary investigation, they would certainly require more evidence than a letter containing 1 gram of your favorite gear. However, Tasmania is the place to be for the large quantities considered &quot;personal&quot; before being considered a commercial quantity. Basically around 25 or 28 grams (one of the two) for most drugs. Lucky 6 fingered pricks (lol).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well its definitely not personal amount, i lied about the amount on this thread because i was paranoid but its a lot more than personal. but it makes me feel better than a portion of my orders have arrived :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Relax. I dont think address flagging, at least by customs is even possible if you really think about it. Ive heard storys of blokes getting full Controlled Deliverys and having even more stuff in the mail so they have been bailed, released etc only for them to be shitting them-self about the next package on the way and for it to turn up without any problems 2-3 days after the CD.<br /><br />BC

				I know my buddy in Canada has his address flagged form ordering hookah tobacco from the states. i assume all his packages from international locations get checked now. I&#039;d just use different addresses everytime. Ask a friend who lives alone to grab the package for you. Don&#039;t tell them what it is, obviously. Flip them a $20 as a thank you. On to the next one
