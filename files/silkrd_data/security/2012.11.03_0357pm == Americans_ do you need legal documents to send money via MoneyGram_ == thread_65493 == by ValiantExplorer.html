				I am looking for as many ways to get BitCoins as possible, investigating various opportunities and evaluating risks. Since I live in Europe, my options aren&#039;t as good as for the USA.<br /><br />One of my ways could be to ask a close friend in the USA to MoneyGram some money into a BitInstant and then MTGox. <br /><br />But I want to reduce the exposure of this friend of mine as much as possible. So: do MoneyGram ask you for legal documents when making transfers?

				i recently used bitinstant and moneygram at cvs. the moneygram agent asked for my personal information (name, address and phone number) and the cvs clerk later asked for my id, which i said i didn&#039;t have, and the clerk decided it didn&#039;t really matter and took my money anyway. showed up in my account quickly.

				I&#039;ve done moneygram from a duane reade in nyc, have never been asked for ID or any such credentials. MoneyGram does ask for phone number, address, name, etc., but I&#039;m sure you can give fake info without consequences, as long as you remember your fake credentials each time (speeds up the process, don&#039;t have to talk to an operator since they already have your info). I just used my real because I feel like it doesn&#039;t matter at the quantities I buy/didn&#039;t think quickly enough. Next time I guess I&#039;ll start using a pseudo.

				Thanks for the info! :). After all, I think I might be onto some BitCoins with another (small) provider which apparently operates in Europe, so if that pans out OK (I have my doubts), it seems I won&#039;t have to ask my friend to even use a fake ID. He&#039;s an immigrant in the USA so I don&#039;t want to expose him to any risk as he waits for the Green Card. It would be kinda&#039; awkward to tell him to give fake credentials.<br /><br />This is mostly a last resort.

				Was curious due to the reports so tried this recently in 4 places with small amounts while on the road.<br />CVS wanted ID. They also wanted the address to match the ID. Maybe I just had an extra vigilant clerk both times. I felt like she gave me side-eye, but the whole thing was weird.<br />Walmart just wanted the form filled out, did not care that the address/phone were a hostel or equivalent. The interaction was characterized by apathy. This is how I like these things.<br /><br />Leaves me wondering how much money CVS is starting to lose on Moneygram transactions, and how much more Walmart is now making.

				It is true you don&#039;t need an Id but I got burned by this a while back.&nbsp; <br /><br />The person behind the counter screwed up and so the people on the receiving end couldn&#039;t get the $.<br />Then when I wanted to get it back I couldn&#039;t because I didn&#039;t have an ID showing the fake creds I used.<br /><br />All because some stupid bitch was to lazy to read the damn paper and do it right.&nbsp; I was pissed but there was nothing <br />I could do.&nbsp; When using fake creds just be sure they do it right.&nbsp; I mean as much as you can anyways.
