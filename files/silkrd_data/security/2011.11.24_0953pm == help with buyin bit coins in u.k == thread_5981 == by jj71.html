				Do you have a bank account ? MtGox (https://mtgox.com/) and Intersango (https://intersango.com/) take GBP deposits and exchanges them for Bitcoins.<br />Do you prefer using paypal ? You can use VirWox (https://www.virwox.com/) to buy SLL (Linden Dollars) and use these to buy Bitcoins.<br /><br />Fees are minimal with MtGox or Intersango (I recommend the latter), and quite important (20-40%) with VirWox. Create an account in these services or visit (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins) for more info.

				I used mtgox for the purchase of my first load of bitcoins. All it requires is an online bank transfer to their account (make sure to include the reference number they give you). The GBP were deposited to my account within 24 hours. From there you can &quot;trade&quot; bitcoins at the current rate or enter a lower rate that may or may not be matched in the future. Was fairly straightforward but I can&#039;t comment on any other methods of doing so!

				If you were to be using your bitcoins for illicit purposes you might want to use Intersango and deposit money into their Lloyds account in person, in cash. Just take the bank info with you (as well as the reference)

				Intersango or bitmarket.eu are the best.<br /><br />Bitmarket.eu especially is nice if you exchange with a person who is as keen for money as you are for their coins. You can have them within 2-4 hours if the bank transfer goes through instantly etc.

				For Intersango to identify your payment, you should include your personal reference which can be found on their website, in Account&gt;British Pounds&gt;Add Funds.<br /><br />To deposit the money to the Silk Road, create an account (if you haven&#039;t already), log in, and navigate to your account page (http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/account). There you will find a Bitcoin address (a long string of random characters) which you must send your Bitcoins to.<br /><br />To send the Bitcoins, go to Intersango.com, navigate to Account&gt;Bitcoins&gt;Withdraw Funds and copy your Silk Road address to the corresponding form field. Specify an amount and click withdraw.<br /><br />-<br /><br />If you want to make the transaction less traceable, send your Bitcoins from Intersango to an Instawallet (https://www.instawallet.org/) (don&#039;t forget the URL of your instawallet!) and from there send it to Silk Road.<br /><br />Bitcoin transactions are not instant, they can take 2-6 hours.
