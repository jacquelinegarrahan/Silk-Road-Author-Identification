				Hello, i receive this message today :<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />My name is Inigo, for those of you that don&#039;t already know me I am the Second-In-Command here on Silk Road. I control Vendor Support, Vendors Roundtable and a Global Moderator on the forum. I am using my Public Account instead of Vendor Support to be able to answer questions specific to this message. You can of course still contact me through Vendor Support or by PM on the forum you will find all the links to do so for your convenience at the bottom of this message.<br />With more and more sites being closed down or closing, most recently Atlantis though LEO involvement or not it is very disconcerting. I have spoken with DPR and we have agreed on a new venture which I will be heading. The need for a private site has increased. One that is exclusive to trusted buyers only invited by trusted vendors and doesn&#039;t have direct public access or knowledge. We have listened to seller’s feedback from here and the forums and with the amount of buyer scams on the rise we have decided to act. On the 27th of September we will be launching Silk Road 2.0 as a separate site to the main site. This site will be invite only and work on a web of trust method.<br /><br />As one of our higher ranking, trusted sellers we are inviting you to participate and be amongst the few to join. Sellers will be recruited from the main site when we feel they have gained our trust that they are reputable sellers. Buyers will only be invited by you, the sellers. This will be the web of trust working to best effect. You will also have your own forum section for the buyers and sellers to communicate.<br /><br />We will have a quick ban policy on any scams or scammers and they will not be able to re-join even if invited again. We are hoping to provide a safer, more productive site for you, our trusted sellers. We also hope because of the way the site will work we will see a better community evolve, and larger deals being able to be placed. Silk Road will still run in conjunction with Silk Road 2.0 and the general public will be none the wiser. As there will be no public knowledge the risk of ddos attacks or forced shutdowns etc. will be very minimal and it also provides a safe environment if the main site were down for a period of time.<br /><br />The site will go live on the 26th of September to enable you to get your listings up, intro&#039;s and to get a feel for the new site. There has been a few changes but you will find it very similar to the main site in look and feel. The address will be silkroadiplkjo7t.onion.<br /><br />As a trusted vendor the price of the vendor bond for joining with this invite is ฿1.93 which is half the fee on the main site this is limited to the first 250. This amount will be credited back to your account after 10 sales. After that time the fee and bond will be the same as the main site. Your unique btc address to send the payment to is 14NmTWyTHKvhoPqb1M65mHTyBNReQsx1jT<br /><br />Once the payment has been matched and confirmed you will receive the address of your new page with a link to register and build your store. Please do not release the new address to any buyers here or on the forum until after 27th of September.<br /><br />We hope you join us in this new and exciting venture.<br />In Liberty,<br />Inigo.<br /><br />Vendor Support - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/support<br />Forum Profile - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?acti<br /><br />BEWARE
