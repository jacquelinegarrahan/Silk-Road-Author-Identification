				He&#039;s either&nbsp; a scammer or a cop. First 2 transactions were mysteriously cancelled then 2 positives came in the same day the day after he posted his items. I call shenanigans! Glad I&#039;m not just being paranoid and others see this guy as what he is. (Douche, that is whether scammer or cop)

				I don&#039;t know why his listings (or he) for that matter, are still listed. I messaged SR with this same info before posting to the forum and he told me thanks for the head&#039;s up. Hopefully the crack and coke heads will read this before they fall for him and try to buy. Sad that people have to learn the hard way. Then again, I see sellers with 1 out 5&#039;s all over the place (never received, etc, etc) and and folks still continue to buy from them. <br /><br />Anyway, like my new signature ;)? Thanks to SR Pharmacy&#039;s idea in the no guns thread! <br /><br />

				WOW! Just a newbie here.All new to me here,but was going to start with this seller as my first.Decided to read about the forums and learn the ins and outs first,and get a feel for things(plus very nervous about my first time).I tell you what! So very glad I did.I feel 100 times better about this now.I just need to pay attention to what ALL the members are saying,because nothing gets past you guys.Awesome to see that most look out for the group and SR protection.Thanks for not letting this stupid newbie get off to a bad start with this seller. Plus all the tips you all post in your comments they really helped me out!

				Is 6.23% to the people that made this place for all of us REALLY too much to pay ColoradoGold? Seriously why would anyone trust you enough to do an out of escrow transaction when half of the feedback that you do have is negative and the other half is fake? Get a life, for real. Shitting on SR and skirting the fees is just disrespectful and stupid. Not a great way to introduce yourself to the community.
