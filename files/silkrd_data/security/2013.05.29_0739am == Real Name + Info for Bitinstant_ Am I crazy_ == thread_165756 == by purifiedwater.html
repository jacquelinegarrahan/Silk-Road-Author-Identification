				Would it be a terrible idea to use your real info for Bitinstant?<br /><br />I&#039;ve got the moneygram scripts right in front of me, and it asks for a lot of info.<br /><br />If I run this by Walmart tomorrow with fake info, I&#039;m still using my clearnet IP.<br /><br />If the feds were really trying to grab me by the ass, using a fake name at Bitinstant itself would be rather incriminating, wouldn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Anyway, I plan on doing it tomorrow regardless. Just haven&#039;t decided on a fake name and address yet.

				Pro Tip: If a clerk every asks if you used Zip Zap or Moneygram say NO! IF you say yes and she looks you up in the system if any of the info is different the transaction will get halted.&nbsp; :o So if you&#039;re going to lie keep the lies straight and use different places for bitinstant payments.

				Use Tor with BitInstant. And use a fake name, phone number, address, email, etc. They won&#039;t ask for ID.

				Just make sure you keep any info you used. If something happens they ask for everything, name, number, email, etc. if you&#039;re trying to find out why your money hasn&#039;t shown up.

				I wouldnt worry about using yah real name w. bitinstant. Not hooked to your bank account and you can say your paying a bill. Most clerks wont know what zipzap is and will assume your paying off an electric bill. Gota blend in. Or if they do know just say your playing some poker. Either way they cant read your mind. And honestly I put my credentials. Figure if they do ask for info I look less shady having correct info rather then explaining why my id says one name but I wrote something else. <br /><br />Sure if they really wanted yah they can see yah in cameras and figure out the time you were at the cash place in Wal-Mart. Gota blend in.

				If you are planning to use a moneygram through CVS though, there is a chance that the clerk will ask you for an ID. I recently had this happen when trying to use an alias with bitinstant. <br /><br />I ended up walking away from the transaction and getting coins elsewhere.<br /><br />This was only at one CVS location though (even though she claimed it was a global policy). Other locations that I have been to have not asked for an ID to go along with the transaction.

				I&#039;ve had a clerk ask &quot;what&#039;s ZipZip&quot; i didn&#039;t know what to say for a moment. I just said it&#039;s a payment processor. I also noticed if the phone number doesn&#039;t match the name written on the MG slip, they ask questions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found other alternatives to using Bitinstant/MG.

				Try BST, they&#039;re more anonymous. Just use a throwaway email through tor. Then you just have to walk into a BofA with cash.<br /><br />Here is their site: http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm

				Use your real credentials and just stop being paranoid if you&#039;re a buyer. Tons of people use Bitcoins daily to pay for services now. I&#039;ve even seen grass/lawn cutting businesses accept it with a QR code stamped on the side of their truck for their Bitcoin address.<br />&nbsp;<br />Purchasing Bitcoins as of right now is NOT illegal in the United States. Why would you even worry about that?<br /><br />Also for those uninformed. There&#039;s a new beta version of BitInstant.
