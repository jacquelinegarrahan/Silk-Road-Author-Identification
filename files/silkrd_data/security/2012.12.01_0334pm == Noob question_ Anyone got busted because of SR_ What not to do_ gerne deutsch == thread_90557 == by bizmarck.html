				gerne deutsch = german is fine too<br /><br />Hello dear community,<br />sorry if this is something already discussed. I searched but couldn&#039;t find a similar thread.<br /><br />So, would anyone be so kind and share his or her experience with LE? I&#039;m especially interested in German police encounters, but anywhere else is fine too.<br />Let&#039;s say you don&#039;t have a background doing illegal things and never caught police attention. How likely is getting busted as a buyer (small amounts) because of SR only?<br />What not to do? Where not to put your stash in the house? Anyone ever got busted because he used his real bank account for buying coins? (buying btc anonymously are not as easy in germany as in the US). What to do when they do come knocking? etc.<br /><br />Please share your experience with us newbies, because the more secure we behave, the more secure is SR as a whole.<br /><br />Thanks and peace to all.

				I&#039;m a new member also and my information might not be true. :)<br /><br />I think that there are people who has got busted for purchasing illegal things from the market.It&#039;s an black market and people are selling illegal things in here and that&#039;s not left unnoticed by the police also. Sure there are some people who has got busted because of purchasing illegal things, but mostly it were their own fault i suppose.If you&#039;re not making silly mistakes yourself then you&#039;ll surely stay safe in the SR. I think that SR is the most secured blackmarket you can count on. Always check the forum before buying something and check the seller&#039;s profile for previous transactions.<br /><br />You&#039;re safe if you don&#039;t screw up yourself. That&#039;s an interesting thread you should read. :)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=post;topic=90557.0;last_msg=638102

				The german importers I know use packstations those rent a public po box circle things in the middle of the street and import only within the EU, they never have problems if the vendor is reliable with stealth<br /><br />Dealing with cops is just like any other &quot;western&quot; country, you say nothing, get a lawyer, and if they want you to come down and make a voluntary statement you go directly to a solicitors or lawyers office and have them draft up a statement saying you refuse to give the police a statement and hand deliver it with them :) I&#039;m sure there&#039;s free legal societies in Germany that can do this like every other country if you have no money<br /><br />
