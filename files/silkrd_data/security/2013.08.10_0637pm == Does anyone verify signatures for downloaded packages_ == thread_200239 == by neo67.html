				In the directory of the files within a DOS window:<br /><br />gpg --verify tor-browser-whatever.asc tor-browser-whatever.exe<br /><br />As long as you have the proper key installed (fingerprint 0x416F061063FEE659) then it should be verified as correct. Otherwise you may have downloaded a DEA rootkit&nbsp; :o

				Don&#039;t worry about what I said. It&#039;s highly unlikely.<br /><br />Just use the command gpg --verify with the name of the asc file followed by the name of the exe file. If you have the proper GPG key installed then it should verify no problem.
