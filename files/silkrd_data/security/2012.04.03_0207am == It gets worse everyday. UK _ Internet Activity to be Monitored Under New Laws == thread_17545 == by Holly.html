				Looks like you&#039;ll have to buy modified computer hardware if you plan on upgrading anything now. Implying under the circumstances this actually does get legislated. I&#039;m sure someone out there will figure out how to disable that GCHQ shit, not that I even know what element of hardware this will be installed on though.

				GCHQ is the UK version of NSA. They don&#039;t give a shit about anybody here either. <br /><br />Also NSA has already been illegally doing this in USA for at least the past 11 years , so I am forced to lol at the person who thinks UK has it so much worse than USA. USA signals intelligence agency has been doing this *illegally* (in UK they apparently made it legal first) years before the UK signals intelligence agency publicly started doing it. But in either case both have probably been doing it long before we were made aware of it. Intelligence agencies are quite frankly not bound by the laws that effect everyone else....why challenge the law Armtax it already says what NSA is doing is illegal....good luck getting them to stop doing it with yours citizens petition lol (also congress passed a statute saying that the cooperating telecommunications centers can not be held liable for assisting the NSA in breaking the law, even though it is widely agreed that&nbsp; they ARE breaking the law by assisting NSA in breaking the law) <br /><br />https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/no-checks-or-balances-warrantless-wiretapping-despite-holders-assurances<br />https://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">VPN or Tor would prevent them from seeing which sites you&#039;re visiting.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe. It looks like they want timing data too (same as NSA), not just standard IP data retention stuff. If they keep database of timing information for a large number of packets in UK, they will probably have pretty decent luck to deanonymize people even if they are using Tor or a VPN. They will become a passive adversary in the context that all UK Tor nodes will be essentially worthless for hiding from them, it would be as if they themselves owned every Tor node / VPN node / Proxy being monitored with this system (low latency can not protect at all from passive attackers linking in and out packets). For NSA having these abilities is enough for them to passively pwn Tor they essentially own every USA node since they can passively monitor traffic in and out, and a lot of nodes are in USA (and no you should not stop using nodes in USA! Let Tor pick your path as always!). Plus they can see all foreign traffic that is routed through exchanges. The GCHQ may not be in as ideal a location as NSA is, to gather as much damning signals, but when you are up against world leading signals intelligence agencies who are monitoring all traffic in their country, you are going to have a pretty hard time to keep yourself anonymous from them, especially if you live in their country and a substantial amount of nodes on the network you use relay traffic through their country / the website you visit is in their country. In all cases they would be able to link UK to UK communications even if the relays are in three random other countries, since seeing entry and exit is all it takes for timing data to link packets together. <br /><br />It is scary that they want to give police access to this information. In the USA it appears to only be in the hands of the NSA, although nothing is legally stopping the feds from doing passive monitoring of Tor relays in USA under CALEAs trap and trace / pen register provisions.
