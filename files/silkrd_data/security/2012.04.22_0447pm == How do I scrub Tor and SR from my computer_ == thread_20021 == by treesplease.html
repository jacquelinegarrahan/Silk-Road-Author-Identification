				I&#039;m now on TAILS, but I started logging onto SR via the Tor Browser in the beginning. <br />How do I remove Tors and SR from my computer short of wiping my HD?

				There is software that will &#039;wipe&#039; certain files by writing over them a number of times. I wouldn&#039;t put my full trust into this though, because if your computer has moved things around recently, which it may do when defragmenting or something like that, then that file may have been written to more than one place.<br /><br />When you delete a file, the operating system does not erase it from the drive, it just marks it as available space and hides it from you. So, if the files were moved around on you computer at all, it may be on your HD still, so the best thing is to do a DBAN wipe, as prawl said.

				I just deleted the tor browser folder and archive. I ran ccleaner. Defragged the hard drive, go back to ccleaner under tools you can wipe the free space only option. I used advanced overite (3 Passes ). Should be good enough. If your that paranoid just do the dban thing and spend all day reinstall OS and all other software......Have fun !&nbsp; &nbsp;You ever wonder how much other incriminating shit you may have on your computer?. I&#039;m sure alot of us here have illegally downloaded music or movies ? Your worries about a little folder called tor browser ?
