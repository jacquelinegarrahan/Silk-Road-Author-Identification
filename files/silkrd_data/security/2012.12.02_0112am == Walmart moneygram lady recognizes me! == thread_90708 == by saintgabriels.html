				Ah geez. So...I&#039;ve been to the moneygram center a handful of times at this one Walmart as it&#039;s the only one fairly close to my house without driving 30+ miles. While doing research on making deposits here on the forums I read to not use the same name/phone number/address/etc. as they track your info. Well....apparently the lady there recognized me today. When I handed her the form and I didn&#039;t come up in her computer, she said &quot;I know you&#039;re in here.&quot; I told her this one was for my roommate and she just plugged in the info and muttered something about the phone number being different.<br />So, fellow forum members...what are your suggestions for this situation?<br />Should I go back through the previous slips and use that info that she knows consistently? (None of the info is true or tied to me in any sort of way)<br />Should I start going to different locations and keep away from this particular walmart for a while?<br />Use a disguise? (I&#039;m one of those people that unfortunately has a unique look)<br />Keep using different information each time and let the ladies that work there be completely confused as to why they can&#039;t find me in their computers though they&#039;ve seen me before?<br />Any help is appreciated, thanks. :)<br /><br />EDIT: I added a poll because they&#039;re fun. You&#039;re welcome

				buying bitcoin isnt illegal. i dont see why people get so nervous when buying bitcoin. if your really paranoid dont have your coins sent directly to your SR wallet.<br /><br />mtgox wallet--------&gt;pc wallet----&gt;2nd pc wallet-----&gt; to SR wallet.<br /><br />even if SR were to &quot;Busted&quot; there is no way to tie you to any account if youre doing what you should be doing.

				I would switch to a different location if possible, I know in my area there is a few check cashing places that does the zipzap bill pay, you might want&nbsp; want to look into that.

Anyone selling one??<br /><br />@Hasselhoff, that&#039;s precisely why I&#039;m paranoid and cautious about this lady recognizing me. God (pegasus in the sky/whatever) forbid LE starts to really pay attention. Yes, there&#039;s nothing illegal (exactly) about buying bitcoins, but my thinking is what if there was a connection made? Real life example-what if I donated money to a company I thought was legit, and it turned out they were using my money to fund a crime. It doesn&#039;t matter whether I &quot;knew&quot; what was really going on, fact is that I funded that crime, therefore making me liable and a co-conspirator in a sense.<br /><br />@neimtel, do you know if the process at another check cashing place would have a similar process of depositing as walmart? Completely happy with a short answer to save some time researching and driving up there next time to find out it&#039;s an insane process.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies so far guys!

Do you realize how much time and money will be wasted trying to get someone on something that probably wont be big? I estimate that less than 30% of the actual buyers buy enough to raise attention for the feds to indict.<br /><br />just my theory

				I think you should just find a different WalMart. I&#039;ve been having a similar problem with the teller at the bank (I use Canadian Bitcoin) and the last time she even asked me what kind of business the payment was going to (the account name is rather obscure). I sort of just laughed and walked away.<br /><br />Better to be unnecessarily safe than sorry! :)

Hand them the zipzap slip and say &quot;I would like to pay&nbsp; bill.&quot; I have even had places that have signs that say &quot;ID required&quot; and they didn&#039;t ask, smaller businesses would be more likely to do that than major corporations.

				@Agria- I&#039;m glad to see that I&#039;m not the only experiencing this dilemma, though it sucks.<br /><br />@coolkid-True...Would you want to be the one that they make an example of on the off chance they decided to pursue you though? Getting comfortable and thinking they&#039;re not watching always leads to carelessness and eventually getting caught. Sounds like you have your shiz all under control and secure, so props :)<br /><br />@niemtel-thanks bro. wish I could +1 you for the inside info, &#039;preciate it<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90708.msg639811#msg639811">Quote from: msfish on December 02, 2012, 06:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I saw that obviously you must be getting bits via moneygram.&nbsp; Can you please tell me what to do?&nbsp; i&#039;m new and I would like to be able to purchase some stuff but i haven&#039;t been able to figure out how to send myself the bits. Thanks any help would be great.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s such a broad question. There is a plethora of information that can be found here on the forums and all over the internet. Use the search function and learn as much as you can before even considering making a purchase. Read the buyer&#039;s guide on SR if you haven&#039;t already. I&#039;m not trying to be rude, but it&#039;s actually (in my opinion) rude to post in the middle of someone&#039;s topic with a general question that can be figured out in a matter of minutes. I learned things by reading and researching. I suggest every newbie should do the same. Ask a specific questions that you can&#039;t find any info on, and I&#039;d be more than happy to help.
