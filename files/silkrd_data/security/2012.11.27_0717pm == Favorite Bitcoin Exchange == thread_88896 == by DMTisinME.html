				I have used bitinstant, bitfloor, and have most recently been using bitme. Bitfloor was the best as it was fastest and had no limits, it&#039;s too bad about it getting robbed. Bitme is ok, but it&#039;s mildly annoying that you don&#039;t just buy directly from them and have to exchange with other members at their prices, and the $500 max/week sucks, I have to have 3 accounts just to fill one order on here sometimes. <br /><br />So, what place do you use? What do you think&#039;s the best? <br /><br />I&#039;d like to have a cash deposit at a local bank w/out a maximum. Any vendors on here that are good? I&#039;ve never gone through anyone on SR.

				I&#039;ve heard good things about Sugar Mama, but other than having heard lots of good things from other people I have no opinion whatsoever myself.<br /><br />I generally use BitInstant to bitcoin address.&nbsp; Did BitInstant to MtGox one time during their lack of coin transfers to an arbitrary bitcoin address... but that&#039;s all.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t require verification if you don&#039;t access from Tor.&nbsp; BTC-e.com seems reputable and is sometimes almost 40-50 cents cheaper per coin, but I think people have run into trouble when they don&#039;t check the &quot;BitInstant reserve: &quot; amount on the lower right of the main page.&nbsp; If it&#039;s lower than your order, I think you&#039;re going to be waiting awhile for the deposit to go through.<br /><br />Again, never used them though.

				IMO, bitme is much better than bitinstant because of the fee&#039;s they charge. They both have a $500 max though. I might get a verified bitme account to remove the limit, but this seems way too revealing. Does anyone have a verified bitme account?

It works nearly identically to the way bitfloor used to. Super fast. Only downside is the $500 max, which means looking suspicious if you go through more than couple times... the guy at my local chase thinks I&#039;m a god damn bitcoin broker. Luckily chase&#039;s are everywhere.<br /><br />On another note, I have an exchange set up with sugar mama tomorrow and bitme. I&#039;ll update on how it goes with sugar mama, although i&#039;m sure it&#039;ll go perfectly fine.

				I&#039;d like to note that today I used Sugar mama by moneygram and got the coins within a few hours hour of sending the info. No fee&#039;s but the moneygram charge was 5.75% with a max deposit of $899.<br /><br />I also used bitme once again and got the coins within an hour of handing over the money. I paid .3 over the BTC rate because it&#039;s a publicly driven which cost me a smaller amount than the moneygram. <br /><br />Both were fairly painless in person, I didn&#039;t even have to write anything at chase for bitme this time, and at walmart for the moneygram I just used a fake name and address. Worked like a charm for both.<br /><br />I&#039;ll check out the two above as well.

				Bitmarket? I&#039;m with them and about to change. They have taken over 24hrs to send my BT&#039;s to my SR account.<br />Had a few members yesterday tell me not to use their service again, so i&#039;ve just signed up to MtGox...will see how they are, hopefully faster.
