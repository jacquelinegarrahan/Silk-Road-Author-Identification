				I made a cash deposit to bit instant, but it has been over six hours with no email and no btc. l I have used this method several times before without issue. I have confirmed that the payment was successful, but have been unable to contact bit instant.<br /><br />I been trying various bit instant contacts all day. First I emailed, but still no reply.&nbsp; I ran into a few others with the same problem in the unmanned bit instant 24/7&nbsp; irc support chat. Another person in the chat said they called the support line, but could not reach a human.<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problem? Whats going on?

				It literally just came through after I creating the thread. Over six hours to get funds... Did anyone else have this problem? I think they should refund their fee. We pay BI 4% extra for the speed and convenience, right?

				That&#039;s good,. Glad it is not widespread. <br /><br />I replied to the support email that finally came, and he told me tormail is &quot;unreliable,.&quot; He said they processed the btc, but that I didn&#039;t get the email..I would be interested to know if anyone else has failed to get email when using bit instant and tormail. I&#039;m inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, but that was the rationale for not refunding the commission.

				Thanks for the replies. I received another email from Charlie at bit instant. He was very nice and he is going to make everything right. I have used bit instant several times in the past, and have always been very happy with the service. Normally, it only takes about five minutes. Bottom line: They fixed the problem and stuck to their word, so I have no problem using them again in the future.
