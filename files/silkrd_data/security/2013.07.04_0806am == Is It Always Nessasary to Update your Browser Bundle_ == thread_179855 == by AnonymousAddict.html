				I was just wondering if everyone updates everytime we get the option to? <br /><br />Also When/If you do, <br /><br />Do you Delete the Older Version then download an run the newer version? I&#039;m guessing thats the only way, cause i just downloaded the New update&nbsp; 2.3 25.10 en from the last one, an i thought maybe it would work to just extract an let it run over the other one, but that didnt work. <br /><br />In the past Iv always Just completed removed the previous an installed the NEW. IS that how everyone does it?

				I already told you yes, if you want to remain secure.<br /><br />Always update TOR, TBB and TAILS.

				For security, it&#039;s best to only use full versions of Tor, unless you know what you&#039;re doing. No alpha. No beta.<br />Update to the new version when it is released, because beyond the occasional upgrade of content it always offers a small host of bug/security fixes.

It will integrate some functionality into Torbutton and lose other functionality. I don&#039;t think there will be a Network Map anymore, for example. You can play around with it, but keep in mind that it is experimental and probably buggy.<br />

				Hey, Astor. I heard that all the downtime we experienced recently was due to an inherent problem with Tor that DPR couldn&#039;t fix. Do you think the Tor problem that led to our recent SR problems will be fixed in the new version?

				I don&#039;t know what caused the downtime, but the site is up. If it was an inherent problem in Tor that DPR couldn&#039;t fix, wouldn&#039;t it still be down?<br />

				I&#039;ve noticed updating tor on the reg helps significantly to improve the speed of the browser. It used to be slow as balls now not so much.

You can edit Torrc file to do a lot of things like only using semi-trusted exit points that are run by torservers.net project, and choosing which kinds of relays and what countries. Failing that if Tor is really slow just click on &#039;Use a New Identity&#039; and stop Vidalia then restart it. <br /><br />If you are using Tails and for whatever reason you can&#039;t upgrade by re-downloading another huge .iso then go to torproject.org, get 32bit Linux version of Tor Browser Bundle and un-archive it to your desktop. Click &#039;start tor&#039; and good to go until you can update all of Tails again.
