				Just came across this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn&#039;t gonna cut it.&nbsp; A Tormail replacement that&#039;s any good, <br />&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#039;s reliable, that&#039;s censorship-resistant, that&#039;s hardened ...<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; that will require professionals to set it up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to imply that we are professionals, but we will soon run a<br />mail gateway for .onions.<br /><br />The idea is that you can email @xyz.onion.to, and the mail gateway will<br />forward the mail to @xyz.onion. The gateway will only accept PGP mails,<br />and I&#039;m thinking about enforcing TLS.<br /><br />For the other way round, xyz.onion will be able to register and receive<br />a passphrase. With the passphrase, xyz.onion will be able to relay/send<br />emails as @xyz.onion.to. The gateway will also rewrite outgoing<br />@xyz.onion to @xyz.onion.to.<br />Maybe we should use client certificates instead.<br /><br />Another open question is what we should do with headers. At the moment,<br />the configuration file (onion_anonymize_headers) explicitly removes<br />User-Agent, X-Enigmail, X-Mailer and X-Originating-IP, whitelists<br />((Resent-)?From|To|Cc|Date|Return-Path|Message-ID|Reply-To|Bcc), and<br />then throws away any other header. This is obviously not the final<br />configuration. If anyone wants to contribute, feel welcome.<br /><br />I hope that with the modified torsocks that has an option to only torify<br />.onion I can simply put it in front of postfix and be done. We&#039;ll see.<br /><br />I invite everyone to contribute to the postfix configuration, and,<br />eventually, to run more mail gateways.<br /><br />https://github.com/moba/tor2mail<br /><br />No documentation yet, but I will make it ready before we launch.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s a message to the tor-talk mailing list by the guy who runs Torservers, so he&#039;s not some clueless newb with pie in the sky goals that are abandoned half way through development (like Bitwasp). Someone still needs to run a hidden service email server, but that&#039;s the easier part. Interfacing with clearnet anonymously was the hard part that Tormail solved before.<br /><br />Interestingly, a Tor-only email server already exists: <br /><br />http://365u4txyqfy72nul.onion/mail/<br /><br />http://365u4txyqfy72nul.onion/wmail/notice.html<br /><br />So the pieces are in place, if this mail gateway could send messages to the TSZ mail server, we effectively have a Tormail replacement.<br /><br />What I really like is that they will scan and discard emails that are non PGP encrypted.<br />

Anyone with half a brain would PGP incriminating or otherwise revealing information, if the website verified that you knew how to use PGP like onion bank used to do before the FH massacre then I have a feeling that it would have good results while not forcing someone to encrypt to even users who they are having innocent conversations with.<br /><br />This sort of handholding is something that we don&#039;t need. If a user cares about their privacy they will learn PGP and use it. If they do not care about their privacy and just unconciously say, &quot;You know this whole privacy thing is a lot of work....I think i&#039;ll just take the jail time&quot; then let them. Social darwinism will unfortunately run it&#039;s course regardless of how much PGP they are forcefed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for this post astor. I was wondering why it seemed that tormail was the only .onion mail service, and this explains.<br /><br />Likewise, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard it before, but thanks for all the great posts you put up here on the SR forum. Your posts have been nothing short of a treasure trove of great information.

				@Psyche<br />Maybe this is less about forcing users to use PGP but more about preventing the FBI/NSA harrassing him. If he can&#039;t decrypt the emails there is no point in targeting him.
