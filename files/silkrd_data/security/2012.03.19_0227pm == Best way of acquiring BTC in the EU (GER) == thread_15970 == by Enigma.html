				Hi,<br /><br />there are probably as many threads on how to get BTC as there are BTC but there are also as many opinions as there are answers.<br /><br />I have previously exchanged Ukash and Paysafecard vouchers for bitcoins but when dealing in the high hundreds of EUR the loss amounts.<br />I have looked into Intersango but again the price for BTC is usually 20 cent higher than the market price.<br /><br />Where can I get bitcoins closest to the market price in the EU, particularily Germany?<br /><br />I have considered using drcashancarry after reading some positive feedback but today I learned that international cash transfers are prohibited since 2007.<br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance!! :)

				The problem is that there is no fixed market price, they trade at different rates on different exchanges.<br />I have used Intersango myself many times and been impressed with the service.<br />

				What I meant by &quot;market price&quot; is the price they offer at MtGox, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m tired of paying the 10-25% commission. If I pay €800 it mean I only get BTC worth €600 - €720.<br /><br />Is it safe to get BTC from &quot;official&quot; sites like MtGox, etc? If I tumble them through some instawallets before sending them to my SR wallet? Or is there a way to not loose money using prepaid voucher like payafecards or ukash?

The only real drawback is the amount of time that it takes.&nbsp; You can also specify that it take longer (which is supposed to be even more secure).
