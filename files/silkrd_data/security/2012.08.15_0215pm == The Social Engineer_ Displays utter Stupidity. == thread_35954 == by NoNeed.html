				I&#039;ll be the first to admit I&#039;m not The Social Engineer&#039;s biggest fan, due to the undeniable similarities between this person and Zeus, but &lt;del&gt;so far they&#039;ve conducted themselves well on Silk Road.&lt;/del&gt; oops - turned out they&#039;ve been banned! (Thanks Lim!)<br />Despite my personal feelings towards them, how does what they&#039;re doing put them, us, or SR at risk in any way whatsoever?! They (or possibly someone saying it&#039;s them) put a report on pillreports with a link to their SR account. I fail to see how there&#039;s any risk in that at all, or the &#039;stupidity&#039; you attribute to them.<br /><br />EDIT: My argument still stands though, putting a link to their (now suspended) SR vendor profile on pillreports.com doesn&#039;t put anyone here at risk.

				IMO, kmfkewm is right. SR is probably not in any danger but none-the-less this is a really stupid move on his part. That is, although, where greed will take you. I personally have never bought from Social Engineer and I&#039;m new to these forums, so I can&#039;t say too much on his/hers personality or attitude but again -- this seems something motivated by greed, and it may be out of IRL necessity. <br /><br />Still, I&#039;m sure the owners of our great Road frown upon this.

The Silk Road is more than just a place to buy drugs; it represents freedom in the face of government tyranny. The more people that fight that tyranny - and fight it safely until there comes a time when we can throw off our cloaks of anonymity and fight our oppressors face to face, word for word, and supported by our peers - the better off we&#039;ll all be.

				I think the dumbest thing about this is that he posted a report on Pillreports with absolutely no information.<br /><br />No marquis results, only some bullshit second hand information. <br /><br />The guys an idiot and i don&#039;t regret his passing.

Outrageous behaviour, that. And I don&#039;t think anybody who even hints at doing that kind of thing is above doing it in future, regardless of lessons given.

No excuse for compromising any individual in this community, or threatening to!<br /><br />I still maintain it&#039;s Zeus though! :P

				Lol it is quite clearly Zeus. And no I have the power to ban people as-and-when the need arises but when I do ban someone I get to right them a personal message that they will see when they log in and I write a little note for the other Admin and DPR to see why I did it so they know the circumstances. I try to get quite creative with the messages the banned member sees but the notes why I banned have to be straight forward and concise. :)
