				Operation Pangea is over tomorrow.<br />Are we safe?<br />All these operations going on and shit I was wondering how can i best make myself safe against being caught?<br />I&#039;m about to learn PGP so i can stop plainly writing my address.<br /><br />I would like some things clarified <br /><br />1. Should I or should I not write my real name for the vendor to put on the package?<br />(I know not to sign for anything, but will this stop me from getting caught no matter what?)<br />2. Is just starting the Tor browser enough to keep me safe, or is there better ways to hide my identity?<br />3. I know your not supposed to open PDF files while connected to Tor, is there anything else i should avoid doing while using the tor browser?<br />4. I would like some more information on how to be safe and things to avoid.<br /><br />I know i can find these easily around the forums. But i want to hear everything everybody that replies to this thread have to say.

				I&#039;ve only been here a few days, but I think I can answer some of your questions. I highly recommend going back several pages on the Security subforum and reading through as many threads as you can.<br /><br />1. From what I&#039;ve read, you have a better chance at receiving your package when using your real name and address. You don&#039;t have much of a defense if you&#039;re caught picking up drugs from a PO box or someone else&#039;s house. I&#039;ve also read to write &quot;Return to sender&quot; in big letters on the package and letting it sit in your house for a day or two before opening it. However, I&#039;m sure LE knows about that trick.<br /><br />2. You can put Liberte Linux or Tails OS on a USB or MicroSD and boot your computer from there. I believe both of them store data in RAM, so nothing incriminating is left behind when you shut your computer down. A good tutorial I used was: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br />However, if you&#039;re just buying personal amounts, using Liberte or Tails isn&#039;t necessary, but you can never be too careful. I would recommend encrypting your hard drive with TrueCrypt.<br /><br />3. I&#039;d like to know the answer to this, as well.<br /><br />4. As far as I know, the most important thing is buying your bitcoins anonymously (I found Shroomeister&#039;s method to be the easiest: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0) and learning to use PGP/GPG.<br /><br />Again, and I can&#039;t stress this enough, I&#039;m new as well, so take my suggestions with a grain of salt.

				If you read through Pine&#039;s tutorial, the link listed below, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find the answer you seek for Question 3.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39320.15&nbsp; &nbsp; :)
