				I read in an article years ago (it was probably 10 years ago) in High Times which stated only 8-10 dogs had been trained to smell out MDMA.&nbsp; This was a reference to drug smelling dogs working in airports only.&nbsp; At that time only 10 dogs world wide employed as airport drug sniffers were trained to smell out MDMA... Do you guys see where I&#039;m going with this? <br /><br />Are all LE drug sniffing dogs trained to smell MDMA or are they going to alert to it anyway because it smells like an amphetamine?<br /><br />-Bill Paxton

				Yes they are. Use moisture barrier bags and you will be OK if you follow the directions. There is a sticky in the shipping section that will help here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0;topicseen

				Nah!??&nbsp; truly?&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought they were there just to check out people with bad BO so LE can get them to have a shower! <br /><br />Or, sometimes they&#039;re used&nbsp; as &quot;market researchers&quot; to ascertain which women are wearing the product being researched ...that said, we have heard they can also smell drugs also sometimes :o) . . .
