				Hi,<br /><br />if somebody is able to buy BTC in cash, which are transferred from his client (every account is only used once) directly to SR: is there any chance to be traced back?<br /><br />Is there any advice, that has to be taken care of, or are there any additional tumbling-methods, which are necessary, even if you bought your BTC in cash?<br /><br />(I know about the dangers of shipping, my questing is just about the payment.) <br /><br />Thx

				As long as the person you bought them for isn&#039;t LE, and does not know anything about you, I&#039;d say it is as safe as it can get. <br /><br />If the bitcoin project expands and gets a million active users, person to person exchanges will be much easier and the most anonymous way (again, as long as the person you sold them to isnt LE or knows you and might rat you out!).

				My recommendations would be:<br />1. Be careful not to leave fingerprints on the envelope or money if you&#039;ve ever been fingerprinted.<br />2. Use a return address of some worthy charity in your area.<br /><br />Also, if sending by regular post in a standard (10x24cm) personal-use envelope:<br />3. Don&#039;t send very many bills in the same envelope -- use larger denominations instead.<br />4. Pack the bills amid a few sheets of folded, unmarked paper -- again, watching the fingerprints if appropriate.<br />5. Take care not to lick the envelope or postage if your DNA has ever been sampled.<br />6. Hope that everyone using that exchanger has observed #3 and #4 -- or that the letter carrier is scrupulously honest.

				As long as the seller does not have any identifying information about you and the letter with the cash in it cannot be tied to you then yes this is safe. Also of course make sure that whatever account the seller will be transferring your coins to cannot be tied to you.<br /><br />Good luck.

If someone is using the usual bitcoin-client and is using an new account for each transfer: is there any chance to be traced back?
