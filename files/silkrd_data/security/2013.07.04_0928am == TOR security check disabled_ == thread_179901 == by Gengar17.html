				&nbsp;I started up TOR tonight and the home page says, <br /><br />&quot;Sorry, check is temporarily disabled until we can fix it. (If you&#039;re reading this with Tor Browser Bundle, your Tor is working fine.)&quot;<br /><br />Tried looking it up on clearnet, found nothing... Is this something I should be worried about?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				I also recieved this message now, I thought that it was a backdoor being created to see what websites i accessed but now that i am seeing other people saying the same thing, (this is after i searched to see if the message was widespread which it appeared to be, hence why im on here now) I reckon the problem actually is with tor. I use tails so everything gets routed through tor anyway. <br /><br />Wonder how safe it is, or if LE might have cracked a tor node properly.. Because it also says &quot;A temporary service outage prevents us from determining if your source IP address is a Tor node.&quot;&nbsp; <br />It does say your ip adress appears to be &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot; however i know that the one shown is not my own ip so im not sure whats going on.

				Woke up this morning and everything seems normal again... Still, it&#039;s weird there was no mention of the outtage from TOR.

				Well, there was the giant warning message on check.torproject.org itself. All that happened was that their mechanism for downloading the exit node list failed so they couldn&#039;t compare your IP address to the list to confirm your TBB was working, even though it would be working for 99.99% of users. As usual, the paranoid darknets went ape shit.<br />
