				You can either get a powerful one for gaming and use tails/whonix/liberte/whatever (play with VM?) to browse the onion world... or get two machines, a gaming one and a cheap/second hand one for your &#039;privacy related&#039; activities, that would be used only for that, running something like tails, no HDD and connecting to the interwebs only from public wifi...<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you, depends what you plan to do and what are your priorities... <br /><br />

				Any laptop can be made more secure, but if you want to run a Linux-based solution like Tails or Liberte, the higher end ones will tend to have less compatible hardware, like UEFI (well, that&#039;s most laptops these day), wireless and graphics cards that require proprietary and/or Windows drivers and so on.<br /><br />If you want to run a Linux-based solution, Lenovo laptops tend to work really well out of the box.<br /><br />Also, I believe eddiethegun is selling a preconfigured laptop on SR.<br />

				I have been using a cheap netbook for &#039;work&#039; here on the road, something I can run encrypted and happily toss.&nbsp; It is more then sufficient for my needs.

This idea seems pretty solid to me (though I&#039;m far from the most tech savvy around here). I would be VERY careful when using anything prefigured by someone else. Much better to learn the basics ourselves and build our own knowledge - &#039;teach a man to fish ...&#039; you get the idea. If we don&#039;t understand the inner workings of any applciation we use then we are ripe for exploitation. The strength of this community is we don&#039;t know who anyone is. Anything pre-configured could be provided by the members of LE providing them with a cloaked backdoor into your life.

				Maybe also get a harddrive that supports hardware disk encryption (my next project) , as well as software disk encryption through truecrypt/LUKS/whatever you use. Install key scrambler, noscript, https everywhere, ghostery, T.A.C.O. browser add ons to your browsers. then buy a VPN service with bitcoin :) i really like torguard and BTguard. that way any data stored in your computer is encrypted, and all traffic sent to and fro through your vpn is encrypted as well, and keyscrambler fights key loggers in between. However a sophisticated attacker can find a way around key scrambler, but it still is a great tool to fight off hobby-hackers with key loggers

Your anonymity depends on the software you run on it. The specific hardware is irrelevant, except to the extent that it works with your software.

It&#039;s very easy to set up and offers a great deal of security. Version 0.19 has just been released, try following the instructions found in the post entitled &#039;Installing TAILS Persistent Version&#039; or something like that on the first page of the Security page. It&#039;s an excellent guide - note the requirement for two USBs. <br /><br />With TAILS you are essentially ruuning your computer from the USB and everything exiting your computer moving onto the internet is forced through Tor. Very cool.<br /><br />pb.
