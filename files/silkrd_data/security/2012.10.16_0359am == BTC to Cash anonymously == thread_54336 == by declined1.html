				I am someone to just got into BTC and I like it. This is all. <br /><br />A transaction in person is NOT more anonymous than mail. Giving BTC is not illegal. Giving cash is not illegal. Giving cash by mail for BTC should not be illegal.

As is moving it from your SR wallet to another wallet, then selling them locally. You need to launder your Bitcoin properly. A forum search will throw up some pointers on doing this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=54336.msg525731#msg525731">Quote from: ETFA1235 on October 16, 2012, 04:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you need cash for BTC ? If so PM me. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ETFA12345, it is entirely against the forum rules to sell or exchange on the forum, or to advertise without a vendor account. Please refrain from doing so or your actions will be reported to the administrators.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
