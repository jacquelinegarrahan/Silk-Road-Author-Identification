				So far I&#039;ve just been pasting the PGP message into enigmail and emailing it to myself to open it up. <br /><br />But with multiple VMs running, and email in a different VM, cutting and pasting isn&#039;t possible, so how do most vendors here decrypt their orders that are written in PGP?

				Good question.&nbsp; The solution I settled on is firegpg with firefox 3.&nbsp; Chrome has a plugin, but I couldn&#039;t get it to work.<br />You can set firefox 3 up with vidalia and the tor button, so you load your order page from SR, then you have to save it as an html file, then you load the html file, and click each PGP message for instant decryption.&nbsp; Please re[ply when someone find a more eloquent solution.&nbsp; Like a front end that decrypted the oredr page, and exported into a access database, for the label printing.

				It sounds like you&#039;ve got an equally cumbersome work-around.<br /><br />I&#039;ve finally got Liberte Linux running in perfect isolation, only to find out I can&#039;t cut and paste encrypted PMs and move them to where Thunderbird lives : (

				I looked into cryptophane, but that&#039;s a windows-based program and it looks like the last update was back in 2009. Is there a similar program for linux?

				FireGPG is not safe nobody uses it anymore.<br />Command line cut+paste works fine, or make a file, call it msg.asc and paste it full of encrypted info. use gpg to decrypt<br />

				How about just copy+paste to GPG&#039;s clipboard and then click decrypt?<br /><br />So I just have my browser open and GPG - GNU Privacy Assistant

				Not a vendor so possibly off-topic but I kinda like http://ppgp.sf.net/.<br />Runs on Win and Linux (Java app), is self contained so you can run it from an encrypted thumb drive, vm, ...<br />A little rudimentary maybe but it gets the job done.

				I agree Firegpg is probably not safe if you are using firefox 3.01 to browse behind tor.&nbsp; And I see no problem just using it to load my orders from a html&nbsp; file.&nbsp; When you have 20 orders, it sure is nice to just see 20 addresses.

				Is it different for vendors? I just copy &amp; paste into the clipboard, click decrypt, enter a password, and voila. I suck with computers, and it takes about 4 seconds to click all that :) I get encrypted messages in SR PM from my vendors...that&#039;s why I ask...is it different for vendors?

				snapple there is a clipboard feature SuperDimitri is referring to with GPA, it may run on liberte but you will need to find and rpm or otherwise suitable package to install it with. I believe liberte is built based on debian so you may be able to find a debian package that will install on it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Looker

				SuperDimitri<br /><br />I was thinking it had gpg but not gpa but in a default config your right it should be under the system tools menu.<br />

				That was it: in Liberte Linux it&#039;s gpa under system tools. <br /><br />Just imported by keys and it works like a charm. You guys are awesome!

				Well I would copy the text and paste into MS Word, then save as an .asc file (had to dl a patch from the net to do this), then open Kleopatra and click decrypt-&gt;whatever the file is.&nbsp; I like the Gnu4Win that has the Kleopatra interface, not sure if they all do.&nbsp; Actually the hardest part was figuring out how to save the encrypted message as an .asc file, I&#039;m not sure I could do it again even.&nbsp; Had to move it into a certain folder and play with it a while. :P
