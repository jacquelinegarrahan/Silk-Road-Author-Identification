				Hello<br /><br />i have been wondering now for the last few days about a package i had sent to me via a letter that contained a few grams of hash and i got busted, eighter that or the postman snatched it..<br />Anyways to make a long story short i meet a guy online and he agreed to send me a few grams of hash for free and wollah, i recived it.. and it was oh so good, real kashmir hash but when i had smoked it all i emailed him and asked if he could send some more and sure enough he could and i transferred him some money and he sent it, i just wanna trow it out there that this man is not on SR i met him actually on chatroulette (i know what your thinking) hehe.. <br />But whatever, then some days later i watched the post truck pulled up by my house and he put an envolope Envelope in my mail box and when he left i went out and grabbed it and what i saw was not pleasent, it had been very snuggly been cut open on one side and and no content inside besides an&nbsp; card that said &quot;Have a nice day&quot;.. i was last friday and i have nothing heard from the police or anything..<br />but i was planning on ordering like 100-200grams on here in a month and was wondering if it would be stupid of me, or if i should wait longer before i do anything again..?<br />Since i have not heard anything yet from no one, i thought i would be maby they are keeping an eye on my name now and checking extra well, i mean like we are talking about 6-7grams no big deal id say, but there may be a possibility?.<br />i live in a small contrry with a small population of people.. less than 1000.000, also the costums here sometimes are not even having dogs there to detect illegal substances that may some, and their work place is currently under construction so now they only have a very small room to work in so i guess i can call it that it very much a gamble but i am affraid that they may pull my mail from the bunch and wait before prosessing it to delivery for the dog to detect later on when its there?..<br /><br />what do you guys think about it?..<br />was thinking ordering upon Christmas becaus tons and tons of packages arrive in december and this may just slip by and i may get lucky or are they smarter than that?..<br /><br />Anyways, thanks!<br />-Skyhigh420.<br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />
