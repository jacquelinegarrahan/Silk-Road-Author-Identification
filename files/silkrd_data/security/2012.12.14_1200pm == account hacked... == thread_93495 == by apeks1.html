				My account has just been compromised! no idea how but I logged in and silk road detected multiple login attempts so I entered my pin. My SR bitcoin wallet has been emptied of aprox 3 coins and the attacker managed to change my password before I could, so I can&#039;t login now either! This especially concerns me as I have incomplete transactions that are still yet to be finalised etc. <br />How do I go about getting my account back? Is there a contact email I could use for silk road and how quick are they to respond.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />apeks

Though it may be little consolation, you&#039;re not the first. The site at the link you went to is a scam site set up to harvest users login details.<br />Register a new account and contact SR Support letting them know that you logged in using an incorrect link, and your password etc. was changed. Give them your account history: your last 3 purchases (who they were with and the approximate amounts and dates of these transactions), and your password history.<br />They may be able to help you out.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				And yet you enjoy the fruits of their labor by buying the chems they cook up (no judgements, naturally -- I do it too just like all of us here).&nbsp; Well, I personally have no problem with someone who thinks computers are just plain boring and only cares about learning enough to actually use Silk Road with moderate safety (all things considered, obviously ordering drugs is... you know what I&#039;m saying).<br /><br />There isn&#039;t exactly a one-stop-tutorial that explains precisely what you need to know and precisely as much of it as you need.&nbsp; That&#039;s the sort of thing people are very good at that computers are very bad at -- summarizing information, analyzing context and being able to see where someone might misunderstand something, etc.. As long as someone&#039;s polite and grateful, I don&#039;t have any issues spending my time helping somebody who only wants to know this stuff to order drugs.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t think they represent a necessary danger to themselves or anyone else, provided they&#039;re willing to learn when others are willing to teach.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you, but I learned by reading what others had written.&nbsp; If they had said &quot;fuck that, this shit isn&#039;t for people who don&#039;t design CPUs, they can piss off!&quot; I wouldn&#039;t have ever figured out how to do more with a computer than boot the thing.&nbsp; See what I&#039;m getting at.
