				Hey guys,<br /><br />I have come so far and it&#039;s killing me!... I want Ubuntu to connect to Tor only through a firewall (using a Oracle VM) after setting up and then doing the following as instructed (in short) -<br /><br />1.Start TorBrowser Bundle.<br />2. Click &quot;Firewall&quot; to highlight it, and then click on &quot;Snapshots (1)&quot; in the top right.<br />3. Right click on &quot;Snapshot 1&quot; and then select &quot;Restore Snapshot&quot;. Select &quot;Restore&quot; if prompted.<br />4. Right click &quot;Firewall&quot; and click &quot;Start&quot;<br />5. Right click &quot;Primary&quot; and click Start. Log in as normal.<br />6. Go to &quot;Applications&quot; -&gt; &quot;Accessories&quot; -&gt; &quot;Terminal&quot;<br />7. Type in: sudo bash&nbsp; &nbsp; (and hit enter)<br />8. Type in the following commands exactly as shown below (or copy paste them):<br /><br />ifconfig eth0 10.0.3.2<br /><br />9. Your terminal window should still be open. Type in the following command exactly as shown (or copy paste it):<br /><br />ssh -N -L 9050:10.0.2.2:9050 root@10.0.3.1<br /><br />10. Type &quot;yes&quot; if prompted. When prompted for the password, give your Firewall password. Not your Ubuntu password.<br />11. In your terminal window, go to &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Open Tab&quot;.<br />12. Now, type exactly as shown below to open the second tunnel:<br /><br />ssh -N -L 8118:10.0.2.2:8118 root@10.0.3.1<br /><br />13. Return to Firefox. Go to the &quot;File&quot; menu and uncheck &quot;Work Offline&quot; if it is checked.<br />14. Go to the URL: http://check.torproject.org<br /><br />I then get the following error while trying to go to the above URL in Firefox<br /><br /><br />The connection was reset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; moments.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer&#039;s network<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connection.<br />&nbsp; If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.<br /><br />And in my terminal i get -<br />channel 2: open failed: connect failed: Connection timed out<br />channel 3: open failed: connect failed: Connection timed out<br /><br />Can someone help an IT illiterate?<br /><br />Thanks

				not quite sure what you are aiming for but if you want Ubuntu in the oracle VM to only be able to send through Tor, do the following:<br /><br />Step One: In the virtualbox networking section of your VM, select &#039;host only&#039;<br /><br />Step Two: In the virtualbox manager, go to file -&gt; preferences -&gt; network -&gt; [virtual adapter #] and click on the edit icon. It will show you the internal IP address of the virtual adapter, which is probably 192.168.56.1<br /><br />Step Three: In your Torrc file, uncomment the line #SocksListenAddress 192.168.0.1:9100 and replace 192.168.0.1 with the internal IP address of your virtual adapter...192.168.56.1:9100 most likely is what you want<br /><br />Step Four: In the VM go to System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network Proxy. Select &#039;Manual proxy configuration&#039; and go down to Socks host. Enter your virtual adapters internal IP address (192.168.56.1 most likely) in the address box and 9100 in the port box. Click &#039;Apply System-wide&#039; and enter your root password when it asks. Click close after you have done this.<br /><br />From there you can configure Firefox to use Tor as normal, Tor should be listening on 127.0.0.1:9100<br /><br />It seems like this is probably not what you want though. Please restate your goal in a more clear manner. I don&#039;t follow why you are restoring VM snapshots, where you are clicking Firewall or Primary, where those internal IP addresses are coming from, why you are sshing to Tor and then to privoxy which you shouldn&#039;t even be using anyway, or pretty much anything that you are saying including exactly wtf you are trying to do. are you behind a restrictive firewall and need to get around it with Tor?

				Would it not be easier just to configure your firewall?
