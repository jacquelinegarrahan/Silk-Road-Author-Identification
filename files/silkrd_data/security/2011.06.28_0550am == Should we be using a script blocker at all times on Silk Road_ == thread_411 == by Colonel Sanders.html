				In the unlikely event that Silk Road gets seized and kept online as a honeypot...&nbsp; And the feds embed some script or executable that sends our IPs back to them...<br /><br />Should we all be using a script blocker like NoScript for Firefox or something just in case?<br /><br />Gonna let those of you who know more about this shit than me advise.

				&gt; Should we all be using a script blocker like NoScript for Firefox or something just in case?<br /><br />Yes.&nbsp; It&#039;s safest to leave javascript DISabled -- in .onion-space or clearnet -- whenever possible.&nbsp; Flash, too.<br /><br />ip-check.info will show you what&#039;s enabled/disabled in your browser.

				&gt;Lol. You don&#039;t seem to understand how Tor works. But yes, you should use noscript to prevent against certain types of attacks that could compromise your computer.<br /><br />Well, I appreciate the hell out of the condescension, g4bb3r, but maybe you could explain why I&#039;m wrong then or where I&#039;m misunderstanding Tor?<br /><br />Because from what I understand, even on an .onion site, there are certain executable exploits (like Flash or even Javascript) that can be embedded in a webpage and harvest your real IP address and pass it along to somewhere else.<br /><br />If I&#039;m mistaken about that and it&#039;s completely impossible for the Feds to do such a thing if they were to gain control of Silk Road, please feel free to explain how and why instead of being unhelpful.

				Yes, I recommend the NoScript firefox plugin.<br /><br />I&#039;m using the bundled Torbrowser, which has all the plugins pre-installed and settings configured for the best possible anonymity.&nbsp; It&#039;s great, and easy to use!&nbsp; Now I use it for all of my secure browsing, which also keeps everything separate between my clean browser and my, ahem, not so clean browser.<br /><br />To test and see if there&#039;s any info your browser might be leaking, try this tool by the EFF that highlights browser fingerprinting:<br />https://panopticlick.eff.org/

				&gt; ...try this tool by the EFF that highlights browser fingerprinting: https://panopticlick.eff.org/<br /><br />That&#039;s another good site to know and use.&nbsp; Brought my fingerprint down from 1-in-100,000 to 1-in-50.&nbsp; (Got some more work to do, too.)

				No problem, g4bb3r.&nbsp; It *is* a sort of counterintuitive concept.<br /><br />(Confession: I was actually ok with 1-in-100,000 until I remembered there&#039;s only an estimated 300,000 or so Tor users worldwide.&nbsp; &lt;gulp!&gt;)
