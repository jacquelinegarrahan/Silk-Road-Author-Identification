				So, I think everyone here starts out coming to silk road and poking around long before they have a good, or even basic, idea of what their security is supposed to look like.<br /><br />How do we deal with our prior visits to silk road when we were running Tor bare out of windows 7 or some shit like that? surely we&#039;ve already been pegged as having visited the site, and I don&#039;t think LE&#039;s memory is so short that it will forget our addresses once the time comes to order.<br /><br />Is there any way to scrub ourselves clean? or keep ourselves &quot;clean enough&quot; in the future? I am poking through the general security setup now... for people like me this is really complicated stuff, and even after implementation i&#039;m still not too sure what the hell is going on lol.

				Eh, the very most LE knows is that you used TOR network. If that.<br /><br />That is it. They certainly don&#039;t know what hidden service you visited.

				I wouldn&#039;t be concerned about your ip address being logged. Like pine said, the most your ISP, probably, knows is that you connected to the TOR network. I&#039;d say the biggest thing is browser vulnerabilities, like super cookies and some of the about:config options. From BetterPrivacy extension:<br /><br />Some Flash-cookie (LSO) properties in short...<br />- they are never expiring - staying on your computer for an unlimited time.<br />- by default they offer a storage of 100 KB (compare: Usual cookies 4 KB).<br />- browsers are not fully aware of LSO&#039;s, They often cannot be displayed or managed by browsers.<br />- via Flash they can access and store highly specific personal and technical information (system, user name, files,...).<br />- ability to send the stored information to the appropriate server, without user&#039;s permission.<br />- Flash applications do not need to be visible<br />- there is no easy way to tell which Flash-cookie sites are tracking you.<br />- shared folders allow cross-browser tracking, LSO&#039;s work in every flash-enabled application<br />- the Flash company doesn&#039;t provide a user-friendly way to manage LSO&#039;s, In fact it&#039;s incredible cumbersome.<br />- many domains and tracking companies make extensive use of Flash-cookies.<br />This kind of cookies is not harmless.<br /><br />The scariest thing about flash cookies is that one is generally used as an ID cookie, which then immediately downloads all previous regular cookies. There is no way to &quot;scrub&quot; yourself clean. Indicative data was produced, but it may not have been collected. As long as you ran the tor-browser-bundle, you have reasonable protection; just Vidalia, worst off, just TOR script, even worse.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!&quot;

If you want to use a bridge, go to https://bridges.torproject.org/ and pick one of the volunteer bridges that runs on port 443. I would not use more than three bridges personally. Deep packet inspection will reveal that you&#039;re using Tor though, obfsproxy attempts to defend against this by transforming the traffic into something that looks innocent. I think these membership concealment measures are really cool and vendors especially should be using them.
