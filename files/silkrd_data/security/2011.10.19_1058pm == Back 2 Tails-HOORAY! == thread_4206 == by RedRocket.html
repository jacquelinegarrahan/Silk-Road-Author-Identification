				and it feels good :)<br /><br />i was using liberte for a week, and i glorified it on here,but now iam back to tails. after doing extensive research i am happy with my decision.<br /><br />liberte is just not meant for me, iam a hardcore user of tor and thats NOT what liberte was disigned for. liberte was disigned for two or more people all using the same distro to commincate stealthily between each other,as stipulated on his website. anything other than that he himself recommends using tails.<br /><br />besides that fact, i found that the madori web browser was crashing alot and freezing, there was also no tor gui. which made me uncomfortable.<br /><br />the thing i like about tails, is the fact that there is a group of people involved with its development and they are on the ball constantly,they are backed by a huge community and bugs are getting fixed all the time and improvements are always on going...they have source code auditors(and have had there source code audited).... they have a big forum with very intellegent people asking questions and tails answering them... with liberte and other distros i dont know what the fuck is going on...for all i know they could be twiddling there thumbs...i like to know that things are being done ,updates are being made etc,and tails is the only distro where i can see with my own eyes that its happening...<br /><br />what i will be doing next, is looking into the possibility of creating a multi-boot usb.where i can have two or more distros on one usb(or microsd)...the two distos that i want on my microSD card is tails and ubuntu..<br /><br />the reason i say ubuntu is that it has skype(really important to me),regular unsafe internet browser,and i will probably be able to watch youtube videos as well...so when im a good lil boy i will have a good time switching to ubuntu...when im bad i can switch to tails<br /><br />and being able to do all this all from one little microSD would be fantastic...you see,i currently dont have a hard drive in my computer,i destroyed it when i got paranoid.but i dont regret it, infact im glad i did, cause i can do pretty much what i want to from a microsd except skype,youtube etc...so to be able to do everything from a microsd would be wonderful..and i can just swallow it if shit hits the fan....<br /><br />

				I like to check distrowatch.com for the ever-changing list of top 100 Linux distros. I didn&#039;t see anything about Liberte (damn, how do you type that little Frenche e-with-accent?) Linux. Is it Debian-based? Is Tails?

				didnt know ubuntu was on top.....but those are not &quot;security orientated&quot; distros though that are on top...so doubt we will ever see tails/liberte/privatix etc etc on top

				I rotate between libertelinux, tails, and privatix...and just plain using the tor setup from a flash drive, which to me works best, and is least protective.&nbsp; The nice thing about tails, is also it&#039;s irritant: there is no persistence...no matter how you set it up, it will all erase when you are done...and for, when I&#039;m wandering around, especially when ordering, I like that: go to library or some other computer, use that.&nbsp; I keep an html file with all my passwords and shit online stashed, as they say,&#039; in dah claud, bra....&#039;<br /><br />Liberte I like, because it does have persistence, so when I get it set up nice, it saves the changes I&quot;ve made, bookmarks and such, in an enrypted folder....for that reason alone it is so handy...&nbsp; I&#039;ve had trouble getting it to run on linux distro, specifically Debian, but so far, I&#039;ve been doing a lot of my own loading, using their instructions, and I haven&#039;t wanted to use unetbootin, or some other &#039;wrapper&#039; which might make it boot.&nbsp; It does work great on my windows machine tho...<br /><br />And finally, gotta thro in a plug for privatix, everything in tor, kind of like liberte, and *everything* is encrypted...all persistent, and it&#039;s browser is good old iceweasel, rather than the liberte browser, which I bitch a lot about...<br /><br />Unfortunately, neither liberte nor privatix has enough english instructions, and neither seem very well known on the linux forums I&#039;ve been on...<br /><br />A lot depends on just how hard you think they&#039;re prone to following you, how ignorant you deem LE, and how much trouble you want to go to.&nbsp; Try to keep everything you can on an encrypted flash drive, however you go about your business...and some on here, who I respect, just run a dedicated linux virtual machine on whatever box they are on, and run the browser thru there, into tor on their main box...all kinds of ways to protect yourself...all in all, I kind of like tails myself tho, and they are out front, and in english, about everything that&#039;s goin on...and if you keep a good html folder w/passwords and maybe onion websites online, you should be good...or immediately install keepassx, and use their file endings, then keep a file in cloud or on flash drive...fun stuff...

				Easier is not always better.&nbsp; &quot;...tails is the only distro advertised on the tor website...so that must say something.&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, it says the Tails people work with the Tor people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Look over the Liberte Linux site carefully, click on many of the links the developer, Maxim Kammerer, has listed.&nbsp; He references many of the known security flaws of Tails, and if you&#039;re concerned with staying as anonymous as you can on the Internet you want a product developed by someone who recognizes the anonymity problems with both Tails and the standard Tor browser bundle.&nbsp; <br /><br />Read the bottom part of the page at http://dee.su/liberte -- the section marked Privacy-Enhancing Live Distribution.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about how Liberte addresses many of the security flaws in Tails.&nbsp; <br /><br />Use the best tools you can when you don&#039;t want your activities on the Internet to be tracked

				ive already confronted tails with some of these aquisations coming from liberte, and they have defended themselves quite well....infact they are waiting for liberte to put correct info on there.....thats all liberte has though, is fancy words and bashing tails....but yet,he recommends tails for anything other than what his intentions are...so its nuffsed for me....i still like it though....but i feel safer in my heart using tails... <br />
