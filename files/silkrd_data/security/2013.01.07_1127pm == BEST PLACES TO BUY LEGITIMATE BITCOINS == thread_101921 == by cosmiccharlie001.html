				Agreed, cosmiccharlie. I have read a plethora of posts on HOW is recommended, however, I have yet to find HOW to contact them. There is no &quot;Buy&quot; section, as someone had posted in one of the threads. I just wish there was one specific thread for ongoing BTC info. I am ready to make a purchase, and I have no BTCs, so I don&#039;t know what to do next.<br /><br />Any love out there, kind folks, for me and cosmiccharlie?<br /><br />BTW, I am in the US, and if at all possible, I would prefer not to leave the house. I am far out in the country.

				In the US. Do what I do. Create an account at http://mtgox.com (it is one of the best exchange markets for USD -&gt; BTC) and get verified. Also, create an account at dwolla.com (its kinda like paypal) and link a bank account / prepaid debit card thing. Then using your mtgox account follow the instructions to make a deposit via dwolla. It will send you to your dwolla account with the correct info filled out in the send funds page... enter the amount of usd you want to send and then just wait for funds to send. Time frame to send money is similar to paypay, like 2-5 business days once your money clears into dwolla it only takes another 24 hours or less to be posted into your mtgox account. Then buy the bitcoins and your done. No need to leave home.<br /><br />THIS IS ALSO THE CHEAPEST WAY!! the only fees your paying are to exchange the USD to BTC on mtgox and its only 0.06% + dwolla only charges $0.25 to send money.<br /><br />Sounds complicated i know but ive found this is the cheapest and most secure since dwolla and mtgox both have a great reputation.

				There is a quicker way too as in you&#039;ll get your coins instantly after sending money but does require you to go to a moneygram location likely. It also costs more.. $4 + 4% so basically youd hafta spend $104 to get $96 worth. Its bitinstant.com I have used them as well but realized using dwolla with mtgox is much cheaper.<br /><br />and the HOW in all this is just go to www.bitinstant.com and follow thier instructions. or better yet start out with mtgox.com you can also deposid money thier via bitinstant.com and itll explain the varios ways to deposit money there on the add funds page. Dwolla wont be avaliable as an option right after you sing up though becuase you need to be verified by mtgox first.

				One of the new threads here said that bitinstant is working with FEDS. Is that true? If so, I want to have nothing to do with them.

				Sycopunk: Thanks a ton for the info, but can you elaborate on what a &quot;bank account / prepaid debit card thing&quot; is? I really don&#039;t want to be giving them my personal bank account information. You know? Also, once I have the BTCs, how do I get them to SR?<br /><br />CaptainMal: Thanks to you, as well.

I heard alot of good things about his service in the bitcoin forums &amp; dealt with him before i even tried the moneypak for BTC services from any of the vendors on SR(which I only tried once &amp; was paranoid of a scam as it took 3days to get coins deposited &amp; i saw the vendor had already cashed out my MP)..but with btcquick I pay a 1.49 extra per coin(all vendors have fees) but at least i know i&#039;ll get my coins in under an hour in most cases...only downside to his service is having to buy a membership &amp; being verified first (keeps away chargeback scammers). <br />I&#039;ve bought/sold bitcoin on fleabay to people for months now with no scammer trouble also (pm if you want info)....But stay away from the bitcoinary as a friend of mine just got taken on there for almost $800...I told her 11.00 a btc was a scammer price &amp; she thought I was jealous she found a better price, 2 hours later, I got private keys for my 10btc but she got nothing &amp; she had to send in a scan of her ID &amp; a utillity biill to these guys &amp; it&#039;s been 6days.<br />virwox (not the one advertising on here, i&#039;m pretty sure thats also a scam,lol) you can use your paypal account to buy linden dollars the use the linden dollars to buy BTC....not my fave way, but another way to get 10btc or less without being scammed.<br />Alot of newbies get scammed because they don&#039;t stick with the start off small rule....I know you&#039;d get better rates sending a $500 MoneyPak but why risk that much $ on your first transaction because if they are legit, you can always go back for more. <br />I hope this helps you or someone else not get taken advantage of by those scammer bitches ;) <br />

				OK newbie, I will help you. Stop trying to buy bitcoins off the deepweb, that means either on SR or on this forum.<br /><br />Purchase the coins legitimately. Are you in the USA? Then use bitinstant.com.<br /><br />Your problem is now solved.

				I&#039;ve been on the road for a few months now. I&#039;ve used bitinstant and exchanged moneypaks. Got scammed and then i found blue sky traders. http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />I sent them an email for $2000 worth of bitcoins and they responded fast! I went to bank of america and filled out an out of state deposit.

				Bitcopia.com is easy, fast, and anonymous. It&#039;s one legit option and I recommend it.<br /><br />BTW, I fail to understand why some people think it is so difficult to find information about how to safely buy Bitcoins. All you need to do is read the forums here on these subjects. There are hundreds of messages and guides here that tell about how to do it (or NOT to do it). If you&#039;re lazy and don&#039;t want to dig a few pages into past topics, then sure, you might think that it&#039;s some kind of secret but really...come on! There is no reason why you should be in the dark or getting scammed when there is so much knowledge and data available for you here. Just don&#039;t be impatient. Take a bit of time to make sure you&#039;re going to be doing it right. Lots of us members have shared our advice and experiences to help you avoid the pitfalls. Most of us here aren&#039;t scammers and we don&#039;t want you to get scammed, either.
