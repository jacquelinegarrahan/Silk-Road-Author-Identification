				Ok so Story:<br /><br />&nbsp;I got new hardware, so I had to redownload all the blocks to sync with the network. I started doing that, but it once it got down to about 10k, it started to go painfully slow.<br /><br />I had already done a transaction so basically I was waiting for the network to sync to get my coins.<br /><br />Being impatient, I exported the wallet to another computer, which was already synced.<br /><br />Its been about an hour and I havent received the coins to the moved wallet.<br /><br />It shows with 10+ confirmations on blockchain.<br /><br />So my question is basically, do I have to wait until the original wallet syncs to get my coins?<br /><br />Thanks!

				It should have nothing to do with the bitcoin client. The coins are tied to an address in that wallet. You can export the private key for the bitcoin address and add it to a new wallet, or move the wallet to a new client, and the coins will show up wherever the private key for that bitcoin address is.<br /><br />Can you see the bitcoin address in the receiving addresses part of the bitcoin client?

				It shouldn&#039;t have anything to do with the original wallet.<br /><br />As for bitcoin clients, I recommend http://electrum.org/<br /><br />It has a function in which you can recover you wallet from a secret seed. Prevents the loss of bitcoins. And there is no waiting because it doesn&#039;t need to DL the blockchain.

				The last few thousand blocks will be slow because they&#039;re being verified, earlier ones have been locked in at some kind of checkpoint by the bitcoin developers to speed up the download. You need more processing power and disk throughput, and to leave it overnight.<br /><br />Also you can copy the block chain between computers, just copy blk*.dat from the up-to-date machine to the out of date one.
