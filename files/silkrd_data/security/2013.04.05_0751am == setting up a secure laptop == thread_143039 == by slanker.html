				So here is my plan. I buy a new laptop. I forget ﻿the reason why but you can be tracked by using an old comp. <br /><br />Than use Liberté Linux on a USB 3 stick also true crypt on top of that. <br /><br />Than to get online i would go to a Starbucks or something to access ﻿the for network. <br /><br />Are there any holes things I should do besides this

				I wanna know too!!!<br />Where&#039;d you hear about the using an old comp = bad?&nbsp; Is that a network card thing like do they ad a signature to packets maybe?<br />One suggestion I got from a friend is remove the hard drive from said laptop and just use usb sticks and ram.<br />They used Tails live usb at the library or on a harddiskless laptop on public wifi...<br />I&#039;m also curious about Tails vs other linux versions as you can&#039;t run software like gpg4usb which I like on Tails...&nbsp; I was going to try damn small linux.&nbsp; I also know very little about linux&nbsp; ???

				my x-stepfather use to be a blackhatter. He told me about it and I have found somethingon here about it a few months back. There is something stronger than those to. Search tail vs liberte its a vm within a vm. From lurking I have found using public wifis is a bad idea and MOST vpns don&#039;t do you any good. You are better off using a wps hacker and jacking someone&#039;s Wi-Fi with a range extender

				Not to plug my products, but check out the item description on my Security-hardened laptop. It might provide you some ideas:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1b52d9a7e4<br /><br />Or the X1 Carbon version:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2a8c69213f<br /><br />

				Your markup is high on the laptop. Well what I&#039;m really looking at right now if its safe to use public wifi like at mcdonalds or starbucks. Most of the chains don&#039;t install cameras at their locations. It is easier to into that than hack someone WPS. Hacking the WPS is hard due to the fact of signal strength on most people&#039;s home routers. Right now I&#039;m thinking the best option is using a new laptop and a USB 3 for the OS. Its much easier to hide a USB stick from the cops somewhere. They could spend years trying to find something that small.

				VPN&#039;s are no good because they can log your shit. What you want is a private bridge-https://cloud.torproject.org/. IMO if you&#039;re going to be at McDonald&#039;s anyway you don&#039;t even need that because you&#039;re going to be moving around.

				This looks interesting, changes the ip and what not but I don&#039;t see the increased security in it. I&#039;m not that tech savy maybe someone could explain it.

				I might recommend using a live CD rather than a USB, with stuff kept online or in a small portable hard drive (for the simple fact that they are much easier to wipe entirely) but other than that it sounds pretty reasonable. However if you can be forced by law to give over encryption passwords then ignore my last point and use a micro sd, very easy to hide and has even been suggested you could swallow it!

				Using your own connection with a vpn and bridge seems dumb.I know some vpns that take btc and claim not to log but if le ask them to let them to investigate they will corporate. A bridge I really don&#039;t understand how that works ontop of tor

				Pine thoughts:<br /><br />1. Using a laptop (they are super cheap nowadays and more than powerful enough) you bought with *cash* is a good idea.<br /><br />2. Loading your data onto a microSD is a good idea. Very easy to hide such a thing. Use your imagination. Running an OS from a microSD or a USB (apart from 1.0) won&#039;t be a problem at all, just get a decent one with decent speed (they have different up/down data transfer speeds depending on what you pay).<br /><br />3. If you take out the battery and run from power source, and you have your OS running in RAM e.g. live-usb, then there is literally zero evidence unless a SWAT team&nbsp; to freeze your RAM stick. Highly unlikely, it&#039;s a specialized operation. If somebody suddenly comes up behind you, simply moving the laptop 1/4 inch wipes everything. You could put all your stuff online in the cloud encrypted to the nth degree and download it onto an encrypted volume USB/microSD each time you use the laptop. Probably not necessary though unless you live in a totalitarian country which puts you in prison for not handing over your passphrase. Just encrypt it on the cloud or your USB/microSD.<br /><br />4. Buying hardware or software on SR is a dumb idea and it ALWAYS will be. Don&#039;t go down this path. Every time I hear about this being proposed it&#039;s such a WTF moment for me. Yes I&#039;m looking at you &quot;eddiethegun&quot; and any others like you. What are you even thinking? Trustmeabsolutely.com in here.<br /><br />5. A bridge is used in a similar way to a proxy when you don&#039;t want your ISP or others doing preliminary traffic analysis (the list of Tor entry guards is public, so if you have traffic going to those IP addresses then your ISP knows you&#039;re using Tor) and then knowing that you&#039;re using the Tor network. Getting a public bridge is easy and probably everybody should get a public or private bridge. Obtain one and then hop to Tor -&gt; Settings -&gt; Tick &quot;My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network.&quot; -&gt; Add Bridges. Like somebody else said, you can make your own private bridge.<br /><br />6. Using a VPN is a good idea if you want all your regular internet traffic encrypted and can serve a similar purpose to the use of bridges to prevent people knowing you&#039;re using Tor. Deep Packet Inspection is defeated by a VPN unless they are working with LE. This is why all Bittorent users should be using them. VPNs don&#039;t exist to make you anonymous, this is a misconception, they exist to provide data privacy between two points, data from your computer to the VPN&#039;s servers is fully encrypted, which can be a useful thing if you&#039;re searching for &quot;silk road&quot; on filternet (you don&#039;t search for silk road on the regular web do you...? It&#039;s a no-no...). But don&#039;t pay with credit card obviously.<br /><br />7. Don&#039;t use a traceable payment method for your internet access. If you can&#039;t help this, then you need to invest in learning some of the above techniques. If the LE agents trace communications to your real IP, although damning, it&#039;s not evidence of anything. So if you had adopted the &#039;live laptop&#039; approach, there&#039;s not much they could do (unless you regularly have kilos of weed and coke deposited about your dwelling, I mean WTF people! Why does this always happen! Why am I always reading about these guys?!)<br /><br />8. Ultimately everything just mentioned is icing on the cake. Nice-to-haves. Your threat model should determine how paranoid you are. Use Tor, use PGP, use your common sense and don&#039;t tell people you&#039;re from Ontario Canada like a guy just did in another thread.<br /><br />9. Buy bitcoins using OTC methods. Then launder them to boot. Major pain in the butt for LE. Do it. It&#039;s like putting a needle in a skyscraper made out of haystacks in Haystack City.
