				Hi, I&#039;m new to this site and almost ready to start buying. I&#039;m in the uk and I&#039;m looking for a way to purchase bitcoins without them being connected to me. If I run TOR browser from a USB thumb drive, and use instawallets, exchanging bitcoins for cash in the post, this will be reasonably anonymous right? It won&#039;t leave obvious trace on my laptop ( I&#039;m only gonna be buying small amounts so I&#039;m not seriously concerned my laptop will be seized, but id like to take some basic precautions). Alternatively I could buy them from intersango using my bank account but then flip em through a couple of instawallets and bitcoin fog? ( this seems slightly less secure to me). I had initially downloaded bitcoin to my laptop but I don&#039;t need this do I? Best to delete it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I used to order stuff from online pharmacys openly, this now seems terribly naive. <br />But it still seems that the weakest link in the chain is actually receiving the stuff.<br />Anymore advice would be greatly appreciated

				Quick read, FBI report on Bitcoin,<br />best and juciest info I could get out:<br /><br />&quot;&quot;<br />(U) What Users Can Do To Increase Anonymity16,17,18,19<br />· (U)Create and use a new Bitcoin address for each incoming payment.<br />· (U) Route all Bitcoin traffic through an anonymizer.<br />· (U) Combine the balance of old Bitcoin addresses into a new address to make new payments.<br />· (U) Use a specialized money laundering service.<br />· (U) Use a third-party eWallet service to consolidate addresses. Some third-party services offer the option of<br />creating an eWallet that allows users to consolidate many bitcoin address and store and easily access their<br />bitcoins from any device.<br />· (U) Individuals can create Bitcoin clients to seamlessly increase anonymity (such as allowing user to<br />choose which Bitcoin addresses to make payments from), making it easier for non-technically savvy users<br />to anonymize their Bitcoin transactions.<br />&quot;&quot;

				I also wondered...can I run the GPA software from a removable USB too? When I tried it my virus protection acted up; presumably I can&nbsp; instruct it to ignore it. It just occured to me that obviously despite all my precautions if I have all the public keys of SR vendors on my laptop its going to be a giveaway. At least if they are all on a USB I can a) hide it or b) stick it up my arse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously I realise that if my computer is seized by MI5 none of this amateur stuff will protect me....but I just want to outwit a nosey police officer having a look round after they seize a few valium. I cant see them sending their cyber crime team after me.
