				Hi everybody. Im new to Silk Road, Glad to have finally found a service like this!<br /><br />I think i understand the basics of how things work here like TOR and the GPG encryptions, but bitcoin is a little bit confusing.<br />As far as I can make out there are ways of buying&nbsp; bitcoin that can be tracked, Am I right in saying that? If so what exchange service should I stay away from?<br /><br />Can some one please tell me a safe way of getting cash or money from a VCC into bitcoin in Europe?<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t fully understand what the Bitcoin wallet is for or what bitcoin fog is used for.<br /><br />One last thing is it essential is use Liberte while using silk road?<br /><br />Sorry for all the noob questions just want to stay safe.&nbsp; :D

				Hey,<br />I haven&#039;t been here very long either, but I guess you&#039;d like a quick answer so I&#039;ll try...<br /><br />If you buy bitcoins by any means linked to you, there&#039;s obviously proof that you bought bitcoins. Not illegal, but you&#039;ll be more interesting (SR=drugs in mail+btc; so if they find both they will get some ideas, right?). And I think btc can be tracked by more sophisticated investigators. <br /><br />Bitcoins by cash you can buy from a vendor on SR called vlad1m1r, he has positive feedback, and is quite active in the security thread, so he might also help you with your questions. VCC I don&#039;t know. Maybe look at en.bitcoin.it (btc Wiki) to find merchants that accept them. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t gotten deep into the bitcoin science, was just searching ways to get them anonymously, so someone else can explain you more. <br />As I understand the wallet is an address (combination of letters and numbers in fact)&nbsp; linked to a number of btc that you can access, most merchant sites have so-called online wallets, you use it similarly to online banking (deposit/withdraw btc by sending them from/to another btc address). Please someone who understands this do explain it correctly, I just found it all worked, so I haven&#039;t read up on it (yet). <br /><br />Again from newbie perspective: Bitcoinfog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) splits up your transfers and mixes them with those of other bcf users, so it&#039;s much more difficult if not impossible to track them. If you use it to deposit into SR, your btc will come split up in small amounts over a few hours, min 6. Probably unnecessary when you&#039;ve bought your btc anonymously in the first place.<br /><br />Liberte and TAILS are live OS that run on your computer without leaving a trace. Your usual OS doesn&#039;t boot but instead the live OS is loaded into your RAM from a CD or USB stick. Shut down your computer - no trail of it anymore. It&#039;s recommended because the Tor browser bundle supposedly leaves traces on your HD that could point to SR. <br />I depends on what OS you have to make them work, this forum is full of guides how to use liberte/TAILS, and discussions on how secure they might actually be. <br /><br />Hope this helps for a start.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Tried my best ;)<br /><br />About vlad1m1r, I am actually trying him out now. But the letter can&#039;t have arrived yet. He answers fast to questions and is easy to deal with. So I don&#039;t really worry. And what he does is not that risky for him I guess, so he can make more money in the long run with repeat customers than by running with a weeks worth or so (till word gets out). I can&#039;t see how scamming would make sense from a business perspective.<br /><br />Yeah you don&#039;t really need a desktop wallet, it&#039;s probably safer, but I never used one. I think its not risky to have btc that are not linked to you deposited into your SR account. But you can use bitcoinfog if you&#039;re paranoid, but they charge a little fee and it takes time. <br /><br />Read up some more on security, I&#039;m no expert, and take the whole thing as the gamble that it is ;)<br /><br />If anyone thinks I&#039;m giving out bad/reckless advice correct me.

				I would highly recommend Vlad1m1r, he&#039;s a great guy that has a service where you send him cash in the mail in exchange for bitcoins. Great at helping a noob out (me) and have used him in the past.<br /><br />Locker.

				Yes vlad1m1r is really helpful! Good guy. I think he&#039;s in for the long run, and maybe also not just for the money. Ok, his price for anonymity seems a bit steep at first, but then what will it cost when you&#039;re in trouble?&nbsp; Just pm him already and follow your instinct :) As others said, he doesn&#039;t mind noob questions either. <br /><br />What I forgot, if you were online on SR using your Tor browser bundle, you should backup important files somewhere and reinstall your OS after wiping your HD. OSX: Disk Utility, Win: DBAN. <br /><br />hel

				As mentioned by almost everyone else, as you are in the UK vlad1m1r is your best local agent for this sort of transaction.
