				Hello everyone<br /><br />I have been looking for a means to buy BTC with a credit card, and I have found one.<br /><br />Pros: reliable. secure. not *that* expensive. fast. worldwide.<br />Cons: You need to identify yourself. You will pay a premium. <br /><br />I bought some coins this morning from buybitcoins.com. The preev rate was 115$ per BTC and I paid 130$ per BTC.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works:<br /><br />1. You register<br />2. You upload come ID scans: passport did it for me<br />3. You enter your real phone number<br />4. you allow your borswer to gelocate you<br /><br />This builds trust points. You need to do 2 and 3 - 4 is optional.<br /><br />5. You bid for the coins.<br />6. You receive an email saying your bid is live <br />7. You confrim the bid in the site<br />8. The coins appear on your site account<br />9. You then withdraw the coins to (say) your blockchain wallet<br />10. Withdrawal showed up instantly in my wallet.<br /><br />Be prepared for a dealy and a phone call if, like me, you do not register with your real name (ie the name on the ID and credit card)<br /><br />All major cards accepted. Seems to be worldwide.<br /><br />I liked it. It was quick easy and very secure. Personally I don;t mind about being identified since I am more concerned about being robbed than being nabbed, especially if you run the coins through another wallet prior to transferring them to SR.<br /><br />If anyone has questions I will watch this thread. I have no affiliation with these people&nbsp; - just came across the site, took a punt and was quite surprised that it was legitimate.

Centralized exchanges sucks. A p2p crypto currency desserves better.<br /><br />Bitcoin-OTC is a great way to get coins too... (often same sellers as on LocalBitcoins).

				OP, you might want to consider running your coins though Bitcoin Fog after purchasing them with your credit card. A little extra security never hurt anyone ;)

				Hello everyone. <br /><br />I almost always buy my coins OTC, but due to my only having a credit card handy I determined to find out whether it was possible to get BTC with it. It worked. <br /><br />The chap Joey, I suppose, could very well nick off with your money. Mind you he does ask for ID and did phone me (since I registered with a nickname and not my real name). <br /><br />He seems legit to me. Anyway the service exists, was quick, and looked perfectly legal and tickety-boo to me.
