				Yes, I had a similar problem a few days ago. Although I never took any coins from anybody even though I got offered, because the rise in value of bit coin went up. I suppose I can just wait, I&#039;m sure it will go up again but it might go down and I don&#039;t really feel like buying more bit coins when all I really need is 0.1 bitcoin ya know? lol<br /><br />And I did have enough money for my purchase.... SO MUCH in fact, that I had some left over... but i&#039;m literally 10 cents short of this second purchase that I want to spend my money on.

				But thanks for making everyone think I&#039;m probably trying to scam them, I&#039;m sure everyone is looking forward to helping me now. :)<br /><br />ALSO, i guess I only need 10 cents... I&#039;m not sure in bit coins how much that is lol... but it&#039;s chump change, like I&#039;m really gonna try and steal 10 cents..

People will make their own decisions based on the information presented to them.<br />The first time obviously didn&#039;t teach you that you always need to buy more Bitcoin than you&#039;ll need for your order to cover yourself for Bitcoin fluctuations or other unexpected events.<br /><br />0.1 BTC is currently $1.09 USD. To cover your order you need 0.0010 BTC. Regardless of the fact that it&#039;s &#039;chump change&#039;, you&#039;re asking for someone else&#039;s chump change to cover your order.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I need 10 cents... not $1.09.<br /><br />And I did not come up short on an order........ I bought about 5 more bitcoins than i needed for my purchase. I was left without about 5 additional bitcoins and figured i&#039;d spend them on something else. I found the PERFECT item and came up 10 cents short... so naturally I&#039;m here.

The truth is I had some left over money after a purchase, I found an item i really wanted and was only 10 cents short of being able to get it. So I came onto these forums and kindly asked for assistance. Then I get told to lick balls and all this other sandbagging.<br />That&#039;s the only truth I see.<br /><br />&nbsp;I understand people are skeptical of scams and what not, but it&#039;s none of your business who decides to help me and who doesn&#039;t.

You asked for 0.1 BTC though, which is $1.09. You need 0.001 BTC, not 0.1.<br /><br />You came up short for your previous order, as stated in your thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40613.msg447659#msg447659<br /><br />If you were not short, then why were you asking in the forum for 30 cents to make a purchase? You stated there that you were short, yet you state here that you had 5 Bitcoin left after making the purchase.<br /><br />Now you&#039;re using those 5 Bitcoin (which you had left over from your previous purchase) to make another purchase, but are finding yourself a little short once again. You could not have had 5 Bitcoin left over from the previous purchase if you were short 30 cent for the order. It&#039;s literally impossible.

I spent all my bit coin on that same day (i made the purchase right when the value of bitcoin got high enough lol).. and i just got a MP yesterday and ordered some coins today.<br /><br />And i apologize for asking for 0.1 bitcoin... I was ten cents short and thought .1 bitcoin was about 10 cents. My mistake.
