				or the paranoid android setup!<br /><br />I wanted to create a thread to gather all IT experts around the forum and try to create a tutorial for a safe system. We (buyers) do not need to go into extreme measures as vendors. But some of us have life&#039;s to protect and want to be as secure as possible. Even if the setup involves 3 desktops with 3 operating systems I don&#039;t care, the purpose of this thread is solely security and anonymity. <br /><br />We should create a list with all the do&#039;s and dont&#039;s of security and of possible setups. Later it could evolve to a tutorial updated as needed.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of things to worry about such as browse configuration, mac adress, dns requests. . etc.<br />I already read the Tor guides, black hat surfing, etc.. but<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t be great to gather all the info on the same topic?<br /><br />I would organize it and update it here.<br /><br />For now since I&#039;m not an expert I will just leave some questions around and count with your valuable knowledge<br />Please feel free to post your thoughts and setups.<br />************************************************************************************************************<br />For now we have:<br /><br />-&gt; Operating System:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*some OS are more &quot;hacker resitant&quot; than others.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*linux and BSD are pretty good .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*FreeBSD- a lot of security potential but you need some &quot;advance&quot; knowledge to configure them.(lacks ASLR)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Hardened Gentoo (Liberte)- can be secured in great detail if you have time and know what you are doing (has ASLR.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Tails can be used in a USB stick oe even in a live CD if you are paranoid about traces.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*OpenBSD- good out of the box security but as soon as you install some software you can create some vulnerabilities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Other solutions like plan9, inferno, sel4 are still developing so if you have any experince with them feel free to.<br /><br /><br />DO&#039;S<br /><br />*You should use bridges (public are ok but If you can find a private one that you trust it&#039;s even better)<br />If you&#039;re a vendor or someone that&#039;s a more valuable target to LE then I would suggest finding a trustworthy private bridge.<br />*You should spoof your mac adress If you are running wireless connection<br />*You can try to connect to a neighbor&#039;s wifi (be sure to change the mac adress) or even crack it if it&#039;s wep. (there is a lot of info out there related to wep cracking)<br />*If you are using VMware Workstation make sure you check the option <br />HardDisk -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Independet -&gt; Nonpersistent<br />This changes the disks to nonpersistent mode so no info is saved to the disks, and the info is lost when the virtual machine is powered off or reset.<br />*You should use hidden volumes with True Crypt so if you get caught you can always open the first volume and they will not even know there is a second volume. Use a strong password for the &quot;open&quot; volume and a strong password for the hidden volume.<br />*You should remove the&nbsp; exi metadata from all images you post. Not doing this can expose a lot of info including your GPS location if it was shot with a mobile phone. There will be a tutorial on how to do this.<br /><br />DONT&#039;S<br /><br />*Do Not open .onion websites outside Tor Browser Bundle.<br />*Do Not surf both the darknet and clearnet at the same time (could be a problem&nbsp; if connection dies for example so better be on the safe side)<br />*Do Not use JavaScript when using Tor because there is a greater security risk (althought it can give you a greater browser fingerprint)<br />*Do Not use a private bridge connected with any illegal activity if you don&#039;t trust the person or group who is running it<br />*Do Not use wireless connection (connect via ethernet instead) if you want less security risks (there is no problem with wireless connection you just have to take the adequate measures to use it)<br /><br /><br />Sub guides to include in the future:<br /><br />#Spoofing Mac Adress<br />#Setting up private and public bridges<br />#Removing exi metadata from images<br /><br />#Securing the entry node with VPN (https://tails.boum.org/todo/vpn_support/)<br />#Securing the exit node with proxy<br /># obfsproxy<br /><br />

				The ONLY way I access SR or anything to do with it is using MS VirtualPC. The entire OS is encapsulated in one big VM file. I think it is better then a USB card since I can lose that or someone can take it. If I have to ditch my VM quickly I can just delete the entire VM itself. Then I can use SDELETE multiple times on my drive. Then I&#039;m safe. Now, if the ever chance I got busted on and charged through my door i may have a hard time doing all that. This is why I created a batch file which I just double click on that will erase the VM and run sdelete automatically. There are also hard drive killer programs out there that I may check out too. Also, when you communicate private/sensitive information ALWAYS use PGP. If you don&#039;t know how to use it, then LEARN IT. Never use a vendor that doesn&#039;t at least provide it.

				thanks for your answe opentoe.<br /><br />1- why did you need to create the batch file? <br />If you are not at home when you&#039;re raided you are f*cked! Wouldn&#039;t be easier to make whole disk encryption with TC for example. On top of that you could encrypt the VM with another software / password. With a strong password that would be difficult to decrypt right<br /><br />2- Are there any temporary files leaking from VM usage to the other OS?<br />&nbsp;

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1-Which operating system is your favourite for anonimity?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Strictly speaking, the operating system has not a whole lot to do with anonymity although some are more resistant to hackers than others. Hackers can indirectly pwn your anonymity by rooting you and getting your IP address around Tor. They could also directly pwn Tor by either hacking you through a vulnerability in it or by rooting the relays you use. There are several nice operating systems. Anything Linux or BSD is pretty good. OpenBSD focuses heavily on out of the box security, although the box doesn&#039;t have much in it until you add programs that are probably not anywhere near as secure as a base OpenBSD install. It does have technologies for making some sorts of vulnerabilities non exploitable though, for example ASLR. FreeBSD is another OS that has a lot of security potential, it has a very extensive and highly configurable selection of security modules, but you will need to learn how to use them and this is not trivial. FreeBSD also lacks ASLR which is pretty shitty imo. Hardened Gentoo has probably got the most depth to its potential security, in that it has a lot of configurable security modules as well as having out of the box features like ASLR. I think that Hardened Gentoo can probably be secured to a greater degree than OpenBSD or FreeBSD if you know what you are doing and take the time to do it. There are various other solutions that are much more esoteric: plan9, inferno, sel4, etc.... I honestly know little about these solutions, but I am under the impression that they can be much more secure than either Linux or BSD. sel4 is a formally verified microkernel meaning that it is in theory probably impossible to hack&nbsp; (but in reality some of the assumptions they make don&#039;t hold yet, so it is not unhackable in practice yet). It is also not open source, although it has been reviewed by several people. I think sel4 is seen as largely an academic exercise still.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It it dangerous to try to enter .onion site on the clearnet browser?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unless you are very sure that you don&#039;t need to, you should use the Tor Browser Bundle.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Can we browse the deep web and clearnet ate the same time?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It can open you up to some problems, especially if you are browsing the same site anonymously and nonanonymously simultaneously and you connection dies. In general, it is pretty safe if you avoid this, I would not worry about it. Especially if you are only surfing .onion sites<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why does the browser in liberte come with the javascript enabled?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Probably because they are dumbasses and like javascript. Having javascript enabled does give you a bigger browser fingerprint crowd to hide in, but I personally find the increased risk to haxx0ring to be unacceptable.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should we use bridges? Public or private?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ideally you will use a private bridge that you find anywhere other than SR (or other illegal channels), public bridge is okay though.

I guess it&#039;s all the same the only difference is that virtual box&nbsp; is free and open source i think.<br />6- Which free open source alternatives do we have similiar to truecrypt? Not for whole disk encyption but rather for a folder. Strong encprytion also.<br />7- What is browser fingerprint and why is it so important? I know that your browser can have unique characteristics that can diffenceriate from others but how is that going to reveal who you are or where you are? Any good website to test browser fingerprint? What&#039;s an acceptable minimum number of browsers equal to our broswser?<br /><br />I could go on but that&#039;s it for now otherwise it gets to confusing to get straight answers.<br /><br />If anything is wrong just correct me!<br /><br />Thanks for the support

Securing these is of the most importance - whether that&#039;s by using a VPN with Tor and then an encrypted proxy to hide the exit node as well or any other method.<br /><br />Tor is so innovative in that out of the box it can provide novice users with such powerful anonymity that avid hackers a decade ago would have seen as a godsend. The problem is when you&#039;re trying to secure Tor&#039;s vulnerable entry/exit nodes, by whichever method, it&#039;s important to both understand and keep up to date on these methods or you&#039;re going to end up more vulnerable than you were without using them at all.

				I was doing VPN &gt; TOR for a while until I kept reading it was a bad thing to do, mainly the creators of tails made me think twice before using a VPN with TOR.<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/todo/vpn_support/<br /><br /><br />1- Which operating system do you prefer?<br />I prefer using tails on a usb because it&#039;s easily accessible and is very secure.<br /><br />2-It it dangerous to try to enter .onion site on the clearnet browser?<br />Yes.<br /><br />3- Can we browse the deep web and clearnet ate the same time?<br />If you absolutely have to make sure to use a different browser like chrome. <br /><br />4-Why does the browser in liberte come with the javascript enabled?<br />Javascript can be dangerous and used to track you or hack into your computer so I would always disable it. The browser in liberte is only to be used when you need to access sites you can&#039;t normally access via TOR such as mtgox. <br /><br />5- Should we use bridges? Public or private?<br />Public bridges are okay to use but if you&#039;re a vendor or someone that&#039;s a more valuable target to LE then I would suggest finding a trustworthy private bridge. <br /><br /><br />Secure Tor Setup:<br />-Install tails on a usb stick or a cd if you&#039;re paranoid that you might leave data on the usb (cd is read-only) <br />-Get a second usb/memory card and encrypt it using truecrypt but make sure to encrypt with a hidden partition. <br />-Select an easy/crackable password for the outer volume and then make the password for the hidden partition very strong/secure. <br />-On your outer volume put embarrassing things (Pictures of your ex, naked pics of dudes, etc) that way if you&#039;re ever forced to decrypt your drive you&#039;ll just facepalm and say &quot;Okay you found my secret you asshole.&quot;<br />-On your hidden partition keep all of your sensitive info and make sure to even PGP text files just in case. <br />-Try to connect to a neighbor&#039;s wifi, chances are there are some unsecured ones. If there aren&#039;t any unsecured networks then check to see if any of them are locked with WEP, they are easy to crack but you&#039;ll have to figure that out on your own. <br />

				lol, stacking stuff together doesn&#039;t make things more secure.<br />This is as ridiculous as those n00bs discussing about key-lengths in cryptographic systems.<br /><br />Using Tor first and then to VPNs is a bad idea, and it doesn&#039;t add more security.<br />In fact, those noobs talking about &quot;rooting&quot; you through TOR, I dare them to show me a single case of such thing happening.<br /><br />Tor is not just a chain of sockets, it has a very definite architecture that is designed to be very resilient.<br />Researchers around the world still didn&#039;t find a single serious weakness in it.<br /><br />The operating system is important, but more than the OS that you are using what really matters is what services/daemons you are running in the background.<br />In fact, generally speaking if you are not running a server, the opportunities of being &quot;rooted&quot; is close to nil, unless you fall in a social engineering attack.<br /><br />A windows workstation with no services running will be infinitely more secure than a old linux installed by a n00b with an outdated sendmail daemon.<br />It is not what you are using, but how the hell you use it and how well you know your shit.<br /><br />The VPN before Tor is not really to strengthen Tor at all, Tor is very good by itself alone. And no, it is not to protect you from the entry node. That statement just demonstrates that they don&#039;t understand a shit about how Tor works.<br /><br />The ONLY reason of why you should be using a VPN before starting a Tor session is just as a extra safety measure in the case that there is a leak from your computer, ie. if you have forgotten to turn of Java or Flash (or asx, docx, etc...) and someone tries to create a side-channel leak by creating a direct connection to you circumventing the Tor network.<br />The VPN would offer a second layer of defense to that kind of attacks, it is a safety net in the case that Tor is bypassed.<br /><br />Of course, if you are using the Tor Bundle, such type of attacks are prevented by default, but still. Someone could have found an obscure vulnerability and be exploiting a side-channel, and in the remote event that that happens, you are already covered.<br /><br />In short, VPN+TOR is a good combination.<br />TOR+VPN is dumb, and the explanation of why it is dumb is very long. But believe me, it is stupid.<br /><br />If you are worried about exit nodes, just use HTTPS always by default. Period.<br />I honestly don&#039;t give a shit about exit nodes because I only use hidden services.<br /><br />Now regarding to your questions:<br />1-Which operating system is your favourite for anonimity?<br />OS has nothing to do with anonymity.<br />It is irrelevant, I can be perfectly anonymous in any OS.<br /><br />2-It it dangerous to try to enter .onion site on the clearnet browser?<br />If it is regarding to anonymity, you MUST be sure to disable all plugins, add-ons, scripts, java.<br />Although counter-intuitive, you should leave javascript on. Turning Javascript off makes you very easily uniquely identifiable in browser fingerprinting, therefore it makes you less anonymous, even when you are using TOR.<br /><br />The best advice is to use the TOR Bundle which it comes pre-configured properly to keep you anonymous.<br />If you don&#039;t know what you are doing, just don&#039;t touch anything and use it as it comes.<br /><br />3- Can we browse the deep web and clearnet ate the same time?<br />Sure. Although who knows, maybe one &quot;deep web&quot; site is vulnerable to CSRF and a clearnet exploits it, but nah... what are the odds.<br /><br />4-Why does the browser in liberte come with the javascript enabled?<br />Read #2<br /><br />5- Should we use bridges? Public or private?<br />No need really, unless tor is being censored by a government,<br /><br />6- DNS requests<br />Use Tor Bundle and don&#039;t worry about DNS leaks.<br /><br />7-Mac adress spoof<br />Ludicrous, mac addresses are never leaked to the internet.<br />You can spoof it for fun if you want, but it is neither going to increase your security nor anonymity.<br /><br />8- VPNs, privoxy, etc..<br />Bleh, I am done.

				If you use a VPN service to connect to Tor, then yes they will have your IP and could see you connect to a Tor IP. This isn&#039;t an issue if you create your own VPN. My thinking on this is you can change your IP often, on the fly with a socks proxy, so if LE did get your ISP to provide information, they wouldn&#039;t see an IP pattern and would have to go through every IP you connect to 1 by 1? Not likely, but the first thing they would likely do is look and see if you connected to any Tor IP&#039;s.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a post from tor-talk that is very similar to my setup:<br />Setup your own Tor VPN. Similar like JanusVM. Really create your own Tor VPN as JanusVM is closed source, unsecure and unmaintained. One virtual machine running Linux will provide a VPN server and forward all traffic trough Tor. Then use another virtual machine which has no direct internet access but lan-only access to the Tor VPN virtual machine. And connect the VPN. After the VPN is running you can add a proxy to firefox. I tested that myself and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately I tested it with JanusVM and not my own Tor VPN, I am still working on that. This setup could be great, Tor is hiding your ass, Tor Browser is well configured, https everywhere helps a bit to stop eavesdropping of exit servers and proxy servers and you might be even able to use the firefox addon steatlhy to comfortable turn on/off some untrusted extra proxy.

				From the official Tor site:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">you -&gt; VPN/SSH -&gt; Tor<br /><br />You can route Tor through VPN/SSH services. That prevents your ISP etc from seeing that you&#039;re using Tor. Generally, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won&#039;t stand out as much. SSH tunnels are not so popular.<br /><br />Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine&#039;s default Internet connection, and the Tor Browser Bundle will route through it.<br /><br />This can be a fine idea, assuming your VPN/SSH provider&#039;s network is in fact sufficiently safer than your own network.<br /><br />Another advantage here is that it prevents Tor from seeing who you are behind the VPN/SSH. So if somebody does manage to break Tor and learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN/SSH was actually following through on their promises (they won&#039;t watch, they won&#039;t remember, and they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then you&#039;ll be better off.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t understand what your problem with VPN + TOR is. It is maybe a bad with Tails, but not everyone is using Tails, so just fuck off with your VPN+TOR=BAD talk. What exactly is so bad to route Tor through an anonymous VPN with no logging?

				^There&#039;s nothing wrong with it at all. It&#039;s just a redundant step for MOST. Connecting through a VPN/SSH tunnel first would benefit anyone who doesn&#039;t want to be flagged as a tor user. If you don&#039;t use bridges (and even then...), it is pretty easy to fingerprint you as a tor user. This can be very bad for some, like the last lulzsec guy, who was caught thanks to a tor timing correlation attack.<br /><br />If you receive suspicious packages in the mail that some agent/cop thinks came from SR, it can be very bad for you to be identified as a tor user, especially if they have a way to watch SR and correlate the timing between the packets you are exchanging with them. If they tap your internet connection or wifi and see that you are connecting to a Swedish VPN rather than a known tor node or public bridge, then they are SOL. If they somehow gain the VPN&#039;s logs (don&#039;t believe the no logs BS -- there are always logs at some level), they may see that you are using tor, but they likely won&#039;t be able to correlate it with your activity unless they have live access. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it can&#039;t be done, but it will take far more resources for them to get past the &quot;Oh damn, he&#039;s using a VPN and not tor like we expected&quot; part. Unless you&#039;re a vendor, I highly, highly doubt they would bother going this far. OK, maybe for one buyer just to make an example out of you, but not everyone else. Believe it or not, this is not some routine stuff they do all day every day. Only a few dozen agents throughout all the LEAs are actually trained in this shit; the rest have a basic understanding and can&#039;t do much without the use of third party tools from private contractors, a la skiddies. I really wouldn&#039;t worry about the later unless you are extremely careless, and the former are wayyyy too busy dealing with foreign government sponsored hackers and whatnot to care right now. <br /><br />Please continue to be paranoid, just know that at some point you reach a level where your preparations cost more than they provide. Make sure security is tight everywhere: your PCs, your mobile phones, MP3 players, smart phones, dumb phones, the front of your house, your toilet, and most importantly: YOUR MOUTH. Don&#039;t waste all your time turning your computer into a barely usable fortress if you&#039;re going to brag about all the keWL dRuGz ur ordering on the interwebs. That does for posting your personal details throughout your stay on SR and the SR forums too. Something like 90% of convictions (and even the initial arrests) are a result of self incrimination. Don&#039;t be a witness against yourself and STFU when it comes to SR, especially if you are ever questioned. Politely decline any questions and ask for a lawyer if pressed. I know it&#039;s been said a million times before, but I&#039;ll say it again because it&#039;s THAT important. <br /><br />It&#039;s tough not to talk about SR with your friends, EVER (NOT EVEN FUCKING ONCE). Same goes for slipping personal details onto the forums or to vendors. Just remember, the hardest things are always the most important. Want to make some cash? Even better! Don&#039;t tell anyone where you get your pure MDMA or that strain of bud that makes your eyes roll back. Instead of letting them know about SR so they can try to buy the shit themselves (probably leaving more clues for LE along the way), save your money and buy the shit in bulk, then resell it to the same pricks who are likely begging you for your source, just so they can have it all to themselves. At least now you&#039;ll have a reason to encrypt your hard drive and cover your tor traffic with a VPN, bridges, or whatever :). If you keep this operation small, it will pay for your drugs and allow you to brag to your friends without revealing your connection to SR. Everyone wins! Well, except your friends, but would THEY tell you about SR if they were the ones getting the cool drugs off the internets? LOL

				No problem!<br /><br />If there are hotspots readily available nearby, I&#039;d say do that instead of using something registered to yourself, although I wouldn&#039;t recommend going out of your way to find them if you&#039;re just ordering personal use amounts in the US, unless of course you have reason to believe your house/area is being watched. If you do use them, make sure you change your MAC address every time and don&#039;t stick to the same wifi if possible. The more random and unpredictable your movements, the better.

In a large city, this isn&#039;t much of a problem though. Chilling in a big apartment building with tons of other wifi users surrounded by other buildings filled with wifi activity on every channel obviously makes for some good cover, especially if you&#039;re accessing an AP at a moderate distance. In this situation, I would still switch APs at random though, just in case. Hacking small WEP keys is simple with the right equipment, and you can find sites that will instantly convert older Verizon FIOS router SSIDs (the ones that look like &quot;FDZR1&quot;) to their default WEP keys.

				Also keep in mind that even if you enter with a node in Fuckamericastan and exit with a node in Allahzakia , if you are in the USA you are passively exposed to USA infrastructure on your way to the entry, and if you are visiting a server in USA (or even one that is in some other country but the route to it passes through USA) you are passively exposed to USA infrastructure between your exit and the server. So a fully USA based passive timing attack will still work, even if the VPN nodes you are using are not actively owned by the FBI (which of course they could be, if I was the FBI I would certainly want to have some &quot;anonymous VPN!&quot; nodes in both Fuckamericastan and Allahzakia)

				@DomesticShrooms &amp; @kmfkewm<br />When you guys bring me ONE case of such attacks used by the federal government to track down anybody, I will buy you both a beer keg for each one.<br />Theoretical analysis of weaknesses is fine for academics, but law enforcement needs practicality and something that can be admissible as evidence in a court of law, being freaking sure that it is acquired without violating the forth and the fifth amendment. It is quite trickier than you think.<br />Unlike what people commonly believe, these agencies don&#039;t have unlimited resources... unless it is an incident with public interest with high political value.<br /><br />Remember, everything is about economics: Is it worth the trouble? Which means:<br />1) Is anybody really giving a shit about it?<br />2) Is it pissing off a lot of powerful people?<br />3) Is the incident making the government look weak or stupid?<br />4) Is it critically endangering our national security?<br /><br />If none of above is true, then they will have to juggle with limited budget, and if it is not solvable in reasonable amount of time it will go straight to the file cabinet.<br />Btw, this strategy is not only based on VPNs, which you might have to provide personal information to hire such service which would defeat the whole purpose.<br />The mindset I am trying to explain to you guys is &quot;the&quot; strategy for seasoned people who have rooted boxes or use open socks around the world.<br /><br />Regarding to commercial VPNs, obviously having an IP address from X country doesn&#039;t make you legally secure. What you really have to look at is what country is that company registered and what court of what country they are willing to work in the case of litigations, that&#039;s called JURISDICTION and GOVERNING LAW (aka. applicable law or choice of law) clauses in either their Legal Notice or Privacy Policy or in your contract.<br />You must browse and read carefully your contract, the Term of Services and their privacy policies of ANY company in the world, no matter if it is a online or offline company.<br />Therefore if you are planning to attack the US and you feel safe because you just bought a VPN node with a Russian IP, without checking the legalese to see if the company is actually registered in the US, you are being an absolute idiot.<br /><br />Actually using any commercial VPN which is not funded/administered by pirate/hacktivist groups, it is a very dumb move if you are planning to do something very shady.<br /><br />In any case, neglecting the power of politics in traceability is being n00b.<br /><br />PS:<br />Also, as I said before: one thing is to be playing against the government.<br />Another whole different game is to be playing against an active team of fierce hackers who don&#039;t give a fuck about bureaucracy, chain of custody, constitutionality, having one single objective: to catch you.<br /><br />For the mentality of the nerdy hacker it might seem trivial to be a single click away to deploy a honeypot or execute a remote exploit.<br />But if you are working for the federal government you can&#039;t just click enter and get away with it, before doing that you must send memos to five different departments, wait to get it approved from them all, get the order from a judge. If the target is overseas, then after all that you&#039;ll have to get in contact with the chancellor or the ambassador, get a translator, get it notarized and apostilled, get in touch with the judges of the foreign country, get their authorization, wait until they release their subpoena or the equivalent to that, get in contact with the isp, pray that their legal team don&#039;t fight back... etc... and if you were smart enough whenever they get an authorization to finally take a peek at the logs (if any was saved) your trail will be long cold if you were smart enough to move on.<br />(If you were wise in your choices, they will have no logs to do any type analysis)<br /><br />You guys can&#039;t think about the weaknesses of the government, maybe because you are inexperienced or too young to understand bureaucracy. You simply think &quot;If I was the fbi...&quot;, no the fbi can&#039;t do that, and don&#039;t have the time to do that, and they simply don&#039;t operate that way.<br />Say thanks to our constitution, to international treaties, political conflicts, and the cuts in their budgets

				thanks for all the info re: vpn&#039;s. first off i just want to say that i am not doing anything too shady and only started looking into using one because i torrent a lot and know that next month the <br />&#039;secret&#039; spying/sharing of user logs by ISP&#039;s and the government will go into effect. this is in response to them not being able to pass SOPA.<br /><br />basically my thinking is that having this extra layer over others will keep me off their easy target list. also, i found that when using a vpn my ISP no longer can track my download usage so I can use it to circumvent their download quotas.<br /><br />here is the torrentfreak article for those that are interested.<br />http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007

				The concept of using a VPS to set up a private VPN/SSH tunnel to hide your tor traffic is legit; in fact I think I mentioned it in this thread. I recommend such a technique for anyone who either purchases large amounts of drugs off SR (especially from overseas), or vends anything illegal. It will add an extra step to any attempt at confirming your use of tor or to traffic timing correlation attacks aimed at said service.<br /><br />Can&#039;t speak for the exact steps anonaddict listed, but I did notice this part: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your ISP will be able to do deep packet inspection and find out all the tor sites and other shit you decide to do through tor.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />DPI will not decrypt tor traffic. An ISP can use DPI to see that you are connected to tor, but it will not tell them what you are actually doing on it.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t recommend using the hidden operating system thing, especially if you aren&#039;t familiar with IT. If you accidentally boot up the fake OS, you risk overwriting data on the hidden OS, which is contained within the free space on the same partition. Depending on which country you&#039;re in and who your opponent is, you won&#039;t get much plausible deniability when they look up the fake OS and identify that it&#039;s never been used by studying the file access dates and system logs. If you do use it, try and make it look like the disk/thumb drive containing your fake and hidden OS is a backup drive in order to explain the lack of modifications.

Doesn&#039;t this defeat the purpose of setting up one of these yourself since you have to log all of your own activity that goes through it, doing exactly what it is you were scared private vpn&#039;s would be doing to you?

Do you keep ANY logs which would allow you or a 3rd party to match an IP address and a time stamp to a user of your service? If so, exactly what information do you hold?<br /><br />“We absolutely do not maintain any VPN logs of any kind. We utilize shared IP addresses rather than dynamic or static IPs, so it is not possible to match a user to an external IP. These are some of the many solutions we have implemented to enable the strongest levels of anonymity amongst VPN services. Further, we would like to encourage our users to use an anonymous e-mail and pay with Bitcoins to ensure even higher levels of anonymity should it be required. Our core verticals are privacy, quality of service, and prompt customer support.”<br /><br /><br />2. Under what jurisdictions does your company operate and under what exact circumstances will you share the information you hold with a 3rd party?<br /><br />“Our company currently operates out of the United States with gigabit gateways in the US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. We chose the US, since it is one of the only countries without a mandatory data retention law. We will not share any information with third parties without a valid court order. With that said, it is impossible to match a user to any activity on our system since we utilize shared IPs and maintain absolutely no logs.”<br /><br /><br />

				The set up seems good though i am not a expert so there may be holes I don&#039;t see. As sourman pointed out, DPI will not reveal what sites you visit ect, all they can see is that you used tor - not yet illegal :p<br />I would say that I don&#039;t see the need for a VPN, surely using a simple SSH tunnel (like the free shellmix one) would be just as good? The ISP could see you accessing the tunnel but good luck to them picking out your traffic from the huge volume that must be flowing through a big public tunnel like that :p I suppose you could use obfsproxy on top of that as well if you think LE are THAT determined to get you, though running tails from a DVD compiling it from scratch each and every time means I only use for buying rather than browsing though with more peristance that wouldn&#039;t really be an issue.

Even if the exit node is in the same ISP (rare, unless you are forcing it), they can&#039;t tell whose traffic coming out of the node belongs to whom.<br />The only thing they could do is a correlation attack, but that type of attack is more an academic exercise and not really that practical in the real world.<br /><br />A correlation attack can only be done if:<br />1) Both entry node and exit nodes are reachable for monitoring (ie. if both entry and exit nodes are in the same isp)<br />2) They must have the hunch that your specific encrypted traffic (out of millions of customers) corresponds to the unencrypted traffic coming out of a specific exit node (out of hundreds), to then compare the traffic of these two specific nodes for statistical analysis.<br /><br />The countermeasure that TOR has to avoid this is to randomly choose entry nodes and exit nodes, therefore *your* isp will never have both ends available for analysis.<br />And even if they had them both, it is like finding a needle in a haystack. <br /><br />Of course, the worry about the exit nodes is superfluous if you are only using hidden services, no point in worrying about exit nodes when you are never exiting tor. Some people seems to be confused about it, so I thought it was worth mentioning.

				My logic could be flawed here but if you lock your laptop down and do some wardriving and make sure you are encrypted why not just drive around till you hit an open network.&nbsp; Logiin to SR make your order or make your payment&nbsp; and be in and out in 5 minutes on your way home. <br /><br />Why even&nbsp; risk doing it from your home/address? When this option is available? Unless you just do not own a laptop.<br /><br />If there are flaws to this&nbsp; please tell me&nbsp; cause I would like to know and always welcome to further educating my self.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Good to know.<br /><br />I like to hear people argue about this topic, even if they disagree. This kind of shit is sometimes difficult for me to wrap my head around and it&#039;s only possible when informed people assert their opinion on it.
