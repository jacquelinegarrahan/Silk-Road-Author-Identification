				Hello folks, lets say I wanted to play a game with one of my LE friends and send him a letter. What steps can i take to make sure the letter would not be able to be traced back to me. Precautions such as using gloves to avoid fingerprints and Legit return address, but not my address are all a given. Any Ideas on how to fool handwriting analysis in the event that an investigation occurs to check who wrote the letter. Perhaps the letter should be sprayed/washed with something to destroy any biological evidence of someone handling it. Can anyone chime in her on sending untraceable letters?

				Sorry, sounds like an absolutely stupid idea.&nbsp; Make sure you don&#039;t take any of us down with your stupidity.<br /><br />Why would you even think of doing that?<br /><br />Grow up.

				This is an extremely poor idea, for a whole manner of reasons.<br />Please do not do this, and please nobody advise him on how to avoid forensic detection.<br />

				Relax guys...I was not exactly being serious about sending a letter to LE. I mentioned the idea of sending a letter to LE as a indicator of how much precaution to take when sending a letter. Let&#039;s say for example, I just wanted to mail someone a strip of acid and wanted to make sure my prints, and any other evidence leading back to me would be removed. Perhaps we can try this again?

				Besides, a good cautious vendor should have the ability to take enough precautions so that one can mail drugs to a DEA agent and still manage to not reveal themselves. Before anyone gets their panties up in a bunch, realize that I was only pointing out a hypothetical situation.

				You&#039;re probably not going to get a whole lot of responses on this subject.&nbsp; The reason is simple: the very forum you are posting in is chock-full of threads on this very subject.&nbsp; You&#039;ve been here for a while, I&#039;m surprised you haven&#039;t already read most of them.
