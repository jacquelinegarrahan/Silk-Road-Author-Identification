				I&#039;m guessing you got them finally? <br /><br />Otherwise, how long has it been? <br /><br />I&#039;ve waited many times 3-4 hours. Other unusual times 12 hours, but that was a widespread problem at the time. <br /><br />Oh well, hope your à¸¿TC arrived! Please update!

				2-6 hours usually. Every time i send funds to my account, its seems really weird<br />&nbsp;like my coins are gonna get lost in the system or something. But they always come through.

				Go to blockchain.info ***clearnet warning*** and type in your wallet address into the text box near the lower right of the screen. That should give you an idea if the transaction has been started or not. Then once you see a wallet address with an arrow directed towards your wallet address and you have 6 confirmations it should show in your wallet. If you have any questions just PM me.

				I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on its been 2 days. I never received shit and the support teams for SR can&#039;t help Nd neither can instant. It&#039;s fucked up because I did everything right. I put in my exact BTC account # for SR. Now I am out of 273 bucks which is a lot of fuckin money for me.

				All bitcoin transactions are publically available.<br />You can go and inspect the bitcoin transaction you made two days go.<br /><br />put your bitcoin address .. (from coinapult) <br />into either of the websites shown below and you&#039;ll be able to &#039;see&#039; the transaction.<br /><br />This is how to do it:<br /><br />let&#039;s say your bitcoin address at coinapult is: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />hit blockchain.info&nbsp; or&nbsp; &nbsp;blockexplorer.com with either of these URLs<br /><br />https://blockexplorer.com/address/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />or<br /><br />https://blockchain.info/address/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br /><br />It&#039;s that simple.<br /><br />Best wishes :-)<br />

				I entered my BTC address In blockchain and the transaction is not there, as if it never happened. I&#039;m so pissed. Their technical team on Coinapult is looking into it.

				something like this happened before.<br />In that case.. person X.. says.. i transfered Y bitcoins to Z.<br />In the end.. it turned out that the transfer request is only activated when you <br />click a link in an email.. sent to you after you press the &#039;withdraw&#039; button.<br /><br />Person X didn&#039;t read the details in the &#039;withdraw&#039; page.<br /><br />I wonder if a similar, simple error will be the solution to this mystery too. <br />Let&#039;s hope so :-)<br />
