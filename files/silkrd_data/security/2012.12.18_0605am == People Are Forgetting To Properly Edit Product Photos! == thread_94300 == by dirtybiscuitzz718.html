				This is just a reminder to any vendors, when posting pics of your product be sure to look it over real good when you think youve edited it properly. I just seen a listing ( I will keep this anonymous), for a prescription substance, the photo was taken of the bottle with the lable &quot;edited&quot;. The name and addy and all the basic stuff was sensored, but what this particular vendor forgot is that those random numbers on RX labels all mean something.<br /><br />&nbsp;I was able to pull up a map with a pin point location of the pharmacy that dispensed this stuff. This can be incriminating on so many levels, and its not the first time ive seen this happen, so I just wanted to speak up and remind every one, be diligent in your efforts to remain anonymous. Ive sent this particular vendor a PM informing him/her of the error. Please if any one happens to notice little slips like this, lend a hand and kindly PM them. <br /><br />&nbsp;We have to work together to keep this community as tightly knit as it possibly can be, with the huge influx of new members and all. Much love every one!
