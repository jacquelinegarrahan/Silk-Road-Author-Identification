				I&#039;ve been dreaming up this contraption for quite some time.&nbsp; Essentially it is a box it might be in the attic or cut out of the foundation or whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s about 2x2x2 feet or bigger if you need it to be.&nbsp; In each wall there is a large amount of I guess for lack of a better word blow torches but obviously modified.&nbsp; Then some kid of ventilation.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go into much more detail to bore you but the general idea is you have a bracelet or a ring or something or the sorts with a button on it and when its pressed say in a certain rhythm or whatever all the torches kick on.&nbsp; Instantly melting anything inside to shit.<br /><br />Obviously it needs a bit of work and some research ect. but I think its a decent idea.

				I wouldn&#039;t exactly call it a pipe dream.<br />Rigging up a burn box with a detonator and thermite wouldn&#039;t really take all that much effort and would be extremely effective<br />though the attic might be a little over the top :]

				I&#039;d get a metal barrel, rig it up with an igniter and some flammable fluids (denatured alcohol in plastic bottles) and keep the stash in it.<br />The igniter can be triggered by house&#039;s alarm system.<br />And/or wiht a homem ade alarm system: if the latch is in a closed position (so the lock is locked) but the door itself is open (the door has no contact with the door frame) the igniter gets triggered. So when do door is bashed open but the lock is still&nbsp; locked the barrel goes up into flames.<br /><br />Falselarm = you loose all your gear<br /><br />A phone can be rigged to the igniter as well, you give it a call it goes up in flames.<br />Someone accidentally calls a wrong number that happens to be your phone = lost all your gear.<br />Having something flammable above or around the barrel = you loose your house<br /><br />Using explosives or torching up the whole room or house willingly in case of a break in, potentially harming officers = more time in jail.
