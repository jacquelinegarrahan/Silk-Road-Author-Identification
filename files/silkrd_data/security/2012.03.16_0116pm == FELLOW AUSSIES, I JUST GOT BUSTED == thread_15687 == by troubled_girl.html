				Hi<br /><br />Im writing this, i shit you not, moments after 4 cops with guns knocked on my door with a warrant and tore my place to shreds! yep, 930 friday night! i thought I was extremely lucky that without any prior history, they just made me attend a drug program. I was on the borderline with amounts, they said.<br /><br />I was getting quite complacent and ordering regularly. almost weekly from numerous countries.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever had 3 seizures. 1 from US - .4g of C around xmas from a normally outstanding vendor.<br /><br />2 from holland, and i think this is what set them off, MDMA from the netherlands from 1 vendor.<br /><br />1 more other from NL made it thru before i stopped ordering from there. 3 in all from NL. no other high risk countries<br /><br /><br />a month or so passed...<br /><br /><br /><br />In 1 week from SR w/e sale, i had 5 items from 3 different countries from 5 different vendors, all under different names to my address.<br /><br />inclusive of the 1 that made it thru from holland.<br /><br />In order to distinguish vendors and reduce risk of seizures, I ordered things all under different names, thinking im smart<br /><br /><br /><br />beware. If u were like and thought it couldnt happen to you, well it sure as hell can.<br /><br />dont become complacent like me and learn your lesson.<br /><br />surprisingly, there was no police dog. but they were extremely thorough.... they didnt need a dog. they opened every nook and cranny.... they clearly knew i had something. <br /><br />all i had left thank god was just under 2g&#039;s MDMA, 4 acid trips, &lt; .2 ket &amp; 1 viagra...<br /><br />i shat myself as i saw any future prospect of a decent job, having a possible crim record and not being able to travel freely to countries etc etc hang in the balance before my very eyes.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Who know what tipped them off?<br /><br />was it the seizures from NL? was it the ever 5 different names to the same address? was it a dispute with an asshole vendor who alerted the authorities cos of minor disputes? Was it my neighbors seeing me act erratically and dob me in?<br /><br />who knows..... but be vigilant. be careful. do whatever it takes that u can think of and dont let ur guard down.<br /><br />honestly, when they rocked up i thought they were kids trick or treating! its not frikkin halloween.<br /><br />but they knew. so watch your back. cos here&#039;s me thinking i should be stockpiling just in case something happens to SR! I would dread to think what would&#039;ve happened....<br /><br />Cos it can happen to you. &amp; if you are not careful, or if you do it long enough, it well may!....<br /><br />not that i would wish it upon anyone<br />

				IMHO, it is very foolish to use a fake name when sending stuff to your house. Especially multiple fake names! I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s what did you in, but it&#039;s not something I would recommend doing. Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but that&#039;s the way I feel about it.

				Hmmmm.....maybe read the security threads a bit more my friend. ONE seizure of drugs would put me off using that address again, let alone three. <br /><br />Let&#039;s hope that you learn a lesson from this and wise up a bit before you start trafficking drugs again (because that is what we are doing on here).

Girls do order Viagra, but that, combined with the fact that she ordered hard drugs to one of the most smuggling-unfriendly countries in the world from nations equally infamous for sending the very contraband they look for in Australia, and then kept doing it after her packages were seized numerous times, is more than a little suspicious. Even if this story is completely true, it does not exemplify the &quot;typical SR experience&quot; and should only make you nervous if you live in Australia and order shit over and over again despite it getting seized and your address obviously being flagged.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the laws over there, but if AUS is so keen on cracking down on drugs in the mail, why do they let people off so easily? If this really happened exactly as you wrote it, then you&#039;re a very lucky troubled girl.

				Sounds like bullshit to me to. Really, If the police searched your home and found contraband&nbsp; for whatever reason you would have been charged or cautioned if it was a small amount. They don&#039;t tell you go to drug rehab, only a court might impose this on you.<br /><br />To all these people that say an address gets &#039;flagged&#039; in reality if customs was to scan every address of every letter coming into the country and then cross mach it against a database to see if its &#039;flagged&#039; mail would take months to get in. If you watch border security this definitely is not happening in our mail centers. Yeah theymay pull some mail aside using profiling techniques, some gets xrayed and some have the dogs go over it, but that would be the extent of it.

I know people in Australia who have been raided and ended up going to court ordered treatment and paying fines etc, but they of course had to go to court and be sentenced first. Moral of the story is that this story could indeed happen and has happened to other people, but probably didn&#039;t happen to the OP cuz that isn&#039;t how the injustice system works.

				yeah sorry im not paying it either.<br />You would definitely front court over those amounts + fines even for a first time offense.<br />unless you flipped :o<br /><br />edit- &quot;trafficable&quot; quantities of MDMA range from 0.5 - 3g depending on the state.

				Even if it is true and people are starting to get worried, there are ways you can get around ordering to your HOME address. I think people need to start thinking outside the box. I never order to my own address and I never use my real name, I&#039;ve received 8+ order from countries including India, Thailand and EU countries. In the case customs do intercept my package, they have no way of tracing it back to my house. If you are ordering to your home address, I&#039;d look up your states trafficking laws and always order under the stated amount. Of course if your only doing a few orders then maybe it&#039;s worth the risk but if your gonna order regularly, be safe and be smart.

				Holland, England Belgium and no other country has anything to do with that. Do you know how much/many is send specially with E-bay and other internet purchases a day????. I am sure your address was already under suspicion -maybe- because of all the fake names (read people) living there.<br />To stay under the radar you have to be as normal as possible. Just order (ask the seller) movie or music CD&#039;s.<br />Make sure its labelled with a good PRINTED label (not something scribbled on the envelop) and always enough postage, better one to many then short (thats how I do it anyway)<br />If anyone has a better idea....I&#039;m always open for improvement ;)<br />Cheers,<br />J<br />&nbsp;

				Yes, presented Warrant, much to my horror.<br /><br />I tired stalling the cunts every which way, to no avail<br /><br />I thought that as well, but I do recall someone saying maaaaaaaaaaany moons ago on forums that sometimes the allow items through and a while, so they can build a solid case against you. <br /><br />It could well have been a local calling, but then, y wouldnt plain clothes cops pop round when u r high and bust u acting erratically?&nbsp; as I have on occasion, but nothing that would draw attention to me. just random in my own backyard, which is secure view wise etc.<br /><br />they were from local Drug Tactical.<br /><br />no badges. 2 x stock standard commodors.<br /><br />Im sure i couldve handled it better so much in hindsight, but its quite intimidating when u have 4 cops on a fri night catchin u off guard.<br />especially if you havent had much to do with the law...<br /><br />Paranoid about own personal security = excellent.<br /><br />paranoid about posting with this detail.... and being hostile about it = retarded = FU!

				Fucktards hmmmmm a little bit personal, and really defensive!<br /><br />Well let&#039;s for a second, give you the benifit of the doubt. Can you answer three questions, and no Google wont help you!.<br /><br />What is the colour of the warrant they gave you?<br /><br />How many times did you need to sign it?<br /><br />What was issued to you when they came to the conclusion it will be a drug diversion situation?<br /><br />Pretty straight forward questions, and you should have no problem knowing these answers. I will publicly apologise if you answer correctly.<br /><br />How do I know, well I have &quot;fractured&quot; a few laws in my time.&nbsp; ;)

People asked you to clarify and in the time it has taken you to respond, more and more comments we&#039;re made. If you&#039;re trying to be informative, the forum appreciates that, but please understand, the anonymity afforded to members lends itself to having, as you so eloquently phrased, &quot;fucktards&quot; spreading nonsense. So don&#039;t get sand in your privates when people ask for what you didn&#039;t, but probably should have provided.<br /><br />I admit I called &quot;shenannigans&quot;, however after your clarification, I&#039;m prepared to retract that statement :-X.

It does not make sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />Inter-department cooperation, a warrant, four cops at 9:30pm on a Friday night for a caution/diversion is a massive waste of resources - especially with no media release and therefore no deterrent.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t think that Customs/AFP are that worried about SR and I don&#039;t think they were onto you despite your questionable methods. <br /><br />More likely you pissed someone off&nbsp; IRL or sold some gear that you ordered and it somehow the cops got word.

				So you got busted with a relatively small amount of drugs which Customs let through and didn&#039;t watch and then at some time later sent 4 cops around with no dog to find that relatively small amount of drugs.<br /><br />The drugs you could have done anything with in the meantime because they weren&#039;t watching you? <br /><br />And you can&#039;t see why some are suspicious?<br /><br />Customs don&#039;t let stuff through without controlling it. For a start they&#039;ll swap the gear for fake stuff. Then they&#039;ll bust you when you get it. And I&#039;ll admit, but I&#039;m assuming its for larger quantities.<br /><br />So, if you indeed get done, perhaps someone at the post reported the address after 3 got stopped? Given you used lots of names, what name/s were on the warrant?<br /><br />4 cops, Friday night and you get a diversion? I know people at festivals with less who haven&#039;t been so lucky.&nbsp; Just doesn&#039;t add up even a little for me. But not sure why you&#039;d troll here of all places? <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, paranoid is good. Thinking could happen to anyone anytime is good. Ask any cop (I have) and they can spend months watching someone. It&#039;s the stupid, sloppy things that bust them. Or random luck.<br />

				I was skeptical of the OP until I received a letter from a respected overseas vendor (not going to mention any names or packaging techniques so don&#039;t ask). It had orange tape around it saying it had been opened fro inspection...<br /><br />Leaflet inside said...<br />Open for inspection - international mail<br /><br />This mail has been opened by Australia Post for inspection by AQIS. The AQIS screening process, which uses detector dogs and x-ray machines detected there may be an item of quarantine concern in you mail.. blah balah blah..<br />No items have been removed by AQIS...<br /><br />Fuck me they missed it, still got the goods but got one fucking huge scare at the same time..<br /><br />Bottom line 99% of vendors with less stealthy packaging would have been picked up for sure...

				Simple is good.<br /><br />Fake names, PO boxes, vacant properties etc etc just add too much complexity and increase the possibility of a fuck up. And when that fuck up comes your deniability is out the window if you have been doing any of the above.<br /><br />Likewise signing for things. If the postie comes with a package in my name I sign for it, take it in and open it. Even if you are not expecting something you would legitimately want to know what you have been sent, I do not think it is logical that you would just write RTS on it and leave it out. Surely that would be a reasonable defence?

In the<br />discussion of trace and bulk detection technologies, general background information is given to<br />define terms and discuss problems. For individual technology-based detection techniques, there<br />is, in most cases, a brief technical discussion of how the technique works.<br /><br />2.2 Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS)<br /><br />Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is one of the most widely used techniques for the trace<br />detection of illicit drugs and other contraband materials. The principle of operation of an ion<br />mobility spectrometer (also called an IMS) is shown in figure 2.<br /><br />2.3 Field Ion Spectrometry (FIS)<br /><br />Field ion spectrometry (FIS) is a relatively new trace detection technology (less than 10 years<br />old) that is related to ion mobility spectrometry. It incorporates a unique ion filter using dual<br />transverse fields that allow interferences to be eliminated electronically without the use of GC<br />columns, membranes, or other physical separation methods. FIS is similar to IMS in that both<br />involve separating and quantifying ions that are carried in a gas at atmospheric pressure.<br />Furthermore, both systems use soft ionization methods that yield spectra where the species of<br />interest produce the main features, that is, under the proper conditions there is little<br />decomposition of the analyte.<br /><br />2.4 Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensors<br /><br />Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors are usually coupled with a front-end GC. The principal<br />component of a SAW sensor is a piezoelectric crystal that resonates at a specific, measurable<br />frequency. When molecules condense on the surface of this crystal, the resonant frequency shifts<br />in proportion to the mass of material condensed. The frequency shift also depends upon the<br />properties of the material being deposited, the surface temperature, and the chemical nature of<br />the crystal surface.<br /><br />2.5 Mass Spectrometry<br />2.6 Raman Spectroscopy<br />2.7 Mistral Security Drug Detection and Field Identification Kit<br />2.8 Securetec Drugwipes<br />2.9 Gas Chromatography/Surface Ionization Detection<br /><br />4. BULK DETECTION TECHNOLOGIES</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course there are budgetary, bureaucrat, and other factors that determine deployment or lack thereof.&nbsp; While I&#039;m not familiar with law enforcement equipment I&#039;ve seen some of the technology in an industrial application and these techs have developed to incredible effectiveness and efficiency, assuming you didn&#039;t opt for the budget models ;)
