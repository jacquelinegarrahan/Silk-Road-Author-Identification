				So basically i opened up TOR and gone to onto SR and ive been logged into an account (i have screen shots for admins/DPR) fully logged in no pin obviously, no damage done to the account no finalizing orders (i could if i wanted full control, no pin) even tho they had 500 USD in orders, and a tracking number in MESSAGES.<br /><br />Just what the fuck?, i closed tor for a new identity and of course was back to normal but this doesn&#039;t explain this wtf? <br /><br />admin/staff/DPR please contact me <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Well i submitted a message to SR support (TO THIS THREAD) hopefully the owner will confirm it wasn&#039;t him and someone will give a shit?<br /><br /><br />seems like a serious fuck up/glitch/bug to me <br /><br /><br />

				Had you closed the browser? Because I believe although I won&#039;t bet my life on it, but I believe that if you leave firefox open, even though you close tor, the cookie doesn&#039;t get deleted (depending on your cookie settings) and you&#039;re still technically logged into SR. However, if there&#039;s a long delay between SR url accesses, then the login screen does appea, even if you left the browser open.

				Sorry i know your first language may not be english, But could you please try and state what the problem is as clearly as possible.<br />You logged into Sr from tor, and had screenshots of DPR&#039;s account flash on your screen and had full access and control of the account,but you could not do anything as you had no pin? <br />Sorry im not being rude here, Im just trying to work out what you mean Exactly

				I reread OP&#039;s post and now see that he meant he was logged into someone else&#039;s account. I&#039;m sorry I misunderstood. But I don&#039;t get if he meant the SR admin&#039;s (DPR&#039;s?) account.<br /><br />That would be truly unprecedented and scary.

				No, im not new i have been using SR for 2 years have near 100 transactions...<br /><br />and yes i went to go onto SR so opened tor which opens the control panel and an instance of firefox (no there wasn&#039;t one running because i was watching a film and wanted to check an if an order had been shipped).<br />and there is a warning if you try to open another TOR.<br /><br />went to sr home URL and got no login/home page just got logged straight into an account with 500 USD in orders that i could finalize.<br /><br />the owner of the account isnt from my country i don&#039;t know him, hes not a vendor and i have never spoke to him.<br /><br />it&#039;s just a random cookie?/fuckup<br /><br />I sent SR support a few messages, im unsure what more i can do? once the real owner logs in and confirms he didn&#039;t send the messages to silk road actions can be taken?<br /><br /><br />

				Fuck me...<br />This is some serious shit here.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely follow this one. Please keep us updated Cirrus. No need for details, obviously. Just update with some official statement that the origin of the vulnerability was understood and fixed, so this could never happen again.<br /><br />Just imagine the damage if OP was malicious or LE: $ gone and evidence for (intl.?) drug importationS. Game over. <br />I&#039;m not to worried about loosing the few bucks I have in SR, I (almost) always encrypted my drop and I never use tracking, so in my case consequences would have been minimal, but still. This profile was obviously a very active and not too security oriented buyer.<br /><br />Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On a side note, is it really so hard to encrypt those tracking numbers? I wouldn&#039;t want to have my drop out on the open like that.. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193324.msg1394884#msg1394884">Quote from: StExo on July 30, 2013, 09:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think an explanation would not be in order to go public, if it&#039;s an exploitable bug we don&#039;t want to parade around demanding answers, as Cirrus said DPR is looking into it and I imagine they&#039;ll message you in due course shortly.

Sometimes the login session is still live and you won&#039;t have to enter login details (just like many other websites, facebook etc. &quot;keep you logged in&quot; with cookies) Looks like there was just a bug that can caused the person to pickup somebody&#039;s login presumably because of the way TOR by design causes a user to tunnel through the same IP as many other users.

				This reminds me of the times i made an order and it went through twice. So i basically got two items for the price of one, it was only a qp of weed but this happened to me two times. It didn&#039;t bother me much&nbsp; ::). <br /><br />But this is some scary shit, I think it&#039;s best to leave your coins on tails or a paper wallet anyway. Just send your coins to your account when making a purchase.

				If this accidental session hijacking shit happened more than once, then it&#039;s definitely not some miracle of math. Sounds like the hash table ran out of space, or the code itself was flawed enough for session IDs to be reused under a specific set of circumstances. Let&#039;s all be thankful SR requires a PIN before funds can be moved :X.

				DPR said that the probability of this happening was BS to the 26 (10^26). <br /><br />Because a collision happened on this side of the universe, the probability that this is the correct odds for this collision is EXTREMELY SLIM.<br /><br />Just eyeballing it, if 1 BILLION unique sessions were logged in at the silkroad since the update (slightly over-predicting the volume here), the probability of this happening is MUCH MUCH LESS THAN 0.001%!!!!!!!<br /><br />Therefore, I know, with greater than 99.999% confidence, THAT THE ORIGINALLY GIVEN PROBABILITY OF A COLLISION IS BULLSHIT.<br /><br />This is called rejecting the NULL HYPOTHESIS.<br /><br />DPR I really hope you didn&#039;t just &quot;lower the odds&quot; on whatever algorithm you were using and called it a day.<br />There is a deep fundamental flaw in either the login system and/or the algorithm.

				I wonder what someone malicious would actually be capable of doing? Finalizing orders, viewing sensitive messages, sending messages to possibly scam people who trust the authentic account owner, and changing feedback on vendors. Or what if someone got access to a vendors account this way? They would potentially be able to view all of the messages on the account, some which may contain addresses and such. I don&#039;t have a vendors account so I don&#039;t know what else but I imagine they could cancel orders, message customers and somehow scam them offsite, or whatever else would be possible had this happened on a vendors account. It worries me that nobody has addressed this yet. Is SR safe to use right now?

				Although with tormail being history, Im guessing a lot of the &quot;off site&quot; deals and such have stopped or reduced greatly. And let&#039;s not fool ourselves into thinking it wasn&#039;t happening.. that shit WAS happening. Unless the off-site-dealing went to like gmail etc, which then.. well.. no comment!<br /><br />

Its making me wonder how safe SR really is in regards to its own infrastructure. I imagine someone who is a little more gifted with computers could do a lot of harm with this than the people who are stumbling across this appalling security flaw. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201476.0<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kahg4/logged_in_to_another_users_account/<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Without knowing the specifics of what is happening, it&#039;s hard to gauge how easy it is for someone to deliberately use this exploit to access someone&#039;s account or whether they just have to wait till their session collides with another session. As a general rule with computing if something can happen accidentally by someone not doing anything explicit, then it can be re-performed by a more tech savvy malicious user. It would be hard to imagine a malicious user would be able to target a specific account, rather just waiting till a session id matches a current open session id. You can be pretty sure it&#039;s happened to more than the two people who have reported it so hopefully DPR is onto it.<br /><br />Just another reason for people to become properly familiarized with silk road and how to use it properly and securely -i.e. learn pgp to send any sensitive data and make sure you have a pin (i&#039;m pretty sure the latter is compulsory, i have had one for as long as i can remember).

				Cirrus PMed me to say that DPR has looked into it and the problem has been resolved as of today.<br /><br />Personally, I have my doubts, but we&#039;ll see.
