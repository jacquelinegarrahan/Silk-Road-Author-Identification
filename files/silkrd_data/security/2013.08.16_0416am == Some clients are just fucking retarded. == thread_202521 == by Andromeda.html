				Couldn&#039;t you have just canceled his order/refused to sell to him? At least your stats wouldn&#039;t have taken a hit.

				Why would you put NOT ILLEGAL NARCOTICS on a package with illegal drugs in it? <br />Granted he is an idiot but you as a vendor should have high standards to not to sink as low as putting ones freedom at risk intentionally. <br />This isn&#039;t a video game, there are no do overs. This is a persons life/freedom you put at risk.<br />As said above, you could just not of dealt with the idiot.<br />Not cool man, not cool.<br />Also. Did you even send him the product he ordered? If so, was it the right amount?

				Yeah, there&#039;s just something wrong about sending a letter to someone and flagging it for the authorities, just because the guy is stupid.<br />I would just cancel the order, and tell him to get his shit straight.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck feeding people to the wolves.

				Didn&#039;t Bruce just his vendor account over suggesting as a joke that they might mail dogshit to someone. Vendors need to keep a level of professionalism regardless of how retarded buyers might get. If a buyer is submitting information wrong, or contacting you to ask for freebies or whatever, its the vendors responsibility to delete any sensitive information and either let the buyer know how to fix it, or tell them not to order from you anymore. <br /><br />Yes, some people are idiots, but you bring yourself even lower when you pull shenanigans like this. Just cancel the order next time and move on. Its not worth the trouble and you only end up hurting yourself on the feedback (or like in Bruce&#039;s case you might loose your vendor account and bond).

				#1 You just betrayed your stealth methods and could put real customers of yours at risk. (assuming it was wrapped in the same way)<br />#2 As a vendor you can refuse to service customers for any reason by cancelling their order.<br />#3 You intentionally did something that you knew would tarnish your rep... why?<br />#4 Waste of droogz.<br />You came on the forum to flame the buyer, yet your actions (through your own decisions) only hurt yourself. I am not sure if you are under the impression that you have to take every order that is placed but in fact you do not. The buyer may have merely been a competing vendor purposely trying to tarnish your stats (does happen) Regardless, your actions were equally dumb as the buyer.

				Not only do I usually send more than people purchase (If you purchase one unit, i&#039;ll probably send 3 or 4)<br /><br />His address was not real and did not even match the country he provided.<br /><br />I canceled his order twice, he ordered a third time.<br /><br />Also I did&nbsp; not right &quot;No illegal drugs&quot; on the package, i just thought it would be funny if i had. Meant to mention that but forgot.<br /><br />Last I checked, mailing someone caffine won&#039;t put their freedom at risk.

				It also seems like common sense that if you are going to share a story like this that you get the fucking details right the first time you tell it and not try and cover your tracks.
