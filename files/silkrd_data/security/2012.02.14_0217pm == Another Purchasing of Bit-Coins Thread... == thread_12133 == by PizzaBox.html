				Hi. I&#039;m new here and obviously looking to make a purchase requiring Bit-Coins.<br /><br /><br />I have been doing some research and reading up on some of the previous threads on these boards.<br /><br />My understanding so far is that one needs to purchase their Bit-Coins, and then &#039; anonymize &#039; them by &#039; tumbling &#039; or sending the Bit-Coins to fresh e-wallets not linked to the original purchase. <br /><br />i.e. Purchase at Mt.Gox (NOT USING TOR), --&gt; then sending to some kind of e-wallet(s) (USING TOR) , --&gt; then onto a mixing facility (USING TOR) , and from there ---&gt; SR.<br /><br /><br />But ontop of having my logic confirmed or corrected by people in the know, i also have a few questions to ask:<br /><br />1a) I found this site on one vendors information page. Has anyone used this website before for buying Bit-Coins?&nbsp; &nbsp; https:// wm-center . com/ buy/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(remove spaces) <br />1b) Would i be able to by-pass the need for using Mt.Gox, by going through this website with a direct cash transfer from a company like Western Union/Moneygram?? <br />1c) Does anyone know if this &#039; wm-centre &#039; site is trustworthy and legitimate?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2. I have heard of the mention of a combination of both e-wallets and mixing pool facilities used in the anonymizing process. some places i have heard mentioned in my research were - Instawallet as an e-wallet, desktop e-wallets and Bit-Coin Frog as a mixing pool facility. <br /><br />2a) Can someone please recommend some e-wallet sites i could use to insulate my original transfers from?? i.e. one Instawallet, one desktop wallet, and then onto a Bit-Coin Frog account accessed through Tor?<br />2b) does this overall plan sound satisfactory?? Mt Gox OR https://wm-center.com/buy/ (not using tor, using real info) ---&gt;&gt; insta-wallet/desktop e-wallet (not using tor, using fake info) ---&gt;&gt; Bit-Coin Frog (using tor, and fake info) ---&gt;&gt; SR?<br />2c) how long would the Bit-Coins need to be left in the mixing pool service before they would be &#039; cleaned &#039; ??<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />so Thank You for following my train of thought and taking the time to read my post and reply. i hope it all made sense and was not confusing. i am sorry if i am being overly pedantic, but given the risks...i just want to be assured that i am doing things correctly here, and am not exposing myself to any un-necessary liability, and am not going to lose my money.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br />Regards, <br /><br />Pizzabox<br />

				Send them to 1BxG3YnDqT4AeBRjq9ZTdFxyzSNemdKdMU then log in at g66jkiuo884h6987.onion, they will tumble them for free in three hours<br /><br />&nbsp; 8)

				That sounds pretty scammy.&nbsp; LOL<br />SR has a pretty good tumbler system built-in.&nbsp; Most people just use an e-wallet as a go-between when they transfer from their exchange to SR.&nbsp; I use different accounts at the exchange for every transaction, use cash to get it there to begin with, and trust the SR tumbler to a certain extent.

				but what are some good and trustwrothy &#039;e-wallets&#039; ? are places like insta-wallet and bluecoin frog acceptable??<br /><br /><br />also, once one transfers to an e-wallet, should this e-wallet be setup with fake info and accessed via tor to break the links back to myself?<br /><br />or should i just send on to an e-wallet with fake info , but accessed via the normal internet??
