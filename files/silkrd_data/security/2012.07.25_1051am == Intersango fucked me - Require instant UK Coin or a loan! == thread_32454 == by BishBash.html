				Hey,<br />Yeah, I sent cash to Intersango, turns out I&#039;m not gonna see that money for a while.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2012-07-24 18:51 BST<br /><br />While we were previously under the impression that the problems we were having with Metro bank were due to a technical issue on their end (as this has happened before), we have been told that our account activity is being reviewed and that we must be patient during this process. We have faith that our contact at Metro bank will properly investigate the matter. They have indicated that they do not require information from us at this time. The resolution time we were given was around 1 week, however this is just an approximation.<br /><br />We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused our userbase. We are doing everything we can to resolve the problem as fast as possible. In the future, we may not be able to accept payments quite as fast anymore to prevent fraud however we will work hard to decrease our resolution times for issues and make the experience of purchasing and selling bitcoins as easy for the UK as possible.<br /><br />We understand that many people have called Metro bank and Metro has told them that there is no issue. This is entirely incorrect. We believe it in not intentional it is simply that their support staff assumes that if there is not an issue affecting all accounts or a huge number of accounts at the bank that there is not an issue with our account.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Fuck.<br /><br />So yeah, UK people - DON&#039;T DEPOSIT THERE, unless you want to lose the funds for &quot;approximately 7 days&quot; whilst they sort their crap. But I get the vibe that they seem quite unsure on the timeframe from that quote too.<br /><br />Does anybody know either:<br />a) Somewhere I can get instant BTC for GBP, or<br />b) Somebody willing to loan me 4.20 BTC (lucky number ;) ) and receive 5 BTC within 7 days! <br /><br />Wanting to get an order in very soon (preferably even within the next couple hours). I&#039;m quite doubtful either A or B exist, but if so that&#039;d be a godsend. It&#039;s such a stupid little amount of Coin...<br /><br />Cheers!<br />And UK users - Take heed this warning, don&#039;t make the same mistake I did and deposit and end up out of pocket -.-<br />

				generally emailing their customer support with all your bank details and having a damn good moan usually works. but if metro is under investigation for fraudulent reasons (within intersango&#039;s account) then its a damn good pre-warning for us UK users to do more Bitcoin wallet laundering.

				they have had a few different banks and the uk gov wouldnt dare do shit to lloyds or big banks so maybe told them to ban intersango but they will punish a small bank like metro

It takes a few seconds to send them your passport and a utility bill and they approve it within a few hours.<br /><br />You can do IBAN, Swift or BIC transfers with them to and from your UK bank account which takes about 1 working day, same as Intersango.<br /><br />I also highly recommend vlad1m1r and his services. I have done business with him recently and he an excellent person. Much faster than Intersangshit. I used to love Intersango, used to recommend them to everyone, now they are a joke. Even when they do work you have to moan to get every little thing done.

				A few years from now I&#039;m going to open my own Caribbean themed coffee bar where patrons will be able to buy Bitcoins over the counter for cash and also pay for drinks contained inside coconuts and mini fluorescent umbrellas with their own Bitcoins.<br /><br />In the mean time there is my cash in the mail service which will allow you to buy Bitcoins safely and reliably with a short turnaround time (2-3 working days from the time you send the cash to the time you actually receive your coins).<br /><br />Please feel free to visit my listing on SR if you want further details:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/57b32a1924<br /><br />V.
