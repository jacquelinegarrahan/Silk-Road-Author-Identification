				Hello SR<br /><br />I set up a tormail email account and it looks like I cant start using it until I configure it with Mozilla Thunderbird?<br /><br />I have attempted to do this with the manual instructions tormail give in their help section but when I do I keep getting a message saying Thunderbird can not connect to server, this is the message &#039;&#039;sorry we are unable to connect with our sign up server please check your connection&#039;&#039;.<br /><br />I have 2 questions..........<br /><br />1) Do I need to even set up tormail this way if not is there another way to start using it?<br /><br />2) If I do need to set up tormail using Mozilla Thunderbird any advice on how to connect to the server would be much appreciated?<br /><br />Can you answers these questions in user friendly speak please.<br /><br />Many thanks :-)

				There&#039;s no need to use thunderbird unless you want to access tormail messages without going to the tormail site. <br /><br />Did you choose squirellmail when you signed up? That&#039;s the best way, it doesn&#039;t require javascript. Then all you do to check your email is go to http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/squirrelmail/, log in and voila. Why complicate matters? If you didn&#039;t set up using squirellmail, I suggest you go to&nbsp; http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion and register again using a different tormail address.<br /><br />goblin

				Err, since when do you choose at the time you create the account...?&nbsp; wtf... the last time I used the site, I chose every time I tried to check my mail.&nbsp; I always chose squirrelmail, but I didn&#039;t even think there was an option to choose when you set up an address?&nbsp; &nbsp;???

Since I saw the choice between roundcube, with javascript, and squirellmail, without, I thought you had to choose one right after registering, and then you were stuck with it. If I&#039;m wrong, I am sorry.<br /><br />The other option is for the control panel and I never use that.<br /><br />

				I got it now. Even if you choose one or the other at signup, it&#039;s not a permanent choice, you can swing back and forth between roundcube and squirellmail, no problemo.<br /><br />

				I wasn&#039;t trying to call you on some bullshit or something, it just weirds me out a little that I don&#039;t even remember being *able* to choose a default option, let alone not choosing every time I logged in.&nbsp; Sort of weirds me out that we&#039;re talking about two different sites or something, that&#039;s all.

				this is probably a really stupid question but can someone provide me the link to this tormail site? im having issues finding it even after using the search option on here. is it affiliated with SR or is it just an encryption type of email that is much more secure than hush/safemail?

				If you go to tormail.org, it&#039;ll give you the actual onion address, I always have to do that to find it.<br /><br />Here it is: http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/<br /><br />And that will only work from within a torbrowser session of course.<br /><br />
