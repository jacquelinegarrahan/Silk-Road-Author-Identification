				yeah that&#039;s about it.&nbsp; It was the mail intercepts coupled with the guy&#039;s woman rolling over on him that really did it though... but the email login is what started the whole ball rolling (many months before the actual bust, I might add).<br /><br />Interestingly, they couldn&#039;t and didn&#039;t even touch him over any of the internet stuff, because even they admitted Tor is virtually impossible to prosecute and prove guilt when it&#039;s involved.&nbsp; They got him on receiving, manufacturing, selling/distribution, and shipping out, but nothing to do with the internet.

				Maybe I&#039;m missing something here, but that doesn&#039;t seem to make sense.<br /><br />I mean, how was the OVDB session IDed?<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t you have to break into OVDB server (which I don&#039;t think happened), have logs of IP addresses that connected and a timestamp, and then compare the same with all the popular email companies, gmail/hotmail et al?<br /><br />

				It wasn&#039;t an ovdb session that was logged, it was a clear-net forum he was on if I remember correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to go back and re-read all of the case notes because it&#039;s pretty hazy now and this was about 4-5 months ago I was reading all of this stuff.<br /><br />It was real life logistical and personal issues that got him nailed in the end, not his online operations.&nbsp; Sellers need to remember to keep up brick and mortar security tight as hell, because that&#039;s where they are going to get you.&nbsp; Even a few of the sellers that got taken down on here in the early days were the result of stupidity in the real world, and nothing to do with SR.

				Dont use clearnet with TOR for any private things, especcialy not logins.

				I can&#039;t find the link to the Tails site that referenced a very similar vulnerability, but, from memory, here&#039;s the summary of what was written: If you have multiple tabs open in your browser and are using an exit node that&#039;s being monitored, then the sites you are accessing can be used to correlate who you are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s say you have your Intersango.com account open in one tab &amp; open another tab to check your email.&nbsp; Then a correlation can be made between the name on the email account &amp; the Intersango.com connection.&nbsp; So, even if you used a fake name on your Intersango account &amp; only accessed that account via Tor, the people doing the monitoring can guess who actually owns that Intersango account.&nbsp; <br /><br />From what I remember from this Tails document, the suggestion was made to actually close your browser entirely before going to another site, just to be safe.&nbsp;

				The solution seems easy enough - if you&#039;re going to access two websites with accounts that you don&#039;t want to be associated to each other (let&#039;s say Intersango and e-mail), just access intersango in your regular browser and your e-mail in another browser that sin&#039;t routing its traffic through Tor.

So for a 10 minute window, you could be on a website anonymously in one tab, but if you open another tab and login to your clearweb email out of habit, then if the exit node is compromised/unfriendly they could now match a timestamp + IP address (anonymous) to an identical timestamp + IP address with you clearnet email login (not anonymous). The equivalence relationship implies it&#039;s the same person.<br /><br />In practice, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anything like this straightforward though. I think there&#039;s mixing services and stuff or something.<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp; Or is going to your tormail and SR in the same browser in some way compromising your security?<br /><br />No. But if you are using your real identity e.g. name, address etc in your TORmail, then Yes. (assuming TORmail is itself compromised)<br /><br />&gt; Also, using an everyday browser and apps like bittorent without tor connections, while also at the same time browsing SR on tor is still perfectly safe, correct?<br /><br />Yes I think so. It&#039;s that BitTorrent traffic is high volume in comparison to hidden service traffic and really stands out in traffic analysis, which is why it&#039;s never advisable to use TOR with the BitTorrent protocol and better to use it on clearnet.<br /><br />Anybody disagree, CapSensible?

				Pine, my understanding is that a malicious Tor exit node can decode the traffic sent between the server and the client. However, because there are so many hops between the client and the server, it&#039;s extremely difficult to trace it back to the original IP. It&#039;s possible, but it&#039;s very sophisticated.

				@Spedly - from what I&#039;ve read you are correct.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge in studying illicits charges for internet activity, there has never actually been a successful prosecution of anything regarding Tor itself (backtracing IP, etc.), only stupid mistakes like logging onto a personal email that is usually accessed with your regular IP on clearnet.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think any prosecutor on earth would be crazy enough to try to push an actual Tor case through court, especially for a jury trial.&nbsp; I would love to see it attempted, if only for the lulz... ;)

So for a 10 minute window, you could be on a website anonymously in one tab, but if you open another tab and login to your clearweb email out of habit, then if the exit node is compromised/unfriendly they could now match a timestamp + IP address (anonymous) to an identical timestamp + IP address with you clearnet email login (not anonymous). The equivalence relationship implies it&#039;s the same person.<br /><br />In practice, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anything like this straightforward though. I think there&#039;s mixing services and stuff or something.<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp; Or is going to your tormail and SR in the same browser in some way compromising your security?<br /><br />No. But if you are using your real identity e.g. name, address etc in your TORmail, then Yes. (assuming TORmail is itself compromised)<br /><br />&gt; Also, using an everyday browser and apps like bittorent without tor connections, while also at the same time browsing SR on tor is still perfectly safe, correct?<br /><br />Yes I think so. It&#039;s that BitTorrent traffic is high volume in comparison to hidden service traffic and really stands out in traffic analysis, which is why it&#039;s never advisable to use TOR with the BitTorrent protocol and better to use it on clearnet.<br /><br />Anybody disagree, CapSensible?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Got it. I guess i had been operating under these assumptions but only in the hope really that this was true. In retrospect I, or all of us rather, should have made a list of all the things we were unsure of as a noob and searched/posted them all out before setting off but hey, that&#039;s the crazy, exciting prospect of the capacity of being a member at silk road for ya.<br /><br />Cheers pine- again actually. :) Wish i could grab a cup of coffee with some of you guys and pick your brains.

If you are browsing two sites via the same circuit via the same exit node, it can determine the same person is visiting both of those sites. If one of those sites is your personal facebook you are fucked. Here read this:<br /><br />www.mpi-sws.org/~stevens/pubs/leet11.pdf<br /><br />They deanonymize P2P users via the DHT and then they also determine all of their non P2P traffic going down the same circuit by linking it together at the malicious exit node. They deanonymized 10,000 Tor circuits this way, including *everything* being loaded through the circuits not just the P2P traffic.

				My understanding of .onions is that they act like their own exit node to the .onions server and the traffic never leaves the Tor network. Is it still possible to link .onion traffic and clearnet traffic together if used alongside each other?
