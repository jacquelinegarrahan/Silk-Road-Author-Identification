				I use spendbitcoins.com.au. Really simple, takes about 20 seconds to make an order. You are given their BSB, account number and the deposit number. You take that info to a bank with the cash. The bank will ask for a name and contact number, but it can be fake. I can make an order at 4:45pm on a Monday night and have it in my SR account by 9pm the same day.

				Hi Space,<br /><br />Too easy!<br />Deposited in commonwealth at about 10:30 am and received in SR wallet by 1:30!<br /><br />Must say I was a bit sceptical about this whole bitcoin / SR deal, but willing to risk $50 to see how it goes.....hoping my order will arrive now ;-)<br /><br />Good luck,<br />Kneotac

				I&nbsp; too have used spendbitcoins.com and will be using it again for sure. Very simple and smooth and I&#039;ve found the owner to be incredibly fast with communication. Definitely has my recommendation.
