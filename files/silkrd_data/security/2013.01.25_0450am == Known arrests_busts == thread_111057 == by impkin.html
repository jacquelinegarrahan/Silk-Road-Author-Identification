				Maybe this thread already exists, but would like to suggest there be a sticky that details any *known* arrests/busts of SR users and some analysis of what went wrong. It would serve two purposes, a) to educate users to not make the same mistakes, and b) encourage people to stay vigilant by reminding what&#039;s at stake. Nothing like a neighbor&#039;s house fire to remind you to change the batteries in the smoke alarm.<br /><br />

				I &#039; ve read 2 stories on the forums but I don&#039;t remember their vendor names, both of them caught from IRL dealing or neighbors noticing weird activity etc. I don&#039;t think LE even knew they were vendors here, they would probably make a big deal out of it on the news.<br />

				I&#039;ve seen around 10-12 people busted since I&#039;ve been here.&nbsp; Not one of them were busted for anything to do w/ SR.&nbsp; They all made stupid mistakes.&nbsp; Mistakes like living with your parents and having drugs shipped to their home, dealing out of their home while manufacturing substances, selling using western union and moneypack, real life dealing in general, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve yet to see a single vendor get arrested that simply followed the rules.&nbsp; Similarly, I can&#039;t think of a buyer being busted that followed the rules either.&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of love letters.&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of knock and talks (which aren&#039;t talked about much here), but no real arrests.&nbsp; I see what I consider shill accounts talking about being arrested all the time, but don&#039;t put much credence to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I saw some of the same threads. Even the one I got a letter story sounded fictional.<br /><br />The idea of a busted thread sounds good but I think it would be abused by people who want to get people scared and paranoid just for kicks. <br /><br />They do have good topics on what to do and more importantly what not to do. That could be a little better organized. Some of the info is&nbsp; contradictory but are good rules to follow. <br /><br />With weapons, explosives, kid porn etc I don&#039;t see personal use sales being a huge priority even if a package were to be intercepted. <br /><br />Have fun, follow the rules and be safe. <br /><br />

				Even so - his bust had nothing to do w/ SR.&nbsp; Like you said, he was being an idiot in his dealing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to see anyone busted specifically due to SR.

				I think most people that would get arrested would not rush back on to talk about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Sure it happens, but does that mean it&#039;s unsafe now?&nbsp; No, I don&#039;t think so anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />No matter who got busted being dumb, I think that if you watch yourself and don&#039;t take any chances, then you should be fine.

				The &quot;knock and talks&quot; aren&#039;t mentioned much here because if LE were watching the forum, the seized goods could be linked to SR and give the pigs another angle.&nbsp; This would be especially true in the smaller countries (population)<br />

				This is why you should never use western union and only accept bitcoins.<br />See the last phrase<br /><br />Registered: 03/06/09<br />Posts: 2,521<br />Loc: Canada Flag &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are Authorities Closing In On the Online Drug Market Silk Road?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; #16604558 - 07/28/12 03:25 PM (6 months, 9 hours ago) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Just over a year ago, we broke the story of Silk Road, the underground online market that&#039;s like an eBay for illegal drugs. It&#039;s been thriving ever since. But as the summer drags on, Silk Road users are becoming increasingly paranoid over a series of unexplained disappearances. And the Drug Enforcement Agency has now revealed it&#039;s investigating the site. Is Silk Road really as invincible as it seems?<br /><br />In early July, the DEA told the Austin TV news station KXAN that it was investigating Silk Road, where users openly buy and sell drugs, from heroin to ecstacy and pot. New York Senator Chuck Schumer had asked the DEA to look into the site after we first wrote about it about a year ago, but this is the first public acknowledgement that the DEA has heeded his call.<br /><br />Silk Road users don&#039;t seem immediately concerned about news of the investigation. &quot;ASSHOLE reporters writing lies,&quot; wrote user TrustusJones in a post about the article on Silk Road&#039;s bustling forums. He or she probably feels well-protected by the twin technologies Silk Road uses to keep users hidden: The anonymity software the Tor Network and Bitcoins, a nearly untraceable currency. (Proving its bona fides once again, Tor recently stymied an FBI kiddie porn investigation.)<br /><br />But over the past few months, a number incidents have suggested that Silk Road users are vulnerable, unsettling some users and sparking rumors of a crackdown. Don your tin-foil hat, and follow me.<br /><br />One of the most prominent incidents was the sudden disappearance of a much-beloved cocaine dealer named &quot;MiN,&quot; in May. For months, MiN, who claimed to live in Canada, had sold and shipped some of the highest quality coke in the dark netâ€”one user described it as &quot;STRONG, euphoria and some speediness.&quot; After he vanished, customers flocked to the Silk Road forums to complain that their orders hadn&#039;t been filled. Rumors swirled that MiN had been busted and that he was actually the alter ego of a family of four from Ottawa who were arrested in mid-May and charged with exporting huge amounts of cocaine abroad. (The Ottawa Royal Canadian Mounted Police would not comment on whether Silk Road was involved in the Ottawa case.)<br /><br />It was said that MiN tripped up by accepting Western Union money orders in addition to Bitcoins, which opened him up to being traced.

				Some Canadian family was busted allegations in the medIa that they were selling through SR. You may recall they had a good rep and I think the coke and heroin was reported as top class.<br /><br />Two Aussie teenage brothers, think there mum informed after they recieved packages and emerged from their bedrooms a week later talking about being able to read people&#039;s minds!<br /><br />To be honest you got more chance of being arrested, robbed, beaten or sold some dangerous drug outside of Silk Road<br /><br />As a buyer, if anything was discovered all I need do is deny ever sending for drugs ever! Deny and there is nothing the cops can do as long as the drop is &#039;clean&#039; and you don&#039;rt answer the door smoking a joint, wearing a ganja leaf t-shirt and playing Bob Marley VERY loud. If I was ever compromised I would get another new drop addy. People hire addys here for cigarettes and tobbacco so might as well get other thingd sent.<br /><br />There was an English vendor here whose packaging was so bad I would not be surprised if he got nicked. <br /><br />The biggest danger is resellers, who are basically vendors but who buy bulk here and sell at a profit. There danger is a cop possinf as a seller. If cops use the same mthods as scammers, fake accounts buying non exisant drugs. There are lots of computer savvy abd drug savvy cops wo could do that but the cops are losing jobs so have little time for chasing people selling drugs. A new generation of cops would not resist attempts to legalise. 70% of a cops work is related to minor drug offences. They resally would sooner catch the gun toting kids, and the knife happy schoolkids in London. Plus rape, murder, burgalry and other real crimes.<br /><br />Someone buying 20 grams of hash here is hardly a threat to society.<br /><br />Even someone buying heroin is at least not involkving kids who roam most areas witha bag of somwthing to sell. A lor of dealers in real life are rude, illmannered and lets face it, not really trustworthy chaps of a good character. There are some grreatRL dealers but most went to coke or heroin and now the guy who could always be relied on for good hash is&nbsp; more likely to have awful soapbar,which amazngly still sells!!<br /><br />I just hope all traders make sure our addys are deleted asap and that none keep any lists. No need to keep lists, if SR went down, we should have the emnails of vendors we use, plus there tons more sites popping up.<br /><br />You can sell on clearnet on the stealth. This is what everyone done before this encrypted internet moovd away from military and govt use and the people got acesss to the same technology.<br /><br />
