				i nearly shit 3 bricks when this happened. i had been logged out for over 3 hours, so i start up tor, head over to silk road and the first think that i saw was my profile. no white screen with the login and captcha or anything. my first instinct was to refresh to make sure that i wasnt actually still logged in. which I wasnt. when i refreshed it took me to the login page.<br /><br />but that doesnt really matter.<br /><br />this should never happen. at all. ever. to anybody, especially sellers. <br /><br /><br />i am unsure if it is an issue with tor, mozilla firefox or silkroad. but whatever the reason,&nbsp; it has left me paranoid as ever.<br /><br /><br />WORST CASE SCENARIO<br /><br />LEO raids house, finds computer, sees tor, logs on, goes to silk road and BLAMMO my profile just sitting there. <br /><br /><br />^^^^<br />what im afraid of.&nbsp;

				There was thread on why forum posts sometimes don&#039;t show up immediately:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2086.0 <br /><br />It&#039;s probably the same thing.&nbsp; Tor&#039;s configuration for Firefox has the browser&#039;s caching turned off.&nbsp; This may be an issue caused by Tor&#039;s caching.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				virtual maschines could be solution to your paranoja probs.<br /><br />use a unique vm for specific stuff,<br />have em on a encrypted partition,<br />use encryption on the vm&#039;s os,<br />set screensaver to autolock pc after 5 mins or so.<br /><br />Besides having a keylogger/tojan on the host/vm system<br />only removing the memory from you pc and reading it immidiatly<br />could provide any evidence.<br />While the atack on direct reading ram is possible it is highly unlikely tho<br />unless u sell nukes or something.<br />Usually normal LEA who deal with whatever is going on on SR are not blessed<br />with that level of equickment.

				I had virtually the same thing happen a while back.&nbsp; I was running Windows, started Tor, &amp; vaguely remember there was a pop-up for a Firefox update.&nbsp; I ignored it.&nbsp; But apparently Firefox was updated automatically and the update broke the Tor config (that&#039;s my best guess).&nbsp; Next time I restarted Tor I looked under Preferences/Privacy, and I could see my SR cookies still there.&nbsp; Gaah!&nbsp; That is not supposed to happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />So now when I use Tor on Windows I manually clear the cookies after I log off &amp; before I shut down Tor. <br /><br />This experience greatly motivated me to start using Tails more often.

				IF for whatever reason you are running Tor in Windows at least be absolutely sure to use the newest versions. Though really you should be running a Tails Drive or a Virtual Machine. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
