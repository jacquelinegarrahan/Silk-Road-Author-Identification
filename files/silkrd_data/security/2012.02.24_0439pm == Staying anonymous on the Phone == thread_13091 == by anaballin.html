				Just wondering, I want to stay anonymous on the telephone.<br /><br />I went to Sprint and At&amp;T and they have the prepaid phones where you buy minutes... But they require you<br />to still sign a contract and has a monthly fee to a credit card.<br /><br />Where can I get a cellphone that I can just buy cash with no contract?

				U.S.? <br /><br />Wal-Mart, and most gas station convenience stores sell Tracphones.&nbsp; $15 (cash)&nbsp; gets you a cheap mobile with like 30 minutes use, but you can also buy cards to add more time.&nbsp; Use till you feel the number is compromised then ditch it.&nbsp; <br /><br />They require you to &quot;activate&quot; the phone on their web site.&nbsp; This is easily done on a public wi-fi with fake creds.&nbsp;

				trac is but one among many disposible pre-paid brands available. if ya wanna be even more anonymous, then only use text to avoid the possibility of vocal recogonition software ever being used. plus you get like 3 texts per talk minute, so its considerably cheaper. remember to remove the battery whenever approaching any &quot;sensitive&quot; areas if you truly wanna be sneaky...they come in really handy, specially when you hear one of ur friends gets busted and the popo went thru his cell. buy a sledge hammer at the same time to deal with this situation... ;)

				any 7Eleven close to the ghetto will have a whole range of phones. I&#039;ve been gone from the US for a while, but when I was over there those Virgin Mobile phones were the most popular among rock slingers.

				There are VOIP services that can be paid for in BTC, and require no verification. These can then be used over TOR, or through a public wi-fi connection. You can get a US-based phone number even if you&#039;re located in Australia. See the Bitcoin wiki for details.<br />
