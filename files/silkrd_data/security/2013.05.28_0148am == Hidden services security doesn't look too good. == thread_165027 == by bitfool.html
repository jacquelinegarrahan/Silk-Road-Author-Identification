				I read most of the paper, and I get the impression that in order to carry the attack you need to understand pretty well how the whole protocol works so your third option sounds likely. <br /><br />Also now I see that part of this information has already been posted a few days ago.

				You guys do realize that an actual cop doesn&#039;t have to be knowledgable in all this right? They have our lovely tax dollars to hire a super brain IT guy. Actually in this day and age I&#039;d expect some LE do just IT like the cops that work more the admin side. Police stations have computers right? Well who&#039;s in charge of setting up the networks for that and maintaining it? I&#039;m sure that person is more knowledgable than your average foot cop. There&#039;s databases in place and their own private network which has to be secure cause if it&#039;s not what&#039;s to stop me from breaking into their remotely and start fucking with info on the system. The point is there&#039;s someone that set that system in place at the Police station whether it be a contractor or some on the staff that would be their sole responsiblity.<br /><br />&nbsp;With that being said I&#039;m still highly skeptical about what that article proposes. We can sit here all day and theorycraft but what counts is real world results. Like Jack N Hoff said so why haven&#039;t they done it yet? Now some conspiracy theorists will say &#039;Well they&#039;re collecting as much info as possible on everyone and then the big bust comes&#039;. Again with that theory I&#039;m highly skeptical. There&#039;s bigger issues in the world and things the US government has to deal with.<br /><br />&nbsp;Like terrorism or the so called war or terror, a depression, China&#039;s rising economic power, a debt in trillion of dollars, and lack of innovation and manufacturing.&nbsp; Looking at that brief list I outlined if you were the US president and you had a budget where would you put money into? Would you really say Ok guys we need to get that fucking SR offline? I don&#039;t think it even makes it on that list. If SR was ever comprised it wouldn&#039;t be in the way that article propsed..well it would and it wouldn&#039;t. In my eyes the only way this whole thing would unravel is if DPR(or the conglomerates that represent DPR) ever slips up and makes one silly mistake. Like cashing out too many bitcoins at once or leaving a little trail. You&#039;d be suprised at what one piece of info can lead you to but again with that I&#039;m highly skeptical cause they&#039;re obviously pro&#039;s just from the fact they been going this long. <br /><br />So that leads us back to the main question: If they can do it why don&#039;t they?<br /><br />

				&gt;The problem is this is another theoretical attack - if it was possible they sure as hell wouldn&#039;t publish it without taking advantage of it. <br /><br />Why? The authors belong to academia. They are not necessarily black hat hackers. <br /><br />And let me mention again that silk road has been DoSed not long ago.<br /><br />Anyway, in case it needs to be spelled out, let me spell it out :<br /><br />That something hasn&#039;t happened yet is not a proof that it can&#039;t happen in the future.

It is effective at deanonymizing random hidden services among a large collection of hidden services (like the 40K that exist on the Tor network). It is not effective at deanonymiznig a specific hidden service.<br /><br />The attack works because the attacker can trawl for many HS descriptors in a short amount of time, and at relatively little cost. That&#039;s what most of the paper is about. But it relies on the fact that some hidden services randomly chose the attacker&#039;s node for their entry guard. That&#039;s why in the paper they deanonymized two hidden services controlled by them, which they configured to use their entry guard on purpose, and some bots in a botnet, because there are probably tens of thousands of these bots running as hidden services, so the chances were high that some of them chose the researchers&#039; entry guard.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t deanonymize SR or other specific, high value hidden services, nor could LE trivially do that with this attack, because the chances of those few hidden services randomly choosing LE&#039;s entry guard are extremely small. In fact, they could be running their own anonymously purchased, private entry guards, thus making the attack impossible. ;)<br /><br />

It is possible to configure your own nodes for guard nodes which blocks this attack.<br /><br />The second and more common configuration of a hidden service is to proxy the traffic through tor. Although it gets more complicated to explain it makes it much harder to De-anomize a hidden service. Think of it this way, the hidden service has to connect to other stuff. By proxying it through a tor client it hides the tor requests for a hidden service from the guard nodes.<br /><br />You can also vpn, tunnel, or proxy the traffic for the hidden service, further protecting your hidden service. There are also VSP&#039;s that allow you to sign up via tor and pay via bitcoin. Meaning even if they find the server there is little chance of them finding the owner.<br /><br />It really is interesting the more you dig into how this stuff works and every attack I have seen is only able to accomplish De-anomization by using the most basic of tor configurations.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Of course, the authors of this paper are being kind of hyperbolic, because the entry guard system itself protects from this attack being fully carried out to deanonymize all clients. However, there are attacks for deanonymizing hidden services with little resources, especially if the attacker is a LE level attacker and can use court orders against targeted guard nodes (or if they don&#039;t even need to use court orders, because of&nbsp; figuratively prehistoric communication privacy laws, which were mostly crafted ages ago to protect our physical mail and most recently telephone communications, and which are almost completely obsoleted when faced with modern intercept techniques). Tor started out with the goal of being a system that distributes trust in such a way that any one of the nodes you use can be compromised, and it doesn&#039;t compromise your anonymity. Using a single proxy is a single point of failure, Tor attempted to remove the single point of failure via its encryption techniques and using three nodes. Tor was celebrated for accomplishing this, but really it only superficially accomplished it. In reality, the entry node is far, far, far more important than any of the other nodes. For clients, having a bad entry guard is almost as bad as using a bad single hop proxy, in some scenarios it is essentially the same exact thing. In the case of hidden services, having a bad entry guard is in pretty much all scenarios just as bad as using a malicious single hop reverse proxy. The middle node and exit node are far less important, and for hidden services they are essentially worthless nodes. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The US government is paying 1.3 million dollars a year to the developers of TOR and the US government relies on it so much so much so I&#039;m sure the developers will keep ahead of the curve.&nbsp; I have faith.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Tor is low latency anonymity.

The second thing I want to say is that, although using persistent non-rotating entry guards can perfectly protect from this attack, it doesn&#039;t save hidden services from LE. They can still trace to entry guards, and then once again Tor is reduced to trusting a single hop proxy (well, actually three single hop proxies). So although the Tor configuration you suggest protects from an internal attacker (ie: the researchers in this paper), it doesn&#039;t protect from an external attacker who can monitor a targeted entry guard. If any of the entry guards are in the USA, tough luck because the feds don&#039;t even need a warrant for a pen register / trap and trace. Using layered guards can help to protect from this though, the trace always begins at the position of the attacker controlled node closest to the hidden service though. Layer enough guards and get lucky and you might have a moderately difficult to trace hidden service. Vanilla Tor is dangerously weak though. And the truth is that even some of the core Tor developers have essentially admitted this fact. They have taken to saying that you are even more screwed if you don&#039;t use Tor, which is an accurate although not very reassuring way to put things.

But even something that looks a lot like Tor can be much more anonymous than Tor. The first step is to reduce the number of entry guards selected by the client, beyond a doubt to two and it is possible that even using only one is the best option. The second step is to increase the number of nodes on a circuit and introduce layered guard nodes. The third step is to greatly reduce the frequency with which guard nodes are rotated, especially first layer guard nodes.&nbsp; The fourth step is to use PIR for HSDIR requests and to remove the concept of&nbsp; using a set of introduction nodes that persistently introduce for a specific hidden service. Perhaps something like SURBs, the single use reply blocks of type III remailers, can be used instead. In such a case the hidden service would layer encrypt a packet that routes toward it, publish the packet to the HSDIR, and the client would query the HSDIR with a PIR protocol to retrieve one of the signed SURB packets. Then the client would create a circuit and send the SURB to the first node specified, which would remove a layer of encryption revealing the second node specified, etc, all the way up to the hidden service. Something like this. Then the attacker would need to own the hidden services first layer entry guard to do an end point timing attack against connections to the hidden service. Additionally, they could only brute force up to the position of the layered guard node that they own that is closest to the hidden service. Additionally, there would no longer be a centralized set of introduction nodes to DoS. An additional measure that could be taken is using some system to encrypt hidden service addresses. My first thought was that hidden services could be queried for by the hash of their .onion address rather than their .onion address (of course with PIR in either case, but the hash would be used to obscure the list of all .onion addresses from the HSDIR nodes), with the retrieved information encrypted symmetrically with the actual .onion address of the hidden service. However, there have been issues identified with this hash based system. However, rransom, one of the Tor developers, proposed a different (much more advanced) solution that uses elliptic curve cryptography and blinding to get the same security properties without any of the pitfalls.<br /><br />I think that this is essentially the best that Tor can hope for without fundamentally changing itself into something else. Even this proposed set of changes includes significant reworkings of the hidden service protocol.

				Very interesting... do you think something like that could work if I wanted to develop a website that cpu;d conduct financial transactions? I started another thread on how a site or application could be developed to anonymize transactions. Like for example how Liberty Reserve got shut down. Ideally a market place like Silk Road should have a currency exhanger or monetary transmitter that is not traceable. Now that&#039;s the flaw in the whole plan. The money has to go or come from somewhere right? It&#039;s not like I can apply the concept of Freenode and just deposit money into other peoples account and take it out later. Until that gets figured out one day it will be use playing catch up and not the Feds. <br /><br />My speciality is more on the programming/web side just learning about networks now but find it quite fascinating. Can you imagine how infuriating it is for a DEA agent knowing that there&#039;s a marketplace that sells drugs and uses their own post service to mail it out. That my friend is poetic justice at it&#039;s finest. <br /><br />My concern is not that the DEA will figure out how to topple Bitcoin and SR but just with network security you have layers upon layers to protect yourself. It just seems the major flaw in this whole set up is the cashing out and buying of Bitcoins. I know Vendors have creative ways to cash out but don&#039;t they have enough responsibilities? The good vendors on here make nice cash but when you think about the risks they take on a daily basis it&#039;s not worth the money in the end. A lot if caught would be serving 5-10 years easy so if I&#039;m your average vendor making $3-5k and hustling like mad it just would be nice to have some kind of anyonmous financial transaction service. Fuck it. Here&#039;s a crazy idea. A few people around made Bitcoin atms so the technology is there but those guys were quoted saying they&#039;re scared shitless with all the new bank rules and the &#039;money transmitter&#039; clauses(utter bs) that they&#039;re machines will never go live and I thought this was a democracy?

It just requires LE to identify an entry guard by opening up many connections to the hidden service, and it&#039;s a lot scarier because it only takes 1-2 hours to find the entry guard, although probably days to weeks longer to monitor it and find the hidden service. However, that&#039;s way shorter than the 4-8 months it takes to carry out the attack in the recent paper. The best defense against the 2006 attack is layered entry guards, which are discussed in the original paper and still not implemented.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165027.msg1174109#msg1174109">Quote from: Miah on May 29, 2013, 05:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m still not 100% sure on how Tor works with the guard nodes and all the mechanisms in place.

Entry guards are chosen based on uptime and bandwidth. So right now there are about 3500 relays and 1200 entry guards. Here&#039;s a graph of how they change over time:<br /><br />https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=relayflags&amp;start=2012-02-29&amp;end=2013-05-29&amp;flag=Running&amp;flag=Guard#relayflags<br /><br />Your Tor client picks 3 entry guards and sticks with them for a month at a time. It does this &quot;randomly&quot; but based on bandwidth, otherwise small guards would be overloaded and the Tor network would be even slower. Your Tor client builds new circuits every 10 minutes, so before entry guards were created, your client would pick new entry nodes every 10 minutes. Going from 10 minutes to 1 month with the same entry nodes, you can see that was a big change in Tor client behavior.<br /><br />In the 2006 attack, LE opens many connections to a hidden service, until one of them happens to pass through a node they control, which is one hop away from the entry guard. That way they can identify the entry guard. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165027.msg1174109#msg1174109">Quote from: Miah on May 29, 2013, 05:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In another situation I would just say let people assign their own guard nodes for their site but that just opens the doors for attack and makes ToR completely useless.

Essentially the classifier that got over 60% accuracy only took a single loaded page into consideration to fingerprint a webpage, whereas with hidden markov models classifiers take an entire sequence of loaded pages into account to fingerprint a website. There was also an attack that could fairly accurately geolocate servers by measuring clock skew, not really a direct attack on Tor though. There are probably some others that I am not recalling as well. However as far as purely direct attacks on Tor go, pretty much in all cases they require the target to use at least one attacker controlled or monitored entry guard.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That one doesn&#039;t require an entry guard to be taken over.

This new attack is like 50% the 2006 attack anyway, &quot;own the hidden services entry guard to deanonymize it&quot;. But instead of brute forcing circuits against a specific hidden service, they just hope they can enumerate enough hidden service .onions to own an entry guard used by some of them. They really are taking a kind of alarmist tone with their paper, from what I can see, considering that it is nothing really new. The only new part is the technique of forcing yourself to the position of a particular hidden services HSDIR (I guess, I still have not read the full paper). From what I can tell they are taking a completely different approach than I would, once they can detect all clients attempting to connect to the hidden service I would try to get the clients to that specific hidden service with an end point timing attack between the HSDIR node and the clients entry guard. I have no idea how many hidden services they enumerated, but the % of hidden services they deanonymized with this attack should extrapolate to the % of clients they can deanonymize connecting to any particular hidden service. That is the scary part and it seems they completely overlooked that attack angle.

To quote him from the Torbutton design doc:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Website traffic fingerprinting is an attempt by the adversary to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific websites. In the case of Tor, this attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard node itself.<br /><br />The most comprehensive study of the statistical properties of this attack against Tor was done by Panchenko et al. Unfortunately, the publication bias in academia has encouraged the production of a number of follow-on attack papers claiming &quot;improved&quot; success rates, in some cases even claiming to completely invalidate any attempt at defense. These &quot;improvements&quot; are actually enabled primarily by taking a number of shortcuts (such as classifying only very small numbers of web pages, neglecting to publish ROC curves or at least false positive rates, and/or omitting the effects of dataset size on their results). Despite these subsequent &quot;improvements&quot;, we are skeptical of the efficacy of this attack in a real world scenario, especially in the face of any defenses.<br /><br />In general, with machine learning, as you increase the number and/or complexity of categories to classify while maintaining a limit on reliable feature information you can extract, you eventually run out of descriptive feature information, and either true positive accuracy goes down or the false positive rate goes up. This error is called the bias in your hypothesis space. In fact, even for unbiased hypothesis spaces, the number of training examples required to achieve a reasonable error bound is a function of the complexity of the categories you need to classify.<br /><br />In the case of this attack, the key factors that increase the classification complexity (and thus hinder a real world adversary who attempts this attack) are large numbers of dynamically generated pages, partially cached content, and also the non-web activity of entire Tor network. This yields an effective number of &quot;web pages&quot; many orders of magnitude larger than even Panchenko&#039;s &quot;Open World&quot; scenario, which suffered continous near-constant decline in the true positive rate as the &quot;Open World&quot; size grew (see figure 4). This large level of classification complexity is further confounded by a noisy and low resolution featureset - one which is also relatively easy for the defender to manipulate at low cost.<br /><br />To make matters worse for a real-world adversary, the ocean of Tor Internet activity (at least, when compared to a lab setting) makes it a certainty that an adversary attempting examine large amounts of Tor traffic will ultimately be overwhelmed by false positives (even after making heavy tradeoffs on the ROC curve to minimize false positives to below 0.01%). This problem is known in the IDS literature as the Base Rate Fallacy, and it is the primary reason that anomaly and activity classification-based IDS and antivirus systems have failed to materialize in the marketplace (despite early success in academic literature).<br /><br />Still, we do not believe that these issues are enough to dismiss the attack outright. But we do believe these factors make it both worthwhile and effective to deploy light-weight defenses that reduce the accuracy of this attack by further contributing noise to hinder successful feature extraction. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#website-traffic-fingerprinting
