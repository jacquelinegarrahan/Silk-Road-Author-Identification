				Two statements that jumped out at me.<br /><br />1. &quot;I was in contact with the EFF this month regarding the issue.<br />They referred me to some lawyers, but basically, the advice to me in<br />general has been is that no digital information is protected from<br />snooping unless it is stored in your home and encrypted. But even<br />then, I am told that silent &quot;black bag&quot; jobs (tampering your home<br />electronic devices) are a possibility if you are labeled a threat to<br />national security.&quot;<br /><br />2. &quot;These people don&#039;t understand technology and don&#039;t understand<br />what they are asking for many times. They also don&#039;t understand even<br />the most basic concepts of how the Internet works. I presume the<br />non-field agents (the people that are in operations centers and don&#039;t<br />talk to people) are the ones that penetrate the end-user<br />electronically, as necessary.&quot;<br /><br />https://www.noisebridge.net/pipermail/noisebridge-discuss/2013-March/035200.html<br /><br /><br />==========<br /><br /><br />NSLs were still alive and kicking up until a week of so ago, when the<br />EFF&#039;s successful ruling was announced. The EFF has let me know that<br />the ruling only stands for 90 days and that there is a possibility the<br />ruling will be rescinded after that upon appeal. So, we are not safe<br />yet. I was in contact with the EFF this month regarding the issue.<br />They referred me to some lawyers, but basically, the advice to me in<br />general has been is that no digital information is protected from<br />snooping unless it is stored in your home and encrypted. But even<br />then, I am told that silent &quot;black bag&quot; jobs (tampering your home<br />electronic devices) are a possibility if you are labeled a threat to<br />national security.<br /><br />Here is some feedback I can share, since I am a rare person to have<br />realized the snooping was in effect while it was occurring. I also got<br />confirmation of this due to lack of a confidentiality requirement when<br />multiple agents attempted to visit me in person and called me on the<br />phone. They wanted to follow-up after their many months of snooping<br />revealed that I was not in fact a &quot;terrorist&quot; -- simply a security<br />researcher that had identified vulnerabilities of a North American<br />utility company. After half a year of working with the utility<br />company, they did nothing to protect my own data, so I went online to<br />blow the whistle about the company being breached and all user data<br />(including home addresses and names) being compromised. With this<br />vulnerability, someone could effectively find your home address /<br />phone / name on account no matter where you lived in North America,<br />since you are required to provide this when receiving utility service.<br />To my knowledge, the companies involved have still not gone public<br />with this information.<br /><br />Some things the Secret Service did to snoop on me that you should also<br />be aware of, and some feedback follow:<br /><br />* SS served Google with an NSL to obtain my account information.<br /><br />* Around January, upon logging into the Google account, Google showed<br />a strange NOTICE message asking me to accept the terms of usage of my<br />account. This was odd, because in a decade of being a Google user, I<br />had never seen this. I am told that this is Google&#039;s way of &quot;telling<br />you without telling you&quot; that you have been served an NSL. Google, by<br />law, is not allowed to tell you about the NSL, but they definitely are<br />within their right to ask you to accept their TOS upon login. This is<br />the &quot;tell&quot; that everyone here should be aware of. If you see this, you<br />are likely being monitored.<br /><br />* My Google account was being operated by someone else, despite<br />utilizing 2-step and very strong passwords. This may have been limited<br />to a Google Chat 0day, unpublished vulnerability, or a Google<br />backdoor. My chat contacts said I was online when I was not online or<br />had messaged them, when I had not.<br /><br />* I received multiple emails from shady individuals asking me to<br />provide / sell 0day. Some were in poor English. I presume this may<br />have been a baiting tactic to get me on some technicality. I did not<br />sell any 0day nor did I accept their request to &quot;help them&quot; with<br />whatever they were seeking in terms of shady deals.<br /><br />* One of my encrypted Desktop home Linux computers was mysteriously<br />wiped upon my return from a trip. The RAID array was &#039;corrupted&#039;.<br /><br />* People I know started getting strange calls from random numbers at<br />odd hours. I wonder if this was some attempt to exploit remote<br />listening flaws in some phones, but I am justly paranoid.<br /><br />* Someone opened mail / packages at my physical residence to reveal<br />the contents inside. This was very odd and not something that ever<br />happens. It occurred at least twice to my knowledge.<br /><br />* Local police were posted outside my residence the morning I received<br />numerous calls from SS agents.<br /><br />* SS confirmed over the phone that they monitored my Google account,<br />after I told them I knew they were. At first, they would not tell me<br />they did and denied it. The agent actually said &quot;Google should not<br />have told you that&quot;. When I asked how many other online accounts they<br />monitored, the agent refused to let me know the details. When asked if<br />they monitored my financial / banking / health records, they said the<br />surveillance was limited to electronic records. I presume this<br />includes my ISP, Google, phone, any accounts signed up via Google<br />(third-party registration / account emails give it away), etc.<br /><br />* I was told that my security research activities are a &quot;legal grey<br />area&quot;, but that the investigation was being closed. The SS said that<br />the data they have on me &quot;is safe&quot; and &quot;will be destroyed&quot; after some<br />&quot;expiration period&quot;. I vehemently expressed my distrust that it would<br />be held securely or destroyed.<br /><br />For your background, I have been on the other side of such requests,<br />as the person providing data to the Secret Service field agents<br />before. These people don&#039;t understand technology and don&#039;t understand<br />what they are asking for many times. They also don&#039;t understand even<br />the most basic concepts of how the Internet works. I presume the<br />non-field agents (the people that are in operations centers and don&#039;t<br />talk to people) are the ones that penetrate the end-user<br />electronically, as necessary. Unfortunately, I have no evidence to<br />support the above other than the strange activity on my account. An<br />entirely separate and more likely scenario is that the Secret Service<br />communications are hacked by Nation States that used that surveillance<br />to target me directly. A scary assumption, but not out of the<br />question. Mitnick was reading GOV emails long ago and I would have to<br />presume that adversaries are snooping GOV emails still to this day.<br /><br />If you have any other insights, I would be glad to hear them. I would<br />love to speak with anyone else that can come forward as an NSL victim.<br /><br />On Wed, Mar 20, 2013 at 5:10 PM, Andy Isaacson &lt;adi at hexapodia.org&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; Did you receive one of the few NSLs without a confidentiality<br />&gt; requirement, or did you manage to get it set aside, or are you relying<br />&gt; on Judge Illston&#039;s decision in this disclosure?&nbsp; (Just curious.)<br /><br />It did not have a confidentiality requirement, to my knowledge. I am<br />attempting to get the FOIA data on myself, but it has been rejected<br />thus far.<br />

				Interesting read, thanks astor. This reinforces my decision to live &#039;off the grid&#039;.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not the same but Google used to ask me for my mobile phone number all the time, i&#039;d just enter in the numerical equivalent of 040F UCK YOU.<br /><br />I&#039;ve long since stopped using any of these &#039;Social&#039; services, Google, Facebook, Youtube. Deleted all my accounts with them (as far as i know, who knows if they really delete it permanently) and have never been back. Now I have a much better IRL relationship with my few close friends, not over a copper wire/optical cable friendship.<br /><br />Thanks SR for allowing me to generate a tax-free blackmarket income ;) Thanks SR for allowing me to own a mobile phone that is untraceable and uses anonymous simcards ;) Thanks SR for allowing me to own an anonymous internet connection ;) These three factors are, i believe, the most important structures to living un-noticed in this world today.
