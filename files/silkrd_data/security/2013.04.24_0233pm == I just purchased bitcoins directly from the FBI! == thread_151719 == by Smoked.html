				Or I might as well have.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />I just went to a site that allows you to buy bitcoins directly with your credit card. However, the list of required verifications is a bit extreme....<br /><br />Required Verifications:<br /><br />1. Upload government issued photo id (Driver&#039;s License)<br />2. Email verification.<br />3. Cell phone verification. (text/pin)<br />4. Credit/Debit card in my name.<br />5. Trust Cloud account. <br /><br />Additionally the Trust Cloud account required the following:<br />1. Full and complete access to my personal Facebook account.<br />2. Phone Verification<br />3. Email verification. <br /><br />THEN<br />During checkout they *ONLY* use Google Checkout which of course requires a google account as well as a VOICE VERIFICATION.....<br /><br />After this the coins were deposited into a VERIFIED Blockchain wallet. <br /><br />So now I have these bitcoins that are LESS anonymous and LESS secure than possibly any other form of money in history. I might as well buy drugs directly from the DEA in front of a police station...while news crews are filming it live.<br /><br />*****************************<br />************************************<br />****************************************<br /><br />I gave you all that prelude to ask this simple question:<br /><br />How would I now *wash* these coins to make them anonymous again....or at least anonymous enough to use at SilkRoad....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. Of course I know how to buy bitcoins anonymously and have done it many times in the past.....

There is tons of info here for you to go through and make sure you&#039;re not exposed and you did it regardless of what you knew to be right? Every time someone gets busted and tied to this site it just makes it that much more of a problem for the whole SR community am I right? Increased LE activity is never good and people who make it easy to be caught will end up ruining all the fun for everyone else. I actually wish it were more difficult to get to SR. It might have stopped the influx of morons and scammers.

				I hope the place was cheap, since they don&#039;t believe in &#039;privacy&#039;.&nbsp; I bet that was why BitFloor&#039;s bank account was &#039;frozen&#039;. It&#039;s a bitch when the &#039;law&#039; is so vague that banks will shut you down even when you are working within the confines of the law. How can any BTC trader like BitFloor anticipate intent? They can&#039;t, so in effect they are the &#039;little guys&#039; who always seem to lose out, while the big guys chisel down the playing field to just themselves (just us?)<br />I do love the technological aspects that advance the little guys freedom (like in the book &quot;An army of Davids&quot;)-they will be making positive changes while the government is playing catch up (and working hand in glove with the &#039;big&#039; guys who are cynical (and rich)

It&#039;s probably not necessary for the average SR user to go to these lengths of obfuscating, but if you can, then why not do it? This got me thinking, so I started making a list of anonymous to semi-anonymous ways of buying/selling bitcoins and then methods to tumble/obfuscate bitcoins that could be linked to an identity. I would appreciate anyone&#039;s input if they can vouch for a service they&#039;ve used so I can keep the compiled list up to date as much as possible for anyone else to reference.

				They do all that checking to make sure the credit card you&#039;re using isn&#039;t stolen. Credit cards will reverse the charge from the bitcoin vendor if the card was stolen so the bitcoin vendor is just trying to cover their ass on stolen cards. I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s anti-money laundering or anything.

				There is some info in the Wiki about washing coins by using one of the &#039;fog&#039; services mentioned above but at the end of the day it all depends on what you plan to do with the coins. <br /><br />If you want to use them here then definitely do some transferring between &#039;burn&#039; wallets or use the fog service which does the same thing I think but just really quickly and automated. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t plan to use them here then no harm no foul I guess.. In fact I have often thought about setting up a separate wallet to use for legit BTC purchases and making a point of using it where available. The idea being along the same lines as having a second &#039;burn&#039; mobile phone and using it for the sole purpose of dodgy shenanigans and such while keeping the personal one 100% clean...<br /><br />&nbsp;I know of a few guys who only have the dodgy &#039;burner&#039; phone which seems stupid .. they always have a phone in their hand yet on paper they have never owned one or had a number in their name or anyone else like gf etc..... o_O. <br /><br />Its a little different in that I have always had a personal phone and when needed added the dodgy one but the reverse is the case with my wallets.. always had the dodgy one so a legit one to have as a decoy or cover seems like a good idea.. I mean at least then if ever asked about what I do with all these BTC I can admit using them while remaining plausible with the spin..<br /><br />Whatever you do though I guess you should not use that wallet again especially to transfer coins here..<br /><br />Hope you don&#039;t have any issues mate but I&#039;m sure if your smart from here in you will be fine.<br /><br />If it was LiteCoins on the other hand... I&#039;d be shitting bricks and sweating bullets if that was the case!!
