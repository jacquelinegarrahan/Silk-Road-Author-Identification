				Since I keep reading that people handle police very poorly on this forum, I was wondering if there was a collection of smarter ways of dealing with police and/or arrests here.<br /><br />Any of you have any advice for how to deal with police?<br /><br />Here are some resources to start things off:<br /><br />http://www.itsuptoyou.net/how-to-deal-with-cops-and-get-out-of-crimes/<br /><br />http://www.ilawyerguide.com/basics/arrested.php<br /><br />http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform-immigrants-rights-racial-justice/know-your-rights-what-do-if-you

				Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br />Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br />Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br />Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br />Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br />Don&#039;t answer your door if you&#039;re not expecting company.<br />Don&#039;t smoke marijuana in your car. <br />Follow traffic laws.<br />Don&#039;t consent to searches (aka don&#039;t talk to the police)<br />Don&#039;t lie to police. If they catch you in a lie, you&#039;re fucked just as bad or worse than if you admit to any crime. But you don&#039;t have to worry about getting caught in a lie if you... Don&#039;t talk to the police.

				Thank you for these vital resources. I make it a habit to avoid attention from the PoPo, but this information could very well save someones ass.
