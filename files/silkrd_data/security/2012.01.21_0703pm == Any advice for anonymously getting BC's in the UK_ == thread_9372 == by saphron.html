				I&#039;m still new to all this, but I am increasingly confused about the best way to get BC&#039;s safely and anonymously, especially here in the UK. A lot of the advice on here is for the US market, so what do fellow Britts do to get their coins? Are there any banks over here that accept cash for BC&#039;s etc?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />&nbsp;

				Moneypak. You don&#039;t want to buy BTC at a bank, even though you can&#039;t do that, because it would leave a trail. The point in BTC is so there is no paper trail. After you buy moneypak, hit up BTC buddy and he&#039;ll help you out.

As far as I can see, no moneypacks available here.<br /><br />So, I can pay cash into any bank as long as I have Intersango&#039;s account info then? Does anyone have much experience of them?<br /><br />I suppose the only other option I have is to find someone with a good rep who exchanges UKASH for BC&#039;s. The only person I&#039;ve found so far is Overweight. Does anyone have experience of him/her? <br /><br />EDIT....I was also thinking of using Sugar Mama and Moneygram. I&#039;ve never used it before, but looking at the website it says ID may be needed - which is a big turn off obviously. Can anyone clarify this please?<br /><br />Thanks everyone. I hate feeling to great noob, but I&#039;ll get up to speed soon enough!

				I summorise, can easily research specific methods or site or do as lots of threads covering this.<br />these are straight forward methods, are anonymous unless you transfer from your bank a/c :-<br /><br />1. get ukash from any paypoint in uk [not sure of commisions...}<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;transfer / convert ukash into BTC&#039;s, OR<br />- couple of hours, one to buy the ukash then to convert bid/buy bitcoins.<br />- there doesn&#039;t seem to be much support for ukash --&gt; btc..<br /><br />2. open / create a BTC a/c with http;//www.britcoin.co.uk {= intersango}, once account is opened their corresponding bank a/c for your use is shown ...when you logon...<br />&nbsp;make a Â£50 +&nbsp; cash deposit into britcoin&#039;s / intersango&#039;s nominated bank a/c DON&#039;T FORGET TO ENSURE CASHIER ENTERS THE BANK REF NO otherwise <br />&nbsp; be a small issue recognising the deposit with your britcoin a/c.<br />- can easily take half a day and maybe even longer to actually bid/buy bitcoins.<br /><br /><br />ok ?!<br />&nbsp;;)<br />
