				So what&#039;s the issue here? Money not arriving at all, or taking longer than usual? My test payment went well enough (took about 4 working days) and btc&#039;s orders were processed immediately.

				I&#039;ve used them twice.&nbsp; The first time I went into my local Loyds, and the money showed up a couple of hours later!<br /><br />Then I read on here about Loyds accounts being dodgy. That one of their Directors had done a bunk and he was the only one with access to their Loyds account! <br /><br />This concerned me, and having no Metro bank near by, I used Ukash vouchers. They worked fine!!<br /><br />Seeing as all vendors demand you finalise early, What good are bitcoins?&nbsp; You are not guaranteed your money back with bitcoins finalizing early.<br /><br />And if you don&#039;t finalise early , no one will do business with you!!<br /><br />I stupidly travelled to London to the main Metro bank, I paid my money in and 3 days later it is not in my Intersango account!!<br /><br />They have no customer service, I got 1 reply from about 7 emails.<br /><br />FUCK INTERSANGO AND FUCK BITCOIN<br /><br />OH JUST FUCK IT :&#039;(

				Relax, it took 4 days with my transfer. Think you should start worrying after 5 days or so. As for FE here, that&#039;s unrelated. I have so far read no negative reports concerning scams and FE for trusted sellers.

				Cool, fair point clixor!<br /><br />It&#039;s been a long hard shitty week. I wouldnt mind waiting 4-5 days. <br /><br />If thats what I was told to expect. <br /><br />But I was informed 24 hrs tops probably less.<br /><br />3 days late, the least they could do is answer my emails.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a great deal to ask.<br /><br />As for me, my little package would have been in the post by now, possibly coming through my letter box tomorrow morning!!<br /><br />As for Fe . All I meant was your meant to be protected by using Bitcoin. But Infact your not at all. And next time I will see if the vendor takes another <br /><br />form of payment! Preferably one that doesn&#039;t give me brain damage!! <br /><br />Thats me done moaning!! Peace out :)
