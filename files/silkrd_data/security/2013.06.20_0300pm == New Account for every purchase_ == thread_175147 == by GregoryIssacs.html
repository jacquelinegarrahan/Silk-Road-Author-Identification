				Would it not be wise to start a new account for every purchase that way it keeps everything fresh.&nbsp; I know this wouldn&#039;t fly for all the vendors that ask for FE for 1st time buyers but if you can establish yourself with a trusty worthy vendor, why wouldn&#039;t he be down for knowing you&#039;re going to open up a new account to keep all the buys fresh from different accounts?&nbsp;

				I get your logic but the way i see it is there should never be any account linked to you even if you get caught should there?<br /><br />I say this because if you get caught then its most likely because you have had a package intercepted and they managed to get you on it! But they have no way of knowing which account on SR bought that package so they couldn&#039;t link the other purchases to you anyway! The only way they would have of finding out which user you are on SR is if you gave them this information or had it stored somewhere on you computer (and that would just be stupid!!). They could also maybe link you to an account in the forums by information you may have given away in you posts so i guess it could help you in that situation! <br /><br />I could be wrong and you may be able to point out a scenario where this would help but IMO the only thing your doing is putting yourself at a disadvantage with limiting who you can buy from because you always look like a noob (as you have mentioned)

				No, you would never be able to build up your buyer stats, which vendors use to decide whether or not they would like to offer their service to you, knowing if you are a repeat buyer and maybe throw you extra. Most reputable vendors are critical on your buyer stats and for good reason.

Build up your stats, it&#039;s an important part of SR trade.

				Not a good idea. Stats are extremely important (for purchases, resolutions, trust etc). Telling a vendor &quot;hey man, it&#039;s me JohnDoe.. but I ditched that account and am now using JoeBlow..&quot; might raise a red flag to the vendor. Stats are important. Build &#039;em.
