				Well after a day or two of frusturation trying alternatives to bitinstant, i tried ZIGGAP, and I must say I&#039;m satisfied so far. Easy, anonymous, and relatively quick, much quicker than the MP to BTC vendors on SR, anyhow. From the time i sent funds, it was maybe 3 hours or so tops before i was counting confirmations on blockchain. Will try to answer any questions you may have.

				Thanks for starting this post because I am on the same boat as you. I don&#039;t know wtf is up with bitinstant with their site revision bullshit saying that they will be open after the weekend but it is still down. The problem with this is that it has been my only way of buying them coins and I must say it was always very straight forward but I needed to deposit some cash for coins today to purchase some stuff on SR&nbsp; and I was not able to. <br /><br />Some questions about ZigGap; <br /><br />Do i have the option to choose what Walmart to deposit the cash? <br />Is it 100% safe? <br />Is ZigGap a real non bogus site?

				You can use WU or moneygram, any location you want. There is risk involved, you&#039;re sending funds and expecting them to hold up their end. But it worked for me, i got my coins and everything was legit, anonymous, and easy. Not sure why people are scared of WU, i never show my id to SEND, only receive. Overall, yes i would use ziggap again.

				So I&#039;m curious on this also.&nbsp; Does WU just require the order # and the exact amount?
