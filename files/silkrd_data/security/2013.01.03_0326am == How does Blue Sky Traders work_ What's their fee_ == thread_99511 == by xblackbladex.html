				How does it work? You anonymously send wires to them through the local bank? I just read about them for the first time today. Sounds interesting. MoneyPaks a ripoff, bitinstant sketches me out and mtgox well yeah they sketch me out too.

				Would Bank of America know that I&#039;m buying bitcoins with the cash deposit. I&#039;d rather not have to use fake information in a bank with lots of cameras and security. And yeah, what kind of fees would there be. I will only consider usingthis method if there are no fees or they are cheaper than those with bitinstant at Walmart.

				From what I&#039;ve heard you don&#039;t have to provide provide any information except for BST account name and number(it&#039;s just a regular bank deposit) and there is no fee.

				There&#039;s technically no fee but the BTC&#039;s I believe are a little bit more expensive. That&#039;s just the price you pay for how easy and anonymous it is.

				does anyone know the easiest way to get bitcoins if you have no feed back yet on SR and or new the forums? I would wanna do the bank of america deposit but there isn&#039;t a bank of america near me :( and the vendor i was trying to work with won&#039;t let me do a overnight cash in the mail option because i have no feed back yet on my SR account (totally understandable)

				Thanks Nuggets2, I found it.&nbsp; I have been in touch with Blue Sky and they are incredibly helpful.&nbsp; I look forward to doing business with them and will post as to how it goes.&nbsp; I&#039;m fortunate in that I have a B of A branch just down the street from where I live.
