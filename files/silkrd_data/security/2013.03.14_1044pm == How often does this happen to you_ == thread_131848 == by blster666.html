Hes either saying to scramble and then delete your information, or just virtual box it. Search under the security forum for &quot;virtual box&quot; and there are step by step guides.

Just an idea........<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hehe, Same here. Before I made my very first purchase I sat down and thought about this really hard as I can get somewhat paranoid leaving any traces behind. I am using an old laptop to make purchases and never use my wireless either. I do however use my primary PC to just roam these forums but that is about it. <br /><br />To make myself feel better. I completely wiped my laptop&#039;s hard drive clean last night. It took almost 8 hours to do it. Used something bank&#039;s use to wipe their hdd&#039;s. <br /><br />On the other note, I need to know something so I hope you guy can tell me what you think about this;<br /><br />The vendor claims he figured out a new way to do priority/tracking on his home page. Now, when I tracked the package again last night (still sitting in the same place) it says that the postage was conducted electronically &quot;Electronic Shipping Info Received&quot;. I then told myself wait a min, I see this when I purchase labels via ebay for customers and when I check to see if they received their order. <br />Why would a vendor have an account with USPS to ship stuff? <br />What if he used Tor to do this which would ring an alarm. Wouldn&#039;t that be like shooting yourself in the foot? <br /><br />All my previous packages were hand written and done manually. Why would this vendor send out my info via clear-net to USPS electronically? <br />I am not sure, but it may be allowed so what do you guys think? <br /><br />I appreciate the input from everyone so far.

You don&#039;t have ANY say over who is allowed to send you mail. If you could be held responsible for the contents of mail bearing your name, anyone&#039;s enemies could just mail leaky bags of cocaine to them on purpose to get them raided or arrested. Duh.
