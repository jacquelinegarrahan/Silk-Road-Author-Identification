				Is ti possible to purchase bitcoins with a prepaid visa / american express gift card? <br /><br />If so, how? <br /><br />Also, if someone could explain how bitcointalks.com works specifically, that would be much appreciated. <br /><br />Thank you all!

				Bitcointalks is a scam. The prepaid debit card thing sounds like a good idea, but I think its kind of unnecessary. If you pay cash, its just as anonymous. I think you would be just wasting the 5.95 fee to load the card.

				i actually looked up bitcoinstalks and you&#039;re right. Multiple listings on google popped up saying &quot;scammer&quot;, &quot;scam&quot;, etc. <br /><br />How would the prepaid visa card work though? At the moment i use blockchain for my bitcoin wallet<br /><br />Thank you for the advice!

				Just use the market, pay cash to a bank and use a computer not connected to you. Then you can tumble them and/or switch up wallets before depositing them here. Bitcoin&#039;s are part of a world wide trading market. Thousands are bought and sold every day and they are very hard to track.

				You may be able to through mtgox using the 7/11 option. I&#039;m not 100% positive but I heard it&#039;s possible to use a cc/debit card at one of those locations.<br />As for online, it&#039;s impossible right now. I&#039;ve searched for hours, even considered backing my own transactions with my btc through a merchant. Might end up coming to this, we&#039;ll see.

				Bitcoins aren&#039;t as difficult to use as you think. There are even utube videos on how to buy them with cash. <br />Don&#039;t worry it took me a few days to figure it out too. But with bitinstant it is very easy to deposit cash and get bitcoins into your wallet. <br /><br />Through bitinstant you you sign up. All the personal info you give bitinstant can be fake if you want. <br /><br />Then the site will take you to zip zap fill that form and copy the receipt. <br /><br />Go to western union and fill out the pay a bill form ( I think its the blue one ) <br /><br />Take the cash to the cashier and pay.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they ask you any questions ( they won&#039;t ) you are paying a bill. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be nervous or anything. Bitcoins are legal to own.<br /><br />Take a breath and just get familiar with the technology. Bitcoins were hard for me to wrap my head around too. I have used tor and encryption for a long time now but never used bitcoins before so it took some research to figure it out.<br /><br />All the resources out side of Sr are more confusing. The folks here make it a lot easier to understand. There are a lot of threads on bit coins here. Give yourself time and you will get it.<br />&nbsp;<br />Paying in cash would make it near impossible for anyone to track the coins back to you. Even if they could it doesn&#039;t matter since there legal to own. <br /><br />You might get more cash if you sold the card instead withdrawing cash from it. Depends on how big the fee is.
