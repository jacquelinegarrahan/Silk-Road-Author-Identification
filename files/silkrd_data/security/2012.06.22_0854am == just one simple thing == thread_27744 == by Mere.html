				I read a lot of the security threads as often as I can and I just realized I haven&#039;t seen anyone ever mention this simple advice. <br /><br />Always tip your mailman around the holidays.<br /><br />It might not make a major difference, but it&#039;s just a good idea to have the guy that delivers your gear to think the best of you.<br /><br />I grew up with a mailman as my Dad. I heard stories growing up. The mailman knows more about you then you could even realize. Let him know you appreciate him/her. A card is not enough, put a $20 in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />

				+ 1from myself.<br /><br />Not too sure about tipping them, but definitely maintaining good relations with your regular guy/gal makes so much sense. They&#039;re unlikely to want to cooperate with LE should that situation ever arise.<br /><br />And if they did ever get enlisted by LE to do a controlled delivery, the tension and guilt would most likely be written all over their face. Everyone&#039;s a winner!

Although, a nice little cash tip around the holidays assures you he will not forget you.<br /><br />If not cash I have seen my dad come home with wine, fruit baskets and sports tickets as well. These can be just as good. Also, make sure you hand him the gift and shake his hand and thank him. Let him know who you are.<br /><br />My dad always said to tip your mailman around the holidays. it was like his motto. <br />I recon he kept a list of houses on his route he would never fuck with, because he has had to notify LE on multiply instances that I know of. Mostly just scumbags beating their kids or what have you. <br /><br />Which I guess also raises another suggestion if you plan on committing felonies; don&#039;t be a scumbag (at least don&#039;t look like one)

I expect most people here are respectable middle-class types, shit, there&#039;s even a crack and H head here that sounds like he went to fee paying British school. I might start calling him Harr-oin Potter!<br /><br />Quite looking forward to being able to tip the mailman in Bitcoins... they&#039;re not always strangers to drug use these postmen you know (not insinuating anything about your pops though)
