				First you gotta get it to pop some punk ass bloods, and then pound on it for a few seconds to blood it in, and make sure it knows the only way out is to be wiped out with random data. Then wrap a blue bandana around it and shove a blunt in one of the air intake vents. Shit will be cripped like a motherfucker.

				If you don&#039;t even know how to spell &quot;encrypt&quot; correctly, then you have problems beyond what anyone on this board can help you with. Shoot yourself troll.

				The first step is to learn to spell it, the rest comes naturally (or with startpage/duckduckgo).

				&nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing that much be established, are you running MAC or Windows? If your running mac my best suggestion is to use its own encryption software FileVault2, its the same if not better then most after market encryption tools when used properly. If your running Windows, as someone above suggested, TrueCrypt is what you looking for, partially because its open source thus reducing any chance of some backdoor issues blah blah blah, but also free and you can do WholeDiskEncryption. It&#039;s pretty simple to do once you get the hang of it. I personally find that youtube seems to resolve a lot of technical issues with computers and applications, there is a start for you my friend :)<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				What you do not appear to have considered is that hard drive encryption is, at best, a fallback strategy. <br /><br />The single best, defense is to be anonymous.&nbsp; If you are anonymous, you cannot be located, you cannot be raided. <br /><br />Furthermore, data is only protected so long as the encrypted drives/containers are unmounted. As long as the drives//containers are mounted, they can be read just as easily as if they were not encrypted. Encryption is not magical pixie dust that automatically confers protection against any and all threats. <br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (MIT clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: https://keys.indymedia.org/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B&nbsp; &nbsp; (IndyMedia https: clearnet keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br />

				@nightcrawler<br /><br />I get what you&#039;re saying, I really do. But I have to oppose that and say encryption isn&#039;t just a fallback but it literally as important, if not MORE important, as being anonymous. <br /><br />For instance in the cases I have read about our counterparts from other dark corners of Tor (you know, the pedophiles) somehow being caught out in public with their encryption mounted and their sicko porn open to customs agents. They go to court but their laptops have since been powered down and they &#039;forgot&#039; the key.<br /><br />Not so anonymous and guilty as all hell. But that damn encryption saved their ass. <br /><br />Regardless. Always encrypt and be anonymous at all costs. If you&#039;re in a panicky situation, destroy that shit. <br /><br />I know I&#039;ve microwaved hard drives in drug-induced paranoia spells. <br />And god damn it did I regret that a couple days later.&nbsp;

I agree with nightcrawler, anonymity trumps drive encryption. In the case of message encryption, in some cases it is required to maintain anonymity, such as if you are sending a shipping address to a vendor. If you are crossing customs then FDE could be just as important as using Tor, but most people do not randomly have their computers seized and searched by the feds, and for them it is way more important to not be located in the first place than it is to have their drive encrypted. If you are putting yourself in a situation where you know your computer is subject to arbitrary searches then of course using encryption is very important, but for every other scenario it is indeed a fallback strategy.
