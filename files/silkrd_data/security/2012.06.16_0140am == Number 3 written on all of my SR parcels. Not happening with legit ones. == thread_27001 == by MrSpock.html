				I recently ordered two different packages from two different vendors, containing two completely different items. One item was semi legal and one was a small amount of weed, so nothing too high profile. I had them sent to my house. They both successfully came, with impeccable and 100% tamper evident packaging that would show if it had been opened. All seals were completely intact. <br /><br />On the front of both packages on the address label, there is the number 3 circled. It&#039;s written in blue pen. It&#039;s really sketching me out since I&#039;ve never seen this done with any of my mail. Should I change my ship address?<br /><br />

				If I had to guess, id say they were sorted in some pile that was &quot;3&quot; or for route &quot;3&quot; or postman &quot;3&quot; or something like that. I could of course be very wrong.

				Actually been thinking abut this, if it had &quot;4&quot; on it, youd want to worry, and if it had &quot;5&quot; really worry but &quot;3&quot; is cool.

				I suppose some of the content of those packages may cause paranoia?<br /><br />As people said, 3 is okay though. This number is your suspect score, and will increase if you order more packages. Once it reaches 6 you should really make a run for it, since at 7 police usually raids your home. <br /><br />The mailman marking bins is, however, also plausible :D
