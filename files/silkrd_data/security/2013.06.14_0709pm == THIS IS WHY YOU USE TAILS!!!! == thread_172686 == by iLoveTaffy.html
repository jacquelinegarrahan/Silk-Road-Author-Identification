				One of my drop locations was just busted and a laptop confiscated. I have NO IDEA how it happened, but whatever. There&#039;s absolutely NOTHING on that junk laptop. There&#039;s nothing to find, nothing at the location, and they just wasted a great bust.<br /><br />See, people? This is why you use Tails. If that laptop was loaded with SR goodness, guess what would&#039;ve happened? Shit would&#039;ve gone down. I&#039;m fine, nothing connects me to that property, but you think I want a drop location that *I* use connected to Silk Road? No! Not at all. None of us do.<br /><br />This should be a HUGE eye opener for you all. If you protect your shit, you will be PERFECTLY fine. Felonies are being committed here!

				I think that is not a good idea to post that one of your drop locations has been compromised. I don&#039;t know if the feds reads all the posts in this forum, but if the wrong eyes reads this, it can be a problem for you.

				It&#039;s fine, do not worry. I&#039;m not connected to the drop in any way. I&#039;m perfectly fine. I worded it perfectly to avoid ANY detection, trust me. :)<br /><br />Just take it as a warning, folks.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172686.msg1237606#msg1237606">Quote from: wiggum on June 14, 2013, 07:21 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can you give any info on how the bust happened?&nbsp; They actually searched the place?<br /><br />Without giving away any identifying info of course 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep.

				I&#039;m curious why that location was busted if you have nothing there? What made them want to bust &#039;that&#039; location?<br /><br />I used to use a laptop but now use tails. I did a 3 pass wipe and truecrypt on my laptop once I switched to tails since there is some of my past use of SR on the laptop. <br /><br />Do you think this is enough to cover up the files from when I used my laptop before for SR?

But if you&#039;re high-level, then no. Destroy the drive beyond recovery and buy a new one. That&#039;s the best you can do.<br /><br />LE will not put the effort into recovering files for a gram, felony or not. But you never know, so it&#039;s really up to you.<br /><br />I really can&#039;t say more, except that I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because I had a lot of deliveries there. They were just unlucky and found nothing.

				Nothing beats a tiny USB with tails, that not only can you use any computer you come across, but at the first itch of trouble, just pull it out of the USB and the computer automatically shuts down. <br /><br />

ANYONE can do this, minus having multiple drop locations. Simple protection of your data and all you get is minor drug charges if you&#039;re caught. Yet if you get caught with Silk Road and have deliveries... there&#039;s no such thing as plausible deniability at that point.

But these tutorials are excellent.
