				Okay, so you know how you can play a [slightly modified version of] &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; on your phone using only the digits {1, 2, 3}?<br /><br />&quot;3212333222333...&quot;<br /><br />You can use other combinations of digits too ({4, 8, #}, for example), but the nature of your phone&#039;s dual-tone multi-frequency signaling only allows you to play melodies with up to three unique notes- four if you go vertical. Not a lot of possibilities there.<br /><br />But look at the keyboard in front of you: you&#039;ve got not three, not four, but ten digits lined up in a neat little row. Unlike the buttons on your phone, your computer keyboard doesn&#039;t produce audible pitches, but use your imagination. Let each digit correspond to one scale degree (â‰ˆ one note) and you can &quot;play&quot; a melody with as wide a range as the US national anthem:<br /><br />&quot;531358098345...&quot;<br /><br />Or the first verse of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;33123333454322345432<br />333576668888864322...&quot;<br /><br />Or Maurice Ravel&#039;s &quot;Ondine&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;75356753567608543514351348...&quot;<br /><br />Sequences of numbers (or letters, or symbols) derived from music are ideal for padding out passwords, because: <br />1) they&#039;re long<br />2) they&#039;re easy to memorize<br />3) they&#039;re unlikely to be found in a brute force attack dictionary (especially if the source music is obscure- hipsters have a distinct advantage here), and<br />4) they&#039;re actually kind of fun to type in.<br /><br />Do with this what you will!

				Sounds neat :)<br />Could you explain this a little further? I don&#039;t fully understand this.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lovely thought though. &quot;Darn it, what was my password again? Where&#039;s my guitar?&quot; :)<br /><br />cheers

Which notes get which characters would be entirely up to you, as long as it makes sense to you and you won&#039;t forget your system.<br /><br />So let&#039;s say A = 1, B = 2, C = 3. Then &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot;- that duet that everybody plays on piano and goes like this:<br /><br />&quot;CCCCBABCDEEEEDCDEFGCAGFEDC&quot;<br /><br />...and would translate to:<br /><br />&quot;33332123455554345673876543&quot;<br /><br />You could then- *ahem*- &quot;transpose it down a key&quot; and get something like:<br /><br />&quot;EEEEWQWERTTTTRERTYUEIUYTRE&quot;<br /><br />Lots of options, lots of melodies. (I keep saying melodies because it&#039;s easy to think of examples, but any musical figure will do: bass lines, arpeggiations of a chord progression, guitar solos- anything you&#039;re able to remember.)

				Patterns should be avoided when possible. They don&#039;t totally fuck you but they require you to remember more. There is absolutely no reason to remember a 50 character truly random password, anything more than 39 truly randomly generated ASCII characters is a waste of your memory since that is equal to a 256 bit random key which is what AES-256 uses anyway.

				Music does not always use logical patterns, so I don&#039;t see the problem here. If you use Mozart, Bach etc, it&#039;s a different story since they quite strictly apply music theory which is an easy pattern to figure out.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and &#039;transpose&#039; some dissonant arpreggios into a password tomorrow.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Edit: I forgot to thank you for your further explaination, Leapfrogger! As this happens to be my 100th post, you&#039;ll get my first Karma :)
