				Title: <strong>Silk Road escrow: Where is it stored?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				When a buyer makes a purchase, the funds are held in escrow. Are these escrowed bitcoins sent to a &quot;holding wallet&quot; on SR servers, or are these funds kept in the buyer&#039;s eWallet and managed by SR database logic?<br /><br />If the escrowed bitcoins are transferred to a &quot;holding wallet&quot; then isn&#039;t most, or any, tumbling/laundry you do is fundamentally flawed in that they can always be traced back to this same wallet?<br /><br />If the escrowed bitcoins are, in fact, kept in the buyer&#039;s eWallet and managed by a Silk Road &quot;escrow database&quot; (or some kind of escrow logic that doesn&#039;t involve actually transferring these coins /out/ of the buyer&#039;s wallet) then there is no central link to which laundered bitcoins can be traced.<br /><br />Is my thinking correct on this issue? Any senior members, or Silk Road him/her -self, have input on this thought?

				This is pure speculation. I think that the bitcoins are only put there as an IOU. No real bitcoins are transferred anywhere until the escrow is paid out. That&#039;s when the everything happens. So, when it gives you a dollar amount its just that an amount that is locked in. Because escrow isn&#039;t done til the transaction is done, the amount in bitcoins could go up or down..At least, that&#039;s my take on it...<br /><br />So, all the bitcoins are just stored in a secure place. No matter how you get your bitcoins on SR I believe it always go through the tumbler somehow...(At least that is my theory and my hope)..

				So affectively SR is one big wallet? It&#039;s also a mixer/tumbler in that case, right?<br /><br />P.S. I hope SR admins gave handed their wallet to the Wallet Verifier : http://3woapc2khixooeit.onion/<br />

				If SR is not dumb, Sr has more than one wallet. SR probably controls a network of wallets to tumble, ditching old wallets and adding new ones all the time. Not sure if SR would tumble though 3rd party exchanges or not. Your BTC are probably just bouncing around while SR&#039;s codebase credits your account. Your coins get actually tumbled to/from your throwaway wallet when you cash out/in.
