				So I have been having an extremely frustrating time trying to install Liberte on a USB drive. After doing some reading, I have read that my specific type of netbook has trouble running it, and I would have to do quite a bit of configuring to gain success. So I devised this temporary solution, let me know what you guys think, if you see any flaws etc:<br />-Run Tor Browser Bundle<br />-Use PGP encryprion<br />-Make Purchase<br />-Erase Hard Drive<br />I no longer use this netbook as it is my old machine and so I have no problem with erasing the hard drive. Remember this is only a temporary solution until I can figure out Liberte.<br />Also, what is the most recommended way of aquiring bitcoins right now, bitcopia? If so, should access bitcopia through TOR?

				That sounds like a good idea. Disk encryption will only be a concern to me after I have wiped this harddrive of info, and then I will download linux..&nbsp; But for the time being, if I make a single purchase this way, do you believe I am still completely anonymous?<br /><br />fuckoffehbuddy - thanks haha

				Thanks fuckoffehbuddy! Anyone else thoughts on this?<br /><br />I&#039;ve also noticed a couple of threads with people being worried about man in the middle attacks... How can one protect themselves from this? I&#039;ve read about about validating your downloads and checking their certifications/signatures but that whole process is a little foreign to me? Any advice on how to protect yourself from these attacks? How can I be sure I&#039;m not involved in one now etc.

				Don&#039;t worry too awful much about making one purchase.&nbsp; Your chances of getting pinched go up the more transactions you do.&nbsp; If you are just making a purchase for personal use yes you will be fine with a fresh install - that means erase the disk FIRST, install the OS, do your business, and then you can reinstall again to be extra safe.&nbsp; A fresh install of the OS is the best way to make sure you are not already compromised, which is actually more likely than you might suspect.

				Have you tried TAILS?&nbsp; https://tails.boum.org/&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I like liberte with the data persistence and all, but ended up going back to tails, since it kept me honest: everything in &#039;the cloud&#039; somewhere, especially my bookmarks, as everything disappears as soon as I&quot;m offline...and it&#039;s worked off my thumb drive on every type of computer here, netbooks to desktop...just found a good place to store stuff I needed whenever I&#039;d boot up, but I liked it, longer I used it...<br /><br />But other than that, sounds like you&#039;re well covered...I don&#039;t know about other people, but&nbsp; I tend to get complacent (lazy) and not as careful as I once was..had to reflect a little on it, and how important was I, really, in the scheme of things, did I really think LE was going to do all these things?&nbsp; But anyway, we all have to measure our own comfort in this area...I like fiddling with stuff, so I tried all kinds of stuff, from privatix to virtual machines ... somewhere in here, it&#039;s been about a year now, but somebody did a real nice tutorial on putting together a vm that was really cool for tor activities...how to set it up just right...so there&#039;s plenty of options, depending on how far you want to go with it...<br /><br />I ended up using the lightweight linux distro xpud too, real barebones linux, similar to my chrome OS, but strictly linux....best wishes on this, again check out some of those early Security thread stuff, you get bored :)
