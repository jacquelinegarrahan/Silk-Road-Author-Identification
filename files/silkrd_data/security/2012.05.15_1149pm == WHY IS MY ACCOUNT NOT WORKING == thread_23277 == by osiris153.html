				i made my buyers account 4 months ago, around the same time i made this forum account, and i have spent over 8000 dollars on this website. i just recently made a move to the UK and had put a decently large sum of money on my account before i left so i could purchase some marijuana so i wouldnt be stuck without it when i got here from canada, and once i try and log onto my account when i got here it said my password was invalid?<br /><br />i specifically changed my password before i left and i am absolutely positive i am not forgetting what i changed it to, as i wrote it down and put it in my wallet and had tried to log in several times before i left succesfully with the new password. i use a macintosh, so i am fairly certain i am not very suceptible to key logging and stuff like that, and i have the silk road link memorized so im fairly positive that i would not be a victim of password phishing.<br /><br />has this happened to any of you?and do you think its just a glitch and maybe my account will work tomorrow?<br /><br />i put just under 1k onto my account before i left, and it that is gone, i do not know what i will do....

				How many times did you try to login?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had it happen to me a few times where I swear I put in the correct password, several times, but it just kept coming back to the login, then the next try would work.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest reloading everything, manually typing in the URL if you are using a bookmark, then trying again.<br /><br />If you still cannot get in, send a PM to SR admin and explain everything, hopefully they will be able to help you.

				i sent a 2 PMs to SR admin last night from a new account i created, and when i woke up this morning, they were nowhere to be found in my outbox.... i sent another one today, and still have not gotten a reply to either of my first ones, or this last one. this is starting to seem a little fishy to me.<br /><br />i would really just like to get my account/transactionhistory/money back.... :(

				SR probably stole your coins.&nbsp; It&#039;s been happening a lot and when people report it they get censored and banned from the forums.&nbsp; Been happening to both buyers and vendors.&nbsp; DO NOT LEAVE COINS IN YOUR ACCOUNT. SR = THIEVES.

				i really hope that is not the case, as i have held this website and it&#039;s moderators in very high regard since i first stumbled here about 5 months ago... :(<br /><br />however, i just checked my outbox, and the first 2 messages didnt disapear, i think they were just forwarded to DPR so they wernt showing up in my SR support chat history, so hopefully once he log son and reads those i might be able to get the ball rolling in regard to getting my account back.
