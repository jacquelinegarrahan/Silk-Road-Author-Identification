				I sent sr a message trying to get them to reset my pin that i never set up in the first place!!!!<br /><br />This is the answer they gave me!<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry but the whole point of the PIN is to prevent someone who gets into your account from withdrawing money, so we can&#039;t honor requests for a PIN reset coming from your account. You have about 10 attempts to remember your PIN before it is reset and you are given further instructions.<br />

				Isnt that pin just another password, for withdrawal, not a numerical thing like credit cards have? System asked for that like 2 weeks ago.

				I imagine that if it has been reset then the next step would be to create a new PIN and remember it this time!!<br /><br />8)

				lol the pin shit does suck. It was put in place because idiots were getting fished and now the same idiots are forgetting their pins. Stupidity cannot be outlawed or curtailed with rules. Thats an original quote.

				The same thing happened to me. I was confused because I read &quot;pin&quot; not &quot;second password&quot;, which is how the announcement and prompt for such was worded.<br /><br />My document I kept the password on was deleted. Idiotic on my part, sure. But I&#039;ve never had my account hacked. <br /><br />Lastly, the &quot;further instructions&quot; which SR Support gave in their generic response it appears they&#039;re telling everyone were not given. It just reads that the pin has been reset. Period.

				Another reason to use an application like password safe to ensure all passwords are different and random and secured... I never have to worry about what password I set for what because it&#039;s all secured in a little truecrypted volume stored safely online and encrypted so even if my computer died tomorrow, or I had to ditch the thumbdrive I use in 2 hours I can have another loaded up and have the passwords for everything and be back online no problem.
