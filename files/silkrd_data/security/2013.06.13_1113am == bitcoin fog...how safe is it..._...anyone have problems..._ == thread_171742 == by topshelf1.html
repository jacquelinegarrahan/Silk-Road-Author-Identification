				I&#039;ve personally used it a dozen times, and hasn&#039;t been a single problem. <br />I slowly funnel money into it from two-three sources, then if it&#039;s big enough, straight into SR over time intervals. <br /><br />

				Why are you doing that? Do you know about this?<br /><br />Take 2 pennies, drop them into a jar of 10,000 pennies.<br />Shake Jar.<br />Remove 2 pennies.<br />Did you remove the same exact 2 pennies? Probably not.<br /><br />You can just make a Free Wallet at www.blockchain.com.<br />Send all your BTC to that Fresh wallet.<br />Make another Free Wallet at www.blockchain.com<br />Send the BTC there also....<br />Do you still have the Same Exact BTC?

				Hash.thanks for your thoughts...<br /><br />I considered doing something along those lines...I have several blockchain wallets...all registered through tor of course...(even though the blockchain servers are on the clearnet...)<br /><br />I suppose you could mix things up doing it that way and it would make it somewhat harder to trace back...<br /><br />HOWEVER...being new to this game...I like the fact that the bitcoin fog service is on the tor network...<br /><br />The way I see it...the vulnerability of bitcoin is getting in and out...I took care to purchase anonymously...and then transferred out to a couple of different wallets...before deleting the original account through which I made the original purchase...<br /><br />but before transferring coin to SR...I wanted to cover up the trail as much as possible...<br /><br />I think mathematically the advantage of fog...over the DIY method you describe...is that they have a lot more transactions going on...and a lot more accounts...so when you throw pennies in the &quot;jar&quot;.... or pool as they call it...the sheer number of transactions (and accounts) makes it MUCH more difficult to put the pieces together...<br /><br />Although I am not convinced it is impossible...math is a very powerful tool...it would be an interesting challenge to piece things together the way fog does it...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...

				One flaw is that if you use two different mixing accounts to mix two different sets of money that are meant to be kept seperate, they will sometimes be linked to each other.<br /><br />It is a good service if you want to hide the original of a single cash source, but do not try to manage multiple seperate identities through them.<br /><br />The other side effect of such a mixing service is that you will also be assoiciated with everyone else using the service.

				@ St Exo...<br /><br />I agree with you..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why you put me in with Hash on thinking the DIY mixing method is safe...I never said that...and that is why I went through bitcoin fog...<br /><br />It did not take me long to learn that the blockchain info is public...and that even if you try to mix your coin through several different wallets...it could be pieced together fairly easily...<br /><br />I am having a very smooth experience with fog...and I absolutely think that anyone (vendor or buyer) who cares about anonymity should use it...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper<br />

Some of these coin tumblers may even be run by LEO for data crunching purposes! If you are careful to buy your BTC anonymously with cash, I see no reason whatsoever how sending directly to your SR wallet could be a security risk at all. LEO will look at the blockchain and perhaps see obviously that your coins went to SR, but so what, as long as your real identity is not associated with the coins you are totally safe. People who need to cash out of BTC back to gov&#039;t dollars are in a different boat, but I would still feel much better just selling my BTC for cash, maybe through localbitcoins.com or craigslist or as an SR bitcoin seller. <br /><br />I think using a mixing service with coins that can be traced back to you is a lot like openly using Tor, GPG, BTC, and hidden services in public, like posting about these things on social networks or using them at a coffee shop or whatever. Sure, these are awesome tools for keeping your activities hidden, but it also broadcasts to anyone paying attention that you have something to hide. (If you have something to hide, keep that fact itself hidden as well!) If you cash out with tumbled coins, it *should* be totally obscured where they came from, but it will be totally obvious that you got them doing something shady. We aren&#039;t trying to protect ourselves from the smoking gun piece of evidence, we need to protect ourselves from all the small, legal but suspicious things that could trigger an investigation.

				@radi8power...<br /><br />those are good points too...<br /><br />I covered myself by buying the coin for cash from a local seller...completely anonymously...<br /><br />I thought about going straight to SR...but took the advice of a moderator...who clearly knows more than I do...<br /><br />Scary thought that bitcoin fog could be run by LEO...but I would not discount that...in light of what we are hearing recently...they are EVERYWHERE...<br /><br />If there is one thing that I take away from this experience so far...it is to exercise extreme caution getting into and out of coin...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper

				Any opinions on the &quot;shared send&quot; and &quot;shared receive&quot; features on blockchain.info compared to BTC Fog?&nbsp; Any reason why one is better than the other?<br /><br />The &quot;taint analysis&quot; and transaction tree graphs available on blockchain.info are eye-opening if you think just sending from wallet to wallet to wallet is enough to hide the source of bitcoins.

The argument for &quot;bitcoins being legal and for authorities to investigate your transaction history would necessarily entail that they&#039;ve boned you somewhere else along the line&quot; isn&#039;t valid for me. I think a lot of the time police will follow money when they can&#039;t prove dealing otherwise. In fact, if this is the argument then why not withdraw directly from SR to blockchain.net, because as long as you&#039;re careful with your dealing they shouldn&#039;t have any reason to investigate your blockchain in the first place.<br /><br />Of course I would use caution in withdrawing money, and there are other techniques mentioned in the forum. I&#039;m just not convinced with your argument about the fog being so public that it holds legitimate users. In facebook the legitimate users far exceed the drug dealers and this cannot be equated to bitfog; I see no reason why someone would use bitfog if they&#039;re not doing something illegal. Even if there is one person out of a hundred that are legitmate then it&#039;s not good enough.<br /><br />Personally I would seek other methods. Just my opinion though and I respect the intentions of bitfog and I agree that we are winning the war against authorities. We need to proceed with caution at every point and doubt the services that we trust at every corner.

Therefore - by the time law enforcement have enough evidence to bring a case against you, you would already be in substantial troubles and the mixing service is only a footnote to the real story to the courts.<br /><br />In my experience of laundering money, cases do not succeed in court when the only prima facie case is against a person attempting to conceal items when not under legal obligation to disclose them (ie in the normal course of a regulated trade or an established business). When it does become reason to investigate you is at the point you will already be in a problematic situation such as intercepted bulk shipments which even then, the case won&#039;t have a high success rate, if any at all if it depends on the factor that a mixing service was employed by the person in question.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Still, being &quot;mixed in&quot; with child pornographers, high-level crime cyndicates and darker entities is a rather scary thought, compared to something as &quot;public&quot; and openly received as Facebook. Sure, drug deals are being done, but not nearly as many as legitimate activities. Whereas with Fog, the chances of you mixing in with an illegitimate source is highly likely.<br /><br />It&#039;s the nature of anonymity. Simple as that. Don&#039;t do what is &quot;to be expected&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Seconded. The argument for &quot;bitcoins being legal and for authorities to investigate your transaction history would necessarily entail that they&#039;ve boned you somewhere else along the line&quot; isn&#039;t valid for me. I think a lot of the time police will follow money when they can&#039;t prove dealing otherwise. In fact, if this is the argument then why not withdraw directly from SR to blockchain.net, because as long as you&#039;re careful with your dealing they shouldn&#039;t have any reason to investigate your blockchain in the first place.<br /><br />Of course I would use caution in withdrawing money, and there are other techniques mentioned in the forum. I&#039;m just not convinced with your argument about the fog being so public that it holds legitimate users. In facebook the legitimate users far exceed the drug dealers and this cannot be equated to bitfog; I see no reason why someone would use bitfog if they&#039;re not doing something illegal. Even if there is one person out of a hundred that are legitmate then it&#039;s not good enough.<br /><br />Personally I would seek other methods. Just my opinion though and I respect the intentions of bitfog and I agree that we are winning the war against authorities. We need to proceed with caution at every point and doubt the services that we trust at every corner.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This. This. This<br /><br />It&#039;s so important that we have a HUGE plethora of options at our disposal. Sure. StExo uses Fog, and good for him. We NEED people using that, to keep away from what WE are using. The more people who use different &quot;mixing&quot; services or &quot;less obvious&quot; means of transferring funds to SR the better.<br /><br />So, in no way do I condone the usage of it, I just never will use it myself. More power to the people who DO use it though; as we need them. Just be smart, use what works for YOU, and don&#039;t do anything dumb (leads back to the &quot;be smart&quot; comment...)<br /><br />Good luck, guys. I&#039;m heading off for the day.
