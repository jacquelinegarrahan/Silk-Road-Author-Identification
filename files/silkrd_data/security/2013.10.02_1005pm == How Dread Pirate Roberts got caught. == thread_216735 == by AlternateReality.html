				This is the guy that seriously started all this???<br /><br />In one of the articles I read it says, it may have not been him who is the original DPR.<br /><br />That would make sense why he made such a stupid mistake or mistakes.&nbsp; Damn.

				according to that though, they got the original DPR. if you&#039;ve been here a while, you would know that thats not the current DPR. i expect it to be back up in a few days on one of the other site address :)

				He may have been peddling a phony story to Forbes magazine to cover his tracks when he first started (orig DPR) and left lot&#039;s of mistakes around like reusing identities to shill this board.<br /><br />Or the feds are retards and he did buy the site out from the first guy.<br /><br />They didn&#039;t do any magical Tor circumventing tricks to get him. he literally talked and half-assed his way into jail.

The more interesting thing is, I just got through reading his Linkedin profile, and the way he writes there sounds way more like the original DPR than the guy who has been running the show as of late. Here&#039;s the quote, and a link to his profile:<br /><br />http://www.linkedin.com/in/rossulbricht<br /><br />&quot;I love learning and using theoretical constructs to better understand the world around me. Naturally therefore, I studied physics in college and worked as a research scientist for five years. I published my findings in peer reviewed journals five times over that period, first on organic solar cells and then on EuO thin-film crystals. My goal during this period of my life was simply to expand the frontier of human knowledge.<br /><br />Now, my goals have shifted. I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind. Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.&quot;

				taking a fall for something of the magnitude and audacity like SR is no simple slap on the wrist, be it a patsy or not. Mandatory minimums and conspiracy/RICO charges will put this guy away from 40-50 years at least with mandatory minimums alone, even if he gave them all the info he knows... He&#039;ll crack, just like everyone else does... The Feds have a phenomenal conviction rates across the board, as they are patient, gather evidence, and strike once they got you dead to rights. Try sitting across a table in a purposely confining interrogation room, from a guy(s) who&#039;s job it is to terrify people into submission saying &quot; You&#039;re looking at doing the rest of your life in a federal prison, do you think any of your &quot;friends&quot; are gonna take that sacrifice for you?&quot; Someone will talk...

				Well ain&#039;t this a kick in the head :(<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s pretty conclusive that 1) the guy they caught is indeed DPR and 2) he&#039;s the only SR DPR there ever was. If I had to guess, I&#039;d say the story about a second DPR was meant to be some sort of ruse he concocted to perhaps distance himself from the fatal security lapses which connected his true identity to SR&#039;s original launch as well as its ongoing operation.<br /><br />This is really sad news. I shudder to think what he&#039;s going through now that the federal oinkers have kidnapped him and locked him in a cage somewhere. I truly hope he somehow manages to beat this or escape or something.
