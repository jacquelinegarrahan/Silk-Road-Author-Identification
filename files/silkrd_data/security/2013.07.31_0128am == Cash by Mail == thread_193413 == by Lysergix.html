				So have recently started doing cash by mail, so far so good. But i got a postal service error this time saying &quot;Canada Post processing error; item re-routed. Possible delay&quot;<br /><br />Any ideas? It was supposed to be next day delivery, aaaand today is the next day and its still in my city. I checked the address and everything is properly written(although, i did write the to name in the from coloumn and had to scratch it out.... dont see why that would cause an issue. <br /><br />I am kind of worried that a postal worker took the cash... It was wrapped in mylar and placed into the xpresspost envelope.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />A quick google search brings up the usual cash in the mail warnings, but considering how many people buy BTC via cash in the mail i figured that that is a little bit of public paranoia?

				I hope you at least partially disguised it from the outside... as in made it not feel like cash. Sending cash is not illegal persay but that wouldn&#039;t stop a greedy post man who just happened to &quot;lose&quot; the package.

				Its wrapped in mylar heat seal foil, which itself didn&#039;t feel like cash. It is also in an express post envelope which is pretty firm cardboard. Would be kind of surprised if a post office worker took it out, cut the foil with scissors and took the money. But i guess that could happen...

				How much money was it? It doesn&#039;t nessisarily have to feel like money but if the buldge is in the shape of money then that&#039;s a different story...

				Luckily was a test run so was &lt;$500, but would still rather not lose it...<br /><br />I realize nobody here is handling my package but maybe people have found themselves in the same situation.
