				I havenâ€™t been able to access it all morning. I was also unable to browse their forums. Tried to place a modest first order last week, but it was kicked back with no communication. When I transferred my coins back out, I paid a 0.30049 BTC fee for a transfer of 15 BTC. Got me thinking that part of their commission structure might be these external transfer fees. Too damned much to whack a buyer with it.

				Dumb question: I checked out BMR a couple days ago and it just seemed like an inferior SR copycat with less goods, except maybe the violent ones I guess. So what is the need? Just curious...

It&#039;s still MUCH smaller than SR, yeah, but there are a few good sellers there.<br /><br />At BMR there is no upfront fee to open a seller account. That means most of the listings probably are scammers, but also people can afford to bring small quantities to the market. I have found some great deals at BMR, and their escrow system worked out just fine for me in the two transactions that didn&#039;t go anywhere.

				BMR seems like it&#039;s a bit of a pain getting around and how the layout is (at least for me). and it does look like there are a lot of scammers there. like you would have to be waaaay more careful if you were shopping from there.

				BMR was not accessible for a while yesterday, but it&#039;s back up and running.<br /><br />yes, you always have to be careful dealing in the deep web. but BMR got a good escrow system, and as long as you stay in escrow, there shouldn&#039;t be too many problems. BMR got a lot of cool features SR doesn&#039;t have, but of course SR got a much bigger user base than BMR.<br /><br />BMR is great for people who want to start selling goods and aren&#039;t sure if the investment is worth it. it&#039;s also great for people selling cheap products. and as it doesn&#039;t cost BTC to create a vendor account, it doesn&#039;t hurt to list your products both on SR/TA and on BMR.<br /><br />as for layout, that&#039;s always a matter of taste. some users may prefer SR, some may prefer BMR, but most won&#039;t care too much and probably use both.
