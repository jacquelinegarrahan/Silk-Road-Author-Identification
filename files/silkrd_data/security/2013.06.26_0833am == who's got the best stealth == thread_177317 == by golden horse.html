				Just wondering who in your opinion has the best stealth packaging you have seen.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t mention anything about techniques, just the vendors names will do.<br /><br />I want to get some ideas, some inspiration to improve my own, not copy, thats not my style, i&#039;m not a plagerist, but I would like to see a few techniques being used so I can formulate my own.<br /><br />You have to be original because u need to keep changing it regulary, i&#039;m quite creative so that won&#039;t be a problem, just need to get an idea on the best materials and methods etc.

				I have two threads up for this:<br /><br />Internal Stealth Packaging: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175130.msg1258047<br />External Stealth Packaging: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175305.msg1258714<br /><br />However no one is posting as the majority seems to think this information should stay classified, even when no vendor is mentioned by name. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just wondering who in your opinion has the best stealth packaging you have seen.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t mention anything about techniques, just the vendors names will do.<br /><br />I want to get some ideas, some inspiration to improve my own, not copy, thats not my style, i&#039;m not a plagerist, but I would like to see a few techniques being used so I can formulate my own.<br /><br />You have to be original because u need to keep changing it regulary, i&#039;m quite creative so that won&#039;t be a problem, just need to get an idea on the best materials and methods etc.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So basically what you&#039;re saying is you want to know a vendor with good stealth, order from said vendor and then take note of said stealth for inspiration - but not help anyone else? This seems to be the normal way of doing things here on Silk Road but I simply do not understand this mindset of keeping absolutely everything secret and inventing the wheel over and over again when we could have the possibility of actually improving the wheel as a group.&nbsp; :-\

What matters is how the Customs Agencies operate, how much staff is present at the day of the mail going through and how many packages they decide to inspect at random. Some countries won&#039;t inspect a package at all unless a drug dog indicates it or they know something major is coming, while other countries like Sweden will open packages randomly based most likely on profiling and patterns. I personally think the key to getting ahead is to fully understand what the Customs Operator on the ground is looking for when a package is being picked seemingly at random. Here is a case where keeping everything secret is very effective though, but unlike vendors on Silk Road Customs Agencies are large organizations that have to follow rules and guidelines which makes them weak in comparison to our potential adaptability.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It pays to be smart, think these things through and even be a little paranoid.<br /><br />For all of you who see no harm in this type of thread; imagine you were a vendor.

Now if we&#039;re talking Internal Stealth, which is the scope of this thread and the majority of others it would make no difference whatsoever to the vendor itself as his risk has been eliminated the second he posts the package. A customer might possibly in your scenario get a slightly higher risk of getting his package intercepted if Customs has so little to do that they have time to inspect every single package through spectrometry, but again if this happens there&#039;s bigger issues at hand than individual stealth packaging.

				No the OP sound like an aspiring vendor that describes himself as creative but cannot create an idea of stealth. So he wants to grab them from others. But this is not the way to do it, because if someone tells you its stealth well it is a shitty stealth because who knows who else he will have told it to ? From the second a stealth is openly discusses it ceases to be stealth and become a flag. This is what every vendor should have in mind.<br /><br />But I have an advice for you : wait for it to come to your mind. It will if it have to. Because your craving for stealth is always somewhere on your mind - I know: I&#039;ve been there - so you will put every object, paper, wrapping you see from sunrise to sunset in the perspective of an stealth method and eventually you will find YOUR idea for stealth.<br /><br />And this will be a good stealth because it will be unique, meaning not already seen by any custom officer in the world. Provided you are inventive enough because the CD case as a stash really is plain shit. The only thing making these arriving to their destination is the big number of this type of package mailed every day but this stash still equals drugs in every custom officer mind.<br /><br /><br /><br />Burning Babylon on another hand sounds like a cop. This paragraph especially : <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />More like -1 for Customs Agencies as they have yet another method they have to inform to their operators on the ground, especially if there&#039;s a risk they&#039;re opening a legit package which might generate bad press for them.

Guys ? ... &quot;<br />No dumbfuck, they will be thrilled to learn about a new method, it their only source of proud !!! Intercepting illegal stuff !<br /><br />And, +1 for the community ??? &quot;Oh swell, I a have to find an all new stealthing package because the one that I have been working on for weeks and actually investing money in all these 500 fleshlights + sperm-like lube to stash my drugs in has been talked about on the forum ! Ah ah the naughty boys, it is so fun I have do it all again, but I don&#039;t mind because I am an &quot;artist&quot; at this, I like when people flatter my ego and tell that the ones that would intercept packages won&#039;t do it because it too exhausting to learn a new stealth method, meaning the person makes me underestimate them, I like it very much and he sure does not look like a cop trying to nail me, just a fellow nice guy that take all of his time writing long posts on unveiling stealth methods ! Haha, swell I can get even better at my stealth now, what an opportunity you gave me, thank you so much ! I only lost 3750$ of fleshlights value but nevermind this will improve my marketilbitleity as the guy who totally does not look like a cop said !&quot;<br />(Yeah, I do good impersonation...) <br />(...) -.-<br /><br />The truth is once you have a good stealth you don&#039;t have to change it because if it&#039;s good it&#039;s good. The more you change it, the more you will be traceable with all the buys you have to do to get your containing boxes for drugs and etc... <br /><br />I don&#039;t care how little is the threat about posting tips on stealth, even a 0.00001% should be avoided if it can be. <br /><br />The only thing you sould be allowed to say is what is said in the official buyer&#039;s that is printed labels, professional look and if you open it you don&#039;t know what is inside. This is the only thing to know.<br />After, countries work along so many different lines that it is useless to even try to do the inventory here. Oh it would be sweet to know which cutom have x-ray, how will they use it, okay this is good information. But after that sellers do their on work to get around these screening technics. No specific advice should be given by anyone to anywho.<br /><br /><br />Also, I am sorry Burning Babylon, you were quite good at your game. I&#039;ve always pictured myself cops as dumber that this but you actually did well. Your nametag, very wise, trying to play with us and all, no really that&#039;s good. You have no shame to feel and I have nothing against you, you just picked the wrong team, the one who will always lose. Of course you think the opposite of that but this is because you only see the fishes you caught and put in the sunlight of your boat deck. Also you can see the other small fish that almost got, or will get, or at least hurt a little.<br />But my friend, deep down there, there are the big beasts of the legends, those that you can&#039;t ever imagine in your wildest dreams. And they are thriving. Their teeth are huge, and their mind are strong as steel. So quick quick, Officer Barbrady, change your team, we are open to you, you even will be very useful but please leave the ship. Because we will Burn Babylon.

				Tessellated has the best stealth I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; But of course that was LSD so it allows for a bit more flexibility.<br /><br />The other packaging I have seen that has been very stealthy always appears to come from a business that might send something very similar to whatever it is that I am ordering.

Also you can see the other small fish that almost got, or will get, or at least hurt a little.<br />But my friend, deep down there, there are the big beasts of the legends, those that you can&#039;t ever imagine in your wildest dreams. And they are thriving. Their teeth are huge, and their mind are strong as steel. So quick quick, Officer Barbrady, change your team, we are open to you, you even will be very useful but please leave the ship. Because we will Burn Babylon.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /><br />I was about to compose a long and involved reply to Burning Babylon and you have done half the job for me.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No the OP sound like an aspiring vendor that describes himself as creative but cannot create an idea of stealth. So he wants to grab them from others. But this is not the way to do it, because if someone tells you its stealth well it is a shitty stealth because who knows who else he will have told it to ? From the second a stealth is openly discusses it ceases to be stealth and become a flag. This is what every vendor should have in mind.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would be very interested on hearing your perspective on how Customs Operators are working on the ground, detail every step if possible on how they profile specific packages based on what the contents are which they somehow mysteriously can tell is inside them because every Customs Operator sits 24/7 reading these threads. If your country is profiled and the package is opened at random the only thing that is going to save the package is an incompetent and/or lazy Customs Operator, and luckily there seems to be a lot of them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And this will be a good stealth because it will be unique, meaning not already seen by any custom officer in the world. Provided you are inventive enough because the CD case as a stash really is plain shit. The only thing making these arriving to their destination is the big number of this type of package mailed every day but this stash still equals drugs in every custom officer mind.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What a load of drivel, but if this is truly what you believe I will not attempt to change your mind on this matter. As soon as everyone has found their unique stealth methods which are secret forever, we will have no more Customs Seizures.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What is that non-sense saying that discovering a new stealth is a bad thing for custom ? &quot;Oh my the poor ones, they are going to have to send a mail to every one in the Custom Office, oh my god the poor ones it is so sad, so much more work too, man I wish drug dealers kept their methods secret, this way we would not be suspicious of any package except the well-know CD case that we learned at the Custom Officer School, right guys ? Guys ? ... &quot;<br />No dumbfuck, they will be thrilled to learn about a new method, it their only source of proud !!! Intercepting illegal stuff !</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your assuming the agencies operate under a scenario where they have perfect information control, meaning they have the ability to exactly pinpoint specific types of packaging to specific countries/vendors and based on that open packages from those countries/vendors. Your point is valid if they&#039;re able to link specific vendors to specific methods, but as to how they would be able to do that I would be very interested in hearing? If a method gets added to a list which has 1000+ listings already, what makes you think it&#039;s not been on that list for 40 years already?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And, +1 for the community ??? &quot;Oh swell, I a have to find an all new stealthing package because the one that I have been working on for weeks and actually investing money in all these 500 fleshlights + sperm-like lube to stash my drugs in has been talked about on the forum ! Ah ah the naughty boys, it is so fun I have do it all again, but I don&#039;t mind because I am an &quot;artist&quot; at this, I like when people flatter my ego and tell that the ones that would intercept packages won&#039;t do it because it too exhausting to learn a new stealth method, meaning the person makes me underestimate them, I like it very much and he sure does not look like a cop trying to nail me, just a fellow nice guy that take all of his time writing long posts on unveiling stealth methods ! Haha, swell I can get even better at my stealth now, what an opportunity you gave me, thank you so much ! I only lost 3750$ of fleshlights value but nevermind this will improve my marketilbitleity as the guy who totally does not look like a cop said !&quot;<br />(Yeah, I do good impersonation...)<br />(...) -.-</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />wat&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The truth is once you have a good stealth you don&#039;t have to change it because if it&#039;s good it&#039;s good. The more you change it, the more you will be traceable with all the buys you have to do to get your containing boxes for drugs and etc...<br /><br />I don&#039;t care how little is the threat about posting tips on stealth, even a 0.00001% should be avoided if it can be.<br /><br />The only thing you sould be allowed to say is what is said in the official buyer&#039;s that is printed labels, professional look and if you open it you don&#039;t know what is inside. This is the only thing to know.<br />After, countries work along so many different lines that it is useless to even try to do the inventory here. Oh it would be sweet to know which cutom have x-ray, how will they use it, okay this is good information. But after that sellers do their on work to get around these screening technics. No specific advice should be given by anyone to anywho.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So you&#039;re saying not only should we keep the information secret internally, we should go to every length to keep any insider information from Law Enforcement/Customs Agencies/Postal Services secret as well? That&#039;s an opinion I don&#039;t agree with as threads like Profiling postal package 101 straight from the feds ;): http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18904.0 and Former Postal Inspection Service Intern- Ask me anything: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0 wouldn&#039;t have existed then.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">+1<br /><br />I was about to compose a long and involved reply to Burning Babylon and you have done half the job for me. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If it&#039;s all going to be &quot;Herpa Derpa Burning Babylon Cop keep everything secret&quot; then I&#039;m glad I got spared. It was probably a waste writing this answer in this thread to begin with as I&#039;m not going to convince anyone anyway but the counter points I&#039;ve seen so far stand on very shaky ground in terms of argumentation.<br /><br />If lysergic25 got his will through everything would be censored and everyone would have to research for themselves, if I got my will through everything would be open and everyone would have to improve upon existing methods. Unfortunately neither one of us will ever get to see our vision fulfilled, but one of those two camps will at any moment have the upper hand.&nbsp; :)

Guns, seized drugs, illigal imigrants as slaves, hookers, seized cars and submarines from drug dealers. A lot of things !<br /><br />Of course, they would have to do it unofficially for their own profit and not within the frame of an investigation.<br /><br />Hell, you&#039;ve just put an idea in my mind, what if one of the top 1% of sellers is a cop ? Hahah that would be fun.<br /><br />Cop is the ultimate gansgta : they LEGALLY steal your drugs AND your money, then SELL your drugs, then ARREST the guy they sold your drugs to, then RESELL the drugs, ... Shit, why haven&#039;t I become a cop ?&nbsp; <br />But thinking about it, and being serious now, Governement is the ultimate gansgta doing all the shit I typed in my previous sentence. It has been proved that the CIA used to smuggle and sell cocaine in the 70&#039;s in order to finance their illegal operations, because the money for it cannot appear in national budget. <br />I&#039;m sure they are still doing it, but now with heroin and this is why they stay so long in Afghanistan. Since they are there, heroin production has sky rocketed and the european market has been flooded with heroin.<br /><br />This may well be the reason why governments continue to ban drugs in total contradiction with their duty of protecting their citizen.

It&#039;s like a real name but it&#039;s not, you don&#039;t really know what it means where does it come from and plus it sound malicious. I am proabably the only one thinking that though.<br />Anyone ? Help ? <br /><br /><br />Wait a second.. dreamy niggers. That sounds gay. You is maliciously gay, that is even scarier.
