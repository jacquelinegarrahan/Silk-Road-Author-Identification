				I have yet to get any free (or greatly discounted) samples and am not sure if I ever would.&nbsp; is it really worth the $10 portion of whatever to breach your security with a completely random stranger?&nbsp; what if they are LE, or what if they just send a real sloppy package?&nbsp; what if its some whistle blower who&#039;s compiling big lists SR users&#039; addresses that they can go public with?&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m being paranoid, but these scenarios aren&#039;t all that far-fetched.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />as for the people who are always begging for free samples...can&#039;t tell if its careless, fiendish, or both.

				its not even worth buying small (EX: ordering 1 gram of ganja) let alone accepting a&nbsp; free tiny sample...<br />I agree with you.<br /><br />most (at least months ago) free samples where stupid RCs...R2D2 or whatever<br /><br />Noobs security first

				I think you&#039;re being overly paranoid. LE would be going after vendors first and foremost. A couple of buyers receiving a package with a miniscule amount of substance would present more paperwork than LE would want to deal with.

Some people take this shit too seriously. I was responding to the OP about LE, not to you. Hell, nobody mentioned anything about being flagged by the post office. Regardless of that, the risk of getting flagged is exactly the same whether you order a small/large package. Typically most new vendors have their packaging down pretty well in the first place, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t have become a vendor in the first place without preparation, or intent to scam. From the 2 samples I&#039;ve received so far, packaging was completely inconspicuous. I have 2 more on the way, and I&#039;m not worried one bit.<br /><br />And if calling me a rook or noob helps remedy your insecurities, then by all means. Just don&#039;t get all heated over an opinion.

				In most cases i would agree with you, but over the last few days I helped walk through a perspective vendor in understanding PGP and got a free sample, I certainly built up a relationship with this person (to a degree) and felt confident that I wasn&#039;t walking into the spider&#039;s web so to speak.<br /><br />ggg

I&#039;m not looking to argue with you on this subject, simply giving my opinion on the matter as well as experience.

				But... they&#039;re free drugs<br /><br />seriously though my real concern is not LE but rather if some perversely sick vendor sent a free sample of 2C-x that turns out to be bromo dragonfly or fucking ricin or something or sends PCP laced weed.&nbsp;

				While I generally agree that free samples can be risky, I do feel that some RCs I want to test before I go in on a relatively large amount and samples are the way to go there. It&#039;s been said many times before but I&#039;ll say it again, you have to trust your gut!

				I for one am getting sick of the sample begging.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with paying a small token for a sample.<br />The begging is getting out of hand. -1<br />Most of you begging rarely write a review for the vendor anyhow.<br /><br />I think new vendors offer small samples with a small fee to build a relationship, is just fine.<br />(keeps the kids out, well most)<br />If you think giving free drugs out is a good idea, enjoy, that thought.<br />However anybody who going to write an honest review on your product is willing to pay.<br />You want to stick a 1/2 gram of cherry hash in that order, that&#039;s ok too.<br /><br />The begging, and free samples got to go. IMHO

				Got to admit free samples are a good way for a new vendor to get some reviews out there. Yeah. i&#039;d hate to be the first guinea pig, but being like the 6th or 7th after some reviews are read can&#039;t be bad, lol.<br /><br />Yeah for established vendors any free samples could hurt profits, but hey If they are usually say, a hash guy, and they get a new new connection to some killer weed to branch out, free samples could start a buzz of reviews for them.<br /><br />But I would never bug a vendor for samples ,unless there&#039;s a thread on forums somewhere they would be willing to give free stuff. I occasionally bug vendors for smaller custom amounts, which seems to miss more than hit, heh. What can I say, I am a cheap guy looking for a good bargain for my drugs, lol. Wouldn&#039;t it be cool if SR had like ebay bidding wars for buyers? I know.... only in my dreams.......

				Wow….there is no good answer to this one.&nbsp; I have often wondered why anyone would accept something from a new vendor.&nbsp; It would seem to be the perfect set up for LE.&nbsp; But the point is well made….all of that effort for .2 or .5 g’s?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then to the counter point.&nbsp; If we do not having peeps willing to “test” new vendors, how does one get started vending?&nbsp; Someone has to take the leap of faith…..I guess its just not gonna be me for the limited “reward”.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a great topic that has huge pros/cons to both side.&nbsp; No right answer.&nbsp; Kudos for those willing to take the “risk” and cheers to hoping you will always be “rewarded”.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace all……well all non LE.......f’ them :)<br />

				I occasionally accept samples, though I only ask for them if the vendor is offering in a forum thread.&nbsp; Badgering someone for free drugs is not only cheap, but shameful.<br />Is it dangerous?&nbsp; Hell yeah.&nbsp; Though even scammers will often send good stuff out for sampling to get some good reviews and load their feedback so they can scam the rest of the community - samples, either paid or free, are essential for any new vendors setting up shop.&nbsp; Paid or free, that&#039;s up to the vendor to decide, and we see both represented.<br /><br />I currently don&#039;t plan on signing up for any samples, it&#039;s only an occasional thing, and it&#039;s part of why the road works.&nbsp; Someone has to take that initial leap of faith.&nbsp; The way I look at it, if I accept a 1g sample of hash/weed or a single hit of acid, the man is NOT going to knock my door down.<br /><br />If nothing ever arrives, I look at it as a possible LE address harvesting scheme and will burn that address, never to be used again.&nbsp; I have only NOT received one order in my time here... it was fully in escrow and I do not plan on using that address ever again.<br /><br />One of the first vendors I ever reviewed samples for was PaperChasing... and now he&#039;s one of the best vendors here.&nbsp; If he hadn&#039;t done that initial sampling, it would have taken him longer to set up shop, and he may never have had the rep he has today.

				there is a known answer for this, so stop saying there isnt...its not judgement, or&nbsp; personal opinion.. ITS FACT<br /><br />dont do it!<br /><br />&nbsp;fuck giving your address to new vendors AND being the forum guinea pig, your wrong for doing this and you need to go back to the basics of security and learning to be a long lasting customer of the Road.<br /><br />BUT I like you guinea pigs you tells us how the vendors shit is! SO keep telling yourselves it is ok and worth it and keep them reviews popping up...The community would not be the same without our forum jokers! The said part is you get send the good stuff and unknowingly vouch for a guy who wants us to finalize early so he can &quot;keep the product flowing&quot; haha <br /><br />To the donks in here saying do it with trusted vendors- well derrr im pretty sure the trusted vendors dont give out free samples(and when they do its sent to a mod to test and give a detailed and intelligent report on), its the new guys that give us the freebees (most of them repetitive scammers trying to build a bogus rep)<br /><br />But what do I know i bathe in endeavors, right?
