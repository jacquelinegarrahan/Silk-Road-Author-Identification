				To the max?&nbsp; That&#039;s easy.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />Snark aside... read through the old forum posts.&nbsp; There is a lot of good advice here.&nbsp; There is also a lot of shit advice.&nbsp; Sorting through it is going to depend upon whose opinion you trust, so when you hit those points of conflict, do your own research and make up your own mind.

				i would firstly recommend you not even think about vending until your security is truly 1000% up to par. so good thing you asked! however i feel you should really be more concerned about doing the extensive amount of research its gonna take, on the vast amount of information available to you here, via the search engine, and elsewhere. For your OWN protection first. before ever thinking about protecting the personal information and freedom of others. there are SOOOO many factors involved. it&#039;s really all uphill..<br /><br />there was a time when you&#039;d overwhelmingly get a &quot;UTFSE!!!&quot; as a standard response to such a question. but i really like our that our pretty awesome little community here on SR seems to, for the most part, prefer to actually offer a helpful response (what a concept!) compared to a gazillion others on various forums in the past...for that i thank you all. makes me wanna stick around. ;)<br /><br />you gotta make your average customer even trust you with their personal info, ect. ,and imo, it&#039;s kind of a &quot;if you have to ask&quot; kinda situation. there are so many varying factors to consider, to cover your own ass, and the ass of your customers. please do not attempt half-assed. cover all the bases. just seems there&#039;s alot of peepz that &quot;wanna get in on selling&quot;. without having the basic security knowledge you should at least have as a user/customer.<br /><br />there&#039;s are a bunch of basic guides to SR in general, GPG, TOR, MAC spoofing, bitcoins, physical security, encryption, how to safely ship, stay anonymous, ect, scattered all over SR. those are just some of many things i feel you should have an &#039;above average&#039; knowledge of, and experience using. before EVER considering vending. maybe search for Tails or Liberte? maybe UTFSE? ;)<br /><br />im just really surprised at the trust some customers place in some vendors here, some not even using GPG, using hotmail, ect??...justawow! :(
