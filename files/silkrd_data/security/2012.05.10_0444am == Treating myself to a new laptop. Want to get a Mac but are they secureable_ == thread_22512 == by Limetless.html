				Ok so I this is pretty self explanatory. Currently I have a Vaio but I fancy going balls in and treating myself to a Macbook Pro. Are they good security-wise? Are they more/less secure than Windows-based laptops? What do people recommend? <br /><br />Cheers GANGSTAS! <br /><br />Lim

				Yeah macs are harder for virus and malware creators, but there have been some recently that are still able to get on your Mac, I suspect that in the coming of years hackers well develop more for Macs.

				Hmm you see I&#039;m not tech savvy enough to learn Linux etc and I do love how Macs work so I think I&#039;m going to go for it and keep the Mac OS. Really I just want to know if the security can be beefed up to the same level as I have at the moment. Never tinkered with a Mac in that sense before.

Also is it true that Macs are harder to hack because most viruses/trojans/keyloggers etc are written for Windows OS?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ehh, the only reason thats true is because there are more window OS users than there are macs, there are still viruses for macs, and they arent much if at all harder to infect than windows machines are. But since macs can not run .exes (where a lot of viruses are) they do not have as much risk.<br /><br />Also, to the guy that said you cant find programs there are multiple ways around this. First off, most popular programs have mac versions available, if there are some programs that happen to be window only (Games as well) you have a couple options, you could dual boot windows on your mac, OR the easier way that I use, you can use a virtual machine program. You have a few choices,&nbsp; popular programs are parallels and virtualbox. I personally use and like virtualbox more, but they both work and you can pirate both of them on pirate bay, this lets you install an os and section off a small part of the hd for that, and run it in a window so you can open any games or programs on that and use them.

I need to wipe the old girl anyway because obviously...yeah...lol....so I can just get that done and have a play around and see how it goes. <br /><br />

It&#039;s certainly as easy to install as windows and now thanks to the software centre, any time you need a new program you can just add it from there 99% of the time.<br /><br />Even when you have to get down and dirty with the command line there is always a website which will tell you exactly what to type so you can just copy and paste.<br /><br />I would say Linux has a slight security advantage over a Mac in that a password is required each time you want to make a significant change but a Mac can be modified to have this feature too (apparently!) and I did initially use a Macbook to access SR back in the day. <br /><br />Ultimately when it comes to Security it&#039;s a question of adapting your own habits to make sure you&#039;re using your computer in a safe way. This involves using full disk encryption for instance, creating Bitcoin wallets using Live CD&#039;s (very easy if you haven&#039;t done this before - please ask) and making sure you keep your browser for SR and PGP/GPG software apart from the main Operating System.<br /><br />My advice to you for what it&#039;s worth is by all means get your Mac if you can afford it! But have a virtual machine installed on it running a Linux Operating System for all your more sordid activities. Once again this is very easy to set up, by all means ask if you need any help.<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Go with Mint it is like Ubuntu but even easier. If Ubuntu is almost ready for the masses, Mint is.

				I was pretty clueless when it came to my Mac, really, it&#039;s pretty simple. It&#039;s a few different keys and commands but all in all, Macs are great. Once you switch to the Mac OSX there&nbsp; is an adjustment period, just stick with it, it&#039;s worth it. I was skeptical, now....total fan.

				macs are just PC&#039;s with a different OS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Secure them the same way, download liberte or tails and write it to a flash drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bam, secure.<br /><br />If I had the money, I flash it to a self encrypting SSD (these are bad ass, no performance hit for encryption, but are there back doors?) and run a Tails install with an additional encrypted partition.&nbsp; Or, even if not running tails linux, I&#039;d install my OS there, keep all my games (which I don&#039;t play) and movies and music on a encrypted HDD.&nbsp; No need to access that shit fast, so no performance hit.&nbsp; Maybe keep my special filess, like passwords, etc in a tripple encrypted Micro SD card.<br /><br />but, Tails, linux, it&#039;s like ten minutes to install and boot.&nbsp; there is nothing to set up, no configuration to do, it just works.&nbsp; and it&#039;s fast.&nbsp; Tails running on a class, 2, I think, SD card is faster than windows running on a unencrypted HDD.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t even use my hard drive, which is now totally encrypted, btw, I should unplug it, maybe sell it, I don&#039;t need it, and it would save power/battery life. buy drugs instead.&nbsp; yeah, I should do that.&nbsp; <br /><br />My hidden Os can be popped out of my comuter and bitten and swallowed in like, 1 second?&nbsp; maybe less? it is in a micro sd -&gt; usb adapter.&nbsp; Micro SD cards, i&#039;m sure, taste like candy.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t matter anyways, it&#039;s tails, which means it saves no trace except in the encrypted file.<br /><br /><br />I imagine that the OS would run faster off of a class six card which has a higher read/write rate.&nbsp; Mine is 2gb and shitty.&nbsp; fast enough for me though, I just read about drugs, <br /><br />ugh.&nbsp; I&#039;m depressed.
