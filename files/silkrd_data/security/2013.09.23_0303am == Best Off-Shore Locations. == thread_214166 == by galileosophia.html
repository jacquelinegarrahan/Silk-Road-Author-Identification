				Relative to the US and Europe, what are the safest off-shore hosting locations?&nbsp; It&#039;s also worthwhile to include stability of the country in the ranking.<br /><br />Some places I&#039;d like to hear commentary about are:<br /><br />-- Argentina<br />-- Panama<br />-- Sweden<br />-- Romania<br />-- Singapore<br /><br />Lastly, is there a good resource out there showing which countries are allies/enemies and do not have a tradition of extradition and cooperation?

				Offshore hosting you would want Ukraine or Russia. Iceland depending on what you&#039;re doing/hosting as well.<br />All the fraud forums are hosted out of Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova, basically all CIS countries.<br /><br />Out of your list I would pick Panama as Singapore is a police state, Argentina too flaky and close to US (they just busted a hacking crew there), Sweden has data retention laws, Romania possibly if it&#039;s your only choice.<br /><br />Go on forums like Xakepy and antichat portal of russian hackers, translate the pages and look for bulletproof hosting <br />http://forum.antichat.ru/forum148.html

				Make architecture your friend.<br /><br />Assuming you are talking .onion then your front door doesn&#039;t need to be in the same country as your house. <br /><br />In fact multiple front doors are a good idea - point them as appropriate to your content. If you lose a front door, you haven&#039;t necessarily lost your content.<br /><br />

				Remember to look at all parts - if you use a .com or .net type name with this service, make sure you have registered it somewhere &#039;safe&#039; as well. But most would advise not using a .com or .net TLD.<br /><br />See where the DNS servers are, if they are in another jurisdiction, you&#039;re vulnerable there.&nbsp; Server location, TLD choice, and trust of staff of server location are key.&nbsp; I would recommend asking about your ability to visit your server with them.<br /><br />Singapore is a police state indeed.<br />Panama might have some kind of connection but it won&#039;t be cheap<br />Argentina is similar in many regards<br />Romania if you can figure out who to pay to get things done might work well. But you&#039;ll pay repeatedly.<br />Sweden would work with whatever agency might be interested in someone doing business in their country.<br /><br />I like Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Macau, Brunei, Hong Kong, and Philippines, as a starting group<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve used hosting providers in CR, Thailand, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.&nbsp; I have connections in a few of those countries who would happily act as &#039;remote hands&#039; as long as the space in the rack was paid for, and the server install instructions were not overly complex.<br /><br />I don&#039;t trust anyone selling &#039;bulletproof hosting&#039;, I do trust the people I know on the ground in these places.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked with some of them over 10 years, and know that if anyone was interested in the activity coming from the 1u or 2u server I rented space for, I would be notified well in advance of any third party being given access to my server... <br /><br />I also have a good relationship with a hosting provider operating out of the Bahamas if that&#039;s of interest.
