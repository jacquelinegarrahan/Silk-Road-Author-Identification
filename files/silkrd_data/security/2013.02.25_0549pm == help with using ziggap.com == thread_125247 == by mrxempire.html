				hey guys, its mrxempire here, everyone&#039;s favorite noob! I&#039;ve been trying to put some bitcoins on my account for the past week, but unfortunately bitinstant has been down for quite some time. Although bitinstant says that most of their services will be back up sometime today, I would like to be prepared in case bitinstant is unable to recover from this situation. The only way i know how to buy bitcoins is by going to bitinstant.com, and clicking the cash deposit from CVS to bitcoin address. After i fill out all the required fields, bitinstant gives me a zipzap payment slip, which i use to fill out a moneygram slip, which i then take to my local CVS or supermarket help desk. From what I gather from other people, ziggap.com will allow you to do the same thing. Unfortunately my tiny insignificant brain cannot comprehend how to work this site. I go to ziggap.com, click on &quot;get bitcoin&quot;, click moneygram, fill out all the information, giving my tormail as the email address, and putting my Silk road bitcoin address in the required field, and then...i&#039;m not sure. It simply says &quot;waiting for user to pay&quot;. When i click on the option to pay, it tells me that I can either pay online at moneygram.com using a credit card (fuck that), or i can find a moneygram agent near me and pay with cash. But I was never given the information needed to fill out the moneygram slip. The email that they sent me only lists the ziggap order number, and the bitcoin address that i wish to send the funds to. Theres no zipzap payment slip or anything similar to that, which has the moneygram info that i put on the slip. Can anyone help me out here? I know the answer to my problem is probably obvious, and staring me in the face, so please do&#039;t make fun of me too much when giving me the info. Thank you

				I&#039;ll take a seat right next to you on the N00b bus to ZigGap.<br /><br />But, I believe they are attempting to setup cash to BTC via moneygram same as bitInstant &quot;used to&quot;.&nbsp; Right now I think you (and I) are gonna pay a hefty service fee for standard (not BillPay) Moneygram to Ziggap.&nbsp; I have read that tomorrow ZigGap should have Bank-to-BTC going and are working on the same scheme as CVS Moneygram (Bill Pay)-toBTC in the same fashionthat you have probably habitually used with BitInstant.&nbsp; The upcoming options I mention won&#039;t incur the $20-$40 cost for a standard Moneygram wire.<br /><br />Try ZigGap live chat with your questions.&nbsp; They are up-and-coming so will put tons of effort into getting you answers via technology that BitInstant has grown tired with or can&#039;t figure out.&nbsp; Take advantage of them while they are trying to get their name out there, ja?

				when I did it, there was a name and city that appeared on the payment screen.&nbsp; presumably, you go to cvs and make a moneygram payment to that person.&nbsp; you need to save the receipt to enter the info required on that same page.<br /><br />i didnt follow through, was just kinda testing viable methods.&nbsp;

				I went pretty far in the process... It appears to me that ziggap.com don&#039;t have the same setting as bitinstant. What they do have is basically a website telling you where to send your money via money grams. What they give you is an individual called Stormy something...in Alabama. We are suppose to send our money to a person, not paying a bill like bitinstant did with zipzap. I received an email to call money grams. I called them and a guy told me this was a scam and warned me not to send my money to this person Stormy in Alabama. Since I have been scammed for large amount of money before trying to get BTC I wanted to double check. I have been trying to reach ziggap.com for many hours with no success. If they are a legitimate business why am I sending money to some person in Alabama where they claim they are located in Florida? Any help on how to get BTC at this point will be great. I can not use Bank of America since there are none around here...

				I can verify I&#039;ve had buyers use their service - you probably pay 7-10% when you add in the W/U fee but.. the shit went smoothly as advertised<br /><br />You can put fake info in the order area and proceed to buy<br /><br />Is that not worth being anonymous? Mt Gox and more and more services want your ID and other shit - fuck them<br /><br />I do not have any affiliation ziggap&nbsp; but a friend used them recently and vouched for their services<br /><br />C8<br />

I made a cash deposit to a Chase account. The account appeared to be a person, not a business, in Florida. I don&#039;t think I should say the name, but it wasn&#039;t &quot;Stormy something&quot;. <br /><br />It went very smoothly. The only difference is bitinstant was, well, instant, where with ziggap I had to go back to the website and manually tell them the deposit had been made. I did receive my coins within 5 minutes after doing that, though. <br /><br />Their Chase deposit option was removed within hours of that, or I would have used them again. The rate was great.<br /><br />My guess is they are a legitimate startup, but they are overwhelmed and underprepared for the demand they will receive, particularly in the wake of bitinstant&#039;s crumbling. <br /><br />Anyway with that method of deposit the fees were super competitive. No forms or anything. Just depositing cash at a bank. I have not done it myself, but from what I understand, their MoneyGram fees are a lot higher than bitinstant because it&#039;s going to an individual, not a business. I just hope they bring Chase deposits back as there are no BoAs in my area either.

				I must say, A+ for ziggap.com<br />Everything negative I said about them, I take it all back! Everyone has to start somewhere. If bitinstant refuses to communicate and update their regular customers then fuck them. Give any new company a try. Ziggap&#039;s page is working fine and contact was made easily. Very helpful staff/owner. You do pay a person so the fee at Money Grams is higher than with bitinstant. Its also funny that on the other forums Charlie from Bitinstant told people not to use ziggap. Why? What has bitinstant done for us lately? Other than delay people&#039;s payments and drop services without any warning... I think more companies like ziggap should pop up. Its a good time to invest in bitcoins. Nothing illegal here, move on.
