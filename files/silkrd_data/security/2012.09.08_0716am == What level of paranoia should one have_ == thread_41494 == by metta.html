				I used quite a bit of coke 20 years ago, but I stopped for various reasons. In the last few years, I felt a rekindled interest in using again, but I didn&#039;t have a supplier, so no go. Finding SR has been a fantastic boon, but in reading about how others here protect their anonymity, I wonder if I&#039;m being too lax.<br /><br />I get my btc through bitinstant. I use CVS or some other similar store to make a cash deposit, and then have bitinstant send the coin to my SR address. There&#039;s a red phone at CVS where you pick up and talk to a service person who takes your information, including your name, address, and phone number. The first time I did this, I was so surprised by the personal info request (I had read beforehand that this was an anonymous way to get btc) I gave my correct info. I later thought there is nothing illegal in transferring money, so I didn&#039;t worry about it much. The second time I used this service, my deposit was much larger and after the phone exercise, I went to the cashier to hand over the money although this time I was asked for an ID. Since I had used my correct info, this was not a problem, but it certainly defeated the idea of remaining anonymous.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read that it is a good idea to have your coin go to a primary wallet and then be transferred to SR. Some even advocate a tumbling service beforehand when depositing to your SR account. My logic questions these extra steps since as I understand it, your SR address isn&#039;t traceable and is an anonymous address. Of course, after I get my btc, I use pgp for my communications so there isn&#039;t a connection between my SR alias and my real name.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a very paranoid person, but I&#039;ve never had a run in with LE. My feeling is coming after me for such small purchases for personal use isn&#039;t really worth the time, money, and effort. Perhaps I&#039;m delusional about this. I have a perfectly clean record as a stand up, law abiding citizen, so if I ever were caught, my feeling is I wouldn&#039;t get jail time. Again, I&#039;m naive about the criminal justice system, so my logic may be all wrong.<br /><br />I thought I would post this to see how crazy I&#039;m being for taking such minimal precautions. By the way, I&#039;m in CA.<br /><br />Any insight from those with greater experience would be greatly appreciated ...<br /><br />

				I have no insight but do have a question..<br />I am contemplating purchasing bitcoins soon pretty much exactly as you have done it.<br />Bitinstant&gt;Walmart moneygram&gt;bitcoin address<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know when you use this type of method they ask you for your personal information...Do you give them your real information and have you done this and purchased off SR with no problems?

				I&#039;ve done 4 transfers this way with no problems. I would suggest you use a false address and phone number, but not your name since you may be asked for your ID like I was. They don&#039;t check your info, it&#039;s just used in their database so when you deposit cash again, they just ask for a phone number to quicken the process. Keep in mind, though, Walmart may do things differently than CVS.
