				Okay guys, I am a much older (non-technical) man who has been doing hours of research on here so I can get my product out on silk road.&nbsp; THere are lots of people waiting on me to get my listings up and running..but I am starting to feel helpless.<br /><br />Can someone please help me out, and walk me through what I need to turn the green cash sitting in my hand right now into bitcoins that I can send to SR to upgrade my account to sellers account?<br /><br />I understand that since I am registering as a seller (and not just a small time buyer)&nbsp; I need to take some serious anonymous precautions to safely deposit the 29.41 in bitcoins to SR for the supplier account.&nbsp; <br /><br />My understanding is that the cost would be roughly $150 usd to start a supplier account.&nbsp; First thing I did was start an order with btcKING.&nbsp; I requested 30 bitcoins and he sent me something back saying I need to make a dep[osit for $190 and change at a chase bank to receive my 30 bitcoins.&nbsp; That seemed high, but I am still willing to do it..but I am confused at what I have to do after that.&nbsp; If I send btcKing the $190,l how does he send me bitcoins? do I not have to provide him with some bitcoin address, or name or email or something like that? It also says on the &#039;become a seller&#039; page that I cannot have ever made a purchase using the proposed seller account (which I havent) but if I make a purchase through btcKing..isn&#039;t that making a purchase meaning I can no longer use that account to become a seller?<br /><br />I have also considered trying to go through mt gox! BUT I have no idea if I am buying enough bitcoins or not sincei t only asks for USD.&nbsp; Since I read that it costs $150 to start a supplier account I typed in $160 at mt gox, and it came back saying I would get $151 usd back after they get their commission.&nbsp; But what about the bitcoin conversion? is $151 going to be worth enough bitcoins to buy a supplier account?<br /><br />UGH. this is killing me, giving me the biggest headache..but many many ppl in the SR community are counting on me to come through and become a vendor because there are virtually no domestic venders in what I am selling. I do not want to let down the SR community..but I have to somehow figure out a way to SAFELY get SR their 29.41 in bitcoins.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind doing btcKing even if its an extra $40..but even after I send him the funds via cash deposit through a chase bank...I still dont understand how I will receive the bitcoins from btcKing..and if and when I do receive the bitcoins..do I not have to do a bunch of stuff to keep anonymous, like &#039;tumbling&#039; etc..?<br /><br />I&#039;m so sorry guys and I apologize to the rumor mill ppl who are waiting for me to open up shop..but I just can&#039;t exactly figure out how to do it, and to do it safely/anonymously as a seller should.&nbsp; If someone could please hold my hand, and take me through the process in the most layman of terms..it would be MUCH appreciated! Again, I am an old man trying to bring superior product to this market..but I can&#039;t just figured it out.&nbsp; All you techie kids, pretend this is your grandpa trying to learn how to use bitcoin (I have grand kids) and that you are showing him the best, most affordable and quickest way to buy bitcoins and put them into SR for a supplier account.&nbsp; Do I need some kind of bitcoin address? etc?&nbsp; much help would be GREATLY appreciated..whoever is willing to help will make a certain SR market VERY happy :)<br /><br />THanks, and looking forward to supplying a new level of quality product to SR<br /><br />

				If you use BTCking or whomever ... he&#039;s supposed to send bitcoins to the account you used to contact and &quot;buy&quot; them from him. <br /><br />You wouldn&#039;t be using any ID to deposit the money since it&#039;s not your personal bank account. If anyone asks for ID, tell them that it&#039;s a corporate account and you just need to make a deposit. <br /><br />P.S. You can find your bitcoin address if you click the Account link on the top of your SR page.

				Ok, google either &quot;bitinstant&quot; or &quot;get-bitcoin&quot;<br /><br />They&#039;re very similar, so I&#039;ll walk you through the get-bitcoin process<br /><br />1. Go to instawallet.org, you&#039;ll be generated a BTC wallet. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE URL, that&#039;s the password to your BTC. If you lose it, you lose your bitcoin. You will also get a Bitcoin address, that&#039;s where BTC can be sent to. Record that as well in a notepad file or physically write it.<br />2. Go to get-bitcoin.com, place an order for a certain amount of BTC, and choose Chase Bank Deposit cash option. For the bitcoin address, use your instawallet one.<br />3. Go to the bank with the account number/name, deposit your cash.<br />4. Wait a little, and in 3-24 hours you should have bitcoin in your instawallet<br />5. Then from instawallet, send your bitcoin to your SR account. You can find that bitcoin address by clicking on account.<br />6. It takes a few hours to get to SR, and boom you&#039;re done
