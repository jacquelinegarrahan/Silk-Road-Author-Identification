				It currently takes me almost a week to acquire btc which is a problem for grabbing last minute deals or the last minute stock. So my question is, What is the quickest way with the smallest amount of fees to acquire BTC.

				I&#039;ve tried a couple different places and found get-bitcoin to be one of the quickest, if you have a Chase bank nearby.

				I have tried every way out there I think to deal with bitcoin, and, by far, the fastest,easiest and best is https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/&nbsp; see my post I put up earlier about BEST PLACE I FOUND TO GET BTC`` for more info but I guarantee if you use them, you will not be disappointed, tell them `wung`sent ya and they will def hook you up with goo service cuz i send them a lot of referrals and wouldnt want to lose that so they treat the people i send there very good. if you have any problem with them, you can msg me but you wont! and I have no affiliation with them and get no money or anything for sending them referrals, I am just so happy with the great job they do that I want to send them more biz!!

				They charge he same for everyone so I think you might have been looking at a different site. As far as I know, its the same price all around, the only thing people for i.s. have to keep in mind is prices are posted in cad $ so you gotta keep that exchange rate in mind (which is not that bad right now) but thats it!
