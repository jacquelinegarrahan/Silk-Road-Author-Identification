				The directory is located in Windows 7 here:&nbsp; C:\Users\(removed)\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache<br /><br />It will not allow itself to be deleted and it has two directories in it labeled:&nbsp; Metadata and Content.&nbsp; All of the files in those two directories have file names like this: ACF244F1A10D4DBED0D88EBA0C43A9B5_A9C858C1E3D297A71D80B8E1560DA3B5<br />After doing a little research online it seems to be a record of all browsing and possibly a record of your computer usage.<br />I have already added that directory to my Ccleaner that runs every time my computer boots, although I not sure Windows will allow them be deleted that way or not.<br /><br />Can anyone knowledgeable chime in here?&nbsp;

				Cryptneturlcache is an encrypted copy of data pertaining to your browsing and download history. I don&#039;t know exactly what info it holds. Microsoft encryption has been voluntarily compromised, with the US national security apparatus able to decrypt at will :0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Best to use Tails or liberte linux for SR and other risky online behaviour, if not doing so already. Also, discarding Windows entirely, wiping your drive, and installing Ubuntu or something similar wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea. Windows XP works pretty well within Virtual Box in Ubuntu for when you want to use Windows for something. However, if you don&#039;t want to do that there are command lines that, supposedly, clear the cache. If you want them I should probably be able to find them :) AB.

				So Windows does keep an encrypted copy of everything I have browsed and downloaded?&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp; What if I am using a third-party browser?&nbsp; Will it still be able to save my browsing history?&nbsp;

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I can&#039;t give a more technical answer, but from what I understand it doesn&#039;t matter what browser you use if it is not encrypting all connections. Even then, I believe, private browsing on Chrome or Firefox etc, visiting only https sites, still leaks data that is stored in a number of locations in Windows.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what, if any, data can be unintentionally leaked to Windows when using Tor browser safely (sticking to hidden sites, not downloading any files) but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s a bit...

				Sorry, I don&#039;t know anything about that specifically, but it&#039;s safe to say that there are traces of your activities (browsing as well as non-browsing) all over your computer in various caches and files. Take a look at what the browser bundle leaves behind on Windows, and it&#039;s designed to leave as little evidence as possible:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148291.msg1152452#msg1152452<br /><br />Most other apps will leave behind a lot more. The best way to avoid leaving evidence is to use a bootable OS like Tails, or you can hide the evidence by fully encrypting your hard drive, but you never know what Windows might transmit back to Microsoft.<br /><br />

				What about running your clearnet and Tor browser in a sandbox like Sandboxie?&nbsp; Would that prevent anything from being written to this cache?

				I don&#039;t know that particular program, but if you try to run tails in a virtual environment on your OS, even a linux one, it warns you that your activity is no longer amnesiac, your activity is recorded on the hard drive and within the logs of the virtualiser. I&#039;d assume that your activity is probably even more comprehensively recorded if using something less secure than tails.

				This is the problem with running any proprietary software, especially from a company that actively works with LE to backdoor its programs (Skype) and provides forensics tools like this:<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFEE<br />

				okay, admittedly i&#039;m the fred flintstone of this stuff, but i may have&nbsp; been doing something that was right for reasons i wasn&#039;t aware of. For the past 3 years, i&#039;ve been cloning my harddrive, cloned it when i first started using a windows 7 desktop, and then as data changed in particlular programs (ie email, or quickbooks, document files, i&#039;d do a backup on those files into the appropriate directory on the cloned hard drive. Then once a year, around christmas, i clone the backup hard drive to my desktop (someone that sounded like he knew what he was talking about had told me to once a year to do a complete reformat of my computer and re-install every program - this way seemed easier.<br /><br />one downfall, is when i do that, windows has a ton of updates to download but i&#039;m thinking now to maybe do that more often. wouldn&#039;t that erase that cache file with a virgin file?

I can&#039;t give you specifics, but I think it&#039;s wise to assume Windows takes and stores, permanently, some trace of everything you ever do with it. It is crazy how much info you can retrieve using freeware data recovery tools. As Astor said, leo have at their disposal great technical prowess and a significant technological advantage. Windows is a threat, AB.
