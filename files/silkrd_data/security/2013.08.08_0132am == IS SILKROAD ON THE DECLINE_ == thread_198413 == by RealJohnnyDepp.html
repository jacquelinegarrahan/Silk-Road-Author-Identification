Calm down, if shit hit the fan you should be prepared long before it does. Otherwise using this site is a huge risk. If you don&#039;t know what you are doing, don&#039;t do it.

				I bet 80% of the buyers not only never look at this forum, but they probably have no idea about freedom hosting or that it was shut down. The vast majority see this site in a news article, load up TBB, and then use this place like Amazon to buy a bunch of drugs all at once to their home address and only use internal messaging not even knowing Tormail ever existed.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sure one day it might.<br /><br />My guess is they will leave it running as long as the statutes of limitations allow, then go after anyone they can readily identify and slap everyone they get with RICO + Conspiracy RICO.<br /><br />Just communicate safely and don&#039;t be a dumbass.
