				I have been looking for days, but all i can find is that you have to make an account on that, one on this, and so on. And all so all the different steps + some dare to ask for your ID&nbsp; ::) ::).<br />So if anyone from the EU OR Belgium like me can say a quick easy way then thank you. In the Usa we could have Money Packs and go to Sugar Momma :D. But if something exist like that here to let me know, but not Ukash (or is there a way to also cash it out?).<br />Thanks in advance people ;)<br />Greetttzz :)

				I have no experience with this, but here&#039;s a method I figured should work:<br /><br />- Get one of those anonymous Polish IBAN cards (or a couple, depending on how much BTC you must cash out - there&#039;s a limit on those cards). Check out SR and other hacker forums in onion land (the ones I saw on SR were overpriced).<br />- Sell your BTC for euro&#039;s on an exchange like Intersango (do not use the site through Tor, instead get a proxy in your country/someones wifi/prepaid 3G card/public internet). You can even automate this with the API&#039;s.<br />- Withdraw your euro&#039;s to your IBAN card and cash out at an ATM (use multiple, just to be safe). Because of the limit, go around 23:45 and use the ATM again after 0:00.<br /><br />Although this probably won&#039;t attract much (if any) attention, I&#039;d try to keep as anonymous as possible (wear a motor helmet at the ATM, for example).<br /><br />The coupons (like money packs and Ukash) rely afaik on the fact that you&#039;re a &#039;store&#039; and cash those coupons out. I dunno if European online stores can cash out money packs. I believe that Ukash got a lot stricter, which is why not many people offer BTC for Ukash anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck :).
