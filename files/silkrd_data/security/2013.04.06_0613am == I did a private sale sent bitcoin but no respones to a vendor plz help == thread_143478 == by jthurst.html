				Well no one can really do anything for you, sorry to say. You went out of escrow and even though you&#039;ve dealt with this vendor before, you can&#039;t trust anyone. You don&#039;t know this vendor personally. I really hope they haven&#039;t taken your money and run away...

				Sorry to hear about that. Once the guy has your coins there really is nothing Sr can do. The escrow system is there for your protection. <br /><br />By private sale do you mean completely outside of the Sr system? <br /><br />You got to watch out for scams. One of the biggest ways they pay off big is too earn your trust so you do something like this and they take you for as much as they can.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t mean everyone is a scammer ( more good people here than bad)&nbsp; but you always have to keep your guard up against the few bad ones. <br /><br />I hope your travels get better. <br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t mean to sound abrupt, but.. why would you send him money directly and bypass the SR escrow system? You&#039;re aware that escrow is there for YOUR protection, yes?<br />Boggles my mind why any buyer would choose to bypass that..

				Not trying to be a dick but why is it so hard for people to understand if you don&#039;t follow the rules set in place YOU are taking a major risk and YOU have to eat whatever loss comes with risking to buy/sell outside of the sr rules. They are their for a reason i&#039;ve been here a few weeks and seem to understand that better then people who have been here waaaaaaaaaaay before me..

				We should have a stickie on the forums... Call it &quot;The Wall of Rememberance&quot; or something.<br /><br />It should contain the name of the user who lost coin, how much they lost and what action they took to lose it.<br /><br />FACT FOR TODAY:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve done loads of deals with him before and there was never ever a problem.&quot; - Every scammer is waiting to hear these or similar words come from your lips.
