				I just did business with them, they were very good.&nbsp; 0 percent commission on western union or moneygram to btc, and they sold me my coins at below the going rate.&nbsp; It was like, $4.67 per coin.&nbsp; Good communication, grasp of English is not 100% but it&#039;s certainly good enough.&nbsp; I recommend moneygram over western union - moneygram&#039;s fees for international transfers are lower, like $10 vs. $30 for Western Union.&nbsp; Make sure if you plan to use a fake name that you&#039;ve got a phone number to go with it that is neither tied to you or tied to someone who has used moneygram or western union in the past, otherwise you might have some splaining to do when they pull up the number in the system.&nbsp; but no big deal if it happens you can just tell them that such and such is your roommate or whatever, but easier if you just have a tracfone or something.&nbsp; Also make sure the agent types in the receiver name exactly right.&nbsp; Even a small spelling error can screw up their ability to pick up the funds.&nbsp; If sending large amounts of money, they will want ID.
