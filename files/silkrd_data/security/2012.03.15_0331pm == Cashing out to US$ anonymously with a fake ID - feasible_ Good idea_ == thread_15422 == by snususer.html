				I&#039;m a newb here.&nbsp; I just made my first purchase recently and am now considering going into business.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t seen any discussion on these pages about this method, but why not use a fake ID to get a bank account with which to cash out?&nbsp; &nbsp;Driver&#039;s licenses are sold on SR for like BTC20.&nbsp; It&#039;s been awhile since I opened my legit bank account, but I don&#039;t remember the process being very lengthy or intrusive.&nbsp; I know they run a ChexSystems check on you, which wouldn&#039;t return any results, but would that flag your ID as fake?&nbsp; I cant remember if they needed a #SSN - probably.&nbsp; Would a bank know if a (slightly less than) random SSN was phony?&nbsp; I know there is a geography/date numbering system for SSNs.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thoughts? Or is everyone loathe to give away trade secrets?&nbsp; One guy on here was asking about how to cash out securely and the response was just &quot;it would be stupid to give away our methods in public&quot;.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s true to an extent, but there seems to be plenty of guidance about all other aspects of security available in this forum.&nbsp; I just feel like I haven&#039;t seen a &#039;standard operating procedure&#039; for US$ withdrawal anywhere, and that&#039;s frustrating. Please help? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks.
