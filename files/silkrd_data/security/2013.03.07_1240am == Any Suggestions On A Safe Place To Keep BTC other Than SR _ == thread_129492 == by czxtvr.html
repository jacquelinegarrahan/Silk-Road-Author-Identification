				Here,you can store them in this wallet:<br />15aU3mWBdm5MNPHa5nsz4huPPCNcHwCLnE<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep them safe for you. . .<br /><br />Seriously though,&nbsp; get a desktop client wallet so you can store them on your computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other ones are all online , but that&#039;s not as secure.&nbsp; Another option is an account with a bit coin exchange.&nbsp; You can store them there too.grt the wallet .&nbsp; It&#039;s free software .

				&nbsp;use bitcoin desktop wallet, use the encrypt wallet option, encrypt with passwd, and copy wallet.dat to an encrypted usb drive.&nbsp; just dont forget your passwords.&nbsp; and you can make multiple copies, in case you lose one.&nbsp; you can also print them out on paper some how i was reading...&nbsp; with a qrf code and everything :D

				Offline wallet for sure, just make sure you create a wallet on a clean, virus/ malware free O/S(or a LiveUsb would be my recommendation to create one on), then make sure to make copies of your wallet.dat file as others have said

You create a LiveUSB running Linux that has 0 networking and store the private keys for your wallet. This way you do whats called an offline transaction where you sign the transaction from the LiveUSB then using the Armory desktop client you send the coins. This way your private keys are never exposed to the network, and your coins are safe on a USB in a safety deposit box, safe, etc.

				I don&#039;t see SR as a safe wallet. There have been week long site outages and realistically this site could disappear completely at any time with no notice. For large amounts definitely store in offline computer or paper wallet. For smaller amounts I prefer one of the many online wallets with 2 factor identification (I use blockchain.info)

				You could store your coins in MY wallet... Though, some may become spent, and I may become high.

				Store them in your butt. No really, put your wallet on a usb and just jam em right up there. Give it a week or two and you&#039;ll be shitting gold.

				People always advise to use offline wallets.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know how to keep your operating system clean from virus then an ONLINE wallet will be most of the time more secured. Big BTC market places sometimes offer double auth (OTP and such) which makes it really hard to actually steal your password. The only way to steal you would be an intrusion on the market place server itself. And most of the time many things are encrypted and protected by multiple FW and other security procedures.<br /><br />Do you think you can achieve the same level security on your crappy windows system ? Do you make regular backups ? What if your wallet.dat file gets corrupted ? What if your computer is physically stolen ?<br /><br />It&#039;s not that easy to tell people to always prefer offline wallet since you have this betraying feeling of control over your money. Most of the time, if you are not an IT professionnal, that encrypted .dat file will not be that much hard to steal and decode. Get a list of serious online wallets, and then ask yourself if your IT proficiency is really better than what your online wallet service can offer.<br /><br />I personnally trust my market place wallet for being highly secured at no cost or specific efforts. The simple fact that they offer double auth is very reassuring and displays a real concern to security for their customers.

This wallet will NEVER be online EVER! The only way someone can steal your private key is to physically steal the USB drive or paper wallet you printed out. It is impossible for someone to steal your coins remotely.
