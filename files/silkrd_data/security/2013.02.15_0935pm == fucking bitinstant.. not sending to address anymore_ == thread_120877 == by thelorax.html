				I am trying to find out whether that&#039;s a permanent change.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s not.&nbsp; As you probably know, bitinstant was a victim of a DOS attack, which was a major factor in the service outages in the last couple of days.

				A number of BTC exchanges were attcked, including BitInstant.&nbsp; I know I keep sounding like an apologist for them.&nbsp; I&#039;m not, really, it&#039;s just that if you pay attention to the forums, they are doing their best to communicate issues and pay out refunds.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what else people expect from them.<br /><br />The cash -&gt; BTC address service is expected to be back up soon.&nbsp; Hope for both our sake&#039;s that&#039;s true.&nbsp; I usually use bitfloor as a backup, but with the bank holiday on Monday, that won&#039;t be an option until Tuesday.

				I haven&#039;t received my bitcoins from bitinstant since I sent them Wednesday. I was going to do 4 or 5 transactions through Bitinstant for over 2k but after researching these past couple of days I gave BlueSky traders a try. The service was very fast and professional. I got Bitcoins with-in a few minutes of making deposit. The exact fee I was charged was % 4.2 .&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend BlueSky for anyone needing a large amount of bitcoins. It saves a ton of time and stress. I hope I could be some help.

				To each his own.&nbsp; I appreciate the fact that bitinstant has a forum dedicated to communicating with its customers, and a CEO who personally communicates with angry (and often verbally abusive) customers.&nbsp; My funds were held up for two days, and when the funds were finally credited they were credited at the current exchange rate, because it was higher, and the 3.99% fee was refunded entirely.&nbsp; Bitinstant isn&#039;t perfect, but they get an A for customer service in my book.<br />

They have not slept all weekend, making sure everyone&#039;s emails, chats, and calls have been answered within minutes.<br />Thanks for your continuing business and support<br />Charlie<br /><br />End Quote:/<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />8)

				I&#039;ve been using BitInstant for a couple months. I used to use bitfloor cash deposits &#039;til they stopped. It was so fast and easy. It turns out bitfloor&#039;s back! Which was really exciting for me at first. One thing I didn&#039;t care for was their customer service though. Roman was always rude. Don&#039;t know if anyone else here has dealt with that. CryptoCurrent too I was excited about for anonymous cash deposits like the good&#039;ol days. <br />It turns out they don&#039;t apply to me though. Bank of America seems to be the only bank left that&#039;s willing to fuck with BTC traders. I live in a small town and we had a couple BOA&#039;s for as long as I can recall, but just my luck they all closed last year and the nearest one is like 250 miles away. This probably isn&#039;t an issue for most of you. I checked into Blue Sky Traders like y&#039;all suggested and same dilemma, but I started to chat with the guys at CryptoCurrent and they provide free next day air mail through UPS or FedEx. UPS is cheaper for them and I prefer them to FedEx personally. FedEx is slowest in the biz in my opinion. <br />Since after Sunday BitInstant hadn&#039;t got their shit together I wasn&#039;t banking on them being ready today. CryptoCurrent e-mailed me a prepaid label on a PDF and this morning I printed it off, bought a congratulations card and mailed them cash. It sounded like a hassle and it kinda is. Con - it takes an extra day. Con - I had to buy a card, but I guess I didn&#039;t have to. They said one could use an old magazine, or wrap it in junk paper, but to conceal it in something semi neat before sticking it in the carrier&#039;s envelope. Pro - I didn&#039;t have to use my identity. I didn&#039;t have to go through the trouble of using a fake identity. I didn&#039;t have to worry about which location to go to at what times so not arouse suspicion for using these different pseudo identities or have an awkward transaction. Pro - Even if BitInstant is running tomorrow I&#039;ll have my BTC&#039;s tomorrow and probably sooner at this point. Con - I haven&#039;t used CryptoCurrent before, nor have I sent cash in the mail to buy BTC&#039;s before, but based on all their good reviews and my very friendly and pleasant interaction with them so far I&#039;m not worried at all. (Fuck &quot;Roman&quot;) <br />Also, I have to say aside from buying the card on the way the whole FedEx thing was super fast! I walked in.. waited in line for 20 seconds, told the teller that I needed &quot;this&quot; air mailed and handed him the card and the page I printed. He said &quot;Okay&quot; fixed the package up in no time and asked if I needed a receipt for tracking. I walked in and out within like three minutes total. No painful parking either. WalMart&#039;s always a hassle. The fee is 5%. Not so bad. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll even go back to BitInstant. It&#039;s only one day difference and it&#039;s stress free and I like being anonymous AND I can deposit directly into my SR account (the next day- lol.) I&#039;ll update after everything goes smoothly tomorrow. Peace
