				First and last time I use these.. They did say they would be down for a FEW hours early hours on the 16th but no warning of this prior my purchase. Pretty bad way to do business if you ask me.

Ironically the more people that lose faith in their service and stop using it, the more reliable it will be on that basis.<br /><br />I work in a bank and I see brokers make thousands of minute transactions every day so I really don&#039;t understand where they&#039;re coming from on this. I have messaged all my customers to inform them of the slight delay - if problems continue by Monday I will process all orders from my personal store of BTC, normal service will resume! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The issue with Intersango is the type of Metro account they have, I personally use Metro bank for various reasons and never have issues when Intersango are claiming they are. <br /><br />They should stop using a personal account and get a business account. <br /><br />The two run on different systems which I&#039;m sure Vlad1m1r could explain better, and when the personal system is constantly down for &#039;upgrades&#039; nothing on Intersango runs, yet I can still log into my business banking just fine. It&#039;s well known that Metro take their personal accounts offline nearly every weekend, I&#039;m not sure what they&#039;re up to but hey ho.

This is disappointing as it&#039;s actually much easier to open a business account than a personal one!<br /><br />What I find faintly implausible as I said is this explanation that Intersango&#039;s servers couldn&#039;t deal with all the transactions to the account during the day - for starters these are batch processed and also the server doesn&#039;t distinguish between different accounts. As I understand it, it handles millions of transactions every second!<br /><br />Still nil desperandum, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just a temporary glitch and normal activity will resume soon.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
