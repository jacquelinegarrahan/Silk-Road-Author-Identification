				So I am checking out localbitcoins.com and the site seems great for someone who can get coins through a cash deposit... But I need $4200 in coins and the only way I can get that is if I meet up with this guy near my location and on his profile he requires SMS (a phone number) verification.. I mean I guess I can give this guy my # since I am only buying coins and it is 100% legal. But what should I say when he asks me why I need that much? That I&#039;m investing because I want to? <br /><br />Regards,<br />i push the kush

				Simply dont tell him anything, chances are he will not ask. I just used LBTC for 1400USD yesterday and we did not even talk. Money changed hands, phone beeped and BTC was im my E-wallet associated with LBTC site.<br />You have no need to converse about anything if you dont want to.<br /><br />And if you dont want to give up your phone number then go to your local gas station and buy a cheap burner phones just for those transactions. Love burner phones, dealer best friend.

				That&#039;s weird.&nbsp; Why would he demand that?&nbsp; As long as he has a phone, it shouldn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />Are you sure he&#039;s demanding your account to be phone verified?&nbsp; I mean, he&#039;s the one that&#039;s got to release the coins.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re meeting where he wants, probably some place close to his place... if you blew him off, not like he&#039;s lost anything.&nbsp; What, 15 minutes of his life?<br /><br />Ask him about this... I would.&nbsp; Tell him you&#039;d prefer to remain discreet and don&#039;t want to be hassled with buying a burner... well unless he wants to pay for it and toss extra coin in.&nbsp; You&#039;re doing him a favor!... 4K?... shit, he should bend over backwards to meet you.<br /><br />This sounds &quot;off&quot; imho.<br /><br />

				Burner phone (throw away) is the way to go. I&#039;ve already used my regular cell for BitInstant and others, and it only serves to get the text message that the coins are in there. <br /><br />Since all the shakeups with ฿TC exchanges, I figure a cheap disposable phone is worth the piece of mind. Even though I&#039;ve never made a purchase over $500, myself. <br /><br />It&#039;s kind of like a &quot;I&#039;ll show you mine if you show me yours&quot; thing, for some minimal amount of trust. All the ฿TC sellers I&#039;ve encountered on LocalBitcoins.com have their cell phone already in the body of the ad. <br /><br />You&#039;re buying bitcoins. Nothing else, right? - He&#039;s not going to ask you what you need them for. If that (God forbid) happens? I would be already with &quot;I&#039;m a degenerate gambler&quot; - followed by a &quot;though it IS none of your business&quot;. <br /><br />He won&#039;t ask. You&#039;re both doing each other a favor. He want&#039;s to sell them, you want to buy them. Neither party &quot;owes it to&quot; the other party to pay for a phone. - Any peculiar details like that, if they were to happen, would happen during the initial contact. <br /><br />14k? - You can afford a burner phone, and there shouldn&#039;t even be a question, &quot;Should I&quot; - Just do it! ;)<br /><br />I sure wouldn&#039;t mind having that kind of dough to go &#039;shopping&#039; with tonight! ;D<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />jagfug 8)

				If he has to ask why someone would want to buy btc he&#039;s sketch as it is. The value keeps going up and down so while it&#039;s easy to lose out it&#039;s also easy to make a nice profit, my guess is the only reason we don&#039;t see more people with disposable cash making investments is because of the scare that&#039;s been passed around by media hype.

				Guys, clearly EVERYONE buys bitcoins for investment purposes right? It&#039;s not like there&#039;s any other use for them. Especially as far as a BTC seller is concerned.&nbsp; ::) ;)

				Why do people keep on bringing up tit4tat&#039;s story when talking about LBC? He was almost certainly ratted out by his bank for having a large bitcoin mining operation. It had nothing to do with the LBC site. As for the other guy on bitcointalk, he was tracked in Ireland by LE. He won the lottery, since there isn&#039;t any other story out there which matches his. Still, this is why you should only do business with trusted BTC sellers. TRUSTED. That means the seller should have perfect feedback. You&#039;ll have to find a few people to trade with and stick with them. If you need to exchange $4000 then finding a few people to break up that amount would be much better than just rolling the dice with one guy. At least until you have a few successful trades under your belt. Then you&#039;ll be trusted as a BTC buyer to exchange much larger amounts of money. Just like on SR, you have to build relationships with trusted people in order to keep doing business with greatly minimized risk.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181588.msg1320039#msg1320039">Quote from: NickNack on July 09, 2013, 04:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I hear ya.&nbsp; But I remember reading a few stories of people getting raided at home after exchanges... somehow LE justifies it by saying only drug dealers use btc or something.<br /><br />Not that these are your exact situation, it&#039;s something to think about:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162443.0<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=174918.0&nbsp; (even though the guy deleted the OP, you can figure it out from the following posts)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Well I ended up using my own real phone number and verified it... then I ended up not getting coins from there because the guy too forever to respond and I ended up getting coins off the SR. Then I deleted my LBC account, so hopefully the feds don&#039;t kick in my door!

				Deleting your LBC account won&#039;t make any difference to the chances of police attention. All the info you put in there - and anywhere else on the internet - is all kept and available to be accessed by anyone with the appropriate warrants.<br /><br />Don&#039;t make the mistake of thinking if you delete something on-line its gone. It isn&#039;t.
