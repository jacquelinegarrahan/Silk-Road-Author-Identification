				I know that empty capsules can be bought in health or grocery stores in some places (like California) over the counter with no problem, as they&#039;re used for vitamins, herbal supplements, etc.<br /><br />California is a little different from other places in the US, though. Does anyone know if capsules are/have been/could be interpreted as drug parephernalia in other states? I&#039;m asking because I haven&#039;t been able to find any in any stores around my current location and I was wondering why that might be.

				Thank you, guys. If I had any idea how karma worked I would give you some. (I&#039;m guessing I have to be a higher rank to do that, so I guess I still probably wouldn&#039;t give you any.)
