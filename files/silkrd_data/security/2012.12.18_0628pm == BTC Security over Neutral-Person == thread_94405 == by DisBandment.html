				Hey,<br /><br />am new to the forums, i have read and learned allot already, so thank you for all those posting beginner threads and explaining how to improve ones own security and anonymity. <br />The part of the whole ordeal i have the most trouble understanding is how one could get Bitcoins anonymously without having to pay huge fees or incredibly complex transactions. <br /><br />Could someone explain to me why its not possible to do it like this:<br /><br />A friend who has nothing to do with any illegal sales or entities buys bitcoins legally and not anonymously. This friend then logs onto SR and transfers the money to me. I will give him cash in exchange for the bitcoins (maybe a bonus for his troubles) and be able to trade. <br />This obviously only works if the Bitcoins are properly untracable in the SR wallet which i am not sure is the case.<br />This is of interest to me due to the fact that i live in Germany and believe its quite difficult to get anonymous access to BTC here.<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated, please bear with me and keep in mind this is all new terrain.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance, :-*<br /><br />DisBandment

				Hi<br />The whole purpose of what you call incredibly complex transactions , is to break the connection between your SR btc address and the origin of the coins that probably has your name on it. If you transfer your coins directly in SR then in the hypothetical scenario that one day LE will find out that this address belongs to SR, they will be able to prove it was you (or your friend it doesn&#039;t matter). It&#039;s very easy to mix the coins, you can do it with bitfog, or even easier in blockchain.info, it has a mixer that works fine. Nothing complex about this.<br />It&#039;s all about precaution, remember transactions stay forever in the blockchain and direct transfers will be much easier to trace.<br />Btw have you cheched localbitcoins.com? I think it&#039;s a great way to get btc anonymously but I can&#039;t use it where I live.

				Hey,<br /><br />thanks for the answer, localbitcoins.com looks great, great tip, much appreciated. I guess i misunderstood what happens in the SR wallet. I thought it did the &quot;same&quot; thing as bitfog, making the spending/buying not 100% tracable, thus not being able to prove exactly what i spent it on.<br /><br />Thanks again, helped me out, if i knew how to give u karma i would, sry, dont know how&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />DisBandment

				Following link is quite interesting: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92709.0<br /><br />tor12345 : &quot;2. SR has a built in mixer that mixes the coins for you with no fee.&quot; <br /><br />How reliable is the SR mixer??? Does anybody know how it compares to Bitfog or Blockchain? Is there any concrete data as to how the mixing is done and what and how long logs are kept? <br /><br />This whole Bitcoin thing kinda seems untransparent.... Does anyone actually know if Bitfog is safe or not, if it actually rids all connection between you and following sales?<br /><br />Any help would, as always, be much appreciated.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />DisBandment
