				Hello everyone! I was just wondering if anybody knows why bitcoins are currently so much to buy on trading sites compared to the value they are worth on the road? For example, I use Localbitcoins and the cheapest people selling them on there are roughly £89-90 and they are only worth about £81 on SR. Its not a massive difference if you&#039;re only ordering small but for bigger orders it makes quite a bit of difference! Up until a few days ago they were roughly the same to buy as SR value. Can anybody shed any light on this?

				I should imagine it&#039;s down to a couple of things. 1) AFAIK the SR BTC price is aggregated from a couple of sources (at least, I&#039;m sure I read that when there was an announcement that they&#039;d stop using one of the market&#039;s prices, MTGox I think), so the average is then bought down by cheap rpices on some other market, maybe not in the UK. 2) The SR exchange rate is not (again, AFAIK) &#039;live&#039; and constantly being adjusted in response to instantaneous changes, so there is likely to be a lag between market prices and SR prices. 3) There seems to have been some leaning on UK markets, at least that&#039;s the impression I get by the removal of some of them (like the removal of any way to buy from the UK through Blockchain), which creates a &#039;sellers market&#039; I guess....<br /><br />I am of course happy to be corrected on either of these points if any admins wanna jump in...

				i was just gonna start a thread asking the same thing. they are currently between £91/92 atm. they usually have a bigger range of prices than that between the highest and lowest. sometimes up to £8 difference. i just went and put £72 in the bank to get coin for a £68 order and now it turns out the btc needed to make the order on sr is gonna cost me £76.50. that&#039;s nearly an extra tenner on the price of the item. anyone reckon this will change anytime soon? i really wanted my order in before it gets too late tonight.<br /><br />also coinmill got the btc rate at £82.60. i&#039;ve been getting coin on localbitcoins lately at no more than a pound over the btc price, sometimes even less than the going rate.<br /><br />update: its come down to £75.11 so here&#039;s hoping. its the btc price on the vendors page that has come down tho. the lbtc prices are still pretty much the same except one new seller has appeared at £90.49/btc<br /><br />update2: now £74.07. this could happen if i&#039;m lucky.

				Really weird<br /><br />Like you I buy btc from localbitcoins as its best place for UK. Haven&#039;t bought any in a couple weeks but it was always slightly lower cost on local compared to SR rate which was great<br /><br />Hope it goes back to normal soon, I was wanting to purchase some more!<br /><br />Maybe its a few cowboy sellers tryna make a quick buck
