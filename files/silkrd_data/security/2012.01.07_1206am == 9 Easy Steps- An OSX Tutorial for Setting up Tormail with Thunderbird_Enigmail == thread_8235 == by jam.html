				So here&#039;s my OSX Step-by-step Tutorial for Using GPG in combination with TOR-based email...<br /><br />What more could u ask for? besides your very own tor hidden<br />mailserver? its only recently this combination was even (realistically) a<br />possiblilty for the average joe i believe, no? there&#039;s at least been very<br />few free tor based email services that ive been aware of...<br /><br />but i gotz it figured out for us mac<br />users at least. if this info has already been posted, well pardon me, but i haven&#039;t<br />seen it posted/published anywhere online, except for BL, and i know my way around...<br /><br />i mean, wouldnt you ultimately prefer if you<br />had a torbased email with ZERO possibility of your IP/location<br />EVER being logged/traced from the time you sign up to....&#039;ever&#039;?<br /><br />only requires (simple) intergrated end-to-end GPG? all sent over the tor-<br />network? by looking out for others safety, you can further garnauntee your own, see?<br /><br />cuz if you could 100% eliminate the possibility of &#039;anyone&#039;<br />knowing the IP/location of even ONE of your closest friends<br />using TOR/GPG, your ultimately protecting both them AND<br />yourself...cuz ya never know...ya know? ;)<br /><br />a &#039;personally&#039; GPG encrypted mail sent over<br />tor, instead of thru a 3rd party like hush who has my/your key, IP,<br />ect?. i dunno. i think its a sweet idea. and no one has<br />published a &quot;how to&quot; guide for OSX on this, so I felt it my duty.<br /><br />if u dig it, spread it around to your<br />OSX friends. it will ultimately only increase<br />your own security. it really is the next step IMHO..<br /><br />i could add some pics if if it would help..?<br /><br />peace<br /><br />jam<br /><br />------------<br /><br /><br /><br />9 Easy Steps- An OSX Tutorial for Setting up Tormail with<br />Thunderbird/Enigmail<br /><br />Hey there phluffy..<br /><br />So there’s many ways to use GPG on OSX to encrypt your emails and<br />documents, ect, but “by golly” if I haven’t had the hardest time<br />figuring it all out. Especially in combination with a TOR-based<br />hidden email service like Tormail.net. And I’m ‘considerably’<br />computer-savvy, so I just thought perhaps there might be others out<br />there that could use some advice from what I have learned.<br /><br />It’s only recently this particular security combination was even<br />(reasonably) “possible”, specifically, the ability to integrate GPG<br />based encryption with a TOR-based hidden email service. This gives<br />both you, and (potentially) those you communicate with, the comfort<br />of knowing that the IP/location associated with your (or their) email when you<br />signed up was untraceable from the “very” start and “always” will<br />be every time you (or they) access it.<br /><br />Add 2 cups of GPG, and you really can’t get much more anonymous<br />online. Period. Using public wi-fi from a dedicated comp/usb stick,<br />using IMAP/POP3 to download/decrypt/respond and re-encrypt emails<br />offline, running all apps/storing files on a dual-<br />partitioned/encrypted usb stick (using Tails, Truecrypt, ect) and<br />perhaps some MAC-spoofing never hurts though.<br /><br />Cuz unless you wanna run your own TOR-based hidden mail server, or<br />send smoke signals or something, this seems one of the best current<br />options for the average individual wishing to TRULY communicate or<br />send encrypted files anonymously with others online. Defintlely<br />much safer than services like hushmail, safe-mail, ect, where a<br />third party still has control of YOUR “private” key…ya know?<br /><br />So in the hopes of saving some fellow mac-heads a lot of time, and<br />in the interest of harm-reduction and personal security from those<br />in the world who may be under scrutiny from oppressive governments<br />and malicious regimes out to investigate and potentially<br />incarcerate otherwise innocent individuals who have chosen to do<br />nothing more than express their god(ish) given RIGHT to do<br />“whatever the fuck they want” with their, own mind, body, and<br />soul….for them. For YOU. I write this…<br /><br />So onto the good stuff. You will need:<br /><br />1. It used to be you needed a copy of GnuPG for OSX available<br />here:<br /><br />http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/<br /><br />But as it says on their homepage, the project has been handed over<br />to:<br /><br />2. GPGTools: www.gpgtools.org.<br /><br />Just download their current bundle and you’ll get GnuPG<br />automatically installed, which is essential to get GPG workin on<br />your Mac. Unless you choose a custom install, it gets installed<br />along with:<br /><br />• Integrated GPGMail (OS X 10.5 to 10.7, Universal).<br />• Integrated GPG Keychain Access (OS X 10.5 to 10.7, Universal).<br />• Integrated GPGServices (OS X 10.6 to 10.7).<br />• Integrated GPGToolsPreferences (OS X 10.6 to 10.7).<br />• Integrated MacGPG 2 (OS X 10.5 to 10.7, Intel).<br />• Integrated MacGPG 1 (OS X 10.5 to 10.7, Universal).<br />• Integrated Enigmail (Thunderbird 3 to .<br /><br /><br />3. Next go to the Tor Project website at:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en<br /><br />Download either the “Tor Browser Bundle” (Intel-only) or the<br />“Firefox/Vidalia/Torbutton” bundle (PowerPC-friendly).<br /><br />The only difference is the Firefox bundle requires some extra<br />effort on your behalf by disabling certain plug-ins, scripts, java,<br />flash, ect that could ‘potentially’ reveal your true IP. The<br />Tor/Aurora Browser bundle comes pre-configured for your security,<br />and is therefore recommended for the uncertain. But Firefox also<br />allows you the ability to use FireGPG if you so choose.<br /><br /><br />4. Once running TOR via Firefox w/Torbutton or Torbrowser/Aurora,<br />verify you are connected to the TOR network by clicking here:<br />https://check.torproject.org/<br /><br />5. Next, get a Tormail.net email address. The Tormail.net .onion<br />address is:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion<br /><br />This is what provides you ‘location’ anonymity compared to ANY<br />other email service. Couple that with GPG and you really can’t be<br />much more secure at this point in time. (please correct me if I’m<br />wrong). Read the Tormail homepage to understand their dual web-<br />facing, anonymous-web relays, security info, ect.<br />But Tormail alone will ONLY cloak your IP adresss, and does not<br />provide you the GPG encryption essential to true anonymous<br />communication online. So the next thing you’ll need is an<br />OpenSource, IMAP/POP3 capable email client.<br /><br />6. Download Mozilla projects “Thunderbird”, an email client brought<br />to you by the ‘most def’ Firefox crew . Highly recommended,<br />although Mail.app can also apparently be used too.<br /><br />Thunderbird download: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/all.html<br /><br /><br />7. In order to integrate free, opensource GPG encryption with<br />Thunderbird/Tormail to provide true “end-to-end” email encryption<br />thru the TOR network, you’ll need Enigmail. It should have been<br />part of your GPGTools download, otherwise you can download it here:<br /><br />http://enigmail.mozdev.org/download/index.php.html<br /><br />8. Now for the ‘tricky’ part that “truly” inspired me to write this<br />article in the first place. The instructions are on Tormail.net’s<br />“Help” page, but can ‘very’ easily be overlooked. I did. Multiple<br />times. But they are ESSENTIAL!<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/help.html<br /><br />Following these instructions are truly essential to get<br />Thunderbird/GPG to work with Tormail on OSX. Reaching a TOR-based<br />hidden mailserver thru a “.onion” address is very different from<br />regular SMTP access to a mailserver. You MUST follow these<br />instructions in order to get Thunderbird to work with Enigmail/GPG.<br />PERIOD. Trust me. Just do it. Or it WILL NOT work. Period.<br /><br />Again, just read their page if you have any doubts:<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/help.html<br /><br />It’s really easy and you’ll pat yourself on the back in less than<br />10 minutes. Promise. Cuz it’s the ONLY way I know of to get Tormail<br />to work with Thunderbird/Enigmail. (But again, correct me if I’m<br />wrong.)<br />Just follow the instructions to the “T”, and you should have some<br />of the VERY best, truly anonymous, encrypted, online security you<br />could EVER hope for at this point in time on OSX. I just wish<br />someone had written this page for me, that’s all.<br /><br />In case you cant reach the original page, here are the instructions<br />for configuring Enigmail to work with Thunderbird: I’ve edited them<br />VERY “slightly” to make them simpler for most people to understand,<br />and to correct a few errors on their page. Namely, the menu-paths<br />they (mis)typed. Compare yourself if you like. I’m here to help.<br />That is all.<br /><br />http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/help.html<br /><br />Configure Thunderbird to work through Tor<br />You can use Tor Mail with Mozilla Thunderbird by following these<br />instructions.<br />You must do this or it will not work with Tor Mail.<br /><br />1. Download and Install Thunderbird.<br />2. Open Thunderbird.<br />3. Goto Thunderbird menu -&gt; Preferences<br />4. Click Config Editor button.<br />5. In the config editor filter type in<br />network.proxy.socks_remote_dns<br />6. Double click (→MAKE SURE← to double click) on it to change the<br />value from ‘False’ to ‘True’.<br />7. Close the Config Editor and click &quot;Network &amp; Disk Space&quot; tab.<br />8. Click Settings Button.<br />9. Select Manual Proxy Configuration and fill in the following:<br /><br />HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 8118<br />SSL Proxy: 127.0.0.1 Port 8118<br />Socks Host: 127.0.0.1 Port 9050<br /><br />10. Select Socks v4.<br />11. Press OK.<br />12. Press OK again on the options window to close it.<br /><br />Adding your Tor Mail account to Thunderbird<br /><br />1. Open Thunderbird.<br />2. Goto Tools -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Account Actions -&gt; Add Mail<br />Account.<br />3. Enter your name (whatever you want to be displayed, its not your<br />username), email address and password.<br />4. Press Continue, Thunderbird should download the autoconfig file<br />from us.<br />5. Click Create Account.<br /><br /><br />9. Once you’ve created and added your new Tormail addy to<br />Thunderbird, you’ll want to generate a new key pair for your<br />addresss to enable GPG encryption. One public (to share freely).<br />One private (to guard with your life).<br /><br />In Thunderbird, find your newly added Tormail addy on the left<br />menu. Scroll down and click on “OpenPGP Security” for your account.<br />Click, then click on the box next to ”Enable OpenPGP (Enigmail) for<br />this identity.”<br /><br />Also click the boxes next to: “Sign encrypted messages by default”.<br />“Encrypt messages by default”, and “Use PGP/MIME by default”.<br /><br />Go back to the OpenPGP Menu -&gt; Key Managemnt -&gt; Generate-&gt; New Key<br />pair. Find your new Tormail you want to create a keypair for in the<br />drop-down menu, and click Generate Key. Move your mouse around to<br />generate some randomness while your key is being created.<br /><br />That’s it! ☺<br /><br />You now have your own Tor-based, anonymous GPG capable email<br />enabling end-to-end GPG encryption over an anonymous TOR-based<br />mailserver/network. You’re officially a ninja!<br /><br />Thats all you need to do.<br /><br />You can ignore any messages about the connection being insecure,<br />Tor/Enigmail does end-to-end encryption to hidden services,<br />thunderbird is not aware that you are using Tor.<br /><br />If for some reason autoconfig fails, you can use the following.<br /><br />SMTP server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 25 SSL: None<br />Authentication: Normal Password<br />IMAP server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 143 SSL: None<br />Authentication: Normal Password<br />POP3 server: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion Port: 110 SSL: None<br />Authentication: Normal Password<br /><br />IMAP stores your mail on the server similar to webmail.<br /><br />POP3 downloads the messages to your PC (and usually deletes them<br />from the server after download).<br /><br />If you want to access your mail from multiple PC&#039;s then IMAP is the<br />best choice.<br /><br />POP3 may be problematic with Tor because of long delay connecting<br />and Thunderbird only tries every hour, meaning it may actually<br />never make a successful connection.<br /><br />Copyright © 2011 Tor Mail. All Rights Reserved.<br /><br />Anyways, peace. The rest ‘should’ be self-explanatory. I just hope<br />this might help someone and please pass it on to stop this<br />ridiculous WOD and honor our millions of innocent brothers and<br />sisters current incarcerated for ridiculous, non-violent drug<br />“crimes”.<br /><br />The pen (or perhaps keyboard?) truly is mightier than tha sword!<br /><br />Please respond to this thread if you have any questions or<br />corrections to my instructions if need be.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />JAM 2012<br />

				Help! I got T Bird installed but I can&#039;t get it to add my Tormail account. I have followed the instructions to the letter, and even tried the manual proxy settings on the tor &quot;help&quot; page and they won&#039;t work either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I just get a msg from T bird saying &quot;are you sure usrnm and pswrd are correct?&quot; WTF???

				@Shroomin&#039; I just had a buddy over here for 4 hours trying to config T bird to Tormail, and we still haven&#039;t had success. He is going to continue doing research. We even emailed the Tor guys with screen shots so hopefully I can get this thing going soon. If you figure anything out plz let me know asap.

				Hello StarTweaKer,<br /><br />Relax my friend.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />There is a reason we at The Flipside recommend this particular thread for those new to GPG wishing to integrate Thunderbird/Enigmail/GPG with Tormail. This method should apply to both to OSX or Window&#039;s users, as the instructions essentially apply to both platforms and (to an extent) can also be found on Tormail&#039;s website. The OP kind of &quot;put everything together&quot; for the average user.<br /><br />In our opinion, it is the the next best option to running Liberte or Tails for the average user. Preferably off a Truecrypted flash drive. Either way, this method is easier to install on any OSX in particular, since installing Liberte/Tails to run of an Apple &quot;host&quot; computer requires access to a Windows machine to be &quot;easily&quot; installed. But that&#039;s as complicated as it gets.<br /><br />Let us know specifically which OS/Version/Hardware you are running first before throwing your laptop out the window! PLEASE! ;)<br /><br />This method has worked very well for the majority of our customers, as well as many personal friends. Since we recommend this thread to new GPG users, we will certainly do our best to help you get things working using this method. Just provide some more specific details about your OS, hardware, specific &quot;error&quot; messages, current Tor/Vidalia/Thunderbird/Preferences/Plug-in&#039;s/Add-on&#039;s settings, ect.<br /><br />The community, as well as ourselves, will surely do our best to help you. :)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew<br /><br />

It says it can&#039;t find the settings for my email account or something similar.<br /><br />Please help!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Import the vendors key, then make a textfile with your address in it. Open a shell:<br />gpg --armor --recipient yourvendoremail@tormail.net --encrypt myaddress.txt<br /><br />It produces the file&nbsp; myaddress.txt.asc .. open it, cut+paste the encryption into the order box. <br /><br />The browser bundle changes the port like that guy said above everytime, but regular tor daemon install doesn&#039;t. Download the other version besides the browser bundle whatever they offer for OSX<br /><br /><br />

				First of all thank you mdmamail and flipside for helping me out with this very frustrating issue. You guys rock&lt;3&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />I currently have 13 inch aluminum Macbook (Not Pro) 2.4 GHz running OSX 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. <br /><br />As for Tor, I installed using the Tor Browser Bundle that came with Vidalia. It launches Firefox in a separate browser. I downloaded the GPG tools mentioned in this guide and due to my aforementioned issues with Thunderbird, I have been stuck at this step for a while now.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />mdmamail, I will download the Tor button for Firefox and update if/when this resolves my issue w/Thunderbird. <br /><br />Also, if either of you would like to PM me a personal guide, I would really really appreciate it&lt;3

I &quot;just&quot; woke up. sorry.)<br /><br />If you downloaded TBB the browser &quot;Aurora&quot; should open, not Firefox. Although they are essentially the same (Aurora being a &quot;pre-security configured&quot; version of FF), that is why there are 2 options, TBB or Vidalia bundle/w Torbutton, ect.<br /><br />Perhaps try reinstalling fresh? There &quot;may&quot; be conflicts if you have both Firefox and TBB installed.<br /><br />To uninstall Firefox (BACK-UP FIRST IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BOOKMARKS, PREFS, ECT):<br /><br />1. Trash the Application itself from your Application folder.<br /><br />2. Go to User-&gt;Library-&gt;Application Support. Find the Firefox folder and trash it.<br /><br />3. Go to User-&gt;Library-&gt;Preferences. Find a file called &quot;org.mozzila.firefox.plist&quot;. Trash it.<br /><br />Try to trash all &quot;Vidalia&quot; files themselves as well. Along with any TBB files. I don&#039;t recall their exact location off hand, but google it, or I&#039;m sure someone else here does. I believe Windows users get a TBB &quot;auto-uninstaller&quot;, no?<br /><br />Then try reinstalling TBB or Firefox with Vidalia/Tor button. One or the other. NOT both. This &quot;may&quot; be causing conflicts..<br /><br />If this doesn&#039;t work let us know. We will do our best to help.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />bmb,<br /><br />No Linux advice, sorry. I&#039;m sure someone here can help though. Command line is not my forte&#039;. Sorry. :(<br /><br />----------<br /><br />But as of now, until Tormail is back up and running 100%, the Tormail IMAP/POP/STMP settings in this tutorial will not apply. <br /><br />You can however still use this guide if you have an existing Tormail address. (Or a friend with a spare one laying around) ;)<br /><br />* Another temporary &quot;work-around&quot; would be to encrypt your message first in Thunderbird using GPG, then copy/paste the GPGiberish and send it using (preferably) &quot;Squirrell Mail&quot; (Tormail&#039;s &quot;non-java&quot; web service).<br /><br />This can be done with &#039;any&#039; mailserver really. It&#039;s just more work.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />The Flipside Crew<br /><br />

				Hi there ,<br />First of all thank you so much for the tutorial it was a great help in getting my head round pgp. I rsn into trouble like stated above user anme not correct. Now every time vidalia loads it uses a different SOCKS&nbsp; port , so every time i load Thunderbird i have to go to preferences network , and make sure the SOCKS port is the same as vidalia . Once i do that it works fine , very well. It s a bit of a pain changing it every time manually i was wondering is there any way so i do not have to do that&nbsp; ? I have read many different guides on the net about pgp and yours has to be the best and easiest for noobs. Thank you .<br />RP

				The second Vidalia fixed everything but now the problem is &quot; The wizard will next ask you for permission to change some settings to make sure there are no problems with signing and/or encryption.<br />Click the Yes radio button.<br />Next the wizard will detect any keys that you may have on your PGP keyring. It will show you a list of these keys. There will also be a radio button which will allow you to generate a new PGP key.<br />Click one of the keys shown to choose as a default key to use for signing and encryption. Click continue.&quot;<br /><br />It will not generate a key and I keep getting a error code.....any suggestions?

				I tried but it didn&#039;t work either. I will start the whole process all over again and hope for the best. It seemed like it was going to work but it wouldnt generate a new key...I let it run for 1hr even though it said it&#039;ll take several minutes I finally had to shut down to run some errands. Anyway thanks for the help
