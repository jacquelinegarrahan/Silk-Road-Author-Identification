				It&#039;s not really rising....&nbsp; It&#039;s only $121 on MtGox because no one can withdraw their funds from there so they are forced to buy BTC to get their funds off of that shitty website.&nbsp; They are $99 on btc-e.com and $101 on campbx.com because the price is not artificially inflated on those exchanges like they are on MtSux.&nbsp; $103 on bitstamp.net because people can cash out on there anonymously. ;)

				Jack is exactly right, mtgox is fucking people over bigtime.&nbsp; It took 2 months to get my usd wire of a few thousand, and that was back in June.&nbsp; MtGox wanted all the business so badly they made promises that were impossible to keep and they were sloppy with US law, making them lose dwolla and their other associated US banks.&nbsp; You don&#039;t see campBX having a single issue because they are playing by the rules.&nbsp; I recommend campBX as they still have dwolla and their transfers are literally instant into your account.

Plus, when coins were under $10-12, it was MUCH easier to get free shit when all of a sudden your 20 btc were worth $20....or $50. Those were the days. Much harder to make money on 4 coins versus 20+ lol

Hold on to BTC and in the long-term make, for example, 50% profits in a few months<br />or<br />b.) Buy good / cheap drugs and re-sell for 100% profit margin within 2-3 weeks.<br /><br />Kinda a no brainer for me at this point but I&#039;ll eventually start stowing away some BTC here and there.

				I wish it would go back down for a second so my transaction would finish. When I tried to buy it was at $104.11 and now its up to $106.49 so nobody will sell to me. I wonder how long I will have to wait? This is super gay&nbsp; :&#039;(
