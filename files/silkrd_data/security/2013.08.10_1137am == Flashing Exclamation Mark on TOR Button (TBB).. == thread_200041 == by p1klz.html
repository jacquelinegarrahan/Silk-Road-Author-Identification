				OK guys, I&#039;m running TBB 17.0.7 and since I logged on earlier today I&#039;ve had a flashing exclamation mark on the TOR button all day long. I thought it may initially have been an update reminder or something like that but when TOR first loaded up it made no mention of there being a new release on the TOR homepage. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure somebody here is able to help me out with working out what&#039;s causing this! And there&#039;s some good karma in it for those that do help me out with this.<br /><br />Thanks guys.

				You need to update - I had it too.&nbsp; If you use firefox you should use this time to change that too.<br />I myself searched for the word &#039;tor&#039; on my &#039;puter and deleted each tor download so I could then download a new version, I then downloaded a new version of firefox.

What you do is click Settings in the vidalia gui, then in the settings box, click on Network. Below you will see My ISP blocks connections to the TOR network. Enable that. Suddenly the Bridge settings section will appear below that. On the one line below where it says Add a bridge, copy and paste a bridge. These will look like this: 91.157.29.225:10089 After you paste one bridge, click on the green &quot;+&quot; sign and that bridge will be incorporated into the big box below that, and it will disappear from the one line. Keep copying and pasting and clicking on + until you have no more new bridges.<br /><br />You find bridges by going to bridges.torproject.org. It&#039;s pretty much self-explanatory there. Also, and I don&#039;t know if you really get different bridges or not (most of the time you don&#039;t), you can send email from either gmail or yahoo mail to bridges@torproject.org. You get some bridges by return email. Don&#039;t ask me why those good folks at the tor project selected these two miserable email providers for this.<br /><br />goblin

				Ok guys ive downloaded the new update. Then i saw a link which says &#039;How to verify signatures for packages&#039;, is this really needed, verifying sigs for the package i downloaded? <br /><br />I am trying to figure it out using&nbsp; windows command line and failing like a complete noob!lol<br /><br />Does anyone actually verify the packages they download, is it really necessary?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

Do that and post it.

Also you have to put in the entire bridge including the port number at the end after the :<br />
