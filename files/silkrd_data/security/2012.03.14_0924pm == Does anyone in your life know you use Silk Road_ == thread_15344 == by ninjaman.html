				Another thread had me thinking about this. Do you tell any of your friends, girlfriend or family that you use this site?<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve told no one except my significant other. The only reason I have is because she checks the mail around 50% of the time. It would be hard to explain the mystery packages from all around the country coming in.<br /><br />I have friends who use drugs. Friends who I trust, but for some reason, I feel that it is better to keep this one close to the chest.<br /><br />What do you think?

				im right there with you friend<br /><br />there is no reason for anyone to know about this type of thing, In all honesty the way I see it is If I cant keep a secret, I doubt the person I just told will be able to as well, so if things go accordingly that 1 person you told could spread to 100 over time, <br /><br />a small problem could come back to bite you in the ass later on so I figure that If my friends talk about it Ill say something but as of right now I am happy enough to have found this site and consider it like a present for being on the computer for a majority of my time <br /><br />

				Yes, one friend very close who I have known since I was about 6 and he introduced me to SR. Other than that no one and it&#039;s best kept that way I think. The more people who know the more chances you have to get fucked over in some way, I am ultra paranoid about security when using SR and that can only be a good thing.

				I mostly use SR to move harder-to-find psychoactives around my group of friends. Three of them know where I get them from, but they know that it&#039;s important to keep it a secret. Others just know that I can obtain these sorts of things and are happy not asking questions. I&#039;m also younger and have fewer responsibilities than most people on SR it seems, so I don&#039;t need to be as strict in my secrecy. Regardless, I&#039;ve taken care in seeing that there are no trails leading back to me.

The only person that I&#039;ve told to about SR is my significant other, as we both differ on choosing either indica or sativa dominant weed strains. For the few close friends that I sell weed to here and there, they know that I pick up from a mail order from California, or I had to drive &#039;a few states away&#039; to get some dank. I&#039;ve used mail orders that were not SR affiliated in the past, and whenever anyone asked how can I do that/where did you find that? I just told them to go and do research on google, same thing goes for SR.<br /><br />Someone actually mentioned silk road IRL when I was at a party the other night, and started chiming on about it but said he never actually figured out how to get on it. First time anyone has ever mentioned it IRL.

				In my opinion, trying to pull some fight club shit is completely redundant as there&#039;s a wikipedia article (with working links, I always go there if I lose the link lol) and if you google &quot;buy drugs online&quot; the first result is a detailed article about how to get on here. Personally I&#039;ve told a few of my friends and offered them to buy stuff for them just because I can and I try to be a nice guy. They&#039;re not as into drugs as me anyway so I&#039;ve only ordered for them once or twice.

				The two guys I live with both know about SR, one of them even uses SR along with a few of his friends. The other guy isn&#039;t a drug taker but has a pretty liberal mindset, I&#039;d trust&nbsp; both of them not to go blabbing about it to anybody. Most of my friends know as well. However as previously mentioned this could just be due to the age gap - maybe if we had a wife, kids, mortgage, career etc we might be a bit more inconspicuous. I definitely wouldn&#039;t tell anyone outside my close circle of friends though. The only thing I&#039;m worried about is that a few of these guys insist on using SR with essentially no tech security - they do things like browse Tor with Firefox extensions on their main OS with no antivirus, and don&#039;t bother with encryption. They think that simply using a Tor extension makes them technologically invincible. If any of them were ever caught it would probably compromise the rest of us as well. Oh well, fuck it, LE probably have better things to do than chase down a couple students buying weed over the internet, so I&#039;m just gonna hope for the best.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would tell absolutely nobody, NOT EVEN FAMILY. Even if you tell a close family member, they could be someone who is very reactive, and tell someone else because of the jolt of concern they have for your drug &quot;problem&quot;. And if the secret gets around to a non-blood relative (in-law), you don&#039;t want them having that info if a divorce or falling-out were to happen, cause a grudge with the family.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And another thing, some people in this thread mention their SIGNIFICANT other. This is a really big risk in my opinion. Say you have a fight with her or get caught cheating, her rage could provoke her to rat you out for revenge. Or if you break up with her, she could use this as leverage / black mail. I say &quot;her&quot; because women are more likely to act impulsively by having you arrested, even if later she was not &quot;thinking right&quot; at that time.

				I really wanted to tell everyone when I first found it but only because I was excited about finding something most people in my life would consider a myth or something.<br />I keep it to myself though. People in my life aren&#039;t really into stuff like this.

				My answer: Only one buddy who I share my purchases with. <br /><br />My rule of thumb: Always clue in anyone you live with or is housesitting for you or whatever. If they may touch or live with your mail, you kind of owe them the knowledge so they can judge for themselves if they are taking a risk. They really are not taking a risk, but that&#039;s just not your call to make. <br /><br />My curiosity: I would REALLY love to see some sort of demographic poll (it&#039;s beyond my abilities) on SR users. On one hand, one would think that younger people are more hip to the technology and whatnot, but they are also the ones who are least likely to need it (seriously, how hard is it to find a hookup when you are 19?). Older people are way way way more scared to ask around and are often more leery of any of the various pills/powders that could be contaminated, and SR provides a solution to both those problems. So is SR a bunch of young tech-savvy people, or a bunch of older users who come here for the safety? Or both? <br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t let anyone know yet, I&#039;m thinking about it, but saying I get drugs off the internet can come off, a little , dare I say it, &quot;nerdy&quot;, heh. Cool, but nerdy. Friends I share with just think I have a hookup, friend of a friend of a friend kinda thing. Thing is if I tell them about it, and they start ordering, now I&#039;m not only worried about my stuff coming thru, I would start to worry about their stuff coming thru too. And If they get scammed and all that shit. So I&#039;m leaning towards not tellling them at the moment.

				The first thing I did when I discovered silk road was email my old college roommate and tell him, you gotta check this out! I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll understand that I ordered some stuff when I invite him to do some hallucinogens. If I was a vendor maybe I would be more secretive. But plenty of people knew / have known that I have used illicit substances, so I don&#039;t think them knowing that I use silk road will add much risk. But I still probably won&#039;t broadcast it.

				No haven&#039;t told anyone. Considering telling it to a friend of mine who used to sell E&#039;s and is thinking about going back to that profession, and i really don&#039;t want to order the amounts he needs for him. He is btw on of few persons i would trust with my life. We have known each other since kindergarten been through thick and thin together so i will probably tell him. We&#039;ll see

				I&#039;ve told the people I share the mailbox with because I felt it wouldn&#039;t be too smart to have one of them pick up the mail one day and just drive around town with packages i might have gotten.&nbsp; I told them only what they needed to know to keep them safe.&nbsp; Besides that, only two IRL friends that have previously known about the Road.&nbsp; I just got to tell them I did it successfully.&nbsp; It was easy for me really because I was using TOR and Truecrypt long before I got here.&nbsp; Figured out bitcoins in a couple of days, and so the journey began.&nbsp; But I would never tell anyone if it wasn&#039;t in person.&nbsp;

				When i first found this place i got really excited. I told just a few close friends in my circle what this place was and that i discovered it.&nbsp; Although one friend i definitely did not tell, mentioned something about me getting drugs online, which i told him yeah i found some place, but it was &quot;weird, and hard to get shit off of, and i actually got scammed&quot;<br /><br />The only people that now know i&#039;ve been placing orders is my girlfriend, and my roommate, and my roommate doesnt know any kind of details, just tht i show up back at the house once every two weeks with a bag of MDMA i somehow got online. hes a really good friend tho anyways.<br /><br />I&#039;ve told some friends that i sell molly too, if they sort of ask, that i get it off a guy who gets it from a guy who gets in imported from Holland or Germany. <br />My other friends that i originally mentioned this place to I&#039;m sure can assume that im getting my shit from here, but after that one guy mentioned something I don&#039;t tell them fucking SHIT. Bastards can&#039;t keep their mouth shut about my business.<br /><br /><br /><br />To anyone wondering about telling people, SR should be kept on a &#039;need to know&#039; kinda thing. There&#039;s usually absolutely no reason why your friends need to know your ordering drugs over the internet. No good can come from that.<br /><br />Just tell them you met a dealer who only wants to deal with certain people in secrecy, and that his guy gets in super dank shit.

				The guy who I first discovered TOR+SR through knows I&#039;ve found it online, although he doesn&#039;t know my alias. I&#039;ve also told a friend of mine who&#039;s a proven pot head, and he&#039;s expressed interest in harder shit.<br /><br />I have recently been trying to fight my urge to be overly social about sensitive topics, like drugs, as I could easily get myself in trouble if I&#039;m not careful<br />I&#039;m a really social person, but I am going to be a lot more careful about who I talk to about what.
