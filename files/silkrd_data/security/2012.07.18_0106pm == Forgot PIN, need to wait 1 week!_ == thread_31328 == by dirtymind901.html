They&#039;d get half as many of these or less if everyone understood the reset process a little better.<br />1. Enter 5 incorrect PINs to lock it. At this point an automated message will be sent to you by Support, notifying you to reply &quot;in 7 days,&quot; meaning after at least 7 days, to have your PIN finally reset.<br />2. Wait 7 days. Not 4 days, not 2 days, and certainly not 5 minutes. Feel free to wait 14 days, just make sure it&#039;s 7+.<br />3. Reply and wait for new message telling you to log out and in.<br />4. Log in and set new PIN.<br /><br />Why does Support make you wait 7 days to have your PIN reset? It&#039;s in case your account has been compromised, and someone else is attempting to empty your wallet. Assuming any identifying information may be compromised with your account, the one thing Support can do is give you a week to find out that someone else locked your PIN and message them that it wasn&#039;t you, before they can take your money.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Quite simply it is your responsibility to remember your PIN. Why do so many people lack an understanding of &#039;responsibility&#039; and get all riled up when they are asked to act so?! I blame the internet. And Rock &#039;n Roll music. And the Teletubbies.<br /><br />@ Krisdanz:<br /><br />No, SR is not compromised. Well, it MAY be, but that is why we use PGP to encrypt all sensitive information. The PIN system is in place for the above reasons; namely to protect your Account from being emptied of Bitcoin should an attacker somehow gain access to it. It&#039;s in place for the protection of members - I don&#039;t see how requiring a PIN would imply that SR has been compromised though.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Regardless, act as though Silk Road IS compromised; protect all of your personal data through the use of PGP when ordering, and when discussing sensitive details with your vendor.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Grahamgreene,<br /><br />Was this new PIN addition added when SR changed addresses?&nbsp; I truly do NOT remember having to enter a pin the last time I used SR over a year ago.&nbsp; Also all my past transaction history is wiped... so I am assuming the pin is a new thing added in the last year or so? I don&#039;t remember it being there when I originally first used the site and had successful transactions.&nbsp; This is very frustrating to me.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have transferred the BTC in if I knew about this pin deal because I don&#039;t remember having a pin I am that old of an account.

There have been many changes since your last visit; perhaps you might want to take a read through the following posts / threads, and the SR Wiki:<br /><br />DPR&#039;s State of the Road Adress:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.0<br /><br />DPR&#039;s thread regarding the implementation of the PIN system:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7381.msg66166#msg66166<br /><br />DPR&#039;s post regarding transaction records and general time-frames for various things on-site:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32573.msg370788#msg370788<br /><br />DPR&#039;s thread on the new site layout:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31863.0<br /><br />DPR&#039;s post on the changes to Vendor&#039;s feedback that is viewable to buyers:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14458.msg149034#msg149034<br /><br />DPR&#039;s thread about &quot;Becoming a Fan&quot; and &quot;Bookmarking Items&quot;:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13458.msg129326#msg129326<br /><br />The Silk Road backup URLs:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32771.0<br /><br />The recently updated SR Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />The slightly updated Buyer&#039;s Guide (which there is also a version of on the Wiki):<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />You can reset your PIN via the process outlined in my post above. I understand that it may be frustrating, but it was put in place as a security measure. It&#039;s caused untold headaches for SR Support given that new users, despite being told in capital letters upon registration not to forget their PIN, regularly do.<br />As an older account, you don&#039;t have a PIN. I seem to recall that when the PIN system was introduced I was asked to create a PIN upon my login, though I may be mistaken - I&#039;m afraid my memory isn&#039;t quite as sharp as it used to be.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update this post with any further links I come upon that may be relevant to the changes introduced since you last visited SR.<br /><br />I hope the information contained here is of some use to you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene
