				I was wondering if some one could give me a walk through on how to buy BTC from other places besides silk road (where I am getting taxed 10-20%).&nbsp; Not that I don&#039;t respect and appreciate the sellers that I use on SR to get my coins from, I just want to start getting my coins from some where else.&nbsp; Really all i know at this point is that once I buy them from where ever (instabit or w.e its called and sites like that) that I need to send the coins through about 6 e-wallets to keep my self safe ( and I may be wrong on that)..so any one with knowledge on this please guide me.<br /><br />Also mtgox says I have had to many failed attempts from the same ip at logging in the past 24 hour so i wait 24 hours and change my ip and it says the same. idk what the deal is with that.

				I hope to God you used PGP.<br /><br />Hop on tor, and go to blockchain.info<br />Create a new wallet, using an identifier you will remember<br />The link for your wallet you should bookmark is blockchain.info/wallet/(youridentifier)<br />Go to bitinstant.com and select cash deposit to btc address, select a location close to you (preferably WalMart).<br /><br />-Here is where it depends on how anonymous you need/want to be. Not all of these steps are necessary for everyone.-<br /><br />IF YOU USE ANY FAKE INFO REMEMBER IT<br />Fill bitinstant in with fake, or real info and continue. Put in your blockchain.info btc address. They will transfer you to zipzap to print out your payment slip.<br />You may or may not want to use a printer that isn&#039;t traceable back to you (I&#039;ve heard this can be done, not sure).<br />Wear gloves while handling the paper if you want, and go to the place you selected. You may or may not want to wear unidentifiable clothing, sunglasses, and a hat.<br />If you go to walmart, pick up a blue sheet from the moneygram center (gloves on if you want) and fill it out. Give the worker the blue sheet/cash, and you&#039;re done.<br /><br />Go to blockchain.info and you should have bitcoins. Go to send coins, and for a 1.5% fee you can make it an anonymous send to &quot;clean&quot; your bitcoins. Whether you choose to do this is up to you. Now put in your SR address, and you&#039;re good to go.

				I tell my friends in the USA to go with a branch in another country. In this case, I&#039;ll recommend Canada. There&#039;s a quick and easy site - www.canadianbitcoins.com - which should serve you well. Doing this will help mask you.<br /><br />You will go through their system and receive a page to print. Do so, and you send this page along with the amount you specified to them via mail. I would suggest adding about 20% more than what you&#039;re buying, to account for price changes. Write a small letter letting them know you&#039;re doing this, and tell them to either add it on to your purchase or keep the change. This will also make them like you, which is always a plus. This whole ordeal, the actual buying of the bitcoins, doesn&#039;t have to be anonymous. Hell, you can walk into the office on Ottawa and buy them face-to-face if you so please. Bitcoins are NOT illegal so there&#039;s really no problem! The next stages must be.<br /><br />They will then deposit the bitcoins into the account you specified to them during the ordering process. This account should not be your SR account, as that is traceable and just downright retarded. Have them send it to a wallet. Then, you can send the bitcoins on to another wallet. (Ideally you should split the bitcoins among multiple wallets at first so the same amount doesn&#039;t get sent wallet to wallet, that can look obvious) Once done, delete the first wallet. Then send them on to your personal wallet. Delete the second wallet. This means there are two middle men between your bitcoin supplier and you. Hard to trace. Then you can send them through two more disposable wallets to your SR account.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a service called Bitcoinfog (I can find you the link if you want) which scrambles the bitcoins among hundreds of accounts over a few days then sends them out to you clean as can be. Never used it though, myself. Heard it&#039;s safe though.<br /><br />Finally, you can make your purchase on SR. It seems complicated, but it&#039;s simple and it&#039;s safe.<br /><br />Bitcoin Supply &gt; Wallet1 &gt; Wallet2 &gt; Delete Wallet1 &gt; Personal Wallet &gt; Delete Wallet2 &gt; Wallet3 &gt; Wallet4 &gt; Delete Wallet3 &gt; SR &gt; Delete Wallet4 &gt; Make Purchase.<br /><br />You can have as few or as many disposable wallets as you want. It&#039;s all personal preference.<br /><br />PM me with any questions.<br /><br />Happy Buying!<br /><br />- The Consultant
