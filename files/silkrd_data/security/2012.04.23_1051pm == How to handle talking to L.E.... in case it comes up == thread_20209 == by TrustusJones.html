				I am starting this thread due to something that was said in another thread about how a guy who got raided volunteered info to the police because he thought it would help him in the long-run.<br /><br />Some of you are experienced enough to know what I am fixing to say so this is generally directed at those people who have NEVER had a run in with L.E. or had experience with the criminal courts.<br /><br />First off you MUST know what part L.E. plays in crime and the courts. The police are directed to Protect and Serve the public. They are also directed to gather evidence that is related to a crime they are investigating. If you are approached, raided, arrested, or just shooting the bull with a Law Enforcement Officer you have the &#039;right to remain silent&#039;... if you &#039;give up&#039; this constitutional right, ANYTHING you say can be used against you in a court of law. <br /><br />All I wrote up there, 99% of you already know or have heard it before... but do you &#039;TRULY&#039; understand it???<br /><br />When a police officer is interrogating (talking to) you his ONLY goal is to gather evidence. Most cops could care less if you open your mouth unless you actually do, then you just made his/her day. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TALK TO THEM!!<br />and in ALL cases it does you NO (and I mean ZERO!!) good to talk to the police. The officer/detective questioning you has NO say so in court when it comes to your guilt or innocence or really even your sentencing... once you plead out you will never even see the cop/detective again. His ONLY role is to TELL the court what &#039;YOU SAID&#039; if it goes to trial. If you kept your mouth shut then the ONLY thing he can testify to is what he saw or what he wrote in his notes, and since he is an Officer of the Court his word is GOLDEN!<br /><br />When it comes to &#039;cutting a deal&#039;, that comes from the state or federal prosecutor... and in the case of the Feds that can only come from the judge... Federal Prosecutors &#039;can&#039; ASK for a deal as part of a plea bargain but the Judge &#039;DOES NOT&#039; have to accept it.<br /><br />I have tried to be a plain as possible as this is a VERY VERY important topic. You MUST get your mind right now... stand in front of the mirror and repeat over and over till it is second nature:<br /><br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br />I WANT A LAWYER<br /><br />Since asking for a Lawyer is your constitutional right then asking for one at the time of your arrest CAN NOT be used against you later... the judge is not going to throw the book at you for asking for a lawyer... BUT! he damn sure can throw it at you for confessing.<br /><br />I hope I have helped you understand why it is SO important to NOT talk... <br /><br />Good Luck,<br />TJ

				Sound advice. No good ever comes from talking to L.E. because anything you say can and will be used AGAINST you. It is never used for you. The only time the things you say can be used for you are in court, not when talking to police.

				Great post.<br /><br />I know there&#039;s this dude on youtube who makes long videos all about LE and your rights when encountering cops. He makes vids on all sorts of scenarios like house parties, walking on the street, being in a car, etc., and he tells you what to do and what not to do. Great guy, name slipped my mind.

				Good things to remember, here are more:<br /><br />SEARCH WARRANTS<br />Never let a police officer into your home without a search warrant. If they have one, check the address, date &amp; the judge&#039;s signature. If the police knock at your door, step outside and close the door behind you. Do not leave the door open. If they enter your home to search say. &quot;I DO NOT CONSENT TO A SEARCH.&quot;<br /><br />IF YOU ARE STOPPED BY POLICE<br /><br />Remember these lines:<br /><br />1. &quot;Officer, am I free to go?&quot;<br />2. &quot;Officer, I do not consent to any searches.&quot;<br />3. &quot;Officer, I want to speak with a lawyer.&quot;<br /><br />ALWAYS be polite yet assertive. Never escalate a situation. <br /><br />DO NOT CONSENT<br /><br />If a police officer asks to search your car, politely say &quot;I DO NOT CONSENT TO A SEARCH&quot;<br /><br />If the&nbsp; officer asks if you&#039;re hiding something say, &quot;I BELIEVE IN MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY, AND I DO NOT CONSENT TO A SEARCH&quot;.<br /><br />

				if the LE knocked on my door i wouldnt even go out side to talk to them cuz they can just be like ooo i smell pot whether or not the actually do. they will try n find a way to coerce their way in if you give them that opening and their there to fuck with u. if on the off chance their there for a reason like to ask if you have seen some fishy shit or any reason at all you have no obligation to open the door. they can knock all day till their hands hurt, i wont answer the door. if they have a good reason to come in theyll have a warrant and kick that door off the hinges. and if that ever happened i will remain silent to give my attorney more to work with. i have no reason to ever talk to LE unless i were to be pulled over for accidently speeding or get into a wreck. even then i will only be polite and answer questions pertaining to the situation and never volunteer extra information like where im going or coming from.

				TrustUs is correct and giving some damn good advice here- the main thing as well is not to raise suspicions and act erratic either if or should the police come knocking at the door. Act normal and address them in a calm manner so they do not detect any stress, etc. in your voice. IF they do indeed have a search warrant make sure that you do not have a bunch of evidence laying around the house like packages from SellerX with your name, address, etc on it. One of the things that I ALWAYS make sure to do when a package comes in is make sure to take the sender label as well as receiving address information off the package. I ALWAYS open my package in the bathroom and make sure to flush these two things straight down the toilet- the package is then ran through the shredder shortly after. The only thing kept in my house is a personal stash of a few Norco&#039;s and nothing more. <br /><br />Protect yourselves people. If they come knocking at the door they most likely have a legit suspicion- don&#039;t give them any reason to validate it. &quot; I have no idea or knowledge what you are talking about officer and I am sorry that I cannot help you&quot; and if they start threatening with any sort of evidence such as bank deposits, transactions, etc. &quot;That will be all officer I need a lawyer present as again I have no knowledge of what you speak of and will not incriminate myself&quot;. <br /><br />I know some folks purchase mad heavy shit off here- please, be safe. IMO the free product offers, etc. are not worth it.

				It&#039;s terribly unfortunate this is so widely unknown. <br /><br />If you watch any COPS kind of show, they ALWAYS go for the CONFESSION! That&#039;s all they want. <br /><br />They will lie to you, con you, scare you with any kind of bull shit that might be only half true, not at all true, or sort true or whatever. NEVER EVER CRACK!<br /><br />They spend their WHOLE CAREERS learning methods of interrogation. <br /><br />Hold your ground. I&#039;ve heard of various CD&#039;s and the peeps held held held it. Nothing further was done. No bringing in. Nothing. Remember that. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Add this to your mantra:<br /><br />&quot;I do not consent to any search of my person or property.&quot;<br /><br />Never physically resist, but always make it known that all police actions are against your consent. As I understand it, even many warrants are limited in their scope, so repeatedly making clear that you give NO consent should, in theory, limit what they are doing to whatever is in the warrant.<br /><br />Whether or not they respect that is another story.

				I&#039;m not very knowledgeable about criminal justice systems outside of the United States, but for those who live here:<br /><br />Never speak to the police unless to request a lawyer or express that you do not consent to a search<br /><br />And watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc

				another line to keep in your arsenal:<br /><br />if pulled over while driving, or approached by LE while in a car, if the cop asks you to step out of the vehicle, the proper response is:<br /><br />&quot;are you just asking me to step out, or am i legally obligated to step out?&quot;<br />my friend who practices law here in the US told me this<br /><br />if a drug dog is called to the scene, they will ALWAYS search.&nbsp; because the defendant (victim) doesn&#039;t know the &quot;signal&quot; that the dog gives to alert, the cops will always claim that the dog alerted, whether it did or not.&nbsp; even if you think your car is clean DO NOT consent to a search. politely say &quot;I would like to reserve all of my rights, if I am not free to go, then I want my lawyer present.&quot;<br />

BUT! he damn sure can throw it at you for confessing.<br /><br />I hope I have helped you understand why it is SO important to NOT talk... <br /><br />Good Luck,<br />TJ<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This post is almost condescending, I had hoped that if people had ventured so far as to illegally order drugs in the mail or commit any felonies for that matter would know the golden rule for all criminal activity, the first commandment if you will, keep your mouth shut and always have a lawyer present during questioning, but how does it go-&quot;been around the world and only stupid people are breeding&quot;. No offense OP, just having a little fun...but really, come on.
