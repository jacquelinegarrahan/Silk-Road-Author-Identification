				After almost 2 days of being able to log on successfully asked a mod on the forums what to do.<br />I took the advice and opened a new account on SR and contacted support and explained what had happened. <br />I will be extremely upset if my account is gone, there was BTC in the wallet and outstanding orders that were in transit. <br />I had a great reputation (stats) as well.<br /><br />I have no idea how i could&#039;ve been hacked. The only thing is i ordered from a new RX vendor who i have never ordered from before, but they had good feedback. <br /><br />Any chance i will get my account restored?! I still have an order en route!!!! i need to be able to finalize and don&#039;t want to lose my stats because of some hacker! <br />More importantly, what could have been done so that this didnt happen?! I cant think of anything i couldve done to put my account in jeopardy.<br /><br />PLEASE BE CAREFUL GUYS, I DIDNT THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.<br />stay safe on SR and if anyone has any advice or this has happened to them please post.

				Why do you say phished?<br />That&#039;s where you log onto a fake site &amp; put in all your details thinking its the real site.<br />The hidden wiki has a link to a phishing SR site but it asks you to input your pin number at the login screen. Did you do this?<br /><br />If you did then your BTC are gone. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know what&#039;s happened but as you say phished I&#039;m supposing that you unknowingly gave away your SR username, password &amp; pin. If so give them up nothing you can do about it now.<br /><br />For the future remember NEVER give your pin at the login screed &amp; be aware of the authentic SR URL.

If a keylogger was planted on your computer, they could steal your password and pin when you made an order. This happened to someone I know. He lost all the BTC in his account.<br />

				^^^ Def do this!<br /><br />If you have a key logger you will need to do a HD format and reinstall the OS as well, they are a bitch to get rid of. <br /><br />Hope support has gotten back to you and you have regained control of your account.
