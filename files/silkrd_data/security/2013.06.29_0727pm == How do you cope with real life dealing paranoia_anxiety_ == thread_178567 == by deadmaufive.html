				I&#039;m sure we have very successful dealers in these forums.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing it for less than 5 years, and I am starting to have a very solid clientele base and starting to get paranoid all the time. I have a bunch of regulars who helps their friends pick up as well. When i go to clubs people that i never met before come up to me and ask because of word of mouth. I don&#039;t do large amounts, I am more of a peddler if anything.<br /><br />Guys who have been doing it for 5+ years..what techniques or rules you follow to keep you from being hidden from the radar?<br /><br />Comon guys, lets do up a SR version of the 10 crack commandments!!!&nbsp; ;D

				If you already have a good group of people that you regularly sell to, then don&#039;t gain anymore customers.<br />Safety &gt;&gt; Greed<br />If someone you don&#039;t know comes up and asks you for shit, you have no idea what they&#039;re talking about.<br />Sell only to Friends and Friends of Friends only when the friend is present.<br />Make sure your friends know the ramifications and what to do if they&#039;re caught.<br />Keep all drug communications to a minimum, phone calls only, text if you really need to, but make sure there&#039;s no identifying info in the text.<br />If someone makes your life difficult selling to them, cut their asses off(but in a nice way so they don&#039;t come after you, like &quot;i&#039;m out, sorry&quot;) Your security and life are already hectic as fuck, you don&#039;t need some asshole dictating what you do.<br />You call the shots; where to meet and when, price, who comes with them, etc.<br /><br />If a situation seems sketch, THEN IT PROBABLY IS, GET OUT FAST.<br /><br />FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS, THEY&#039;RE RIGHT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.

				1 - Make sure you have a life and interests and friends independent of your dealing.&nbsp; It helps maintain perspective &amp; provides a model for normalcy and innocence.<br /><br />2 - Recognize that you&#039;ve been throrough and systematic in your security practices. Remind yourself that it&#039;s a waste of time and energy to keep revisiting things you&#039;ve already taken precautions against. Your attention is better spent elsewhere - see #1. <br /><br />3 - Try (as much as possible!) not to use drugs to escape the anxiety - especially if they&#039;re the sort that lead to paranoid thinking. Learning how to manage your emotional states on your own is far more valuable.&nbsp; Practice getting yourself into a state of extreme anxiety, and then calming yourself down, either by deep breathing or talking yourself down.&nbsp; The ability to be calm under pressure is something that can be learned - and (imo) is something worth learning.<br /><br />4 -&nbsp; Take up a martial art, or any practice that involves self discipline and self control. The skills you develop can be used to help manage paranoid and anxious thoughts. <br /><br />5a&nbsp; -&nbsp; Trust no one. Everyone is (potentially) a cop. If you&#039;re panicking or run into a problem that you can&#039;t deal with on your own, do your best to find a way to discuss it anonymously. <br /><br />5b -&nbsp; Find someone you *can* trust &amp; who can help keep you sane.&nbsp; (Ideally this person will be a mentor - someone who has been in the game longer than you &amp; who can coach you through certain phases - but it&#039;s not necessary). <br /><br />6 -&nbsp; Get clear about your values. Be honest with yourself about what it is you&#039;re doing &amp; what it&#039;s worth to you. Know what you stand fo, what you&#039;re willing to compromise, and what it is you believe in. Doing this will help keep the anxious thoughts to a minimum.<br /><br />7 -&nbsp; Make a plan and stick to it. How long do you want to continue dealing? How long, realistically, do you think you&#039;ll be able to do so without getting caught? Either set a time frame or pick a number &amp; work on how you&#039;ll get there. It&#039;s another good way to help you focus your thoughts and to keep things from seeming too out of control. <br /><br />8 -&nbsp; Remember to take vacations. There&#039;s a reason why most countries make holidays mandatory for employers, and dealing is one of the most stressful jobs out there.&nbsp; Getting out of town for a little while is rarely a bad idea &amp; can do wonders at clearing your head. <br /><br /><br />Note: This list simply addresses how to cope with anxiety &amp; paranoia, &amp; presumes you&#039;ve already done what you can (within reason) at a practical level to keep yourself safe - which is another topic entirely. :)<br />

				Hi mate, Well first of all, people in this thread have already given you some great advice. <br />I stopped all the dealing aspects a while back, But was in fairly deep. Now i cant give out details but i have been around the block. <br />My advice to you is this. <br /><br />Never ever forget it is you who is dealing not your friends not anybody else, it might eb great to have a best buddy you can talk to but keep business seperate, friends are always curious to know, how much you buy or sell, want to hang out when you need to be going to your stash etc, and sometimes (even in my head) you almost go ahh just come with me. But never ever do it. Because one day, they might just think, well he isnt there, i know where his stash is, he wont know it was me who took it, and whether you find out or not who it was , your money and product is gone, not only that, you have a &quot;friend&quot; who thinks or knows they cant get away with this regularly. I knew a guy who i thought was ok for a while, he ended up stealing from me once, i caught him and sorted it out, but that is a different story. anyway he had the mindstate of, Hes doing fine making loads, loads of product customers, i have fuck all, he doesn&#039;t care about me really, i want to get in the game, i could do that. jealousy really. everybody wants to be the cool dealer guy. Stay away from that bullshit.Look at it as you are going to work , you have friends for after work, you woulden&#039;t leave the office to go chill with friends, or youd lose your job pretty quick.<br /><br />Stay paranoid. Always! Your instincts are more than often correct. DO NOT let greed tempt you. Its easy to think no , but a couple thousand in front of you always seems enticing, never go for it if you have a bad feeling. <br /><br />Change phones every 2 - 3 weeks . Seriously. they dont cost much especially if you are dealing. it takes 20 minutes to call people and say new number, or send out a mass text. i have seen plenty people keep the same number because their &quot;klientele&quot; have it and they dont want to change.<br /><br />Dont keep amounts in your own house, even if it is buriend in a field, Tied up a tree, In an ivy bush against a wall of a house , In a gutter in a lane, In bush somewhere. there are endless stashes, dont keep it in the house. <br /><br />Dont do drugs untill you are at home or out with mates on your own personal time, walking around selling drugs while in drugs is stupid and will get you pulled over, stop searched, jacked or another thousand things.<br /><br />Keep away from people who are friends with people you dont like. I dont care how friendly and how much you like &quot;jack&quot;. he is friends with &quot;chris&quot; and &quot;sean&quot; who happen to be pains in the arses, stick up kids, you get the picture. Sooner or later they will all be fucked up and needing shit from somewhere, it can only go bad.<br /><br />Look for proffesional klientele. I had teachers, lawyers, guys that work in bars, an ex captain of a fishing boat etc. usually older people are more trustworth and not idiotic teenagers with blades and guns. <br />they all had shit to lose, so they didnt want trouble, they want the stuff i want the money, friendly chat , money , stuff, take care see you soon.Mature people. Great.<br /><br />stick to products you know, eg dont sell heroin if you dont know jack shit about it. how do you know if its good or not? problems arise way too easy from this. Same as MDMA, if you have taken it once, and think it is good, somebody who takes it every fortnight or so might think it is shit. you get the picture. <br /><br />Try to avoid selling heroin and crack, Usually a dodgier game and you have to deal with more unsavoury people. (not to say you wont deal with them otherwise, but you get the picture)<br />this also goes for street deals, try not to be selling 20 and 10 bits/bags on the streets, more money , maybe, But its also more sales and more chance of getting caught (if u get caught with deals you are fucked you will be convicted of supplying or intent to supply), stabbed and a whole lot more. <br /><br />Dont let anyone know where you live. Obvious reasons, I like to be able to go home at night not having to watch for people kicking in my door. <br /><br />If you get big, you will have to expand, and people will get jealous, not friends, not street dealers but big fish. If this ever happens, do not try and be tony montanna, be calm, mature and explain what your doing straight up, dont bullshit these guys they will see straight through it. try to avoid going into business with them as well, they can fuck you over easy and there wont be much you can do unless you want to wait in the shadows on them leaving their houses and blow people away. Maybe that isnt a problem for you, But maybe it is i dont know, either way its hassle that can be avoided.<br /><br />if you are over thinking things and being paranoid, good, but think calmly, look at whats realistic, worst case scenarios, best case scenarios and everything else, so you know what to do when it happens.<br /><br />Dont daydream, shit happens when you daydream and passes you right by, you can see things happening when you ay attention . STAY ALERT.<br /><br />never get comfortable, people think because they have nevr been caught, that they will never get caught. Do not get comfortable this is the biggest mistake you could ever make. <br /><br />Dont ever do things when your drunk or in a zone from music etc, it may seem like a decent thing to do, but in the morning, you will be sober and thinking jesus what the hell did i do.<br /><br />again.. do not mess with dickheads. stay away from friends it only ends up bad i promise you. never get comfortable with them. even best friends turn into worst enemies. <br /><br />hope this helps

				My golden rule that has kept me from being busted while waves of people have been taken down around me by LE is that I don&#039;t give the drugs directly to a person in direct exchange for cash and I do not sell to anyone other than my friends.&nbsp; If my friend tells me that he has a guy who wants to pick up, I tell him that he will be the one picking up the stuff for his friend.&nbsp; This way there are no shady transactions and people don&#039;t actually get the stuff from me.&nbsp; This generally helps put a damper on the word of mouth spreading.&nbsp; Although, it may not fit your situation perfectly.

				The anxiety made me get out of the game and instead use my compsci degree to code store software and phones. <br />Sucks sleeping with one eye open knowing you have 8KG of MDMA crystalline badly hidden in your place. <br /><br />I got a safe house after that, basically found some international student on craigslist and paid them cash to rent a room I hid drugs in behind the walls vac + mylar sealed. Even that was too much anxiety so I stopped. <br /><br />

There are plenty out there, They dont have to be pablo escobar to be a kingpin.<br /><br />always do things for the long run not for the short term, usually works out better.

				Idealy distance yourself from things so that the most you will suffer is a financial loss. Takes time to get to that level<br />and just be aware that stuff can go wrong so no point worrying about when it will happen. Of course do all you can <br />to minimize the chances of this. <br />Can&#039;t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen .
