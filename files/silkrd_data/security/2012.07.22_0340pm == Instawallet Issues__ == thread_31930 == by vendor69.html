				I have recently transferred some btc around instawallet wallets. i have also taken some coins off of the site to instawallets. <br /><br />Even though this was a few hours ago nothing has shown up. Also, the coins that were moved around instawallets are still showing up as unconfirmed and will be confirmed in 20 minutes. (Again a few hours like this).<br /><br />Normal transaction times are less than half an hour. Any ideas what this might mean? I saw someone calling scam but could it just be a hold up? Or could LE have made them halt all transactions?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				I really hope you guys havn&#039;t been scammed, but is there a reason you can&#039;t just use the official Bitcoin client? It&#039;s easily the safest.

				FUCK, this just happened to me. I think I just got scammed by instawallet. I deposited about 5 BTC into my instawallet page, I waited several hours and the transaction was confirmed in my bitcoin application, but still nothing in instawallet. So I checked the instawallet address over at http://blockexplorer.com/. The transaction showed up. So I though oh well, I&#039;ll just go to sleep and they&#039;ll probably show up in the morning.<br /><br />When I wake up, the bitcoins are still not there, and now there is a transaction that sent my bitcoins to some random address that is not mine. What the fuck? Has this happened to anyone else? Is instawallet scamming people? Vendor69, I suggest you check your instawallet on blockexplorer. If there is a transaction that sent your bitcoins to somewhere else, I think we are out of luck.

				Paste your instawallet bitcoin address at http://blockchain.info/ or http://blockexplorer.com/. It&#039;ll show all the transactions associated with that address.

				I&#039;ve done that and i can see where the account received the money and then it leaves the account afterwards to another address.<br /><br />If i go to the instawallet URL it still shows the money there but as unconfirmed.<br /><br />What the fuck?<br /><br />I have posted this in the SR Discussion Forum too to get some more views. I imagine this could fuck a lot of people :(
