				As long as you encrypted your address when communicating with vendors it shouldn&#039;t really matter, even if SR was compromised.

				Since they implemented the &quot;semi-anonymous&quot; feedback system, I&#039;d imagine it would be at least &#039;slightly&#039; harder for them to prove who sent anything to anyone in particular based on that alone.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />

				But since a members personal shipping details/names, ect are deleted immediatly upon being shipped, that shouldn&#039;t be too much of a concern. And they&#039;re not gonna go after buyers who may have bought a &#039;10-strip&#039;, even yesterday. They know, as well as we do, that it most likely would be long since ingested (err...deleted), and with no shipping trail, is probably nothing to be concerned about. ESPECIALLY if you encrypt your details to the vendor using GPG. <br /><br />Using a Privacybox.de allows ANYONE to do just that, whether you are still learning GPG or not. You only need the vendors public key to use GPG to encrypt your personal info to them. We feel every vendor should add one to their page (if you trust the vendor), to offer a &quot;one-way&quot; method for ANY member to auto-encrypted a GPG message (and/or shipping info) to them. But you&#039;re on your own if you want a GPG encrypted reply without having GPG installed.<br /><br />Although, if you search for our recent &quot;Countermail removing private key from server&quot; thread, there &#039;may&#039; be workarounds. The only weakness with CM is Java, but I&#039;ve read elsewhere there are friends of us all working with CM trying to get an Opensource applet to be be released. Time will tell I suppose?<br /><br />But using locally installed GPG (preferably on a Truecrypted flash drive), is of course, still preferable. Just a &#039;possible&#039; option. Especially since CM doesn&#039;t log IP&#039;s, and actually forces you to to keep your public key private from the start. You must &#039;manually&#039; upload it to a keyserver (or preferably just send it only to those you choose?). I like that. The usb key option they offer is nifty as well. And from our research so far, (compared to Hush), Swedish laws CAN force them to hand over specific emails. But as long as you create your own keypair, they&#039;ll only ever get GPGiberish. &quot;If&quot; you trust their applet (which many have reviewed so far), but ESPECIALLY if it get&#039;s released as Opensource. Just sayin&#039;... ;)<br /><br />Peace
