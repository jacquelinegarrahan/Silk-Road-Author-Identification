				I&#039;ve searched and checked other threads....My question(s) is; I&#039;ve been using BitInstant the time i&#039;ve been on SR, but I haven&#039;t needed to really put more than $500 worth of BTC on my account at one time.&nbsp; That&#039;s the limit per transaction for BitInstant.&nbsp; If i were to use their services today, and get on my blockchain and setup another payment slip, could i do another $500 transaction in the same day?&nbsp; Anyone try this before?<br /><br />Also, I know its not supported, but if there is a LEGIT RELIABLE BTC vendor on here that has the reputation to back it, that&#039;s also pretty quick, who might they be?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read about Sugar Mama but it seems as if she&#039;s on vacation for the time being.

				Yeah I&#039;ve read in the forums that someone was able to split up their large payment into several bitinstant transactions.&nbsp; Did they use all the same information for each slip, I have no clue but I think it can be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As to other way of obtaining BTC, I&#039;ve never used them but I hear good things about blue sky traders.

				Just for verification purposes....Incase anyone else wonders.. Yes you can do multiple transactions to BitInstant in a single day.&nbsp; Just those transactions cannot exceed 2,000 after all said and done.&nbsp;

				Thread unlocked. Not sure why it was locked in the first place but I presume it was a simple moderator error.<br /><br />Libertas

				JumboMonkeyBiscuit is a very reputable BTC vendor. I used them once and found them to be super friendly and helpful. And they charge a little less than Sugar Mama (15%). Had my coins in less than an hour. Not currently using them because they&#039;re only accepting orders of more than $500, which is no help to me, but you might find it useful.
