				So is their a major difference between the different versions of Linux, such as Linux Mint, Liberte, etc in terms of security, with Liberte being one of the most secure, or does it all just depend, with the difference being how you encrypt and use it?

				There are big differences between the security provided by different linux distros. Liberte is based off of hardened gentoo, which is probably the distro of Linux with the most security potential, however I don&#039;t believe Liberte is properly taking advantage of what hardened gentoo has to offer.

				You should download backtrack. It&#039;s mainly used on a USB drive as a live environment, but there are ways to do a full install on the flash drive. Backtrack is very secure, and if you&#039;re worried about security having your evidence on a flash drive is great. It&#039;s easy to hide, and easy to physically destroy if need be. Also, they&#039;re cheap.

Hardened Gentoo provides tools that require both the proper version of the OS (ie: 64 bit) and proper configuration to take advantage of. Using Hardened Gentoo without the proper settings and configuration does not take advantage of what it has to offer.

				The best way to determine linux version security is:<br /><br />-what does it install by default? <br />-how committed are they to releasing patches in a timely manner? do they have enough devs to do this or is it a 2-man show?<br />-what security history do they have?<br />-is it focused on noob users who want nothing but graphical interface? then it&#039;s probably insecure as it&#039;s just trying to be a windows or apple clone.<br />-do the kernel devs focus on trusted code auditing or are they rapidly releasing shit like Linus Torvalds?<br /><br />Of course you can take any version of linux and lock it down yourself but easier to get a blank install with nothing enabled, then you have to make it insecure but activating shit instead of finding shit to turn off. If the NSA/CIA/Secret Service or Scotland Yard, or hired criminal hackers aren&#039;t after you for being Scarface or Mega Carding Kingpin, then you&#039;re prob fine with any linux installation. If worried disable X-windows and lock down everything else. <br /><br />Or look into other operating systems like OpenBSD or shit like this:<br />http://www.scs.stanford.edu/histar/<br /><br />Here&#039;s an article about it, Nikolai is an MIT comp sci prof now<br />http://soe.stanford.edu/research/profiles/infotech_mazieres.html<br /><br />Only 17,000 lines of code?!?! Compare that to a typical linux distro with millions of lines of code. <br />OpenBSD also audits absolutely everything so you have a trusted code guarantee. <br /><br />Security is about trusted audited code running on trusted audited hardware, and constant vigilence to patch and update your system, adapt to new threats, run behind a pf firewall running carp, and a whole host of sociology like not giving away who you are easily. Bruce Schneir&#039;s blog covers a lot of this.
