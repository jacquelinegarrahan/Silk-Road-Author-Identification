				If you are trying to hide it from a dog and you are a daily smoker then this is not going to work.&nbsp; If you have residue on your hands then this will not work either.&nbsp; A hair straightener or a flat iron can seal a moisture barrier bag.&nbsp; Moisture barrier bags have more layers than just mylar.&nbsp; Look at something like Dri Shield 3000 or 5000.

				Dealer where I live keeps pounds of dope in large ziplock freezerbags and then tosses them into tupperware containers. Somehow no smell, all the rest of the dealers I know use giant glass jars, like the one&#039;s you see in Chinese medicine shops. No smell either. Get the one&#039;s with rubber top designed to be resealable and air tight.

				Yeah those will work good if your weed will fit in there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why do you need to keep the smell from leaking out?&nbsp; Is your weed smelling up your house?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				LOL&nbsp; That&#039;s cool I thought you had some pounds stinking up your place or something!&nbsp; I would think that any of the foil bags with a ziplock seal will work fine for that purpose.&nbsp; But street dealing is the most risky way of doing it and &quot;pushing&quot; makes it sound like you are going around approaching strangers.&nbsp; Where I live, street people will stand next to you and say &quot;nuggets&quot; to let you know they are selling weed but that shit is hella risky!
