				This will be my first and last post. Listen carefully.<br /><br />In the coming months, top shipping vendors need to be very careful.<br />Vendors with the most sales (tony76, Noriega, Rocker, etc.) will be targeted specifically. <br />THIS DOES NOT MEAN LOW RANKING VENDORS WILL BE SAFE.<br />This message is directed at ALL vendors.<br /><br />Once agents have received packages, surveillance will be placed around shipping areas from the vendor&#039;s postal code, after which multiple orders will be placed. LE accounts will be very hard to differentiate from normal accounts. They are smart and know that previous orders matter. They have been trained to trick you.<br />From there, they will be doing everything in their power to match shipment dates/locations to faces that they have on video depositing packages.<br />BE SMART. Multiple drop areas with multiple people delivering can only make it harder to be caught.<br />REMEMBER: You do not have to be caught to be watched. Matching up on camera to ship dates multiple times will be bad for business.<br />If you switch up your methods often, you will be extremely hard to catch. Their funding only goes so far.<br /><br />Obviously funding will be more heavily directed to vendors of more interest.<br />Once again ALL VENDORS need to be careful.<br />It will only take one large bust on national news about drug dealers operating on a website that does not even have an age requirement to receive a large increase in funding.<br /><br />Note: I do not have the list of vendors to be watched. The vendors previously listed may or may not be targeted, I do not have the specifics. I simply went to drugs and sorted by seller rank. Simple as that, and now you have a list of the most valuable targets. <br /><br />Take my advice, or don&#039;t. But you would be a fool not to believe this is being discussed in the planning room daily.<br />Most of what I have said is common sense. USE IT. DO NOT GET COMPLACENT.

				This all sounds like pretty obvious advice. Maybe you&#039;re not going to come back OP, but it would help if you would say why you&#039;re showing up with this information now. Do you expect some sort of DEA attack on the Silk Road in the next few months? What makes you think that their efforts will be stepped up in the slightest?

				I don&#039;t see how this strategy would be feasible unless sellers are incredibly lazy. Mailboxes are everywhere, and I imagine in the time it would take to receive an order, the seller should be using a different location. Heck, if I sold, I&#039;d never use the same box twice, and I&#039;d be driving all over the place to make my drops.<br /><br />Good advice for anyone not already doing this.

				I must be honest i thought the same when i read &quot;post code&quot;<br /><br />But it just made me think, concidering all the survalance technology thats about &quot;they&quot; dont seem to find many people. Look at all the terorists/murderers/rapists that are around. Also the amount of money it takes to do this survalance.<br /><br />I think the message is scare mongering. i know iv not been here long but still. It may be someone from a rival site or even a rival or up comming vendor in my eyes.<br /><br />stay safe<br /><br />skunky :D

				Sometimes I wonder if the people that start these ridiculous over-paranoid threads are actually just LE, and this is the best they can do. They have no funding to actually take anyone down, so instead they just try and make forum posts to get everyone all riled up. Even all those thread posts about TFM, even though there were already like 100 of them, I wonder if some LE just showed up, made a quick account, and tried to link to that story as much as possible to scare us. Because they know that TFM was an easy takedown; they just had to ask hushmail to hand over the records and they did. But with the Silk Road, they know it&#039;s not that easy. It would take a massively funded operation, and they just don&#039;t have it. I mean the more I look at it, the more I see that the DEA and FBI and whoever else just aren&#039;t trying to take down the Silk Road, not at all. They have much bigger fish to fry what with the drug violence going on near the Mexican border and literally pounds of heroin and cocaine and that sort of thing getting illegally smuggled into the country everyday. You see the occasional (very rare) story about some buyer who gets picked up because of bad packaging or something, but that&#039;s it. They&#039;re not specifically targeting anyone. If you&#039;re even remotely smart and secure about what you do here, you&#039;re golden.

				Note that OP used Postal Code. British people use Post Code. OP is likely Canadian.<br /><br />BUT- the UK is a likely target to begin weeding out vendors.

				Having found I don&#039;t really give much of a fuck what I say, I&#039;ll toss this out there.<br /><br />Its not by any means uncommon for multiple countries to work together. Something as major as the SR can&#039;t stay underground forever. Its not going to happen. I know it. You know it. I&#039;ve accepted it. What the worlds governments do with this information is, obviously, uncertain. Drug&#039;s are illegal. Why? Because it pays bills. If drugs were all legalized, do you realize how many LEOs would be shit out of luck for employment? I know my topics are bouncing around, so are my thoughts, bear with me. I know by this point most of you are like &quot;Why am I reading this? Negative karma.&quot; But that&#039;s okay. Now, where was I, ah, yes, major vendors. The biggest vendors should definitely have a few people delivering packages for them. Mix that shit up. It helps. If bob goes to the post office, and the cops are expecting frank, well, they&#039;re spending money and wasting time. Personal security is also a biggie. Having someone to watch your back is always a good thing. Always. Now, I&#039;ll end this long, drug induced post by saying this. The fact that you&#039;re on this site right now is a testament to the security measures put in place by the admin of the site. :)

The problem with driving is that there are license plate scanning networks in many cities (and if it isn&#039;t where you live yet it probably is coming soon). They use a combination of stationary scanners and mobile scanners on police cruisers that record license plates and the location the cruiser is at when it records the license plate. In some cities they keep records of license plate positioning info indefinitely. <br /><br />So if they order from a vendor a few times and can pinpoint the area they are sending from and the rough time they sent, they could query their license plate positioning database and intersect the vehicles detected in these locations during those time frames, and it may be possible for them to narrow in on the vendors vehicle after enough orders, especially if the vendor ships from several different locations with significant distance between them (less noise in the crowds since the vendors movements will be fairly random and most peoples movements fit into patterns).

The killer sped off in a silver Pontiac, but a witness was able to write down the license plate number.<br /><br />Police figured out the name of the suspect very quickly. But locating and arresting him took a little-known investigative tool: a vast system that tracks the comings and goings of anyone driving around the District.<br /><br />Scores of cameras across the city capture 1,800 images a minute and download the information into a rapidly expanding archive that can pinpoint people’s movements all over town.<br /><br />Police entered the suspect’s license plate number into that database and learned that the Pontiac was on a street in Southeast. Police soon arrested Christian Taylor, who had been staying at a friend’s home, and charged him with two counts of first-degree murder. His trial is set for January.<br /><br />More than 250 cameras in the District and its suburbs scan license plates in real time, helping police pinpoint stolen cars and fleeing killers. But the program quietly has expanded beyond what anyone had imagined even a few years ago.<br /><br />With virtually no public debate, police agencies have begun storing the information from the cameras, building databases that document the travels of millions of vehicles.<br /><br />Nowhere is that more prevalent than in the District, which has more than one plate-reader per square mile, the highest concentration in the nation. Police in the Washington suburbs have dozens of them as well, and local agencies plan to add many more in coming months, creating a comprehensive dragnet that will include all the approaches into the District.<br /><br />“It never stops,” said Capt. Kevin Reardon, who runs Arlington County’s plate reader program. “It just gobbles up tag information. One of the big questions is, what do we do with the information?”<br /><br />Police departments are grappling with how long to store the information and how to balance privacy concerns against the value the data provide to investigators. The data are kept for three years in the District, two years in Alexandria, a year in Prince George’s County and a Maryland state database, and about a month in many other suburban areas.<br /><br />“That’s quite a large database of innocent people’s comings and goings,” said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union’s technology and liberty program. “The government has no business collecting that kind of information on people without a warrant.”<br /><br />But police say the tag readers can give them a critical jump on a child abductor, information about when a vehicle left — or entered — a crime scene, and the ability to quickly identify a suspected terrorist’s vehicle as it speeds down the highway, perhaps to an intended target.<br /><br />Having the technology during the Washington area sniper shootings in 2002 might have stopped the attacks sooner, detectives said, because police could have checked whether any particular car was showing up at each of the shooting sites.<br /><br />“It’s a perfect example of how they’d be useful,” said Lt. T.J. Rogers, who is responsible for the 26 tag readers maintained by the Fairfax County police. “We see a lot of potential in it.”<br /><br />The plate readers are different from red-light or speed cameras, which issue traffic tickets and are tools for deterrence and enforcement. The readers are an investigative tool, capturing a picture of every license plate that passes by and instantly analyzing them against a database filled with cars wanted by police.<br /><br />Police can also plug any license plate number into the database and, as long as it passed a camera, determine where that vehicle has been and when. Detectives also can enter a be-on-the-lookout into the database, and the moment that license plate passes a detector, they get an alert.<br /><br />It’s that precision and the growing ubiquity of the technology that has libertarians worried. In Northern Virginia recently, a man reported his wife missing, prompting police to enter her plate number into the system.<br /><br />They got a hit at an apartment complex, and when they got there, officers spotted her car and a note on her windshield that said, in essence, “Don’t tow, I’m visiting apartment 3C.” Officers knocked on the door of that apartment, and she came out of the bedroom. They advised her to call her husband.<br /><br />A new tool in the arsenal<br /><br />Even though they are relatively new, the tag readers, which cost about $20,000 each, are now as widely used as other high-tech tools police employ to prevent and solve crimes, including surveillance cameras, gunshot recognition sensors and mobile finger­print scanners.<br /><br />License plate readers can capture numbers across four lanes of traffic on cars zooming up to 150 mph.<br /><br />“The new technology makes our job a lot easier and the bad guys’ job a lot harder,” said D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier.<br /><br />The technology first was used by the postal service to sort letters. Units consist of two cameras — one that snaps digital photographs and another that uses an optical infrared sensor to decipher the numbers and letters. The camera captures a color image of the vehicle while the sensor “reads” the license plate and transfers the data to a computer.<br /><br />When stored over time, the collected data can be used instantaneously or can help with complex analysis, such as whether a car appears to have been followed by another car or if cars are traveling in a convoy.<br /><br />Police also have begun using them as a tool to prevent crime. By positioning them in nightclub parking lots, for example, police can collect information about who is there. If members of rival gangs appear at a club, police can send patrol cars there to squelch any flare-ups before they turn violent. After a crime, police can gather a list of potential witnesses in seconds.<br /><br />“It’s such a valuable tool, it’s hard not to jump on it and explore all the things it can do for law enforcement,” said Kevin Davis, assistant chief of police in Prince George’s County.<br /><br />The readers have been used across the country for several years, but the program is far more sophisticated in the Washington region. The District has 73 readers; 38 of them sit stationary and the rest are attached to police cars. D.C. officials say every police car will have one some day.<br /><br />The District’s license plate cameras gather more than a million data points a month, and officers make an average of an arrest a day directly from the plate readers, said Tom Wilkins, executive director of the D.C. police department’s intelligence fusion division, which oversees the plate reader program. Between June and September, police found 51 stolen cars using the technology.<br /><br />Police do not publicly disclose the locations of the readers. And while D.C. law requires that the footage on crime surveillance cameras be deleted after 10 days unless there’s an investigative reason to keep it, there are no laws governing how or when Washington area police can use the tag reader technology. The only rule is that it be used for law enforcement purposes.<br /><br />“That’s typical with any emerging technology,” Wilkins said. “Even though it’s a tool we’ve had for five years, as it becomes more apparent and widely used and more relied upon, people will begin to scrutinize it.”<br /><br />Legal concerns<br /><br />Such scrutiny is happening now at the U.S. Supreme Court with a related technology: GPS surveillance. At issue is whether police can track an individual vehicle with an attached GPS device.<br /><br />Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University who has been closely watching the Supreme Court case, said the license plate technology probably would pass constitutional muster because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy on public streets.<br /><br />But, Kerr said, the technology’s silent expansion has allowed the government to know things it couldn’t possibly know before and that the use of such massive amounts of data needs safeguards.<br /><br />“It’s big brother, and the question is, is it big brother we want, or big brother that we don’t want?” Kerr said. “This technology could be used for good and it could be used for bad. I think we need a conversation about whether and how this technology is used. Who gets the information and when? How long before the information is deleted? All those questions need scrutiny.”<br /><br />Should someone access the database for something other than a criminal investigation, they could track people doing legal but private things. Having a comprehensive database could mean government access to information about who attended a political event, visited a medical clinic, or went to Alcoholics Anonymous or Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />Maryland and Virginia police departments are expanding their tag reader programs and by the end of the year expect to have every major entry and exit point to the District covered.<br /><br />“We’re putting fixed sites up in the capital area,” said Sgt. Julio Valcarcel, who runs the Maryland State Police’s program, which now has 19 mobile units and one fixed unit along a major highway, capturing roughly 27 million reads per year. “Several sites are going online over the winter.”<br /><br />Some jurisdictions store the information in a large networked database; others retain it only in the memory of each individual reader’s computer, then delete it after several weeks as new data overwrite it.<br /><br />A George Mason University study last year found that 37 percent of large police agencies in the United States now use license plate reader technology and that a significant number of other agencies planned to have it by the end of 2011. But the survey found that fewer than 30 percent of the agencies using the tool had researched any legal implications.<br /><br />There also has been scant legal precedent. In Takoma Park, police have two tag readers that they have been using for two years. Police Chief Ronald A. Ricucci said he was amazed at how quickly the units could find stolen cars. When his department first got them, he looked around at other departments to see what kind of rules and regulations they had.<br /><br />“There wasn’t much,” Ricucci said. “A lot of people were using them and didn’t have policies on them yet.”<br /><br />Finding stolen cars faster<br /><br />The technology first came to the Washington region in 2004 as a pilot program. During an early test, members of the Washington Area Vehicle Enforcement Unit recovered eight cars, found 12 stolen license plates and made three arrests in a single shift. Prince George’s police bought several units to help combat the county’s crippling car theft and carjacking problem. It worked.<br /><br />“We recover cars very quickly now. In previous times that was not the case,” said Prince George’s Capt. Edward Davey, who is in charge of the county’s program. “Before, they’d be dumped on the side of the road somewhere for a while.”<br /><br />Now Prince George’s has 45 units and is likely to get more soon.<br /><br />“The more we use them, the more we realize there’s a whole lot more on the investigative end of them,” Davey said. “We are starting to evolve. Investigators are starting to realize how to use them.”<br /><br />Arlington police cars equipped with the readers regularly drive through the parking garage at the Pentagon City mall looking for stolen cars, checking hundreds of them in a matter of minutes as they cruise up and down the aisles. In Prince William County, where there are 12 mobile readers, the units have been used to locate missing people and recover stolen cars.<br /><br />Unlike in the District, in most suburban jurisdictions, the units are only attached to police cars on patrol, and there aren’t enough of them to create a comprehensive net.<br /><br />Virginia State Police have 42 units for the entire state, most of them focused on Northern Virginia, Richmond and the Tidewater area, and as of now have no fixed locations. There is also no central database, so each unit collects information on its own and compares it against a daily download of wanted vehicles from the FBI and the state.<br /><br />But the state police are looking into fixed locations that could capture as many as 100 times more vehicles, 24 hours a day, with the potential to blanket the interstates.<br /><br />“Now, we’re not getting everything — we’re fishing,” said Sgt. Robert Alessi, a 23-year veteran who runs the state police’s program. “Fixed cameras will help us use a net instead of one fishing pole with one line in the water waiting to get a nibble.”<br /><br />Beyond the technology’s ability to track suspects and non-criminals alike, it has expanded beyond police work. Tax collectors in Arlington bought their own units and use the readers to help collect money owed to the county. Chesterfield County, in Virginia, uses a reader it purchased to collect millions of dollars in delinquent car taxes each year, comparing the cars on the road against the tax rolls.<br /><br />Police across the region say that they are careful with the information and that they are entrusted with many pieces of sensitive information about citizens, including arrest records and Social Security numbers.<br /><br />“If you’re not doing anything wrong, you’re not driving a stolen car, you’re not committing a crime,” Alessi said, “then you don’t have anything to worry about.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

				I dont vend so I haven&#039;t given vending security much thought, but I would think counter surveillance would be your number one defense against the enemy.&nbsp; However that would require people in real life knowing about your operation.&nbsp; If you had two guys that could do counter surveillance for 1 hour or 2 before the drop with sophisticated equipment I think that could greatly lessen the chance of you getting fingered.&nbsp; I know most venders like to use business labels but if mailing a letter why not send a few from other peoples mail boxes people your sure are not home during the day throw a letter or two in and put up the flag.&nbsp; There has to be a shit load of ways to beat the system,&nbsp; also move around from town to town.&nbsp; I mean how much money would it cost to watch every post box in 5 towns/cities its just not feasible.

Ever since the whole anthrax debacle the PO began implementing&nbsp; a new procedure. Basically, every package from a specific box is collected and placed into the same box(or crate or whatever you want to call it). The boxes containing that mail is then scanned and cataloged and every piece of mail in that bundle is now linked to that drop box it was placed in. I don&#039;t think it is really that far of a stretch to think that the USPS is perfectly capable of implementing such a system without much of an increase in work-load. Something turns up fishy at the sorting facility, they are able to determine which drop box it came from.. Now, if it is discovered at the locations sort facillity I am sure its probably a different situation. Nut rest assured that YOUR post office is able to tell you which mailbox each parcel they are sorting has come from.<br /><br />if I get the gumption to do it I will try to find the OP that I followed the link from when I learned about this.

				I can agree with part of what you say QTC as I am well aware of those operations... but there is a BIG difference between those operations and SR...<br /><br />in those cases the Feds were selling drugs to biker gangs in VERY controlled ways. They knew who was getting the drugs and where the drugs were at all times.. and the majority of those raids happened shortly after the drugs were delivered so that LE wouldn&#039;t lose custody of the drugs... in this case we are talking about LE selling drugs to unknown people all over the country, completely giving up custody of said drugs with ZERO way of knowing who those drugs would end up in the hands of....&nbsp; <br /><br />regardless of the conspiracy theories involving the DEA and all the clandestine things they do (teaching the black community to make crack...?) there is no way LE would or could actively sell drugs on Silk Road.

				You&#039;re right feds selling drugs online isn&#039;t something I&#039;ve heard of being done yet. I&#039;m just saying that we shouldn&#039;t put it past them especially when their starting up dzf effectively facilitated the distribution of drugs the exact same way sr does, which is parasitic trafficking from unknown vendors to unknown customers.

Entrapment refers to the government putting you in a scenario where you would/do commit a crime that you would NOT have done on your own. Perhaps they made you feel socially, economically, or mentally &quot;trapped&quot; and then you did it (help to remember what entrapment is).<br /><br />If a fake-hooker cop asks you for money for sex, and you repeatedly say no, but you finally agree after she tells you she needs money to pay for her dying grandmother&#039;s hospital bills, you may have a case for entrapment (but even that is a bit grey). <br /><br />But on Silk Road?<br /><br />Almost by definition, coming to the &#039;Road means you&#039;re looking to purchase drugs, and when you click &quot;add to cart&quot; and exchange your money with your vendor, it&#039;s pretty clear what your intent is. They didn&#039;t trick or force you into it, they just provided the opportunity.<br /><br />I do think there is LE (or those employed in some way by LE) selling stuff on here. I&#039;m fairly certain. I mean, if Officer Brown pockets some heroin in a raid, or is accepting it as a bribe to stay quiet, he&#039;s gonna either use or sell it. This place is perfect for stuff like that- what if he sells it IRL and the person rats him out? Potentially messy.<br /><br />So Officer Brown won&#039;t be a big seller here, just a part-timer. Fine. What about the big guys? I wouldn&#039;t bet my life on it, but I think all the big vendors are just that: vendors, looking to run a successful business. While I admit the possibility that there could be some conspiracy where crooked cops who raid (or accept bribes in the form of drugs, or whatever) sell to the vendors, who resell it online, I think the odds aren&#039;t that great. They would need to be able to obtain a huge (and steady) supply, and doing their own work is a job in its own.<br /><br />So yes, I think LE is at least partially responsible for the drugs we buy here. But the idea we&#039;re buying from some giant covert DEA/FBI/whatever organization whose sole purpose is to record addys of users, send controlled shipments, and get arrests? That particular idea is stupid. And demands far more work than a million other ways to catch you or me in real life. <br /><br />That&#039;s not to say giving your address to a vendor is ever safe, though. If I were an immoral vendor, I would keep a full list of buyers. May be worth a year or two off my prison sentence should I ever get caught, especially if anyone&#039;s buying bulk (potentially for their own resale).

This is about money - pure and simple. A lot of people on here seem to base their knowledge about cops on TV shows and movies, where cops actually have some integrity.<br /><br />The truth is that cops are just people, and they&#039;re inherently dumber, more immature, and more malicious than people who work in the private sector (drug dealers included). Google &quot;cops caught stealing drugs&quot; and pick out of thousands of news stories about cops getting CAUGHT stealing drugs of all kinds for all reasons. AND THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT. <br /><br />Now they have a way to easily profit off all those drugs just sitting in the evidence room. At the same time, they can keep their eyes on whoever is making big buys. Do they care about you buying a hit of acid or a quarter of weed? Of course not, they don&#039;t IRL either. But if you make big purchases, odds are you do some big business IRL too and then they&#039;re going to rob you IRL too and call it a bust. Then probably sell your shit on here.<br /><br />There are only two possibilities for why anyone on here would call that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;<br /><br />1. You&#039;re either INCREDIBLY stupid and naive and maybe still a teenager.<br /><br />2. You&#039;re one of the cops themselves and you&#039;re trying to shout this kind of info down. <br /><br />I think its pretty obvious which category &#039;TrustusJones&#039; falls into.<br /><br />Real criminals know that there are only two ways to be: paranoid or busted, and wouldn&#039;t go around calling people &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for calling out cops for what they do.

				That method of attack by LE would only fuel the SR economy. They&#039;d be making each purchase (aka paying the vendor) on a slight chance of progress. They have very little to go on as is so it seems like a grave misapplication of resources. That money may then be used by the receiving vendors to purchase from others or if cashed out, to re-stock. I would imagine that it would take several purchases to even pretend to have solid information about a vendor, each purchase ultimately benefiting the SR community.

				i have a feeling that the DEA are slowly watching, and trying to build a case on us. they wouldnt waste that much government money to go after specific sellers. its DPR they want, and the people who make this site run. i bet what they are finding is that is increasingly difficult to make a case in this, or bust anybody. it could take a very long time to take our community down, or it could happen very soon. my bet is that it will take about a year to make anything happen about it, whether its changing internet legislation, or working with tor to track people, i dont know. its all speculation. but i dont think they will make a move until they can take the whole operation down. thats what they do. all i know is that im stocking up on all of the drugs that i wont be able to get on here. i have a pretty nice collection right now of 200 various high dosed ecstasy pills, 10gs of ketamine, and 3gs of top quality heroin. im spending every dime that i make from work, and from selling my prescription of suboxone to stock up on the good stuff :)

How could they set up surveillance? Within 30 miles of me I have over 100 post offices, 1000&#039;s of blue boxes, 1000&#039;s of Non-post office mail/shipping stores, and well over 1,000,000 residential mailboxes. It could be put in any one of them. Just because a package goes out via a given post code (or zip code) does not mean the next shipment will come from the same post/zip code. For me shipping locations are chosen at random and only used once. The idea that they could place surveillance around all of them is nuts.<br /><br />This sounds about as well thought out as Project Gun Runner. Where the US government was approving gun sales to known Mexican mafia gun buyers. So they can trace the flow of guns. There were no traces, no way to track the guns, no registration of the serial numbers, and no telling where they went.<br /><br />
