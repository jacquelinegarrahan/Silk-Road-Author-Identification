				So I started using SR about a month ago. Recently I have been debating on what should be done on a mac/apple to prevent any &quot;further investigation into the unit&quot;. <br /><br />Now of course I use the TorBrowser and GPGTools, but what other pre-cautions should I take? What are the thoughts from you guys? I have heard of using a portable drive with linux and Silk Road, is this possible on mac?<br /><br />I also use a load of torrent trackers. So in that case would just a torrent file be enough to send me to court? If they were to see that my computer had the TorBundle could they send me for further hearing, or could they do nothing unless the account was signed on? <br /><br />Here&#039;s a little question that doesn&#039;t have to be answered but I would love to know. How much damage must someone do to a computer&#039;s hardrive for it to be corrupted? By corrupted I mean not even the data recovery services like Glyph offer could recover any files?

				Have you turned on FileVault2? As long as your mac is shutdown with FV2 enabled then your data should be safe. I would not suggest saving your password/recovery key with Apple though (it is an option). If you want to &#039;erase&#039; a hard drive to never be read again then simply encrypt it with a random and long password, and then forget the password. You can then install a new version of OSX and be confident that all your old data will never be touched. Beyond this I would say you need to physically destroy the hard drive.<br /><br />Do not leave your mac running when you are not with it. It is possible for .gov to raid you and grab your password out of the ram if it is powered on when they get to it, even with the hard drive encrypted.<br /><br />The latest version of Liberte will boot off a mac when installed on a usb. Tails and Liberte can both be booted on a mac via a cd.<br /><br />To keep them from identifying your torrent activity you might want to look into a VPN.
