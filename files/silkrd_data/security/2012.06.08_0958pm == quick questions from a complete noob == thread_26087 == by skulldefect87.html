				I&#039;m not too computer savvy, particularly. Especially when it comes to all this encryption stuff, its totally new to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What I want to know is.. Is it totally necessary to run TOR from an encrypted flash drive? also I was reading on here and it said to install libere.. is that for Linux only? Im running windows XP, should i reformat my laptop before i make a purchase on SR? <br /><br />Anywho, Im slowing learning all there is to know about surfing SR totally anonymously and I look forward to being a part of this phenomenon. thank you - d

				Well you&#039;re here, so you&#039;ve obviously made a choice to visit here using some form of TOR system!<br /><br />It&#039;s not totally necessary to do anything. There are degrees of security and you should do what you feel comfortable with.<br /><br />Liberte is a good option and to be honest, very easy. It is a Linux-based operating system but the fact you are on Windows is not important. All you need is a USB stick. Then:<br /><br />1. Download the Liberte ZIP file. <br />2. Unzip it onto your USB stick. <br />3. Go into your USB stick, into the Liberte folder<br />4. Double-click the file &#039;setup.bat&#039;<br /><br />You now have a bootable USB stick. Try shutting down your PC, and starting it up again with the USB stick plugged in. If it boots into Windows XP, you will need to go into your PC&#039;s BIOS and enable an option called &#039;Boot from USB&#039;, or set the &#039;Boot order&#039; so that USB is first. I&#039;ll leave you to Google how to do that.<br /><br />If however it boots into Liberte, it&#039;ll take a little while to do its thing, and you&#039;ll be prompted to choose a password. Once you&#039;re into Liberte, take a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the environment. You&#039;ll find &#039;Midori&#039; in the applications list under &#039;Internet&#039;. That&#039;s your TOR browser which you can use to visit this site.<br /><br />Liberte is a very good option for visiting this site and others like it.

				Liberte is a good option, but can be confusing if you aren&#039;t used to a Linux environment.<br /><br />As long as you are running the Tor browser bundle (the normal download from Tor) then all your internet activity is encrypted and your history gets permanently deleted when you close the browser so you&#039;re very safe anyway.<br /><br />If you wanted to be extra safe, put your Tor browser bundle into a small TrueCrypt folder that you can make very easily using TrueCrypt. It&#039;s not a perfect solution, but much easier than using Liberte. If you do decide to use Liberte, I&#039;m sure there will be lots of people here willing to help you&nbsp; :)

				From one noob to another...<br /><br />Use a USB drive.&nbsp; Download Truecrypt (free) and install a hidden volume, follow the instructions at https://security.ngoinabox.org/en/truecrypt_hiddenvolumes.&nbsp; Use strong passwords and don&#039;t forget them!<br /><br />Install innocuous stuff on the &quot;outer&quot; volume.&nbsp; Put all of your SR stuff (TOR, BitCoin, GPG4Win) on the hidden &quot;inner&quot; volume.&nbsp; Keep the outer/inner volume passwords memorized.&nbsp; Backup your stuff to your hard disk but use an encrypted backup, like 7-Zip using encryption.<br /><br />It&#039;s not hard.&nbsp; Let us know if you have questions.

				Hi Nunya,<br /><br />I actually posted a thread on this earlier today explaining step by step how to encrypt a USB stick and download the TBB to it : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26074.0<br /><br />Let me know what you think!<br /><br />V.<br />
