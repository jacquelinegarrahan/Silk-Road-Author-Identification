				Bitmessage is a decentralized messaging system working like bitcoin but for messaging. It would be really good for the SR community if it became the defacto communication standard for messaging just like TorMail was in the past. It is free and not subject to shutdown like Lavabit. I have a mac dmg installer for anyone interested.<br /><br />www.bitmessage.org (clearnet)<br /><br />Love,<br />-xoxo

				It&#039;s called Messages on the SR site.&nbsp; Why use something third party and external?&nbsp; You are just adding more insecure variables.<br /><br />And anyway, if you&#039;re going to encourage an encrypted messaging standard, it should be based on the OTR protocol to ensure deniability.&nbsp; Verifiable/source-provable encryption technologies can do more harm then good.<br /><br />Also, from the Bitmessage website:<br />&quot;<br />Security audit needed<br />Bitmessage is in need of an independent audit to verify its security. If you are a researcher capable of reviewing the source code, please email the lead developer. You will be helping to create a great privacy option for people everywhere!<br />&quot;<br /><br />So ya... I definitely would not use bitmessage.

				They are open source and the code looks very solid. Requesting an audit does not mean insecurity. It would be a great backup messaging source if SR goes down, and it certainly beats using clearnet email systems, passing pgp encrypted messages through the system would make it very secure. Their whitepaper is quite good on detailing how it functions. <br /><br />But you know? You are right, it is still technically in beta and should only be used as back up and with pgp. <br /><br />xoxo

BitMessage has all kinds of flaws it should be avoided.

				Sorry guys it appears I was premature in suggesting this, I will take the council of more established members. My sincerest apologies, I will lock the topic now. Don&#039;t use it.
