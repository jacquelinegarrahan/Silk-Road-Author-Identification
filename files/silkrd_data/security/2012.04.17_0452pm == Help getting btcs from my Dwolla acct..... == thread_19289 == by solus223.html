				Hi all.&nbsp; Mt. Gox threw me a loop and will not let me send money from my dwolla account until it is 30 days old.&nbsp; Must be a new policy, because I did just that about two weeks ago.&nbsp; The obvious answer is wait another week for the 30 days to be up, but I really need to get some btcs over to my SR wallet today.&nbsp; Any advice on where I can convert my dwolla funds into btcs real quick?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Unless you want to give them your ssn# then you&#039;re out of luck for right now at least. Your best bet is to send the funds back to your bank which takes 3-5 days. <br /><br />If you have the extra funds and you need something quickly you should check out bitinstant and use that to make an easy cash deposit at a bank. I had the exact same problem yesterday but I finally went with bitinstant and it was much easier and I got the money into SR within a couple hours.

				I have already verified with my ssn on dwolla over a week ago.&nbsp; It is just the 30 day wait that is new and not allowing me to send.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any other btc trading sites that I can do something today on?

				In the same boat here... will just have to wait the 30 days since I don&#039;t know of other ways to get btc this easily directly from my US bank without leaving the house.

				I just verified with Dwolla support that no matter what verifications you want to send them, the new rule is that you must have a bank deposit more than 30 days old in order to transfer to currency exchanges (like MtGox). Period.<br />Edited to add: Attempts from several exchanges just kick back to Dwolla, which displays a screen listing the things you have to do to be verified. All can be done but the 30-day delay.

				That&#039;s weird, I made my first deposit into dwolla a week ago, and it allowed me to immediately transfer into my mt.gox account. Anyways, I made my second deposit today using bitinstant==&gt;mt.gox. It is soooo much quicker that using dwolla. I will definitely use this method for now on.

				So it sounds like it is not just a Mt. Gox deal.&nbsp; Any exchange where dwolla is used will require the 30 - day wait.<br /><br />And it is not just an issue of having an account open for 30 days or more.&nbsp; You actually have to have money from your bank account in dwolla for over 30 days.&nbsp; That is the way I understand it.&nbsp; BS if you ask me.&nbsp; It seems like in the age of the internet you still can&#039;t get instant service.

				I attempted using bitinstant to get my funds from Dwolla to Mt. Gox, but it appears that is not working either.&nbsp; I am consulting with a rep from bitcoinexchange.&nbsp; It looks promising, I will let you know.<br /><br />*update*<br />bitcoinexchange a no go.<br /><br />*update*<br />get-bitcoin.com has allowed me to send my dwolla funds to them and they are sending my btc&#039;s right into my SR wallet.&nbsp; it is not an exchange, but a set price on btc&#039;s.&nbsp; they say it will take &#039;up too&#039; 24 hrs., which is still better than fucking with dwolla if time is an issue.

				When did this policy go into effect?&nbsp; I can find nothing about it on Dwolla and I just sent funds to Mt. Gox on the 13th and the 15th.

It&#039;s easy to steal bank accounts and use dwolla to cash out anonymous bitcoins, so MtGox and Bitinstant have security measures placed on their Dwolla accounts you must link a bullshit twitter or facebook account, have it for 30 days and be ID verified to transfer money to them.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t find somebody else on bitcointalk.org who is selling bitcoins for dwolla and send to them, or the plenty of other exchanges who haven&#039;t been flagged yet.
