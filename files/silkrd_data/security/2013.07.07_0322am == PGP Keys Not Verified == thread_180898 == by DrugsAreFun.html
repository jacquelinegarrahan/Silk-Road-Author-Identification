				I know my PGP has been working correctly since I have done several orders and that&#039;s the only way they could have gotten my address&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I do want to know what this warning means though.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to be using the vendor Tessellated as an example only because he did a recent Reddit AMA and verifying his signature sparked my interest.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never actually ordered from him so don&#039;t ask any questions about that heh.<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hjo57/i_am_tessellated_ask_me_anything/<br /><br />I&#039;m using Linux GPG version 2.0.20.&nbsp; When I try to verify his signature it displays the following:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">gpg: Signature made Tue 02 Jul 2013 11:00:56 PM CDT using RSA key ID 497F3262<br />gpg: Good signature from &quot;Tessellated&quot;<br />gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!<br />gpg:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.<br />Primary key fingerprint: DC53 338E AA82 BEB9 41B5&nbsp; 9E26 27EC E978 497F 3262<br /></code><br />It did successfully verify saying &quot;Good signature&quot; (further confirmed by me manually changing a single character in message makes it say &quot;Bad signature&quot;).&nbsp; However, it&#039;s the WARNING about a &quot;trusted signature&quot; that has me a little concerned.<br /><br />Also, whenever I try to encrypt a message with a vendor&#039;s public key (does this every time with every vendor... not just Tessellated) it displays the following:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">gpg: 3CBC4194: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user<br /><br />pub&nbsp; 2048R/3CBC4194 2012-10-10 Tessellated<br />&nbsp;Primary key fingerprint: DC53 338E AA82 BEB9 41B5&nbsp; 9E26 27EC E978 497F 3262<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subkey fingerprint: 33AF 1A2C 63DF 6B32 B7A0&nbsp; CF53 68D5 41BD 3CBC 4194<br /><br />It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named<br />in the user ID.&nbsp; If you *really* know what you are doing,<br />you may answer the next question with yes.<br /><br />Use this key anyway? (y/N)</code><br />And again, obviously it seems to encrypt correctly every time because that&#039;s the only way they could have gotten my address (and I&#039;ve done this across multiple vendors and never received a complaint.)&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering what the deal is here.

				Don&#039;t worry about it too much. Not all users sign their own keys (even tho it&#039;s a good idea - some programs automatically self-sign), and most SR public keys never move beyond being self-signed. Nearly everyone here is pseudonymous, and in general signing a key to verify it means you&#039;re 100% certain that a particular key belongs to the individual whose name is on it (most PGP guides have a high standard for this - f2f confirmation + id documents etc so most SR users won&#039;t have particularly &quot;trusted&quot; keys).<br /><br />(clearnet) phildev.net/pgp/gpgsigning.html<br /><br />Also, part of the trust thing is up to you. GnuGP can verify that a certain key made that signature, but you as a user are the one who needs to decide whether or not the key really belongs to Tessellated (or whomever) and to assign a trust index based on that. It&#039;s not really a widely used feature among SR members, again b/c of to the pseudonymous thing. If you wanted you could sign Tessellated&#039;s key to verify it, which as long as your own key is signed (by you) would remove that first warning. <br /><br />The reason these features exist is because someone could create a key that seemed to be from Tessellated (using his name &amp; email address) and upload that to a public keyserver or use it elsewhere while pretending to be Tessellated. They also could use his unsigned public key to create a key that not only had his name and address but also his KeyID to be even more convincing. If his key is signed, that &quot;fake&quot; key will generate a &quot;BAD SIGNATURE&quot; alert when checked. <br /><br />But as long as you&#039;re reasonably sure that Tessellated&#039;s account hasn&#039;t been hacked and the PGP key on his vending account is one he posted himself you&#039;re fine. :)<br /><br /><br />

				It would be hard to create a web of trust in this community, since we avoid using key servers, so just ignore that warning.<br />

				Actually, the only thing we do have in that&nbsp; regard IS a web of trust.&nbsp; Just that it&#039;s out own, not that anticipated by GPGnu tutorials or what have you from the clearnet.&nbsp; Legit Vendors and Buyers accumulate positive feedback and scammers don&#039;t (in general)..&nbsp; &nbsp;and that imo, is a stronger... or at least as strong of a web of trust - not to mention privacy than one which allows your real personal details to be open to scrutiny by unknown outsider parties...&nbsp; &nbsp;and so yeah, the warning doesn&#039;t even apply here...&nbsp; :)

				So if anyone can kindly help me understand the signature process I would appreciate it. Using tails.<br /><br />For instance to verify DPR&#039;s signature. First I have imported his public key into my key manager. Next I paste his PGP signature into a text (gedit) file and save it. I right click and select &quot;open with verify signature&quot; which opens a file selection window, and at this point I&#039;m lost as it seems regardless of what I select I get a &quot;bad key&quot; message. I&#039;ve tried selecting the signature and the public key both and keep getting the same message.<br /><br />What am I missing here?

That&#039;s pretty clear (took me a minute to figure out) but I understand it.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand and am trying to figure out, is how you verify someone&#039;s PGP signature. So for example, as you mentioned the warning message on SR that directs to a post on the forum by DPR, he has his message then at the bottom he lists his PGP signature. How do you verify that his PGP signature is valid and that it&#039;s actually him (just DPR not the real ID of course) posting the message? I know he does this so anyone looking will be able to verify that PGP signature and confirm that is in fact the actual DPR and not some LE (or hacker I suppose) that compromised his servers and took over his account.<br /><br />Maybe my understanding here is all wrong, and if that is case maybe the basic question I should be asking is, what is the PGP signature used for when someone posts it publicly as he does on most of his posts?<br /><br />Thanks again for your help. This is one of the few things regarding the whole process that I don&#039;t quite understand, and I know it&#039;s really irrelevant in regards to placing orders etc... but like many on here, I want to know when we get a message from DPR stating it&#039;s really him and all is well, that it is in fact DPR, and I can verify this as others do.

I know he does this so anyone looking will be able to verify that PGP signature and confirm that is in fact the actual DPR and not some LE (or hacker I suppose) that compromised his servers and took over his account.<br /><br />Maybe my understanding here is all wrong, and if that is case maybe the basic question I should be asking is, what is the PGP signature used for when someone posts it publicly as he does on most of his posts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are going around verifying the signature the right way, there&#039;s just a weird issue with his latest signed message, if you&#039;re copying it to verify (at least with a webkit-based browser). See the 2 spaces before &quot;Of course&quot;? One is actually a different space character when you copy it out of the browser; delete both spaces and then press space twice to add back normal spaces, and then it should verify, saying &quot;Good signature&quot;.<br /><br />That then proves that the person who wrote the message had access to DPR&#039;s private key. Which is hopefully just DPR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To Boaclon and all the others that helped me out...THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!<br /><br />First without pointing out the issue above of course I would have never figured this out, and it got me started down the path to complete understanding.<br /><br />Of course it was a stupid newb issue that caused it, which was that I was taking the PGP message and attempting to decrypt it at the file level and not the text level, but never the less I understand now and without everyone here&#039;s help I would not have so thanks again!
