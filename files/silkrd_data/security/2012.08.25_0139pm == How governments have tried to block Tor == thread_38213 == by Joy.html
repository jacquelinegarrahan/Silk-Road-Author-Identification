				Green: I more than agree with you, I am definitely not arguing in favor of people who may be &quot;targets&quot; running exit nodes... <br /><br />Although it does also bring up another point: the fact that there are &quot;BAD&quot; exit nodes that are filtering, sifting and scooping your data as it goes through.

I don&#039;t think TOR is still receiving funding from them because one of the lead developers hinted that donations would make them work on bigger project and improve current project (tails, tor, etc). I donate whenever I have spare coins, we should get a sticky going so everyone can donate to the TOR developers. I keep trying to read about TOR but it&#039;s just way too complicated, I wish someone (maybe you pine?) could translate it into layman&#039;s terms about the innerworkings of TOR because as of now all I know is it&#039;s a huge network shared by people that connect to TOR and the more people that connect to TOR the more anonymous we become. I still don&#039;t understand how they can track you through exit nodes, that&#039;s the only part I&#039;m confused/scared about. When the FBI caught the ring of pedophiles even though they were using TOR but finally got them through bad exit nodes, I still don&#039;t understand how that works. I&#039;m assuming it was because they were sending files which we don&#039;t do on SR so I don&#039;t really worry about that.

I&#039;m assuming it was because they were sending files which we don&#039;t do on SR so I don&#039;t really worry about that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First I think the tor developers do not want an organized effort on SR to send them money, that would be bad for their PR. Although if you do want to contribute by running a relay or donating go ahead, I just don&#039;t think Tor wants SR to be seen as sending them funding. Here I will explain how Tor works for you.<br /><br />Tor is a low latency anonymity network. It gives users anonymity by routing their traffic through &#039;telescoping&#039; encrypted tunnels through three nodes. The first node is the entry, the second is the middle and the third is the exit. The entry node knows who you are, but it can not see where you are surfing,&nbsp; the middle node does not know who you are or where you are surfing, and the exit knows where you are surfing but not who you are. The exit node connects to the servers you communicate with. Traffic from the exit node to the destination you communicate with is not encrypted, so it can be intercepted and spied on by the exit node. This could compromise &#039;who you are&#039; if you go to your facebook page for example, but it will not compromise where you are unless you leak that through the exit traffic as well somehow. The destination you communicate with can not trace you because they see the IP address of the exit node you are using, not your own IP address. In the best case scenario they will need to go back one hop at a time an. d get logs until the trail leads them back to you. Hopefully at least one of the three nodes you are using is not keeping logs or being passively monitored, in which case the trails will go dead at the first such node and you will remain anonymous. <br /><br />Tor is not perfect. There are two sorts of attacker involved with traffic analysis, passive and active. Passive attackers monitor the links between nodes, such an attacker could be an ISP that several Tor nodes use, for example. An active attacker is one who adds nodes to the network and is able to view their internal state. Some attackers are combinations of active and passive. The more Tor nodes there are, the more protection you are afforded from an active attacker. After all, if there are ten nodes and an attacker owns one, they can monitor 10% of the network, but if there are 100 nodes and an attacker owns one they are only monitoring 1% of the network. It is important that nobody owns a large percentage of the nodes on the network, because Tor does not prevent traffic confirmation attacks. An attacker who can see packets at two points on the Tor network can use timing correlation attacks to link the packets together. This would be very bad if the attacker doing this sort of attack owned your entry and exit node, because then they could link the packets they see you sending through their entry node to the packets arriving at the destination, thus deanonymizing you with only two out of the three nodes on your circuit. <br /><br />Passive attackers are generally (but not necessarily) more powerful than active attackers. An attacker who owns the ISP used by one hundred Tor nodes is capable of monitoring the traffic into and out of those Tor nodes as well as if they ran the Tor nodes themselves. Again, if a passive attacker can monitor your entry and exit traffic they can use timing correlation attack to link them together and thus deanonymize you. Having more nodes on the network does not inherently protect from such an attacker, however having location diversity in the nodes on the network does protect from this sort of attacker. If the Tor network consisted of nodes all in one data center, the owner of the data center could deanonymize all Tor circuits without owning a single Tor node, regardless of how many nodes were on the network. However, if the nodes are in data centers distributed around the world, it becomes far less likely that the owner of a single data center can deanonymize Tor circuits by themselves. Thankfully there middle nodes as well, so even if your entry and exit are being monitored by different attackers, unless they are already colluding and sharing intelligence with each other they will not be able to identify each other to request collusion in specific cases unless they can get the middle node to cooperate to introduce them to each other. One of the most powerful sorts of attacker is called global passive, and this means that they are able to monitor the links between every node on a network (if they are global in the context of the network, some may argue that a true global passive adversary can monitor all links on the internet, but I find this definition to be irrelevant when a specific sub network is being discussed). Tor is completely incapable of offering any protection from such an attacker, but such attackers are likely very few and far between if any even exist. NSA would likely be the closest attacker to a GPA although some other signals intelligence agencies such as GCHQ may come close as well. Certainly the Swedish signals intelligence agency monitors all traffic in and out of Sweden, that is not GPA but is still a fairly powerful attacker, and it is likely impossible for Swedish people to anonymously access servers in Sweden unless they stay within their own country at entry or exit. <br /><br />Connections to hidden services don&#039;t use exit nodes in the same sense as connections to the clearnet do, but the same general principles apply to them. Hidden services are actually much easier to deanonymize than clients, because clients can force them to open an arbitrary number of new circuits and send them packets + watch for the packets at malicious nodes until they trace up to their entry guards. Three entry guard nodes that make direct contact with a hidden service server can be enumerated in about a minute, and then for a passive capable attacker it is just a matter of monitoring one of them to deanonymize the hidden service. For an active attacker it is a little bit harder, they need to force the hidden service to use one of their entry guards, and the quickest way to do this involves DOSing guard nodes until you get lucky or run out of resources. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The LOGS issue, you may not never know, which means, possibly logging in from an &quot;anonymous&quot; wifi or internet connection.

One of the most powerful sorts of attacker is called global passive, and this means that they are able to monitor the links between every node on a network (if they are global in the context of the network, some may argue that a true global passive adversary can monitor all links on the internet, but I find this definition to be irrelevant when a specific sub network is being discussed). Tor is completely incapable of offering any protection from such an attacker, but such attackers are likely very few and far between if any even exist. NSA would likely be the closest attacker to a GPA although some other signals intelligence agencies such as GCHQ may come close as well. Certainly the Swedish signals intelligence agency monitors all traffic in and out of Sweden, that is not GPA but is still a fairly powerful attacker, and it is likely impossible for Swedish people to anonymously access servers in Sweden unless they stay within their own country at entry or exit. <br /><br />Connections to hidden services don&#039;t use exit nodes in the same sense as connections to the clearnet do, but the same general principles apply to them. Hidden services are actually much easier to deanonymize than clients, because clients can force them to open an arbitrary number of new circuits and send them packets + watch for the packets at malicious nodes until they trace up to their entry guards. Three entry guard nodes that make direct contact with a hidden service server can be enumerated in about a minute, and then for a passive capable attacker it is just a matter of monitoring one of them to deanonymize the hidden service. For an active attacker it is a little bit harder, they need to force the hidden service to use one of their entry guards, and the quickest way to do this involves DOSing guard nodes until you get lucky or run out of resources.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 Simple enough to understand, I didn&#039;t even know about active/passive attackers. So would you say it would be wise to use a VPN &gt; TOR? I&#039;ve been researching this question forever and I get mixed answers. I&#039;m thinking a VPN &gt; TOR would be beneficial only if your VPN does not keep logs and you can pay anonymously or would it only make it easier for someone to deanonymize you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have been considering this for some time. I think it really depends on your VPN, and whether you use obfsproxy and bridge relays as your entry guard nodes.<br /><br />If you wanted to host a hidden service somewhere, I would probably use both a VPN to hide the physical location of the server cluster itself, and from the VPN&#039;s IP address set, connect to a set of private bridge relays trusted friends run on your behalf.<br /><br />It would probably be a good idea to run obfsproxy to obfuscate your traffic so it is not immediately recognizable as tor traffic. From those private bridge relays, hidden service rendezvous traffic would then connect to their own sets of entry guards, and it would be very difficult to deanonymize such a service unless the service itself or one of their administrators seriously failed.

You agent provocateur you! ;)<br /><br />I want to pay far less tax (if you want a number, I think 15-20% flat tax and nothing else would be enough), but what taxes I pay I would prefer to have relatively fine grained control over. e.g. deciding how much of my tax I pay to certain government departments.<br /><br />Some people think this is a screwy idea, but I think it&#039;s far far superior an idea than what we have currently, it would bring accountability to the federal government in a big way.<br /><br />I think of the government as a corporation that offers a service (governance) and if I don&#039;t like what they&#039;re doing, I feel I should be able to give them the finger and obtain the services of their competitors. Unfortunately this today means moving country, a risky proposition. With you personally directing government cash flow, you can be supporting the government departments you think are doing a good job, and be giving less economic leverage to those you think are being unreasonable with their powers e.g. the DEA for example. <br /><br />You want want millions of people being harnessed for smoking weed, or a couple of new rocket ships? Stop persecuting the pyschonauts and send up more astronauts.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a crazy idea, it just hasn&#039;t been tried before now. The USA has voluntary entrance to the Army, yet we have the most highly effective Army in the planet. We&#039;re not suddenly going to not have an Army to defend us if everybody votes with their tax dollars, people are not stupid. Occasionally yes, but not over periods of time, there is a sort of efficient market thing going on with people&#039;s opinions, they&#039;re only intractable in the short term. The problem is judging the timing of when you get to vote in blocks of time. e.g. 1 or 2 months (short lived government initiatives) 1 year (regular departments) 5 years (Army) 10 years or more (intelligence programs, NSA, other long term projects etc). <br /><br />We need a way to dynamically change the resolution (using time periods) of when decisions are made about government resources, so that there is no normatives, no fixed time periods for anything. I mean, other than simplicity, why is it the case that 1 president gets control in 4 year blocks? The way we control our government resembles a child&#039;s drawing on a fridge in comparison to the artistry of the fine grained touch of the markets. A market can punch like a giant and touch like a feather by using a price system, seems to me there&#039;s something to learn there, no matter how left-on a socialist somebody might be.<br /><br />Most importantly, people would become much more excited about decision making that affect their lives if they have some control over the process. Bluntly, I think modern day democracy is doing a fucking terrible job at representing our interests, but I don&#039;t believe in giving over my money/rights/power to some small group of people to make all the decisions either (technocrats, dictators, congresspersons...).<br /><br />I mean, you guys know as well as I do, that congressmen and congresswomen barely read the propositions they pass laws on. Indivdually most of them are smart people, but as a collective they might as well be a Alzheimer&#039;s patient.<br /><br />Basically, the USA is a Republic, and while that&#039;s an improvement on direct democracy in terms of reaction time, the concept of &quot;Republic&quot; has had its day. We need a different abstraction now. The Chinese rightly laugh at us compelling them to become a democracy when technically we don&#039;t have one either, our system is closer to theirs than a direct democracy, I don&#039;t think Americans have been paying too much attention in Civics class. China actually does have a democracy. People vote there alright, but you have to be part of the Communist Party to make it mean anything. What they actually lack is a genuine Republic. That&#039;s not quite the same thing is it?<br /><br />I think this is a place where Left wingers and Right wingers can amicably meet each other in the middle, agree to disagree on some things, and make some real progress.<br /><br />The main problem is the apathy you see today. People have lost faith, big time, in government. Then they see potholes in the roads while whompingly large sums of money are wasted on stupid things like 1 trillion dollars down the drain on the Air force&#039;s new fighter jets, which still don&#039;t really exist yet and have just 1 or 2&nbsp; air to air missiles per craft, and they become more apathetic, which is understandable, but it&#039;s not going to change until they fight back and change shit.<br /><br />I do think things will change in the early 21st century, but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s going to involve votes or bullets to be honest, I think we may be overdue a genuine revolution, pitchforks and all.

We aren&#039;t saying it is done, only that it can be done. Without actual detective work, this could become, ah, expensive.<br /><br />There are two issues.<br /><br />1. Tor traffic uses TCP and looks a bit like SSL traffic, but the size of the packets (actually cells in Tor terminology I think) is not consistent with SSL packets, so it is possible detect traffic heading to the Tor network. You can avoid DPI (deep packet inspection) techniques to find Tor users by using Obfsproxy.<br /><br />DPI is used by surveillance states to spy on their civilians. Think of it as a preemptive search warrant. It should illegal, but the public haven&#039;t a clue what&#039;s really going on. They don&#039;t realize it&#039;s the equivalent of the state knowing the exact contents of all their snail mail (but without opening it). Worse yet, they intend to store this information for years with the insane data retention programs they are currently devising. It makes the Stazi look like innocent doe eyed kindergarden pupils. The consequences of this are unbelievable. One day people will rue the day they didn&#039;t understand this was going on, but I shall not be one of those people. The concept of Anonymity vs Identity is going to become a very political issue in the mainstream, I think that is an understatement if anything.<br /><br />2. The entry node (entry guards) are not secret information. (These are the computers you connect to in order to enter the Tor network) So if your ISP sees you connecting to them, it knows you&#039;re using Tor. This can be avoided by the use of bridges. Read the Tor documentation in &#039;Help&#039; for setting up a Tor public bridge, it is trivial to do (go to https://bridges.torproject.org, copy paste the bridges into &quot;Settings -&gt; Tick my ISP prevents me using Tor and enter into the box that appears&quot;). Ideally you should use private bridges, but that&#039;s another story. You should be using ~3 bridges with SSL (denoted by IP address with port 443 such as 123.123.123:443) but not dozens or hundreds of them (or you&#039;ll eventually wind up on a bridge run by the adversary). Ideally you want just 1 permanently on bridge, what is called a persistent entry guard, which is where private bridges come in.<br /><br />1. If the enemy knows you are connecting to the Tor network, it knows who you are but not what you are doing.<br /><br />2. If the enemy then uses a timing or statistical attack on exit node traffic, it then knows what you are doing.<br /><br />Together, both elements blow your anonymity sky high.<br /><br />This does not however, apply to the hidden services in onionland because using these services does not involve the use of exit nodes (or DNS since you&#039;re not on the web, which means the web could be DNS blocked (unless you have memorized the IP addresses for all the sites you visit) and Tor would still work, cool huh?).<br /><br />Better yet, do all the above (private obfsproxy bridges), and run Tor which connects to those private obfsproxy bridges remotely at the other side of the globe. Then aircrack some wifi networks in order to connect to that remote machine. That would be a helluva step by step tutorial. Anybody up for it? ;)<br /><br />--<br /><br />kmfkewm/shannon and others, can you check the above to doublecheck what I&#039;m saying is basically correct about the Tor network and the semantics are appropriate? I do not wish to be passing on misleading/inaccurate information accidentally, thanks.<br /><br />impatiens; if there is anything unclear, ask questions, this is after all an agora.<br /><br />If anybody wants lots more information there is a website par excellence:<br /><br />http://en.flossmanuals.net/bypassing-censorship/<br /><br />Read all of it! Lulz. But seriously, it&#039;s a fine site and more people should read it.

				Mostly correct or at least correct enough. Tor traffic is not consistent with normal internet traffic but it isn&#039;t inconsistent with SSL considering it uses SSL ;). That is just semantics though. DPI is pretty much the state knowing the contents of snail mail by opening it up and looking in it, but the spirit of what you said is correct. You should probably use at least two bridges but not more than three. Attackers don&#039;t need to do timing attacks at the exit node to see what you are doing, they need to do timing attacks at the entry and exit to correlate the traffic and link you to your destination though. Technically connections to hidden services are just as vulnerable to timing attacks as websites on the clearnet are, although it might be slightly more difficult for an attacker to know they are watching the entry node of a hidden service. If you run a Tor node and want to see if you are the entry guard for a given hidden service it is really easy, you can just send the hidden service a stream of packets with some pattern of modulation down a few dozen circuits and then see if you detect any streams with the same modulation passing through your relay and to a non Tor node IP address. Likewise it is easy for a passive attacker to determine if a node they are monitoring is the entry guard for a given hidden service, in the same exact way. It is also easy to trace hidden services up to their entry guards with that active attack from 06, although there are ways to greatly slow down that attack. In fact your DNS servers could go down and you can still access clearnet websites with Tor since it identifies relays by IP address only and uses the same DNS servers as the exit node on your circuit.

				well your entry nodes will always be three of the same set of nodes and only change once every month to two months, the middle and final node should change more frequently though especially to a hidden service. Although the high bandwidth Tor nodes are of course selected more often than others, so it is not uncommon for circuits to frequently use familiar looking nodes.
