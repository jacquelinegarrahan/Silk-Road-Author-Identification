				Hi guys, I made an order with a guy recently and he messaged me to say that he had it bagged up and ready to go. A few weeks later however I learn that he was busted and that the Canadians have some special drug taskforce combing through his house and computer because they realised he was using silk road to distribute. The package never came so if he was telling the truth (about bagging it) I&#039;m guessing the police have a reason to be interested in me.<br /><br />My question is, assuming worse case scenario they found my name and have alerted my country&#039;s authorities and they have decided to investigate, what options do they have to surveil my computer? Not just legal recourse either, let&#039;s assume I have no right to privacy, which is about right anyway. I just want to know what they can do, not necessarily what they will do.<br /><br />I have a mac if relevant and I check and clean it regularly, as well as browsing the net safely. Another thing I was wondering was if police had the ability to trace my prepaid usb internet?<br /><br />I&#039;m just a noob trying to be cautious any tips for safe travels down the road greatly appreciated.

				Not being funny, but maybe if you added your name and the actual product you ordered in your next post, you&#039;ve pretty much made your case for them (LE) - I&#039;m sure LE will be delighted! It&#039;s difficult not to panic n these situations, but think calmly and weigh up your options as though it&#039;s a game of chess (not that I play chess- but you get my meaning?)

				Well Id like to know who the dealer was, Dealers don&#039;t normally message me to let me know they have addressed the package. I would probably stop using that address but having a package in Canada addressed to you seized would not worry me to much.&nbsp; If it was something they wanted to spend time on the would just released the package and track it to your door but then they wouldn&#039;t have the evidence in canada

				Depends on a lot of things. What kind of drug was it. maybe crack is looked at worse then weed. the resources of your country and willingness to charge you. who know maybe your ex. girlfriend set you up. <br /><br />another thing is to have truekrypt there you can have a hidden file and a fake file. if they come and force you to give the password you have your fake one ready. i bet they are just working on his case for now.

				The drug was DMT. Not sure what the effects will be, but to be safe you might not want drugs ordered to that same address any more.

				I would probably wipe hard drive clean and remove drugs from your place for a while.&nbsp; Don&#039;t order anything to the same address anymore.

				Thanks for the info guys, much appreciated. The product was dmt as previously mentioned, only a personal amount so I&#039;m not worried about LE coming after me, but once this happened it just made me realise that now I could be on a gov watchlist somehwhere. So I am just curious as to what LE could do if they had the motivation, I know tor is supposed to be very secure/anonymous, but is that anonymity at risk now they have my name/address? <br /><br />As a computer noob I guess I just worry that they may be able to watch my computer activities in real time, or that maybe they can now go to my internet provider and request my history, but I&#039;m not even sure the internet provider can track/see what pages I&#039;m viewing if I&#039;m using tor?

				Vendor was trojan98, selling mainly dmt stuff. There is a thread about it in the rumor mill. Apparently he made a few big errors, like almost copy and pasting his vendor page to his facebook page. But I think he was undone by neighbours who noticed him dealing out of his house. He was a popular guy here too, if I was him I would not have been selling locally, risking your sr business potential for a little extra local coin. SR anonymity too valuable for vendors to risk I would think..

				Some little tips:<br />- Upgrade your mac to 10.7 (Lion) or 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and activate FileVault with strong password<br />- Instead google use http://duckduckgo.com/<br />- don&#039;t use Safari<br /><br />
