				I was just thinking that it would probably be a good idea to have a highly secure method of physically storing objects that you might not want LE getting to.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how viable it is, but does anyone have any ideas/experience?<br />I was thinking I don&#039;t think it could be inside your house, as LE with a search warrant searching your house could get into most lockboxes etc seeing as they have enough time/resources, and hiding something like that could get expensive/unreliable.<br />However perhaps some sort of PO box or safety deposit box, established with a fake ID?<br />I have little experience in this matter, so if someone with more experience could chime in, that&#039;d be great!<br />

				it depends on the state/country you live in, but where I live they need a separate warrant to search the outside and yard of your house. this also means they need a separate warrant if they want to search your shed etc

Its really something to use for big things. I actually own a wooden contraption that can conceal stuff perfectly with a manual lock. The contraption has different strengths/numbers of locks depending on the price. I`m planning to put them up once I get my bitcoins funded to open a vendor`s account. If you`ll be around they`ll be up soon. Its really amazing, I`m sure the guys on SR will love it.
