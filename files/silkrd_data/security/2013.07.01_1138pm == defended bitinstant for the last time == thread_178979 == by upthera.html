				I have always been surprised how often right after a perfect BI transaction I would see a thread here saying it didn&#039;t work or they had been waiting days. I would always jump in to defend them. Well other than issues with a rude MG person on the phone the other day for the first time and today found out and had it confirmed by support that they had suspended all guest accounts.&nbsp; Now you have to give them your first born or something, I didn&#039;t ask.&nbsp; They&#039;re $86.20 right now!! and i need them and would be just as mad if they were $200, I just want to order and only have a few hundred quid in my account.<br />Bummer, I always assumed people were doing somethign wrong because it always workdd so well for me. <br /><br />** and because it worked so well for my needs I didn&#039;t explore other options and although I know what I&#039;m doing for the most part, I relied on one source now I have no idea who to trust and what advice is good, before someone mentions it local didn&#039;t even have my state listed, and I don&#039;t want to register for anything, I just want to trade cash for the commodity know as BTC that scares the US GOV&#039;t so much. I have friends in Japan and EU, is it easier there? <br />They don&#039;t have to bring down SR, just limit btc enough, and they are winning that way with the quickness.&nbsp; Look at the events of the past two months concerning access to btc. It is a very effective way to strangle SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;Really bummin&nbsp; and frustrated at the moment.<br />just ranting

				I wanted to add a poll but I think just seeing if people will post what they use and the basic procedure if it has not been posted.&nbsp; Need valid ID or not?&nbsp; If Bank wire transfrer do you need an account, do you have to register, even with BS info, What about MG MP and BOA services listed on here for a fee.&nbsp;

				In the past, I&#039;ve used BitCoin services connected directly to my bank account. They&#039;re great as a fail-safe, but they take days to set up (with a 24-48hr turn-around there after). No help there...<br /><br />Did you check the online purchasing options on LocalBitCoins? Look for sellers using &quot;Other Online Payment&quot;, and look directly at each offer. You may find a seller that uses an online payment method that&#039;s more to your liking.

				Tried localcoins for the first time today after my BitInstant fiasco. Found a seller with a decent price, went to BoA and made my deposit, came home and confirmed, and got my coins released about 60 seconds after I confirmed. Localcoins has a new permanent user.

				with these BOA options like the one you mentioned and some btc sellers on the road offer btc through MG/MP or BOA?&nbsp; <br />Do I need an account with BOA or can anyone walk in and wire money.&nbsp; When you do this are you risking buying &quot;dirty coins&quot;, or something? I mean like somebody selling you coin straight from his SR account or something.&nbsp; That recent article about the kid having BTC taken by the &quot;feds?&quot;. That case seemed like a traditional forfiture scam BS but they did have some technical detail on the btc, which was a small amount to have drawn enough attention for them to be analyzinig it and looking at the taint, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m not at all familiar with the technical details of bitcoin, litecoin, or mining<br /><br />boy that was a lot for, &quot;do I need an account&quot;?&nbsp; just smoked a combo of emerald&#039;s afghani and his Pakistani Culero :)

				localbitcoins is really the way of the future right now.. it&#039;s easier to navigate and understand than bitcoin-OTC and is way cheaper and more convenient than just about any other option i know, minus Blue Sky Traders but it seems like their onion site is down..&nbsp; i know they also operate through &quot;CLEARNET BRO&quot; jdpowell.net&nbsp; &nbsp; so maybe try that site??&nbsp; they were supposed to be rolling out their entire new system on monday, then they moved it to tuesday, and now the site&#039;s gone..&nbsp; who knows man???&nbsp; i&#039;m sure it&#039;ll pop back up sooner or later..

				I&#039;m sold on localbitcoins. Used it twice today to pick up 10 BTC&#039;s in no time flat. Lot less of a hassle than Bitinstant. As for BST, they ought to just sell on local and call it a day. You can put your add up and sell your stock and go about your business when it&#039;s gone. I guess they are just in the business of making fees, but they could just as easily mark up their coin on local and make the same money.
