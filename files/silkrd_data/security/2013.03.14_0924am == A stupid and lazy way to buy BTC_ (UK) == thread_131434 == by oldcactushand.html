				I&#039;ve made this thread because a lot of the advice on purchasing bitcoin in the UK goes way over my head. So far, I have purchased bitcoin by meeting someone face to face and giving them cash, but it would be nice if I could do it without leaving my house. So...<br /><br />Is it stupid and lazy if I have a friend (non-SR user) purchase BTC non-anonymously and then send them to my anonymous wallet? Would it be necessary to put them through some sort of tumbler like bitcoinfog or something, before my friend sends them? Would it be even more stupid and lazy if the person purchasing the BTC occasionally gets SR packages delivered to their house, even if they do not use SR themselves? Or is the whole idea just lazy and leaving me open to LE bastardry?<br /><br />On a side note. I see on the &#039;Guide to buying BTC in the UK&#039; thread ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46692.0 ) that people use blockchain.info and pay via bank transfer from their own account? I&#039;m guessing this is safe, because the person who made that thread knows a fuckton more than me about all of this... But how does this NOT compromise anonymity? Is it just because proof of BTC purchase is proof of nothing at all, or what?<br /><br />Sorry if this didn&#039;t need a new thread, I couldn&#039;t find anything with this specific question and wanted a specific answer. I don&#039;t have time to meet someone for bitcoin this week, and there is a certain listing that won&#039;t be there for long that I want to get my hands on. Thanks for the help.

				buying btc are completely legal there is no worry about purchasing bitcoins if anyone asks you heard your friend talking about the profits he made in terms of days and you were intrigued with that and wanted to get involved.&nbsp; And its completely true cause in the last 14 days bitcoin price has increased by a couple dollars...

				Thanks guys. I know it&#039;s legal to buy them. I guess I&#039;m just concerned that it could be used as evidence against me were they to intercept a package/do a controlled delivery etc.<br /><br />I buy small personal amounts, so this is incredibly unlikely. But I don&#039;t want to get too comfortable with this stuff and become lax on security. Is everyone just buying BTC with their own account? There&#039;s no potentially bad consequences of doing this?

				What&#039;s up with #bitcoin-otc-uk? You&#039;re buying from individuals for bank transfer via private message on an IRC server with no logging.

				never be stupid enough to use your own bank account to buy BTC, Sure its not illegal but it is a piece of the puzzle that Le will fine and yo really dont want to be standing there saying, yeah i bought BTC so what? prove i use Sr. because if the fuckers are after you or looking into you, they aren&#039;t just going to let you &quot;win&quot;. <br /><br />either use BTC-OTC like awhiteknight said, or use a site like localbitcoins, Find a user either way, Walk into the bank with a slip of paper with the account no and sort code. Say &quot; I want to transfer X amount into this account. &quot;&nbsp; No questions asked.easy and simple. The hardest part is finding somebody trustworthy. <br /><br />Then transfer it between a few instawallets and easy wallets. on top of that you can use tumblrs if you wish but there is a small fee, SR has a small tumbler built in anyway but it&#039;s better safe and spending half an hour to do this, than spending 5 years for importing class A with intent to supply. <br /><br />Dont leave any paper trails at all if you can. try and keep everything anonymous at all times, It&#039;s your freedom your playng with remember, is it worth the amount your ordering?

				Thanks for the reply man! That&#039;s what I figured, no point risking it. I will continue meeting face to face for now, and hopefully move on to depositing money into an account of someone trustworthy in the near future.

By the time i get home my BTC are in my blockchain, from where i put them into a few instawallets and easywallets , then on top of that for extra security i would use a tumbler if it&#039;s a large order. <br />Simple, dont settle for using your own account, i never fucking would, it doesn&#039;t matter BTC aren&#039;t illegal, if the police see them then they know exactly what you&#039;ve been doing. and they will get a confirmation it&#039;s you because you paid with your own account. if you als start saying &quot;shh you didn&#039;t see me &quot; or any bullshit like that you deserve to get caught. GTFO.<br /><br />Do what you like, but it&#039;s your freedom, and your loss but please dont start spreading the info around the forums, because you will get lots of other people into shit if they take your advice.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />lol I cant work out if your serious or trying to wind me up about me saying you can just walk into a bank and say &#039;shhh just take this money and transfer it to that account, just dont tell any one its for btc&#039;&#039;....clearly I am being sarcastic at the very highest level here!<br /><br />As for my 90% of members statistic well maybe I was a little hasty there but its some where close to that figure, a few will do face to face meets, but the rest are done via some form of bank transfer and as long as your not buying a shit load of product and your not selling I really dont care if LE want to waste their time busting me for&nbsp; buying a bit of weed online in order to avoid buying contaminated rubbish off the streets.<br /><br />I think your heart is in the right place but boy are you over thinking things here.&nbsp; The LE have better things to do and as for wearing some sort of magic mask to go into a bank to avoid coming up on camera wtf are you on about this is taking things to far, your not the worlds most wanted criminal here, your at the very bottom of the list of priorities for the LE and with the way things are going right now with cuts to public services soon LE will literally not have a list for this kind of bust any longer.<br /><br />If I listened to your over the top BS I would be a nervous wreck, dont listen to this joker sr, he will scare you shitless!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok i agree with you 110% about LE not gunna waste time and resources tracking and busting someone for their own personal use of Weed. but it is against the law so if you keep doing it regularly then they aren&#039;t just going to say aww well it&#039;s only personal let&#039;s just let this guy buy his eighth of weed every week. <br /><br />I was at the wind up slightly about the &quot;shh walk into the bank thing&quot; but seriously , Bitcoin local or localbitcoins look for a seller, some have a phone number, they give you the account no. and sort code and you walk into the bank and literally just say i want to put this money into this account. It&#039;s none of their business why you are doing it and i have never been asked. If they did ask, Say your paying a bill, or playing the stock market but they wont. <br /><br />seriously the LED hat, youtube it or google it whatever there is plenty of clearnet info on it, its a hat with a few LED lights that you cant see. Not a fucking james bond gadget, something that might take half an hour to construct, But saves you 10 years inside, yes please. <br />i haven&#039;t used this method but i do walk in with a new era hat and hide my faces from the cameras, therefore there is no record on my bank account of any BTC purchases. I skip that whole part altogether. it is a simple as walking in and depositing the money, Its not like making a large withdrawal and you need ID etc. <br /><br />let me tell you 90% is way off, people care about their freedom. You might not care about if you get busted for your drugs, But i sure as fuck do. You dont know everybody&#039;s personal situations so where you might not care if it affects you, Your bad advice&nbsp; might affect somebodys job, or probation or whatever. always be careful, why would you use your bank account for silk road when you dont need to, It is just plain laziness. <br /><br />i know im not in the FbI&#039;s top 10 most wanted criminals, But jesus christ that does not ever mean that i dont need to be careful. <br /><br />You wanna leave paper trails to Sr , go ahead. But seriously mate, If you think your safe because you only buy personal you dont know how wrong you are.

				I can&#039;t emphasize enough how UNsuspicious it is depositing money in someone&#039;s account by going into the bank in this country. It would be completely bizarre if the teller questioned you about any aspect of the deposit. I guess if you&#039;re depositing hundreds or thousands on a regular basis it would could be suspicious, I guess this is where LED hat would come in handy. But obviously you&#039;d go to different banks, do smaller amounts etc.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t think the point being made is that LE are going to spend a fuckload on people buying small amounts.

Not trying to panic people at all. It&#039;s essentially a precaution that you take that will only come in handy in the event of police finding something on its way to you and deciding to move on it. Obviously, the chances of that happening are small. But I still like to think that even if they tried to get me on it, they&#039;d have trouble proving I purchased it. No evidence at all beyond it being sent to me, preferably.

				agreed . Thank you for being reasonable, I appreciate it. Agree to disagree. <br /><br />My point was only that it&#039;s probably better to do it anonymously where possible just so that there is as little on you as possible. <br />Also i agree with oldcactushand in this country it is very very unusual for someone to be asked by a teller what it&#039;s for, and ID is certainly never asked for. <br /><br />But i also know that if your package was substantial , or class A (schedule 1), then there is always the possibility, And if said medical users addresse&#039;s were flagged because of not being &quot;paranoid&quot; or safety conscious enough then it would be a shame as they could no longer get packages.<br /><br />But think about it, That&#039;s gotta be good publicity for the police department catching a SR user. let alone the pressure they must be under because of the lack of arrests and the major amount of drugs being sold online. If they cant catch the big players any will do, especially users who lack protection in the online security department. <br /><br />If Le came to your door, and you refuse to sign, that&#039;s a red flag in my opinion, because think about it, anybody that wasn&#039;t expecting a package but had nothing to hide would of course sign for the package to see what they had been sent.<br />As for &quot;somebody set me up&quot;. What normal citizen gets set up? you usually have to be into some dodgy shit or involved with dodgy people to get set up any good cop knows that. Another red flag.<br />If you are somebody who is housebound, Or living in a remote area, And you have no other option, just transfer it through a couple extra instawallets and easywallets, maybe use a tumbler if it&#039;s personal use you may well be safe enough, <br />Exactly a precaution, That if you know about, you would be daft to ignore. Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />Stay safe everyone
