				I&#039;d guess it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.. unless your package get stopped.. If it does, and you already have drug crimes on your record, surely they&#039;d be more likely to believe you had something to do with it.. but still, if it&#039;d be your first seized drug package in the mail, I don&#039;t think it should be a big problem dodging charges if you did yours to keep anonymous and left no tracks.<br /><br />Maybe it varies depending on where you live, but I wouldn&#039;t think mail to lowend criminals are normally subjected to more scrutiny than to non-criminals, at least unless you&#039;re a known trafficker of drugs, suspected of terrorism or something much more serious than receiving small amounts of drugs...<br /><br />I think you will get your stuff, unless some very unfortunate bad strike of luck happens;)<br /><br />If you&#039;re really worried, try order one of the decoy packages from the Services section for a few dollars. Maybe even one scented with cannabis smell, and see if it arrives intact or not =P
