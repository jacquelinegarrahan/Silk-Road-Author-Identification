				Well, SR accounts for an undetermined amount of the Bitcoin economy (I think it&#039;s estimated at 30% or something around there).&nbsp; SR has been down for days, and now it&#039;s expected to be back up either today or in the coming days.&nbsp; If I were a betting man, I&#039;d wager that the price of bitcoins have started to rise already and will probably keep rising until SR reopens.<br /><br />Probably just somebody wagering the same thing and buying up some coins to dump when the price goes up.&nbsp; Dumping that many coins will probably drop the price back down though before they get resold. Or so they like to speculate happens on bitcointalk.org; I have literally no clue if they&#039;re right, but apparently some people think this kind of &quot;day trading&quot; (not sure what else to call it) is mostly a wash when a currency is as volatile as Bitcoin (and you can&#039;t dump a sizable pile of the currency without also driving the price down on yourself as you sell).&nbsp; Probably not missing out on any gigantic opportunity here or anything.&nbsp; Hope not at least -- that&#039;d mean I am too, since I&#039;m certainly not buying them up to sell them later either.<br /><br />Edit: I think that may actually be wrong. I was counting on buyers jumping in to buy coins when it re-opens, but I forgot about all the vendors who are gonna want to move their coins back to USD... I don&#039;t have any idea what&#039;ll happen.&nbsp; Still doesn&#039;t seem too weird to me though.&nbsp; Sometimes people buy or sell bigger-than-usual amounts.&nbsp; Maybe somebody who&#039;s been mining for ages dumped them all today.&nbsp; Who knows.

I know how to reed charts and predict movement just based on volume alone...<br /><br /><br />anyone will tell you that 30000btc in less then a morning on a monday as well is sign that something is about to happen... you dont trade 2 times the daily norm in only a few hours of trading unless something is about to happen.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m goint to check out the other bug guys and see how their volume looks..<br /><br />I will be back with an update

				looking at that link only makes me believe more and more I am correct..<br /><br />mtgox has a monthly volume of 9 hundred thousand btc... or around 10 million for the month, (30 days)<br /><br />at the rate mygox is moving coin this morning they are on track to do over 1 million usd during the day... that would be 30 million for the month.,..<br /><br /><br />do you not see that this is a wild 33% rise in one day!<br /><br />you must be able to see this... no?

				If the numbers you put out are accurate, then yes, it&#039;s uncharacteristically large volume.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t really see it as being a sign of something sinister on the horizon, as it were.&nbsp; Ever heard of Pirateat40?&nbsp; Ran Bitcoin Savings and Trust.&nbsp; Infamous.&nbsp; Accused of a massive ponzi scheme.&nbsp; I don&#039;t follow it really, but for weeks or months he&#039;s been dodging law suits and paying out small portions at a time (he says to avoid unhinging the market by dumping all investor&#039;s coins at once or something like that).&nbsp; I think he was sitting on 500k BTC or something. Was some big number anyway.<br /><br />Maybe he got fed up and liquidated.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; All I&#039;m really saying is that the cause isn&#039;t obvious to me, but it doesn&#039;t look terribly suspicious.&nbsp; Unusual perhaps, but I don&#039;t see any reason to head for the nearest bunker.

I&#039;m not saying someone here is up to some malicious shit, but the numbers do not lie.<br /><br /><br />also looking into the numbers while typing this there has been over another 30k USD moved through mtgox.... I expect to see about 100kbtc moved through them today... that would actually be 66% more then the average!<br /><br /><br />66% more would mean there is someone moving a large amount... that&#039;s all wer can conclude from this... This is not just more btc buyers, this is a big player moving mad coin!

He ran a ponzi.. He took in coins and paid out from the coins he took in.. He didn&#039;t pay anyone back.. he disappeared after stalling for a while...&nbsp; He probably ended up with very little BTC compared to what he took in. He also RAN GPUMAX....
