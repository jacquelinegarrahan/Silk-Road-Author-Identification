				What would be the safest way to get BTC? I was thinking of using bitinstant+tormail, then send it through bitcoinfog to instawallet, then to my SR account. However, this has a lot of taxes built in it. Is it just as safe as using Sugar Mama to get my BTC?<br /><br /><br />Edit: Apparently, bitinstant took away the &quot;to email&quot; bitcoin thing. If I send it to my mtgox account, doesn&#039;t it mean that I need to provide ID for my account? Should I just transfer the coins to multiple instawallets multiple times?<br /><br />Edit 2: OR&nbsp; could I use a different service, such as cryptoxchange, bitstamp, or virwox?

For a full explanation as to why this please see here : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=25163.0<br /><br />In the US the two fellow BTC traders I know well are BlueSkyTraders and Coinbox (like me, Coinbox offers a cash in the mail service which is the most secure way to receive your coins).<br /><br />V.
