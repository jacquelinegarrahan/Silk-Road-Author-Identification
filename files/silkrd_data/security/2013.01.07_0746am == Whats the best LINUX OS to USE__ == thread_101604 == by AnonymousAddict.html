				I know of 2 different Liberte USB boot implementations - Liberte Linux and Tails.<br /><br />You&#039;ll find much discussion comparing the 2 both on here and on clearnet, and just when you&#039;ve thought you figured out which one is more secure based on the info on the net, you find enough convincing counter-info to put you back to square one in terms of choosing between the 2.. As far as I know, they are both very secure and come with basically everything you need to access darknet and SR relatively securely. I have read that if you&#039;re using Liberte, you&#039;re better of downloading and installing the &quot;Tor Browser Bundle&quot; on top as it&#039;s significantly faster than the built in TOR browser in Liberte. There may be other benefits but I&#039;m not too sure here.<br /><br />Anyways, my 2 cents, but no doubt some of the more knowledgeable SR members will jump in and help you out further.<br /><br />Good luck!

				Stick with Tails and the instructions I gave in the other thread.<br /><br />You are way too confused at this point to be considering options. Stick with one thing and make it work, then you can explore other options. :)

				I personally think Liberte is a fantastic choice although you will need some skill to be able to adjust the OS to your computer, so you&#039;ll have to figure out few things sometimes and how to configure your hardware and boot options which it maybe somehow challenging ....but if you are willing to read and study a little it can be pretty rewarding .... ;) ;)

				After seeing a poll in these forums that indicates (I think) about 55% of SR users use Linux I decided to check it out. You don&#039;t have to do much reading to find out just what crap&nbsp; M$ products really are. <br />Anyway if your question is which OS is best (non-security hardened) I decided to try out Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon. I have to say after a couple weeks I realized I wasn&#039;t even using Winblows anymore, wiped Windoze and did a permanent install. I love this OS and it gets great reviews. I am glad to say that I am now 100% M$ free. <br />You can download and boot it off of your USB to play with it for a while, and if you want to go to the next level you can install it right from the USB as either dual boot with your existing Winhose or as a standalone.<br />The learning curve is not that bad. It worked for me &quot;right out of the box&quot;. The desktop is very Winholes looking, but of course everything is different under the hood. I&#039;ve even helped a couple friends ditch M$. Man I&#039;d love to see M$ pound sand. I think their day is coming. Give it a try!<br />As for security hardened solutions you&#039;ve already heard about Liberte and Tails so I&#039;m also going to mention Whonix. It is not portable, but it is a whole lot more customizable. It runs two virtual machines in Virtualbox, which you can put on your Winbloat machine if you wish. I wouldn&#039;t do it. You can&#039;t even trust Winfroze as a freaking host it&#039;s just that crappy.<br />
