				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">UK Banking Announcement<br />UPDATE 2012-08-30 Unfortuantely due to a technical error with Metro&#039;s online banking system we are now locked out of the account. This appears to be identical to problems we have had in the past with Metro banks online banking. Unfortunately in the past it took several days for Metro to provide us with a workaround.<br /><br />This annoucement is for transfers to/from our Metro bank account in the UK. This does not effect transfers to our account at BZWBK in poland (EUR/PLN).<br /><br />Last month actions by Metro bank caused serious issues for both us and our users. During an investigation by Metro, access to our account was restricted and all activity halted. After the investigation was finished, we were told that payments were now going through to the account. However before payments were resumed a technical glitch in online banking prevented us from accessing the account for an additional week. It took yet another week to catch up with the hundreds of issues caused by these problems.<br /><br />Ever since, we have been speaking with industry experts and searching for other banking or payment solutions appropriate for our business. While we have not yet formalized an agreement, we are in talks with many such service providers.<br /><br />At the end of this month Metro bank will discontinue our account. There will almost certainly be a period of time in which UK payments will be unavailable. We strive to provide our users with the best service possible. Unfortunately we cannot control the services which we rely upon.<br /><br />Transfers in EUR can be made from our BZWBK account to UK accounts, however we cannot convert GBP to EUR for this purpose.<br /><br />Bridging the gap between the conventional banking system and bitcoin is a challenging and expensive task. We have had many issues dealing with the conventional banking system; missing transfers, various crippling technical issues, accounts frozen without warning, and even accounts closed without warning. This is why we love bitcoin, it just works.<br /><br />There are a limited number of UK banks which provide business banking accounts. If you are a UK journalist and would like a more comprehensive understanding of bitcoins and the implications an unofficial and unelected potential future banking blockade could lead to, please email press@intersango.com</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I must have needed my head testing using them again after their last fiasco but I actually thought they&#039;d sorted their UK banking issues out (at least until the END of the month, when their ties with Metro bank were due to be severed). Only deposited a relatively small amount but once again it&#039;s likely to be tied up for weeks, if I ever see it back at all that is.&nbsp; &gt;:(
