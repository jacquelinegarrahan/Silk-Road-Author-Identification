				I have been using silk road for a few months now via payments direct to intersango but i put as little as money through it as possible as i dont want to put the cash in my bank due to reasons. I tend to use ukash for big orders but the fee rates to bitcoin are high, can anyone give me an easier/safer solution at all to get large amounts of cash into bitcoins? 1000-5000 GBP+ Without using banks.

				I would also like to know this answer! I haven&#039;t yet, but I will be depositing cash into a UK Barclays account (via Mt.Gox) in order to trade for Bitcoins but I&#039;m a little apprehensive in doing that so I&#039;m basically stuck.<br /><br />You say that you make payments direct to intersango, is that www.britcoin.co.uk ? I was thinking of joining there but saw that you need to do an electronic bank transfer, is that how you did it? Will you not be directly implicated then if you do that? How will you get those Bitcoins to your SR account anonymously?<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Peter.

				You know that you can do bank transfer at a bank without having an actual account. The bank you got to will just add the money to one of their accounts and send it from their. This costs about 5 to 10 Euro but you won&#039;t have any transfers connected to your bank account.<br /><br />Add this to Intersango&#039;s easy account creation(no id verification etc) and you have the greatest anonmity possible apart from Cash in Mail,as long as you access intersango from TOR obviously.
