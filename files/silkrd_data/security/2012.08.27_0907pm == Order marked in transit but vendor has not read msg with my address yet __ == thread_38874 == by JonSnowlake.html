				I placed an order. I didn&#039;t put in my address at first but a couple days later sent the address in a msg to the vendor. A couple hours later the status of my order changed from processing, to &quot;in Transit&quot; so I was thinking, &quot;Goody he&#039;s mailed it&quot; however when I checked to see whether he had read my message with the address the msg is marked unread. Now it&#039;s been a couple of days and the message is still marked unread. Is this normal practice ? Should I email the vendor and ask what is going on ? Unless he&#039;s psychic or SR msging made a mistake there&#039;s no way the package is in the mail...&nbsp; ??? and it&#039;s going to autofinalize 17 days after he put it &quot;in transit.&quot; Is this normal ?

				If they click on your name instead of read in their messages, they can still read the message &amp; it will still be marked as unread. Don&#039;t know if this is what the vendor did, but it is possible.

				Thanks, that&#039;s good to know. I was wondering, &quot;When is he going to read my message&quot; but I also figured there might be some things I wasn&#039;t considering so good to know.

				You know how when you placed your order their was that little window for you to type your shipping address, well when a vendor looks at their orders, it shows them the address that you gave them. They do not have to read a message from you to see the address, unless you did something other then that.

				Yeah I did something other than that. <br /><br />See this bit of my first post: <br />I didn&#039;t put in my address at first but a couple days later sent the address in a msg to the vendor. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />I didn&#039;t put my address in the address box. I sent it to him in a message later. Probably was a little time consuming for him to have to read another msg apart from the order, next time I&#039;ll make sure and put it in the addy box, but anyway that&#039;s what happened and that&#039;s why I&#039;m wondering if he (or she) read the msg.

				Do you think I should msg and inquire when it was shipped ? I&#039;d like to know when I can expect it so that, next week or a few weeks later I&#039;m not saying &quot;It&#039;s been 14 days&quot; when really it&#039;s only been 10 or whatever.
