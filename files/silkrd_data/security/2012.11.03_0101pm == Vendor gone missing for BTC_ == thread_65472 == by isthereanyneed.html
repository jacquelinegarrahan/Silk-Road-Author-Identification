				Hello, I sent a vendor who also sells BTC a bank transfer yesterday at 11:15am in order to buy BTC he has been a member for 1 year has made over 300 sales and has 98% positive feedback, my friend recommended him and has no trouble and said he usually has BTC in his account within a few hours however it has now been over 24 hours and still no BTC in my account and still no reply to my messages, it also said on his profile he has not been seen since yesterday?<br /><br />At this point I am not really to worried as it would be very silly for a vendor with such a good rep to turn scam over a fairly small amount I am a little worried that something might of happened to his account maybe hacked or maybe hes been arrested who knows but surely he should have at least got in touch with me to say he had received the bank transfer?<br /><br />Any help at this point would be helpful folks, thanks.

				SR&#039;s connectivity has been hit or miss to say the least all week. Be patient, I&#039;m sure a vendor of that stature will come through for you. If anything, send a PM and sit tight.

				I&#039;ve been having the hardest time getting BTC; my bank transfer completed on the 29th and Dwolla keeps pushing back the date it&#039;ll be available, BitInstant isn&#039;t working with online banks right now (I mean, their intermediary isn&#039;t allowing them, it&#039;s not by choice), I got scammed tryna exchange a $%00 MoneyPak (I was desperate and excited and thus, stupid).<br /><br />Long to short, once he gets you your BTC, think you could give me his name so I can make an exchange? (This is an open invite to anyone. I&#039;ll cover all of escrow and I&#039;ll buy in as little as $100 increments. I&#039;m looking for about $500 in total. Ideally this would be through a major bank where I can just bring cash and tell them to put it in your account.)<br /><br />Sorry for being a thread barnacle and double-thread jacking - maybe my complaining made you feel better?:D

				Hello isthereanyneed,<br /><br />It sounds as if you are dealing with a long-standing, reputable vendor.<br />I would say the connectivity issues are the reason for the slow exchange.<br /><br />I would just try to be patient if I were you.

				Thanks for replies folks,<br /><br />Still no further forward no reply or BTC in my account but as you say this guy has to much of a good rep to harm it by turning scam over less than 200 euros, I will just sit tight and wait for a reply I will let you guys know as soon as they go into my account and I will send you PM DreDri if you want to use him when he comes through.

				If the vendor in question is ONE STOP SHOP as I suspect it is, then you need to be worried. Go to his vendor page and look at his recent feedback.

				No its not theonestopshop thankfully feel sorry for the folks using this after what I have been reading, yeah it would be foolish to worry about a vendor of this caliber I just wish I knew what was going on he had feedback this morning all good something has clearly went wrong he has not turned scam I can just feel it, it just would not make any sense, how would I get his email?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Does his username start with a P and end with a 1? If so, read the above threads created I just read one of a guy apologizing for disapearing that his sr account is messed up but will be up and running soon as he can and the coins will be sent then.
