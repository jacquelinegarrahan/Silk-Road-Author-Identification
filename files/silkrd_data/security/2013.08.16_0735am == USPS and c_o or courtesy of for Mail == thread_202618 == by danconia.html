				I want to know what your guys&#039; thoughts are for using &quot;c/o&quot; or &quot;courtesy of&quot; on mail for the recipient.&nbsp; For instance if I were to have a package sent to &quot;[My Name] c/o [Resident]&quot;, how much risk is each person at?&nbsp; As I understand it, &quot;c/o&quot; means &quot;courtesy of&quot; which essentially means that the resident is being requested to delivery the mail from their residence to someone they know (who usually is staying with them at their residence or meeting up with them at some point).&nbsp; The &quot;someone they know&quot; in this case would mean [My Name].<br /><br />I believe this is typically used if, for example, I am visiting someone in a different area and having mailed delivered to that someone&#039;s mailing address, and it is to keep the USPS from being confused since the [My Name] person typically doesn&#039;t actually live or work at the address.<br /><br />I am considering having mail sent to a relative&#039;s place as &quot;[My Name] c/o [Relative&#039;s Name]&quot;... would this work or look more suspicious?&nbsp; Heck better yet what if the [My Name] part were just some made up name?&nbsp; Would love any informed (or uninformed) feedback on this.

				You are better off just having it sent to your house and denying if something were to go wrong.<br /><br />The &quot;c/o&quot; idea makes it look as if the order was more orchistrated and not as blatent as having it sent to yourself. You would loose a lot of the capability to just deny.<br /><br />Also, why would you want to put your relative at risk. That pretty much is like 2 people going down for one package.
