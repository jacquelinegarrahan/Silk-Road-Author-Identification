				Ah yeah, check.torproject.org has been down all day. I didn&#039;t get an error message, it just didn&#039;t connect.<br /><br />Obviously if you&#039;re on a hidden service like this forum, Tor is working for you.<br />

				If check.torproject.org is down, you can use (clearnet) http://ip-check.info/?lang=en, but as astor and enpiping said, if you&#039;re on the forums without using the .to service, TOR must be working for you. :)<br /><br />

				O ok. I&#039;v never seen that before, so it sketched me out. Did u see it also jack? <br /><br />Has a HUGE ONION with a Red X though it an says this<br /><br />&nbsp;Sorry, check is temporarily disabled until we can fix it. (If you&#039;re reading this with Tor Browser Bundle, your Tor is working fine.)<br />A temporary service outage prevents us from determining if your source IP address is a Tor node.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I just noticed my TBB needed to be updated so i guess im about to do tht. Question though! <br /><br />Is it Necessary to UPDATE the Browser bundle ever time?<br />

				Let&#039;s just go with Yes.<br /><br />Some updates merely update the version numbers of the TBB components, but some include fixes for critical security vulnerabilities (like that websockets thing last year), but most people aren&#039;t going to check the blog to see what the update is for. So to stay safe, just update immediately every time.<br />

				torstatus.blutmagie.de&nbsp; &nbsp; Performs the same function as<br />check.torproject.org<br />But it also loads a list of all active tor nodes which makes it a bit slow to use as a replacement.&nbsp; So if you really wanted you could use it in the meantime but it&#039;s probably not worth.&nbsp; After all if you can get to addresses ending in .onion you&#039;re using TOR.

				i just posted this in another similar thread but oh well....<br /><br /><br />I also recieved this message now, I thought that it was a backdoor being created to see what websites i accessed but now that i am seeing other people saying the same thing, (this is after i searched to see if the message was widespread which it appeared to be, hence why im on here now) I reckon the problem actually is with tor. I use tails so everything gets routed through tor anyway.<br /><br />Wonder how safe it is, or if LE might have cracked a tor node properly.. Because it also says &quot;A temporary service outage prevents us from determining if your source IP address is a Tor node.&quot; <br />It does say your ip adress appears to be &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot; however i know that the one shown is not my own ip so im not sure whats going on.<br />Modify message<br />
