				Something that&#039;s got me curious is ways to maximize the anonymity of sellers here at a the point of buying an account. Strangely, it rarely seems to be mentioned as a weak point until now.<br /><br />With every single bitcoin transaction effectively being public, combined with the relatively standardized rate of buying an account here, has anyone else spotted that this might be a potential vulnerability?<br /><br />Let&#039;s worst case scenario and add into the mix that hypothetically SR has been breached by LE at some point in the recent past and some form of authorities are now running the site. So now when you&#039;re buying a seller account, you&#039;re paying that authority. Would you do things differently to protect yourself more? <br /><br />The complacent may well say there&#039;s a 99.9% chance that LE aren&#039;t involved with admin here, but for the purposes of this thread I&#039;m only interested in the 0.1% possibility that they are. It&#039;s far higher than that incidentally - it&#039;s also worth bearing in mind that an attack from within is likely how any future LE takedown would take place, and just because SR is still running doesn&#039;t necessarily mean the authorities haven&#039;t already compromised it. There&#039;s no chance they&#039;d opt for an immediate shut down if recent history is to go by (darkmarket, sabu etc), just think of the goldmine of data they could obtain by keeping it operational.<br /><br />With all of that in mind,&nbsp; interested in sharing thoughts about procedures to maximize anonymity when buying a seller account.
