				I am concerned about LE bugging my house/car. It is a common trick used by LE.<br /><br />There are many bug detectors on the market and also jammers of types.<br /><br />Can anyone advise me on what I should buy? Perhaps a bug jammer of types?<br /><br />Thanks ahead<br /><br />Q

				I wouldn&#039;t call it common. I&#039;ve actually never heard of bugging other than for unsolved murder investigations that are embarrassing LE. I can&#039;t even imagine LE investing the resources in bugging someone for drugs. Not to be rude, but you&#039;re getting busted long before they&#039;d go as far as to bug your home or vehicle.

				zxydwx3 you must not read much about law enforcement operations because bugging is extremely common. I know at least one busted internet vendor who had his car bugged with a GPS tracking device to aid in LE surveillance of him. It is also extremely common for bugs to be used in the form of wires, and hidden cameras have also been used in computer crime investigations, and physical key loggers have been used extensively as well. Not to be rude, but get a clue before you comment.<br /><br />As far as bug detection goes, to the best of my understanding you are not going to be able to afford a professional bug detecting kit. The kits used by actual professionals cost upwards of $100,000. I have heard that the bug detecting equipment you can buy on the internet for cheap is great for detecting bugs that you can buy on the internet for cheap (often from the same stores), but that it is not truly professional grade equipment. The professional name for bug detection equipment is TSCM, technical surveillance counter measure equipment. A quick search reveals stores selling kits for a few hundred dollars, but searching for truly professional grade equipment shows single devices ranging from between $3,000 to $80,000.

				Also you need significant training to even know what to do with professional grade equipment once you have it. Bug detection is an entire profession and it requires months to years of training and tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. If your attacker gets their bugging equipment from we-sell-spy-gear.info then you are probably good to go with bug detecting equipment from we-sell-bug-detecting-equipment.info , but if they are using professional grade equipment it will require professional grade equipment to detect it.

				This seems sort of obvious to me, but if you&#039;re a big enough target that police are willing to bug your car to discover you, then you are presumably making a fair bit of money, and should wisely invest that money in alternative vehicles. <br /><br />Use 1 vehicle for drug trips, maybe you keep this in your garage and under surveilence, make LE unable to get to it. Be sure to check for trails and what not when you go out driving and do clean-runs to make sure you&#039;re not being followed or to make sure they wont try to pull you over.<br /><br />Use another car for going out/partying, one that one matter if they bug. <br /><br />Etc, you get the idea. This could be troublesome if you have neighbors, driving multiple cars all the time... but as I like to say, when there&#039;s a will, there&#039;s a way. Only you know your circumstance, so only you can really come up with a complete and safe solution.
