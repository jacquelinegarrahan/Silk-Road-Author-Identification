				Title: <strong>My experience with moneygram at CVS..</strong><br />

				I know that every one and their dog come to the forums to learn how the heck do every thing required to buy stuff from SR..<br /><br />This was my first time buying bitcoins, and I chose to use moneygrams at CVS (bad mistake).. Here is my experience and what I learned from my first time of buying coins:<br /><br />1: bitinstant.com charges a 4% fee..<br /><br />2: zipzap charges AN OTHER fee (about $3.95).. But it is actually the fee to use moneygram..<br /><br />3: The CVS people will think they need to charge you an other fee, but THEY ARE WRONG! The only fees you pay are from points #1 and #2.. You see, MOST of the time, the type of moneygrams the CVS people handle are those types that don&#039;t already have a fee tacked on to them, so they think that you need to pay the moneygram fee.. But in fact, YOUR moneygram fee is *already* included!.. The USD amount that you wrote on the blue moneygram form is the GRAND TOTAL you will have to pay, and not a penny more!..<br /><br />4: When you first walk in to the store (with your blue moneygram form already filled out), you will need to use the RED PHONE to call the moneygram people (they are all people in india with accents).. Just pick up the phone.. You will hear a dial tone, and then after a second it will dial a number automatically.. You will use the touch-tone pad to enter in some information (from the moneygram form), and then you will be transferred to an actual (indian) person.. They will ask you stuff, so just read them the (possibly fake) information from the blue moneygram form.. After that is done they (moneygram people on the phone) will enter in to their computer the exact store you are in, so that your transaction information is in the CVS computer when you go to the counter..<br /><br />5: The CVS person has to type in the amount the moneygram is for.. They need to type the EXACT amount, or their computer will error.. Don&#039;t let them try to second-guess extra fees or whatever, because all the fees are already included.. They need to type the same amount that is on the blue moneygram form..<br /><br />6: THEY REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION!!.. I didn&#039;t learn this until just now when I tried it my self.. But he kept saying he needed to see my ID.. But I used fake information on the moneygram form, so I said I don&#039;t have ID.. And he said he requires it.. And I said &quot;No you don&#039;t&quot;, and he said &quot;Yes I do&quot;, and I said &quot;No you don&#039;t&quot;.. and he finally asked his manager.. His manager came and said &quot;Yes, we require ID, but I can make an exception just this one time&quot;.. (that was close!)..<br /><br />7: The CLERK at the CVS is the one that gives you the confirmation number (on the receipt)!!.. The stupid person I got at CVS kept telling me that the moneygram people on the red phone were supposed to give me the confirmation number, but that is WRONG!.. The people on the red phone don&#039;t give the confirmation number (also known as reference number), the CVS person gives it to you after you pay the money!..<br /><br />So, the main lesson is, CVS asks for ID! But also, apparently the manager can let you not have to show it if you are convincing enough..

				I haven&#039;t had an issue with clerks asking me for id at cvs, and I&#039;ve used a few of them. Although I always tend to get girls in their twenties as clerks so that helps.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the heads up about CVS having under trained employees.&nbsp; I had considered trying it instead of walmart to mix up my patterns, but it looks like I&#039;ll just have to stick to walmart where all I gotta do is fill out a form and hand them some cash.&nbsp; They do not need ID, nor have I ever been asked, just make sure the name/address you used online is the same you use on the form you hand the customer service rep.&nbsp; Every time though they mention that my moneygram has no fee, seriously every time...I always have a different rep ring me up too.&nbsp; I just mention the fee was built into the moneygram already and they seem to understand.&nbsp;
