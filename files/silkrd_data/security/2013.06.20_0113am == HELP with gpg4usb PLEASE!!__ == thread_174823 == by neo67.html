				Is it crashing when you click the import key button, or when you actually try to import the key?

				I copy a key, then select import key, the select from clipboard, a loading up sign appears then it just crashes, saying &#039;start_windows.exe&#039; has stopped running&#039;. i have tried to uninstalled it and then reinstall it again many of times but with no joy.<br /><br />Have you any ideas astor? Any thoughts are much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you

				My first thought is that the key is too big to import, or it&#039;s malformed somehow and causing the crash. Would you mind PMing it to me so I can take a look at it?<br /><br />Alternatively, you could try importing without the GUI. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where you extracted GPG4USB. There should be a subfolder called bin. In that subfolder will be a program called gpg.exe.&nbsp; That&#039;s the actual gpg program.<br /><br />Save the key in that folder, in a text file called whatever.asc. Then at the command prompt, while you&#039;re in that folder, type:<br /><br />&nbsp; gpg.exe --import whatever.asc<br /><br />It&#039;ll either import properly or if it fails, it should print an error message.<br /><br />Copy the error message and paste it here.<br />

				Have you tried many different keys and it&#039;s happening with all of them, or it just happens with one key?

				just tried it with a different key and it was the same outcome.....the program crashed.<br /><br />I am getting really worried now as i wont be able to encrypt my address and i will be stuck with privnote! lol which ive heard is unsafe.<br /><br />However, i will follow your instructions for the command prompt <br /><br />Do you still want me to send you the public key?

				In case you don&#039;t know how to get the command prompt to that folder, I think in the file manager, when you&#039;re in that folder, you can right click and there should be an option to &quot;open the command prompt here&quot; or something like that. It&#039;s been forever since I&#039;ve seen that though.

				Sure, send me one of the keys that made it crash, although if multiple keys are doing it, that&#039;s bad.<br /><br />If you can get them imported without the GUI, that&#039;s a crappy workaround at least. Maybe you will still be able to use them to encrypt your address in the GUI. Otherwise, I don&#039;t know honestly. You&#039;ll have to use a different PGP program.<br /><br />I can look into if other people are experiencing consistent crashes, but I haven&#039;t heard of that before.

				Are you on Windows 8 by any chance? That&#039;s the second thought that comes to mind. The browser bundle didn&#039;t work on Win8 when it first came out, so programs built for Win7 are not always compatible with Win8, apparently. Has anyone successful run GPG4USB and imported keys on Win8?<br />

				Ok, it imported just fine for me, so it&#039;s not the key. Try to do it at the command prompt. If that doesn&#039;t work, you&#039;ll have to use something else.<br /><br />Well, even if it imports, you may not be able to encrypt stuff in the GUI.<br /><br />I&#039;ll see what I can dig up on GPG4USB crashes.<br />

				Oh yeah, before importing it at the command prompt, you could save the key to a text file and try importing it that way rather than from the clipboard, but I fear this may be problem with the GUI in general.
