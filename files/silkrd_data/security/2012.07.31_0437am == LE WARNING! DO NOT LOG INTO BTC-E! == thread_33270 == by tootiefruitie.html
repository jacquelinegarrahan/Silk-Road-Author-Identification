				many of you should know my name, and know that i am a paranoid person, but still fiercely anti-fearmongering.&nbsp; so please just hear me out, and just wait until it is shown that i am only being paranoid.<br /><br />i&#039;m mostly pasting this from what i typed in chat, because time matters right now<br /><br />04:21:01 AM) tootiefrootie: btc-e is currently trading above 30usd<br />(04:21:16 AM) tootiefrootie: with a few hundred thousand invested in buy orders above 20<br />(04:21:27 AM) tootiefrootie: any trader doing that would stand to lose most of that money<br />(04:21:50 AM) tootiefrootie: but it sure would make a tempting honeypot for anyone with a large amount of btc <br />(04:22:00 AM) tootiefrootie: which we all know.... includes sr vendors<br />(04:22:16 AM) tootiefrootie: also, btc-e recently became aggresively ant-tor.<br />(04:22:40 AM) tootiefrootie: freezing funds until documents are provided if your account is ever accessed through tor<br />(04:23:01 AM) tootiefrootie: i&#039;ve been saying for months that if LE makes a big move it will be one the money end<br />(04:23:14 AM) tootiefrootie: please listen until we figure out i&#039;m just being paranoid!

				How about accessing it with a proxy server? I&#039;m just not going to sit around and let my couple hundred bucks disappear without any effort. If it was some sort of bust then I&#039;m a small fry and they&#039;re after the big time players.

				vinnyg007: at this point, most major services or exchanges are no longer honoring btc-e vouchers, or allowing transfers to/from btc-e in any form.&nbsp; i&#039;m not sure what is happening on btc-e as far as being allowed to transfer out btc. obviously if you were able to do that, you could move it wherever you wanted.&nbsp; we still don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on for sure, and only you can properly judge your security and weigh it against your value of freedom vs. money.<br /><br />the fact that transfers to/from btc-e are stopped is a sign that it might not be a honeypot, or that if it is, other exchanges did not (at least fully) participate.<br /><br />in my rush to spread the word, i accidentally posted too many of these threads.&nbsp; i updated another already that it is shaping up to look more like some sort of exploit/hack<br /><br /><br />

				Fuuuuuuuuuuck I tried withdrawing earlier and it didn&#039;t appear in the blockchain and no funds have hit my other wallet. Maybe the coin will show up. Fuck I hate Russia. I should have just kept it in Gox.
