				SR doesn&#039;t change its address.<br /><br />If that would happen, you can come here, to the forums.<br />Or you could go to the HiddenWiki (http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) but beware that there SR address is frequently changed by scammers.<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t trust the Hidden Wiki at all... right now the real Silk Road is listed as a phisher site.

				The first place I entered the Silk Road from was the link on the Silk Road Wikipedia entry, however I have never purchased anything to find out if that address is from phishers.

				So far I&#039;ve used the one from Wikipedia (the URL ending in &quot;ulzz.onion&quot;) and haven&#039;t had any issues (meaning my account is still my own). I&#039;ve made a purchase from that URL and had no issue. So, from what I can tell, that&#039;s the only legit URL.<br /><br />Has anyone else been using anything different?
