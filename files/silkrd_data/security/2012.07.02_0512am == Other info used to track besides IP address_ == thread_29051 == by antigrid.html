				What other information might be used to trace vendors or buyers on SR besides IP address such as host / computer name, system time etc? Are they commonly used? What is the best counter measure for these?

				Meta data in photos you upload. Make sure you scrub them! There was a hacker that uploaded a photo and was caught, not realizing that his iPhone stored GPS data of where the photo was taken! Lol.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />http://now.msn.com/now/0413-hacker-boobs-captured.aspx

				One of the primary techniques used by law enforcement to deanonymize people they can&#039;t technically trace is simply data mining and profiling. People give away enough bits of information about themselves over long enough a period of time, law enforcement gathers all these bits and makes a profile of the person, and eventually the profile they make is good enough for them to determine who the person is. Saying one or two little things about yourself is probably no big deal in itself, but if you do this enough times eventually you will probably deanonymize yourself.

				Actually for vendors you can probably deanonymize yourself very quickly by saying things about yourself. LE is already aware of your rough location based on shipping information. So if you say something like &quot;fuck I got in a car wreck the other night&quot; law enforcement can quickly check records of such events and find a list of potential suspects. Even saying something as innocent as &quot;I rented this movie within the past two weeks&quot; can get your name on a short list of suspects. <br /><br />I would say this sort of attack is the leading cause of deanonymization in people who are technically secure.
