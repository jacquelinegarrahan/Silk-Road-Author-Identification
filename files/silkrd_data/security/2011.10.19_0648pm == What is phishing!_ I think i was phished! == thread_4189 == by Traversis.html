				My bitcoins mysteriously disappeared, 42 of them! There was a noteless withdraw. Unless it due to an error with the outage, i think somebody stole them. Anyways, what is this phishing phenomenon that i read about?

				I&#039;m not sure - but I went to the Tor Directory, which lists a gang of sites, while I&#039;m waiting for the main site to be back up. And I usually go to Social: Talk Masked site to chat anonymously. There, about 5 or 6 links/onions above the TalkMasked site, is one labelled &quot;Phishing Scam&quot; then &quot;Silk Road&quot;. It posts a link, which is NOT the same as the one I have bookmarked (which I was told&nbsp; do in the very beginning to AVOID phishing scams.) The onion (http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/index.php) appears to be the same as the normal SR site, however, since it IS different than the one I normally go to through my bookmarked sites, I won&#039;t login.

				if you ever used a link from hidden wiki to log in you have probably been phished. only use a bookmark or if you must you can find the address on gawker article or something but never use hidden wiki link or any link that is editable by users.

There are a dozen different sites that are designed to look like the Silk Road login site, you enter your name and password their, and the owner of that fake site has it and can use it to steal from you.<br /><br />Never, ever, ever trust the Hidden Wiki to have the right address.

				it is really quite simple to build a phishing site, and surprisingly, hundreds of people log into them each day. I see your user id in my phishing database more than any other user traversis, but when I logged in to your account, first there were no bitcoins to be had, but then the following day, there had been coins there, but they had already been taken by another phisher. I will do you a favor. this is the real Silk road address. save this address to a text file and ONLY use this test file to get the link!<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/<br /><br />It is surprising how many people use the hidden wiki to go direct to the store, and not the forum. I think the link to the store should be listed somewhere on the main page of the forum, because people like me never mess with the forum link on the hidden wiki, and if people didn&#039;t use our phishing links, we would be forced to try to scam peoples bitcoins from them. (this is more profitable, but also more time consuming) scamming on Silk road has paid off about 10k USD over the course of about two months, but phishing has only made me about $500 this week. unfortunately, I haven&#039;t had the time to devote to running scams this week, and the SR outage has slowed the phishing success, but I will be happy to give some help to SR with an idea to help stop phishers like me from being able to take BTC from people too lazy to check their links.

				If there were an implementation of a seperate password used for withdraws, and user transfers, and it was either generated by SR and given during registration, unique for each user, and not changeable without approval, even when people like me got a login ID and password, we wouldn&#039;t be able to withdraw the bitcoins anywhere. our only option would be to change the login password, and use the account to purchase from the store. then anyone who sold to that user id would have the physical address of the phishers, and that could be used to discourage people from putting up phishing sites unless they were VERY elaborate to be able to harvest the withdraw password

				a couple of things In my defence, first, I don&#039;t need the money, so 95% of what I get I donate to various charities, second, my phishing site is NOTHING like the actual SR site, and last, I spend alot more time messing up the pedo sites than stealing from silk roaders who don&#039;t have the sense to spot a fake. If I had more knowlege of actual hacking, I would gladly lend my services to help bring down the pedo sites completely, but I do what I can (even if that means only changing the hidden wiki links to pedo sites to fbi.gov) <br /><br />I also will gladly help anyone who needs help with basics like setting up and using pgp, donate btc to anyone who asks, and help people spot scams like mine.&nbsp; sometimes it takes a thief to stop a thief<br /><br />also, when I am running a scam, if anyone asks me directly if I am scamming, my answer is always &quot;yes&quot;.

				as soon as SR is back up, I will send you over some coins. If you dont want to wait till then, go to <br /><br />https://www.instawallet.org/w/xoyfQOaJeMu2IRJnGZmTng<br /><br />you can&#039;t send the coins to another address until there is 1 network confirmation, so keep an eye on the block chain and transfer it as soon as you can<br /><br />and there will be some BTC there waiting for you, but get there quick because this is posted on an open forum

				last bit of advise is change your passwords often. I personally change my password each time I log in to an account I actually use. also, make your password secure. it doesn&#039;t have to be a word or number just some jibberish with symbols like ╖Φ&lt;, etc&nbsp; and put it in your text file along with the address. then just copy and paste....then change it

				Wow, I wrote that before you posted! Finally some good luck! You are a good man, sir, and thank you for doing everything you can to stop the pedo sites, that is truly noble. I will have to wait for silk to return as I have no wallet yet and don&#039;t want to risk waiting to get one, Would you consider the 40 i lost, that would be a very good gift. More or less, thank you in either case.<br /><br />&nbsp;Good things to you for you! Let me know if i can help you in any way! Im already going to say good things should the opportuinity arise

				well, someone jumped right on that offer, because those BTC are already transfered! if it wasn&#039;t you traversis, I will send you some when SR is back up. I don&#039;t know how many I have in my SR wallet, but if I can do 40, I will.&nbsp; A lot of the bitcoins I had last week went to sending food and deodorant to the occupy wallstreet crowd, but I should have enough left to get you back what you lost.

				I would like to know who took them though. I have no problem telling the whole SR community that I stole them to begin with, but who took them when they were supposed to go to traversis? I would bet that it was one of the &quot;he is so bad for doing that&quot; crowd, but what you&#039;ve just done is no different than what I have been doing, so just post here that you took them! I will continue to do what I&#039;ve been doing, regardless, and I will keep my word to you traversis, I just want to know who else is just like me.

				I&#039;ve had ethics my whole life, but only been a thief for a few years. like I said earlier, I do not need the money, I find it fun...almost more fun than taking drugs. definately more fun than gambling, and there are people who do need the money and cant raise it. so my thoughts are that if people have enough money to be spending on drugs from anon sources, they could easily donate it to those who are being thrown from their homes, and have lost their jobs.<br /><br />so yes, I am a thief with ethics

				sorry you guys feel that way, but my phishing site looks nothing like the real SR, and like I said, when I set up scam products for sale, I only take money from those who either do direct transfers, or release payment early without asking any questions to me. you would be surprised how many people on here see a listing for cocaine, and just buy it, and release funds as soon as I put it &quot;in transit&quot; without so much as a single question to me about the product, quality, &quot;are you a real person&quot; or anything for that matter. I am sure you&#039;ve heard that a fool and his money are soon parted. be a dumbass and transfer your money to someone without ANY real reason to do it, or log into a silk road page with a different background color than your used to (mine is VERY different than the real SR) and you too will be parted with your money. But if you pay attention to what the fuck your doing here, ask questions, expect proof from sellers (same as I&#039;m sure you would on a street corner) you won&#039;t lose any money here. By the way, would you ever walk up to someone on a street corner because you heard he sold drugs, hand him a couple hundred bucks, then wait for him to come back a couple days later with your shit?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t fucking think so.<br />occupy wallstreet was what I did last week, not because I agree with their cause or anything other than it seemed like a good thing to do. there are two major childrens hospitals that the money usually goes to, because I DO believe in the work they do, and I will take money from anyone stupid enough to give it to me to help their cause<br /><br /><br />anyway, who took the 12 BTC I put in an instawallet for traversis? I bet it was you shiznit or mrgrey..

				You know what, I appreciate your advice fisher. The thing is, I&#039;d rather be scammed on a small time scale, than a large scale one, obviously. And stupidity is a disease, and those with this disease should suffer. If someone takes the time to think, and analyze their actions, and has a bit of common sense, you wouldn&#039;t get scammed. <br /><br />I am appalled at all the hate you all have for fisher, at least he is being honest and divulging information to prevent this from happening, and if you learn from people&#039;s mistakes, you&#039;re golden. <br /><br />As for having a phishing site of SR, that I can&#039;t agree with. I know people have desires for money and such, but SR fostered people to revolutionize their thinking, and their actions. We are all rebels; hackers, members of SR, those who use drugs, those who question the foundation of our laws and the people who rule over us, and those who fight against the norm. <br /><br />I just cannot condone that rebels turn on each other, steal from one another, and deceive one another. But my desires are only plausible in a perfect world. <br /><br />Fisher, keep doing what you&#039;re doing, you are a beneficial member of the underground, but I cannot support you in your actions against SR. Even if it is not personal, or specifically against SR, we are all rebels, and it strikes a blow to my heart that rebels would turn on each other.

				Well this thread sure is something unexpected... I must&#039;ve fucked up too as 77.4 bitcoins took a walk from my account. I think I might distantly remember using a wrong site once a long time ago before I even thought of buying anything. I do remember clearly thinking before depositing anything on my account that I should make a new account before I order but thought I&#039;d just make one quick order with a reliable seller. I guess I can&#039;t blame anything but my own lazyness, the product turned out to be bust and the seller canceled the order without me being aware and then a few days later the bitcoins that were given back to my account were mysteriously withdrawn, all the while I was ignorantly waiting for the product to arrive. And a day later it did arrive and the site outages started at the same time so I gathered with my friends to consume lots of pieces of paper while rolling our thumbs around and unable to get to SR to find out what the hell was going on. For a few days I thought the reason I wasn&#039;t able to access my account was because of the site outage but then I got the account back from mods. I was hoping I&#039;d at least get the coins back but the only thing that was awaiting me was 0.01btc. It sure was a shitty week, hopefully this one will be better.<br /><br />Moral of the story: don&#039;t be lazy and do go through that extra little bit of security just to be safe.

				I always use the ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion address to login, and yet I somehow got phished. The weird thing is the phisher managed to get the seller to cancel an order and two minutes later wiped me out and changed my password. Now I&#039;m locked out with no idea if the one order that is still in progress will go through.<br /><br />SR, add a pin to Bitcoin withdrawls, add SOMETHING. As much as the owner brags about being on top of security and making the site safe, this problem is widespread enough that security measures need to be taken to prevent it.

				does anyone else think that Silk is making his own phishing sites, and running scams himself? It seems funny to me that even when other phishers/ known scammers post ideas to stop this activity from going on, they are ignored. I am a scammer and a phisher! I think that there should be separate withdraw passwords or PINs and I think early finalize should be disabled (by requiring a waiting period). This would slow down people like me from stealing from people like you. I don&#039;t know why Silk hasn&#039;t implemented either of these things to protect you, so that leads me to conclude that Silk is participating in the phishing and scamming that is going on around here. If anyone has another reason that he hasn&#039;t implemented anything to stop people like me, I&#039;d love to hear it.

				funny thing happened today, maybe it is karma, maybe i was just right about Silk road being a scammer, you decide.&nbsp; I have a phishing site. I steal logins for Silk road. I think Silk road is a scammer himself. I logged on to one of many buyer accounts I have today, and saw that I had a bitcoin I had forgotten about. I transfered through a few other accounts I hold, while creating feedback for my next seller account (be warned), and after a few transfers, I logged out, but forgot which account I had left the bitcoin in. after trying a couple of my accounts this evening, I found the account that had it, but it had been.....withdrawn.... but not all at once, it took three seperate withdrawals over about 10 minutes. now that is weird, because I am 500% sure that I know the real address for Silk road, and I have only ever logged into one phishing site (mine).<br /><br />anyway, while I was typing this, I figured it all out. Turns out auto-withdrawal works, but it even withdraws bitcoins that are direct transfered to your username. that is fucked up! at least I figured out what happened, and someone who I phished out of a seller account ended up getting 1 BTC of their money back because I didn&#039;t disable auto-withdraw. small price to pay really, but I had fun typing this whole thing up.<br /><br />BTW Silk, if your reading this, You should replace the register link on the main site with a link to the new wiki, and give instructions on registering (with the real register link) in the wiki.<br /><br />also, I would be interested in giving my perspective on the wiki if you would be open to it. I don&#039;t have a lot of time to commit to it, but I could write a couple of articles that might help people avoid a bit of pain.

				You know, Fisher, you sound like a really lonely guy. Coming here to flaunt your phishing and stealing scams. You must have nothing better to do with your life than brag to the very people you steal from&nbsp; how you do it, and some wacked sense of justification.<br /><br />At the end of the day, YOU&#039;RE a THIEF. And thiefs and liars will get what&#039;s coming to them. Then, as if your pompous attitude couldn&#039;t be any uglier, you suggest that Silk Road is a scammer? The guy who trusts people on their word when they&#039;ve had people like YOURSELF rip them off in hacking scams?<br /><br />You&#039;re truly pathetic. No one wants to hear your opinion, no one wants to hear how you rip them off. It doesn&#039;t make you sound smart, it makes you look like what you are, a thief, a liar and an asshole.

				first off, people will be better able to avoid being scammed/phished by knowing how people do it.<br />second, I may be a thief and an asshole, but I haven&#039;t lied about anything<br /><br />last, Silk road COULD be part of the scammer/phisher problem<br /><br />lets list the things that Silk Road has done to protect buyers from scams and phishers<br /><br />1. create escrow (but not required).........<br /><br />am I missing a few?<br /><br />I as a scammer have suggested requiring escrow<br />I as a phisher have suggested secondary password for withdrawal<br />when I find more ways to stop people from being scammed/phished, I will openly suggest them, because I genuinely want this site to succeed, but stopping people from doing what I do is the only way for it to work.<br /><br />does anyone have an estimate of how much cold hard cash has been stolen by scammers/phishers in the past couple of months?<br />my esitmate is north of $50k (based on the reports in the forums, feedback about being scammed, and prices listed of the items they were scammed by.<br />so $50k x Silk road fee of 6.25% is $3125 that Silk has made from scams that have been reported or feedback to back it up.<br />now I have run scams that the feedback does not reflect, so lets add 25% to make up for that, and Silk Road has made about $4k for doing nothing.<br /><br />you guys should be DEMANDING that escrow be enforced and withdraw passwords be added. That is why I am here, and that is why I am not going anywhere any time soon.<br /><br />and lastly, if no one cares about what I have to say, why are you reading my posts?

				Well I started reading the post because I wanted to help a new person who may have been phished. When I first started here I lost my first large moneypak-btc order to a phisher who had compromised my security through probably hidden wiki or the like. I&#039;m still reading cause I&#039;m baked and interested. I&#039;m also curious if the OP ever received BTC from you. I am casually considering that the OP could be you, but I don&#039;t know you well enough to know if that is worth your time or effort. I don&#039;t condone your actions but it&#039;s still an interesting read and being phished for $200usd did teach me to be way more careful.
