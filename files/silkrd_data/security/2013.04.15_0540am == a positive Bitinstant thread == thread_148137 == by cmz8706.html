				I&#039;m seeing people cry &quot;scam&quot; and sh*t all over Bit Instant due to a litany of various complaints.<br />maybe they&#039;re 100% justified. I dunno. I&#039;m just seeing a lot of sh*t.<br /><br />so I figured on throwing in my .02 cents because why not.<br />me personally? I&#039;ve been using Bit Instant for Silk Road for like a year now. at least a dozen times. the longest they took to process an order was almost 3 days. that&#039;s happened once. the rest of the time they have always delivered in under 2 hours. usually before I get home when I&#039;m running errands.<br /><br />so like. I dunno. they&#039;ve been working just fine for me. especially given the rapid fluctuation in BT prices.<br />Bit Instant is (so far) batting a thousand (for me personally). if this a massive Ponzi scheme, at least they seem to be leaving me out of it *shrug*<br /><br />Slate even published this article:<br />http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2013/04/bitcoin_is_a_ponzi_scheme_the_internet_currency_will_collapse.html<br /><br />BT is one big Ponzi?<br />doesn&#039;t feel that way from where I&#039;m sitting.

				When did you use them last? If it&#039;s been within the last week or so, just consider yourself lucky, I guess.

				I used Bit Instant Friday afternoon (April 12).<br />the coins appeared in my wallet by the time I got home that same evening.<br /><br />so I&#039;m just super lucky?<br />or are other people blowing this crap out of proportion? it can&#039;t just be me and my dumb luck.

				I always use BitInstant and have never had a problem. I&#039;ve heard negative rumblings, but haven&#039;t bothered to delve into the details. Just what is supposedly so bad?

				Tell ya what...<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m pressing my luck (no whammies, no whammies, no whammies....&nbsp; stop!&quot;)<br />but I just used BitInstant again.&nbsp; I know everyone rags on &#039;em and says there&#039;s better options, but I&#039;ve yet to have any problems at all using it<br />(prolly shouldn&#039;t even being saying this, watch me get screwed now, heh)&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously though, it seems to be the most convenient option for me so far. <br />Until I can find a bank that I can use the drive-thru to make a deposit - that&#039;d be the shit, I tell ya<br />And NOT a BoA-&nbsp; but I guess that doesn&#039;t matter now anyway.<br /><br />But like I said - so far, so good.&nbsp; Used it half a dozen times or so now, with zero issues<br />I think the longest it took to show up is maybe 2 hours.<br /><br />Only thing that maybe annoyed&nbsp; me (kinda) is the chicky at Walmart saying to me today after I&nbsp; handed her the thing-<br />&quot;You&#039;ve sent money before this way, haven&#039;t you?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Me: &quot;No - not that one&quot; <br />Chicky : &quot;Oh, ok&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;Hehe... whateva biatch : )<br /><br /><br />(and boom - within the hour, as I was writing this, funds are posted to my account.&nbsp; Happy happy happy...)<br /><br />~vVv~<br />

				I switched to Bitfloor awhile ago once BI started having problems, but with them closing it left me no choice. Used BI today, and funds were literally in my account instantly. As I walked across the parking lot I checked my phone and boom, funds were there. I&#039;ve never had it that quick before. I guess they just got all out of whack with the price rally 2 weeks ago and are now back to normal once things started to settle down.
