				hey guys about an hour ago I attempted to transfer about 10 btc from my old bitfloor address and put it into my bitstamp account. On the bitstamp home page it showed the 10 BTC under &quot;incoming transactions&quot; and said it was waiting for 3 confirmations, whatever that means. I just checked my account again and the &quot;incoming transaction&quot; section is missing, and the BTC are not yet in my account. They are not in my bitfloor account either. I just looked up my bitstamp bitcoin address using blockchain.info and it shows no transactions. I&#039;m starting to get a little worried as 10 bitcoins is worth about 1200 dollars. Thats not pocket change

				Chill for a while, mrx - bitcoin transactions have been very slow on every venue for the past week from the reports I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; A couple of hours is nothing these days; I&#039;m betting it&#039;ll show up in bitstamp eventually. <br /><br />This is the part of BTC that annoys me and keeps me from doing any hobby-trading. Hard to handle the logistics as it stands now, with every transfer creating paranoia, no flexibility of movement because you&#039;re waiting for some server somewhere to catch up, and someone taking a few % of your money at each step along the way. It&#039;s well worth the pain to have unrestricted access to great drugs, but I&#039;m sure it takes some of the entertainment out of trading for fun and profit.

				thank you for your calming words sir or madam. You have been very helpful with many questions i have asked within the past few days. I think i have +1&#039;d you like 3 times already. It was just strange to me that the &quot;incoming transaction&quot; notification showed up almost instantly when I attempted to transfer the funds, but dissapeared like an hour later. Maybe the notification bar disappears when it&#039;s doing one of the &quot;3 network confirmations&quot; hopefully ill see the funds at some point during the next day. It&#039;s just very nerve wracking to have so much money money being transferred. I start to freak out at the slightest sign of trouble

				Since they&#039;re shutting down, Bitfloor is probably overloaded with withdrawals right now.&nbsp; Also, 1 hr isn&#039;t all that worrisome in bitcoin time.&nbsp; One time when I used them, it took about 45 minutes to show on blockchain.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Especially bitcoin.

				yes, I think I can do it. i dont know if im going to keep buying and selling bitcoins, but if this attempt goes well for me, then maybe i&#039;ll keep trading. It&#039;s one thing to make an honest attempt at the game and come up short, but it&#039;s another thing to have something happen that is completely out of your control, like your bitcoins getting stolen, or just simply disappearing, like what I thought just happened to me. I only put in enough money that I was willing to lose if things went sour, so if the market crashes again tomorrow and stays down for good, ill be upset, but i&#039;ll survive. That doesn&#039;t seem like its going to happen though. At least I hope not. I may act a little silly here on the forums but i&#039;m taking this pretty seriously. I understand the risks I am taking. Not to mention it&#039;s a pretty good feeling when you go from having 1000 dollars to 1200 in 24 hrs dohohoho. ;D

				everything is fine now. I can see the bitcoins in my bitstamp account. I think scout was right about bitfloor withdrawals taking much longer than normal because of bitfloor shutting down. It took like 12 hours for my coins to go from bitfloor to showing up on the blockchain. Phew! I&#039;m glad noone stole my bitcoins. If someone had, I would have been forced to use my liam neeson like skills to track them and kill them. Ain&#039;t nobody got time for that!

				Well, good luck with your investment, mrx. I&#039;ll be rooting for you - the more money you make, the more drugs the coins in my SR account will buy. It&#039;s all about me me me me me...
