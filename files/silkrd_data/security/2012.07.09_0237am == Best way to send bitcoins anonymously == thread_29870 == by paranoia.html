				Hi as my username suggests I&#039;m paranoid about bitcoin transactions.<br /><br />For the official bitcoin application what settings do people use? Is there a way to configure the bitcoin application to find peers over tor?<br /><br />I know when you send bitcoins it records your IP address and websites such as blockexplorer etc record the information.<br /><br />I want to know the best way to send people bitcoins anonymously as possible. VPN?

				Hey i remember being in your position not too long ago, 4 months to be exact.<br />The official program that uses bitcoins and is your wallet bascially is just another node (think of this as a bit torrent network then it will make alot more sense)<br />Yes all bitcoins are tracked in the way that they must be signed off for if your taking care of a prisoner. And these in turn generate the new coins. Its very weird how it all works, but it does trust me.<br />Also i found for personal useage i.e. mining actual coins using GPU or FPGA. The official application is perfect, but i would suggest move your stuff onto online wallets.<br />SR has a great facility on online wallets and http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide is where you should be looking at that before making your own wallet.<br />Basically, cause i&#039;m tripping on 25i, use online wallets i.e. SR ones, unless you are going to mine coins using FPGA or GPU then go ahead and use official program.<br />Also you get the added security of mtgox if there is a hardware failure but if your comp goes, so does your wallet.

				Aside from using a stolen paypal account bitcoin is the most anonymous form of payment available at present. Using a VPN will ensure that the IP address linked to the BTC cannot be linked to you (depending on what data your VPN provider stores).

				A good VPN that will not collect connection IP addresses and will mot share info with the feds and will not be a honeypot;<br /><br />IPREDATOR<br /><br />Based in Sweden, run by the piratebay guys, pretty damn safe.

				you don&#039;t need to send/receive bitcoin over tor.<br /><br />receiving bitcoin is already 100% anonymous, no matter whether you use tor or not.<br />sending bitcoin is sort of anonymous - every node in the system passes on the transactions it receives, so nobody knows if you were the one making the payment or just passed on that information, or so i heard.<br /><br />however, the bitcoin you send have a certain history and might be traceable back to whatever bank account you used to buy them.<br />so you should send your bitcoin multiple times through an eWallet like bitcoinfog or instawallet (they don&#039;t claim to anonymize your bitcoin but in blockexplorer it looks like they do, does anyone know more?) and only access that page with different tor IPs and cleared cookies. <br />there&#039;s a list of eWallet sites on the bitcoin wiki.
