				I&#039;m just wondering why so many people here recommend using Mt. Gox considering how much personal info they ask for. I mean, sure, they may be the easiest to use (except for those who, like me, do not have a color scanner) but I ain&#039;t giving out a copy of my license to ANYONE over the internet. I even fight doing it for employers (and have won, too)!

				I didn&#039;t know MT. Gox requires that much personal information! That really sucks. I hear they flag Tor exit nodes anyways so you have to do it on a public computer. Really unnecessary in my opinion. Unless you are using MT. Gox for it&#039;s actual purpose, I could see them requiring ID.

				I would never buy from them, why go through all that of having to transfer from them pay their fees etc etc? www.bitinstant,com is soo simple, there were just using in the usa but now they have other counrets added, all you pay is 3.99 for the zipzap free then 3.99% commission and u can pay several different ways, i suggest you stop messing with them and start using bitinstant, you dont have to start a account or anything,very simple. Or you could start a account at block chain which is easy as 123 also. If you did not know even though you have never sign up through block chain you can go there and put in your SR wallet account# and it will show you how many times you have added money etc.. If you would like some advice on much much easier ways PM me and i will be glade to help more. That MT.GOX just seems like a issue waiting to happend, And if you have ever went to this site while tor is connected and running through TOR you will have a issue. So i susggest u pull out from there and take my advice, many people will tell you the places i have listed are super easy.

				Mt Gox only REQUIRES photo ID if you&#039;re accessing their service via Tor or dealing with &gt; $10,000 USD of bitcoin/money transfers. It&#039;s an American company and therefor has to comply with US laws regarding finances. If you aren&#039;t moving 10k a month, they will bother you to &#039;verify&#039; your identity, but you don&#039;t have to do it.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re just looking to buy bitcoin - bitinstant is definitely the way to.. but that was already mentioned :P<br />.Hades.

An OTC vendor could be local, some bitcoin sites are setup in that manner, or global, using intentional payments to places like India or Brazil, who don&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />The only real way to ban OTC is to shut down international capital transfers or to subject the internet to such a degree of inspection that it effectively prevents regular trading. That&#039;s why I&#039;m in favor of it.<br /><br />All that may sound vague, but I promise if you visit the websites or IRCs that I&#039;d mentioned dozens of times on here, then you&#039;ll see it&#039;s relatively straight forward once you know how.<br /><br />In fact, you&#039;ll have serious advantage to anybody else who depends on &quot;exchange websites&quot;. Apart from reassuring familiarity of traditional institutions like online banks, they have nothing to offer.<br /><br />--<br /><br />LOL, a semi-related random thought occurs on the issue of useless banks. Everybody thinks online banks and that kind of thing is new, fresh, original. Boy are they in for a shock on a few levels. They don&#039;t have as much freedom as they imagine. Those online banks are all controlled by a directive to prevent a run on the banks and capital flight from the seriously shaky western banking institutions. You have absolutely no real control over your capital in reality, that statist monkeys have been at it again, they ought to be hung for their treasonous rationalizations.<br /><br />Bitcoin might look volatile, but... Just you wait! It may very well be safer on the net despite its flaws. I see no way for cryptocurrency but up. I see no way for western powers but down. We are approaching a dreadful calamity, almost everybody can sense it, can&#039;t you? What happens when quantitative easing no longer keeps a country&#039;s head above the water? Currently clever technocrats have managed to contain inflation in specific areas damaging to only certain sections of the population, but that is a stop gap measure, it cannot continue forever. <br /><br />I am thankful to DPR for reasons far beyond merely being almost certainly most innovative product distribution network in history. I think the darknet markets may be the *only markets* capable of keeping capitalism alive, because I don&#039;t think what is coming is going to be a &quot;slow steady decline&quot; as some have suggested. I think it will be absolutely catastrophic.<br /><br />There are powerful and compelling reasons to be saying this, because having studied world history among other things, there is no period I can think of in which an ascendant power has caused large interstate wars or suffered serious conflict. Conversely in every single period we have had such destruction, we have witnessed the demise of great powers, it is always the *decline* that causes conflict. Anybody who says we&#039;ll &quot;manage&quot; our way out of this is myopic. <br /><br />So I am quite pleased with myself. I think we are perfectly positioned for any civil conflict within the West. We shall take every advantage and lend support indirectly to every entity that leans on the state to hollow it out, merely by our existence. The principal purpose of cryptocurrencies will not be to allow for such markets as the Silk Road, it is to create a vampire tap on the tax base of world governments. The world is ultimately altered by the manipulation of capital structures, not public protests.<br /><br />So join PGP Club! It a genuine revolutionary act. You fellows are simply a couple of years ahead of the curve!<br /><br />/happythoughts
