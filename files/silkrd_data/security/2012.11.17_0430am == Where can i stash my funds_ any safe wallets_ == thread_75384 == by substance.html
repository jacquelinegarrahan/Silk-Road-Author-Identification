				You need to setup a bitcoin wallet on your computer. The software is on the official website. Once that is done ether withdraw the coins using the address in your account options(make sure to encrypt)&nbsp; &nbsp;Alternatively&nbsp; SR has setting that will send the bitcoins to the specified address whenever they shut down. Hope that helped.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There is a lot of reading about how to set up a good wallet on your PC.<br /><br />You&#039;ll have to make sure its a clean one, there are trojans and viruses that will steal your BTC like that.<br /><br />Also do some research on brainwallet.&nbsp; If you can do that, you should be golden.<br /><br />Stay safe,<br /><br />qg

				Stick em in Blockchain&nbsp; , but unless you have really alot of coins I would leave them in SR ,&nbsp; &nbsp;The logging out thing is something new but It doesn&#039;t seem to affect anythng when u come back in .. You probably just need 10mg of&nbsp; valium....&nbsp; ;)

				The blockchain wallet is really good and fast and they send you a backup for it in your email....I had a go with the bitcoin wallet but it takes ages to sync with the network... but unless you have 1000&#039;s of coins I wouldn&#039;t bother , but blockchain is very impressive...

				The safest method:<br /><br />Keep funds completely offline then you can use the paper wallet generator on bitaddress.org. Save the web page to a flash drive, boot into an Ubuntu live CD (you may have a trojan) then generate and print out the wallet and keep it somewhere safe. Save the public address and get coins sent to it whenever (like when using localbitcoins to buy for cash), use blockchain.info or similar to keep an eye on the balance.<br /><br />When you come to spend your coins you can import the private key into blockchain.info or the desktop client (both using TOR of course), then send them over to SR. This means you only have to trust SR and blockchain for 1 hour each, your computer can even have viruses on it and you still won&#039;t lose your coins.
