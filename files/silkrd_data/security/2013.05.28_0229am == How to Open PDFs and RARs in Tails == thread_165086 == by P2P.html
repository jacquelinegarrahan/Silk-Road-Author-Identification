				For some reason I am having a lot of trouble with this. I&#039;m trying to extract an RAR file I just downloaded into a folder I created in my persistent volume but it doesn&#039;t extract, for whatever reason.&nbsp; I&#039;m using the archive manager to try and extract the files, but it&#039;s simply not working. Also, I have no idea how to open the PDFs in the RAR. And I can&#039;t extract them to open in ScribusNG (which I think is the pdf reader in tails, correct?). Part of the reason I got tails was to buy some books off of SR, but now I&#039;m not even able to properly open them. Please let me know how to deal with this if you have experience with tails. I&#039;ve been searching on their site and forums and can&#039;t seem to find much.

The archive manager should work with RAR files by default. I just tested it with an example RAR file from here:<br /><br />https://code.google.com/p/suddendeath/downloads/detail?name=example.rar&amp;can=2&amp;q=<br /><br />Does that one open for you? If it does, maybe the RAR file you&#039;re trying to open is corrupt? Are you getting a CRC error or anything like that?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165086.msg1169591#msg1169591">Quote from: P2P on May 28, 2013, 02:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, I have no idea how to open the PDFs in the RAR.

If it&#039;s a CRC error or something along those lines, try downloading the RAR file again. If you still get the error, contact the vendor and have them re-post the file.<br />

				That&#039;s the thing, though, astor. There&#039;s no error message. I see the files in the rar in archive manager; they&#039;re there. I highlight them all and click extract. The loading bar comes up and everything, saying the extraction was successfully completed. I open the folder I extract to and NOTHING IS THERE. Is this normal? I don&#039;t know why this is happening but this defeats a large part of the purpose of using tails. <br /><br />

				Try this. Navigate to the folder with the RAR file. Right click on it -&gt; Extract here. The a folder should be created with the same name as the RAR file. The PDFs should be in it.<br />

				Are you using the newest version of tails, .18?&nbsp; <br /><br />Did the reboot work?&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you set up tails with a persistent volume or did you setup tails with persistence to certain files/folders ie saving settings for pidgin, iceweasel, keys etc...<br /><br />I would try using tails fresh with no persistence to see if something may happened with permissions or maybe you&#039;ve run out space wherever your keeping tails.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Have you tried some random RAR file as a test, like the one I linked above?<br /><br />We can at least figure out whether it&#039;s the archive manager or the archive.<br />

				Astor, I tried the RAR file you posted and extracted. I saw a file called &quot;compile&quot; or something of that nature, and then I saw a folder called &quot;images&quot; that had nothing in it (if it was supposed to have something in it, tell me). It&#039;s just strange because I&#039;m seeing the files in the RAR I want, but they won&#039;t extract. There&#039;s no error message or anything, everything runs like normal but then there&#039;s no files extracted to the folder in question when I check. I did the extract here function again and it even creates a folder with the same name as the RAR but there is nothing inside. <br /><br />Yes, my version of tails is up to date (0.18). Yes, it was a persistent volume. Even if it wasn&#039;t, the files would still show up; they&#039;d just be gone after I shut down. I definitely have not run out of space (32gb hard drive, empty, used for this, tails says 29.1gb available). And I don&#039;t have any permission password when I run tails, so I don&#039;t know.
