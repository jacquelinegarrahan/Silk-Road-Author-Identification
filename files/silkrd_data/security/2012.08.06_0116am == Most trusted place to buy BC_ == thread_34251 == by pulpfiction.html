				Open to suggestions. Especially if they miraculously allowed online debit payment. Curious what services you all think are the fastest?<br /><br />Thnx

				I used to use intersango by sending the money via bank transfer then the money would show up in my intersango account within 2 hours, but recently their account supposedly went under investigation and their customer service was terrible so I won&#039;t be using them any longer.<br /><br />Now I use Mt. Gox as it&#039;s cheaper and reliable.. like intersango you need to deposit money via bank transfer which can take 1-3 days but usually only takes a day.<br /><br />You can buy bitcoins through various people but vlad1m1r has had glowing recommendations, haven&#039;t used him myself but he seems very reliable and an honest guy.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				How anonymous do you need it to be? Have you looked into bit-instant? I haven&#039;t tried them but checking out their site it seems easy enough to drop in a convenience store or bank and do it.<br /><br />Anyone who has used bit-instant and can comment on their speed?

I&#039;m not a dealer, I don&#039;t sell shit here so I really am not worried about that. It&#039;s an electronic item that can be emailed. My primary concern is that I want it right now, tonight lol

				Fire up the ol&#039; GPU and mine &#039;em :-P<br />I dunno man, I&#039;m new here and somewhat new to bitcoins as well. Good luck though, hopefully you get what you&#039;re looking for.

				https://www.bitstamp.net/ seems a good place to buy BC.<br />They allow use of TOR and they are fast.
