				It&#039;s imperative that a comprehensive list of all the tor sites that were hosted by Freedom Hosting be compiled, so that none of us inadvertently visit these sites in case they are back up and very possibly compromised/turned into honeypots, etc.<br /><br />It has already been conjectured that Tormail, important as it was, was hosted by FH. Which other sites, please?<br /><br />Thank you all.<br /><br />goblin

				Torimages by the look of it (it&#039;s down atm). http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/<br /><br />anyone who was compromised by tormail and then went to the torimages site may well have been caught in the net.<br /><br />eta:&nbsp; tor images was used as an image hoster for a some people who posted pics in the forums.&nbsp; If you followed a link to look at a pic then you may have been caught as I&#039;m sure the kiddy fiddlers would have been using it too unfortunately.

				according to this guy, http://uscyberlabs.com/blog/2013/08/05/freedom-hosting-tor-website-list-tangodown/&nbsp; &nbsp;219 sites are offline.&nbsp; He lists the urls but not the site names so you&#039;ll need to do a find to see if your url of choice is on there.<br /><br />The other thing to remember is that some of these may have been down for other reasons so they may not all be FH sites

				Half of onion sites were hosted on FH. The list you want to compile will be very long, as you found out from the 219 addresses someone else compiled. As an indication of the size of FH, I got a new account a few weeks ago, and all of the MySQL databases I created were prepended with a number in the 5000s. Assuming these numbers are added sequentially, there were over 5000 FH accounts -- and the number of daily hits itha received was probably only rivaled by SR.<br /><br />What really sucks is they had just launched Onion Bank, which looked promising as an independent payment service (think of it as the anonymous PayPal of onionland), and now that appears to be scuttled.<br /><br />Also, they had a maintenance page up on Saturday, but now they are completely down again. That doesn&#039;t look good.<br />

				It&#039;s true, bitcoinfog&#039;s onion address does not appear among the 219. But maybe it&#039;s not a comprehensive list, and for that matter, tormail&#039;s address (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion) doesn&#039;t show up either, but we are told that they were in fact hosted by FH.&nbsp; <br /><br />Time to call in favors with the Yakuza.

				I used Bitcoin Fog this morning before I heard of all of this business and it seems to be operating as usual.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that that means anything really but I&#039;m crossing my fingers and hoping it&#039;s not compromised in some way since I&#039;ve already completed a withdrawal on there this morning.
