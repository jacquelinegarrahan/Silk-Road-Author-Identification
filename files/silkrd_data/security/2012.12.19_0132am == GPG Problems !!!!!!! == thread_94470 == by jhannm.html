				So I&#039;ve always had problems with gpg, and now I can&#039;t decrypt any messages it either says &quot;No open data&quot; or &quot;gpa has stopped working&quot; a few people have told me that I&#039;m not copy and pasting right and I need to make sure I&#039;m getting all the dashes in front and at the end of the message but I&#039;m doing that and it&#039;s still not working. What could be wrong I really need some help and I&#039;ve read and researched but can&#039;t seem to find an answer and most the info on the clearnet is hard to understand for someone like me who isn&#039;t very good with computers. Any help is GREATLY appreciated. Thanks.

				Here is a basic, simple guide I wrote, which should help you out if your using a Windows system (Gpg4win)<br />You could also use gpg4usb. It has a simple interface and is easier to use for beginners.<br /><br />1. Copy the Public Key of the person you want to send a message to.<br />2. Open a text editor, such as Notepad, and paste the Public Key. Name the file and save it to your desired location on your PC.<br />3. Open GPA (Gpg4win), click IMPORT, locate the file you just saved with the Public Key in it, and double click it. It will then show up in KEY MANAGER where it is stored for future use along with any other Public Keys you wish to keep.<br />4. Then click on CLIPBOARD, the 2nd icon in from the right at the top of the page. Type the message you wish to send to the recipient and then click ENCRYPT. Click on the Public Key of the person your sending the message to (should now be highlighted), then click OK at the bottom.<br />5. Then copy the encrypted message and paste it in a PM to the recipient and send it,<br />6. REMEMBER - Include your Own Public Key in this message if you wish to receive an encrypted response from the recipient. You can find this by RIGHT-CLICKING your key in KEY MANAGER, then copy/pasting it. :)

				To decrypt, copy and paste the encrypted message you received into the CLIP BOARD in GPA. Click on DECRYPT, enter your Private Key and the message is then able to be read.

Private Keys are kept private for obvious reasons and ARE NOT kept with the Public Keys you have in the Key Manager.

				So I uninstalled gpa and reinstalled it, then I was able to decrypt a message just fine but after the first one it won&#039;t decrypt any more messages. I deleted one of the keys in key manager and now only have one. I know my public and private keys work because I just decrypted a message but now it won&#039;t decrypt any more. This is really frustrating I really need some help. Thanks guys. I deleted second key and was able to decrypt one message after that so I know the key I have on there is good.

				Delete all the keys from your Key Manager and start fresh. Create a new Public Key for yourself. If that doesn&#039;t work, it could perhaps be an issue with your P.C. What version of Windows are you running?

				I&#039;ll take a stab at this: yes, you can import your old private key.&nbsp; Provided you have it on disk somewhere.&nbsp; Did you think to save it?&nbsp; Or know where GPG4WIN (apparently what you were using) would store it?<br /><br />The GPG application generally stores it in the user&#039;s home directory under a &quot;.gnupg&quot; folder.&nbsp; Since GPG4WIN is a port of GPG for Windows, I assume it would leave fundamental things like that alone and put it in your C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.gnupg directory.&nbsp; It should be labeled &quot;secring.gpg&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s your secret keychain.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give it out or anything.&nbsp; Just import it.<br /><br />Your public keys (including imported ones) should be in the same location in the file &quot;pubring.gpg&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think your private key should show up in your key manager.&nbsp; But when you say &quot;key manager,&quot; I don&#039;t even know what you&#039;re talking about, frankly.&nbsp; I tend to avoid all the high-level simplifications that Ubuntu and &quot;friendly&quot; Linux distros like it provide, so that&#039;s about all the help I&#039;m going to be (whether it&#039;s of help or not, lol).&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned more about computers struggling to use Linux than I ever learned in really any other way.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t always been fun though...<br /><br />Anyway, remember: a public key is used to encrypt for the corresponding private key.&nbsp; You probably don&#039;t want your SECRET KEY showing up in your PUBLIC KEY ring, right?&nbsp; I mean unless you add your own public key to it or something.<br /><br />Good luck.

Remember that there are two panes: the editor pane on the left, the key pane on the right. <br /><br />Keys that you generate will show up in the GPG4USB right-hand pane with the following format. First you&#039;ll see a little checkbox, then a pair of gold/silver keys, then the username and finally the email address on the key (if any). <br /><br />Are you trying to tell me that you&#039;re not seeing the key that you generated in the right hand pane? <br /><br />If you want to import one of your keys from GPG4WIN, you&#039;ll have to import your *private* key, if you want to be able to decrypt any messages. (Alternatively, you can import both your public and private keyrings.) <br /><br />NC<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes that&#039;s what I&#039;m saying, the key after I generated a key it didn&#039;t show up in the right hand panel like it does in the tutorial. I just got a new laptop so I&#039;m going to try it again and see what happens hopefully it was an issue with my old pc.
