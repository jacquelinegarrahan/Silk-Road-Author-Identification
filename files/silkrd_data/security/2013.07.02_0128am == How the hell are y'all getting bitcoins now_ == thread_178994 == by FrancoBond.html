				In the past I&#039;ve gone through aurumxchange, bitinstant, bitcopia, and a couple of coin vendors on the road, all of which are MIA right now. What the fuck is going on? I can&#039;t even find anybody that can process an order for me. This feels to me like the beginning of the end of the road. It&#039;s so difficult to get coins now. I was thinking of trying blueskytraders or BTCKing next, but they are both &quot;waiting for their accounts to be funded&quot;.... it never used to be this hard. <br /><br />Anyway, how is everyone getting their bitcoins nowadays? I&#039;m at a loss for options.

				it&#039;s pretty similar to sr, you place an order and the coins are in escrow. seller marks payment received when they get it and then release coins from escrow into your wallet there. the multiple wallet bullshit is for your security you know.

BTC prices are tanking bad and there are a large number of people out there that would lose money selling right now. Let the price come up and you will get all the bitcoin you want. People just aren&#039;t going to sell for a loss. I find it highly suspicious that a lot of these resellers suddenly have technical problems when the price tanks. Could be a coincidence. I don&#039;t think that is the case with BST. I think they are just overwhelmed. Going to try to buy $1000 off them today and see what happens. I&#039;m almost worried to buy right now though because the price has gone lower than I have seen in months. Not sure if we have hit bottom yet.

				local bitcoins &gt; wallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; sr. that&#039;s the long safer way of doing it. or you can send straight here. you don&#039;t really need to get another wallet but if you want easy to use then blockchain.info is fine.

				I like SR&#039;s &quot;Jumbomonkeybiscuit&quot; but he is 10% also. I think the US Gov. is doing a pretty good job of making it so you have to use an anonymous seller if you want to be an anonymous buyer. And the sellers are probably being/going to be hunted. They probably deserve at least 5% and maybe even 10. If you think 10 is too much, you can always offer 9% and take their business :-)

				Used localcoins today. Tried a few local guys and no one responded, probably working or whatever. Guy popped up with a perfect transaction record doing BoA transfers and the coins were priced just a little above market, not bad at all. Went and made a deposit, confirmed it, and the coins were released from escrow about 60 seconds later at most. Easiest BTC transaction I have ever made. Even though he was a little above market, it wasn&#039;t anywhere close to 10%. Somewhere around 4 or 5. I would recommend this service if you choose a supplier wisely and don&#039;t have an issue walking into a BoA.

				Hey everyone, I posted this on the Silk Road Reddit page, I figured it would be relevant here too:<br /><br />I really don&#039;t want this to sound like spam, but if you&#039;re wondering where to buy, I just had success with a new service at bitcoin-brokers.org, it was just as easy as Blue Sky (cash deposit @ bank)... Was really nervous using a new method but I had my BTC in my wallet within hours. Anyway, hopefully that helps at least a couple of you

The key is to look during normal banking hours. The listing pop up and you gotta act fast because they tend to sell out quick.

				i use localbitcoins. theres even a guy whos got Regions bank deposits, along with citibank, bank of america, and wells fargo. yeah the percentage is around 10% but going thru the drive thru at the bank is so convenient. i dont mind the fee.<br /><br />and like someone said before vanilla reload cards are nice too. walgreens, 7/11, etc sells those and you redeem it with a vendor on localbitcoins.

				Blue Sky Traders currently has this message up on their website:<br />&quot;We are currently closed for new trades.<br /><br />We&#039;ll reopen when we clear up our inventory flow issues. We&#039;ll post it right here when that happens.<br /><br />We are very hopeful that it will be tomorrow, but we&#039;re very wary of making such promises.<br />Please refrain from placing orders until we announce availability here on this page. We will take orders only if we have ready inventory, and the Early Order system must now join the others in the extinct systems category. It has ended up causing more issues with customer service than it ever did improving it.<br /><br />We will try, but may not be able to personally respond to all the email received.<br /><br />Thanks for your continued patience and support!&quot;<br /><br />

				Bitstamp is still an option. It&#039;s an exchange as opposed to an individual seller. I don&#039;t believe they&#039;re terribly anonymous with the account (I don&#039;t recall the registration process) but moving your bits shouldn&#039;t be a new task for an SR buyer.

				for you people who have done local meetups from localbitcoins.. did you buy from people with feedback? there&#039;s a guy nearby selling at $5 under spot, but he has no feedback.. other people around my area do not have feedback as well. i&#039;d like to purchase some coins, but im stil a bit skeptical at this point.

You have to worry they will grab your cash and run, but, I don&#039;t think that is at all common. Meet in a public place and do a small trade to get to know the seller. You can set up more than one trade and make sure the first one works before moving on to a larger one. The coins go into your Local wallet quickly and there is a confirmation code that the seller will only know if they released the coins to you. Be sure they &quot;funded&quot; the transaction at least an hour in advance so you know they really have the coins and can release them quickly when you meet.<br /><br />If you do a deal online thru a bank or cash in the mail or whatever, feedback/reputation is crucial (since you will not have any as a Local newbie) and will likely have to send your part first. There are escrow protection options and vendors with solid reputations. You just have to be careful who you choose.

				When you use BOA to send money to Blue sky or a localbitcoin seller do you need to have an account at the branch.&nbsp; The last time I went into a BOA they would not even change money for me w/out an account.&nbsp; I assume a valid DL or other id is necessary?<br />thanks

				@upthera - No identification is required.&nbsp; Go in and ask for an out of state deposit form.&nbsp; BoA won&#039;t ask for your name or any of your information.&nbsp; BST will give you the information necessary to complete the form and all you do is fill out the form, give the teller your cash, and wait for the BTC to show up.

				I always tell people to use bitcoin-otc..... I&#039;ve found some people on there who can do up to $20,000-40,000 in bitcoins per week easily with just a bank deposit or whatever method you want to use. I have even done cash-in-mail for amounts a little less than 5 digits. Find trusted people, none of your information ever gets recorded, etc, very easy.
