				- You can top up your account with just enough to make your purchase. Or a little extra, in case value drops :)<br />- You won&#039;t get charged for having the account, you do pay a small fee but the vendors mostly incorporate that in their price.<br />- Depends on the method you use. There are instant bitcoin sites, or it could take up to a week. <br />- That also depends on the method you use to acquire coins. If you buy with cash, or cash-cards it won&#039;t be connected obviously. If you buy through a bitcoin site f.e. Intersango.com it does get connected to your bank account. (that&#039;s only to Intersango tho) If you want to be safe you can send your coins through a tumbler like bitcoinfog (they do take a little fee) and then to your Silk Road account. <br />- Learn GPG/PGP?

				Well you don&#039;t actually &#039;buy&#039; them for cash, you send cash through the mail to a vendor who sells bitcoins for cash :)<br /><br />Where are you from? If you&#039;re from Europe you could send them to Vlad1m1r, he is a trustworthy guy. <br /><br />Intersango depends from time to time, I&#039;ve had it take almost 3 weeks, but it also happened within 2-3 days.

				check out &quot;bitinstant&quot; website. I am not sure what they are able to do as far as non-usa folks, but it may just all be the same.<br /><br />You want to be able to remain as anon as possible. If you can find a reliable vendor to sell you coins for cash then you are all set.<br /><br />If you are still having issues, pm me I may be able to help point you in a more direct direction.<br /><br />cheers!<br />

				Thanks alot guys&nbsp; :). Just one more question lol ::)&nbsp; -- Apparently it can take ages for funds to appear in your intersango account!!&nbsp; <br />Is it quicker to transfer money directly from your bank account into an Mtgox account??<br />And is this classed as an international bank transfer?

				Quick answers are:<br /><br />No.<br />Yes. and Yes.<br /><br />With the objective of trying to remain anon, I wouldnt move anything to Mt.Gox either.<br /><br /><br />Last legit tranfers involving Mt.Gox took 7 or 8 days.<br /><br />Have you looked into Bitinstant?

				The first time I put money into my SR account, I used a MoneyPak to Bitcoin exchange within SR. I&#039;m not saying this is the best or most reliable way, but since I&#039;m a horrible noob, I figured it would be more anonymous than myself trying to fail at being undetected. <br /><br />Go to a store that sales Green Dot MoneyPaks with the amount of cash you want to deposits, be generous since the prices fluctuate quite a bit and vendors will charge a fee. The salesclerk will give the card back with an activation code, which is the same as the scratch off code on the back of the card. *Make sure you get a card with a scratch off on the back, and not a pre-paid debit card*<br /><br />Just in case this needs to be said, don&#039;t activate the card. It&#039;s temporary and does not have personal information attached until it is activated, at which point they send a &quot;permanent card&quot;.<br /><br />The hard part is finding a vendor you can trust, because really, you&#039;re taking a chance that they don&#039;t just run off with your money. Do your research, and research very well. I, personally, used Sugar Mama and had no problems whatsoever with this vendor. Bit coins within 24 hours, but just because one transaction goes well, doesn&#039;t guarantee a future transaction. Like I said, research, research research.<br /><br />If all goes accordingly with the vendor of your choosing, they will deposit bit coins directly into your SR account. I would advise lurking forums and learning as much as you can before placing an order, make sure to check out Rumor Mill vendor threads.<br /><br />Hope this helps, good luck and welcome!<br /><br />

				To the thread starter, that&#039;s not a stupid question. Hell I was trying to purchase bitcoins through my debit card right into my SR wallet lol. I use bitinstant.com every time. It&#039;s easy as hell. Pretty much self explanatory once you get to the homepage. Then after you&#039;re set up they give you easy instructions on what to do.
