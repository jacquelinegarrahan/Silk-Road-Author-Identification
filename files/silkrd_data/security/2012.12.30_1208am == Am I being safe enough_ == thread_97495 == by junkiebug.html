				Just want to know what you guys think. I have all my tor/pgp/etc. files stored on an encrypted usb. I have also disabled my paging (swap) file. However, I haven&#039;t quite figured out liberte and I&#039;m running on windows 7. Is this safe enough? Should I maybe encrypt my entire system partition?

				Look into Tails I couldn&#039;t figure out Liberte and Tails is pretty cool and I think you can use Truecrypt with it.

				+1 for Tails. There are a lot of threads on the forum with people having problems with Liberte.<br /><br />And if you can fully encrypt your hard drive, definitely do that.<br />

				I would also reccommend not installing Java, Flash Player or Adobe Reader to name a few.<br />A bunch of trojans use vulnerabilities in these add on programs to install onto your computer without your knowing.<br /><br />As soon as you get a keylogging trojan on your PC you are pretty much screwed.

				true, but even having these installed poses a risk if for instance browsing the clearnet with a borwser that does not block such addons ...<br />

That&#039;s the point of selecting 3 random nodes in the network. Tails doesn&#039;t make you more anonymous on the Tor network. It only prevents you from writing stuff to your hard drive. Full disk encryption offers a similar level of security, but that has nothing to do with anonymity.
