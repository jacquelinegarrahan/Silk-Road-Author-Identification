				Yeah I&#039;ve been to Topix before and it&#039;s the same shit. I guess the DEA &amp; all don&#039;t even bother to bust them because they are just too retarded. It&#039;s like busting a dude dealing behind a police station.

				When I finish my SR book project, Topix will have pride of place as an example of how dreadful a contractless black market can be. I think one must remember that traditional LE agents have been faced with the citizens of Topix on a daily basis and think all drug consumers are like this. Doesn&#039;t exactly paint racing stripes on their operations, that&#039;s what happens when you get fed a biased sample on a daily basis.

				Pine you can&#039;t seriously call Topix a member of the SR family. At the most it&#039;s the spunk in the condom that was thrown away some years before SR was conceived. :P

Nobody knows how to use encryption or even thinks it matters. <br /><br />The seriously awful Topix method is to hand out a ton of free samples to all the craving junkies who are typically other dealers who will leave you a bad review no matter how awesome the product is. They are so dumb if your Tor IP reports you in Europe and you&#039;re selling in US they accuse you of scamming not knowing wtf tor is. &quot;Yeah right buddy, your IP is in Scandanavia LooOL you&#039;re a scammer LooOl I&#039;m so smrt&quot;. They also only want to pay via Paypal or in person. lol in person.<br /><br />A bunch of regs there run private boards but they&#039;re typically drug addicted chavs who write eye searing threads like &quot;IYAGIMMA TE GUBNAH FANCY THE COLA AND CHARLIE BLIMEYHELL&quot; and always log on incredibly wasted jeapordizing everything. Enjoy<br /><br />Maybe 10% of the dealers there use vac seal, rest are shipping weed in plastic bags covered in tape. Yes. It&#039;s that retarded

				this reminds me of the pill dealer from topix that tried coming on here making product offers without a vendors account and asking for paypal and WU.<br /><br />and than, when his thread got locked he thought that he could get away with just starting another one.<br />He was one of the biggest tards I have seen pop up on this forum and he should be the poster child for topix<br /><br />thanks for the laugh guys

				If you look at films like TopGun and Breakfast Club it explains a lot. You see in TopGun when Tom Cruise says his father was shot down and it wasn&#039;t explained, that&#039;s actually subtext for &quot;My father went down my pants shot his load and my social worker never explained it to me&quot;.<br /><br />Allllll in the subtext people....
