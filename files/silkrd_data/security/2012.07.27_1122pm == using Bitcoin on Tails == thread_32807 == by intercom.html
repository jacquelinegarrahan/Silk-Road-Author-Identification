				I am using Tails. As far as I know, bitcoin the application is unavailable as a package and the persistance required would simply problematic for this distro.<br /><br />I have never used bitcoin so I do not have an address. Could I simply use an address generated by, say, torwallet or instawallet to receive bitcoins? The address would be first vector point before being quickly transfered out on a long circuitous route that may or may not end at SR. <br /><br />Thoughts?

				I haven&#039;t used Tails yet, but I do plan to compare it to other options that are available soon enough. <br /><br />I think the primary issue would be running it at all, I believe the BTC wallet program takes a bit of time to integrate itself with the network. I have no idea if that would initiate properly on Tails, but you would most likely have to reestablish bitcoin every time you use Tails. This may or may not be an issue depending on how long it takes. <br /><br />Just download the bitcoin wallet and give it a test run to see how long it will take to integrate itself with the network, shut down, and then restart to see if you have to redo the process. If you&#039;re not leaving your computer up then it should be fine, just make sure you transfer the BTC out of the address before closing Tails.

				thanks<br /><br />bitcoin installs &amp; runs from my usb drive via the script, but unfortunately data is not being saved to the data folder.<br /><br />is this script correct?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />&#039;/media/XXXX/bitcoin-0.6.3-linux/bin/32/bitcoin-qt&#039;<br />-datadir=/media/XXXX/bitcoin-0.6.3-linux/data<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />/media/XXXX is where my usb is mounted. <br /><br />When the bitcoin application syncs with the network, I eventually run out of space and receive an error message; I am running the tails live dvd + a 16gb thumbdrive for encrypted storage because my computer cannot boot from USB, so it seems like that data is being saved into RAM instead of the USB drive.

				since the script does not seem to work and I have not been able to install the electrum client, I just want to clarify: is it possible to simply transfer bitcoins to an address generated by torwallet or instawallet (bitinstant &gt; email/catapult &gt; torwallet)?

				it&#039;s not neccesary to download the btc client on tails. you can use online wallets.<br /><br />Send the coins from the online exchange of your choice (I love bitfloor) to another online wallet like instawallet then maybe to another online wallet of your choosing, then to your SR wallet. be sure to remember each address you use and encrypt with gedit and PGP whenever possible and use Tor when possible.

				I use tails and the original bitcoin client, but not on the same computer.&nbsp; I&#039;d think using the bitcoin client on Tails would be a big hassle; wouldn&#039;t you have to download the blockchain, (through tor), every time you opened up tails before you could use your walllet?&nbsp; In addition to the bitcoin client I use an online wallet called Strongcoin which seems to work out pretty well so far.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple to use.&nbsp; A small fee is charged for each transaction which is deducted from your bitcoin balance.,

				Like another poster said, no need for bitcoin wallet software. You can fund your SR account only having to register a bitcoinfog account and most importantly without ever having to not use tor.<br /><br />First you want to go to bitcoinfog and register an account. ( http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ ). Once you&#039;ve registered, take your deposit address down. Then browse&nbsp; to bitinstant, make an order to fund a bitcoin address with moneygram (7-11). It will ask what address you want to fund, copy and paste your deposit address from bitcoinfog. <br /><br />Go to 7-11 or wherever, and send the moneygram. Let your deposit sit for a few days so that it&#039;s properly laundered. Then transfer it to your SR account.<br /><br />You&#039;ve now funded your SR account properly, without ever having NOT used TOR, and letting your bitcoins get properly laundered before deposit.<br /><br />Easy peasy.

It will ask what address you want to fund, copy and paste your deposit address from bitcoinfog. <br /><br />Go to 7-11 or wherever, and send the moneygram. Let your deposit sit for a few days so that it&#039;s properly laundered. Then transfer it to your SR account.<br /><br />You&#039;ve now funded your SR account properly, without ever having NOT used TOR, and letting your bitcoins get properly laundered before deposit.<br /><br />Easy peasy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmmm.......that does sound easy peasy!!&nbsp; thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course! Anytime.

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;d prefer to have my bitcoins stored on a USB that can be used with tails.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s like holding on to your money, you don&#039;t want someone else (ie; an online wallet) holding onto your coins.<br /><br /><br />I would like to find away to get BTC working on tails with USB..&nbsp; I idea is to find away to save the block chain and BTC wallet to the encrypted USB drive with tails. You wont have to download the blockchain every time - as it SHOULD be saaved to the USB drive.<br /><br />If anyone can get&nbsp; vlad1m1r&#039;s guide to work - as in: not save block chain and wallet to /home on tails, but save it to the USB drive data folder.<br /><br />Thanks if anyone can help!
