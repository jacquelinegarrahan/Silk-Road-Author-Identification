				When I email a picture from my phone to my computer how safe is that Image I am sending?

				I believe imgur scrubs exif data from what I know, don&#039;t quote me on this though. Check it yourself by uploading a picture and seeing if the exif data is kept intact.<br /><br />At the minimum I believe your phone would say what model phone it was taken on. You could always scrub the exif data yourself using gimp. Just open the image and save it, unchecking the keep exif box.

				Save the image as a PNG, no more exif data. Upload to an onion image host.

				It&#039;s as simple as open the image, take a screenshot of it, and then delete the original.

				Thanks for your help guys! I am on a Mac though, what the best program I can get to do it from my mac? <br /><br />My computer came with Photoshop installed on it ( I bought it from a friend of mine) and when I had to reformat I lost alll my programs :( so Now I am having the hardest time trying to find alternatives!

It&#039;s the screen shot utility in Mac OSx.<br /><br />⌘ + ⇧ + 4&nbsp; to select an area to capture. <br />Load the image in an image viewer and just screenshot the picture. Quick and easy.

				You&#039;re also talking about email it to yourself. Besides the obvious exif data, the image will be available for data mining at the email ISP. And I&#039;m quite sure ISPs mine for illegals, although they&#039;re probably focused more on CP and terrorism shit than drugs. But still, encrypt that shit first, then email it. Or just USB transfer it.

				Well, if you&#039;re really paranoid there&#039;s also this to consider:<br />https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/04/digital_cameras.html<br /><br />And you can try to remove the &quot;fingerprint&quot; by altering the image i.e. like this:<br />http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Selective_Gaussian_Blur/<br /><br />But imho that&#039;s not really necessary, especially if it&#039;s just one pic.

				I would recommend using Irfanview, it can scrub exif data and has a lot of extra information about your image.<br />Imgur as an image host will also scrub any exif data, at least for the average viewer.<br /><br />For the paranoid:<br />Imgur may keep an original copy/record of your image that includes original exif data. Clean exif data before using imgur.<br />Your phone may have an app that stores your pictures with third parties that you aren&#039;t aware of. After all the issues with apps stealing contact lists and logging data/keystrokes this becomes an issue.
