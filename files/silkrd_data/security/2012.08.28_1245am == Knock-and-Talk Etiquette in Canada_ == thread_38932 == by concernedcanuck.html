				So I had a tiny (&lt;1g) order from a domestic vendor, who I am 99.9% sure has been busted. Being a domestic customer, if my name/address is found at the crime scene, I have to assume police will want to act on this information. My house/pc has been cleaned, and I have a number of a lawyer just in case. However, I have no idea how to actually act if cops show up at my door. <br /><br />Do I just tell them to f**k off if they don&#039;t have a warrant? Won&#039;t this only add to their suspicion? Should I invite them in, offer a cup of tea and nicely explain I have no idea why my information was there and that I don&#039;t want to discuss the matter further out of fear of accidentally incriminating myself?<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m going to talk to a lawyer ASAP to get his opinion (I will post his opinion here for y&#039;all when I get it), but I would love to hear from Canadians who have faced similar situations. <br /><br />

				The police are nor going to care about your purchase. I would be very very very surprised if they ever contacted you. Yes your name may go down in a file some where, but I wouldn&#039;t worry about it unless there is something more worthwhile to make them come look at you...

				While not specific to canada, I&#039;m sure much of the same applies. FlexYourRights.org, search for the YouTube chan, it walks you through how to act.

				Nothing wrong with knowing your rights, but thank Buddha for living in Canada where there are lax drug laws. I don&#039;t think you will have any problems.
