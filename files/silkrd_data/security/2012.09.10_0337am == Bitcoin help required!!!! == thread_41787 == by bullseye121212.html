				Greetings,<br />im new to SR community and was wondering if you guys could help me better understand how bitcoins work. I need bitcoins as soon as possible and i realized how getting bitcoins through another website and than mtgox can be a lengthy process. could someone walk me through a process by which i could get bitcoins as soon as possible? Also do you get bitcoins through credit/debit cards?<br />pls assist<br />thank you!

				u can use several methods for acquiering coins.. the fastest in my opinion is MoneyPak greendot cards (something like a debit card) and Bitinstant.com using moneygram and fake info to wire money to my bitcoin address

				yea on bitinstant u have the option to send it to a email or. to a bitcoin addres or Mt.Gox account or whatever...<br /><br />if u want to cut corners and got money to throw up .. than a TRUSTED MP vendor like SUGAR MOMMA or SMARTCOIN <br />will do the trick.. i use bitinstant now, because i blew alot of money on the moneypaks all day long...<br />plus da scams are high and with vendors faking alot of shit here..<br /><br />if u go to bitinstant they got a walk through how to use it..<br /><br />i personally use the WALMART LOCATION to my BITCOIN ADDY.. i send it straight to my SR ADDY..<br />i hear SR .. flips the coin in here so its like a BITFOG COIN SERVICE where they wipe it and switch it for anonymous use

				i guess i smoke too much bud.. but yea. i guess im just paranoid.. but yea the forums are huge so whos to say who&#039;s who&nbsp; ? <br />know what&#039; i mean ?<br /><br />when i say cops i also mean the :<br /><br />Informants<br />1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything.<br />2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data).<br />3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend.<br />4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment.

				Is Mt.Gox the preferred bitcoin exchange service these days?&nbsp; Is it the same as getting a bitcoin addy?&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read programs such as Bitcoin-qt and Multibit serve different purposes than Mt.Gox.&nbsp; Do you need both Mt.Gox and such a program to get started.<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this whole deal&nbsp; and a little confused as well...looking to jump in and swim around here on the SR as efficiently and as soon as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; And ya I&#039;m using google and researching but figured I&#039;d see what the SR vets have to say about it as all info is appreciated.&nbsp; Thx in advance.

				if at all possible, stay away from mt.gox. they are not SR friendly. there are many ways to buy and sell btc. take your time, do your research, and find what works best for you. dont try to rush in, thats how mistakes are made. you will feel a lot better about it if you take the time to learn it for yourself rather than following some questionable route to obtaining btc.

				You know this is all actually really good advice<br />ever since i discovered SR i&#039;ve been trying to get stuff ASAP but now i can see how crucial it is to take your time and do the research<br />cant let impatience get the better of me, but still you gotta admit that when you see that webpage... you want to jump right in lol
