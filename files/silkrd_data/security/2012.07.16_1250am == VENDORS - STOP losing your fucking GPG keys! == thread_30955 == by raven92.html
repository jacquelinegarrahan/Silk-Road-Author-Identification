				Oh wow. I was originally under the impression that changing it would be benefitial... but from a buyer&#039;s perspective this is absolutely correct!<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the option to sign keys on gedit... but how do you verify that it is signed?

In case your security is compromised in the future, all past messages will automatically become unreadable after the expiration date. However, there is a proper way to do that. As OP pointed out, you should sign a message with your current (old) key stating that you&#039;re switching keys. You should also sign your new private key with the old key. This creates a chain of trust between them. Obviously a problem here is that people forget about the expiration date, and once that date has passed, no chain of trust can be established between the keys.
