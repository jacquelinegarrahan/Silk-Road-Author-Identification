				Okay, if this thread is somewhere else, well, bite me. I&#039;m starting this question anew.<br /><br />So, I go to transfer frunds from Dwolla to Mt. Gox via their lovely &#039;automated&#039; Add Funds link to my Account number right? Well, usually, it simply defaults to the Balance I have existing in my Dwolla account. HOWEVER, today, when I click on this automated link, it gives me an OPTION to take funds from my DWOLLA balance, or from the bank account which I have linked.&nbsp; Now, again, call me fucking crazy. But this is now making me EXTREMELY paranoid. <br /><br />When/why the hell is that even possible for Mt Gox to bypass Dwolla balance, and try and take funds directly from my bank account?<br /><br />WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Oh, and guess what else. Dwolla&#039;s &quot;Contact Us&#039; - &quot;help&quot;,&nbsp; ALL of those links are completely gone. As in, DO NOT EXIST.

				Well, I just checked and I see the option too to have it come from my bank account rather than directly from my Dwolla balance.&nbsp; However, the page with that information is a Dwolla page, just like before, not a Mt. Gox one.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t go through with the transfer, but I have a feeling it would work just the same as doing the transfer from you bank account first manually.&nbsp; While it&#039;s certainly possible that Dwolla has been hacked or they&#039;re passing more information along to Mt. Gox, I kind of doubt it.&nbsp; They&#039;re just trying to make sending funds take fewer steps.<br /><br />And the &quot;Contact Us&quot; and &quot;Help&quot; links are back down on the bottom of the Dwolla page, but go straight to their home page, so looks like in their update process they broke some links.&nbsp; You could always try e-mailing them at support at dwolla dot org or calling them at 515.280.1000

				I suggest everyone using bank account transfers for bitcoin purchase to look for new ways.<br />You can WU a Liberty Reserve exchanger and move your LR into a tradehill/mt.gox btc exchanger and have btc in under 24 hours.&nbsp; Of course you are lookking at fees you wouldnt pay thru Dwolla but it increases your cafety 80%+.&nbsp; Last time I did this it was like 10$ fee for the LR exchanger and then how ever much the WU fee is to the LR exchanger of your choice. LibertyReserve website has a list of their approved LR exchangers, find one that fits you. <br />Last time I did this I had bitcoins in SR in less than 18hours. <br /><br />Also sidenote never move btc directly from your btc client or directly from your btc exchanger.
