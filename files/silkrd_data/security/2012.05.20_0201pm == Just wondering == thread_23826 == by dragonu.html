				Hi dragonu,<br /><br />Welcome to Silk Road, <br /><br />I&#039;ve been having rather heated discussion about this! If you have your Tor browser / GPG software / Bitcoin Wallet on an encrypted USB stick it will be near impossible for law enforcement to recover the deleted data if they seize the stick by itself. Good thinking on switching off the RAM SWAP although it won&#039;t protect you from all forms of the cold boot attack. I would suggest you encrypt your OS too, to reduce the risk of any analysis of your temporary files.<br /><br />Provided you stick to using the Tor hidden services i.e don&#039;t use your Tor Browser to access any regular websites then all your ISP will be able to tell is that your connection is encrypted - this may be enough to cause suspicion if you live in a very remote area with very few Tor users but the risk of any analysis of your traffic proving you visited a specific site like Silk Road are virtually nil.<br /><br />Having done what you can to mitigate the technological risks, there are certain risks involved in buying Bitcoins by non anonymous methods e.g by wire transfer and naturally receiving contraband at your home address has its share of risks too!<br /><br />Why not have a read of some of threads on here and come back if you have any questions?<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=23826.msg249922#msg249922">Quote from: dragonu on May 20, 2012, 02:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I kept reading about going library, encrypting HDD etc.<br />I was just wondering as a buyer what do I actually need to hide...It doesn&#039;t really make sense...<br /><br />If i keep TOR and a bunch of notepads with useful links on a encrypted USB Memory stick using TrueCrypt and i switch off the &quot;RAM SWAP&quot; what are my risks? <br /><br />Thank you in advance. <br /><br />I&#039;M NEW TO THIS WORLD :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
