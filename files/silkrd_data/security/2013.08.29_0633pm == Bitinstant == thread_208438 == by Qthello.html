The closest B.O.A for me is over 60 miles, same as a chase bank...so I would be spending about 40 bucks in gas to get a coin..bitinstant was always on point for me..I would make my purchase and have my coin up on the road within 45 mins. every time

				I have not been able to get a coin since the end of May. The two vendors I do use have been pretty awesome in tossing me some nice free samples of things that have kept me going. However, not being able to get a coin and purchase from them is really frustrating me. I wish my state would just make medical legal for crying out loud.

				For what I get, in btc and product...if they want to waste their resources on trying to pin something on me...good fucking luck..because bitcoins are still legal..and what I do after I get them, they will never know.

				If I may recommend a good coin vendor that I&#039;ve great experiences with its &#039;&#039;BTC Boss&quot;&quot; he&#039;s very fast sometimes within minutes he keeps about 10% but its worth it. Check him out, I got mine with netspend reload cards and no minimum either since I&#039;m&nbsp; a poor guy and cant afford most of the coin vendors minimums

				You can buy BTC almost effortlessly (although *not* anonymously) through Coinbase once you&#039;ve done your 30 day waiting period as well.&nbsp; I buy mostly through LocalBitcoins but when I&#039;m in a pinch I can get BTC almost instantly through Coinbase.&nbsp; Obviously you have to be *very* careful about which wallets you send to and other sensitive information.<br /><br />And how on Earth can BitInstant offer 25% off?&nbsp; They must mean off their commission, not price of BTC.

				After localbitcoins, I don&#039;t know how anyone is using anything else. I used to be a Bitinstant user, but f them if they ever come back.<br /><br />Localbitcoins is easy as hell to use and fast as possible, not to mention the prices kill. Many times I have payed less than the current MTGox rate for coin is and add that with no fees. Why would you use any other system.

				Yeah, I am going to try a netspend card, either that or some moneypak thing. If there were a boa or chase closer than 60 miles of me, that would be ideal, however. There is not

				MP seams like you&#039;re easiest solution. There&#039;s got to be a Walgreens or Walmart around you. <br /><br />Walk in, pay cash, walk out.<br /><br />Then come back to the SR and find someone to buy it. I&#039;d probably put on an extra 20% to cover&nbsp; the fee from the person you sell it too.
