				Ok..so I&#039;m not a troll ..this is a real story.I have created a new forum account for my own security reasons. Today I received a phone call from my old neighbor who told me a detective came to my house. asked for my number.then gave him his card.... was curious to see what he wanted so I gave him a call...he said &quot;so I know your picking up ecstasy in the mail. I just want to ask you for more information&quot; then I said&quot; I don&#039;t know what your talking about &quot; he said &quot; we have you on camera, we know you are I just need to ask some questions&quot; I replied with &quot; I&#039;m sorry I have no idea what you are talking about &quot; then he laughed and said &quot; ha ok well good luck&quot; and hung up. I&#039;m freaking out. I know they don&#039;t have me on camera since he thought my neighbor was me so he doesn&#039;t know what I look like...well it was good while it lasted..I&#039;m taking a break. any responses i would greatly appreciate. thanks.

				Damn... These stories really freak me out. Do you know what could have caused you to be under watch. Did you used pgp encryption while buying.<br /><br />I can&#039;t figure out any other way they could have figured out your name and address unless you sent some kind of information unencrypted.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m freaking out&nbsp; ???

				Looks like you have a really chill neighbor. I hope this isn&#039;t a thread just to scare people off; If things escalate, get in contact with a lawyer asap. There is absolutely no price on your &#039;freedom&#039;. I hope this all blows over and you are ok!<br /><br />Best of luck man D:

				I&#039;m not trying to scare anyone.&nbsp; This is real.&nbsp; I lived with a lot of people so they knew I was getting shit in the mail. IDK what It could have been though. If they were watching me they would know where I moved to right? I have a lawyer already..you really think I should give him a call? I just turned off my phone.&nbsp; Maybe they have me on camera at the post office? No, idk what it could be. There is this one person who who to buy a lot from me like 3-5 ounces at a time..i know one their buddies got caught wtih some back in december..but it was just a small amount...the strange thing is they haven&#039;t hit me up for any since. I even tell them i&#039;m going to be getting some and they say they have enough to last them a while. Yes my very first purchase was from Super Trips I didn&#039;t encrypt my address..but He never sent the package I believe. One month I had about 3-4 packages sent to that addy because the vendor fucked up and sent multiple packs to the same address.

				If true, then someone talked.&nbsp; If they had info from SR, whether it be address/order info or USPS found it during transit, there would be a controlled delivery and then raid.&nbsp; Sounds like the LE didn&#039;t mention SR and was asking about &quot;mail&quot; so I would guess they have no clue you are using SR.<br /><br />Since a detective came, then it generally is someone that talked.&nbsp; Either a pissed off roommate or one of your customers that got pinched.&nbsp; Sounds odd, though, they probably have next to nothing otherwise they wouldn&#039;t approach you.&nbsp; I was busted for a felony (not drug related) when I was a young, they pretty much did the same thing.&nbsp; Came to my house, asked some questions, told me they had witnesses and fingerprints.&nbsp; What do you know I admitted more then I should have, a week later they came to my work and arrested me.&nbsp; During trial I found out, no fingerprints, witnesses pretty much said &quot;peeweed was here, he is a troublemaker&quot;... aka nothing of actual evidence.&nbsp; They hung me by my own testimony... so what people above say is completely true.<br /><br />If I were to guess it would be the customers that got pinched, but pick anyone that you told about the &quot;mail&quot; since that seems to be the only thing the LE knows, that and your old address.<br /><br />No more deliveries or stash at your house for a good long while...

They haven&#039;t called me since..weird though .since this person sells a lot of cocaine. they haven&#039;t called me for more ever since...everyone else has. I know they didn&#039;t have me on camera..or don&#039;t even know my age since they thought my neighbor was me and there&#039;s a significant difference in our age. I&#039;m not stashing anything here.I&#039;m done for a lil while till things cool down.

				Soo i take it you have been ordering Bulk amounts in the mail bro?? This shit has me tripping also, cause for the past few months iv had allot of packages delivered, both drugs and just stuff from ebay, i was order legal stuff long before drugs, and i never order much of any thing.. Soon as my last packages come in im finished for a while, Im letting my mail cool down a while, At least i can honestly say i do send out legal electronics i sell on ebay and Listia and receive them.. <br /><br />Im not a dealer or anything.. The most iv ever gotton is a Gram of H and 30 pills is the biggest amount of anything, everything else has been just single pills or a couple.. I live in a smaller town where my PO is pretty laid back and dont seem to really care other thn do their sorting and delivering ..so i hope im OK...<br /><br />I guess since your dealing and having bulk drugs in the mail that could be a reason,<br /><br />your buyers could have got busted<br />someone could have told that knws u get stuff in the mail..<br /><br />IM nervous as shit couse my cousion knws iv got something in the mail, but iv never said what other than medical weed and a few xanax...<br /><br />BTW BRO IM SURE LE IS READING ALL THIS AND THEY MAY RECONIZE UR STORY AND HAVE U DEAD TO RIGHTS ADMITTIING ALL THIS DETAIL ABOUT TODAY..Im thinking could they use what hes said against him if they read this and put 2 and 2 together with the similarities? I dunno maybe not <br />

				Lay low for a few months as far as ordering stuff. I&#039;ve had quite a few orders (not bulk) delivered to my house in the past year. However, I also order 3-6 books through the mail as well, most from ebay or amazon, but some from Europe (Springer - fancy academic books). I&#039;ve ordered stuff from Russia from ebay (postage stamps, I collect them). The letter had Cyrillic writing on them, hopefully this has them wondering. Once several years back I ordered a quarter of weed from the Netherlands, and it arrived with Custom&#039;s Green Tape on it, and a note inside saying something to the effect &quot;your package contained a contraband substance under a certain amount,and that it was confiscated. The second part of the letter (it was a form letter with check boxes) had statements saying something like &quot;You&#039;ve ordered contraband over 1 OZ and that you will be getting a visit, blablabla&quot;, but that part wasn&#039;t checked. I got no visit, and I wasn&#039;t really concerned. Like the person a couple of posts above, just deny, deny, deny. It isn&#039;t illegal to receive shit in the mail as anyone could have sent it to you without your knowledge. And whoever said that the pigs will lie in order to trick you into incriminating yourself are telling the truth, so don&#039;t tell the fuckers anything. <br />Sonething that has me wondering, though - a neighbor about 4 houses down from me has the same initials in his name, and his house number has the same digits as mine although it is a different number (I think he received some 2CB I had ordered. You may want to start ordering &quot;normal shit like books or whatever through the mail just so that, if they are searching your mail, they will get tired of finding nothing. And if they actually arrest you, make them take you to court &amp; prove it - force the already cash-strapped system to spend more money proving something that they probably don&#039;t have any evidence for. Most of all, don&#039;t worry a lot about it at this point.<br />Fuck the Man!! Power to the People!!<br />&nbsp;8)

				Or, you can order one of these packages under &quot;services&quot; on this site - a package that ships from Moldavia or some other E. Eurpoean country that is pot-scented, but has nothing in it. It is apparently for the purpose of throwing off The Man. Just a thought, it is 3 or 4 BTC, so it ain&#039;t super-cheap.<br /><br />Laying low is also a good idea, too.

				It starts with an innocent sounding inquery, then you end up in a little room with someone who pretends to be your friend. One old routine is aptly named &quot;Good cop, bad cop.&quot; It is psycological warfare --they console you and make you think everything will be fine. They know you are a good person, that you did not intend to violate the law. If you just help them and tell the truth they will fight for your freedom.<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe any of their bullshit. Their title is &quot;law enforcement&quot;&nbsp; and ANYTHING you say can AND WILL be used against you.

				Please don&#039;t believe this, people.<br /><br />A detective does not tell you over the phone what the fuck they are after you for, are you fucking serious? <br /><br />They don&#039;t give you time to make a liable plan when they want to catch you in the act and arrest you. <br /><br />How would they know there is ecstasy in the package - if it was a real story, then you could easily get rid of all the pills and just say it was a new jumper or jacket that you were picking up, if they had actually caught you on camera.<br /><br />They caught you on camera and want to ask you questions? Bullshit, if they had camera evidence that showed what was in the package, they would still need the pills to prove the were ecstasy.<br /><br />Even if they caught you on camera opening the package and seeing thousands of pills, they can&#039;t prove it is ecstasy - you could just say it was candy. <br /><br />This is either LE trying to scare people away from using the SR or it is just a stupid troll. <br /><br /><br />If this is real, which I highly doubt - get rid of the pills and deny everything.<br /><br />Possibly even stick your computer that you use SR on to a friends house.

				OK..I&#039;m tired of trying to prove to you guys this is real..believe it if you want. The last pack that never made it was a bulk package from SuperTrips...and I&#039;m not the only one that has a bulk package missing from this guy..a very reputable forum member almost had the same situation happen to him yesterday but I&#039;m not going to mention any names. My very first purchase I didnt&#039; pgp my address since I didn&#039;t know how to...and it was form ST... Also, a few months back I bought some Pure from that domestic vendor Gelatin (or something like that) he had the same gear as Rainbow Vomit..it was really strange ..after I put in my order with Gelatin..he just disappeared..no one ever heard from him again.It never looked like one of my packages were ever opened..cuz if they knew what was in them they would have done a CD. I never opened them in public so there&#039;s no way they have me on camera...and the cops are pretty stupid around here.No they never called me, I called them ..the detective left a card with my neighbor. He never said &quot;watch out&quot; he just said &quot;good luck&quot; Before he mentioned anything about &quot;receiving drugs in the mail&quot; he said &quot;it seems like a lot of people are doin it&quot; i think he said that i&#039;m not sure...i thought he was going to say that I was selling heroin or something..he never said anything about ordering drugs online. just receiving xtc in the mail...i&#039;ve also been getting weird blocked phone calls at random times.IDK if it has anything to do with it..but it&#039;s strange cuz once I pick up the phone they hang up.and they call at random times like 3 or 4 am actually all times of the day.It started happening at my old place..and then once I moved I changed my number and started happening last week. And I never use my house phone so none of my friends have my new house number. I know this story sounds crazy but it&#039;s true I have no reason to make any of this shit up. I love SR and fully Support it ..i&#039;m just letting ya&#039;ll know that this shit really does happen and to be careful.It&#039;s my mistake cuz a lot of people know that I get shit from here or at least over seas.&nbsp;
