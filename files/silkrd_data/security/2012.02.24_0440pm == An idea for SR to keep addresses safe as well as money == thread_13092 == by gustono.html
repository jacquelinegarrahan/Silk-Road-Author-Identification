				Why not use a system, similar to escrow, to save addresses and data about buyers until they are not needed and then deleted once the transaction is completed? <br /><br />It would mean that we can fully trust SR to keep our data safe (unlike buyers who claim they do not keep any addresses) and that the only way a vendor is going to save your data and put you at risk, is if he or her were to purposefully save your data - nothing can be prevented here unfortunately, and probably exists in the current system with sloppy vendors.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I think either way the seller is going to use it the way their system is set up. I also think it is our responsibility as buyers to do research and buy from more well known sellers. There is not guarantee that our information will be taken care of properly. Any seller who does not need your info (again) for any repeat transaction is a huge turn off to me. I understand some sellers want to be more convenient but I am much more comfortable being asked for my information every single time.<br /><br />In general I think your ideas should be taken note of more often by seller and the silk road. Buyers information is very important to take care of properly. The sellers are protected this way and not to sound ungrateful but demand can survive without supply but supply will not survive without demand. Not only that but buyer&#039;s information can be linked just the same.
