				Is this a stupid thing to do? I&#039;m going on a business trip and will be bringing my laptop. I&#039;m in the process of buying some bitcoins and ill need to exercise all of my willpower not to check the trading site I use as well as SR, and maybe even make an order in a couple days.<br /><br />Will the hotel monitor my use of their internet that closely? Am I better off waiting until I get home in 4 days, or am I worrying about nothing?

				If they are monitoring it they will only see that your computer is connecting to the Tor network, not which hidden services you visit.

				I use tor regularly when I travel and I&#039;ve never had any problem. It&#039;s really a good idea in general to use a VPN on any network you don&#039;t trust (like the ones at hotels), TOR has pretty much the same affect for hiding and encrypting your traffic so i doubt anyone would question it even if they did notice (which they probably wont). A lot of places won&#039;t even bother changing the default settings on their router.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about a hotel monitoring you haha. Me and my friends used to go to hotels and simply being on the wifi gave us a view of all of the packets being sent on the network. We could hijack basically anybodies web-cookies, bank sites, facebook, etc, We didn&#039;t do anything malicious though.... xD.. maybe besides breaking some mofos up on facebook. Just a word of advice... don&#039;t log into anything crucial on hotel/public wifi, and don&#039;t leave your computer connected to it for extended periods. If someone with the right know-how is on the network they can virtually, and pretty easily take over any computer also connected to that network, mouse, files, etc. They can look through your files without you even knowing and you could be browsing the internet. Public wifi is scary. It&#039;s also not as hard as people make it sound.<br /><br />If you are worried about the hotel seeing you using Tor, you could always use a bridge. In many countries such as China were Tor is blocked, bridges must be used so the ISP&#039;s cannot immediately identify it as a Tor connection. Once a bridge is identified though it can be black listed. Though i doubt your in China, so even a simple bridge will cover your tracks from someone watching the connection.

				LOL@anonymously going through someones files. College was awesome for that little trick. We used to sit in class and browse all the various workgroups on the network. You could tell the people that never changed any settings besides turning on file sharing. I&#039;d grab that nights party music off of someone elses computer...or that evenings hollywood panty dropper. Kept me from having to download too much of my own p2p stuff. Programs, games, etc. It is pretty scary what&#039;s available.

				be aware, that they are likely to be saving your MAC address. <br /><br />why not go to a bar down the street, check there, then close your laptop and have a beer?<br /><br />odds are, privacy terms are just not too good in the hotel.

I did it for more reasons than just SR, mostly so I can access my resources at work and test external connections on our sites, etc. It&#039;s nice because Tor can be running on a computer not even at my drop too.

				I stay a lot in hotels. I cannot to an anonymous VPN first, and then to Tor. It&#039;s slower, but I think I&#039;m being more secure. They know I&#039;m there, though, because I have to register in order to get on the network.

				Just use TOR bridges. If you use an obfs3 bridge even if they did DPI(which is some china firewall shit not hotel shit) the traffic is disguised as a skype video call or something else innocent yet encrypted.

				Change the MAC address of your network adapter and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />As long as you are browsing from the privacy of your room, there is no way anyone can see you are on SR. All they can see is that you are on tor, and even that can be avoided via obfusproxy or tor bridge use like others have said, although I doubt that&#039;s necessary unless you are a vendor or staff member.<br /><br />If you are in the US or similar country, no hotel is going to care (or even know) that you are connected to tor. Potential targets of surveillance need not apply. For most users, the biggest risk would be your SR browsing being traced back to its originating IP via LE malware or some tor vulnerability. At that point, they can try to look up your MAC address and cross-reference it against customers of that hotel. If you changed your MAC, this won&#039;t be a problem.
