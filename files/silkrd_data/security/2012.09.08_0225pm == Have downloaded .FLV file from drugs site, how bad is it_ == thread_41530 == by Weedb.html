				Hey everybody<br />This weed site is up for 3 months+- and there is weed and bombs for sale over there, anyway, they put a 30 sec. video with stuff inside, and I don&#039;t know what I was thinking, but I&#039;ve downloaded it and pressed &quot;play&quot;. The video was 1.2MB and was exactly as described in FLV format.<br /><br />Is it risky to buy from them right now?<br /><br />And another question I have it about when buying from SR, should I write the address on Privnote. com, or in the checkout page?<br /><br />Thanks everyone have a lovely weekend.

				Hey, Anybody? Of course I deleted the file soon afterwards.<br />Is it risky to buy from their site? Maybe it sounds funny to you but for a noob.... not so much<br />Thanks, <br />Best wishes.

You are going offsite to leave your sensitive information on a clearnet site that could be owned by anyone. People used to think Hushmail was safe too :)

				why would you ever download and run anything you got off of an anon site on your actual computer? If you want the video or software so bad, download it and burn it to a dvd, then take that dvd to your used laptop without internet (everyone has one of these right) and run/watch the file from there. that way you are not risking anything malicious on the computer you use every day to buy your drugs!
