				Hey, so I&#039;m looking into buying my second lot of bitcoins, after my first purchase of just doing a bank transfer I&#039;m looking for something a bit more anonymous, and saw that a few sellers on localbitcoins offer bitcoins for cash in the mail.<br />&nbsp;This sounds good to me, I haven&#039;t seen anyone mention it on here before and was just wondering if anyone had tried it? <br /><br />I&#039;m just a little worried about sending hundreds of pounds in the mail!&nbsp; :-\

				works fine.<br /><br />pick a good vendor and send 20 pounds today. wait for the coins. then send 30 or 50. then 50 again or 100 if you want to. <br /><br />create a new account, use a protected IP / new browser / new vendor (not the one you used to buy via bank transfere). dont use your add as return add. also dont put the coins you bought via bank transfer in the same account as the ones you buy via cash. the ones you already bought... dont use them for illegal activity. dont put anything in the letter (like a cool postcard) the vendor might keep for fun to cover up that there is money in the letter. only use stuff they will throw away right away. because its ugly / not useful. use gloves of you want to. don&#039;t use your home printer to print the add.<br /><br />if you do that, you are as safe as you need to be as a buyer.<br /><br />sure there is still some risk (mainly loosing some cash), but privacy comes at a price. and the risk is not that high after all.<br /><br />But since you have bought bitcoins in the uk, odds are, your whole family is on the government watch list for the next 10 years already. be prepared to be taken in for questioning... i am just kidding... kind of ... :-(

				you can use a charity of your choice with no relation to you as return address. so the money will serve some purpose if it can not be delivered for whatever reason. if you do this, the vendor will know that you want to stay anonymous. but most won&#039;t care. also much better than using no return add for &quot;stealth&quot;.<br /><br />the money you have bought via bank... put it into a save account. use it for legal sh*t or just keep it. also don&#039;t use for legal but &quot;weird&quot; stuff like donating to erowid. If you want to spend it on the road, you need to wash it really well (!!). DO some more reading before you get started on this. my suggestion... keep it where it is. due to the forbes article, more and more people bought coins recenbtly to buy stuff on the road.<br /><br />au.. as you are british.. is it &quot;money you have bought&quot; or &quot;money you bought&quot;? thanks ;-)

				I used Localbitcoins for the first time last week. Why not use someone on there who accepts bank cash deposits? That&#039;s what I did, and by the time I got home, the coins were in my wallet. pm me for the guys contact if you want.

				Just tried localbitcoin today. Went with moneypak...10 bucks cheaper than mtgox listing price for btc..the vendor was patient (as it was first time doing it that way) and I had my coin in 30 minuets. That&#039;s getting the card and then the steps after...super easy. I have found my new btc vendor...until the gov&#039;t takes a shit on them too.

				Used localbitcoins yesterday for the first time. Made a cash deposit at the bank and by the time I made it home the bitcoins were in my account. Was a good experience and the price was slightly cheaper than mtgox and as an added bonus no overseas transaction fees from my bank.<br /><br />Highly recommend. Same principle as Silk Road - Do a bit of research on the sellers and only deposit what you can afford to lose.

				LBC has an escrow system. Usually the buyer has 24 hours to pay before the escrow can be disputed. So buy cash deposit coins tonight and deposit cash the next day during banking hours. Almost impossible to get scammed.
