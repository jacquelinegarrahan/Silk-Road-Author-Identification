				Nothing has happened, I&#039;m just being extra careful. So a few weeks ago I ordered something (legal) from Amazon and it was shipped to my PO Box. Apparently it was too big so they left a slip, which I had to sign and then get in line to get it. I gave them the slip and got my package.<br /><br />Now, the question is... what if I order something from SR and there is a slip in my PO Box? How do I know if I&#039;m signing because the package was too large, or if it was compromised? I&#039;m not sure how this works at USPS as opposed to someone knocking on your door and asking you to sign.

				The simplest answer to your question is &quot;You won&#039;t know.&quot;<br /><br />If your package is domestic, and USPS somehow found out that something was in it, they could be trying to get you to come down and sign for it so they could bust whoever attempts to pick up the package. They would have probably had more information on your activities than just that one package in order to do that. But even if they have information on you, they may not even bust you, they may just want to get you on camera signing for the package at the post office so that they can bust you later or set up surveillance. Or, they may just take the package and wait for you to start filing a claim for it so they can get evidence on you. THere&#039;s lots of ways to go about that.<br /><br />If your package is international and it is stopped by customs, tracking information will just stop as of a certain date, and then if you try to file a claim on the package the site will not let you. You&#039;ll then get a letter from customs advising you of what was was seized and be given paperwork to fill out, along with a notice that they will probably be sending out another notice advising you of some penalty. If it was something really big they may simply come and have a visit with you.<br /><br />I thought it was pretty clear in SR rules that you aren&#039;t supposed to be using PO boxes? It&#039;s funny to me that these rules are made to protect all of us, yet so many blatantly disobey them, and freely admit it like it&#039;s no big deal. It makes me want to ask you who your seller is so that I can not buy from them, but I&#039;m not that big of a dick.

				I have no choice but to use a po box since I live in the city. There are multiple size boxes to rent. Just purchase a mid size box and most packages will fit.<br />

				kidx: there is no universal &quot;no po box rule&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;po boxes opened with fraudulent ID are strongly discouraged.<br /><br />some people don&#039;t have an address to order to for ANYTHING legal or otherwise, except for a po box.<br /><br />don&#039;t be an asshole.
