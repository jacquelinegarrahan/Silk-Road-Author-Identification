				I cashed out some bitcoins the other day on CampBX and sent the money to my Dwolla account like I&#039;ve been doing for over a year but the money never showed up in my Dwolla account and it usually shows up in minutes. So today I&#039;m frantically trying to find my money and I find this link on CampBX:<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h9iyv/psa_dwolla_worse_than_paypal_for_accepting/<br /><br />It&#039;s now against Dwolla&#039;s TOS to accept money from any bitcoin transactions and now I think I&#039;m out a shitload of money I had in my Dwolla account. Bitcoin value is dropping like a rock and all my money may be seized so I&#039;m going on vendor vacation until this works itself out. <br /><br />I don&#039;t trust Bitcoin anymore and I don&#039;t want to sell my stuff if Bitcoin becomes valueless. Game over man I&quot;m out. I sell my reagent tests on the Clearnet if anyone needs my tests in the future.<br /><br />Febb<br />

				I&#039;m sorry that happened to you.&nbsp; I have heard that Dwolla is going after anyone who does buisness with exchanges, as soon as they hit $10k in withdrawls, or if they see a constant stream come through.&nbsp; I was thinking about doing localbitcoins, which is what I would do if I were really in a pinch, but not through dwolla.&nbsp; They are really going to lose a ton of business.&nbsp; &nbsp;CampBX is holding dwolla funds for 13 days, so if you buy bitcoin the first day you can&#039;t touch it for 2 weeks after a 4 day transfer.&nbsp; I&#039;m not giving them my money anymore.&nbsp; Have you looked into coinbase? they do ACH transfers to bank accounts, I&#039;m strictly a buyer, so I don&#039;t know about getting money out, but they gave me a $10k /month limit or $50k/year, IDK exactly, but they DO have a 31 day signup wait, and then 6 days to transfer lately, but it could be a solution, you only gotta give them $1 to signup, coinbase.com.&nbsp; (I am in no way associated with coinbase.com)
