				I have been having trouble using various methods to obtain bitcoins. I am wondering If I can go to a nearby Wal-Mart, buy a pre-paid debit card and use this to buy bitcoins. Is this possible, and if so how?

				It&#039;s possible. The way I know of involves sending the card in the mail to a company which then the company just uses Bitinstant. A good way to get double-fee&#039;d when you could just use bitinstant and do it yourself. Here, I wrote a guide on what I do to get BTC in plenty of threads, I will post it here for you to read and it will hopefully help you to make your first purchase!<br /><br />When I first tried to get BTC, I went with a Wal-Mart moneygram method. I walked into Wal-Mart, over to the costumer services, found out where moneygram is. Then I just stood there trying to figure out how to plug all the information from the invoice into the boxes on the moneygram slip. I just said fuck it and left. This was about a month ago. Anyways, here is the post I made, and it should be really newbie friendly and you will NOT fail if you do it this way!<br /><br />*<br />*<br />1. Went to InstaWallet and bookmarked the address. (I use a Liberte linux OS installed on a jump drive, really nice, there is a thread on it, I recommend doing it.) I also saved it in a file on my desktop, just in case Epiphany cleared the bookmarks for some reason (happened before). The address for instawallet is http://www.instawallet.org/<br /><br />2. Go to Bitinstant (http://www.bitinstant.com/) and select the &quot;Major Bank Branch&quot; in the &quot;Pay From&quot; drop down box. For the &quot;Pay to&quot; box, put &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot;.<br /><br />3. Copy and paste the instawallet&#039;s address and plug it into address text field. Make sure you double &amp; triple check and make sure the address is correct because if you mess up here your money will be gone entirely. Put the amount of money you want to send in the next box (self explanatory). Now, if you haven&#039;t already, I would make yourself a Tormail.org e-mail. It&#039;s really simple to sign up and its over the onion network, so you can feel safe &amp; secure. Their address is (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/). Just click the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button and make your account. Remember your domain name is &quot;@tormail.org&quot;.<br /><br />4. It should take you to a page that has a green button that says &quot;Go&quot; on it. Click it. It should open up a page from &quot;TrustCash Holdings&quot; or just &quot;TrustCash&quot;. You will need to type in your local zip code and select a location you are comfortable with. Selecting a location close is ideal, unless you feel safer driving across town, it is up to you. Just print the invoice and take it into the bank specified, and do the deal.<br /><br />If you are using Liberte, it may be a pain to print the invoice. What I did was, press print to file, then put the file onto a jump drive which I then printed from a computer that had printer drivers on it.<br /><br />Identification is not required. Just go in there, and do what the invoice says. And yes, the invoice is the piece of paper that has a picture of the street where the bank is, and all other information. Just hand them the invoice, they may ask you a few questions (nothing personal, just like how much you are depositing, etc). Then hand over money, get the receipt, and head home. Job well done!<br /><br />I checked my instawallet account after about an hour and a half, but it was there. From here, you can directly transfer the coins into your SR wallet, or run them through a tumbler like bitcoin fog. With bitcoin fog, you will get your coins sporadically over 6 hours (minimum). I just swooped them over to my SR wallet, though. I read that SR has an internal tumbler, but for some this is just too sketchy.<br /><br />I say, if you are confident, and are only ordering a couple personal amounts of drugs, sending straight to SR is fine. But once you start doing orders $100+ I would most definitely bitcoin fog it.<br /><br />Good luck man and enjoy the road!<br /><br />P.S.<br />Look into the Liberte man! You will not be sorry. There is nothing like being 100% secure and always being on the tor network. All you need is a 1gb+ USB stick and a computer. Check it out. (http://dee.su/liberte) The file will be downloaded from sourceforge, so nothing sketchy here! Plus, the home page for the Tor internet browser has a link to the hidden wiki on it, which has a link to tons of things that are located on the deepnet (including SR). All installation consists of is putting a folder on a jump drive, running a .bat file, then booting from the jump drive and inserting your passwords, etc. It has PGP all pre-configured on it. You just put the jump drive in, load it up, and your on Tor! Not to mention it looks cool also.<br /><br />And, you should also visit the link in my signature to learn about PGP. By the looks of it, you will be making orders here on the road. You will NEED to learn PGP/GPG to make orders safely. Were you just planning on sending your name &amp; address unprotected?! Anyways, you can encrypt it so that ONLY the vendor will be able to decrypt it and read your message!<br /><br />You can take my key from my signature also, and then you can test your PGP with me if you want. In a PM, of course.
