				I understand if people don&#039;t want to reveal where they hide their goods but I&#039;m wondering if anyone on here has a truly brilliant stash spot. This is a bit of a fascination for me so I know all the usuals; fake cans, clocks, fake books, the spot between bottom drawer and floor, fake rock, freezer in a pack labeled whatever kind of food, inside speakers and electronics, etc.<br /><br />Just want some ideas from the sneaky genius&#039; out there.

				Small personal doses are hidden inside, but everything else goes outside, in a place them or their dogs would NEVER find :)

				For small amounts I just stash it in the pocket of a sweatshirt/jacket in my closet.&nbsp; I also occasionally take out a ceiling panel and put my goodies up there.

Keeping a clean house is rule #1! When I used to keep weed in the house I would put it inside my computer case. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Having the &quot;pleasure&quot; of having my home searched twice by the scumbags (police) I can contribute something which might save many of you the hassles and nightmares that follow the police home search with a warrant. <br /><br />1. If you are a drug dealer (big or small) and have your drugs at home in visible places (half a kilo of pot in a pantry or 10 grams of coke inside a cookie jar on top of a computer in the bedroom), DO NOT engage in any other illegal activity. Because it takes only a small fuck up for cops to get a search warrant and search your house. It can be a simple fake ID that you showed to police when you got caught shop lifting, they might suspect that you have some stolen items at home and will easily get a search warrant. It can be some fight you got into and now the cops are at your door arresting you, they can legally enter your premises if they need to arrest you and here are the drugs out in the open. The moral is: HIDE YOUR FUCKING DRUGS SO THE COPS WILL NEVER COME ACROSS THEM DOING A REGULAR SEARCH OF THE HOUSE. <br />If they suspect you are dealing drugs then you better not have ANY drugs in your house (unless it&#039;s LSD, mushrooms or other unpopular drugs which the K9s can&#039;t pick up hidden very well in the last place the cops would check). Cops do not call dogs for a random search warrant, HOWEVER if they do suspect you have hard drugs in your house (because you got busted with 10 grams of coke or 1 kilo of pot on your person) then they will bring in the big dogs and they will frisk the shit out of your house inch by inch. Save yourself the nightmare of dealing with cops, never keep hard drugs at home.<br /><br />If you must keep drugs at home or in your apartment, never stash them in your bedroom. If a cop finds any illegal contraband in your bedroom, it&#039;s automatically pinned on YOU! if you share a house with 1 or two other people and they find drugs in the kitchen or other common shared area and none of you confessed to being the owner of the drugs then the courts usually have a hard time proving who the drugs do really belong to. <br />But why even bother with that, don&#039;t keep drugs at home (unless for personal use and stashed really well).<br /><br />2. Hiding drugs inside computers is one of the dumbest things anyone could do. The fact is, one of the first things that cops confiscate in most search warrants on a house is: <br />a) your mobile phone/s<br />b) your computer, laptop and external hard drives<br />If you hide drugs inside them, you are nuts!<br /><br />3. If you are using your PC for illegal activities (internet drug sales, selling stolen goods etc online, having a list of your customers with contact details, photos of illegal stuff etc etc) ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use Linux or another bootable device via a CD ROM or a USB stick. These things use TOR, they leave NO foot prints, no history and are very easy to hide. Even if the cops seize your Linux USB stick, they will not be able to crack into your files because it comes protected with a long ass password and you can always deny any knowledge of what those Linux bootable files are (no comment or I found this USB at school/work). <br />No history or paper trail on your PC of you being a criminal, no problems with police. REMEMBER THAT! <br /><br />4. Like others have said, if you have a stash of guns, drugs, or any other illegal shit, dig that up in a backyard, rent a deposit box where you can covertly hide your stash (bad idea if you are big time and there are cameras filming) or keep it even at work under a lock and key. Cops never check work places if you are running shit out of your house but also have a job because it&#039;s out of their jurisdiction. Obviously you dont want to keep your stuff at work where your colleague or manager can easily come across it. Get a small safe, bolt it down or glue it/velcrow it under your desk/server room/storage warehouse and keep your shit there. The only problem may come up if you get suddenly fired, it might be a little suss if you have to go under your desk while your manager is asking you to leave the premises. But still i think it is a good idea, 100 times better than keeping shit at home. Plus you can always ask a friend who works there to retrieve it for you afterwards. <br /><br />5. Remember that usually when someone is doing illegal stuff, they are more likely to engage in more than one activity which breaks the law. So if you are dealing drugs and making say $1000 a week from it, you would be pretty stupid trying to shoplift $10 worth of chocolates only to get busted and then have the cops raid your place because they think you have more stolen goods at home... which is laying right next to that big bag of weed! <br /><br />6. NEVER EVER stash your illegal shit in your spot at home. Big chance that if the cops come across it, they will find your entire pandoras box! BAD BAD BAD! if you must hide shit at home (bad idea man) at least have 3-4 different hiding spots which are hard to come across. If they find one stash, there are still 3 others left. Cops are lazy, they hate searching through dirty clothes, dusty curtains etc... so make their life easier by hiding your shit right.<br /><br />7. Dont have any evidence lying around your house (dealers/buyers names etc). Keep it on your Linux protected USB key which is password protected. If you think you are about to get raided, make sure to have a copy of that USB key somewhere safe, like at work and destroy it when the LE knocks your door down. <br /><br />8. If you are dealing drugs on SR, deal it on SR only. NEVER deal out of your house. Cops bust dealers in real life because someone has snitched. On SR, snitches are as rare as dinosaurs.<br /><br />9. Remember that cops are one of the most dirtiest, horrible, lying low life pieces of scum you will ever come across, especially when you are under arrest. They will treat you like dirt, like as if you raped some little kid, even if your charge is worth fuck all really. Off course not all cops are like this, but majority of cops are horrible, mean fucks who were abused at kinder by bigger and stronger kids. You never want to get busted in the first place. <br /><br />10. When interviewed by the cops or any LE, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT UNTIL YOU SPEAK TO YOUR LAWYER. NEVER EVER CONFESS TO COPS! You can always plead guilty to any charge at the court in front of the judge, they will never penalise you for saying &quot;no comment&quot; to police. Cops want you to spill your guts because it makes their job so much easier. It&#039;s like a Burger King kid telling customers to make their own burgers and fill in their own cokes... make the cops find real hard evidence and present it to the courts, you might think you are a goner but the cops many times can&#039;t prove shit even if you are caught red handed... NEVER CONFESS TO POLICE!&nbsp; <br /><br />Re-read the above points 10 times and stay safe. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

Sure, storing drugs at home is never a great idea, but I would never stash it at my place of employment. First of all, it&#039;s not readily accessible so you have to wait until you go to work to even tap into your supplies. Secondly, if stashing my loot at home is not an option, I would most likely just get a small waterproof safe and&nbsp; store it outside somewhere nearby: to me, this seems to be a much safer alternative.

				Freeze it inside a large amount of ground beef.&nbsp; Buy the ground beef from a meat counter, have them double wrap it in wax paper.&nbsp; This way when you get home you can re-wrap it at your discretion.&nbsp; &nbsp;This also works for transportation (bring dried ice/ cooler)<br /><br />I thought of this myself, works wonders, I have never posted this anywhere, because I was still using it. I got out of the game when I found SR, much safer,<br /><br />Remember, don&#039;t stash where you live.&nbsp; If you do drugs on the reg, you might not have a choice.&nbsp; If you are a responsible drug user, you don&#039;t use daily, you don&#039;t keep drugs at your house.&nbsp; Those two go hand in hand.

				Thinking I might go with a Safety Deposit box, anybody know what the rules are on that vis a vis cops, getting searched, etc?<br /><br />So if I left 6 bucks and half a crack rock in a deposit box would it be safe? Don&#039;t really know how they work but would anybody even be able to link the box to me directly if I pay cash, or if they could would anyone be able to find out I was even renting one?

				Nice post mate =)<br />Hang on though, I know LSD is odorless, which makes it fairly easy to send, However Surely some dog could pick it up, There must be a low level odor of somekind. Because if there isnt you could easily stash LSd tabs. <br />Waterproof safe is a great idea however i will say this, If you bury it, and wrap it in plastic etc, Its a great stash, However its a major pain to travel to in order to get thigs from, If you just hide it somewhere the chances of it being found are quite high and if you have to go there daily, It can be a real pain. I had an outdoor stash once, Years back before i knew about the road. And i had a pill bottle, screw on lid, (big bottle) and filled it with bags of seperate things, wrapped it in plastic bags and stuck it in a bush somewhere. Right in front of peoples noses. Never got found. But it was dodgy as hell going there. <br /><br />You can do things, but its hard to come up with great ideas..Thats what makes them great :D

But it was dodgy as hell going there. <br /><br />You can do things, but its hard to come up with great ideas..Thats what makes them great :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I live in an apartment building so I don&#039;t have a yard and honestly there is 0 chance I&#039;m gonna go bury a heap of drugs somewhere. Honestly think I would face more risk of them accidently being found, somebody seeing me go to/from the spot, etc. than I face being raided or anything like that. If I lived in a small town or something like that maybe but the city I live in...nahweh.

				The weed dealer in my building just keeps his stash in tupperware containers and jars, somehow there&#039;s no smell. I think he also uses a charcoal filter for the air.<br /><br />Weed is a misdemeanor here, so he&#039;s not worried being busted. The more exotic illegal shit he keeps buried a few blocks away in a large forested area in waterproof containers he only touches with gloves so no fingerprints. You can also store drugs in hollowed out appliances. Buy a microwave, old computer monitor, TV, fridge or something and remove everything mechanical inside it, keep sealed drugs in there and screw back on the housing. Hope to god no drug drugs come in.<br /><br />I have a friend who&#039;s a cop that I mine for intel. The first places they check are vents looking for strings danging the drugs, they also check fans in the bathroom, and window sills. Lot&#039;s of people tape drugs to inside the toilet back cover, and dangle them down drains with floss too.

				underbelly, +1 on a solid post. You made many great points.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about storing my gear at work, but hey, to each his own.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is you can store in your house...as long as you are not dealing from your house.<br /><br />You should never deal from where you leave, PERIOD!<br /><br />So, unless you are a drug dealer AND something else clandestine, law enforcement should never feel the need to come to your house for anything.<br /><br />However, since it CAN occur, you need to make sure your house is clean as a whistle, everything that is stored is stored in a odor proof way, and preferably on the property and not directly in the home.<br /><br />I will say this, and I am done, if the cops come to your house it is not because they are that smart, it is because knowingly or unknowingly you did something dumb.<br /><br />TRUST ME, I am speaking from experience! Those mofo&#039;s only know of the ONE mistake you make, not of your entire operation, as long as you tell them NOTHING when they show up.<br /><br />Keep it SR my friends...

				I&#039;ve always been curious, when cops come and search a house, what if they find, lets say, less than an oz of weed and a bong and that&#039;s it?Will they bust you on that? Or will they say fuck it?<br /><br />+1 to underbelly as well.<br /><br />Storing shit at work all depends on where you work and what you do.

So if your involved in illegal drug activity, where they know you are and what they know you own is subject to search, thus nothing illegal should be there. This goes especially if a package is very late, it may have been intercepted, and in the case of domestic, or bulk international the delay could be a controlled drop. Never keep anything in your house if you can help it.

				I don&#039;t think this would be used for large amounts anyway, but I simply emptied out a deodorant can, cut off the top just above where the lid would go and washed it out. It looks and even feels exactly like a semi-full deodorant can when full and being used, and the lid is fairly sturdy and can come off easily when I twist it.<br /><br />It works great for keeping my weed in and just keeping it in the bathroom/on top of my wardrobe, but I forget to use it most of the time really ;D<br />Great for traveling with as well!<br />Locker.

				Some interesting ideas in here.&nbsp; Honestly some that seem like great ideas and others that seem downright foolish.&nbsp; I think burying it is generally the best idea... either that or maybe stashing it way high up in a tree where dogs won&#039;t be able to smell it (this second idea is more a question than an assertion).&nbsp; Apartments suck because there typically isn&#039;t a good place to bury things near you since the common areas usually have high traffic and groundskeepers who would notice a dug-up area.&nbsp; Plus as mentioned before if you share the house then drugs found buried may be difficult to pinpoint on one resident or the other.<br /><br />Randoms forests / parks near you is a good idea depending on how often you think you&#039;ll have to travel there.&nbsp; If you have to access your stash you may want to consider doing it at night when there are probably fewer cops working and when your neighbors are asleep.<br /><br />A decent idea that I&#039;ve realized is that you can change your address on your ID to your parents&#039; house or a friend&#039;s place... that way if they ever look your identity up they will go to the wrong house.&nbsp; Hopefully your parents and / or friends will give you a call (alert) when the cops come knocking at your door.<br /><br />Some things are obvious like don&#039;t do too much other illegal stuff at your place, even parties are questionable since cops respond to noise complaints.<br /><br />I was selling for a while out of my apartment (would meet clients out in the parking lot so they wouldn&#039;t know where I lived) and bought a secret &quot;safe&quot; that looks like an electrical outlet and put it in my walk-in closet.&nbsp; I was selling MDMA though and if a dog were to sniff around my apartment I probably would have been toast.

				When I was working for a small electronic manufacturer, I hid my LSD in the work freezer. I never store large qty. of anything at the casa. Might have large qty of small denominations of various nefarious substances squirreled about, depending upon my mood, the way the wind blows up my skirts, and did the virgin Mary show up on another window. <br /><br />Those would be stored in my China cabinet, in one of my book shelves, in the large dry bags of dog and cat food, or even in a turd sandwich. Hah, and come looking without a warrant, don&#039;t worry about me, my two GS and my Pittbull will be the worst day of your life.

				A few assumptions I would make:<br /><br />If LE is spending the man hours searching your house (and it&#039;s not just a &quot;noise complaint where they saw a bong on the table when you opened the door&quot; impromptu search), they will be <br /><br />a) pretty damn sure you&#039;re holding<br />b) keep searching until they find something<br /><br />So yeah, if you want to last as a professional, gotta keep it hidden in an area that you do not control.<br /><br />The problem with finding a place offsite is that it needs to meet the following requirements:<br /><br />a) no one can &#039;stumble&#039; onto your stash accidentally<br />b) you can extract/replace your stash safely out of sight<br />c) you have a plausible reason for being there<br /><br />Also, in the &#039;nice to have&#039; category, this place is also:<br /><br />a) convenient and close by <br />b) has multiple approaches and exits<br />c) is on the way to/from a place you have a plausible reason for going to<br /><br />Since the laws are still hazy on warrant less GPS tracking (or your &#039;bro&#039; could spend a few hundred $ on a magnetic GPS and rip off your stash spot), anyone following or GPS tracking you would not find any deviation to your travel that would indicate a stash spot. <br /><br />Anyone have any other criteria for the list they can think of?

				A guy I know has been raided at least 5 times since getting out of jail after being not guilty of ecstasy trafficking, and each time the cops have found nothing.<br /><br />However every time I have been to his home, he has been in possession of between 5-10 thousand pills, and he stashes them somewhere in the house.<br /><br />We have no idea how he hides them, and he doesn&#039;t give us any clues except to say that the cops would literally have to demolish his house to find his stash. The cops know he has drugs, and they can never find them.<br /><br />One time he had a really close call, cops knocked on his door after a domestic and he had about 500 pills sitting in his kitchen not stashed. He ran out the back door and threw them over the fence into his neighbors yard. They cops searched his place and found nothing. The next day his neighbor found the stash and called the police who came and raided him straightaway, finding nothing again. They spent 4-5 hours going through his house and were beyond filthy when they couldn&#039;t find anything. They then filed charges against him but the case fell apart in the committal hearing as there were no fingerprints or DNA on the stash his neighbor found. A close friend was at court with him and reckons he has never seen a bunch of cops looking so pissed off.<br /><br />We all call him &#039;Teflon&#039; because no matter what the cops do to him they can never get a case to stick. He even managed to get some compensation for the time he spent in jail before being found not guilty :)<br /><br />So if you are clever enough and have a bit of knowledge of various trades you can probably devise a stash spot that will fool the cops, however if you manage to do this, never ever share it!

				Oh my godness, the first few &#039;tips &amp; tricks&#039; are so awful, that I assume these ppl to be cops or kids. I saw each of these in different TV-shows and you can be sure LE saw them too ;D Just one simple trick for LE to see if you modified some electronics is to plug them in and see if they work. Forget the fridge, they know it. They open up everything stored in your fridge, even when it looks like u never opened it.<br />If you really have no choice to hide sth outside, try to find a hidden spot in a shared basement of your apartement complex. If you are in need of hiding it in your room it has to be something noone would ever think it is possible to open up or that there would even be any space to hide sth. If LE wants to fuck you, they will search until they find sth and if it takes the whole day, it takes the whole day.<br /><br />And by the way, it is no private chit chat here...every new super stealth master mind hidden spot revealed here won&#039;t be a super stealth master mind hidden spot anymore :D

The cops know he has drugs, and they can never find them.<br /><br />One time he had a really close call, cops knocked on his door after a domestic and he had about 500 pills sitting in his kitchen not stashed. He ran out the back door and threw them over the fence into his neighbors yard. They cops searched his place and found nothing. The next day his neighbor found the stash and called the police who came and raided him straightaway, finding nothing again. They spent 4-5 hours going through his house and were beyond filthy when they couldn&#039;t find anything. They then filed charges against him but the case fell apart in the committal hearing as there were no fingerprints or DNA on the stash his neighbor found. A close friend was at court with him and reckons he has never seen a bunch of cops looking so pissed off.<br /><br />We all call him &#039;Teflon&#039; because no matter what the cops do to him they can never get a case to stick. He even managed to get some compensation for the time he spent in jail before being found not guilty :)<br /><br />So if you are clever enough and have a bit of knowledge of various trades you can probably devise a stash spot that will fool the cops, however if you manage to do this, never ever share it!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This post just made my fuckin night.

				A magician never reveals his greatest trick, but I&#039;ll share a tip:<br /><br />Have two layers to your stash:<br /><br />1) Seal up your stuff with something relatively airtight. Depending on your paranoia, this could be anything from a baggie to a MBB-wrapped bear canister. Go nuts.<br /><br />1.5) Clean the outside of the airtight container. Go nuts here too: soap, isopropyl alcohol, fungicide, dog pee neutralizer, anything that shines.<br /><br />2) Disguise that inside an innocent-looking container, which either has a trick open (like those &quot;Magic Boxes&quot;), or is just incredibly inconvenient to open. This way, if somebody just casually happens across the item, they won&#039;t try opening it.<br /><br />As has been said before, the best stash is one that belongs to somebody who isn&#039;t on the police&#039;s radar from the beginning.

Plus people LOVE to talk. I can see no harm storing a kilo of drugs or weapons or some other contraband which will not take up much space at your relatives or friends house as long as its: 1)tightly locked up 2) well hidden from the house owners themselves. But then again yo are putting other people in danger and i think its irresponsible.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think one of the next best things is to either store the items at another area which you have access to (gym locker, work, self storage which you rent under someone else&#039;s name, etc etc). Just make sure that if you are using someone else&#039;s details to rent storage space, dont keep any evidence of that around at home or in your wallet. Burn those receipts. Some guy got busted on a motorbike and cops found a receipt to a self storage spot under another ID, they went to it and found kilos of drugs, and something crazy like a few million of $$$. If the news story is true, the guy must be kicking himself.<br /><br />And as always, never keep shit in plain sight at home.&nbsp; Not your bong, not your 200 grams of coke. <br /><br />Stay safe.
