				Title: <strong>Setting up a secure hidden service</strong><br />

				I want to set up my own hidden service, just a simple small html site for no reason other than personal interest and to learn a bit more about computer security in the process. I love cryptoanarchy and it really appeals to me as a hobby.<br /><br />How do I get started? I have a limited understanding of basic programming and web development, but I&#039;m eager to learn.<br /><br />I was hoping to have some kind of setup involving Whonix with physical isolation, where the web server is in a VM on one computer, with the other computer acting as a gateway to protect against having the IP address of my site revealed if it was hacked. Is this setup pretty much 100% secure?

				You could get 2 Raspberry PI, where one has 2 ethernet interfaces and is connected to your router, like a physically isolated Whonix gateway. The other PI is connected to the the gateway PI (Tor) only and runs the webserver (lighttpd?). However I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s possible to have 2 ethernet interfaces on a Raspberry PI. But it should be possible with USB-&gt;Ethernet adapters?<br /><br />When the webserver gets hacked, the attacker couldn&#039;t get your real IP address. First they&#039;d have to hack the gateway PI from the webserver PI, which is highly unlikely if only Tor and nothing else is running on the gateway. Usually you&#039;d want to be able to connect to the both PI&#039;s by using SSH, so you&#039;d have to firewall them properly (only allow SSH connections from gateway to webserver, but none from inside the webserver to the gateway). Should be like 99.999999% secure that way.<br /><br />I&#039;ve installed a hidden service with lighttpd in&nbsp; a Debian virtual machine yesterday. It was quite easy. Took me an hour or so. I simply created a virtual machine on another computer, then had a look at the hidden service instructions on the Tor website.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If your computer isn&#039;t online all the time, your hidden service won&#039;t be either. This leaks information to an observant adversary.<br />It is generally a better idea to host hidden services on a Tor client rather than a Tor relay, since relay uptime and other properties are publicly visible.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en
