				Here&#039;s my .02 cents on safety and choosing vendors PROPERLY. <br /><br />Recently I ordered prescription meds from a vendor butch1200. I ordered them to my drop, which I use for delivering schedule A drugs. Due to safety reasons I won&#039;t reveal here much detail about it but i DO have reasons for not signing deliveries. That&#039;s why I always order regular mail (even if it takes FE) and did the same this time. <br /><br />After 10 days had passed and nothing showed up and I noticed that the vendor has pulled his listings down and went stealth. A bit worried I contacted the vendor and asked, whether he is sure he had actually dispatched the item. He answered that he did it personally but offered immediate reshipment asking for my address. I considered that he hadn&#039;t shipped my order but wanted to safe face, so I just passed him my address again. <br /><br />Next day he sends me a message that my order was shipped with REGISTERED mail. I am like WHATAFUCK? Why didn&#039;t ask prior? So now I have no other option than refuse the package. <br /><br />After I told the vendor I won&#039;t sign for anything, he showed me a statement from his vendor page:<br />Shipping Option: regular mail (Only available for regular customers)<br /><br />So, as far as I understood, I was NOT a regular customer, though I was allowed to choose &quot;regular mail&quot; delivery anyway and if he was honest about the first shipment, it was actually dispatched with regular mail. Then on the second shipment he had just switched a delivery method without notifying me about it. Nice. In my opinion, if it was my fault to carefully read and understand his politics, he should have cancelled my order right away instead of switching delivery methods on his own. That&#039;s it. Cuz it&#039;s both his and my SAFETY.<br /><br />To be honest, I consider finalizing this order without opening a dispute, cause 15 bucks are just not worth damaging my refund-rate. But I think it was a good lesson of not ordering from vendors without clear safety background, which means don&#039;t order from whom you don&#039;t trust in terms of safety. <br /><br />God blessed it was only a cheap prescription med and nothing serious.<br /><br />Before this case I ordered only from good/star vendors with massive amount of references posted on the forum. To give you a background, my stats prior to this order were following: <br /><br />Total transactions: 14<br />Total spent: ~ $1100<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months<br /><br />P.S. I consider rating this vendor 2/5, cause communication was good all the way, though there&#039;s no point in good communication while your safety sucks shit. <br />
