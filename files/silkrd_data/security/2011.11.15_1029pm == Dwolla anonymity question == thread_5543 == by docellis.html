				Hey,<br />So i have, for every transaction i have done, gone bank account&gt;Dwolla account&gt;mtgox&gt;SR.<br />When i originally made my Dwolla account they didnt ask for anything to verify identity so I used a fake name for extra security.<br /><br />Yesterday i put in another request on Dwolla to transfer money from my bank. Today, i was notified by Dwolla that I need to verify my identity with a Social Security Number. Obviously, i do not have a SSN for the name my account is under. <br /><br />Do you guys use your real name for accounts such as this and is it safe to do so? I think i can fix this if it is deemed safe and secure. If not, I suppose i&#039;ll just have to leave my account to be suspended and find another route to the ever evasive bitcoins.<br /><br />Thanks

				I don&#039;t have an answer for you on your Dwolla question, but after going the same route as you a few times, I tried get-bitcoin.com and can&#039;t imagine going back to Dwolla&gt;MtGox.&nbsp; Less than 24 hours from cash in your had to BTC in your SR account.&nbsp; Good stuff.<br /><br />I have to say, though, I would probably let Dwolla go rather than give up my SSN... They do have my real name though, as I thought that was probably necessary to access my bank accounts, so it probably doesn&#039;t much matter.

				I&#039;m not sure why you would use a fake name for dwolla.&nbsp; How do you deposit/withdraw your money to/from dwolla? Isn&#039;t that shit ACHed directly to your bank account?

				I looked at Dwolla as well as MtGox. Both wanted waay too much info. I use CampBx. All you have to do is establish a User Id. To fund the account I send, by mail, Money Orders. They have an excellent Trading Platform that allows you to use Margin(Buy BC&#039;s on Leverage &amp; do fancy Trades like shorting) You can also Send and receive BC&#039;s through thier Automated BC System. I Love it so far!

				All of these are subject to regs. That does not mean that they can trace the SR transaction to the BTC&#039;s, no matter how explicit the block chain. It&#039;s a reach. A Massive effort is required to tie the transaction ends together. if you buy coins on Gox, and do a direct transfer, I am not sure of the traceability.
