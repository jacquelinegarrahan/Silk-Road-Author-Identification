				no- never used Tor to access Mt.Gox.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had huge numbers of BTC in and out - just send what I need to make purchases - these are coming from Dwolla linked to my Bank. I never went over their high daily/monthly limits.<br /><br />ETA: The amount of BTC that I was sending over to SR was between 10-50 BTC (sorry, trying to be vague)<br /><br />I made an order or two or three within the last 7-10 days and they were for fairly small amounts.<br /><br />I have no idea why I got singled out.<br /><br />I tried without success to just send all my BTC over to Dwolla so I could cash out and figure something out - I DO NOT want to verify my account - but I will have to in order to get my fucking money back.<br /><br />and it won&#039;t be to tomorrow - like a week at the soonest - what a hassle... and I can&#039;t tell you how excited I was adding some treats from SR that I rarely see and than at the final checkout - a big FUCK YOU !!!<br /><br />sorry - just venting out of complete frustration - I wanted my treats from SR and if not I at least want my god damn money returned to my without this fucking hassle.<br /><br />OK - now it&#039;s time to smoke the shit out of some kind bud and hash and settle down with a bit of xanax and klonopin (perhaps some restoril later on tonight that my mate gave me earlier)<br /><br />I know people get fucked around buying BTC via moneypaks on SR - I did it a few times, no problem. I used Tradehill before they shut down and I know Vendors and Sellers get kicked in the balls from time to time - I guess tonight it my turn...<br /><br />ETA: tradehill=dead, MPs-to-BTC on SR=RISKY, Mt.Gox can Fuck Themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp;so, what is left? Bit Instant? If anyone has a moment of free time: can you sum up the process for Bit-instant in like two sentences&nbsp; -&nbsp; I will up more tomorrow. <br /><br />Thing is, SR is like a gift from the Gods - I could not get half the shit, at half the quality I can here - I do not want to leave !!!

				Cheers, KittyKat on the suggestion.<br /><br />I opened up an account with them and tried sending over all my BTC from Mt.Gox to them - but denied.<br /><br />This is what it reads after each time I hit Transfer/Confirm: &quot;Your account is currently pending review, please visit https://mtgox.com/forms/verification&quot;

				I&#039;m guessing MtGox flags transactions to TOR related node/ips as well (I&#039;m guessing SR), try transfering to your own Wallet first (your IP&#039;s already logged), then worry about mixing it after.<br /><br />BitInstant btw gives you a MtGox coupon or some other vendors, if your accounts are locked wont help much. They do work with CryptoXChange which i&#039;ve never used.<br /><br />Note: The above is pure speculation based on who i&#039;ve seen get their accounts locked and people I know moving 2500+ of BTC a month through MtGox without issue.

				thanks much, Raven for the advice&nbsp; -&nbsp; I will look into that in the morning. <br /><br />When I am logged into Mt.Gox, I can sell my BTC for the going rate ie cash and then buy the BTC back using the cash in the account&nbsp; -&nbsp; I simply cannot move my money, whether&nbsp; BTC or cash out of Mt. Gox to anywhere. I will give your advice a try - but as of yet - I can&#039;t move my money out - keeps saying I need to send in all the documents to prove and satisfy them I am not money laundering (anti-laundering)

				Unfortantly if your account is locked its too late. <br /><br />Does anyone know what MtGox does once an account is locked? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do they report accounts where once locked the person just &#039;ups and leaves&#039;? (Walking away from cash is odd)<br /><br />Wish I had better advice for what you should do :(

				This is what has to happen if you want your money and/or bitcoins. You WILL have to send them a scan of your passport/drivers license &amp; 1 recent utility bill with your address matching your ID. DO NOT BOTHER THEM AFTER THIS. I repeat, DO NOT EMAIL THEM AT ALL! This only pisses those little MagicFags right off, and they will delay your processing. Don&#039;t worry your ass off over this. It&#039;s an automated flagging. I am REALLY surprised to hear you weren&#039;t accessing with TOR...were you using Peer Guardian, HideMyIP, or some sort of service? you have to clearnet MTGOX all the way. And I say don&#039;t worry, because it&#039;s just 5-6 Magic The Gathering guys (hence MTGOX, Magic The Gathering Online Exchange) chillaxin in Japan, reaping the rewards of their pyramid scheme called Bitcoin. Governments got mad at the dough they were raking in without paying any taxes, so it&#039;s just a bit of redtape they have to peel every now and then. They want you buying/selling bitcoin, so they don&#039;t have to work. It&#039;s all just paperwork, no one is looking....unless, of course, you DO go over those limits. Also watch your tax brackets in your respective area. You can only &#039;earn&#039; a certain amount before you have to start claiming. Or open a shell biz.

				I think SuperDimitri is right on this.&nbsp; It reflects what I have seen reported on MTCOX accounts for guys on the up and up.<br /><br />I know of some private torrent sites that take BTCs as donations (in fact that&#039;s where I first learned of the existence of a clandestine site at which one could safely by stuff--SR).&nbsp; Any who some of the guys who were trying to make contributions had the same thing happen.&nbsp; It appears to be a routine (and perhaps random) thing at MTGOX to accommodate governments over potential money-laundering.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat it, just provide the information and go on with your business. <br /><br />Cheer! :)

				Cheers on the replies - everyone is correct.<br /><br />I just needed to sedate myself properly as I was a bit too pissed. BTW, I always have PeerBlock running - I run bit torrents all the time - even the 7 moths I have been on the road - doubt it was that.<br /><br />Can say it wasn&#039;t accessed by Tor and my money was not that much.<br /><br />Correct, these are just some paper work hassles and then I can get my money and fuck right off !!!<br /><br />but, trade hill is dead, MP&#039;s-to-BTC via SR is RISKY and Spendy, Mt. Gox can now fuck off, what else is there left to do that is as easy as these past three services.<br /><br />But, like I said, I flew into a rage after filling my shopping cart only to find out I could not access my money. It will take a week to get them what they need and get my money back. Now I have to find my FOURTH way to get my BTC...<br /><br /><br />Cheers to those who posted.

				toeless- bitinstant is so easy, cheap, and anonymous<br /><br />go to their site and put how much you are gonna deposit and where to, i uae mtgox with no problems but i send it to instawallet and bitcoinfog before going to SR i dunno if that makes a difference. anyway bitinstant will give give you the amount you need to deposit and finds a participating bank close to you. then you go there and give them the account number and name (trustcash inc) and the cash. once youre home you might already have the email with the mtgox coupon, if not its guaranteed within the hour. simple

				Exact same thing happened to me.&nbsp; No use asking why, just supply the required forms &amp; move your Bitcoins elsewhere once you can.&nbsp; MtGox is working with the DEA and as such, is pretty much making Bitcoins anything but anonymous currency.&nbsp; <br />Next time, use another Bitcoin exchange or find an indirect way to get your Bicoins from MtGox to SR, possibly by using tumblers or a similar method that obscures the ownership of your Bitcoins.&nbsp;

				It&#039;d be more likely they&#039;re cooperating with the Department of Treasury since Bitcoins are used for a lot more than just Silk Road, but no one accepting bitcoins reports their earnings, pays taxes on their earnings, etc.<br /><br />From Mt. Gox&#039;s TOS: &quot;Members agree that they will not use the Platform to perform any type of illegal activity of any sort, including, but not limited to, money laundering, terrorism financing, or negatively affect the performances of the Platform.&quot;<br /><br />However, they also say re: verification:&nbsp; &quot;Please note that we will only release your information if we are subpoenaed by the Supreme Court of Tokyo.&quot;<br /><br />PayPal does the same thing.&nbsp; Mt. Gox is a victim of their own success - they really had no choice to cover their ass against accusations that they&#039;re funding terrorists or druglords or something.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t use them.

				[quote will mtgox lock you out for 1500usd using clearnet at all times?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />sounds low - but might add up over a month&#039;s worth of shifting money&nbsp; -&nbsp; just go to their site&nbsp; -&nbsp; the limits are clearly posted and very specific with what you can/can&#039;t do, and if you do you something listed as a no-no, you just wind up having to Verify your account. <br /><br />After the three ways I&#039;ve gotten my BTC so far, I really like the Dwolla/Mt.Gox combo&nbsp; - only thing that sucked was the consist 5 days it would take your bank wire transfer to appear on Dwolla, but I was keeping plenty of BTC in MtGox - one, because I wanted easy and fast access to BTC so I could place SR orders&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;the other reason was I was fairly sure BTC value would have been going up by now - seen it over 5, but always drops back down into the. 4.5-4.8 mark. As I have lost good money a long while back with drops in BTC value, I just to once, wanted to make some money...&nbsp; I thought I might see 8-10 by now.<br /><br />I see BTCKing is no longer doing the MP-to-BTC thing - wants cash deposited into a bank of his choosing. I will later read up on other ways to get my BTC.<br /><br />&nbsp;- - - the messanger, thanks again for that link you posted. It answered some questions as to why people, mostly me, had their account locked and Verification was need to get you money/BTC back.<br /><br />Looked like someone stole a few BTC from one dealer - like TadeHill or Mt. Gox, but not them ,someone else&nbsp; - and Mt. Gox locked a bunch of accounts thinking some of their BTC found their way around - just like a stolen USD bill can get robbed from a Bank, get spent at a gas station, then given as change to customer who uses it to buy groceries, and than it is given for change to another customer and on and on&nbsp; -&nbsp; but Mt. Gox seems like they will not be returning the stolen BTC to the rightful owner - they are going to confiscate it and keep it for themselves... <br /><br />thanks again - I just could not figure out if I had done something wrong to get flagged and ordered to verify - add that to the frustration of having a full cart on SR and then not being able to access your BTC/money.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.<br />

				My advice, stay away from all public exchanges and anything involving bank accounts or any form of personal information. The same thing is going to happen to them all sooner or later. It&#039;s a PITA but you need to start using cash by mail if you are at all concerned about anonymity and security.

This is another reason we need to have an ID on file that matches your account in this specific case.<br /><br />As soon as you submit the required documents for verification, you can do whatever you want with the funds on your account. Note that not submitting an ID doesn&#039;t mean nothing will happen. If a criminal investigation is indeed in progress, we won&#039;t be able to deny access to other identifying records such as IP address and others. This doesn&#039;t mean either we will provide private details to just any court either.<br /><br />--<br /><br />It&#039;s clear they don&#039;t want you to be anonymous, as noted by not using TOR on the site, but this quote basically is saying that if you want to use their service you have to forgo your anonymity.

				UPDATE:<br /><br /><br />Mt.Gox locked me out of my account last Friday until I completed their Verification Process. I have not yet sent in copies of my DL/passport, etc but for some strange reason I was able to get out all of my money/BTC and cleared out of there.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know why I was flagged to begin with, and for some other reason, I logged in a short while ago and tried once more to transfer my money/BTC out of Mt.Gox and it worked !!!<br /><br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure bitinstant just gives you a pin# after you buy mtgoxUSD. Turn around and trade it for bitcoins on #bitcoin-otc don&#039;t even bother signing up to mtgox if worried about IDs and verification.<br /><br />

And can require a whole shitload of verification. And when utilizing MtGox&#039;s cash deposit option (obviously the most anonymous) they add about another 4% fee on top. Plus MtGox isn&#039;t accessible/usable via TOR. If you wanna know all of the multitude of reasons NOT to do business through dwolla, do some searching, they&#039;ve been exposed numerous times as both a pain in the ass and a security risk. Do you realize how much information you have to give to MTGox/Dwolla?<br /><br />Also, Get-Bitcoin&#039;s verification only requires a scan of a photo ID. No social or phone number or birthday or anything. Just download some fake license templates and with 15-30 minutes in photoshop they won&#039;t look twice.

				Fuck Mt. Gox... I tried to transfer my BTC from there to SR&nbsp; (bad idea i know) and it shows up as a transaction yet I never got my coins. Don&#039;t know how they&#039;re allowed to do that, but be careful with these assholes.

I used them for a month or two - who knows - never a problem. I made a few small transactions a few days with no problems before they lock me out until I verify. Exactly one week later I logged back in and tried to send my money/BTC out of there and for some other strange reason it let me. I got my BTC back w/out Verifying and I am finished with them.<br /><br />Now onto the next way to get my BTC... I&#039;ve done TradeHill, I&#039;ve done risky and high fee BTC Vendors on SR, etc,
