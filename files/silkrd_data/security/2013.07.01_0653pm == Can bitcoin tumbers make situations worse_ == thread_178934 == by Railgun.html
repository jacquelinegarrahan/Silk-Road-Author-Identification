				So let&#039;s say this is the case:<br />&nbsp; -You purchase some BTC.<br />&nbsp; -You place said BTC in a tumbler for a good wash<br />&nbsp; -New Taliban Leader or Head Child Pornographer also puts in coins<br />&nbsp; -You now have some Taliban Leader/CP coin<br />&nbsp; -Person is busted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Do the coins lead back to you? It would seem this would be the worst case scenario but very feasible given who uses tumbler services.<br /><br />I wonder if they can try the person with co-conspirating because it was the culprits BTCs<br /><br />Experts, what say you?

				I&#039;m definitely not an expect, but from what I understand, the source that you get your tumbled coins from is not singular, so this issue, while interesting hypothetically, probably wouldn&#039;t ever happen, I don&#039;t think. <br />

				Absolutely not. If you are worried deposit them on an exchange when you are done and sell them for cash. Wait, then buy them back. Good luck tracking that.

				Well how serious a hypothetical situation are we in here? <br /><br />I suppose if you&#039;re about to go down for treason or child trafficking based on your Bitcoin activity, there comes a point where you hold your hands up and say &#039;you know what, I tumbled my coins&#039;.

Dunno, but it would probably be a bitch process.<br /><br />Also, this is 100% hypothetical, but raises questions on BTC tumbling security as I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s a go-to strategy for many big buyers and vendors.

				The whole point of tumblers is to anonymize your coins. If hypohetically you ended up with some pedo&#039;s coins through a tubling service, there should be no way to tell who&#039;s coins belong to who. <br /><br />But I&#039;m not exactly an expert. This is just my understanding of the service tublers offer
