				There is a small independently owned retail shop near my house which will lease you a mailbox within the store for a small price per month<br />They receive usps ups fedex dhl etc but are not in any way affiliated with the USPS. You come to pick up your packages from the counter 9-5 mon-fri<br /><br />I am not sure of what sort of ID (if any) is required to rent a mailbox<br />My only other way to receive mail is through a USPS lock/key mail unit on my street that is tied to my home address<br /><br />I know the general attitudes towards receiving packages through the usps(used to ship myself oz of mj cross country vac sealed with oven bags).. but my current situation dictates receipt of smaller but more precious cargo (seeds, pills, blotter, liquids) for my good times<br /><br /><br />After writing this it kind of seems glaringly obvious that I should use the indy shop for a box... but I would like to gain the consensus of the community to how you guys would approach my situation

				USPS to your address seems the most risky but imo is hassle free and you still have deny-ability if you were somehow magically caught by any authority. Someone you don&#039;t know trying to set you up, etc.<br /><br />Getting the mailbox at the local place would require a good fake ID and now you&#039;re talking mail fraud.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had no problems with USPS sending my drugs right to my door to my name

				I&#039;d go with USPS or home address. At first I&#039;d buy a few things off of eBay and send them to your box, so that that&#039;s your claim as to why you have the box if anybody asks. The Constitutional protection against USPS searching your packages is very helpful.

I have an aunt that mailed me some over the counter pills in a zip lock bag before, just because she had way way too many, and when i received the box, it was torn down the middle and crudely taped together. I assumed they busted open my box but never asked the aunt.<br /><br /><br />on subject though... i would think you would have the same chances sending it either to the store or your house.

				In the US it&#039;s federal law that you have two forms of ID to open a mailbox, one needs to be government issued and have a picture. Yet another thing you can thank the Patriot Act for. As long as its shipped via USPS it&#039;s still federal mail and you need a warrant to open it, regardless of where it&#039;s delivered.
