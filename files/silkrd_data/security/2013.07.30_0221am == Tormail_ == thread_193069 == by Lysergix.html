				Is tormail down right now? Have been trying all day....<br /><br />I feel like this is a question that would get asked all the time, but couldn&#039;t find any recent posts so posted, because this is frustrating....

				Yeah it&#039;s been fucked for about the past 12 hours. At least it&#039;s been pretty stable for about a couple of months until today. I remember when it was down for days on end back in April. Same with SR.

Shit like having PGP keys with clearnet email addresses listed, thing in listings and forum postings that can clearly be linked to Facebook and Twitter, people posting their *private* PGP keys here, and so many who never use any encryption whatsoever. Some people NEVER use encryption with Tormail. I shit you not. Because it&#039;s, you know, anonymous lol<br /><br />So believe me, if Tormail were a honeypot quite a few people would&#039;ve been busted already. Maybe I overstated things by saying SR would have been shut down by now, but you definitely would have read about a lot of busts off of here. With some of the dumb things done all the time, it would be like taking candy from a fucking baby. If it were a honeypot.
