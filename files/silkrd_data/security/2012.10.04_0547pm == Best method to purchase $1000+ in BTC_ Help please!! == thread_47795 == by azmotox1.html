				Hey guys I am very new to this and am looking to invest over $1000 here in the next month, what methods do you prefer for converting this into BTC? So far I have only used the bitinstant to instawallet method and it&#039;s pretty expensive. Any advice is much appreciated!!<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Bitinstant is going to be your best bet - it really isn&#039;t that expensive for the convenience and it&#039;s extremely easy. There are some trusted vendors that will do other methods that COULD potentially cost you less.. but it&#039;s your call.<br /><br />Also, you can send the funds straight to your SR bitcoin address and skip the instawallet step all together. Just our 2c. :D<br />.Hades.

				I guess you&#039;re right for the convenience bitinstant is probably worth it. I feel like there is some money to be saved through vendors but then again it might be less trustworthy. <br /><br />If you sent it straight to your SR account you would compromise your security wouldn&#039;t you??

				Buying coins from a vendor is the easiest way to buy coins IMO also leaves no paper trail if you do it the way i do :P The only way i have bought them is with MoneyPak 2 BTC, but my go to guy BTCmaster isn&#039;t doing Moneypaks atm but that should be back up shortly.&nbsp; All the money you see in my transaction list came from him hahaha. He&#039;s 100% straight, he will take care of you. <br /><br />Here&#039;s his URL-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/7bdda04d8b<br /><br /><br />Best Regards<br />Flylo

Besides, the address on your SR account isn&#039;t actually YOUR address that you could be identified by. Just as bitcoins in your SR account don&#039;t actually STAY in that account. SR accepts bitcoins for you and just credits your account as a variable in their database - this is how you can instantly send coins from one account to another.<br /><br />Plus, you should &quot;get a new address&quot; every so often anyway! :D<br />.Hades.

				From what I understood BTCmaster charges Market Price+$1 which is about 10% and chroniccrew charged 5%, does anyone know what bitinstant charges? My last transaction there was only $1.37 fee I thought. Aren&#039;t these vendors supposed to be cheaper?

				MP to BTC.&nbsp; There are a couple good vendors on here.&nbsp; It costs more...but is the easiest and most anonymous I think.
