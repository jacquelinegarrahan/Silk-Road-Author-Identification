				I&#039;m sorry in advance because I know this must have been answered many imes before but I can&#039;t seem to find the info. If somebody could direct me to the resource it would be so helpful.<br /><br />I have btc in my account and I want to be able to send them directly to a vendor (I didn&#039;t have enough for the next size purchase but he said he&#039;s happy to supplement my order with whatever extra btc I had). He said just to send it over which is where I&#039;m confused.<br /><br />On his page he has the PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK. Basically all I&#039;m asking though is this:<br /><br />???How can I send him money direct from my account to his when all I can see on his end is his PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK???<br /><br />Again, sorry if the question has been asked a million times. I really did try to find it myself before posting.<br /><br />Thanks!

				You just need to send it from SR under &quot;account&quot; ---- use the &quot;send to user&quot; blank and put the vendor&#039;s username in.

				I figured it would be something simple but not that simple. I&#039;ve been to that page so many times I&#039;m not sure how I always missed that. <br /><br />Thanks for the reply, everything worked perfectly of course :-)

				Have the vendor create you a custom for ad for the exact amount that you own. It will keep in in escrow, and lowers the chance of you getting ripped off.
