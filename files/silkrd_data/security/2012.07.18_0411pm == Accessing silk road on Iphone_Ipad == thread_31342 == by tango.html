				Just curious if this is possible and safe to do so?<br /><br />I downloaded a tor browser for iphone called Covert Browser, it lets me browser the forums and get to the login page for silk road, but when i put my details in, it just goes to a blank screen.<br /><br /><br />Has anyone had any other luck or opinions on security and safety of using an iphone/ipad to access tor?<br /><br />Thanks

				I&#039;m actually using OnionBrowser which you can download from Installous: you&#039;ll need to jailbreak your device.&nbsp; It works great, everything seems to work on SilkRoad.&nbsp; TorMail also works, even though you&#039;ll be forced to use the non-JavaScript web client.&nbsp; If your device isn&#039;t jailbroken, I don&#039;t know what could eventually work, CovertBrowser is the only Tor-based browser on the AppStore I&#039;ve heard of.

				They do not protect your privacy anymore then Tor alone.<br /><br />Covert browser does not let me log in. It logs in and then never refreshes.<br /><br />Onion browser - works, but god forbid you exit it out to do something else for a moment or to look something up. once you come back its dead. gotta actually close the app via the &quot;task man&quot; then reopen it from scratch. still a pretty big pain, but does in fact work.<br /><br />

				You should do searches for other posts on this. Don&#039;t go crazy with orders using your iDevivice, and use a ip/anonymity check to see how secure you are. I have logged onto tor nodes before but it&#039;s a very rare occurrence.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />Now that it comes to mind (should&#039;ve mentioned this before) you defiantly should use wifi (not your own), that really seemed to help.

				Buying droogs?<br /><br />There&#039;s an app for that!<br /><br />But seriously Apple are the worst violators of privacy ever. Run running a virtual machine software from your iPad or Mac and then the TBB from that (all on some kind of portable storage like MicroSD or a mini USB or an Ironkey if there&#039;s a suitable one for Mac). Access the network via private SSL bridges so your ISP can&#039;t see your traffic. Don&#039;t sacrifice convenience for security. SR is like Amazon.com, but it is not Amazon.com.

				&quot;Access the network via private SSL bridges so your ISP can&#039;t see your traffic. Don&#039;t sacrifice convenience for security.&quot;<br /><br />I believe it does that just not as well. I believe if you use it through public (open) wifi it helps you to stay hidden better. But not only all the above that has been mentioned, when using tor you need to take a WHOLE different approach to internet use. ;D

Your cell company wont know &quot;anything more&quot; then your Home/Business ISP &quot;knows&quot; when you use Tor. Not to beat a dead horse, but &quot;you are anon&quot; as long as&nbsp; there isnt someother funky ish going on. What do I mean? Well java script is known to be an ip snitch. In otherwords you can be running Tor all day, there are some know java scripts that can &quot;leak&quot; your &quot;real&quot; ip even with Tor running.<br /><br />@Whothefuckisthis - While I have never used JohnDoe or JonDonym or whatever it is called. I was referring to the use of a private/dedicated VPN tunnel.<br /><br />@Everyone - a dedicated/private VPN will give you a dedicated pipe to/from the &quot;provider&quot; (usually another country). after this link is established, you then Tor. If any IP were to be &quot;leaked&quot; you leak the IP of your VPN. Not to mention you gain total encryption. end point to end point.<br /><br />Normally you pay for these VPN services, but they are affordable enough as to give no one an excuse not to add it to thier tool belt.<br /><br />Remember &quot;being secure&quot; in not just one thing. Security is all about layers.<br /><br />Now I have used the &quot;Onion browser&quot; through a VPN before, but it still falls short as mentioned in my first post.

				Covert Browser is nice to browse the forums, but I think it&#039;s lacking cookie support which means you can&#039;t login to SR, or the forums, or even do a search. Thankfully, this also means it&#039;s not really storing any cookie data locally so your iDevice will be cleanish. <br /><br />If your going to break the law and buy drugs online though, I think it&#039;s worth the effort to drag your ass off the couch and pickup your laptop or use your desktop and use your PGP tools etc. I wouldn&#039;t risk such activities on closed-eco system apple stuff. They&#039;ve already been busted logging GPS data, and your device has a unique UID. Just don&#039;t do it. <br /><br />Also, If you use a computer with an SSD drive, wiping data off is more secure also and won&#039;t leave info that can be recovered like on magnetic drives. <br /><br />Hope that helps. <br /><br />

				I use &quot;Onion Browser&quot; on my iPhone it works fine; I&#039;m using it now. It can be very slow sometimes.<br />As for as apple being able to update your OS without your knowledge this seems unlikely. Firmware updates take quite a while and involve shutting down the phone. If like me your iPhone is jail broken you can block updates anyway. ( I do this so I don&#039;t accidentally update to a new firmware and lose my jailbreak, pretty unlikely but now impossible)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In many threads on this subject, noone has been able to give any convincing reason why accessing TOR from a cellphone is in itself less secure than a laptop, for example using a 3G dongle.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not saying there aren&#039;t risks but I wish someone with this knowledge could give me some solid facts rather than just saying &quot;ooh sounds risky I wouldn&#039;t if I were you&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway you can also use GPG on an iPhone if it&#039;s jailbroke. You need Mobile Terminal and iFile. I have stored all the basic commands as shortcuts in MT. I am always careful to wipe all keys between used tho. The main risk I can see is leaving evidence such as this if your phone is ever seized by LE with the technical competence to find it.<br /><br />Here is a brief guide I posted:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27442.msg299005#msg299005<br />

				There is now actually a decent PGP app on appstore... Can&#039;t recall it&#039;s name just now.... not tried it but it looks ok. It didnt have PGP or GPG in its name so I cant search it.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t used it but it looked better than the other offerings. I am surprised there aren&#039;t more front ends on iPhone.

				I have not seen PGP/GPG in the iphone. Im going to look again now. :)<br /><br />but there is a TrueCrypt app. Call something like &quot;CryptVault&quot; or something like that. If Im wrong and someone can&#039;t find it, I&#039;ll get the real app name.<br /><br />I do not use it for SR. I been using encryption far longer then that. The app is written by just one guy and it IS good and all. The only short coming that I see is that you must name your True Crypt volume with a file extention of .fc in order for the app to &quot;see&quot; it.<br /><br /><br />I dont like that.<br />

				Yeah I have definitely see pgp like opengp have not see a truecrypt app. I take it that it would not provide full disk but let you encrypt things in a app? But I use onion browser on iPhone. Works great but I really need to quit this habit because its really not good security wise. <br /><br /><br />Cops can crack iOS in like seconds and apple would be happy to help if needed (fucking apple lol always seems to bend over backwards for LE). Anyway there&#039;s another good app called ishredder that will securely wipe your free space which is alway good if your doing things on the iPhone.

				I created a step-by-step guide on how to install Mobile Tor and configure everything in iOS. You must have a jailbroken iOS device for this to work. This allows you to route traffic for all applications over the Tor network. This can allow you to use other applications such as IRC client etc over Tor and not just a web browser like you are limited to with the Onion Browser application.<br /><br />http://x35jfacrznhhtrfr.onion/tutorials/tor-ios/

				Seems like I tried iPGMail and there were some issues with it, but I personally use oPenGP for iOS. It is $1 more than iPGMail, but it&#039;s well worth it as I haven&#039;t had a single problem with it yet!

				Its displaying that on the Google Results because the Google robot that scanned that page and cached it wasn&#039;t using Tor.&nbsp; You enable Tor in SBSettings and turned on the HTTP proxy?

Is that right?<br />
