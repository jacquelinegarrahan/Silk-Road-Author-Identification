				I was looking through my account info nd I noticed that you could get a new btc address. I was thinking it would be a good idea to do this so you could remain anonymous through out all of your purchases. Let me know what you guys think about this.

I know of BitCoinFog which is public, there are also a few others. Using multiple wallets isn&#039;t really a good method for scrubbing your coins. You should obtain them as anonymously as possible, as well as scrub to be the most safe.<br /><br />The fact SR keeps the addresses active presents a very large problem if the SR server is ever compromised, they can easily link BTC Address-&gt;UserName.
