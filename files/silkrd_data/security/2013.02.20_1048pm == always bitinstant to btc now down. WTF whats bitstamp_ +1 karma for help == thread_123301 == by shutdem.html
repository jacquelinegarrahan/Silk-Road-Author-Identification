				The bitinstant problem is temporary (aren&#039;t we talking about the same exact thing on another thread?).&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitstamp is a BTC exchange service, like Mt. Gox, only not retarded.&nbsp; You deposit USD, and then trade USD for BTC.&nbsp; You can then sent BTC to another address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bitfloor is another such service.&nbsp; I like that one better because it&#039;s US-based, and works with Bank of America.&nbsp; All you need for an account is an email address.&nbsp; To do a deposit, you just tell bitfloor how much, and they give you an account number.&nbsp; You walk into a Bank of America, fill out a deposit slip (you don&#039;t need a bank account), and your money&#039;s there the same day.&nbsp; Then, it&#039;s just like Gox or bitstamp.&nbsp; Trade USD&gt;BTC and transfer to SR.

				i think it&#039;s<br /><br />https://www.bitstamp.net<br />NOT&nbsp; (dot)com<br /><br />I tried it today. super easy. Wired the money at a local supermarket to a company, Bitstamp credited my bitstamp acct with USD, then I bought BTC with those USD and transferred them this way. Nothing here yet, but waiting on coin sometimes takes hours. whateva<br /><br />EDIT: BST seems legit. Maybe I&#039;ll try that next time they&#039;re available.

				BST wont be able to help you tonight.<br /><br />1:I emailed him last night with the amount of cash I had and my BTC address<br /><br />2: This morning he emailed me his BOA account number and told me a specific amount to deposit, for tracking purposes.<br /><br />3: Make the deposit with cash, no ID or personaly identafiable information, keep reciept.<br /><br />4: Get confirmation email and check BTC wallet for coins.<br /><br />You can do it outside of SR, but I &quot;purchased&quot; a listing just so I could leave feedback. <br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />GT

				I&#039;m doing a order through Ziggap.com with a Chase bank cash deposit -&gt; BTC address. I&#039;m going to make the cash deposit here in about an hour when the branch opens.&nbsp; They also take MG, WU but they say it can take up to 3 days to confirm those payments, while a Chase bank deposit is almost instant.

Bitinstant still sets it up for you, but instead of directing the money to BITCOIN ADDRESS, you direct it to YOUR BITSTAMP ID NUMBER. you have to have a bitstamp account, though (with the fake info you just used for your moneygram thing). This step will take 4% from you, the normal bitinstant fee + 3.95 for moneygram.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve done the whole moneygram thing at walmart or whatever, you have money in your bitstamp account. Use that money to buy coins. This step has no fees.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve bought bitcoins on your bitstamp account, you can send them directly to your bitcoin address - this step only has a 0.5% fee.

				<br />This is a changing landscape, folks.&nbsp; Looking at the history, Bitfloor used to accept deposits from WellsFargo, but that ended last year for whatever reason.&nbsp; Every now and again, all of these services get hacked or otherwise digitally attacked, and outages ensue.&nbsp; Then, new services pop in and out (cryptocurrent - coming soon to a browser near you).<br /><br />There are so many scammers, at least there are a few companies doing it right.&nbsp; And, as far as Bitinstant goes, eventually they&#039;ll start doing transfers to BTC addys again.&nbsp;

				Well it was more of a careless error on my part.&nbsp; I had about $900 deposited and when I went to trade for BTC, the asking price was at a nice $26.xx. So when I hit &#039;buy&#039; I didn&#039;t even read the pop-up asking if that price was okay and I just clicked confirm or whatever it asks.&nbsp; Turns out at that instant, the price somehow jumped to $34.99 for literally 2 seconds and thats the price I got them at. Ended up losing a good $200+ <br /><br />So lesson here, when a confirmation pop-up appears, don&#039;t rush it and make sure you are okay with the price!<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=123301.msg847644#msg847644">Quote from: ChemCat on February 21, 2013, 08:33 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=123301.msg847615#msg847615">Quote from: camomug on February 21, 2013, 08:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Bitfloor is my go to choice for deposits now.&nbsp; I two BoA within a 4 mile radius so I like to switch it up after every other purchase.&nbsp; My first deposit I f*cked up pretty bad (my fault, when buying BTC) but everytime after that has been flawless<br /><br />If there&#039;s a Chase nearby, I would recommend bitme.&nbsp; The only thing I don&#039;t like is that there&#039;s a $500 weekly limit and you have to send a copy of your receipt to their support.&nbsp; Also, it takes a bit longer than bitfloor for your funds to show up.&nbsp; But other than that, I haven&#039;t had any problems<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />hiya comomug&nbsp; :)<br /><br />well tell me how ya fucked up so we dont make those same mistakes&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <br /><br />if you will, Please<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Bitinstants site now shows NO reserves with BTC-e and Bitstamp and bitstamp has been removed from the to dropdown box.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also if you look at the bitinstant thread at bitcointalk.com you will see how many people are waiting for funds on orders going back for weeks with the newest ones being bitinstant -&gt; bitstamp.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recomend using bitinstant for anything right now.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS:<br />My Ziggap.com Chase bank -&gt; BTC address just went through.&nbsp; So total time from deposit to coins was 4 hours, which I&#039;m ok with as this is the first time I have used them and bitinstant being shit.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				i haven&#039;t used bitfloor yet, but I&#039;m going too.&nbsp; Thanks SleepyEyes for all the good info!<br /><br />Do be advised that&nbsp; you have to check a box that says you will provide a government issued ID if requested (to register at bitfloor).&nbsp; <br />That always makes me a little nervous.&nbsp; But I guess in that case, you just say you don&#039;t have it and if they don&#039;t fund your payment, just leave. <br /><br />

				ziggap worked just fine alto the rate they charge for the bit coins is a BIT higher than the going rate<br /><br />SR says 39.333 a bit coin, he charged me 42 something... but hey, I found a solution to no bitinstant. I set up an email for it to send confirmations to and they send an email when the money is picked up and credited to your wallet<br /><br />It worked flawlessly. <br /><br />EXCEPT...I can see it in blockchain but not on SR (9 confirmations)....weird
