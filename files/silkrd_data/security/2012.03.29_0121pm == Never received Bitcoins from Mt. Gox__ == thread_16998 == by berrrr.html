				I had just bought some Bitcoins on Mt. Gox and went to the funding options tab and withdrew bitcoins. Copied and pasted the address on my account page from SR. 6 hours later and there are no new coins in my account. I&#039;m starting to worry that I lost 20 bitcoins..and I don&#039;t even know how... I know SR&nbsp; says &quot;please wait a few hours&quot; but I&#039;ve never had it take this long. Is there anything I can do, or am I screwed?&nbsp; :-[

				I used to think this every time I funded my SR account. lol<br /><br />Although it never quite took six hours, it definitely takes a while, like 2-3 hours at least. If you&#039;re a first time user or using a newly-generated btc address, that could be the reason why it&#039;s taking unusually long this time.

Gox before, and it&#039;s always taken&nbsp; about 2-3 hours, which is why I&#039;m kind of freaking out. It&#039;s also a btc address I&#039;ve used before. Mt. Gox lists the transaction though. I guess all I can do is wait it out. Thanks for the response. <br /><br />

				I dunno... 24+ hours and still no coins. What&#039;s going on?! I&#039;m really beginning to be convinced that I got screwed over, but I have no idea what went wrong.

				It&#039;s now going on 72 hours and I still haven&#039;t gotten the damn things. How can they just not send it and claim they did? Is it a problem with Mt Gox or SR? This is such crap...&nbsp; Could it be possible it&#039;s just taking them a really long damn time or do you think I am not going to get them if I haven&#039;t gotten them by now?

				after Mt.Gox locked my account and held my money/BTC until I &quot;Verified&quot; with them, I was somehow able to get all my money/BTC out of there the other night for some reason without Verifying. Will never use them again.<br /><br />first TradeHill, then risky and high fees to use BTC Vendors on SR, the only thing left for me now is to look into bitinstant (sp) or was it Get-Bitcoins (?) that a lot of people have been recommending to me lately. This one better last longer than the others with fewer problems as my options are running quite thin these days...<br /><br /><br />fuck Mt.Cocks
