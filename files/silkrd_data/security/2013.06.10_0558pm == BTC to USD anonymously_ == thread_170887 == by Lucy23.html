				Im starting to receive large amounts (less than 80k a year) in BTC and I&#039;ve read through the forums, searched for advice but have not really gotten anything that seems to be worth while other than &#039;buy a fake identity and open a bank account&#039;.<br /><br />Im trying to not commit fraud on top of selling on here and would like some vendor input on how you can &#039;cash out&#039; without sending it to a exchange and creating paper trail for this amount of money.<br /><br />If anyone could please message me with helpful advice I would be so appreciative (the kind where when my business gets going I reward you wink wink)<br /><br />I was told this site &quot;http://mst2qwqxshn53jrr.onion.to/&quot; is a scam (found it on the hidden wiki).<br />Im curious about this site &quot;https://moneypaktrader.com/?m=homepage&quot; which is a vendor that I found on the money/services section of SR that offers escrow.<br /><br />Im abit scared to be giving people my personal information for btc through SR, especially &#039;cash to mailbox&#039; as that seems very dangerous. Do you guys recommend any vendors that load money paks through SR? My feeling is some of these might be LE in attempts to compromise identity.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.<br /><br />Lucy

				I have sold bitcoins on ebay and it works very well, the money can be either transferred to a bank account of your choice or spent online via paypal

				I&#039;d stay away from paypal, everything to and from this place is written down and authenticated. It would be nice to stay out of the US (and the most kiss ass governments to the US). Be nice if you could go by &#039;character&#039;, people who were happy with the service like SR. <br />I haven&#039;t used it, but&nbsp; there is something called local bit coins (this is at least in the US) where you can check the person&#039;s reputation, then do the plan over email, and finally show up and do the transfer. Seems if you were careful, that this would work. &#039;Careful&#039; means different things to different people, though.

				If you were trying to cash out you&#039;d go to some place public (so you don&#039;t get physically robbed) each would have a laptop, go through some &#039;public&#039; internet (Starbucks) and just have the guy hand money to you before you did the electronic &#039;irreversible&#039; btc transfer. I&#039;d get money in hand, check to make sure it&#039;s real, and THEN do the transfer. <br />I don&#039;t think buying or selling btc is illegal. I wouldn&#039;t say or do anything that would incriminate you-telling the guy anything, or the guy telling you something incriminating and still doing the deal. I&#039;d do something like a few 1-2-3 btc deals to get the &#039;hang&#039; of it first, before doing a 10 or 20 (or more) btc deal. <br />Due diligence.

				You might have to wait a few minutes to have each party be happy that the btc transfer had gone smoothly. That means that you feel good with the person you&#039;re doing business with, any &#039;gut&#039; feelings and I&#039;d call it off. &#039;I must be coming down with something, don&#039;t feel good, gotta go&#039;&#039;.
