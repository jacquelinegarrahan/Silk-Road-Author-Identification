				Only if they could log in to your account, because you keep your log in details in a text file on the hard drive, for example.<br /><br />Tor Browser doesn&#039;t save stuff in a cache on disk, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking.<br />

				Your login details will be on your hard drive if you personally saved them there. Tor Browser doesn&#039;t save your login details to disk. The &quot;Remember passwords for sites&quot; option is even disabled in Preferences -&gt; Security.<br />

				Your biggest danger is getting busted while logged in, they won&#039;t need your password then.<br />Set your laptop up so it switches itself off after xx minutes of inactivity, and set a password to start it again. Don&#039;t have it set to hibernate or sleep.

				Think about what you&#039;re asking here. Unless you get busted smoking a joint sitting on a bench in front of the police station while surfing SR, why would LE even know you own a computer? Unless you&#039;re a big time dealer, you&#039;re not getting raided.

				are you implying that you stored your pass/login on a text file and then deleted the txt file? <br /><br />and now you&#039;re worried if that txt file containing login/pass could be traced after deletion
