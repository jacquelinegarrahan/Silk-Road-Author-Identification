				Long post. *uk* lol...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />So, I&#039;ve got myself a dropbox, with fake details. The great part is that the only comms between them and me is electronic. Email (hidden) and SMS. (throw-away payg). <br /><br />Now I need to pay for it, various tariffs available, pay per drop, monthly, annually etc... <br /><br />They acccept online payment via MasterCard, Maestro and VISA. <br /><br /><br />What I&#039;m looking for, is an anomymous virtual creditcard, obviously I&#039;d match the fake name on this with the dropbox details.<br />They just need the usual info. cc number, exp date, cvv, card holder&#039;s name.<br /><br />They take a mandatory £2 payment via worldpay for &#039;verification&#039;. <br /><br />After that, the same card is debited automatically for each delivery, and an SMS is sent to say the package is ready. <br /><br />Taking a risk on bymybox systems. Scanners, inspections, etc..&nbsp; So first package will be a test - just some patacetamol in a jiffy bag.<br /><br />Box pin number written on a £20 note. &quot;officer, this guy down the street offered me £20 to go pick up his pack. Thick pikey accent, couldn&#039;t really understand him but I could do with £20 blah blah.....&quot; <br /><br />Box is anon.<br />Card is anon.<br />No proof it&#039;s mine. <br /><br />I&#039;m talking about my.bybox.com <br /><br />Recently brought up by another helpful soul on SR. I think this is a viable delivery option, and I can do the whole thing anonymously, as long as I can get a PRE-LOADED card. ie, money already on it when I buy it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got various digital currencies I can pay with. <br /><br /><br />Who can help? There seems to be a billion sites out there offering anonymous virtual cards with balances, but I don&#039;t want a skimmed card or anything like that, I just need some info on legitimate virtual card sellers.<br /><br />Info, pointers, greatly appreciated.

He offers anonymous physical cards and anonymous virtual cards, and also offers a loading service.

				Great, great, great to know.&nbsp; Thanks all for this thread, and +1 to graham.&nbsp; I was just reading a wiki involving VCCs, and you never know how old the info is sometimes, whether the technology or techniques are dated (used to be able to fund BTCs with PP, for example).&nbsp; Brilliant.
