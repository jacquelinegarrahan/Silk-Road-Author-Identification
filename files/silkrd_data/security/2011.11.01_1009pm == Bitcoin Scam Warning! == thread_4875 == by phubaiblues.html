				Lately, about once a day, we get a new bitcoin seller.&nbsp; They also get a few buyer accounts, and immediately post glowing positive feedback about their transactions.&nbsp; Quit being naive, and giving away your money.&nbsp; Use an outside exchange, like get-bitcoin.com, or mtgox, or tradehill, or at least someone who has been around awhile.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting tired of seeing &quot;Oh I got ripped last week by &quot;fill in the blank&quot; ..... it&#039;s just stupid.<br /><br />Reputable btc sellers aren&#039;t coming here: it&#039;s just a daily scam we can&#039;t yet prevent.&nbsp; Don&#039;t buy it.&nbsp; I know getting btc is one of the hassles on here: we all go thru it...and we don&#039;t get ripped.&nbsp; This site is based on escrow, not somebody saying how honest they are.&nbsp; BTC sellers don&#039;t provide escrow, naturally, so avoid them...quit giving away money!

				I couldn&#039;t agree more.&nbsp; To anyone new that&#039;s reading this think twice about getting your btc here, there&#039;s just no risk for the scammer and it&#039;s easy money for them!&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to point any fingers but it looks like sugar mama may be the newest btc vendor and anyone using her should tread verrry carefully.

				Even if&nbsp; you do find a legit btc for moneypak vendor you are still paying a premium for the service. Sometimes over 20% for something you could do for %5 through get-bitcoin.com. I know that buying with moneypak seems easier and more convenient and doesn&#039;t force you to learn anything about btc or how to safely navigate SR and related websites, but DAMN people. You are only doing yourself a disservice and taking a HUGE risk on getting scammed out of your hard earned drug money. Be smart, be safe.

				As far as using MP to purchase BTC I would highly suggest checking out bitcoin-otc. There&#039;s definitely a bit to learn at first but once you get the hang of it, it&#039;s very easy to find an honest person who will exchange with you and for much better rates than exchanging MP through SR. Also their web of trust makes it hard to get ripped off if you&#039;re being smart.

				Is there really that much of a demand? I wouldn&#039;t mind being an exchanger, but I&#039;m in Canada and there are no moneypak retailers in Canada AFAIK so how would I turn the moneypak into cash?
