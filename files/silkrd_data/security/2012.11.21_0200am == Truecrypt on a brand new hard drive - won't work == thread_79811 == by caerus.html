				I was wondering if anybody might have a solution. <br /><br />So, I bought a brand new hard drive. SATA, 320GB. Installed a fresh non-pirated official Windows 7. After installing some basic programs started Truecrypt Hidden OS Wizard. After going just fine through all the steps and putting some sensitive-looking non-incriminating data on the outer volume it reboots and starts cloning Windows. At about 15% spits out an error and shuts down. I tried FAT16, FAT32 even NTSF, DBANed the hard drive, making a fresh install every time. Haven&#039;t tried with Ubuntu yet, but I&#039;m about to give up considering that each time I try I have to spend at least 5 hours just to go back where I began. Can it be a hardware compatibility issue? Did anybody here experience a similar problem?

				You told us nothing<br /><br />- what&#039;s the error<br />- 64 bit O/S and 64 bit TC version?<br />- did you try just regular full disc encryption instead of making hidden partition after it failed?<br /><br />I&#039;m betting you made the outer partition too small, and when you moved files into it that fucked up the inside partition so it can&#039;t boot. Don&#039;t fuck around with outer paritions :) Make them then add like a small text file or something. I gave my outer partition once like 2G playroom and yet it still corrupted the inside &quot;hidden&quot; partition when I moved some small files to it. <br /><br />TC only makes containers on linux(ubuntu), you use LUKS to do full disc encryption

				Disk Read Error is a dreaded Windows 7 problem, usually a bad sector, nobody actually knows why this happens. Google it everybody seems to have this issue sooner or later.<br /><br />I would just encrypt the entire drive, because you should always do that regardless, then for your evil business start up a linux .iso in virtualbox, save it as a snapshot, then encrypt the snapshot files and .VDI virtual hard drive with TC using plausible deniability containers, so if you&#039;re forced to decrypt, they get nothing. <br /><br />You should also read the truecrypt documentation about wear leveling devices (flash, SSD, USB drives) basically it says don&#039;t do this because confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=wear-leveling <br />
