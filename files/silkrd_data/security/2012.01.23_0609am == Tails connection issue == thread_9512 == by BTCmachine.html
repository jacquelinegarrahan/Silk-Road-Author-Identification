				Hey all, <br /><br />Ive been using SR for quite some time now and with my criminal history and knowledge feel like tails on a USB which can easily be tossed away is the best way to keep myself from anything linking me to the Silk Road<br /><br />However ive got a question regarding connectivity, currently I am on tor via netbook and was able to connect instantly but whenever i am running tails from USB it has insane trouble connecting for the past 2 days i actually thought SR was gone because i wasnt able to connect<br /><br />does anyone have any idea what the issue is and if it is fixable? I can connect sometimes but this is rare, <br /><br />Is liberte linux any better? i was thinking of using this next to see which one compares, <br /><br />thanks in advance to anyone who gets back to me any information is greatly appreciated

				Hey There, <br />I&#039;ve been doing a lot of reading lately and have discovered that tails is NOT what you want to be running for this purpose. Liberte Linux is your best bet. <br />As for tails I also have had several connection issues, I&#039;m betting that your problem is that Tails is not syncing its clock to the network or that the sync fails. I&#039;m not sure why this happens but when it happens to me I just reboot until tails syncs up.&nbsp; Once it successfully syncs tor will start up successfully. When it doesn&#039;t sync tor gets stuck on &quot;Loading authority certificates&quot; or something like that.<br />Anyways to be honest I do not know nearly enough about this to really be giving you advice, I&#039;ve just had a similar problem. I strongly suggest you check out this thread,&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8970.0, it will describe why Tails is no good, why Liberte is better, and where and how to set everything up.<br /><br />Good luck!
