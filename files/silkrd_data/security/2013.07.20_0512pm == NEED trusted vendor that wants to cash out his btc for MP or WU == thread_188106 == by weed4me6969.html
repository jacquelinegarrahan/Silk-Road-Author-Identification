				Hey guys!&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone knew of any trusted vendors that sell the bitcoins that they make at a very low or no fee.&nbsp; I really am interested in finding a legit vendor that i can consistently do this with....Considering I find myself going through just too much hassle every single weed to get rather large amounts of bitcoin. <br /><br />If anyone could suggest anyone or if you are that vendor, let me know, or shoot me a pm.<br /><br />Thanks Guys!

				This is sooooo f$%&amp;*#@ lame!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; I cant believe it is this damn hard to find btc for low or no fee&#039;s!!!&nbsp; And yeah some people say they can do it, but it is the vendors that are new, or are charging too much!<br /><br />Cmon guys, help a brotha out!&nbsp; It just sucks sooo bad when you are trying to do this cuz it is cheaper, but it will still end up being the same, due to all fee&#039;s, and time delay... it is just crazy!!&nbsp; I am hoping sooooo badly for a very trusted vendor to pm me and sell me like $850 in coinage.&nbsp;
