				Hi everyone.<br /><br />I have found some nice thing recently. There is new bitcoin exchange bitcurex.com, but they have lounched the anon debit cards. with IBAN account and all the stuff needed to cashout PP, they probably dont know how someone can use it :D and they are quite cheap. <br />I have ordered some of them and they are working excellent. you can get it at shop.bitcurex.com. The process is quite anonymous, you just have to buy max 2 cards at a time, so you will have unregistered postal shipping, more than 2 is registered shipping, I was managed to make 4 separate orders for 2 cards and the order went just fine :)<br />Anyway also there is some kind of shop, 6qgubmttwqthdjzn.onion someone selling them on tor, anonymously, cant confirm is it legit yet, but credentials seems ok to me.<br /><br />If you feel like donating me for these info, feel free:<br />18UrspHRxZ3aVJMFWpHvo5bNxq4G4qsxG3

				This reminds me of previous scams on the net where a scammer creates a thread and the scammer enforces the OP with positively to lure people in.

				Just stick with what works and we KNOW is legit, stop being so lazy people :P. I wish we could all just buy bitcoins and sell them via CC&#039;s, PayPal, etc, but that isn&#039;t the case so just suck it up and use bitinstant or moneypak ;D

				Yea, the exchange looks a little funny.&nbsp; Anyone could have made a site with graphics and prices, but the types of cards explained here are legit.&nbsp; I could sell one for $60 for you to use if you like.&nbsp; Maybe the exchange is real, idk... but the cards are being done and they are successful.&nbsp; Annon IBAN debit cards - real deal - $60.

				I will agree with everyone in that the site does look a little phishy. But I thought that I mine as well try it because if it is legit, this would be a great way to cash out. So far I have made an account and put a couple bitcoins on the site and so far no one has scammed me. I am now attempting to sell my bitcoins. <br /><br />The only problem about the site so far is that there aren&#039;t too many people on it yet. Theres only 3 people on right now haha. And there weighted averages are behind Mt. Gox. This kinda sucks for people that are sellling but right now it is great for people that want to buy. They are going for around 8 a bitcoin right now.<br /><br />I will keep you guys updated when I sell my bitcoins and get the anon debit card to see if it works.<br /><br />But so far it just looks like its a new market site that is run by non english speakers. I dont think this is a scam. Or maybe it is and I am just retarded. But its only a few bitcoins anyway

				It&#039;s a new (4 weeks old) Polish BTC exchange and I don&#039;t so far (after some research) think it&#039;s a scam either. I have put some btc there also and am checking things out.<br />

				Ya I dont know what Nero is talking about, this exchange is definitely legit but doesnt have many people that use it yet. But if you are looking for cheap coins, people are selling bitcoins for like 7 to 8 right now.
