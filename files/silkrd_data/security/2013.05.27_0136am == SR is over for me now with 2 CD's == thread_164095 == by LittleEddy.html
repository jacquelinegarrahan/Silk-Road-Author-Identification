				SR is over for me. fuk. I recently had 2 CD&#039;s (i.e., requiring my sigs) delivered. I wasn&#039;t too concerned for the first--it was a cIII and just thought the vendor was fukked up. The 2nd one occurred when I ordered some mj seeds. My wife signed for them (she&#039;s clueless).&nbsp; I knew then at this point that I was being targeted (as I contacted one vendor who denied reg&#039;ing a sig.) So now I&#039;m fukked. What&#039;s worse is that I currently have a couple of pending orders with some serious shit. I&#039;ve pm&#039;d them to cancel, but it&#039;s the end of the road for me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been around here for over a year and never had an issue until now. It&#039;s been good while it lasted. I have no idea how they pin pointed me either. I guess I&#039;m lucky they didn&#039;t have a warrant when the 2nd one was delivered. Now I&#039;m prepared. This is so fukked up....

				I wouldn&#039;t think that LE would dilly dally around with having you sign for a bunch of packages, rather just sign one and that&#039;s basically a confession and all they need to prosecute, someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong? Less time/money spent for them, they have no idea what packages *may* be coming in, before they reach customs or are sent domestically. I agree, it&#039;s pretty fishy that you&#039;d have to sign for 2 packages in a row, but what makes you think that you&#039;re off the hook if they are in fact on your case? I would still think about having your lawyers number on hand at all times, but I didn&#039;t think they would sit around and let you receive and enjoy your packages if they knew what was in them and had evidence/ probable cause. Then again, what do I know? Not very much, aside from if LE sees a drug deal go down, they apprehend the suspected dealer(s) and buyer(s) immediately.. I would think this would be the case for you. Best of luck to you and best wishes for you and your family.

				Hmm... I&#039;ve had the post office take it upon themselves to add signature requirements for international packages before. Were the packages of dom or intl origins?<br /><br />And everyones comments seem about right for a CD. I&#039;d think they&#039;d bust you right then &amp; there.

				Can&#039;t believe there&#039;d be a controlled delivery for some seeds or smallish quantities of anything for that matter. Most likely to be seized and with your name/address flagged. They&#039;ll build up intel before doing anything and surely they have bigger &#039;fish to fry&#039;. Probably vendor error. Reading different threads suggests it does happen.

				It was mentioned on another thread that USPS has changed the signature protocol for Priority mail (I think it was Priority) - apparently it used to be for the sender to check a box for signature on delivery, however this is now the default setting and delivery without a signature requires the box to be &#039;un-ticked&#039;. Can anyone else comment on this?<br /><br />If I&#039;m recalling this correctly it might explain why your deliveries are arriving with signature required.<br /><br /><br />I also agree that if LE was conducting a CD, they would have invited themselves in already. After all, if it is a CD and they leave you with the product and you consume it, hide it, relocate it ... where is the evidence for conviction? ;)<br /><br />PB.<br /><br />

				Having to sign for a package doesn&#039;t seem like a CD to me. I get a ton of legitimate parcels in the mail, and I often have to sign unexpectedly. I&#039;d say a CD is when you get busted, not when you have to sign for your parcel.

				It seems more like a Vendor error or something. I agree with all those that said the cops are not gonna let you enjoy your drugs. <br /><br />If it was INT Mail then sometimes regardless they will make u sign, Iv had many of things sent from a certain Place just reg mail, and unless it was expressed the post carrier would just leave it in the box, well one day the rotated shifts at the P O and i had to sign for a package that normally i had never signed for. <br /><br />Good thing to be cautious but i think your in the clear bro. Someone between SR and you Po fuked it up it seems.. <br /><br />Pot seeds ? Come on bro!

				Hello OP.<br /><br />Now chill, take a deep breath. You are not being controlled delivered :) I know this one thing for sure that tracked stuff ordered from the EU sometimes require a sig, even though this might not the be protocol within EU. <br /><br />If you were being targeted, you&#039;d been cuffed and SWAT would&#039;ve raided your house (possibly shot your dog :D) by now. <br />One thing I still do not understand about this American paranoia of signing for orders. If a tracked package that has your name on it is delivered to your house and requires a signiture, who the hell would turn it away and say they&#039;d haven&#039;t ordered anything? It could be a present? If that kind of prosecution evidence was valid in court, I&#039;d pack my shit and move to New Zealand straight away. Otherwise anyone could order a kilo of coke to someone&#039;s house they do not like and make sure the package requires a signiture, landing the enemy at least 10 years of sodomizing time in a private &quot;carehome&quot;.

				I don&#039;t think you got CD&#039;ed BUT i would still lay low for a little while just to make sure<br /><br />if it was seeds that you supposedly got CD&#039;ed for then could it be possible the police are waiting for you to plant the seeds before knocking down your door and thus making a stronger case?

				Those were not CD&#039;s. Let me paste something from a thread on Reddit:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For the past year, my cousin has been fighting an uphill battle against the state. He hasn&#039;t been sentenced yet, but according to the sentencing guidelines, he will get at least get 3-5 years. That&#039;s if he&#039;s lucky. I learned a lot through the process and sat through the trial. Here&#039;s what I found out about the legal system.<br />The prosecution does not have to prove you knew drugs were in your package. They just have to prove you knew you were in possession of the package and the packaged contained controlled substances. The burden of proof is on you to prove that you did not know the controlled substance in it. Nobody is going to believe that somebody ordered an expensive product in your name and you had no idea. Not signing for the package did not help at all.<br />You are expected to help the police arrest other people. Sentences can be reduced if you bring in 5 people to get yourself off. Most people take this route.<br />People still get arrested for possession. The police aren&#039;t only going after dealers, although that&#039;s who they prefer and who they want you to help them capture.<br />Police don&#039;t need a warrant to have drug dogs sniff packages at the post office and a hit on a package or packages from known drug trafficking locations is enough to sustain a warrant to search your house.<br />Everything can be paraphernalia. Even if it&#039;s just cash, you have to prove you obtained it legally to get it back.<br />This blew my mind. The jury verdict does not have to be unanimous. A majority vote can convict you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If they wanted to arrest you, they already would have.

				dude you&#039;re fine... seriously.&nbsp; don&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; vendors make mistakes sometimes, and lie to cover their asses, and sometimes they just honestly don&#039;t know what happened, a lot of the top vendors are actually crews of people of course and things can get very confusing.&nbsp; you aren&#039;t on a &quot;watch list&quot; (most likely), esp if you&#039;re just ordering SEEDS and stuff like that, i mean if you were pulling in a oz of blow and a skiboot full of pills a week straight out of broward county there&#039;d be more to worry about...&nbsp; &nbsp;people say you can never be too paranoid, but there is a point of diminishing returns...

				yes seems very unlikely for some cannabis seeds<br />if you have prior convictions for cultivation or distribution they may be watching you. if they arrest you arrest you for growing, i&#039;m sure they will use your signature for the seeds against you in court.<br />if you are unknown to them i cant see them wasting time doing a CD for some seeds and then not arresting you. it makes no sense.&nbsp; <br />i didnt even know seeds were illegal&nbsp; :o
