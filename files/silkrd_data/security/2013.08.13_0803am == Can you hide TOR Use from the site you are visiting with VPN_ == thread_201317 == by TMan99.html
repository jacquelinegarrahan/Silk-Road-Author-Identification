				I was thinking of something today and it would recquire me to purchase a VPN so that the page I am visiting would think I am visiting from that VPN IP not TOR. <br /><br />But, I would be running through TOR ---&gt; VPN, as if I were to just run through TOR or if TOR were to show up as the last IP address the plan would not work. I need to be using TOR but not have the page know.<br /><br />This is not related to SR it is just something else regarding security. <br /><br />Thanks, hope someone has advice on this.

				That&#039;s a good question; I guess it depends on the VPN client you&#039;re using. If it has an option to input a proxy, then you can try entering the IP/port of the tor instance running on your PC (usually 127.0.0.1:9150). SSL VPNs should work fine over tor, while other protocols i.e. PPTP may not.<br /><br />Most users run tor through the VPN to hide its use from their ISPs and interfere with possible timing correlation attacks. I see why you want to do it the other way around though, and will assume that the site you want to hide your tor use from is sensitive enough to require additional layers of protection beyond a VPN connected straight to you.<br /><br />EDIT: Depending on the site you want to visit, it may be possible to simply use a web proxy over tor. Something like hidemyass.com or kproxy.com may be sufficient if the target site doesn&#039;t run any kind of sophisticated scripting.

				In most cases yes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />You just have to make sure the VPN is either anonymous or supports Bitcoin as payment. <br />VPN makes it so your ISP cannot see that you are using TOR,. They will never be able to see TOR data, but they can tell if the data is coming from TOR.<br /><br />Here is a list of (legal) BTC VPN services - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade#VPN_Services
