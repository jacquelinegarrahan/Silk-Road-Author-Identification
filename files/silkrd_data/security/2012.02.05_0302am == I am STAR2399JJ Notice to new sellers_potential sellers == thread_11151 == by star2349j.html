				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />Just a word to the wise to anyone considering selling on Silk Road.&nbsp; DO NOT DO IT.&nbsp; This place is a huge headache and a full blown fucking scam.&nbsp; I came in excited today with killer deals on products that sell on the web.&nbsp; I know because the pills I was pushing I have moved on other sites for years.&nbsp; Midway through my&nbsp; day, ironically after I get a few hundred bucks in my account I find out I cannot access my funds, my account is frozen up from &quot;too many attempts.&quot;&nbsp; From this point, beings SR said they were waiving the the commissions anyway this weekend I give out a direct btc addy for people to use and contact my buyers advising them of the situation.&nbsp; SR then revokes my seller account and if that aint enough they pocket the money.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR is a bunch of ignorant buttfucks.&nbsp; As for the kid schrady who paid the 300 to me like a cool guy, I am sorry but I aint gonna refund it cuz there aint a dime in my my account.&nbsp; SR in the end it is coming back to you you stupid fucks.<br /><br />

				A. Your account was TEMPORARILY suspended because you were requesting OOE something that is explicitly against the conduct here. <br />B. We never took your coins. They were withdrawn to an off-site address within minutes of you receiving your account suspension notice. <br />C. I don&#039;t see how you forgetting your PIN and subsequently getting locked can be misconstrued as malice on our part. It&#039;s something we do to keep phishers from withdrawing your funds.<br /><br />So your funds were withdrawn offsite, using your PIN. Either a phisher really got you, or something smells funny here.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I&#039;ve been her for, well, a little while now.&nbsp; I&#039;ll throw my chips on the side of the table that says the &quot;the community is probably better off without a seller like you&quot; card comes up next...
