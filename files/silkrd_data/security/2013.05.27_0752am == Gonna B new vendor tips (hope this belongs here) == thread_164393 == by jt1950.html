				basically I need to know before I make the 500$ deposit what to expect with some things.<br /><br />first, I have three bit accounts to transfer funds to.&nbsp; There all through strongcoin.com.&nbsp; Should I spread each of the three account out through diff. sites?&nbsp; Life one with strongcoin, another with mtgox, another with blockchain?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m needing to know the best way to pull funds from bit wallets into US cash.&nbsp; Is there a exchange agency that may specialize in selling my coins at a certain rate and hold on to them until it gets to that rate?&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked around and haven&#039;t found exactly what I&#039;m looking for with that.&nbsp; That and I&#039;m nervous using different wallets and exchanges agencies ect., just b/c of scam potential.<br /><br />So for someone about to become a legit vendor anyone got good tips they wish they would have had before they became a vendor?<br /><br />Also, how exactly do you go about making BTC untraceable?&nbsp; Do you just move them through so many wallets, it&#039;d be hard as hell to track there origin or what?<br /><br />thanks everyone, I&#039;ve done lots of homework on this, but wanna hear from the actual horses mouth on some of these things.<br /><br />king regards

				What are your asking for is kinda of hard to sum up in a post. I&#039;m in the same position as you. All I can tell you is do alot of research and creative thinking. Once you think you have everything figured out then go back&nbsp; and start from scratch because you probably left something out.<br /><br />In terms of cashing out Bitcoins every vendor has their own methods and there&#039;s no right or wrong way to do. There is however a stupid way which is to cash out by using your bank to accept the deposits. That&#039;s just asking for trouble. I&#039;m not trying to be a smart ass but some vendors spend months planning and setting things up. It&#039;s not something you can just jump into without thinking of all the implications. Maybe someone more knowledgable than me can share more than I can but from what I&#039;ve seen Vendors that have safe and quick ways to cash out bitcoins and launder them aren&#039;t just willing and ready to hand out their trade secrets for obvious reasons. <br /><br />It might help if you narrow down your question to one specific element? Sorry if I couldn&#039;t be of more help.

If you had used it in a post that was not deleted, it would have shown up. I have searched for rare, previously used words from late 2011 from my previous forum handle to confirm this.<br /><br />The search function does its job very well - it indexes the entire forum, and can be used to search particular sections by performing the search within them. I&#039;ve used it countless times on both my moderator account and previous handle, always successfully. Yes, the &quot;your last search was 5 seconds ago&quot; error occurs, but you simply have to click the &#039;back&#039; button and try again.<br /><br />Libertas

				I find the search function is more than adequate. It&#039;s no Google search like on their homepage but then again I&#039;ll take the basic search and not get ads stuffed down my throat and tracked and selectively advertised certain products based on my browsing history..sry little off topic just had to throw that out there.
