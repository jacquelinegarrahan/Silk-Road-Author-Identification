				About 12 hours ago I transferred BTC to SR from my wallet.&nbsp; I re-used a previous SR deposit address for my account, and 12 hours later still nothing in SR.&nbsp; I looked up the SR deposit address on blockexplorer.com and see where they&#039;ve been &quot;Received: Address&quot;.&nbsp; Does this mean that SR has at least found my bitcoins?<br /><br />When I click on the transaction link, these coins say &quot;Not yet redeemed&quot; under the &quot;Output&quot; section, &quot;Redeemed at input&quot; column.&nbsp; Again, does this mean SR is simply waiting for more data (blocks, etc.) before it posts to my account?&nbsp; Or by re-using an old deposit address did I screw something up and can kiss these coins goodbye?<br /><br />I can share the blockexplorer.com URL to the transaction in question, but not clear on how much of a privacy breach this would be for me.&nbsp; Thanks community for help/advice.

				You need to contact admin from SilkRoad itself and they will amend this for you, it happens quite a lot according to other posts previously posted here.<br />You&#039;ll find the contact us link at the very bottom right hand of the page!

It&#039;s been almost a day and no reply from the SR admins.&nbsp; Guess my next question is how long it typically takes them to reply before I get annoying and bump the topic with &#039;em?&nbsp; It&#039;s been well over 24 hours&nbsp; now and my BTC still haven&#039;t arrived, but a few other BTC I transferred (using the newly generated deposit address this time) have arrived no problem.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s safe to say there&#039;s definitely a problem with the first transfer now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just hoping that when the SR admins look through the bitcoin ledger (assuming they will) and see the deposit address in question, they&#039;ll be able to track down the missing BTC and deposit them into my account.&nbsp; At this point it&#039;s safe for me to say at least that you SHOULD NOT reuse old deposit addresses to deposit bitcoins into your SR account.&nbsp; Forget about the security concern, the SR software just plain doesn&#039;t like it :(<br /><br />Anyhow, update forthcoming if I hear something from our lauded admins. Thanks.

				I used a duplicate address the last time I deposited. Just happened to be looking through my wallet and noticed.<br />Everything went OK. I still will remember to click the new address link though.<br /><br />The only trouble I had was getting from Mt Gox into my pc wallet. I forgot to run Tor after initiating the transfer in the clear net.<br />Next morning, nothing. Reboot, run Tor, open wallet, go out for a few hours and all was good.<br /><br />I then sent to SR with a used address and it came in about an hour or so so I don&#039;t think a used address is a guaranteed screw up.<br />Their may be another problem.<br /><br />Let us know how it turns out.

				So&nbsp; good news.&nbsp; Only one day after sending SR a PM on the main site, they credited my account and responded with the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry about that. I&#039;m not sure why they didn&#039;t make it through. Use the address on your account page next time and let us know if you have any more trouble.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anyhow, there&#039;s really no good reason I can come up with for using a recycled address in the first place (it was human error on my part), but apparently is did cause a real issue that required intervening on the part of SR admins.&nbsp; From other posts it sounds like I&#039;m not the only one that&#039;s had this problem either. So lesson learned I guess is just to cycle new addresses and forget about the old ones.&nbsp; But if it does happen to you, send SR the address you used, BTC amount, wait a day, and those clever bitches can apparently fix anything...
