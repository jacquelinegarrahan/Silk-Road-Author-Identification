				Thanks Shroomeister,<br /><br />That makes a lot more sense, and I understand how to do that.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m aware that vendors have their keys on their profile, but do I just give vendors my key in an encrypted message when I need to PM them?<br /><br />And yeah LouisCyphre that bit was explained in the video, so thanks!<br /><br />

				YES. Give your PUBLIC key away and guard your private key with your life.<br /><br />Normally (from a vendor perspective) if you encrypt a message to me and when I decrypt it to read it, if you included your public key in the msg, then I would reply with an encrypted message back.<br /><br />Thats the usual way to do it.<br /><br />Glad to make some sense of it for you. Good luck!
