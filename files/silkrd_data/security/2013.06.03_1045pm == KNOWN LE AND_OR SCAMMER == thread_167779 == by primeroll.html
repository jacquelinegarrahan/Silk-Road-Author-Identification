				If an address can be PROVEN to be linked to LE why cant all vendors be made aware of it? Maybe not post it on he forums, but put it in the vendor round table thread or something.

Good thing DPR is in charge and not me, if it was me id be exposing LE anychance i got and sending crack to governors and police chiefs houses and fucking with them in all kinds of ways. <br /><br />Thats why more mature-minded individuals are running this place and not me :P

				thats retarded. why would a cop care about ruining your rep? he wouldn&#039;t: he&#039;d just arrest you. but since its better safe then sorry I guess I wont send to either of you. not that I send anything (should be talked about in the round table, eh?) and not that he can&#039;t just change his name now that you outed him.<br />you ripped him off&nbsp; , he got mad, your thinking you can get away with it by screaming rape. pathetic. how I know you know I&#039;m right? cause you just got mad bro.&nbsp; then again you can get a new account too. we all can be whoever we want to be :)))))
