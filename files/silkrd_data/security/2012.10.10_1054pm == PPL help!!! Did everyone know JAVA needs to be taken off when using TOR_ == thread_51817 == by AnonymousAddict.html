				I was just told that JAVA needs to be removed or disabled when using TOR? I had no clue about this any many others maynot also, because ppls who say just use privnote to send the info for their parcel has to use java, when i was put on to tor and silkroad no one said nothing aout this, who knows what im talking about and please tell me what to do to turn it off? I was just giving this info by someone very computer intelligent and knows his/her stuff and says Java can reveal your true location, I have my pgp and all set up and even when i connect to the net i piggyback off someone eles wifi and then i use cyberghost to mask my ip or another VPN tool

				Two things.<br /><br />1. Java is not Javascript. They are both languages used for various applications/services on the web, which makes things confusing.<br />2. Your friend is correct.<br /><br />You can disable Javascript in the Tor Browser Bundle which I imagine you&#039;re using, by going to the TorBrowser button -&gt; Options -&gt; Untick &quot;Enable Javascript&quot;.<br /><br />Note: some websites will become non-functional as a result of this. But not SR or SRF, which is what you want.<br /><br />Java, which is inside many web browsers, is disabled, as is Flash, with the TBB anyway, so you don&#039;t need to worry about that so much. And never use Privnote! Horrible idea that.

				What can happen if you keep JavaScript turned on? How is it a threat to being anonymous?<br /><br />On a side note, if you want to use uTorrent via TOR, and you use the same connection for that as you use for SR, then will it be possible to trace you? I&#039;m assuming it should be okay to do it if you don&#039;t use the two simultaneously, and you get a new identity in between using one or the other.

				And as for JAVA, if you don&#039;t need it on your machine and most people do not, get rid of it! <br /><br />It s a major security problem a major target of exploits after having vulnerability after vulnerability discovered by researchers and hackers alike.
