				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve just noticed that when you load a page such as this:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13973.msg135199;boardseen#new<br /><br />for a brief instant we are connected to <br /><br />status.icq.com<br />opi.yahoo.com<br /><br />Reload the page and check the status bar of your browser to see it flash by.<br /><br />Naturally, we are behind TOR whatever happens, but this is a bit unsettling. I didn&#039;t ask to be connected to Yahoo or MSN servers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think people should be allowed to have things like AOL/Yahoo instant messenger etc etc. It seems too insecure on a lot of levels. Even if they are, it shouldn&#039;t mean every forum user makes a connection to their servers just because one person in a thread is using the service.<br /><br />We come here for the forums/private chat, if we want to exchange emails outside of that then there is always TORmail or something similar. Using any kind of yahoo and MSN instant messenger functionality seems insane, even if it is Torified and you setup your yahoo/msn account through TOR explicitly for this purpose (which I doubt).<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think if people fill out the IM fields in their profile, it will hit those servers to check for online/offline status. So yeah, those profile fields should be disabled probably. I doubt there is any security risk though, just slows things down a bit.

				Yeah it happpens on some pages I just realized. I tried loading a random SR page and didn&#039;t see it, but then using the one Pine suggested it happpened. It also opened a Tor circuit to those pages. It is happening because the icons displayed are hotlinked from those servers. This opens substantial anonymity and security holes and should be immediately taken care of. For one you are exiting the Tor network when you load those pages, and getting all the risk that comes with that. For two even if you assume that the SR hidden service can not be traced and monitored, I bet AIM and ICQ will hand over their server logs, so if feds own your entry guard they could correlate your entry traffic with AIM / ICQ server logs of Tor exits that loaded those images, to deanonymize people without actually watching traffic arrive at the SR server. <br /><br />Also you might end up opening those hotlinked images via a circuit you are using for other things, and end up linking your actions together (for example maybe you were talking in an IRC when you loaded that forum page, and the hotlinked icons were loaded through the same circuit that you were using for IRC. Now your presence on that IRC server is linked to your activity on SR.)

				Yes technically those links exit the tor network through an exit node but there is no risk to you, no more than visiting any other clearnet site via tor. Even if they contain an HTTP referrer header would it matter? Might bug the exit node operator, I dunno...<br /><br />But yes it should be taken care of and everyone should double-check their profile to ensure those fields are not filled out.
