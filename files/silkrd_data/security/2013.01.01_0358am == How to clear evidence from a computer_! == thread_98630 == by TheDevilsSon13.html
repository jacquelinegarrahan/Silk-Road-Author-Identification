				Just make sure your computer is off when the fuzz comes. Commercial software is now available to steal TrueCrypt keys from RAM, and while it may not work as well as advertised, the best defense is a turned off computer.<br /><br />BTW, people on this forum roundly dismissed the ElcomSoft program, but Bruce Schneier and his commenters were more concerned.<br /><br />https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/breaking_hard-d.html

				Believe it or not, data recovery firms are way more successful at recovering physically damaged HDDs than overwritten data. In fact, just a single overwrite is more than sufficient, and the more random the data of the overwrite, the better. Reboot the PC and use Boot and Nuke or a similar app; any overwrite method is fine. If your SATA HDD supports the Secure Erase command (95% do), that will overwrite the entire drive--including damaged areas--very quickly and thoroughly. Hybrid drives and SSDs absolutely require the use of the Secure Erase command due to the way they store data.<br /><br />If you&#039;re really paranoid about the NSA using secret technology on your drive, it won&#039;t hurt to take the platters out and manually destroy them after you overwrite everything. Just don&#039;t let anyone find the remains or you can be charged with evidence tampering, obstruction of justice, etc.

				DBAN takes way too long, like 5 - 10 hours on your average 300 - 500 GB hard drive, to be an effective defense during a raid. Your best option at that point is degaussing with a strong magnet. If you have incriminating evidence on your hard drive now, you should DBAN it now and set up full disk encryption. Don&#039;t wait until you are getting raided.<br /><br />Sure, there are attacks on encrypted drives too, as we&#039;re discussing in AnonymousAddict&#039;s thread, but it makes LE&#039;s job a few orders of magnitude harder than the solution you&#039;re currently using, and unless you&#039;re a terrorist or cartel king pin, they&#039;re probably not waiting outside your door, prepared for a cold boot attack.

				I don&#039;t have a specific number for you, but it depends on the hard drive...<br /><br />Drive designers continually increase the linear density of magnetic recording to create higher data storage capacity per disk. This raises the disk magnetic coercivity, the field required to write bits on the magnetic media. As the magnetic coercivity increases, the fields required to erase the data on recorded disks increases. Thus an older degausser may not fully erase data on a newer hard disk drive. New perpendicular recording drives may not be erasable by present degaussers designed for past longitudinal recording drives.<br /><br />Future generations of magnetic recording media may use very high magnetic coercivity disks to achieve areal densities greater than 500 gigabits per square inch. These drives may have technology using laser light in the magnetic write element of the disk drive, to raise the temperature of a spot on the magnetic medium in order to lower the magnetic coercivity to the point where the write element can record a bit on the very high coercivity magnetic media. For disk drives using this Heat or Thermally Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR/TAMR) technology the degausser field required to erase the disk drive at room temperatures may be impossible or impractical to achieve. In this case the drive may have to be physically destroyed.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99520.msg699299#msg699299

				You guys are on the right track. I&#039;m a big fan of full disk encryption. On top of securing your data, it offers the safest form of software-based data erasure. If you overwrite the first gigabyte of the device, you destroy the encryption key and any hope of recovering the contents. Zeroing out the first gigabyte takes only seconds, too, so it&#039;s simultaneously safer and faster than DBAN.

				astor is right, as the data density on rewritable media increases and becomes more high tech, so does the difficulty in quickly and thoroughly erasing the information on them.<br /><br />Ive done a little research on HERF guns, which are directional energy weapons which one could theoretically have pointed at ones HDD in order to flatten or scramble it at the flick of a switch.. check them out.

				I would run tails from a boot cd in a laptop with no hard drive and have everything stored on a usb stick encrypted with truecrypt using a hidden volume. that way if you get raided you may have time to eject the usb drive and smash it to a million pieces. if you dont have time to smash it up at least its encrypted. Of course keep backups of your usb drive in multiple safe locations!<br /><br />As for wiping the hard drive... use DBAN although to be honest i&#039;d just move your data to an encrypted usb stick and smash your hard drive up...

From the same analysis I quoted earlier:<br /><br />To positively prevent data from recovery, disks can be removed from disk drives and broken up, or even ground to microscopic pieces. (Actually, simple disk bending is highly effective, particularly in emergency situations.) Obsolete government document DoD 5220 required physical destruction of the storage medium (the magnetic disks) for data classified higher than Secret. Even such physical destruction is not absolute if any remaining disk pieces are larger than a single 512-byte record block in size, about 1/125&quot; in today&#039;s drives. As linear and track densities increases, the maximum allowable size of disk fragments become ever smaller. <br />

				Now if you computer geeks could just get my shit to my mailbox in under a month during the Christmas days. <br /><br />You&#039;re so focused on security. Let me guess, you do weed, and or psychedelics. I&#039;ve been there. <br /><br />Just because you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not out to get you !!!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;d give up my mailing address right here, for that 2 gram German speed I ordered a month ago to show up. I really don&#039;t think LE cares about my shitty little addiction, and if they do they can have me. I&#039;ve dodged more damning evidence than possession.<br /><br />Shit I&#039;d be happy to have the pig cops deliver me my package so I can plead &quot;plausible deniability&quot;. <br /><br />I ain&#039;t afraid of LE for small personal usage&nbsp; amounts. Come get me bitches!<br /><br />Chill out and order drugs. You&#039;re already liable for being on this forum if they ever were to go to court, which they wont. Too many 100.000 cases. name me one LE agcy in the world with those resources.. <br /><br />Yeah,&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t think so. Chill the fuck out and get high. You know you want to. Stop being a fucking pussy !!! ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;

				think there would be any interest in thermite laced hard drives? would destroy all data in less than a second :D<br />i would probably have the data encrypted and then physically destroy, it could never be decrypted with missing bytes.

				On their own, both sound legal to me. Now if the HD contained illegal material or if the gun was stolen... they both sound like bad ideas.<br /><br />I personally just like to do the very best I can to destroy the data and then ditch the drive was my point. Take away the alligators and bullets as required. I genuinely believe no matter how well you erase the drive, or destroy it physically, that you then need to get rid of it. Getting rid of the evidence after taking all other measures is just another layer of security in case others fail... you could make a user error with one of the programs, but if you bury it in the dessert then it won&#039;t matter. If you pop it back in your computer then any mistake in your other steps will ruin you. I just don&#039;t trust everything I read on the internet on proper data destruction techniques, but I trust that tossing my hard drive into the Hudson river after taking all other precautions will keep me out of handcuffs. <br /><br />Oh, even better, dump those disks in battery acid! <br /><br />Another good reason for ditching the drives, tampering with evidence is a crime in itself. How do I know even if LE can&#039;t access the data anymore, that they can&#039;t still prove it was in fact destroyed intentionally... idk, I could just never be comfortable enough to reuse drives again once I decided it was necessary to destroy the contents for the sake of my safety.

				The question is : &quot;&quot;wil a magnet wipe all data from a hdd&quot;&quot;.<br /><br />Answer is,&nbsp; yes it will, or at least, it can wipe all data of the hdd.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing<br /><br />But if you are just doing drugs or murder, smashing the hdd with a hammer or drilling some holes, should do the same, or have the same result.<br />No way to read the data from the hdd after that.<br /><br />The strongest point is not on the magnet but a few inches above the magnet.<br /><br />A episode of mythbusters showed that a bankpas had to be held above the hdd and not to close or on the magnet itself.

				If I was to wipe my hard drive with Darik&#039;s Boot And Nuke would I need my windows vista disk to install it after it&#039;s done wiping everything?

				Of course. You will need the disk to re-install your P.C&#039;s&nbsp; operating system.
