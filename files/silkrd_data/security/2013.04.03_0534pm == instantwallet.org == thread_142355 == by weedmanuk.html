				Hi all, can anyone make me feel better. I have several instant wallets with 30 ish btc&#039;s in total, after reading the message stating they will sort it out if you supply the url&#039;s what do others think ? Am I going to get them back ?<br />Has this happened before and turned out ok ?<br /><br />Also can anyone advise on a good way of getting your btc from SR to an exchange without attracting attention. I was told not to go straight from SR to BTC exchange is that correct ?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Modify message<br />

				Same here, waiting for Instawallet to hand back my bitcoins. Would you believe it was enroute to SR... :(&nbsp; (no birthday party with Blue Giraffe for me...)<br /><br />For what it is worth, I think that Instawallet will give the coins back. But how long will this take?&nbsp; You can check your bitcoin block (wallet) at the site https://blockchain.info&nbsp; This will make clear if your coins are still with Instawallet.<br /><br />You can also use a service like http://www.bitcoinfog.com/ to hide your coin-transaction. But then you are trusting another service with your coins.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I think I will in future simply send the BTC to my personal wallet.... live and learn.

				I&#039;ve used &#039;BitcoinsUK&#039; several times and he&#039;s always quick and has great rates. He works directly with a few reputable UK vendors so you know he&#039;s legit.

				Ok typed in my wallet address into blockchain info<br />and see allot transactions and on the top it says<br />available BTC 0 ?? Does this mean im fucked??<br />or is this all due to the fact that instawallet is undergoing<br />some diffeculties or does it mean that I cannot send any from<br />blockchain?<br /><br />Cheers

				I figured I better step into this thread and let everyone know the bitter truth. Instawallet.org and bitcoin-central.net (same ownership) were robbed and bitcoins were lost, how much is unknown yet. They currently have a claims process for all accounts found here: <br /><br />***CLEARNET WARNING*** <br />http://notice.instawallet.org/<br />***CLEARNET WARNING*** <br /><br />They even admit on that notice that their infrastructure was flawed to begin with, that&#039;s why they cannot reopen the site as is. The reason was that this site posts your BTC wallet, and password in cleartext in your URL bar. Now the SSL encryption &quot;theoretically&quot; ensures protection from a MiTM attack. Although if you&#039;ve ever emailed, IM&#039;d, txt&#039;d, or opened it in a google/apple product the wallet and password have been indexed and are now in the cloud. <br /><br />With that being said I hope for the best on everyone that has to go through the claims process, so far BTC return processes have been essentially nonexistent. Hopefully everyone will learn from this event that the only safe place for your BTC is in your possession.

				About 1 month ago instawallet did server maintenance that caused all wallets that didn&#039;t have any BTC in them at the time to have their wallet addresses changed. I didn&#039;t know that so I sent about $600 of BTC to my wallet and when I went to my URL a few days later I was shocked to see the BTC weren&#039;t there. By that time instawallet already knew what had happened and was accepting e-mails for missing BTC. I e-mailed them and within 48 hours I had my BTC restored. I have faith that they are an honest business and once they start accepting claims people will get their coins back. <br /><br />In 7 months of vending on SR I have learned that whenever there is a disaster you just need to sit tight and be patient. So far I have lost $0 from services like SR and instawallet having issues.

				So with instawallet dead what is everybody using? I found blockchain.info/wallet<br /><br />It seems to be just as disposable as instawallet but in addition to having a random address for the wallet, there is a pass phrase added. Seems just a bit more secure than instawallet.<br /><br />Instawallet seemed sketchy to me. No worries that it is gone. I lost less than 1/10 of 1 BTC so not worried here.

Ask yourself this question &quot;Would you mail cash to a complete stranger to hold onto until you need to spend it?&quot; IF you answered yes, you may want to seriously rethink your financial strategies.
