				Well to truly remove any trace of TOR or previously saved links and other various saved goodies. You would require a new harddisk or (soild). <br />You could do a 32 pass wipe but still... I guess this only applies to would be vendors or the security minded. The best method for accessing the &quot;hidden&quot; network would be a notebook/netbook devoted for the purpose. Plenty of other stuff that would be viable too.

				&gt; You could do a 32 pass wipe but still... <br /><br />Wiping the disk still isn&#039;t technically safe no matter how many times because bad blocks get relocated automatically by disks, if sensitive data is on a block that is no longer in service it wont get overwritten if you do wipe it.<br /><br />This is moot in reality, the type of effort required to do this sort of recovery is not something that law enforcement would be interested in even if they did have your hard drive.&nbsp; It would have to be a huge case (tens to hundreds of millions of dollars) before they would put that level of effort in to finding evidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to be secure you should either be absolutely secure with extreme measures (like replacing the disk) and take it to that extreme in every area, or just be realistic about the risks.&nbsp; Most everybody is secure in some ways and insecure in others (that they may or may not recognize), then they think they are secure overall.&nbsp; Behaving like that is lying to yourself.&nbsp; Overestimating your safety is dangerous.<br /><br />It&#039;s much safer to acknowledge the weaknesses and assess the risk of each area realistically.&nbsp; The first step to fixing the problem is to see it.<br /><br />
