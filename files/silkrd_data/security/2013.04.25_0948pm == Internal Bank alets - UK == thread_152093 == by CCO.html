				Does anyone have any info on internal bank alerts in relation to deposits.<br /><br />So for example I read this story about a cop who was stealing drugs from the impounded warehouse and selling them back on the street, he was busted as he was making regular deposits into his bank account and this trigger an internal alert that was then investigated.<br /><br />What I am looking for are the parameters of these alerts, I imagine if I deposited 10k this would trigger an alert but what is the min sum that can be deposited on a regular basis without trigger some form of investigation.<br /><br />

				any suspicious transactions are supposed to be reported, large deposits followed by large cash withdrawals or online spending, regular large deposits from unexplained source&#039;s eg. not salary. etc etc. Anything out of the ordinary for your account eg. you usually get paid £1200 a month all of a sudden you have £3000 appear in your account, then £2000, £4500 etc. <br /><br />Also once something has been referred the anti money laundering team will then search your account history for any other information that hasn&#039;t been picked up previously. And conduct an investigation &amp; if needed will contact the police<br /><br />Rules are also different for business and personal accounts with business accounts not being under as much scrutiny<br /><br />Just ask yourself if you would think it was suspicious if you were working for the bank. <br /><br />Hope this helps

Most people dribble a few hundred at a time to try and stay under the radar. But again, if a bank worker see&#039;s this as suspicious they are supposed to report it. I&#039;m not certain on internet banking triggers but I know they do exist. Most banks have a daily online transfer limit of between £7500-£10000.

				Don&#039;t put any income into your bank accounts until you can account for it. That might sound like useless advice but it is not. Most successful drug vendors on SR or drug dealers offline will get caught this way. You can live your life with prepaid cards and cash until you come up with a good strategy for your income. Until then assume your bank account is part of the blockchain. That can be frustrating, but there&#039;s plenty of good income multiplying possibilities for spare cash. As far as I&#039;m concerned the DEA and IRS are evil conjoined twins. Just because you didn&#039;t personally hear that they are in &#039;cahoots&#039; doesn&#039;t mean a thing unless you think LE agents keep no secrets. Same goes for any country, not just USA.
