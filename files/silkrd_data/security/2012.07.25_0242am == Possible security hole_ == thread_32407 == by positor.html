				A question for the peeps.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you order one of those passwords from the Erotica section. You log into that site with a unique login/password. Most of those sites show video which is really slow on Tor, so someone might mess up and go clearnet. If the web site was in on it, they could link your user name by virtue of the unique login/password they gave you and thereby get your IP.<br /><br />Maybe I am too paranoid?<br /><br />positor

You`re supposed to watch them on the clearnet, tor isn`t optimized for high bandwidth. This is of course if your watching legal porn and not CP.....

I think that study is going to need more research and backup. If that were true we would have a mass of SR users/onion site visitors. I think that the study is corrupt by too many false factors/human errors.

I live here and people can buy all that crap legally through clearnet/shops anywhere for cheap! We even have places, for watching DVDS and wanking of! Our whole sex culture is open, and I fail to see how this is possible. Even bestiality is legal here! (No, I`m not into it). I don`t even see a symbiotic business relation between tor and the adult industry based on my experience.&nbsp;
