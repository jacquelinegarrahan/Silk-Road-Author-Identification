				im not just talking about laundering or cashing out, but using your earnings from SR to buy legitimate investments. i would like to eventually use my money to invest into something real. investments, business, ect<br />as a low level vendor, this is something iv done a decent amount of thinking about<br />i thought that perhaps buying a website would be something of a good idea. you can buy fully set up and automated websites from somewhere like flippa.com which will generate steady income. i think buying a website would also attract less heat from the tax office and similar authorities <br /><br />looking to get a discussion/brainstorm going. whats everyones thoughts on this issue?

				I&#039;ve been slinging drugs for 12 years. On the street and am new to the SR thing. Not new to mailing packages. My experience and alternative job allowed me to make a lot. I have taken family members covered in debt and help pay everything off. and paid it off. A person should always have a backup account where they stash 25% of everything they make. So when you get poped and do your bid. You&#039;ll have equity to come home to. Never store it in any bank account. I personally say no to all countries and banks. Or at your home or your closest family home. Cuz when u get home your SOL. Store it in mason jars and burry them. No one will ever find them, especially if you target an area off limits to the public. But anytime you spend more than 10,000usd an automatic red flag goes off in the irs and homeland databases notifying someone of your purchase. Usually starts a small irs audit. If it doesnt check out, they do a full audit. finally you go to jail.<br />Basically the idea of retiring or doing something else with the money is great, everyone should have an exit strategy. Best way to cycle money from the IRS is to already have opened a small business liscense. using quickbooks pro enter your income from drugs just as if it came from selling bread rolls. And pay the taxes on it. bing its in the bank safe and you can use it for big purchases. Have a store front or restaurant.

				Well first off i agree with sellmebulk. again, lol and I think you guys should think of investing in bouillon, specifically gold. But thats just me, plus you&#039;d need about a 10k-20k initial investment to make any real money off commodities...<br /><br />MMM

Have had my house raided by the DEA due to an &quot;annonymous tipster&quot; who offered to buy mdma from me to the cops, so pretty much a controlled delivery. What the DEA and local police didnt count on was me not keeping ANYTHING related to my drug selling business in my house. They found a half ounce of weed and a bong and i ended up spending 10 days in jail for it because everyone knew i was lucky. Dont keep anything out of where you sell at.

Home. Keep them separate. Make sure to wash all money before you invest, and I&#039;d suggest doing something like buying real estate, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, keep safe. Store money in a secret location, like said, so if the busters come busting you&#039;ve got a plan when you&#039;re out.<br /><br />Happy Crimes!<br /><br />- The Consultant</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				A chain of fried chicken stores seems like a good plan.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to donate heavily to the DEA charities and glad-hand with the local politicians.<br /><br />Hide in plain sight.<br />
