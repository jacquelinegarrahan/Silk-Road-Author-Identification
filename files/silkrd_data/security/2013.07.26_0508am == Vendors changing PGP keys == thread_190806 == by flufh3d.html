				A few of my go-to vendors have recently gone on small vacations and come back with new pgp keys.<br /><br />Ive heard that this is a red flag and am curious how nervous i should be about ordering from them. Any input would be appreciated

If everything is normal and you feel comfortable, then order.<br /><br />This will keep you safe from two things; being scammed and coming into contact with possible LE.<br /><br />What do you lose from not ordering? Nothing, there are plenty of other vendors.<br /><br />Security is your most important resource here.

				There are many valid reasons for changing. It&#039;s actually much better for security to have keys expire. Equipment can be destroyed periodically as well, requiring replacement with fresh software.

				new key should be signed with old key to prove new key was created by person with access to old key password.<br /><br />ask vendor to sign his new key. should be standard practice.

One key is set to never expire and is only used for the purpose of verifying the transition of keys. The 2nd is one which should have an expiry date although not neccersary. This ensures if one of the keys are missing, then the vendor can still be positively identified. Of course, a vendor should always keep several encrypted backups of their PGP keys and for example, bury some, keep some in a hard to reach public place (tied to a tree branch 20ft up maybe?), in a double MBB under the substrate of a fish tank, in the internal walls of the house behind plug sockets for example (keep a safe distance between them to prevent possible EMFs) etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I love you StExo. Just when you think you&#039;ve read all there is to know about PGP, something new pops up. Thanks&nbsp; ;)
