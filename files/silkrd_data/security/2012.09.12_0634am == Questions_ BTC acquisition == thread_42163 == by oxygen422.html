				Hey guys,<br />Total noob here to SR. Total noob to anything that isn&#039;t windows and firefox as well lol.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&#039;m trying to learn my way around here and how to stay anonymous.&nbsp; So, let me tell you where I am; I have a USB stick with liberte that I am using to access SR.&nbsp; My main concern is acquiring Bitcoins.&nbsp; My understanding is vague on the &#039;proper&#039; way to do this and remain anonymous.<br /><br />Firstly, my concern is accessing any and all parties involved in the BTC acquisition process.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that some of these parties cannot be accessed with Tor.&nbsp; If&nbsp; not, then, how do you acess them anonymously?&nbsp; Which will Tor redflag and which won&#039;t it?<br /><br />Secondly is the cash transfer at a bank branch to an account for BTC.&nbsp; What is this process like; do they ever ask for identification?<br /><br />I would like to humbly request from an experienced user how they step by step acuire BTC and remain anonymous.&nbsp; In each step, I am especially interested in specifying what and how they are accessing in regard to weather you are: 1.) at home using your wifi or using &#039;public&#039; 2.) using Tor or Liberte or are unprotected 3.) using your computer or a &#039;public&#039; one. 4.) using Tor mail or a disposable one, from say Gmail.<br /><br />etc... I really don&#039;t want to leave a loose end anywhere and accidentally do something dumb like get flagged because I used Tor on a site or walk into the bank and be suspicious, or access a site unprotected.&nbsp; I assume I should never be doing anything at home pertaining to SR without being protected with liberte (does booting liberte from USB on my home computer compromise it in any way?).... etc... At any rate, I&#039;m sure there are some pertinent details which I forgot to ask about the process.&nbsp; Thank in advance for any help, I apologize if I am being overly-thorough ;)

				Mt.Gox is the only site I am aware that will block you on Tor, but you don&#039;t need them anyway.<br /><br />Start here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36048.0<br />
