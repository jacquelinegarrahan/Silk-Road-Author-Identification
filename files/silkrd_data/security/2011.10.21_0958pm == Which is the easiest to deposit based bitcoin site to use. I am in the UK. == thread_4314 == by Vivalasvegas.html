				I signed up for Intersango (formerly Britcoin) but found out today that their easy option to deposit money in a HSBC account is no longer available because the bank closed their account on the day I deposited money :( Any help for a newbie will be very much appreciated :)

				Shit, I didnt realise they had lost their account. That is a pain as it was ideal. Hopefully they will be able to sort their shit out and get another one set up soon. Sorry, but I cant help you mate, as Intersango was the only one I have used.

				I don&#039;t like posting &quot;me too&quot; posts, but me too!<br />Desperate to find somewhere else.<br /><br />Still a bit of a noob re: bitcoin, but I read somewhere about Mt.Gox accepting bank deposits from UK people, I had a look at their site and can&#039;t see it, plus I *think* I read somewhere about Mt.Gox not being terribly honest/scamming people?

				Apparently with TradeHill you can bank transfer GBP to them and it will convert to USD.<br /><br />I&#039;m just gonna wait until Intersango gets their account situation sorted, which i hope is very soon.<br /><br />Edit: Just seen theres a cost of 20 USD for a bank transfer from International accounts for the TradeHill method. No chance lol

				Thanks for all the replies. I just recieved a message from intersango stating they have opened up a new account and are just finalising the details. As for their closed HSBC account, that is still up in the air and they still have my money somewhere in limbo :(<br /><br />Will let you know when it is all up and running and the GBP finally show up in my account ready to by BTC.

				I am in the UK and use MtGox and have never once had to send in ID! I simply bank transfer funds to my Mt Gox account, buy bitcoins, then withdraw them to SR (or a tumbler service like instawallet.org first). Not been asked for ID or anything like that so will use them until I do. I am planning to move to Intersango/Britcoin when they&#039;ve got a bank account back up though as coin prices seem to be a little better.<br /><br />Also worth noting SR state they have a built in coin tumbler so transfers from MtGox / Intersango direct to SR should be safe.

				Ok so here is a Wednesday 2nd Nov 2011 udate regarding Intersango and UK deposits. After speaking online through Skype with Patrick of Intersango he stated that they have opened up a Lloyds account in the UK but deposits made into that account will be slow because of manual deposits (not too sure what that means but it does sound slow:)) <br />As for my money that I deposited on October 21st, it should be posted to my account next week becasu HSBC has finally released a cheque of all final money to them.<br />I went into a HSBC bank yesterday to ask if I can get my money back (yes, I am a misguided person sometimes) and the lady kept stating that she could not tell me about the account because of Data protection laws but hinted that the money is with Intersango and perhaps they have my money and do not want to give it to me.&nbsp; This whole thing feels really weird to me and i will keep you all posted when it is resolved.<br />&nbsp;

				...what he meant was, its not an automated process....didnt say exactly....but has to check each transaction manually...then i guess cross references the code and moves the amount over to reflect in your Account view in britcoins/intersango...<br /><br /><br />ok<br /><br /><br />
