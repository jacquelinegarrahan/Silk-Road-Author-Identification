				So I am pretty new here and I&#039;m planning on making a purchase in a few days and I&#039;m wondering how safe it is to have bitcoins sent directly to my SR address. I am planning on using the bitinstant service and doing the &quot;major bank branch&quot; option. Then where it says bitcoin address i just type the address where it says &quot;to deposit bitcoins....&quot; in my account&nbsp; right? Is it safe to do it this way? Will the bank ID me or have any questions? Any input is greatly appreciated, thanks!&nbsp; :D

				go for it. the feds now have a way to track your SR account with you. All they have to do is verify that the address you gave is linked to an SR account and you&#039;re fucked...<br /><br />or you could get a wallet

				It is not usual for banks for request ID for cash deposits into an account. <br /><br />However, you still don&#039;t want to send directly to SR. Let us say SR is compromised by the FBI (actually our default assumption, we don&#039;t think it is true, but if it were, it wouldn&#039;t matter so long as we adopt appropriate security practices like PGP and what I&#039;m outlining here), then they could generate bitcoin addresses and look for matches on the recipient addresses of all transactions on the exchanges. A bit long winded, but possible.<br /><br />So, you ought to use a cash deposit, you ought to either launder the bitcoin or else use a series of intermediary bitcoin wallets e.g. like instawallets or use a torified bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />I describe all of this process in a step by step fashion in a post in the &#039;How to use the Silk Road completely anonymously&#039; thread that is pinned up in the security forum I think it is)

				I do it every time. i think its safe to do. after you receive the bitcoins to your account all you have to do is go to your account tab and click on &quot;get new address&quot;

				smokeweed420: adding funds to your old addresses still adds to your account... so it doesn&#039;t make a difference to the feds lol

				Would it be all right to say, get an instawallet and have them sent to there then to my SR wallet? 2 instawallets? From what I&#039;ve heard, people have been sending directly to SR with no issues. I read that there is no way to tell that a bitcoin address is for SR.

				It seems that Bitinstant --&gt; Coinapult(With a tormail address) --&gt; Silkroad seems to be a good method. Would you recommend putting the coins through an instawallet or two first before going into my SR, or should this be fine?

				I think the safety of that is very acceptable. Silk Road has it&#039;s own tumbler, and I bet vendors themselves do some BTC laundring as well.<br /><br />If the feds want to bust you using the block chain, they&#039;re gonna have to proof that every BTC address between yours and the vendor&#039;s, actually belongs to you. This is going to be very hard to do, if not impossible. No way they&#039;re going to even try all that just to bust a user.<br /><br />If you&#039;re paranoid, or afraid that powerful people are really out to get you convicted, then you might consider laundering your BTC through bitcoinfog. It will cost you something like 2%, and then they&#039;re extremely hard to trace back to you. I consider it big overkill.

So far, you have not committed any crime.<br /><br />Then, when you send your money to a vendor (the actual incriminating part), this cannot be traced back to you because of the tumbler. So you should be safe.

				On bitinstant it says that there has been delay from people using tormail. When was that updated last? I want my coins ASAP. Will I have any issues sending coins to my tormail?
