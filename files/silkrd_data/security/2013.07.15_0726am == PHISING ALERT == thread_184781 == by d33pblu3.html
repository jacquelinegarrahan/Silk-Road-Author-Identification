				FUCK<br /><br />He got me. What do I do? He&#039;s logged onto my account right now and is asking people to FE. I got a request to join Atlantis and i fucking did. Then got logged out of SR and now I cant get back in. Now when I view the account people are saying FE as requested like 56 seconds ago. Holy crap.<br /><br />The site that I joined I used the same loggin details but not the same pin code. Am I FUCKED?????

I would also contact samesamebutdifferent and ask if he can contact SR on your behalf and send Libertas a PM as he seems to be active here most of the time.&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t know if I&#039;d call this Phishing, it&#039;s not trying to look like Silk Road, and does call itself a different name: &quot;Silk Road Advanced.&quot; The sorting options and price by weight feature they&#039;re offering could actually be useful to some people, could help with working out prices etc. I&#039;m not going to pay for it though, I&#039;d rather do the maths!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184781.msg1341556#msg1341556">Quote from: magicfalcon on July 15, 2013, 12:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...I got a request to join Atlantis and i fucking did.

You should always use a different password for each site you join, whether Atlantis, BMR, Silk Road Advanced or whatever. Luckily for you, if you did use a different PIN like you said, they won&#039;t be able to withdraw or transfer your money yet. They&#039;ve probably applied for a PIN reset though, so I&#039;d get in touch with the SR mods as soon as possible to sort this out.<br />Hope this all works out for you (and your customers too!)

Its not for you its for others who might not be as tight with there security or money yet. You shouldnt harp on people who have been taken by this. you might think its obvious and you gotta be stupid to fall for it but I think we all learn the hard way about getting ripped off or trusting the wrong person. maybee it wasnt here but I bet you have been ripped off or taken by someone before in your life for something which made you learn your lesson so that now you are not as trusting or quick to jump into something or trust someone. <br />I know I have, and I remember how it felt. I too know more what to look for now but I still feel for those that have to go thru that same feeling. sinking helpless fucking raging mad . its just a totall heart wrenching experience (some have lost BIG TIME).

				Ok.<br /><br />So Ive probably had the worst week any SR vendor could possible ever have. Well i&#039;m sure it could be worse but in my infancy here it feels like it is.<br /><br />However I need your help still. I think SR does as I&#039;m sure I cant be the only one to succumb to this heartless bastard whos making 1000&#039;s off his scam. <br /><br />I have had 2 Linux gurus offer their support and I rebooted my windows laptop to Unbutu, then scanned all ports and everything is normal. So im quite sure I am not being remotely monitored or any keylogger software installed. <br /><br />I triggered the pin reset option on my account MagicFalcon to stop the hacker getting my remaining $3000 in escrow and changed the passphrase a number of time. after rebooting my machine and what has absolutely STUMPED me is how in the time (20hrs) he managed to change my pin when the timer ran out before me and stell another $2100. WTF???? I am perplexed over this. Is there anyway you think he could have done this?? The auto withdraw option was removed when my account was changed from a sellers account to a buyers account. <br /><br />I really need some advice here as I&#039;m afraid my new sellers account will be susceptible to this type of attack. Obviously I will never accept another bloody link again. <br /><br />p.s none of my other accounts have been tampered with, my BC wallets have been safe so if he was logging my keystrokes you think he wouldve gone for the much more i had????? <br /><br />Any ideas

				I know I made big mistakes here. Honeslty ive learnt my trade on the streets and now as someone a bit more mature Ive gone online to minimise risk etc etc. Guys I paid a large amount to be taught what I feel is a lesson of a life time. The reason I stupidly followed the link is because it was a link added in the feedback of a customer who just finalised. Dumb of me to think someone who just gave me money was somewhat trusted. OOOHHHHHHH if I only knew what was about to happen. It was awfull. I still cant beleive he got another 2k yesterday though. WTFUCKEDYFF. How has he done it??? <br /><br />I dont want to point fingers but is there anyway it could be like a rogue admin with access to details still?? If it was why would he have needed the link i suppose. Highly unlikely i guess.<br /><br />I haven t updated any forums over the last week because its been hectic just responding to PM&#039;s about people lost funds when they fell for his FE requests. I have however tried to payback as much as I can whilst still selling and getting back on my feet. <br /><br />Is there someway ths guy can be sucked in to a scam of our own. Cant someone setup their own phishing site, accept his link and give him your details so that when he hacks the account you get access to his and FUCK HIM IN THE FUCKING HEAD. AHHHHH so pissed off about this guy fucking me over and probably soooo many others to.<br /><br />Save me DPR and beat this fool.&nbsp;
