			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello to all <br /><br />This is my first post in the non-newbie section, so i hope this is a constructive post that will have a educational outcome.<br /><br />I have been reading different threads throughout the forum as to which Boot-able OS should be ran for optimum security, obviously the big 2 around here seems to be Tails and Liberte, now for vendors this is understandable as they need Persistent Volume, but what about for buyers?<br /><br />I have had a Ubuntu live USB in my possession for over 2 years( currently running version 13.04 ) and i love the GUI and would prefer to use this rather than learning a new OS such as Tails or Liberte.<br /><br />Now when i initially start my computer with the Ubuntu system, the first thing i do is download TOR, the second is download PGP4USB, <br /><br />(My Bitcoin Wallet runs on my original OS and when it comes to time for buying coin i must buy from a source that requires verification, for this reason shortly after purchasing i wash my coin through Bitfog, which is where they stay until i am ready to transfer to SR) <br /><br />now as soon as i shut down/restart and take out the USB, TOR/PGP4USB will no longer be installed. For me this is not a pain in the ass as they take 5 minutes to reinstall.<br /><br />As i have mentioned i am here to buy not to sell, i require PGP for encrypting my personal data with the vendors Public Key, nothing else.<br /><br />The main point of a boot-able OS is to stop your computer keeping records of what you do isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />I could be completely wrong in what i am saying, but from what i have been reading Tails/Libere has lots of &#039;goodies&#039; that are already set up to run through TOR most of these &#039;goodies&#039; are not relevant if your objective is simply to purchase through the Road.<br /><br />So my question really is, as a buyer (whose house could be raided due to illicit substance being stored and weighed) would i really be any safer using Tails or Liberte in comparison to my sweet Ubuntu? and if so why?<br /><br />P.s If this is a stupid Question please take it easy on me, as i have only just graduated from Newbs-ville. <br /><br /><br />

You can have Tails or Liberte boot off a CD or a USB without persistence enabled. <br /><br />You can run Electrum Bitcoin Wallet on Tails LiveUSB without needing to involve your default OS.<br /><br />Yes. But having persistence means that only the USB has files on it, not the PC. Also Tails wipes your memory before it shuts down.<br /><br />Yes, Ubuntu LiveCD does not have a hardened kernel like Tails and Liberte. Also it is much more prone to DNS and IP leaks as it was not designed with anonyminity in mind. Tails is Debian based like Ubuntu. It would be the closest to a regular Ubuntu LiveCD as possible. Liberte is Gentoo.

				Thanks for the reply Chipper,<br /><br />Electrum Bitcoin wallet was one thing i did see as an advantage, but as my bitcoin spends next to no time in my wallet and gets washed threw a hidden service before being transfer to SR, i didn&#039;t think there was anything traceable there.<br /><br />As for Tails wiping the memory upon shutdown, i believe this is a feature of any Linux live cd / usb.<br /><br />As for the last part of your comment that worries me, enough to switch.<br /><br />Think tails is the way forward then.<br /><br />Thanks for the advice.<br /><br /><br />

Hopefully not on an online wallet. Just search for &quot;Instawallet hacked&quot; &quot;TorWallet scam&quot; or any other of the online wallet fiascos to see why it&#039;s a really bad idea. Traceable isn&#039;t the point of using electrum on LiveUSB, it&#039;s having complete control over your money that is.<br /><br />Perhaps, I haven&#039;t used any other Linux Live CD besides Tails. <br /><br />Well glad I could help mitigate your online risk. <br /><br />Good choice. There are plenty of HOWTO&#039;s in this sub-forum regarding Tails to help you get started. Let me know if you have any questions/concerns about the configuration.

				I plan my BTC purchases, so the amount of coin i have, is never much over the amount i need to pay. I am happy to let 0.02 BTC sit in my Desktop wallet( Bitcoin QT), normally what happens is the BTC i have left from my purchase ends up paying the fee to wash the next load of BTC. <br /><br />I have never used an online wallet and have heard its a bad idea.<br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t have to much trouble with tails, I&#039;m just hoping the GUI is nice and friendly, first time i downloaded a live USB it was a LUI i didn&#039;t have a clue what was going on, thought I&#039;d entered the matrix. :)

				Tails is AMAZING. I LOVE it so much. It&#039;s my favorite OS period. I like it more than OS X (except Mavericks, nothing beats that lol), Windows 7 or 8, and any other Linux distro I have tried. Lovelovelove it. <br /><br />It&#039;s incredibly easy to install, and keeping your bitcoins, literally in your pocket, is awesome. Enjoy it, man. :)

				I use several OS: Liberte, Tails, Ubuntu, Mint, Windows. I enjoy the exploration and learning curve. It sounds like you have it under control. Ubuntu is a great, user-friendly system with the punch that Linux carries if you take the time to learn the security and performance of Linux. Ubuntu forums (ask Ubuntu) have all your answers--most of the time.<br /><br />USB-bootable OSes are the way to go for security--reducing the storage of critical information. I recommend a third USB for backing up BTC wallets, stored somewhere discrete, and of course, encrypted. As a low cost buyer, you pass under the radar of the Feds, but that doesn&#039;t mean these things don&#039;t get passed along to local LE. So never let your guard down.<br /><br />Bitcointalk.org is a great resource for securing BTC, but as with every forum, there is a lot of hair-brained ideas. I am guilty of this as well, but I try not to post when I&#039;m in an unhelpful mood.<br /><br />Good Luck.

				I think Qubes is the best OS for desktop users, hardened Gentoo looks nice for servers. I would use Qubes over Tails or Liberte any day, but it does meet a different set of goals kind of. Tails when I last looked at it was focused on being a mobile, portable, non-persistent OS for use on a laptop at a coffee shop or similar. It had the primary goal of leaving no forensically recoverable traces behind when you were done using it, and indeed to leave no traces behind at all. Now it has persistence and it is more of a light weight portable security oriented OS from what I can gather. Liberte was pretty similar last I checked, although based on hardened Gentoo, including a unique messaging system and with persistence from the get go. Ubuntu is just a regular Linux distro, based on Debian, blah blah blah. Qubes is a persistent OS (ie: not live) and it wasn&#039;t really designed with portability in mind (ie: not meant to be booted from a CD or flash memory stick). Qubes does put a large emphasis on security though, primarily security via isolation. It does this by letting you set security domains, and then by isolating all of your launched applications in a per-security-domain Xen virtual machine. It even isolates your network card and USB hubs, and supports isolation of any hardware that supports it, provided that your CPU has IOMMU or VT-d flags anyway. It has built in systems for best practices, like the ability to quickly open files in completely isolated disposable virtual machines, the ability to quickly set up isolated Tor routing for very strong protection from leaking your IP address or having it stolen by hackers, a state of the art PDF sanitizing system, an isolated GPG system for protecting private keys and plaintexts, etc. <br /><br />Qubes does have some disadvantages though. The primary issue I have with it is that because it uses Xen virtualization as its back end it doesn&#039;t provide ASLR for any of its virtual machines. That means that it is potentially easier to hack an application running on Qubes than it is to hack an application running on something like hardened Gentoo. On the other hand it is a lot harder for an attacker to spread from one application to another. So on hardened Gentoo ASLR might make it harder for a hacker to pwn you via a vulnerability in Firefox, but if they do pwn you then you are totally screwed unless you have layered additional security via isolation mechanisms on top of the default configuration. With Qubes it might be a bit easier for an attacker to pwn you via a vulnerability in Firefox, but they wont be able to get to your external IP address because you will be using Qubes preconfigured isolated Tor, and they wont be able to steal your private GPG key or spy on your plaintexts because you will be using Qubes pre-configured isolated GPG. On hardened Gentoo it might be harder for an attacker to pwn you with an exploit in a pdf file, but on Qubes even if they pwn you with such an exploit it wont matter because you will have opened the pdf in a disposable vm, or you will have used Qubes pdf sanitizing technique to neutralize the exploit prior to viewing the content of the pdf. Oh yeah not to mention that unless you are using isolation techniques yourself, if any windowed application is pwnt with hardened Gentoo the attacker can likely keylog everything you type, but Qubes would only let them keylog everything in the security domain that they compromised. <br /><br />Right now the biggest detriment to Qubes security is the lack of Xen support for stuff like ASLR. hopefully over time Xen will support security features like ASLR, and then Qubes will be even more secure. I definitely think Qubes looks like the best choice for a desktop (as in desktop environment, not desktop machine) user though. Honestly I have never particularly been a fan of either Tails or Liberte, they are neat but I don&#039;t think they really are particularly exceptional. Qubes is definitely exceptional and it is on the cutting edge of the security via isolation school of thought, and extremely innovative.

If you&#039;re sitting outside somewhere, or you&#039;re in a very large crowd and unlikely to be noticed, or the people who own the wifi don&#039;t know you are accessing it, then it would be more useful.<br /><br />At home it&#039;s pretty much useless, especially if you go through a home router, since only your router sees your MAC address.

How do you know it&#039;s even what they say it is?<br /><br />If you put your security in the hands of someone else you are at their mercy. The only true way to stay secure is to implement the security yourself. And regularly check the updates on the products you use Tor, PGP, etc to verify there&#039;s no vulnerabilites. Noone is going to keep you safe but yourself. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171990.msg1238528#msg1238528">Quote from: WingWong on June 15, 2013, 12:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you mean set up the USB via VM or run TAILS in native OS with VM?

Here&#039;s a recent thread discussing some issues (old Java and kernel):<br />https://forum.dee.su/topic/is-this-project-abandoned<br /><br />The security issues are not yet that serious, but if new package updates aren&#039;t being pushed it could become that way. And there are plenty of bug-fixes that ought be taken care of if it were actively maintained. WiFi issues have been a hassle for me (unstable broadcom drivers).<br /><br />I like to run a dual boot setup with Liberte. I&#039;ve booted to an on-disk TAILS .iso image (there&#039;s hacks to get a more standard permanent install, but they break most of the non-persistance features). Still terribly slow to boot in that configuration. <br /><br />I could set up a .onion git repo to work on this stuff. I&#039;ve got a fair number of ideas for an onion-oriented distro based on Liberte... Anyone interested?

				I think (and please someone correct me) any use of a linux system in conjunction with a truecrypt hidden volume should be sufficient.&nbsp; <br /><br />I say linux over windows simply because the open-source nature and slightly-closer-to-hardware architecture lends less probability for a compromise (trojans etc).&nbsp; <br /><br />I say truecrypt hidden volume simply because you may be forced to give up your password. It is MUCH better to give up a password to a bunk &quot;outer&quot; partition in which nothing incriminating lies (for example, put a gay porn or something in it and say you didn&#039;t want your wife/gf to know you were homo).&nbsp; It&#039;s trololol and looks as if that is truly what you were hiding.&nbsp; Having the ghey is not a crime (in most states ::-))

				When you enable the persistent volume, a bunch of dot files and folders in /home/amnesia get symlinked to the persistent volume.<br /><br />My guess is -- and this is purely a guess -- that you can&#039;t have persistent entry guards because the torrc is in /etc/tor, not /home/amnesia. The latter gets mounted in RAM and can be changed, the former can&#039;t be changed to a symlink.<br /><br /><br />

				This can be fixed several ways of course, but they are not as trivial as symlinking files and folders that don&#039;t exist until you log in, which may be the hold up.
