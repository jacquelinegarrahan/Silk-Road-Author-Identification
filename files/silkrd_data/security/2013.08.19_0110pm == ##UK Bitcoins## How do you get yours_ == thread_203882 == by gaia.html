				Here I sit, a &#039;man/women/insert gender here&#039; with cash and no way to get coins without worry. Back in the day (last year) I could walk into random banks and transfer cash and get coins 2 hours later. Then I would use Vlad1m1r who would accept cash in the post until he ran off with his pockets full. Then I found someone who accepted UKASH. Now it seems the only way to get coins in the UK is local bitcoins or bank transfer. Neither or which sits right with me. Is there any other anonymous way of getting coins here?<br /><br />Anyway, I thought I&#039;d put this thread up to get some ideas....please :)

				Why can&#039;t you use the cash option through local bitcoins? I&#039;m not quite sure why that doesn&#039;t &quot;sit right&quot; with you

Organise a deal on LB - Go to bank - Make a cash deposit with a reference - confirm you have paid on LB - Get coins.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not really sure why you don&#039;t want to do that?

				I&#039;ve not used it myself yet but, another member pointed out this IBUX card thing. http://ibux.co.uk/load.html<br /><br />Looks like you can buy the card from poundland and add funds to it at a PayPoint (where you get ukash I think). Then you can use it as a normal bank card on localbitcoins or bitbargain with no trail to your actual bank account.<br /><br />Would like to hear if anyone tries it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203882.msg1469230#msg1469230">Quote from: devilish on August 19, 2013, 08:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I use bitbargin is there any chance that one day it could come back to me and they ask where i was spending all these bitcoins, I use pingit to buy them if that makes a difference<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As it stands, unlikely. Why chance it though? If a package gets intercepted they&#039;d only need to look at your bank records to see you&#039;ve bought bitcoins, don&#039;t know if this would be enough to prosecute but it&#039;s not going to help your case. <br /><br />I&#039;ve used cash in the mail services from vendors on the main site in the past.

				I guess I need to understand LB more then. I thought it was all f2f or bank transfer. So cash deposits at a bank is an acceptable method by some on there then? Great if that&#039;s the case.<br /><br />@tiger....I did used to use cash through the post on SR too. Do you recommend anyone there now? I was going to use Bitcoins http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c536b90105 but he is getting some dodgy rep at the moment. <br /><br />

				I used bitcoins in the past and it was fine, I couldn&#039;t vouch for him at the moment though. I also used BitcoinsUK but I think he&#039;s packed it in now- Not much help!<br /><br />I&#039;ve not needed to buy recently so don&#039;t know who&#039;s good right now I&#039;m afraid. I&#039;ll be looking at that IBUX card when the times comes though I reckon.

				@ gaia if you want to buy bitcoins via SR i would recommend From One To Another:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=post;topic=203882.0;last_msg=1469926<br /><br />She is very active on the forums and goes by the name of PrincessHigh,<br /><br />Believe she is on holiday at the mo so isnt open for buisness.

				If you&#039;re within 90 minutes of a bank just use localbitcoins and instead of bank transfer just head to a branch and pay into it.<br /><br />BTCs are not illegal. Even if you were ever asked to say what you spent them on YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED TO DO SO.

				The website says to get one in Poundland so...Don&#039;t know really!<br /><br />Did a little reading into it, you need to provide a name and address, doesn&#039;t say whether they check them so fake details &#039;might&#039; be alright.<br /><br />Also, it doesn&#039;t look like you can use it to do a bank transfer like you would for bitbargain and localbitcoins, only transactions like if you were buying from a shop, for example. Don&#039;t know if there are any exchanges set up to sell coins in that way?<br /><br />Perhaps not as viable as I first thought, alternatives welcome!
