				I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m the only one with this problem, and yet when I ask the admins at the GPG Tools help desk, I get this dumbfounded answer: &quot;You would never need to do that using our software.&quot;&nbsp; All I&#039;m trying to do is export my public key so that I can communicate with vendors on SR (of course, I&#039;m not telling *them* that), but since they can&#039;t imagine a world in which keyservers don&#039;t run the internet, they say I wouldn&#039;t need to produce a text file with a public key, and maybe it&#039;ll be in a future update.&nbsp; Really?<br /><br />I can do most things in encrypted text just fine one-way, but if I have a question that requires an encrypted response, I&#039;m stuck.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that I&#039;m the only person on a Mac using SR and GPG Tools, so I guess I&#039;m just the only one who hasn&#039;t figured this out.&nbsp; Anyone care to share?

				If I understand what you are trying to do:<br />If you want vendors to communicate with you encryptedly, encrypt your message to them using THEIR public key (they post it in easy to find places). In the message to them add your public key so they can encrypt messages back to you. You may want to ask them to encrypt the messages they send to you or they may not think it seems important. My feeling so far is that encryption is generally only needed for sending personal info like addresses, account info etc. <br />&nbsp;NWN<br /><br />The export function may not be needed. Just copy the entire public key including headers and dashes and then paste it into your message to them.

				Right.&nbsp; I got that part, how to talk to them.&nbsp; But, for them to talk to me, they need my public key, and using GPGTools, I have no idea how to display my public key.&nbsp; According to the support site, the public and privte keys are generated at the same time, but you don&#039;t see the public key on your keyring.&nbsp; And, even though there&#039;s an &quot;export key&quot; option, it doesn&#039;t work when you try to export your private key (or any subkey).&nbsp; So, when I ask the developers this question, they say that it&#039;s not a problem, since my public key is automatically uploaded to keyservers, and future versions may allow me to export an ASCII version of my public key.&nbsp; But, I wanted to run it by folks here, because if anyone&#039;s found an end run around the problem, they&#039;re here.&nbsp; It&#039;s a simple thing.

				Learning GPG was long. If you haven&#039;t worked it out yet...<br /><br />Open TextEdit, right click, click &#039;Open PGP: Insert My Key&#039;. You will then be able to choose your key in a drop down menu, and it will appear in TextEdit. You can then copy and paste this into messages to vendors, so they will be able to reply to you.
