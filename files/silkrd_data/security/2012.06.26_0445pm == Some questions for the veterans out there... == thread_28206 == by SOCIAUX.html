				Hello all!<br />I&#039;ve been lurking on SR for QUITE some time now, gathering up all the information I could get my hands on. I have recently decided to make the jump into my first transaction and/or making a sellers account. I believe I have a pretty good idea of how things work around here, just from lurking... However, nothing speaks louder than experience. So, I have a few questions for the veterans out there:<br /><br />1. I know how PGP works, but what about etiquette? Is it normal to encrypt every message?<br /><br />2. Bitcoins. I have yet to find a reliable and safe way to get them into my SR wallet. Services like Mt. Gox require a legitimate bank account... Should I buy from them, send coins through multiple wallets (possibly Bitcoin Fog?) and THEN into SR? It all seems very sketch to me...&nbsp; :o<br /><br />3. Also regarding Bitcoins. If I decide to start selling things here, how do I safely get the bitcoins OUT of my SR wallet and back into real currency? It seems to me that the dangerous parts are the entry and exit points, as this is where people usually get pinched... Once you&#039;re in the system, you&#039;re generally safe.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it! Thanks in advance to anyone who responds to this&nbsp; :) This is also my first post, so I wanted to say that SR is the most LEGIT thing I have ever seen! You guys keep doing what you&#039;re doing&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Peace.<br />-SOCIAUX

You are right in saying this isn&#039;t safe by any means. I run a service selling Bitcoins to people in the UK and Europe in exchange for cash in the mail. If you live in the US the vendor BlueSkyTraders can sell you them for MoneyPaks which is a quick and reliable method.<br /><br />In a nutshell the ONLY ways to obtain Bitcoins safely are buying them with cash or selling products/services for them.

For large amounts you would need to hire a consultant. Fortunately one of our moderators Limetless works in banking as I do and has experience with this sort of thing. You&#039;re absolutely right in saying that the most dangerous points in tbe Bitcoin blockchain are the entry and exit points which is why if you obtain Bitcoins through sales/cash then your original purchase cannot be readily traced.<br /><br />There are vendors (myself included) who can send you cash in the mail in exchange for Bitcoins. There&#039;s also the website CoinaBul which sells you precious metals like gold bullion in exchange for BTC.<br /><br />Any more questions please let me know.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Thanks so much V. I really appreciate the wealth of information :D<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you live in the US the vendor BlueSkyTraders can sell you them for MoneyPaks which is a quick and reliable method.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Indeed, I do live the the States and this seems like a good alternative. However, I&#039;ve heard horror stories about people being scammed via MoneyPaks, Western Union, etc. How do I know that this &quot;BlueSkyTraders&quot; is legitimate? I suppose I&#039;ll just try and contact him, if I choose to take that route :P<br /><br />Is there any way to know the chances of being traced if I decide to go through a company such as Mt. Gox? Even if I use Bitcoin Fog? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no way to know, but is it worth the effort to seek other means in order to remain completely anonymous?<br />Once again, thank you for the advice. This is all news to me :)

Your case is not going to be helped if it can be proved you used your bank account to buy Bitcoins - a digital currency widely used by people dealing in narcotics. Even if you then used a coin mixer like Bitcoinfog this will simply make it much more difficult to link to you a specific purchase.<br /><br />It&#039;s for this reason I say the only reason to obtain them safely is by selling goods like Moneypaks or buy using cash- obviously you&#039;re based in the US so I have no financial motive for saying this but by all means do your homework on the vendors out there and find one with good feedback!

If you need help with this, feel free to ask.<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Yeah, thanks a ton Vlad :D<br />I&#039;ll do some research of my own on this VPN/bridging concept. It seems vaguely familiar... I think I&#039;ve used VPN for something else before. I can&#039;t remember what it was though &gt;.&lt; haha

I first discovered this when a friend asked me to help her son and daughter to prepare for a Mathematics exam (she assumed because I work in a bank I do sums every day... not necessarily true as you know!) - I found the kids were confused by exactly the same things I had been when I was at school, so knew how to set things right - there&#039;s really something in this, we&#039;ll have to a pen a paper on it sometime.<br /><br />Anyway enough of my rambling, in the mean time feel free to take a look at :<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges<br /><br />This has a helpful video on how to access &quot;public&quot; Tor bridges. Primarily these are used for two reasons:<br /><br />- To use Tor when your ISP automatically blocks access to Tor relays and/or<br />- You live in a country where accessing known Tor relays is blocked automatically (e.g the Great Firewall of China :-) )<br /><br />You can get the addresses of the three latest &quot;public&quot; bridges from:<br /><br />https://bridges.torproject.org/<br /><br />I got into trouble as I mentioned before last time I spoke about this (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27050.0;topicseen) but in simplest terms using a public bridge makes it easier for you to bypass censorship as all Tor entry/exit nodes are publicly listed and it would otherwise be feasible for an Orwellian government/ISP to block access to them, hence the creation of &quot;bridges&quot; which are not publicly listed and are therefore harder to block. <br /><br />As Shannon rightly says in another thread even without using bridges, it&#039;s still not possible to prove that you visited a specific Tor hidden service but I don&#039;t like the idea of being singled out for any kind of monitoring, and I understand that Tor data packets are pretty easy to spot, even if the contents can&#039;t be decrypted. <br /><br />The advantages of using a Private bridge with what is known as a &quot;protocol obfuscator&quot; is that you can both hide your original IP when connecting to the Tor network and mask the fact you&#039;re using Tor at all. In my naivete I was going to offer to run a Private Bridge of my own from a server I had set up but as I stated above the more technically minded users persuaded me that this is something you really do need to set up on your own for maximum privacy - I am trying to write a layman&#039;s guide to this.<br /><br />I can tell you for nothing you&#039;ll need a tool known as obfsproxy which protects you by transforming the Tor traffic between your client and the bridge. (unlike when using a Public bridge). This way, censors, who usually monitor traffic between the client and the bridge, will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the actual Tor traffic.<br /><br />I will be posting the guide for review when it&#039;s ready. I have a couple of irons in the fire but it should be available in the next week or so.<br /><br />See also : https://blog.torproject.org/blog/different-ways-use-bridge<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Personally I think a lot of the BTC buying paranoia is overblown. Drugs have been going through the mail for 100s of years, most of the time it has nothing to do with SR, unless your package was intercepted via a profiling operation linked to a SR vendor I highly highly doubt any LE would even ask you if it had anything to do with SR or look for BTC transactions in your financial records. Even then, what are they really going to do about it? Criminal charge means the burden of proof is on them, and even if you bought straight from Mt. Gox to SR wallet to vendor, they&#039;re going to have a terribly difficult time trying to prove that unless you fuck up horribly and incriminate yourself. Cash is used to by drugs way more often than BTC but who actually feels guilty when they have a couple $100s in their pocket?? Not me... There&#039;s plenty of legit purposes for BTC anyway. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t to say it&#039;s not something to err on the side of caution with, and I don&#039;t buy coins that way myself, but the risk is fairly minimal IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp;

The reason I don&#039;t need to worry too much is firstly that the person who receives the cash is not me and doesn&#039;t know my personal details and secondly a raid of my home premises would not reveal anything illegal.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a lawyer but I think if you were in the situation I described where you were attempting to claim some drugs had been sent to your home unsolicited, I can&#039;t see the fact that you bought Bitcoins, being dismissed altogether, even if they can&#039;t be linked to a specific transaction.<br /><br />You use the analogy of going to an ATM but it simply isn&#039;t the same thing - the Bitcoin is specifically designed as a decentralised pseudonymous currency, the main purpose for which is trafficking in illegal goods. The fact that it can also be used to trade in legal goods might be a viable defence but it&#039;s not grounds to have the evidence thrown out altogether.<br /><br />I have said before and I repeat the ONLY safe ways of obtaining Bitcoins are by buying them with cash and/or selling products/services - anything else you are creating a paper trail. The risk might be small, but it&#039;s very real.<br /><br />V.

And keep in mind that while we&#039;re quite privy to how all of this works that most people in the judicial system are not, and will have a difficult time getting their head around it all, and even more so in believing that you&#039;re using all this technology that *can* be used to buy drugs on the internet for innocent reasons.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Moksha,<br /><br />I think it&#039;s important that we also have an idea what we&#039;re up against.<br /><br />Certainly in the UK (and I assume in the US too) Judges are frequently middle aged and not too au fait with technology. A quick Google will show that the main advantage of Bitcoins is to criminals and frankly you can do without the publicity.<br /><br />From a Prosecutor&#039;s perspective in the UK, by itself it probably wouldn&#039;t be enough to convict someone with conspiracy to supply a drug but I understand US law is much more open to interpretation. <br /><br />I suppose a good analogy might be the kind of plausible denial you can have with encryption. Use of the Bitcoin network can be used to form a case against you that you were trying to hide your financial activities. You could indeed have a number of laudable and legal reasons to do this - my own business selling Bitcoins is perfectly legal for instance but that&#039;s not going to be much good to you if :<br /><br />a) Frequent Bitcoin purchases are reported to the authorities by your bank (as far as I know my bank in the UK is not doing this at the moment) and a Judge decides this is sufficient grounds for&nbsp; a Search warrant of your home.<br /><br />b) You receive contraband in the mail and try to claim it was unsolicited. <br /><br />The reverse is also true - only a vendor who&#039;s a complete fool would cash out large amounts from an exchange right into their bank account although admittedly the amounts are appreciably larger.<br /><br />I appreciate that the above contains a lot of What If&#039;s - I exchange e-mails about this topic often with people who think it would be easier to buy Bitcoins via an exchange than pay my commission on cash they send for BTC - the way I frame is I ask them to imagine that the chance of their purchase being flagged by the bank is 2% - meaning there&#039;s a 98% chance it will be lost in the ether, or the Police will notice and not care, or they&#039;re not monitoring people&#039;s bank accounts in the first place, or they do notice but can&#039;t get a warrant to seize your mail etc. etc.<br /><br />Also let&#039;s say you buy Bitcoins at the end of each month with your salary and use them to purchase enough drugs for the next four weeks. <br /><br />Every month you&#039;re taking this 2% chance - if we do the maths, this will mean that your probability of getting caught escalates to near 100% within four years (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution#Delta-function_representation) - of course the chance is still 2% each time but it&#039;s a little like tossing a coin fifty times and expecting it to land heads ten times in a row...<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
