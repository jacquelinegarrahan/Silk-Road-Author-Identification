				Depends on how security conscious you are. I try to encrypt all of my messages, others send everything unencrypted. You could ask the seller what he/she prefers?&nbsp;

				Encrypt. Fucking. Everything.<br /><br />The fact that anyone would not do this, even for a simple message, just blows my mind.&nbsp; Yeah, it might take a little extra time, but GPG is easy to learn/use, and wouldn&#039;t you rather know that all your messages are stored in ciphertext where no LEO can possibly read them, no matter what kind of worst-case scenario might ever befall SR?&nbsp; The fact is, even if you&#039;re not exchanging order details, you&#039;re still participating in an illegal-in-pretty-much-every-jurisdiction-on-the-planet marketplace, and for all the things that SR does to try to protect its users, there&#039;s always the chance that something will go tits up, so in the end, you still need to take responsibility for your own security and COVER YOUR ASS.<br /><br />And yeah, I know there are some sellers that would prefer that you only encrypt order details, and I know there are plenty more that don&#039;t use GPG at all.&nbsp; Those cats need to wise the fuck up.

I change my keys on a regular basis as I live in the UK and can be legally required to provide any keys in my possession. This way even if LE could somehow get into my inbox on SR, I could argue that the information is unrecoverable as I no longer possess the keys to it. I am referring of course to messages containing information other than mailing addresses which sellers must delete as soon as they&#039;ve finished with them. :-)<br /><br />V.

As a buyer, I really hate when vendors get this wrong.
