				All<br /><br />Like most of the dysfunctionals, misfts, layabouts and junkies who frequent this place I am frequently in the need of BTC within an hour or two&#039;s notice, for whatever reason. I have an MTG account (2 days and becoming more and more puppy dog the master of big banking by the day and 2 day transfers) and an Intersango account (No explaination needed)<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me understand why there are no reputable vendors who exchange UKash vouchers for BTC, taking a small cut on the exchange rate from the point of exchange and a sliding scale fee on each transaction.<br /><br />OK, I appreciate BTC stands for everything governments and FIAT money stands for and the are serious issues around money laundering which could be pinned on someone at the drop of a hat but surely there would be enough UK people looking for quick BTC to earn at least a few quid in the short term.<br /><br />Please feel free to shoot this thought down in flames - it&#039;s late and I need to get off to bed.<br /><br />All I know is that if there were a trusted UK UKash for BTC vendor and I needed some quickly I would be prepared to pay for the service.<br /><br />No doubt such transactions take place day in, day out on a more personal level and inside and outside SR - just wondering why nobody had put their head over the parapet to offer such service to the general UK SR populous.&nbsp; As&nbsp; say, it&#039;s late and I&#039;m sure the naivete of the idea will become fully apparent in the morning.&nbsp; In the meantime if anybody could take a minute to make mincemeat of the suggestion, feel free!<br /><br />Vlad ;)<br /><br />I mean Nonmouse

				Seems like there are quite a few people looking for anonymous BTC exchange services or BTC services outside the usual BTC exchange routes like MT Gox.<br /><br />PM me if you are interested in a same day, one off fee, UKash to BTC exchange and I&#039;ll set something up if there is enough interest.<br /><br />NM

				googleeyed is offering a WU for BTC scheme for only USA. Not sure of the potential risks of this.&nbsp; All I know is that there is a market here where vendors need cash/IRL money of some form and we need BTC.&nbsp; How can we bring these 2 together in an anonymous. efficient, trustworthy way?&nbsp; I don;t want any RL name association with BTC.&nbsp; I understand Barclays are no longer acceptng cash deposits.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure small time buyers will be fine, but I don;t want any association in RL to BTC.
