				I&#039;m extremely concerned with having a high level of anonymity, so this post is coming from that perspective.<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;d say Bitinstant cash deposits are good for all bitcoin buyers, even those that require high anonymity.<br /><br />This is what happened:<br /><br />1) I went to the Bitinstant web site and selected the CVS cash deposit option and the &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; payment option. After entering the amount I was then redirected to a second web site to select a location. I entered a nearby zip code and found a CVS I could walk to. Bitinstant took a fee out of the bitcoin and the second web site added a fee onto the amount I would pay at the CVS. The total fees were a few dollars<br /><br />2) I printed out a form from the second web site and took it with me to the CVS. When I got to the CVS and presented the form to a cashier, he directed me to a red Moneygram phone. I picked up the phone and followed the instructions.<br /><br />3) The automated process on the phone asked me for a phone number, which I declined to give. Then it asked me to enter one of the codes from my form. Then I got redirected to a live person, and had to wait on hold for the person for about 2 minutes. They asked me for a name, I gave a fake name. They asked me for an address, I gave a fake address (the street I gave doesn&#039;t even exist). Then they told me to go to the cashier to complete the transaction.<br /><br />4) When I went to the cashier, he asked me for my name, so I gave the fake name. Then I gave him the money and he gave me a receipt to sign. I signed the fake name and I was outta there!<br /><br />5) By the time I walked home, I had the bitcoin in my wallet<br /><br />The only part of this that I think could possibly link me to my identity would be the fake signature. Even though I signed a fake name, hand-writing analysis could still show that it was me who signed it. But this is a really minor concern. At no time was I asked for ID and at no time did I give any information that could be used to trace me.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone who&#039;s wondering about this process!

				Yeah, but I honestly doubt the store keeps its camera records for long enough that it would end up being used for something like that. Whereas the signature will probably go on file forever

				Thanks. I&#039;m gonna start using this method instead of Dwolla. During the winter you can also wear gloves and extra clothes that&#039;d be hard to detect in a camera. I like that you walked home too. It might be a good idea to park a little far from CVS if you&#039;re driving.

				I&#039;ve had very good experience with Walmart so far.&nbsp; Make sure you accentuate any bad handwriting you may have.&nbsp; No need for id, no need to state what or why, I literally handed over the paper, handed over the case, scribbled in very bad handwriting the personal info, he even misread what I had intended to write as my street name and I just didn&#039;t correct him, yea Rice street, that&#039;s it, and just read a magazine while he did the transaction.&nbsp; Bitcoins were in the wallet by the time I got home.&nbsp; I agree, there&#039;s no need to be paranoid about the camera, it&#039;s not illegal to buy bitcoins and that&#039;s a lot of ground to cover, the whole US?&nbsp; Just make sure you use TOR for bitinstant.

				i have a question about this... i understand that i can access bitinstant using my TOR browser (and the fake IP address that comes with it) and set up the transaction using fake name, address, etc, and that&#039;s all good and fine, but what about when i want to print out that form? should i save the form from tor to my desktop before sending to my printer? i thought i read somewhere that applications that are accessed from the tor browser but are not part of the tor browser can be linked with my actual IP?

				I personally couldn&#039;t do cash deposit on Bitinstant through TOR. The option goes away with TOR. You might want to go to Starbucks. You also don&#039;t need to print out anything. Just write down the numbers they give you and their information (San Francisco, CA, ZipZap, Inc. etc.).<br /><br />Go to WalMart and find the blue form and match the information from the .pdf onto the form. Triple check the numbers. Your info can be fake. No ID.<br /><br />The lady behind me was also doing a moneygram transfer. They do this all day, so there is no need to be paranoid or anything.

				Yeah, I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s exactly proof that you bought (legal) bitcoins if your IP is traced. Anyone can go through that Bitinstant process with a few clicks just to &quot;test&quot; the website and not actually go through with the transaction. My first time failed, so I never actually got any coins and yet I went through the process on the website.<br /><br />Fuck Moneypack. It&#039;s too easy to get scammed and the fees are ridiculous. You should only use that if you have no other options.

				yeah i&#039;ve only bought btc&#039;s a few times, but most were with MPs. i&#039;ve never been charged more than 10% fees (with a LOT of shopping around and messaging folks with listings up), but that&#039;s still over twice the fees of bitinstant and way less hassle and shopping around. i deposited into a bank once, too, using BTCMaster, i believe, and that was quick and painless as well, but still, 10% markup.<br /><br />OFF TOPIC: you must have coin at the ready for 3jane, eh Absurd?! lucky mofo! i, again, won&#039;t have the coin to purchase a full 1/4 sheet, but it&#039;s super nice to see she&#039;s capped a purchase limit of 1 sheet per customer so more of us can get some of that good good.

Even if you don&#039;t print it, the pdf is sent to you and you you have to click through the warning.<br />I got nervous enough about this to buy my bitcoins from the library clearnet computers then start bouncing the coins through several sr accounts, then changing account numbers after the transfers. I have sent straight to SR acct rather than instawallet or torwallet. I may send to one of them first next time though. <br />So, which is really better: going through tor and downloading the pdf from bitinstant (with or without printing), or going through a clearnet site that is not your tor browser enabled computer?<br />I have done both ways so far but think that one may be more secure.<br /><br />I have also successfully used Walmart with the moneygram option (chose pay at walmart option on bitinstant and sent to btc address. You can get some moneygram forms from walmart and prefill them out for future transactions. Then you have time to memorize your fake name , address and ph# and even try a fake signature. always say you don&#039;t have your id with you if they ask to see it. You don&#039;t lose any money if you leave and go to a different store.<br /><br />By the way, I used Moneypaks for my first 10 transactions or so. I finally settled on SugarMama as the vendor. All of these services are expensive compared to getting your own bitcoins, but a lot simpler in the beginning. Use Sugarmama if this bitcoin purchasing has you in a dither. Also. learn and use PGP as one of the first things you do before attempting to order anything other than food or clothing on SR ;)

				Tried this method at CVS today and when I got to the cashier he asked for ID.&nbsp; I had used a fake name and address and I for one would never use a real name.&nbsp; Told him I didn&#039;t have ID and it was a payment for a friend anyway.&nbsp; He said sorry I can&#039;t help you.<br /><br />Next I&#039;ll give Wal-Mart a try.

				This is a fresh review of the Bitinstant Monegram method for bitcoins 9/17/12<br /><br />I went to a walmart filled out the monegram with entirely fabricated info walked up to cashier he filled it out I signed with fake name no ID asked for. The only hassle I can see here is the info is put into walmarts system for future transactions so It can be convenient to use the same fake info a couple of times before switching up I will probably use different info because I have access to different walmarts I travel alot. checked my email and bitinstant had confirmed the transaction only problem I&#039;m currently experiencing is I didn&#039;t realize bitcoin wallet had to dl the chainblock to catch up to my transaction and this is taking for ever the block is 120 days back so I&#039;ve got hours before i can access my fucking BTC if anyone knows of a way to speed this up please advise otherwise method is FLAWLESS. Not the cheapest and probably not the easiest way to get BTC but fool PROOF!!!

				Some advice, maybe helpful for some:<br />1. Get ready.&nbsp; Know your info.&nbsp; Have your plan.&nbsp; Memorize your proxy name and address.&nbsp; Consider wearing something that is typical, but atypical of you.&nbsp; Consider a generic hat you don&#039;t usually wear without identifying features.&nbsp; Keep your head down, but not in a shady way.&nbsp; Modify your appearance in a striking but non attention grabbing why (fake tattoo you take can take off right away).&nbsp; Breathe.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Be casual, regular.&nbsp; Blend.&nbsp; Smile, look people in the eye.&nbsp; You are doing nothing illegal.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />2.&nbsp; Choose your location.&nbsp; Try to choose one that is out of your area if you can, and either randomize or frequent one area for a while to make it seem as if you reside there.<br />3. Go directly to the red phone as if you know what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; Ask for it if you can&#039;t find it.&nbsp; You have a bill payment you REALLY have to pay.&nbsp; So, use odd numbers.&nbsp; It is a bill you&#039;re paying.&nbsp; <br />4. Navigate to bill payment.&nbsp; For the moment, when the phone tells you to enter in the number you have no idea which it is, try the top one.&nbsp; Otherwise you might get directed down to the phone<br />5. If you get directed to operator, stay calm.&nbsp; But talk quietly, with an accent if you can.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to confirm their mistake if the make one, as you have the address (one that makes sense, the CVS clerk sees some of your info, so in case they see your addr).&nbsp; After they will thank you and tell you to make an express bill payment.&nbsp; The clerk will likely ask you for ID.&nbsp; At this point distract them by counting the money on the counter.&nbsp; <br />6. If they remember, apologize profusely and get some hurry in your voice that your wallet just got stolen, you really gotta pay this bill because you can&#039;t use a bank, please just this once.&nbsp; If not, find another location.&nbsp; <br /><br />Blend in, relax.&nbsp; You are part of the people.&nbsp; Everyone has their way to peace, and the road to hell is paved with good intentions, unfortunately.&nbsp;

				^^HighFly, if you are using the Cash &gt; BTC address method, then yes, the SR btc address from the account page goes into that field.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**I&#039;m cross posting this experience to all the Bitinstant threads**<br /><br />Another successful Bitinstant - Moneygram client here. I did a few transactions earlier today and had the coins in less than an hour each time.<br /><br />Just use fake info like everyone says. You don&#039;t need to memorize anything other than the name/address you give Moneygram via the red phone. Seriously, it&#039;s that easy. You walk in, pick up the phone, follow simple instructions, tell them the amount, say your designated fake name/address plus a fake phone number you don&#039;t even need to remember, and that&#039;s it! Finally, go over to the cashier, tell them the name, pay the total, and sign the receipt. Done.<br /><br />Be prepared to be asked for ID at some locations. Calmly tell them your wallet is lost and that&#039;s why you are paying bills with cash in the first place, and they&#039;ll pretty much be forced to continue.<br /><br />It&#039;s not quite as easy as bank deposits, but there are advantages to this process. For one, drug stores are open later and they don&#039;t store their surveillance footage as long as banks, not to mention the shitty cameras and choppy DVR settings they use.

				Bitinstant no longer provides the bank service.&nbsp; It was convenient while it lasted.&nbsp; What I have heard is that Bitinstant has some type of disagreement with the banks, so that might be why.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know for sure, but I would not feel safe transferring coins directly to your wallet at home, unless you have some special setup.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t check your link, but if its that Mr. Mobolina&#039;s(sp) guide, it suggests that you go from bitinstant-&gt;blockchain(which has both anon in and anon out, but each way will cost 1.5% and the last time I did it I may have somehow lost 3btc which is not 1.5% so..)/andorbitcoingfog(sp)-&gt;instawallet-&gt;instawallet-&gt;ad infinitum-&gt;SR<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how much security you get in addition compared to your method, but I am wary of having the coins in a wallet that belongs to me.&nbsp; Of course there are risks at SR, so not only would I not store a lot of coin there.&nbsp; While I have seen a fair coins stored on there , I would also find a safe and secure backup address to send it to.&nbsp; If its feasible to send it to a brainwallet, and you can pull that off, that might be even better.

				Oh no! <br /><br />I wish I had found this thread last week when I loaded my wallet for the first time! I used a false address, but I was under the impression that I had to use my real name. But I think I will be okay. As a friend stressed, it is not illegal to purchase bitcoins. I also read BitInstant forums where the mods stressed that they didn&#039;t report purchases to authorities (though a word is a lot to go on, it&#039;s what I go on here...)<br /><br /><br />The only thing I have to do now is use a tumbler/fogger before using the tracked currency. Or should I worry further for this traceable activity? I&#039;m still trying to grasp the concept of how something like blockchain.info can help deter it. The way i see it, if the money is a ball pinging around different wallets as nodes, it&#039;s still traceable, it just may take a longer time to do so.<br /><br />-Ph

				I did a CVS deposit for BitInstant today.&nbsp; I have yet to see any action on the blockchain.info site, and my wallet hasn&#039;t been funded.&nbsp; We are coming up on about 8 hours since the deposit.&nbsp; According to zipzap, the transaction was complete..<br /><br />Usually, I get em in less than 2 hours.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because it&#039;s Sunday or whatever..&nbsp; But these cats are taking their sweet ass time, and listings are going fast..&nbsp; Sales are ending, etc.<br /><br /><br />Has anyone else waited 8+ hours for their coins using bitinstant?

				Hey MC Haberdasher,<br /><br />I&#039;m having the same problem. I seen a deal on SR. I figured i would go to walmart and send a moneygram to zipzap. Most of the time when i get home, the money is in my block chain account. I did this yesterday at early noon. I assumed it would of been there by now. Of course not, and i missed out on the listing because of this. This is the first time i&#039;ve had a problem using Bitinstant though. Its awkward. Support has not contacted me yet either regarding the situation. I assume one day they will finally arrive, i guess i have to be optimistic about it. ::)

				OK maybe because I am brand new here but why is everybody so paranoid about transferring their own money to buy BTC? It is not illegal to purchase BTCs, is it? So the sketchy part comes when you transfer your BTC to your merchants account and purchase something illegal. At this point as far as I understand it the BTC is impossible to trace unless the merchants service is compromised. Am I right? Also how would a LE connect the dots from SR to my physical address? Not that I would ever purchase anything illegal....

				On the Bitinstant website, below the &quot;Pay from&quot; to &quot;Pay to&quot; where it says &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; is that where I put the SR address with all the random letters and numbers?<br /><br />also, when I go to my bitcoin account on SR, where do I find my PIN? is the PIN going to be generated when I go through the process on the bitinstant website?<br /><br />does it matter if I access and go through the Bitinstant process on Tor or not?<br /><br /><br />

				Bitinstant always worked for me @ walmart, but the one time I tried at CVS it gave the clerk an error, who had never used the machine because this thing was a rare occurrence there. It may be fixed, but I decided that it looks less suspicious at walmart anyway. <br /><br />I did have to wait a while, like 14 hours or something for the coins once, but I think he removed a lot of the fee because I sent him an email saying how this was NOT instant.

				Tried to buy bitcoins today via Bitinstant&gt;Moneygram @ CVS<br />The whole process worked until the clerk tried to process the request at the counter.<br />The payment failed to go through at a location that usually works just fine.<br />Clerk voiced that that it could be due to the bad weather. <br /><br />I am thinking 2 things. <br />1. Can a clerk raise a flag on a payment or claim an error occurred if they believe the activity of a payment to be suspicious? Can a payment really fail to process in bad weather?<br />2. Could this be connected to <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. The bitcoin 10.5 million mark which occurred just hours ago, affecting the transactions?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. The moneygram lawsuit in which they are paying 100 million dollars?<br /><br />And has anyone who recently reported issues seen changes in their transactions?
