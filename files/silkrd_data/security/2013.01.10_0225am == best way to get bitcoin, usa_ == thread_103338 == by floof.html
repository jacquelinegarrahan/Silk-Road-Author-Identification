				Since I am new here as well this might be like the blind leading the blind but I just read a thread on this yesterday so ill give it a try. <br /><br />Step one - create an account at mtgox.com.<br /><br />Step two - create an account at dwolla.com which works like papal and you can use that to put cash into your account so that you can buy coins at mtgox with a bank account, or pre-paid card. <br /><br />Then you can transfer your coins to SR by whatever means you want though tumbling is suggested. It takes time ( a few days) to do all of this but is supposedly the cheapest and safest way to do this. <br /><br />I wish I could find the thread to link you to because it 1000x better than the wikki and any other information I have read. It was an excellent thread. <br /><br />I tried to search it 4 ya but the search bar keeps saying that I just did a search 4 sec ago. <br /><br />I could be wrong about some details but hope it is enough info for you to get in the right direction.&nbsp;

				So I hope I finally have a grasp of this. Here in the US the fastest/ anonymous way to purchase bit coin:<br /><br />Cash deposit using using moneygram&nbsp; to&nbsp; bitinstant ( using fake info&nbsp; but has to be the some for both ) which will deposit coins into my wallet, <br /><br />From there I should move the coins through a couple of other (disposable) wallets or use tumbling service.<br /><br />Finally to Sr which further tumbles coins till depositing onto my Sr wallet. <br />With this method you don&#039;t need a mtgox account at all. You just need a wallet somewhere. <br /><br />Sorry for the questions on this but it is the only part I can&#039;t seem to wrap my head around. The information out there is confusing because there so many different ways to do it. <br /><br />The cheaper way would be to link a bank account to an exchange like mtgox then transfer funds to a wallet then mix/ tumble then to Sr. <br /><br />This method gets you the best exchange rate and fees are a lot less but your coins are traceable back you your bank account and this method can take a while to set up.<br /><br />Does it sound like I have a better grasp of this? Been doing a lot of reading on it. I have used tor and pgp for a long time so I know how to use all of that. Just trying to grasp buying and moving bitcoins.
