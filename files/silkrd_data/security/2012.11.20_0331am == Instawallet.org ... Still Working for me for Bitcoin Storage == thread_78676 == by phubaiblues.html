				I was kind of in a hurry, and needed an offsite wallet to stash my bitcoins in, and I just won&#039;t use a desktop wallet anymore, too many hassles, so I went back to my old instawallet webpage I used to use and had stashed, and had my friend send me some recently purchased&nbsp; btc there. A bunch.&nbsp; And it worked fine, as it always has.&nbsp; I Know the say they are the &#039;least&#039; secure...or some sites say that anyway...but I&quot;ve never had a single problem, and I&quot;ve been using them over a year now...I wondered, well, one whether new people knew about them, and also, whether people had had any problems with them.&nbsp; Once I got to using them, I gave up totally on having a wallet on computer...I do think it&#039;s good to save the instawallet url somewhere safe, so you don&#039;t loose it, as that url is your only proof...but anyway, they&#039;ve done me right, once again....

				Yes, I have two of them and use them all the time, although I had to use the &quot;old&quot; version - something to do with me not having javascript enabled I suspect. People run them down , but they are now owned and managed by a French Company called Paymium that also runs InstaWire and BitcoinCentral, so they are in good hands, as this company has a reputation to keep up and are in for the long term.
