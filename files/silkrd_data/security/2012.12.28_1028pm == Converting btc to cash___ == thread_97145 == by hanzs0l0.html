				Hey guys,<br /><br />What is the best way to do this anonymously? <br /><br />Western Union works but is there enough people who want to purchase via this method?<br />Moneypak seems sketchy as it has to be tied to a paypal account<br /><br />There must be other options that I am not listing here. Any input is greatly appreciated!

				Bump.<br /><br />Any other ways of cashing out bitcoins anonymously? The methods suggested by atlas are area specific and require meeting IRL. Must be other ways to convert btc to cash... Thanks guys!

				No one likes to share their methods because they fear it could draw attention to them when they are cashing out BTC.&nbsp; With all the BTC scammers out there, i wouldnt fully trust advice i found on here about selling BTC anyways.&nbsp; Do some reasearch on the clear web, there are tons of BTC exchanges with a wide variety of payment options. Good Luck!

				Try CaptainMal, he does Western Union and overnight cash in the mail for BTC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only used him to buy BTC, not sell, but he&#039;s super fast, reliable, and trustworthy. Very active on the forums and nice guy as well.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/aea18a79c0

				<br />Sell btc to sugarmama (under &quot;money&quot; on SR). She sends you a moneypack code (not illegal). You can load your paypal account with it. You can get a paypal debt card and spend or do cash advances. Also you can transfer paypal funds to you bank account. <br /><br />In my opinion it does not sound scary. I have used moneypacks for non-SR things at times. <br /><br />I would only use this method for say $500 a month or so. Your btc&nbsp; goes to sugamama, btc blockchain stops there. The rest is simply a MP code and cash.

Sugar Mama has a solid rep as do many vendors. Very fast, and within a short time its on my card for quick spending. I&#039;ve never liked using mt. gox or dwolla, ever. I used them like 10 months ago here on SR when I first started out and it was a pain, I never looked back. The system I currently have works well for me, minimal hiccups if any at all. I never have to touch my bank account this way and am able to spend just as easy with the paypal debt mastercard. Simple really, order $$ on here, transfer to paypal. Done.
