				Alright folks,<br /><br />my name is Monkey. I found SR as I was searching through another site where one of their members mentioned it. Anyway, first thought to mind: This is a gold mine. See for the past 2 weeks, a friend and I have been thinking of starting this business. His reason - needs money for franchise. My reason - pay back student loans, support myself a little more while in school and working part time. <br />I had a bunch of things running through my mind on how to operate the whole thing. We have a business plan in mind, one where we don&#039;t deal to anyone outside 2 degrees of separation from ourselves (I think it&#039;d be 2... 1st degree is our friend, 2nd would be their friends). This would only occur during non-rave/club/party hours.<br />The drug which we will be providing is scarce where we are. If its being sold, it&#039;s being sold with a miniscule amount of legit chemical and cut with many other things, and that&#039;s at about $10-$15. I believe what we&#039;re getting will probably be the best quality stuff anyone has or will ever try in this area, our price will stay $20, or $15 for 60%pure 40%cut. I feel like it&#039;ll pay for itself. So here are a couple things I want to ask in order to keep tails off me and what your tips or suggestions would be for some of the next points:<br /><br />Burner phones. My partner says we shouldn&#039;t need any to begin with, I think different. What about you?<br />How long to keep one before swapping?<br /><br />What do you think about dealing to friends of friends and not random people?<br /><br />What are your good stash spots/what do you think would be good stash spots?<br /><br />Do you think my price is slightly high?<br /><br />I feel eventually we will need to expand past our 2nd degree of separation limit if we want more profit. But who knows, a high price point may deter some people from buying.<br /><br />I also feel my partner isn&#039;t as eager to get started as I am. I told him about Tor, i know about bitcoins, how to get them, tumble them, deposit, buy from SR, find info in onionland. I know PGP now, the general acronyms and ettiquette around the site. All since I found out about this last Friday. I&#039;ve already made my first order and waiting for it to come to me. Not sure what I should do about this... kinda glad about it because I&#039;ve become the asset to him. But he also lives alone and the first package is going to his address which I wouldn&#039;t be able to do because I live with family. Anything I should be wary of?<br /><br />If you guys have any questions for me, on how to avoid &quot;effect&quot; if &quot;cause&quot; comes up, or anything, post! I wanna make sure I&#039;m bulletproof as possible from the start, so the more info and situations thrown at me, the better prepared I can be.<br /><br />If I have any more questions, I&#039;ll post

				Also... having two strengths of said drug could get slight messy. Is it safe to apply food colouring to a powder to differentiate between both? It shouldn&#039;t alter the potency right?

				My advice would be to definitely become a vendor on SR and &quot;deal&quot; that way...I seriously wish SR was around back in my dealing days.<br /><br />The one thing I would have done differently, is to have NOT sold to friends. I found that my friends were the most difficult customers to deal with and my downfall was actually because of one of my friends. He ended up getting arrested on a possession charge and worked with an undercover detective to set me up for a hand to hand deal. I got charged with Distribution of Heroin...ended up getting locked up for awhile because of someone I thought was a friend SO if you do start selling drugs, DON&#039;T TRUST ANYONE!<br /><br />Also, I forgot to mention....make sure you do not do any deals anywhere near your school, dealing in a school drug free zone carries a mandatory sentence and I&#039;m very lucky that the prosecutor on my case did not add that charge onto my distribution charge.<br /><br />Make sure to come up with a plan in the event that you are arrested, have a lawyer and preferably bail money set aside. I wish I would have had made a plan and set aside money for all of that because my arrest caught my completely off guard, the police didn&#039;t file the warrant until 4 months after I had made the hand to hand deal with the undercover detective.

				I think the plan is to buy on SR and sell locally. I can&#039;t offer much advice but I would recommend sticking to just the pure product. You don&#039;t want to have to deal with 2 types of same product. Offer quality good and charge bit more and you&#039;ll still have plenty of customers.

				Yes sirs. Dealing locally after buying from SR is the plan. You&#039;re definitely right @anex45. i was actually just thinking about that earlier today. if a good friend/buyer turns bad or something gets ugly like &quot;Hey I&#039;m your friend, give me a deal or i&#039;ll tell the cops&quot;.. that&#039;ll be fucked up. I don&#039;t know many friends who would do that but that would be bad. Another thing is dealing not to friends opens up the possibility of dealing to undercovers. When it comes to dealing outside of a close friend circuit, we should only be dealing to people who look under 23 or so. Undercovers are usually a little older.<br /><br />I also heard that if you ask an undercover if they&#039;re a cop and you dont know if they are or not, they have to tell you that they&#039;re LE. is this true or can they lie?<br /><br />Yeah @vcalderone, that was just a thought initially. I think keeping it at $20 will be good. I know on our first batch, I&#039;ll be putting a piece of gum, the cap and vitamin C in the baggy. Something to say &quot;Hey, we&#039;re the best you&#039;ll find and we&#039;re doing this so you have a good, safe time&quot;. The gum is for later jaw clenching, cap has product, vitamin C, from what i&#039;ve read, aides the absorption of the product. May be wrong or right, I&#039;m not sure, but at least vitamin C isn&#039;t bad for you and if it does help the process then even better.

				LEOs can do whatever they want when undercover, smoke crack, beat people up, anything, and they most definitely don&#039;t have do tell you they are LEOs if asked - if that was true no undercover investigation ever would work!&nbsp; I think some goddamn movie started that rumor or something and it sticks because people want to believe they can protect themselves in such a silly asinine way.

				If you&#039;re selling pure MDMA caps for $20 with 100mg, you&#039;re ripping people off.&nbsp; Sure, it&#039;s probably the best quality molly they&#039;ll ever taste, and you probably want to hike up the price to factor in all of the possible risks that you&#039;re taking, but it&#039;s just shady.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to sell caps for $20, at least put 180-200mg in them.&nbsp; But that&#039;s all up to you.&nbsp; Just my advice.<br /><br />Depending on the level of your operation, you may or may not need a burner phone.&nbsp; Try to deal only to people who seem to have common sense, or even better, people who are subtle and discreet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, be prepared for people to ask you, after they&#039;ve rolled their faces off, where you got such good fucking Molly.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the answer is clear here, but seriously never tell anyone where you got it.<br /><br />Good luck, my friend, and hopefully you can make a lot of people happy and stay out of jail!<br /><br />&nbsp;:D

				No matter how careful you are, there will always be some risk involved with what you&#039;re about to get yourself into.&nbsp; The best you can do is minimize those risks as much as possible.&nbsp; Some of my learnings (YMMV):<br /><br />Start small.&nbsp; Build your customer base slowly.&nbsp; If you start with friends, this should be easy.&nbsp; If you even suspect they could be LEO for any reason, they aren&#039;t good enough friends to start with.&nbsp; If they are friends, you should also know if they&#039;ve been busted recently.&nbsp; If any deal doesn&#039;t feel right or you just have a bad feeling, walk away.&nbsp; It&#039;s not worth it.&nbsp; You have to trust your gut.<br /><br />I think your friend is correct.&nbsp; You probably don&#039;t need a burner phone right off the bat.&nbsp; The most you should be selling is a few pills at a time anyway right now.&nbsp; This is small time.&nbsp; No LEO is wasting their time on you for a few mollys.&nbsp; Just be smart.&nbsp; If you&#039;re pushing real volume, then I&#039;d start worrying about this.<br /><br />As convenient as it is, friends suck.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; They will hound you.&nbsp; They will ask for a deal.&nbsp; Once you offer them a better price, they won&#039;t forget it and will come to expect it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sell from your house (or your friend&#039;s house).&nbsp; Once you get more customers, this looks very suspicious especially at night.<br /><br />If you partake, do it when you&#039;re not &quot;on the clock&quot;.&nbsp; Terrible idea.<br /><br />Raves are actually your cash cow once you get to that point.&nbsp; You have to know the venue very well to do this though.&nbsp; Avoid the higher end clubs generally.&nbsp; Their security is brutal and will bust you eventually unless you know someone on the inside.&nbsp; Best not to bother.<br /><br />I may be off base on a few items but I think overall, just be careful and take it slow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I forgot the most important thing.&nbsp; What the guy above me said:&nbsp; Tell no one where you got it!!!<br />

				Surprised I haven&#039;t seen more of this topic over the forums, since I&#039;m sure a vast number of members buy product from this site and then sell locally.<br /><br />To answer a few of your questions: <br /><br />Yes, burner phones are necessary. One could argue that if you are selling on a smaller scale, like a part-time sort of deal where you bring in small quantities and sell off to close friends and such, then it may seem as going overboard. However, you need to look into just how easy it actually is for LE to obtain sensitive mobile data from your cable provider. Your name ever comes heavy under investigation, expect them to obtain all of your personal data from the phone company for a very unsubstantial fee. That means texts/emails/phone logs/even GPS location. How far the logs date back depends on your provider.<br /><br />Second, don&#039;t cut the product. Dealers cut product because they don&#039;t get it cheap enough from their source so they must make up profit by expanded the quantity they have to sell by contaminating the product. In my opinion and experience, the profit you gain from having a fire product that everyone loves will surpass the profit gained from cutting your product...but to each his own.<br /><br />Don&#039;t shit where you eat, meaning no sales out of the homestead. Product should never be kept at home either. NOTHING IN YOUR HOUSE. Get ready to throw some good money on a top-notch closet safe, no need for much more if you&#039;re dealing with small shit. Study and thoroughly observe the daily workings of your neighborhood/street. Take mental notes of all the usual workings, that way any abnormalities such as an oddly parked car or that &quot;construction van&quot; that has mysteriously been parked down the street for 8 days stand out.<br /><br />Finally, chose a product with quick turn around and high profit. If you are selling small time, get your product and run it as fast as possible. The faster your reup is out of your hands and into the public, the less likely you are to get caught with it. Having a consistent, steady supply coming in and out is very sketchy and would imply that you are full time.<br /><br />Be safe bud.

				A lot of great great points, guys. I&#039;d +1 all of you guys for being real helpful.<br /><br />I feel like going through Tor, Virtex, Depositing cash, tumbling bitcoins and instawallets, then SR, then learning PGP and ordering would all be a waste if I were to get caught slipping by sending a couple texts about a drug I&#039;m selling, you know? Doing all that work trying to get a secure package then losing it all because I was an idiot to text through my own phone and not a throwaway, just seems stupid to me. Or I&#039;m thinking too far in the long term. Then again, maybe after the first batch, once profits are in my hand, I&#039;ll buy a couple prepaid phones and use them as a safe guard. Might as well come out and say it, I&#039;m going to be selling MDMA. From what I read online and hear through ex-drug dealer friends, MDMA seems to be the gateway dealer drug that leads to coke and such. I personally don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever do coke, but then again, I said the same thing about MDMA 4 years ago. I know not to get high off my supply unless it&#039;s profit.<br /><br />Any suggestions for stash spots? I hear you need to be creative..<br /><br />@ihuntwhales the first thing you said! I was looking back quite a few pages and there weren&#039;t a lot of topics about this so I thought I would just&nbsp; make one and see what happens. I also thought I&#039;d get bashed for making the thread but I&#039;m glad you guys have been helpful.<br />Like I said, my priority is to pay for school, but I also want to save for Tomorrowland next year! plus get a place with a friend, maybe a car.<br /><br />@SmCoop YES, definitely right about the friends thing. &quot;Can I get a deal?&quot; Is the one thing I won&#039;t succumb to unless they wanna buy maybe 10 pills at once. I&#039;ll cut them $40 off or something. But even then, I might not if I&#039;m able to sell to enough people willing to pay the full $20, then I won&#039;t have to lose money giving discount prices.<br /><br />Where I work is also convinient. I drive cars around all day and I can move all around town from the hours between 6AM to 6PM and get paid for it basically. I can use a new car everytime I make a round if I need to deliver. And I&#039;m 5-10mins away from major populations of 18-24year olds.<br /><br />@Happyroller1234 and @SmCoop haha! definitely won&#039;t be telling people how or where to get the goods from, especially since it&#039;s so hard to find around here. I&#039;m trying to be the one name people go to when a big rave is about to come up, or if people just wanna party well. <br /><br />I also feel like I&#039;ve done a lot of proper research on the product and I know what the feelings are like, how long it&#039;s supposed to take before it hits, etc. Telling people to chew gum to keep from jaw clenching, and drinking lots of water especially in hot and heavy populated clubs or raves is a huge thing they should know so they don&#039;t find themselves in the hospital or unaware of the effects and start freaking out about it.
