An international Guide is on it&#039;s way!<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">*GRAHAMGREEN&#039;S CORRECTIONS TO THIS GUIDE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE READ. SCROLL DOWN FOR HIS EXPERT REVISIONS, DETAILED ADDITIONS AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WRITTEN BY A MUCH MORE EXPERIENCED ROADER&nbsp; &amp; VENDOR WHOM I CONSIDER A TRUE GENTLEMAN AND GURU -</code><br />the other guides use mtgox, which freezes your account if you&#039;re using TOR, which is lame. i chose blockchain.info instead because it&#039;s very popular here, and after weeks of intense research my conclusion: blockchain is the best online wallet for my needs.<br />why? tor accessible, cool interface, flexible send options, highest security, etc.<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br />1) Under TOR go to www.blockchain.info set up an account (use a mailinator or any disposable email to register)<br /><br />2) Login to blockchain and click on &#039;Wallet&#039;<br /><br />3) Click on &#039;Receive Money&#039;. there you&#039;ll see your bitcoin address.&nbsp; (a btc address looks like this: 2tnMhKfSAf97f4wJc6dr8toj6iaxy7y)<br /><br />4) Go to www.bitinstant.com&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />- Pay From: select &#039;Major Bank Branch&#039;<br />- Pay To: select &#039;Bitcoin Address&#039;<br />Under you&#039;ll see:<br />- Bitcoin Address: put your bitcoin address copied and pasted from Blockchain.<br />- Amount: whatever your heart desires<br />- Email: put in a random mailinator address<br /><br />5) You will now be directed to a Trustcash site.<br />- submit your zip code and click &#039;Choose Location&#039; for the closest bank to you<br />- enter a fake name. enter your mailinator email you used for Bitinstant<br /><br />6) click &#039;Print Deposit Invoice&#039;<br />- you now have your paper printed and ready to bring to the bank.<br />- this paper has NO information about your phony name, NOTHING mentioning anything bitcoin related..&nbsp; NOTHING is on this paper but an account and routing number.<br /><br />7) Go to the bank with this printed paper and cash<br />- give the bank teller the paper. she will simply read the account and routing number off the paper and take your cash. then she&#039;ll return the paper.<br />- if asked, simply say you&#039;re paying a bill. they never ask.. never.<br />- absolutely NO ID is required. if asked for it, scoff and say you never needed it before and you left it at home.. but they won&#039;t ask.<br /><br />- remember paying bills at a bank is an everyday completely normal thing. millions of people go to banks daily depositing cash into people&#039;s or business&#039;s accounts for legitimate regular reasons.<br />- also remember buying bitcoins is LEGAL.<br /><br />that&#039;s it!&nbsp; the bitcoins will show up in your Blockchain wallet literally within minutes.<br /><br />theoretically now you can send your bitcoins directly to SR now, but lets it play safe and &quot;launder&quot; your coins to blot out any sort of &quot;paper trail&quot;. The idea behind laundering your coins is obvious: erase the link between the coins and you. So don&#039;t be impatient / lazy. Follow these steps to PROMISE your anonymity.<br /><br />1) Go to instawallet.org and it will give you your own secret site with your own unique bitcoin address. make sure to bookmark this instawallet page because if you lose or refresh this link, you lose anything in it.<br />- this can be replaced with any e-wallet of your choice.<br /><br />2) Now go back to your Blockchain wallet and click on &quot;Send Money&quot;<br />- simply enter your Instawallet bitcoin address and the amount, send payment.<br /><br />Now your bitcoins have been sent from Blockchain to your Instawallet<br /><br />The next 2 steps are optional and not necessary, and can be skipped. BUT if you&#039;re meticulous and rightfully PARANOID like me, you should continue with the next 2 steps. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, go ahead and skip to step 5.<br /><br />3) Now open up an Easywallet page, which will give you another unique bitcoin address. This is your second bitcoin address. (bookmark also)<br /><br />4) Send your bitcoins from your first Instawallet page to your second Easywallet address.<br /><br />5) now go to SR, and click on Account<br />- there you&#039;ll see your SR bitcoin address<br /><br />6) Go to your Easywallet that has your coins, and simply enter your SR bitcoin address and press send!<br /><br />That&#039;s it, my darlings! Just be PATIENT and within a few hours or less you&#039;ll see your bitcoins in your SR account READY for your rascally crusades!<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly of the deranged, super paranoid kind you SHOULD use a site called Bitcoinfog. It&#039;s service that takes your coins, completely BLEACHING them for days. once done your coins are IMMACULATELY CLEAN.<br />You can do that instead of the instawallet steps or in addition to them. depends on your level of paranoia.<br /><br />It is advisable to tumble all Bitcoin that you don&#039;t want traced back to you. Not necessary, but advisable. BitcoinFog is not a free service. The service takes 1-3% fee on each deposit. No other fees are in place, no complex calculations based on the number of withdraws or similar. Minimum withdraw amount is 1.00 BTC.<br /><br />The method to use BitcoinFog securely is below, taken directly from their site (bitcoinfog.com):<br />&quot;Ideally you should deposit an amount of bitcoins to the Fog, wait some time (which will depend on how many users are using the service, right now in the starting phase we recommend a week) and request a withdrawal, which will not have the same amount as the original deposit, leaving some funds in the Fog. This way there is no practically reliable way to do statistical analysis on the block chain and link your deposits to your withdrawals.&quot;<br /><br />Some alternatives:<br />- Some people skip Instawallet altogether and only use Bitcoinfog which serves it&#039;s purpose just fine. Bitcoinfog is truly amazing.<br />Just requires PATIENCE.<br /><br />So to simplify the formula:<br /><br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; = SAFEST - most recommended.<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; instawallet &gt; SR&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; considered safe, fast and secure. appropriate for most of us.<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet&nbsp; &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; good enough for some, not for me. fastest<br />- bitinstant &gt; blockchain &gt; instawallet &gt; Easywallet &gt; bitcoin fog &gt; SR&nbsp; =&nbsp; safest, ultra-paranoia stealth ninja mode, requires patience but provides the most peace of mind<br />- bitinstant &gt; Easywallet &gt; Bitcoin software &gt; BitcoingFog &gt; SR = extremely safe, no risk!<br /><br />As you can see, you have MANY options depending on your patience and paranoia level<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">We recommend all new members to read the following fully and carefully:<br /><br />Silk Road Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br /><br />Silk Road Buyer&#039;s Guide:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />Silk Road Seller&#039;s Guide<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/sellers_guide</code><br />Other tips:<br /><br />1) When entering bitcoin addresses COPY PASTE them instead of manually typing in that long address. Always triple check you have the right bitcoin address as your destination.<br /><br />2) Never store bitcoins for long periods of time (for example 1+ week) in TEMPORARY bitcoin address wallets such as Easywallet or Instawallet. These temporary wallets are mostly useful for moving funds around. If you want to store your bitcoins somewhere for a long period of time use your bitcoin software on your OS.<br /><br />3) Do not store ANY sensitive information in a Tormail account. All Tormail emails and draft emails are stored in plain-text on their servers, and you are placing your trust in a third party not to reveal your information the way hushmail.com did. Tormail have records of your username and password - all they are missing is your IP address. When sending mail with Tormail ALWAYS ensure that sensitive information is encrypted.<br /><br />4) Don&#039;t use empty houses or drop locations to receive packages. That kind of shit raises suspicions. Insist that the vendors use professionally PRINTED properly aligned labels with your address and name NEATLY placed. If you&#039;re ordering small personal amounts from trusted vendors using your home address is much that would be less risky than sending packages to an abandoned house. Postal workers know what to look for.&nbsp; Some people have reported success using names of previous tenants that lived / rented your place before.<br />Don&#039;t misspell or alter your name. You want your order to blend in with your other mail as much as possible. Your postal worker will notice a misspelled name; the first time they may shrug it off, but if the see it repeatedly they may suspect.<br /><br />5) PGP is highly important. Never underestimate encrypting sensitive info.<br /><br />Basic information about ESCROW, STATS AND FE:<br /><br />What&#039;s so very important for noobs to UNDERSTAND:<br /><br />Your BUYING STATS mean SO MUCH for your survival and quality of service you receive from SR.<br /><br />If you&#039;re coming on here to scam vendors for free shit, you&#039;re a shit and your stats will reflect that.<br /><br />Once you become part of SR, and you start purchasing your goodies, as a buyer you need to follow SR&#039;s ESCROW system. That way everyone including you can continue to enjoy SR without unnecessary bullshit.<br /><br />The Escrow system is simple and brilliant.<br />SR acts as the &quot;middle man&quot;, temporarily holds your money.. which means the vendor you are buying from doesn&#039;t receive your bitcoins UNTIL you have received your order. Once you receive your order you MUST click FINALIZE. Then SR releases your bitcoins to the vendor.<br />The escrow exists so both parties feel relatively safe and comfortable doing business with each other, preventing risk and satisfying both sides.<br />The vendor is putting his profits on hold until you receive your package and &#039;Finalize&#039; the transaction, so you are responsible to make sure he gets his deserved coins. Obviously this system guarantees the vendor ships your item. So being under the Escrow is the best thing for EVERYONE.<br /><br />The problem is a bunch of lowlifes decide to NOT finalize their orders, so these vendors are out of product and their money.<br />These kind of shitty buyers are causing more vendors to require FE before shipping to reduce their risk.<br /><br />You will see the word FE tossed around a lot. FE means Finalize Early. That means your vendor will get your money before shipping your product. The risk is all on your side in that case. That is why we all hate having to FE because of the risk ON US. A shithead vendor could decide NOT to ship your product(s) after you&#039;ve FE&#039;d.&nbsp; Technically he is fully paid and it all comes down to trusting the vendor&#039;s reputation. Some vendors require buyers with less than 5 successful transactions to FE. Most don&#039;t require FE. Or a vendor could request FE for an international order. All depends on the vendor, the listing and circumstances.<br /><br />grahamgreene: Buyers are NEVER required to FE. Finalizing Early is the choice of the buyer - it is important for new users to realize that they are NOT required to FE under any circumstances. If a vendor will not sell to them without FE, they can choose to use a vendor that does not require FE!!!<br /><br />The reason some vendors want FE is because of a few rotten shits that abuse the comfortable, rewarding Escrow System that really makes SR a satisfying stress-free place to do business.<br /><br />That is precisely why your STATS mean everything on SR. Once your stats show you are a reliable hassle-free buyer you can avoid FE.<br />Remember that vendors SCREEN AND VIEW your stats just like you screen their feedback / reviews.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a shitty buyer vendors will simply deny serving you or make you FE early. Maybe even give you SHITTY product.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a good buyer with good stats vendors will allow you to stay within escrow, and if you&#039;re lucky you might even get some special treatment / perks for being a reliable customer. So work on being a good buyer if you&#039;re happy with your goods / services received.<br /><br />So respect the Escrow system, that&#039;s there to CONSOLE / HELP YOU, respect SR&#039;s simple rules that were made for YOUR BENEFIT, and HONOR THE HARMONY.. so we can keep this thing going forever. So we can continue having honest transactions with vendors.<br /><br />Same exact principles applies to all vendors.<br />We have honorable vendors that work HARD to get their good feedback and reputation. They provide us with good quality gear and professional customer service. There are also few shitty vendors selling garbage or selective scam. The way our stats matter to vendors, their feedback and forum reviews immensely matter to us buyers.<br />We expect remarkable, premium quality product and top notch service. We set our standards high and most wonderful vendors can accommodate our refined cravings and experienced palettes with GOOD SHIT. Those vendors get the well deserved 5/5 feedback and have the forums buzzing like crazy spreading the word about their awesomeness.<br /><br />Lets say your order doesn&#039;t arrive or something went wrong, that is what the RESOLVE button is for. That will prompt a mini chat type interface between you and the vendor allowing some back-n-forth discussion regarding partial or full refunds, reships, or anything else that might remedy the problem. Good vendors truly care about their customers so before starting a thread bashing a vendor, message him/her first or go through the RESOLVE process to hopefully find a suitable solution.<br />Don&#039;t make a habit of asking for refunds unless it us truly genuinely necessary. REMEMBER: having too many refunds, or a reoccurring unusual pattern of buyer complaints will negatively affect your stats!<br /><br />SCAMMERS:<br />Here on SR try to be a special well-bred, noble breed of sophisticated drug user, defying all logic and stigma that the typical drug user has. we MUST maintain the MUTUAL RESPECT and courtesy between vendor and buyer, even btwn roader and roader.<br /><br />unfortunately there will always be pieces of shits trying to run cons and scam. whether it&#039;s on SR, or in the streets. in the streets at least we&#039;re able to toss fairly large sized bricks directly towards their chins / jaw, but here we have something else.<br /><br />This is very important to UNDERSTAND: scamming and any monkey business doesn&#039;t fly here. If you have any shitty intentions to scam on here I&#039;ll clearly explain why it simply is not WORTH IT:<br /><br />The vendors have their own private forum. In their forum they have a BLACKLIST of BANNED CUSTOMERS that ALL vendors see regularly and update it according to their interactions.<br />Once you&#039;re on this list you&#039;re fucked.<br />Any buyer on SR attempting to scam, score free drugs, or ANY other type of remotely shady / scummy bullshit act, will simply be ADDED and permanently LOGGED into this infamous BLACKLIST database of customers NEVER to deal with. But wait, not only your username will be posted but your NAME AND ADDRESS too!<br />To avoid re registering new nicks.. This is to truly keep these shameless, scoundrels recognized!<br /><br />One of our brilliant, more experienced superstar posters &#039; GRAHAMGREENE &#039; expanded, clarified and properly CORRECTED some of the info from my guide.&nbsp; PLEASE READ - THIS INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL GIVE YOUR DEEPER INSIGHT INTO SR&#039;S COMMUNITY:<br /><br />-It should be noted that Mt.Gox only freezes your account when you access it via TOR, but funds will be released once you verify your identity with them; it is possible to gain access to your funds in Mt.Gox, but you have to give up your anonymity to do so. If this happens, verify your identity, retrieve your Bitcoin, then tumble the fuck out of them in order to remove any links to the Bitcoin you bought on Mt.Gox and the Bitcoin you send to SR. There is nothing illegal about buying Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use them or any method of payment to buy illegal drugs.<br /><br />-blockchain, mtgox, instawallets, like all online wallets, can not be trusted 100%. There is no guarantee that they won&#039;t run off with your Bitcoin at any time. The safest place for your Bitcoin is in your Bitcoin client on your own computer, encrypted and backed up regularly.<br /><br />-Guides on how to do this on the Bitcoin wiki:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet<br /><br />-As E-Wallets use an internal transfer process, they do &#039;tumble&#039; or &#039;launder&#039; your Bitcoin in a sense, but it would not be prudent to rely on E-Wallets alone for tumbling purposes.<br /><br />Read more about anonymity and staying anonymous here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity<br /><br />-It would also be prudent after hitting &quot;Get a new address&quot; in both your Bitcoin client and your SR account to check that address on blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to ensure it has never been used on the network before. Though it is a statistical improbability, but possible.<br /><br />-If you want to store your Bitcoin somewhere for a long period of time NEVER use ANY E-Wallet. ALWAYS use your computer based client or a brainwallet.<br /><br />-Brainwallets Info here:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet<br />http://bitcoinmagazine.net/brain-wallets-the-what-and-the-how/<br /><br />Want to explain bit more about the Resolution and Auto-Finalization:<br /><br />-If your order has not arrived after about 13 days, hit the Resolve button. This will take your order to the Resolution Center. Here you will be given the option of asking the vendor for a refund, asking for a re-ship, extending the time-frame for your order to reach you or come to some other agreement with your vendor. Personally, I always extend by another 5 - 7 days because the postal service, whilst usually fairly efficient, does occasionally take longer than expected. If needs-be, I will extend again.<br /><br />-If a refund is requested and the amount of the refund is disputed by the vendor, the matter will be settled by SR dealing with the resolution. If the vendor has a specific refund policy, then you have agreed in advance. If the vendor can produce a proof that the item in question was sent, that backs up the vendor, SR will obviously side with them. However, the reputation of both the member and the vendor and their respective Purchasing / Selling stats will also weigh in on the administrator&#039;s decision.<br /><br />love, GRAHAMGREEN &amp; MRDOBOLINA<br /><br />USEFUL LINKS:<br />http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page - HIDDEN WIKI with all the .onion sites<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18159.0 - All the big clearnet vendors for RC&#039;s <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45678.msg487388#msg487388 - Interesting onion sites<br />http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/ - TORDIR<br />ay5kwknh6znfmcbb.onion/torsquare/ - TORSQUARE<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42088.0 - Official [Insert Drug Here] Vendor Topics <br />

				so after i go to the bank and give them my cash (with my badass cat mask on to stay off the cameras) and get coins on my blockchain.info wallet that i set up on my tor browser, how are they connected to me in any way? why take the extra steps? under the premise that my actual identity is in no way connected to my anon bought coins or anon created wallet thanks to tor, why shouldnt i feel completely comfortable sending them directly to SR at this point? <br />last night i transferred from mtgox to clearnet instawallet.org, then transferred to a torified instawallet.org wallet, then to SR. between the torified wallet and SR the coins vanished. poof! so im kinda sketched out about taking all these extra steps.

EVER. if you&#039;re doing it CORRECTLY, which only means making sure your destination bitcoin addresses are CORRECT then there should be no problem at all. moving your coins arround should NEVER make them vanish unless you mistyped or put in the wrong bitcoin address. <br />I can promise you sending your BTC from instawallet to instawallet, and repeating that process for 50 more times won&#039;t MAKE YOUR coins disappear.<br /><br />what happened in your case is very strange. there have been recent reports of TORwallet scamming peeps so if you used TORwallet that could have been the problem. If you mistyped your destination bitcoin address even by one wrong digit or letter that could have been the problem. Hope you didn&#039;t lose a shitload of coin.<br /><br />Like I said, in theory you are considered &quot;safe&quot; if you anonymously get your bitcoins through the bank without showing ID. You&#039;re right, if you were under TOR when you registered for your blockchain account .. you COULD send the coins directly to SR.&nbsp; <br />But lets say you forgot to launch TOR and you accidentally login to your blockchain account. now your true ip has been logged once. That happens a lot.<br />Or lets say one of blockchain&#039;s nosy admins or staff notices strange deposits / transfers... that&#039;s another rare but legit possibility.<br />Lets say LE focuses in on you (GOD FORBID), and subpoenas blockchain, through their piglike ways of investigation they might be able to find out your bitcoins originated from the bank you went to. <br />There are is of course other shit that COULD happen. <br />In your case, not likely, probably won&#039;t happen to you BUT just the peace of mind I get from obscuring and completely erasing all traces / tracks of where my coins came from is worth it all. At least for me.<br /><br />Also keep in mind once LE understands completely how we are using banks and moneygram to get our bitcoins .. that might affect our situation as well. <br /><br />So sending directly from your main wallet to SR is technically OK or good enough but there are these rare, unlikely shitfuck complications that could compromise your true anonymity. <br />So why not put in that extra few minutes of effort to scramble and blot out the dots... so they can&#039;t ever be connected?<br /><br />BTW, as explained in my guide. I recommend against using mtgox. their whole TOR blocking bullshit is reason enough to not use them. if they suspect anything shady they automatically freeze your account and you&#039;re FORCED to send them your PHOTO ID. if you don&#039;t you lose whatever funds you have banked there. <br /><br />&nbsp;

There you will submit your zip code in Canada and if you see any of the banks in your area then YES, it will work.

				EDIT: VERY URGENT INFO: There have been very troubling recent reports regarding Instawallet scamming. I did not investigate the whole situation but for now, until these UNFORTUNATE Instawallet scamming incidents can be resolved / confirmed you can simply use Easywallet or any other reputable, well known, trustworthy temporary wallet services to mix your coins. Search the forums for alternatives to Instawallet until this whole recent scamming rumors have been confirmed.

				So bitinstant tells me that in my country I can only use bank transfer... I guess this kinda ruins the whole plot... Or if I follow the laundering steps is it still safe?<br /><br />Cheers
