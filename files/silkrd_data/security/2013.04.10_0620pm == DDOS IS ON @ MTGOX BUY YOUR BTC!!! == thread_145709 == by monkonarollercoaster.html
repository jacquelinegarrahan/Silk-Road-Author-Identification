				BTC sellers control the price.&nbsp; When you buy something, here or in RL the price is the dollar value of BTC. So it doesn&#039;t matter what you buy at, as long as you don&#039;t wait to buy your x dollar item.&nbsp; Buyers always look for a deal, but will always take the lowest price offered, even if it is just above the average.<br />Selling is where you see competition - sellers trying to sell just a little less than someone else when they want to cash out, or hold until the average creeps up and their coins are at the bottom edge and get sold anyhow.&nbsp; So if you have a shitload of coins (like maybe DPR) you can sit on that hoard of cash, at a higher than average sell, and expect to sell coins at that price here and there, or you can manipulate the price and &quot;take what you can get&quot; selling lower than average - and with that many coins bring down the average with you.<br /><br />My theory is when you see &quot;last price&quot; waaay below the average, it&#039;s usually either someone cashing out a lump sum they didn&#039;t work for (bitcoin thieves) or someone intentionally fucking with the market (LE or speculators).<br /><br />If someone with a lot of coins wanted to hurt SR, they could hold them until the price crept up (like right now where a lot of people are suddenly BTC &quot;rich&quot;) then drop the price like a stone by selling the horde way below market value, leaving vendors with not much cash to replenish supply.<br /><br />I think this is why it&#039;s very important not to freak out and sell below average unless you absolutely have to. The average was at 200 earlier, and some asshole just cashed out at 160 - desperate or devious?!

				Buy Buy Buy!!!! I was a bit worried when I woke up this morning and realized the dramatic price drop... but I have placed 3 small orders for coins over the last few days one at 170, one at 200, and one at 165! .... hoping it goes up above too tonight... I have faith that these hackers are doing it on purpose to make tons of money, im just trying to make a few bucks that will make my small purchases cheaper! Best of luck to everyone right now it is one hell of a rollercoaster... i been watching mtgox all day... anyone know of a GOOD live feed of the current market for BTC? ive googled it and found a few but they kinda suck.

				At first people were saying that the sudden down spike was the result of a DDoS attack. The attacks are meant to basically overwhelm the servers with demands.<br /><br />When more of the smoke had cleared, MtGox said that it was not a DDos attack that caused a big delay with the trading on their servers. They said it was just actual traffic that caused the lag with their servers!<br /><br />The stated that because of this rally beginning at the end of march they had way more people than expected making MtGox accounts.<br /><br />They said over the course of a month they will get around 50K people registering accounts. Compare that with 70K new people registering in the past couple days.<br /><br />I had a strong feeling that this rally would end yesterday. I was watching the ticker and there was a sudden down spike, usually if its 10% or greater I treat that as a &quot;sell signal&quot; why? Because once there is a down spike like that, people who have an auto &quot;stop loss&quot; for their account will automatically sell their coins, so that they don&#039;t incur a large hit. I just assume that the people who trade BTC seriously have an auto stop loss. That down spike then triggers a snow ball effect with all the BTC automatically being sold back.<br /><br />Surprisingly I don&#039;t have a MTGox account so I don&#039;t actually know if any of the exchanges have a stop loss feature. Do you guys know of any that do? Then I&#039;ll sign up with that exchange.&nbsp; ;D

				Someone was flooding Gox with hundreds and thousands of 0.001 BTC transactions so yes, this was DoS, just not in the usual sense, i.e. LOIC.<br />Gox fucked up here by allowing bots to trade vast numbers of tiny transactions.

				Even if it drops to 20$ a coin I am investing everything. I look at this as long term. Next week it could be 200, next month it could be 200$. Maybe more. To me there is no doubt that this is a great investment.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny seeing all these druggies learn about stocks.
