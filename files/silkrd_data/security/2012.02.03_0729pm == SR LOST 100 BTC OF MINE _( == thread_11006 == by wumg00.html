				&nbsp;I always transfer my btc out of SR as soon as there are around 100 btc in my account and up to now, it has been super fast and worked really well! and then today, I went to transfer 100 btc to my wallet, it said &quot;error, try again in a few minutes&quot; but it deducted the funds from my SR account, it even listed 100 btc withdrawal in my transactions on my SR account page but i have been waiting a while (and usually its rather instant) and nothing is showing up! I msgd Sr but has this happened to anyone else and did they get their money/btc back? I realy cant afford to lose 100 btc!!! I hope Sr can fix this for me or I am pretty fucked! plz lert me know if anyone has had this ahppen and how did it get resolved? thnx everyone and love SR still, i understand things happen, just hope it can get fixed!&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Happened to me last night. Transferred coins, got the blank white screen when it finished, account was deducted by the amount of the transfer but they never showed up. Luckily not 100 BTC but enough that I would REALLY like to know where the fuck they are. Please keep this updated if you hear from SR, I would be grateful. The infrastructure here needs some improvements to say the least ...

See if the money left it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to follow the money, though. SR&#039;s tumbling is very well-done, and will get you utterly lost. You really just need to see if it&#039;s still there or not.

				I hear ya wumg, this sucks for sure! I have confidence that it&#039;ll get resolved, but not quickly and not without a lot of unnecessary effort on the parts of everyone who is dealing with this. I understand that this whole place is really too big to manage and run efficiently given the resources available, but I think that&#039;s why they should slow down on registrations for a bit until they can actually fucking deal with serious issues, LIKE THE VENDORS WHO SUPPORT THEM HAVING THEIR MONEY DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR WHEN THEY MOVE IT FROM THEIR LEFT POCKET TO THEIR RIGHT POCKET. <br /><br />It&#039;s frustrating for real. But what else can we do besides deal with the bullshit? Maybe us vendors could pool resources and coin-roll a functional operation...I calculate that SR is currently taking in BTC at a rate of about $1m a year based on their transaction volume and commission schedule...why is there no competition?<br /><br />Oh, before this happened I also noticed by account stopped auto withdrawing...

				I had this happen to me and no shitstorm was made of it either. Only after a few weeks I got my btc refunded by SR himself. It was about a 37btc and 22 btc transfer which also never arrived. I sent a message to SR that I would be doing out of escrow till the 59btc would have been reached in commissions which I would take then. SR then promptly refunded the 59 btc :D

I&#039;ve received that error before without an issue, but like yours, it said error yet it withdrew but nothing showed up.<br /><br />I even tracked it with the btc address and nothing showed up on that as well..<br /><br />Im sure it will be taken care of..

				Same... but for me it was only a &lt;1btc transfer! So I am hardly too worried about it. I PMed SR about it on the marketplace. To be frank I felt a little petty complaining about losing &lt;1btc, but at the time I didn&#039;t realise others were experiencing the same thing too.<br /><br />Hopefully it will get sorted soon or vendors will be getting very nervous, especially with all the increased trading that has no doubt been going on this weekend!<br /><br />Edit: SR responded to my PM within 24 hours and refunded me, saying they thought they had it fixed now.

				It happened to me the other day, and I waited....and then it showed up in my wallet 2 days later.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing they have a way of identifying and fixing the problem, if/when it happens.

				I&#039;ve had it happen 3 times.&nbsp; First time I got an apology message (which was nice) and they corrected the btc amount in my account.&nbsp; The second time, the transaction took a couple days.. (I think they found my email and un-snagged the transaction). The third time, it took 24 hours for it to arrive, even though I had a few more make it through between it leaving and finally showing up.<br /><br />Obviously its a glitch they are working on. First rule is not to panic, then the second is patience.&nbsp; Should be fine in the end.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think SR is gonna go rogue bandit just yet.&nbsp; Gotta milk this beautiful cow.<br /><br />Galindoi

				It&#039;s pretty ridiculous to me that the withdrawal system has this many issues and that SR is taking so long to get back to the vendors who hold this community up.
