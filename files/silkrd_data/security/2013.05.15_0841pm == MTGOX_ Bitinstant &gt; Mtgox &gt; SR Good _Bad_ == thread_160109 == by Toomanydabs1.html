				Basically, wondering what everyones thoughts are on MTGOX... usually I go the bitinstant route.. but now there not working, assuming having something to do with that dwolla issue... wondering if others are still using bitinstant after that and if it worked for you?&nbsp; I have seen a few posts of people being able to log onto mtgox, but not sure if it comes back up if using bitinstant would be a smart idea?

				I have a friend who uses bitcoin otc, or bit instant -&gt; mtgox all of the time, and has for the past 2 years and never had any problems. He has an AML verified account on MtGox too..... MtGox has expressively stated before that the DEA or other related agencies are the LAST people they would give information to... remember MtGox is located in Japan. <br /><br />Also don&#039;t forget, yes MtGox is a business, but they are also huge supporters of bitcoins, obviously. The entire premise of bitcoin is that it is unregulated and they know they would lose a LOT of customers if they started giving away user information to law-enforcement agencies.

				You mean Bitinstant -&gt; MtGox -&gt; SR?<br /><br /><br />Well MtGox appears to be done right now, so I don&#039;t think any deposits will go through. If you used bitinstant just always make sure to keep your receipts until you get your money. They&#039;re a pretty good company themselves.
