				ON SR Discussion boards.. Sugarmama apparently just lost a lot of coins to a scam. Don&#039;t transfer or upload any BTC&#039;s. Suggestions? I&#039;m wondering if logging out of my account would help or hinder. Just want to be safe

				She also just posted that she has got in touch with DPR and he is aware of the issue. She also said that it&#039;s back to business as usual for her. There&#039;s a lot of speculation as to what happened but if she&#039;s comfortable with what&#039;s going on I would hold out before I label it a scam. It very well may be, but with all the paranoia already in the forums improperly labeling this could turn into a mess. Fast. <br />With the info currently available it seems safe to use the site. It wouldn&#039;t hurt to not make any BTC transactions until further info is released. No need to compound any problems that may exist. Hopefully this will be addressed soon but in the meantime it&#039;s important to only present accurate information and let everyone make their own decision as to what&#039;s going on.
