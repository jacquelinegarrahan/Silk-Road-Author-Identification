				They can&#039;t do anything about bitcoin itself, all they&nbsp; can do is throw a monkeywrench into the exchanges, make them jump through hoops and whatnot. Sure that will be bad for people wanting to get BTC or cashing them out in this country. But there is always localbitcoins.com.<br /><br />I defy you, you senate fuckers, to take us down. You&#039;ll go down first, you weasels.<br /><br />goblin

				Oh no, now all bitcoin related stuff will move to Russia and China. Oh nooooooooo. Big fucking deal. Pretty soon the US is going to realize they can no longer control every aspect of the world with the rise of the rest of the world. In another 10 years the US will be nothing more then one of many big players on a big stage and will no longer be able to control everything about the world.

I think that has kind of already happened...we just don&#039;t know it yet. Look at oil, for example...before we were the big player but now the Chinese are driving the market IMO. We are broke and our infrastructure is busted down...all the developing countries are building newer and better things than we have. I saw an article about our power grid awhile back and it mentioned how inefficient ours was and that China was building one like 80% more efficient or something ridiculous. Not good.

				^^^ Actually we drive the oil market now and for decades to come because our recent shale production. Last week it was in the news the the Saudi Oil Ministry was kind of in a panic saying how US shale was going to bankrupt their country unless they started to diversify quickly..... Oil not withstanding, the rest of the world I feel is starting to feel they can say no to the US. It is so nice to see a nice little country like Uruguay give the US the middle finger and pull out of the UN drug convention treaty :-) Warm and fuzzy feeling :-)

This seems a little bit harsh but the main point is at least they have balls to stand up and have nothing to lose.<br /><br />Americans or let&#039;s just say the rest of the world, are just too damn indoctrinated and think inside the (match) box, people with idea&#039;s and that dare to think outside the box are just crazy.&nbsp; I wonder how the world would look without the government taxing us 80% of our money, even shitty jobs at McD&#039;s or cleaning would make a decent amount of money.<br /><br />And the whole war on drugs, don&#039;t let me laugh, the whole USA is build out of drug money and seized money. If people would do everything correctly, don&#039;t deal, pay all their taxes, that shit would crumble down like a 3 year old cookie.<br /><br />If i personally would have the choice i would say: I don&#039;t pay taxes, i don&#039;t pay insurance, i don&#039;t want any help from you. When i have problems i will figure it out myself. <br />Trust me, if you don&#039;t pay taxes no nothing you will make so much money that you can start an insurance jar for yourself. <br />
