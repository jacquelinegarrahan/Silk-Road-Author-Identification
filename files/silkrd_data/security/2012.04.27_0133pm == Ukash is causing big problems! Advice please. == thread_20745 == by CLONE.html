				Hi there, first of all let me make one thing very clear: i am an idiot.<br /><br />Now that that&#039;s out of the air lets move on. I am a respected vendor, but for obvious reasons I made this fake forum account.<br /><br />A guy from the UK offered me Ukash vouchers in order for my product. Because I was in need for some fast cash I accepted this offer. I did spread the vouchers (which were many) over different websites, unfortunately two of those websites are causing problems now. One even send me this e-mail telling me they forwarded my case directly to Ukash, because they get a lot of police inquiries about withdrawals via Ukash......<br /><br />The other website has been quite ever since I tried to withdraw my money.<br /><br />I am really in need for some advice here guys. If you really know what you are talking about and can give me helpful advice I am even willing to send out a few bit-coins.<br /><br />

				Hi guys,<br /><br />I received a mail from the casino website that send my info to UKASH a week ago. The casino now wants me to send them the purchase receipts of the UKASH vouchers. Obviously I don&#039;t have those receipts, but what should I answer them? I really have no clue, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

				Fuck you guy&#039;s are doing it wrong. Use exchangers to do this on foreign exchange forums, not websites.<br />http://www.exchangemoneyplace.com/verified-digital-currency-exchange/<br /><br />Even those guy&#039;s now are starting to stop taking Ukash and PSC because of all the scams. Idiots are selling vouchers for credit cards online and carders are getting their hands on them, and side channel attacking Ukash merchants and stealing their codes.<br /><br />Anywhere else will want original receipts scans to prove you bought it. Been like this for almost 2yrs now<br />Tell the guy somebody gave you those codes to exchange game gold while you were playing Second Life or WoW (don&#039;t mention bitcoins or Liberty Reserve) and say cancel the transaction. Go to that above forum and cash it out there, but probably still have problems.<br /><br />Gotta stop taking Ukash. It&#039;s a RIPOFF and too much fraud now. There are some Bitcoin-&gt;Ukash on #bitcoin-otc&nbsp; but they want scans too usually<br /><br />

				Another major problem with Ukash is if the voucher isn&#039;t valid, the customer accuses you of scamming them. It&#039;s very real possibility to get invalid vouchers through Ukash all the time it&#039;s a shit system that needs to die. <br /><br />Just take bitcoins, tell them to go to bitcointalk.org and cash their vouchers on their own, or sign up for ECO banking at ecardone.com and keep the receipts

The money is still on the casino website, so it&#039;s not like we can cancel anything. They just want us to show them the purchase receipts before they will allow us to withdraw the money.. which we dont have, who keeps the receipts anyway?<br /><br />Should I go with the WoW story? I mean it&#039;s a lot of cash, its not just 100USD lol.

				......<br /><br />EDIT.. wait.. you already deposited all the vouchers on a gambling site then immediately tried to cash out? Derp. You may be screwed. Plead you are a dumb American who bought PaysafecardsUSD in shopping mall and some guy traded you Ukash vouchers for them so you could play some online poker or you bought them online. That&#039;s probably not going to work. I expect you will have to come up with original receipts from that guy who bought off you it&#039;s too late now they have the money seized and only scans will release them. Maybe you can pay for fake scans on a carding site but that&#039;s really risky, they may call the cops then.
