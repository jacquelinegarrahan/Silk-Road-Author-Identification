				I have gpg4win (Kleopatra) on my system. But cant properly figure out how to use it. Could someone guide me through the process of creating my own PGP key &amp; sending my address encrypted to vendors.<br /><br />Sorry for this most basic of questions, but i cant for the life of me figure out what to do&nbsp; ::)

				I&#039;d recommend using GPG4USB, you can find a tutorial written by Astor here: http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/

				Thanks man thats helped greatly &amp; i&#039;m already getting the grips of using it. I&#039;ve got my own PGP key, i&#039;ve learnt how to encrypt messages. But when you&#039;re encrypting something and on the right it has the list of who to encrypt for. I take it i need to add each vendors pgp key &amp; &quot;encrypt for: (whichever vendor)&quot;. And that will be the job done for encrypting name and address right? Sorry to be so slow getting the hang, just want to make sure i&#039;m doing it right.<br /><br />And with only my PGP key people will be able to send me their name and address encrypted? ( I only ask as its the main reason im interested in pgp is because i&#039;m opening a vendor account soon). Also, do all pgp encryption softwares work with eachother? Like someone using a different program to me will still work fine?<br /><br />cheers :-)
