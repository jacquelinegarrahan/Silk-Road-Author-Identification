				http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/open-market/<br /><br />thankfully I never ordered anything from celtic but I know several who did. In fact it makes me think that this might have been what led to Enelysions bust, as I am pretty sure he obtained fake ID&#039;s from celtic, after which he had semi-legal shipments of research chemicals intercepted, after which he was put under surveillance and eventually raided etc. I don&#039;t find it much of a stretch that the original intelligence that got his bulk research chemical shipment flagged is that it was to a box opened with a celtic fake ID. This shows a multi stage investigation actually, from the compromise of a fake ID vendor, the secret service taking over and selling ID&#039;s for multiple years, a big drug vendor obtaining such an ID, getting a shipment from China flagged because of it then located put under surveillance and busted with million dollars in drugs in money. <br /><br />There is always huge risk with fake ID since you need to send a picture of yourself to the vendor and of course they can then flag all of your packs if they happen to be malicious. I think we should spend the rest of this thread discussing how we can minimize the risks of using fake identification for box registration, or even if we should phase out fake ID boxes in favor of using random mailboxes on the street and intercepting incoming mail prior to a legitimate resident.

				How is it not possible to get mail sent to your house or to someone who would know you and rat you out.<br /><br />If I could be in the situation where once I pick up my package, everything is done and I know nobody never knew who I was, that would be great. But is it possible?

				I don&#039;t think any big importers would feel comfortable getting shit sent right to their houses. I can tell you 100% with certainty that if fake ID is what led to the down fall of enelysion, that without fake ID his down fall would of been years prior to that. It is still speculation if working with celtic is what got his box flagged in the first place, but I do know for sure that he got at least some of his fake ID&#039;s from celtic. It really leaves a sick feeling in my stomach knowing that celtic was secret service though, simply because he was one of the big fake ID vendors to do business with the drug scene. Who knows how many interceptions have been tied to that now, I can think of at least two big interceptions that could have been to boxes registered with celtic ID&#039;s.

				If you are a big time vendor it is only safe to make sure you never get any drug sent to your house, ever. If you were to get raided for something like even accepting a small personal amount of coke or weed you can be fucked.<br /><br />One of the first step for a vendor has to be making sure you can accept packages anonymously and run, so that&nbsp; shipment is never connected to you.<br />How is that done though?

				Motherfucking Babylon!<br /><br />This is most certainly a troubling strategy. When a &quot;trusted&quot; vendor turns out to be Secret Service, its a good reminder that you can&#039;t &quot;trust&quot; anyone in this game. <br /><br />The Atlantis DEA honeypot theories are particularly intriguing, when viewed in this light.<br /><br />Another question (raised in the article as well) is the entrapment issue. Manufacturing and selling fake ID&#039;s is clearly a crime, since they indicted a lot of people for just that. It will be interesting to see if this holds up in court or not. Whichever way it goes, it will have a lot of implications for us here in the illegal drugs black market.<br />

				Yeah, I meant the large kiosks of mail boxes. If you walk up to a single mail box in front of a house, there is a much higher chance the neighbors will notice and get suspicious, even if the resident isn&#039;t home. You&#039;d want to pick mail boxes in large kiosks at apartment complexes. Nobody remembers everyone there. Of course those are locked, but I was talking to a few people about this very problem a few days ago. One of them had lock picking experience and said those mass produced boxes shouldn&#039;t be hard to open.<br />
