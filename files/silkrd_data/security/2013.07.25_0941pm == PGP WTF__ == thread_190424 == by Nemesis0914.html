				Use Tails and you&#039;ll probably only need 5 min of exploring these forums to get it right.&nbsp; Seems windows users have more trouble with PGP.&nbsp; Stick with Tails/linux and things will get easy for you.&nbsp; You can also configure Thunderbird to use your tormail account and with the enigmail add-on it make PGP encryption and signing almost point and click simple.&nbsp; Switch to tails and you&#039;lss never look back.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s not hard bro, stick it out and if you want to understand more than 90% of the vendors here grab a copy of Michael Lucas&#039;s book PGP and GPG for the practical Paraniod.&nbsp; It&#039;s the bible and easy to read and implement.&nbsp; Highly recomended.

				tottenham01 - i appreciate the dread of having to learn it, shit when i tried i needed a couple of aspirin before it was over - then someone gave me a basic &quot;paint by the numbers&quot; tutorial and then i found astor&#039;s tutorial - with either of those, it&#039;s a 15 minute affair<br /><br />one thing to keep in mind, when you set up GPG4USB, you will end up generating a &quot;key pair&quot; consisting of a public key and a private key. When you comm with someone, they will need your public key to use to encrypt their msg to you, at their end - but only the private key you have in your computer will decrypt that msg. Similiarly, when you want to respond to them, you&#039;ll need their public key to encrypt the msg, that only they can decrypt at their end using their private key. <br /><br />when someone gave me that synopsis, it all made sense<br /><br />hope that helps

				I just want to say - stick with it. I tried countless times to make it work on my glitchy system, and combined with having ADD it was quite difficult to sit myself down and work through all the bumps and error messages. I sought help from a computer master and together we figured out the workarounds to make it function properly on my computer, and I couldn&#039;t be happier.
