				Can I please have some opinions on the best way to acquire bitcoins? I am new and I have done about 3 days of researching, but the bitcoin process is what always gets me. I don&#039;t mean to be a hassle, but I just want to be sure i do this the easiest, and safest way. Any opinions or tips are greatly appreciated. Like I mentioned, I have read many different things from different people, some say to go to walmart money center and get them? others say to buy from vendors, and then I also hear people say bitinstant, but i keep hearing bad things followed by good things about bitinstant, so i&#039;m lost on what to believe. Once again, I apologize in advance if it is annoying to keep seeing people asking the same old questions, but I just want to make sure I am doing this right. Thank you all.

However, you must always be wary of scams and the like.<br />MtGox can be found at MtGox.com and help using it can be found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=62789.0<br /><br />When you go to use bitcoins, you should be careful not to leave a trail.<br /><br />Use wallets. Buy bitcoins with the money of a friend if you can, or family preferably. Then transfer the bitcoins to one of these wallets. They&#039;re all over. Let me know and I can link you to a few trusted ones.<br /><br />That wallet will be disposable for buying bitcoins. Once you transfer the funds out, delete it.<br /><br />Then you transfer funds to another wallet. This can be your main one. Have a very strong password, and don&#039;t delete it.<br /><br />Once you&#039;re ready to buy, you can transfer from your main wallet to a temporary (delete it after) wallet for transactions. Then, however the protocol for buying on the site you&#039;re buying from works, you&#039;ll probably transfer funds to a wallet you keep with them. Use this only for money you&#039;re about to spend.<br /><br />Silkroad uses a wallet which you put bitcoins in and then spend out of. It&#039;s convenient. There are lots of guides on buying on SR so I&#039;m not going to go into it. A quick search will reveal all you need to know.<br /><br />That guide is a general overview, and it goes through my personal, medium-level paper-trail-reduction system. :P Use that when making purchases.<br /><br />Bitcoins and SR themselves are not illegal, but depending on where you are might arouse some suspicion so if you have to let on that you&#039;re into bitcoins, at least cover the trail to SR or you&#039;ll have someone looking at you a bit closer.<br /><br />I hope this has helped. Feel free to PM me with any more questions you may have.<br /><br />- The Consultant
