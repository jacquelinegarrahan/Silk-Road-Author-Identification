				Used this same method just last night. Worked perfect. Coins showed up instantly in Instawallet. <br /><br />This morning I do the same thing, but the coins never showed up in my Instawallet. I bookmarked the url, saved the Instawallet address. I know I did it right because in my transaction history on Mt.Gox, it shows that I made a withdrawal to the same address as my Instawallet. <br /><br />Has this happened to anybody else? Mt.Gox is on JST so no support help from them for a few more hours at the earliest. I&#039;m kinda freaking out because this was a good chunk of coin that is nowhere to be found at the moment.

				you can try going to blockchain.info and inputting the wallet address, that will trace the transaction and you will be able to see if mtgox actually sent the btc or not.

				For both websites it says &quot;No transactions found.&quot;<br /><br />Does this mean Mt.Gox never sent the coins?

				no, they always straighten it out, just message support, tell them that no transactions show up in the block chain, they&#039;ll fix it, but be aware they put a lot of effort into pushing the problem back on you, so make sure to let them know you have already confired their system did not complete the transaction

I did let them know that I had contacted Instawallet and they have no record of any coins being sent. So far nothing, but I think they are just opening up shop now. Will wait impatiently.........<br /><br />Thanks for the responses guys.
