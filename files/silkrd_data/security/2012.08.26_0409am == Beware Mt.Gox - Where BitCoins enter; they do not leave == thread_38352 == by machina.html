				It appears that Mt.Gox has become a large enough player in the BTC exchange market that they became &#039;institutionalized&#039; and bowed to foreign pressures for &quot;anti-money laundering&quot; (AML) regulation. Which would be OK if they were serious about this. However, they are not. Mt. Gox has arbitrarily and unilaterally blocked me from accessing approximately $1,000 worth of my BTC&#039;s held by them.<br /><br />Case in point: I opened an account there to use to transfer some e-currencies. I accessed the site through a paid-for VPN, never once through Tor, which is against their ToS. I accessed the site on several occasions before putting any currencies into my account, and received no communications regarding a flagging of my account, the need for verification of my account, or anything other than that I could interface with their website freely and accessibly.<br /><br />Accordingly, I deposited some currencies gradually and processed exchanges through their platform. (Learned mistake) I did not first verify their reputation by withdrawing an initial small amount. Accordingly, a balance built up in my account. Finally, I did want to withdraw, and so I entered information to process a withdrawal, well under their stated amounts that would trigger verification procedures.<br /><br />Suddenly, my account is more suspect than a Jew at a Nazi rally. They accused me of having multiple accounts, presumably because my IP had been used by someone else to create an account. Suddenly, I too am required to submit verification procedures, despite having only one account and requesting a withdrawal well within their ToS for unverified accounts. Suddenly, Mt. Gox &quot;MUST abide by the law&quot; and &quot;verify all accounts to be in accordance with AML.&quot;<br /><br />Is that right Mt. Gox? Well you don&#039;t seem to be asking for verification when you allow people to put money INTO your platform. You don&#039;t seem to practice Know Your Customer procedures as practiced in the USA. You don&#039;t ask questions about where the money is coming from.... These are all parts of good AML practice.<br /><br />So, long story short... Market forces brought Mt.Gox to the top. And now, they&#039;ve turned on the portion of their customer base that believes BitCoin should be as it was made for - an ANONYMOUS and FREELY trade-able digital currency. May their reputation be spread, and may market forces bring them to the bottom.<br /><br />Fuck you Mt. Gox, for poisoning the spirit of what BTC is.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				More generally than MtGox, that&#039;s the favorite trick of a lot of new on the block banks, to be delighted to accept black market money, and then to be&nbsp; ultra leery of giving it back out again. If you study prisoner&#039;s dilemma (game theory), you&#039;ll say the bank has played a &quot;Defect&quot; move. The best policy in most cases is an algorithm called Tit-for-Tat. This is where you just stop Cooperating with them. i.e. stop doing business there and move it to elsewhere.<br /><br />It sucks that your money is under lock and key. However this is&nbsp; a valuable lesson to you :<br /><br />1. Diversify. The guys at Intersango didn&#039;t do this either, they relied on 1 provider to send them cash as electronic credit, MetroBank and they lost a lot more than you because of it. <br /><br />2. Don&#039;t use the Tor network with MtGox. (I know you know this, just pointing it out to the others because it&#039;s probably the most common reason for account freezing), you should route your Tor traffic via an ip address you know wouldn&#039;t be used by anybody else. It is seriously bad luck that somebody else was using your VPN for MtGox.<br /><br />It&#039;s hilarious actually that reusing an ip address leads to an account being frozen, you surely can&#039;t scale that up without interruptions in service for everybody, I mean ipv4 space is limited and ISPs have to continually recycle the same old ip addresses with DHCP they assign to you.<br /><br />It has frequently come to my attention that English and Japanese share a common characteristic, not all, but many of them.&nbsp; That&#039;s that they think of running a business as essentially adhering to a series of fixed rules. They are in the habit of continually kowtowing to authority, even when completely unnecessary. I attribute this, literally, to their countries becoming more socialist over time. Yes, I consider that a character flaw. I think their ancestors would be abhorred by this generations weak minds.&nbsp; Pro statist socialists are some of the most stupid people I have ever meet in my life, it would be a pleasure to purge them from the earth. It is difficult to adhere to a principal like NAP when faced with such thinking. /pinochet pine<br /><br />--<br /><br />tldr: MtGox is a piece of shit platform. If you all stop doing business with them, than we can kill their market share stone cold dead. Maybe you can make a thread to encourage people to take a Do Not Use MtGox pledge or something. You could call yourselves the AGoxs or something (sounds like a pokemon!).

				All good points.<br />I&#039;ve been both scammed by buyers and sellers while doing commerce among the interwebz (and I don&#039;t just mean SR, but all the way back to when eBay was new. Fortunately such cases have been the exception.); but this is the first time I&#039;ve been seriously scammed by what I presumed was a legitimate intermediary.<br /><br />...Comes with the territory I suppose! I just wish I could have learned my lesson at a lesser tuition bill :(

				Would you be able to verify your account then withdraw all your bitcoins? If you could do this then maybe switch to another bitcoin provider..<br />Sorry if this is a stupid suggestion just trying to help :)

				Can you get a friend who&#039;s totally crime-free to verify for you? Then you can make the withdrawal and close your account!

				I&#039;ve never used mtgox. It seems completely pointless when you can send bitcoins directly to a btc address.
