				How might one wipe a computer clean of any trace of tor? I know deleting the files won&#039;t totally wipe every piece of memory from the system, but is there a way to do this without formating the hardrive? Or is formating the hardrive the only way?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Even formatting won&#039;t remove all traces, since formatting rewrites just certain parts of the drive (metadata for the new filesystem).<br /><br />The way to remove all traces would be to overwrite the entire drive with random data, and if you&#039;re extra paranoid, do it two or three times. If you&#039;ve never repartitioned that drive, then you only need to do this for the partition which had Tor. For extra paranoia credit, do the same for any swap partitions, since they could contain bits of the Tor software too.<br /><br />The real question is why delete Tor in the first place? It&#039;s completely legal (in most countries) and there are plenty of legitimate uses for it. The only reason I can imagine to destroy any evidence of having Tor is if you&#039;re passing through border control into a country with strong censorship (China, Syria, USA, Iran, etc...) and don&#039;t want to have them delay you for hours while they copy all your data and &quot;interrogate&quot; you with a blunt object.

				Remove traces of TOR? Are you seriously that intimidated by Storm Troopers and Politicos?<br /><br />Seriously, do you think the Founding Fathers wanted to wipe their minds from thinking about freedom? Liberty? Justice?<br /><br />This thread is toxic, just like anyone that abandons TOR when the temperature rises. Do you now know what TOR is about: privacy and security. There is nothing criminal about TOR. The only real crime here is the possible future in which possessing TOR source code is criminalized.

Some very tiny will still remain but you will make life very very hard for whoever would like to recover the data from them; if then the data you delete was encrypted (and you should always use encryption) then you have nothing to worry about.

				$125 for a brand new 1 TB Hard drive. List all the programs you need to reinstall, get the license/disc/downloads figured out. Then just remove the hard drive, insert new one, and start fresh. <br /><br />Once you are confident you got everything you needed without traces of tor, drill a few holes in the old HD, burn it, soak it, then watch your garbage man dump someone&#039;s trash in a different neighborhood into the truck with your HD and drive away. <br /><br />I know everyone likes format, defrag, etc etc, but $125 for a new drive that most certainly won&#039;t have traces of your old data gave me a piece of mind.

				Truecrypt can be used to do a 3 pass overwrite with random data while it encrypts your entire system drive, be aware that this will likely take days or weeks using 3 pass method, depending on HDD size, Truecrypt also has the Guttman 35-pass overwrite method, which potentially could take MONTHS to complete :)<br /><br />I encrypted a 320GB HDD with a brand new windows partition as a test, that took roughly 6 hours with no overwriting enabled.

This day and age, every young person should know, from a required computer class, that everything you&#039;ve ever done on your hard drive is set in stone. The only way to delete what you&#039;ve done is, basically, the equivalent of scrapping your comp. You have to destroy the hard drive through a hard drive shredder, which is very expensive. Formatting is bullshit, certainly not for the thorough type (the type who doesn&#039;t get busted, mind you). <br /><br />However, unless you&#039;re selling, I see no reason for you to worry. No one cares you use or used tor, unless they can link it to a felony, which they can&#039;t.

				Sorry stexo that was my fault I was actually thinking of degaussers, which are also an option (the expensive one). Shredders can in fact be pretty cheap and are recommended for anyone who owns a computer they don&#039;t want anyone looking through.<br /><br />And I would never trust any sort of formatting program, since there is no way for me to verify they work.

				Of course not, data is stored everywhere. For wiping your HDD, I suggest using dban, it has a few different options for what kind of erasing you need to do, and is extremely simple to use.

				Why does he need to destroy his WHOLE HD?&nbsp; That itself seems overkill.<br /><br />Is the OP using Windows? In that case I am not sure where all the temps and reocovery shit go.&nbsp; In that case, I&#039;d just DBAN it.&nbsp; <br /><br />In nix, you can use the srm tool, which comes with a 38-pass guntmann on it.&nbsp; You can delete your history/logs/files more securely as it doesn&#039;t &quot;hide&quot; them from you as much.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;ve hibernated with TOR on, then that partition needs to be wiped. I&#039;ll say this for those who have hidden partitions or folders where TOR is located: NEVER HIBERNATE or LET YOUR COMP SLEEP with tor on.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Why are you so afraid of TOR?&nbsp; If you&#039;ve used it without a VPN, you might as well just ignore this guntman etc shit as your ISP knows you&#039;ve used it.&nbsp; At which point it&#039;s total disappearance looks suspicious. TOR itself is legal and legit.&nbsp; If you&#039;re worried about it, encrypt the TOR bundle you use to do illegal shit, and make public one in which you use for legal/trolling.&nbsp; Make sure you delete TOR logs, however.
