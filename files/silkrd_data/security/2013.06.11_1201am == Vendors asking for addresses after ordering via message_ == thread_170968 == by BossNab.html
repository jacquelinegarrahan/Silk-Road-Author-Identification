				This has happened to me a few times so far...So I had to ask. Why are vendors asking for my shipping address via message? They usually lay on some excuse saying that their computer crashed or printer or something like that. <br /><br />I have a reputable vendor who is asking me for my address without pgp right now because he cannot access his &quot;crashed&quot; computer and pgp key.<br /><br />Is this a common thing?

				Common or not, never send any personal information without encryption. PGP is a required utility for being a vendor, it&#039;s up to them to get it working.

				Once against demonstrating that a PGP key is more about identity than privacy in anon communities.<br /><br />If a vendor &quot;loses&quot; his key, most people become suspicious that he&#039;s compromised. Make three backups of your key!<br />

				Find a vendor who uses PGP.<br /><br />It takes very little time/effort to create a new key pair. If they don&#039;t care about your security enough to use PGP do you really want them shipping you drugs in the mail?

				I&#039;ve had to ask a couple of people after I&#039;ve confirmed the order.. Usually just because I forgot to copy a street name or number or something.<br /><br />It&#039;s FINE.. As long as you PGP it, the vendors the only one who can see it.
