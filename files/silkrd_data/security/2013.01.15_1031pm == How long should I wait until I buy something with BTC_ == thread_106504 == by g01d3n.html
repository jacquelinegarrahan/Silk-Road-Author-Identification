				Hello, I just received some BTC today and I was wondering If I could just transfer them to my SR wallet immediately, or should I wait a few hours/days. Thank you very much for your help.

				The transactions are in the block chain forever. Doesn&#039;t matter if you wait 30 years, if you do a direct transfer then your SR address is linked to your buying address.

				You do not have to wait... Since you posted earlier, I suppose the coins would be sent from mtgox (or any account with your real info)?<br /><br />If so mix them, while I would say it is not a huge risk (most risk is receiving the package), mixing coins is pretty fast and easy with blockchain.info

				I see, so with my BTC, just quickly mix them then put them in my SR wallet. Thanks so much for everyone&#039;s help

				As someone&#039;s mentioned above, there is no reason why you should wait.<br />If you want to buy something, then just do it, don&#039;t hesitate, but please be sure to check out the seller&#039;s rating etc.

				I see, thank you Deutsche Bank.<br /><br />Off topic a bit, but I am pleasantly surprised by how helpful and insightful the member of SR are. I may not be able to thank everyone individually, but I really am thankful to everyone who has helped me the past few days get established on the Road.
