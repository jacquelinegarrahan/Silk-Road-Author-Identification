				Hey,<br />Is it fatal to send your Name &amp; Address to a vendor in plain text in the box in the shopping cart? Or is it safe but just safer to encrypt it? Thanks in advance :)<br />Regards

				Fatal? No. Risky? I think yes.<br /><br />If a vendor supplies their PGP key, best use it.

				It is completely unadvised. GPG is pretty easy to use, and virtually unbreakable. There is no reason NOT to use it.

				So we would have to send the seller a message of our encrypted address instead of entering it in the address field? or just put the whole encryption into the address field?

				Either use PGP (there are a number of guides on setting it up, but it is anything but user friendly), or privnote.com. Messages sent using privnote are destroyed once read, so even if the database is compromised, no data would be obtained.

				i feel ya void. <br />Could I not just use the sellers public key to encrypt it instead of giving them mine? seems like it would be more hassle for them to have to import my key instead of just using their&#039;s
