				I know that SR tumbles your coins, and I do buy with fake information, but i&#039;d like to beef up my own personal security just for peace of mind.&nbsp; Any suggested places to go that have worked well for you?&nbsp; I did a quick search, and nothing seems to be easy to find.

				I&#039;ll certainly try this for my next big transaction... seems like BI is beefing security and also sucking.&nbsp; Do they run dry or can you just order whenever? I&#039;ll probably do it first thing in the morning just to be sure.

				localbitcoins.com <br /><br />It&#039;s a clearnet escrow service for purchasing bitcoins, or you can do it in person (no escrow required, obviously). I just buy them off my attorney on the weekends, he just sells them as a side hobby :)&nbsp; Usually about a 10% fee, but total protection. Besides, he bills it to me as legal consultation.<br /><br />I currently have a handful of bitcoins, I&#039;ll sell them to established SR members at a 20% above mtgox rate with escrow. One time transactions only, limit $500, and included in that is a tutorial/walkthrough of the process. BITCOINS TO THE PEOPLE!!&nbsp; <br /><br />send pm for inquiries

				Easy there bubba. So sell some bitcoins to yourself a few times, ha. <br /><br />And can we knock it off with the methylone sales already? I mean jesus. All you vendors selling these direct ship M1 orders with sloppy hand written labels and haphazard packaging is what&#039;s going to get newer buyers busted and sources shut down permanently. Do us all a favor and quit littering the streets with that garbage.
