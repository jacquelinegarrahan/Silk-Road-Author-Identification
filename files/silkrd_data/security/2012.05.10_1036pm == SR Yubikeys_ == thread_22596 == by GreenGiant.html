				A virtual keyboard is not a &quot;hack proof&quot; way of keeping your keystrokes hidden.<br /><br />The real benefit of using a token is that it&#039;s &#039;two factor authentication&#039;<br /><br />in other words, something you know (your pin) and something you have (token)<br />search wikipedia.org for &quot;security token&quot;<br /><br />They are impervious to a keylogger attack vector as ever 30-60 seconds the token regenerates a new sequence of numbers (the same sequence is also being generated by the software on the authentication server)<br />It gets haairy though... Some improperly configured auth servers might allow the same token code to be used twice (man in the middle)<br />And if you are able to somehow compromise the unique seed files that the auth server uses to generate the new strings(see: like when RSA got owned)... game over.

				Personally i run SR on an encrypted windows 7 virtual machine hosted on a ubuntu encrypted LVM. Windows is encrypted with truecrypt, basically you have to type 4 strong password to be able to access the windows VM. If you steal my laptop, i say good chance to you to find anything useful because i do a secure erase of the HDD before installing the encrypted ubuntu system. Oh yeah, the \home folder is encrypted too ;) it&#039;s my everyday job to secure computers and i highly recommend Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser 2.2 for newbies that want to scan their windows system for security, this is a &quot;basic&quot; tool but if you want insane security microsoft have a pdf called: Threats and Countermeasures Guide: Security Settings in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (387 pages of tips on how to secure systems).

After that window is closed it&#039;s useless, a replay attack is impossible. It is also highly non-trivial in most cases to impersonate or piggyback onto somebody else&#039;s session. Again, man in the middle attacks are still possible, just not very likely.<br /><br />Note: keyloggers cover a wide variety of technologies with different levels of sophistication, they don&#039;t just collect keystrokes, they can also take screenshots, analyze your copy/paste clipboard, use OCR to sniff out characters etc. <br /><br />--<br /><br />I know people are worried about the concept of having a Yubikey hanging around the place. Seems like solid evidence that you&#039;re a SR user. However, this doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be the case, it depends on the implementation. It could be done properly without diminishing any anonymity. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s possible to order generic aids to generate one time passwords on the clearweb. Then you might just need to sync them. I&#039;m not 100% certain how it works in practice, but yes it&#039;s very possible, there&#039;s any number of ways to do it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks GreenGiant,<br /><br />Yes sad to say here in the UK we&#039;re at the mercy of RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) which was brought in around 12 years ago and requires that a person provide a &quot;key&quot; on request to make encrypted data legible or face conviction and imprisonment of up to two years.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this has already been touched on but a key in this sense could be a password, or keyfile on a disk. Some people have even tried to circumvent the problem by having a third party encode their data but obviously RIPA would apply to them too.<br /><br />As the article rightly states this may be preferable to revealing what is on the computer but the problem can easily be circumvented as GreenGiant rightly says through use of plausible denaibility in encryption - this is very easy to implement with a Truecrypt container. <br /><br />To my knowledge the legislation has only been invoked twice, where a suspect has actually been convicted. In terms of the Human Rights Act I do think they&#039;re on fairly dodgy ground as it erodes the right to silence but don&#039;t imagine your case will get as far as the ECHR if you&#039;re in this situation!<br /><br />They Yubikey is a great tool for providing an additional layer of security but obviously should be used in combination with a strong password/keyfiles.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22596.msg234968#msg234968">Quote from: GreenGiant on May 11, 2012, 10:11 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22596.msg234475#msg234475">Quote from: Limetless on May 11, 2012, 02:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22596.msg234467#msg234467">Quote from: GreenGiant on May 11, 2012, 01:54 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just keep everything on a hidden truecrypt partition on a USB.

Pretty sure you can be charged as a terrorist instead, In this boys situation i know which charge i would rather have.<br /><br />If the police came knocking at my door i would rather stick with my hidden partition, which i can reveal the password for the None hidden partition avoiding a unnecessary charge for not disclosing my yubikey password.<br /><br />edit: I know hidden partition does nothing to protect against keyloggers, but i would rather take my chances with the hackers than being found with physical evidence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

They might be useful as a blind i.e if you live in a country like the UK you could use them to encrypt some dummy data, let LE find the key and clap themselves on the back as they crack open your porn collection/personal bank account details.<br /><br />V.
