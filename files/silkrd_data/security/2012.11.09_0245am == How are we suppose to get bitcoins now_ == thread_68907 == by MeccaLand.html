				Don&#039;t know how popular this is in UK but localbitcoins.com has worked great for me.<br />In any case, giving localbitcoins.com exposure increases your chances of making it work for you.<br />Good luck

				They will be back up soon. They were making way too much money just to stop.Probably just to same old technical difficulties or the government is fucking around with them. Bitinstant should probably move to the Tor network. <br /><br />An expensive alternative is going on to memorydealers.com and order some&nbsp; casascius bitcoin. they&#039;re s cost 3 or 4 dollars more per coin than mt gox prices but you get a lil better deal if you buy more and u can pay for em them with a credit card. So, technically u can get some bitcoins on the front.!&nbsp; Theres nothing better than bitcoins on the front. <br /><br />UPDATE: THEY JUST ALL SOLD OUT!<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m starting to get worried as well. Bank deposits were my only way of funding my account. While I&#039;m sure whatever is up is no fault of their own, it&#039;s EXTREMELY fucking annoying how cryptic they are being about the whole thing. It would take all of 3 minutes to inform us of what is going on, and I think we, as their customers, deserve to know.

				I&#039;m going to post this, since it may be of use to someone or other.<br /><br />I have used the moneygram method of payment to deposit money directly into a bitcoin wallet on bitinstant. I just filled out their form or whatever, said I&#039;d deposit money at walmart and put in my btc address. I used all my real info for the moneygram, too. Didn&#039;t ask for ID or anything so it was fine.<br /><br />THIS WAS, however, about a month or two ago so I do not know if it is still a current method of getting bitcoins. All I wonder is if there&#039;s any reason it would no longer work.

				This shit changes--and gets more complicated--daily...which, of course, is why many of periodically give up, and go thru Sugar Mama, btc King or some other reputable online vendor...and pay the price.&nbsp; In last several months, bitinstant has become almost mandatory, mostly because of shenanigans pulled by some ripoffs from Dwolla, and other &#039;reversible&#039; money exchanges...and almost immediately, bitinstant itself became more and more of a pain...and most of us have spent to much time on bitcointalk.org ...which is often where you can find out what is happening, as most exchanges have reps on there...<br /><br />Right now, I&#039;m not really in the mood to play with all the OKPay shit, and Dwolla, well, it&#039;s slow, to me,getting shit done...so I personally think best shot is: https://www.bitcopia.com/&nbsp; Simple, yeah, you got to go deposit to bank, but hell, it&#039;s no safer doing anything else...and so far, nobody&#039;s getting beat down for buying btc....<br /><br />So yeah, first choice, bitcopia: simple, you can figure it out... second choice, either moneypak and SugarMama or Bank and btcKing ... when they&#039;re operating...they too, have been kind of &#039;down&#039; lately....
