				hey guys, I am trying to fund my SR account using bitfloor but i am having a little problem. I&#039;ve used bitfloor once before with no issue. However, today I went to my local Bank of america, filled out the deposit slip and gave the lady my money (400 dollars). About an hour later, the money showed up on my bitfloor, so no problems there. For some reason though, I cant get bitfloor to buy the bitcoins for me. I go to the &quot;trade&quot; tab, and put in 400 in the &quot;purchase the following USD amount of BTC&quot; spot, and hit the &quot;buy&quot; button, but nothing happens. Usually something will show up in the &quot;orders&quot; section at the bottom of the page while bitfloor waits to find the bitcoins but not this time. I&#039;ve put in various different amounts and still nothing is happening. Am I doing something wrong? Im starting to get worried

				Two days ago I had a very similar problem. At first, most of my order had gone through, but I had a nontrivial amount of USD leftover but now couldn&#039;t make any new pending orders appear. I closed my browser and retried, same problem, kept trying for a while, starting to get worried like you. Now here&#039;s the real scary point, at one point after hitting refresh, my trading page came back showing $0/0BTC available, as if my account had been emptied! I thought this was the truth for a few minutes, I was thinking about how best to contact Bitfloor about this while remaining anonymous... then on another reload, suddenly everything loaded correctly, my funds were intact, the trade went through... I exhaled deeply and then made my withdrawal as quickly as I fucking could.<br /><br />You are right to feel nervous, but hopefully my story makes you feel a little better. Keep trying, and please let us know how it turns out. This was a very stressful 1.5 hours for me, I would rather pay a slightly higher fee to another exchanger than go through that experience again.

				I also have a very small amount of BTC in my bitfloor account. Maybe that has something to do with it

				hey I figured out what was wrong! Idk if it was the same problem that you had. All I had to do was use a different web browser to get it to work. I was using internet explorer, but when i switched to firefox the whole thing went through easily

				Yes, at the time I suspected it might be browser issues... the browser I use is flaky at times to begin with. :)<br />Glad it worked out for both of us
