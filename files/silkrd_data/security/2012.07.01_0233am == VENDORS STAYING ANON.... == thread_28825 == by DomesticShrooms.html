				So what do you think about staying anon as a vendor?<br /><br />I think using your own connection could be suicide. As I see it there are a few options.<br /><br />1. Use a yagi and hack someones internet(only this brings heat on your neighbors)<br /><br />2. Go to coffeeshop everytime you message(p.i.t.a)<br /><br />3. Buy a prepaid android and card with cash and install pdanet or run orbot and orweb(keep gps turned off and never use it for anything other than vending)<br /><br />4. Buy a prepaid dongle with cash and never use it for clearnet or anything other than vending)<br /><br /><br />If you live in a apartment, would they be able to get you with triangulation? I mean, a cdma cash dongle seems ideal for mobility and annonaminity.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as encryption and stuff goes, that seems reactionary. My goal would be to never get identified in the first place. <br /><br /><br />I think that not keeping data around is key, only run liberte live and keep bookmarks and public keys on your usb.<br /><br />What do you think options 1 2 3 or 4?

				Option 5<br /><br />The best setup would be a bootable flash drive encrypted with truecrypt. The drive would have a dummy OS (ubuntu) and the actual one you would use to hold all the info on and connect through (some form of BSD).<br /><br />http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-operating-system<br /><br />By using the above tutorial you could give LEO a password to gain access to the drive but it would be the dummy OS that they can boot to. NEVER give them the password for BSD... they will never find it.<br /><br />Your ISP will be able to detect you using tor.<br /><br />In order to hide that from your ISP you need to rent a VPS anonymously.<br />https://btclot.com/web/cp.php?op=vps&amp;type=linux (just to through one out there.)<br />Once you have secured a VPS next you need to set up a TOR and socks proxy.<br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en<br />http://lifehacker.com/237227/geek-to-live--encrypt-your-web-browsing-session-with-an-ssh-socks-proxy<br /><br />After that you need to set a redirect the incoming traffic to the TOR port.<br />http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-port-redirection-with-iptables/<br /><br />Here is a discussion about how to jack up the encryption on the SSH proxy<br />http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/openssh/dev/45097<br /><br />anonaddict

				So back to to my original post, how in the fuck would you ever figure out where I am located or who I am if I am running a cash cdma dongle? I think it is way safer than using your own connection. And who the fuck would want to go to starbucks to sell drugs?<br /><br />And by the way, no one has identified me you ass.<br /><br /><br />I mean , as long as you never use the dongle on clearnet or use it for facebook, Im pretty sure you will be set. <br /><br />Fact: several vendors use their own connections without vpns or bridges!<br />

				So let me ask this then, if a anonomous cash dongle is better, then I guess I would not be a low hanging fruit? <br /><br />Are you inferring they may deploy triangulation on a gsm or cdma connection?<br /><br />I think it is way better than using your neighbors wifi.<br /><br />Fuck, I mean i have dropped a lot of cash on a anon dongle, sealer, account, labeler, packaging, ect. But at least I feel safe right?<br /><br />I just run liberte off a usb on a craptop computer and tether a cashdroid that has never had any other use than vending.<br /><br />I like to think this isolation keeps me from being a &quot;easy&quot; target.&nbsp; <br /><br />as long as I keep my lips shut&nbsp; and use good judgement I think low swinging westernunion idiots will take the heat, <br /><br />Have you heard of a silkroader getting triangulated because his isp was leaked and they cellular provider gave up the anon. persons general location??<br /><br />I feel my security is good, but now im gonna have to find a way to launder my funds......
