				Just do a moneypak to BTC trade on here. Yes it will cost you like 20% or more for that small a quantity but it will work. Just have to be very careful selecting a vendor; many people get scammed in that transaction.

				Try searching different cities and states it doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be your city. LocalBTC has escrow just message someone and ask if they could do a MP or netspend. 75% they&#039;ll do it but also there are sellers on there that have listings for that option too.. I just checked right now and there are sellers on there selling way below market price.

				I&#039;ve written LBC it a few times and even given step by step instructions. It&#039;s not too hard to figure out. Here&#039;s one of mine:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The thing that skeches me out most about LocalBitcoins is.... they&#039;ll somehow find a way to get my cash and fraud me on the actual BTC transaction.&nbsp; Like get my address wrong without me knowing or something.&quot;<br /><br />No way. Not if you use the LBC system the right way. You have the BTC seller fund the transaction right before the meetup. He does this by sending the bitcoins to an LBC holding wallet. That shows you he&#039;s not bullshit. Then after receiving your cash, he releases the bitcoins to your LBC wallet. If you list your cell number secretly on the site you&#039;ll get a text with a confirmation code only you will know confirming the release of your bitcoins. You can also login to your account and just check it to make sure it&#039;s been released. After that you can immediately transfer the BTC to your own wallet elsewhere. Escrow is only needed if a bank transfer is involved, since you&#039;re not meeting in person and have to trust someone else online whom you&#039;ve never met.

				It&#039;s pretty easy. There are certain things you should you look for to make your transaction easier. Most sellers on there are real cool and I could understand being nervous the first time..My first time I went heavy with a friend and ended up being a smooth quick transaction. <br /><br />First thing, find someone who has transactions done and has a good recent feed back. While your in the sellers profile check his/her&#039;s most recent sign on..IF it&#039;s pretty recent, put the amount you want to buy. On the bottom box write a message...I usually just chat em up a little bit to get a feel what the seller is like. Always meet in a public busy place, like mc donalds or starbucks something like that. IF you don&#039;t feel comfortable doing cash for coins in person ask the seller to open escrow. Once escrow is loaded up, there&#039;s a secret code they give you, it&#039;s word that only you know and the seller will also know this later on. Once you guys meet up, you could ask him what&#039;s the code then or later but I never used the code there was no need as every seller I dealt with always made it that they transfer the coins directly to my wallet and I hand over the cash. If it&#039;s a good professional seller and you&#039;ve told him that this is your first time using the service he&#039;ll make it comfortable for you and release escrow or transfer coins directly to your wallet from your cell phone before asking for the cash..From there well you can figure out the rest.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few more tips, LocalBTC all sellers they want to sell their coins and their always open to neog&#039;s for a cheaper price. You can always ask them to lock in the price also so that in case you meet them up and the price went up you&#039;ll just pay at the nego locked price agreed.&nbsp; I also always talk to them on the phone first before meeting them up, you can get a better feel on the sellers character. After you do a few transactions with your seller you can move onto MP&#039;s as there&#039;s a trust formed. I got 3 on my speed dial with different prices and minimums but all under market price.<br /><br />I found this way to be the cheapest and hassle free...Don&#039;t have to worry about funds not getting transferred , no fee&#039;s..And sellers really don&#039;t ask what you&#039;re going to use the coins for, they tend to mind their own business.<br /><br />If you&#039;re still lost, just find a seller and talk to him/her. Have them explain the process and figure out which one is works for you. Once you get it down you&#039;ll find it so much better then buying through bitinstant or other places that charge fee&#039;s from multi points. <br /><br />Good luck and I hope this helped.

That way you go through their system and can leave each other positive feedback. As soon as the funds are released you can see your updated balance right away. You can also transfer your coins out of your holding wallet into your real wallet right after that too. Just make sure you use the LBC system and leave feedback after each trade since every use makes it stronger.

				I have seen plenty of sellers on there have $25 minimums.&nbsp; If not, find a seller who has posted a phone number or e-mail in their profile who accept Vanilla Reloads or Moneypaks and ask them if they will accommodate you.&nbsp; Tell them its your first time and you just want to try it out.&nbsp; They might accommodate you to get future business.
