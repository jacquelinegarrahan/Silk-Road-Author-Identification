				This article is from a year ago, has anyone seen an update to this story?<br /><br />On the face of it, the proposal doesn&#039;t appear to have legs. There are worlds more to the concept of &quot;national security&quot; than the ability of law enforcement agencies to spy on subjects. Our entire data infrastructure requires strong encryption. A backdoor is nothing more than a blatant flaw in the system, which would be KNOWN, actively pursued, and quickly exploited.<br /><br />Plus, as I understand it, it&#039;s not even a capability given the way encryption works? I know flaws happen, but to build every encryption system with *the same* flaw doesn&#039;t seem possible. Anyone who has access to the source code (or EVERYONE in OSS) would have access to the back door key, either directly or indirectly. I&#039;m sure they would take steps to prevent such a leak, but it wouldn&#039;t last forever. <br /><br />And that&#039;s just if it&#039;s even doable. Could a system that encrypts using AES-256 just be updated to include a back-door key? It sounds more like the people who proposed it have watched too many spy movies. Fuck! Even beyond my personal desire for privacy (fuck that, my RIGHT to privacy) it sounds like any implementation would be an international disaster waiting to happen.

				This is the same old story that our government has been trying to implement for years. Encryption makes wiretapping difficult so they are trying to outlaw encryption. It&#039;s not possible to have true, secure encryption with backdoors. For many years our government classified encryption as a weapon and &quot;controlled&quot; its export. Open source and the internet have combined to make that whole effort irrelevant. <br /><br />It&#039;s not going to happen because it makes no sense. Law enforcement is going to have to deal with a world that has gone back to the past, when laws were written, where a person could whisper something and expect not to be overheard.<br />
