Sad to say I&#039;m based in the UK but perhaps you could post on here, see if any kind hearted soul in the US would be willing to send you some BTC in exchange for cash? I would offer to do it for you myself but when you consider shipping costs from there to here and the time involved, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d be able to get as good a rate as someone living in the good old US of A.<br /><br />V.

				http://www.bitlobby.com sells SolidCoins for credit card or Paypal. You can then take the SolidCoins you purchased via CC, and trade them on numerous exchanges for little to no fee and get bitcoins back.

				Using a card doesn&#039;t sound like the best idea unless it&#039;s one of those pre paid cards. Remain Anonymous.

				eBay also sell Bitcoins at highly inflated prices.<br /><br />Also take a look at your latest copy of Craigslist - you&#039;ll probably be able to find people willing to sell Physical Bitcoins. I&#039;d happily help you but live in England, not US.<br /><br />V.

				Use a credit card (pre-paid bought with cash preferably) at western union to transfer funds to https://www.canadianbitcoins.com/index.php<br /><br />I&#039;ve worked with this site multiple times and they are reliable.
