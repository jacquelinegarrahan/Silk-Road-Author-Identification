				So I&#039;ve spent the last few hours going through tutorials and reading as much as I can about installing Tails on my usb to run on my intel based mac. I have downloaded the newest version of Tails along with rEFIT. When I boot using rEFIT it is not recognizing my usb as a bootable drive and thus cannot run tails. I have looked everywhere and others have had the same problem as well. Does anyone here know how to successfully run tails on an intel based mac via usb? BTW my version of os x is 10.5.8. Thanks!
