				I may have made a mistake filling out the blue form by not writing the actual btc addres that the payment was supposed to go to, maybe I&#039;m just being paranoid lol. I&#039;m probably just overthinking it but I&#039;m right in my thinking that you don&#039;t include the btc address on the payment sheet for Bitinstant. Sorry for taking up room with this question but it may help out others curious in the future as well

				Check the address on blockchain to see if it&#039;s on its way... it&#039;ll need to reach at least 6 confirmations before showing up in your SR account.

				Unlike a lot of other users, I have never had a problem with BitInstant. If you have to fill out the MG form, the account number is the actual account number you are given on your order form. If you are doing a deposit to a bitcoin address, it can take up to 24 hours like they say (never been that long in my experience) - but, if you didn&#039;t use a bogus email, check for your confirmation. Zipzap and Bitinstant will send you confirmations when everything goes through and is processing. <br /><br />When I deposit directly to my personal wallet, it&#039;s literally within 60 minutes, but if you deposited directly to SR (not recommended) it can take longer. <br /><br />Do you have your order form or confirmation emails? Where did you send the deposit - personal wallet, email, SR?
