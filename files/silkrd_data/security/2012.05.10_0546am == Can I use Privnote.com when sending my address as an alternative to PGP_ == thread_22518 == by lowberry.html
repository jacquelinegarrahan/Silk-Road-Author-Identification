				Awesome link deadkndys420, this whole pgp thing has been wrecking my not so smart brain for the last few weeks. Thanks to all the forum members who have been so helpful with all this as I&#039;d still be struggling to make an order without your help. Peace &amp; Love

				You could trust your safety to privnote; I wouldn&#039;t but you could. It&#039;s more do you trust that they delete, and even if they do unless it&#039;s being over written many time the data is recoverable. Always handle your own encryption.<br /><br />~Digi

				I would personally use GPG for it as it&#039;s a little bit of a hassle but worth it for the peace of mind, nice site though, use it when I&#039;m not doing real dodgy business (like sending my adress to buy drugs) :)
