				Hey all,<br /><br />So, every time I work with pgp/gpg, I&#039;ve been in the habit of uninstalling/reinstalling it with a usb stick.<br /><br />I only install/uninstall gpg with my ethernet cord disconnected from the pc, and I only encrypt information with the ethernet cord disconnected.&nbsp; SO, my question:&nbsp; Is this a pointless step to take to help ensure my security, or should I keep it up?&nbsp; <br /><br />To be completely honest, I don&#039;t have extreme security measures in place for browsing SR and the forums. It would be possible for me to make a secure set up (I know how), but because I work from home, I like to browse the forums while I work.&nbsp; Never do I visit SR while I am working though.&nbsp; &nbsp;I use win 7, and I don&#039;t boot from usb drive to use tor.&nbsp; I also only order very small personal amounts of weed.&nbsp; So, in general&nbsp; my security kind of sucks so I was just curious as to whether or not it was a good idea to stay disconnected while using gpg/pgp?<br /><br />Started to ramble but thx for response!

				Seems pointless. Especially disconnecting the cable, gpg tools don&#039;t even need to use internet, except downloading from keyserver and wouldn&#039;t give away any identifying info. Anyway gpg is the least dangerous tool when you deal in SR. You already have tor installed and probably SR address bookmarked. Don&#039;t you think that&#039;s a bit more dangerous than a legal encryption tool?&nbsp; Just make sure your personal key isn&#039;t registered with your real name or clearnet email,if you use it in here.<br />I suggest you download truecrypt and do a full disk encryption it&#039;s a good option since you use the same PC for all your activities.

				You can leave the gpg on the usb-stick.<br /><br />You can leave the stick in the computer for ever.<br /><br />Use a other stick for tails, or use a dvd.<br /><br />You will be safe.<br /><br />For sure!

				Obtained how? GPG is not broadcasting what you write, and for LE to be monitoring you they would already have your address.<br />Only way that I can think of someone seeing your address while typing would be a keylogger but it&#039;s not what LE would use. And anyway that wouldn&#039;t make any difference if you were temporarily offline.
