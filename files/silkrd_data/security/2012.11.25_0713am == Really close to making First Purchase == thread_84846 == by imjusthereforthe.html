				Only thing holding me back is bitcoins. So I thought about using my bank account to use the money on it to buy bitcoins. How safe is this? Using a service like coinbase.com and I think Dwolla might be similar? Would it work if you send it from coinbase to blockchain and then to SR? Has anyone else used coinbase or know anything like it?

				That&#039;s more or less how I did it.&nbsp; I did it in two transactions, used blockchain mixer for both to a secondary wallet running over tor.<br /><br />You should know that the network knows what IP addresses propagated a transaction.&nbsp; This applies if you are sending bitcoins over your network.&nbsp; IMO you should always use tor with your wallet.

				Will coin base or blockchain care that i am connecting through tor? And does anyone else have experience or suggestions on what site to use for bank to bitcoin trade with little fees? Coinbase seems nice though, if anyone has any experiences for that.

Did you then send the coins straight from coinbase to SR? <br /><br />also it is worth noting im in the US and plan on not be spending over $1000 in one purchase here on SR.
