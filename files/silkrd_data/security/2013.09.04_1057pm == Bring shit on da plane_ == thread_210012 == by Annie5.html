				Damn..I wouldn&#039;t. I used to sketch so unbelievably hard on bringing like a&nbsp; .5 gram of weed when I was just a lad. I couldn&#039;t imagine having acid and a shit ton of xanax. The 1- strip blotter, you could probably hide in one of those cross word puzzle books people usually take on planes. Idk if it would work but you could put the strip deep in the book, and throw the book in your backpack.<br /><br />As for the xanax I have no clue. Maybe forge a script?

				nah, i would just have to find some old pill bottle with 2mg dosages, they wouldnt know the difference. <br />And silos acid is the strongest shit ive ever had dude, if your looking to fry your balls off at a good price , then go for it. i ended up throwing it away cause it jus fucked my brain soooo hard. lol

				From around 100+ experiences of smuggling 1g to 2KG on an airplane coupled with hundreds of other experiences from acquaintances, I would say, they never find jack shit. Certainly not the amounts and drugs you&#039;re talking about. Too small to stand out on an x-ray and not a risk for dogs.... But I don&#039;t want to be the one who told you to do it and you end up getting busted :)

				Personally, I would have only felt safe with the blotter on me.<br />If you are going to try flying again while packing a bunch of illegal shit, it may be a decent idea to not be totally fucked up when you are in the airport. At least wait til you get through screening before going off your rocker.

				The blotter is easy. Just wrap in in another small piece of paper, like a receipt, and stick it in your wallet. The X-rays will never be able to tell what it is. As for the Xanax, put them in a pill bottle like they give you at the drugstore. Forge a fake label and put your name on, to make it look like they&#039;re legitimately yours.<br /><br />And most importantly, play it cool.

				Was thinkin about this myself, I am going on holiday in a few months and was thinking of taking some blotters with me ;) .... but going from the EU through the US is making me think otherwise !!! I know the blotters are hard to spot, but the customs and security checks are to strict I think ...

				I&#039;ve done It a few times- cocaine and ecstasy.<br />&nbsp;Never had a problem but did get a big scare once...<br />Had a 7gs of coke in the lining of my jeans near my crotch area I had sewn up and had dog walk right by me while I was in line waiting to get through the security gate. Talk about feeling sick as fuck! I was in s pretty big line when I noticed the agent with the dog come strolling by and I had the urge to get out the line and walk in the opposite direction but I quickly decided that that would look suspicious so I stayed put. They walked right by me lol. ..I always assumed that that dog must have been trained specifically for explosives or something? Who&#039;s knows....

				well I tried Silos lsd and i FRIED MY FUCKING FACE OFF, kinda tooo much hfor me on one hit, the strongest shit i have ever had so i tossed the rest that morning after frying nuts!!<br /><br />so i got some shrroms from MushroomGirl, and if you guys are looking for some good natural high, then it feels wayy better and much more natural than the chemical induced acid feeling,, so i recomend&nbsp; some of that instead over Silos acid, any day.. <br /><br />Plus i only ate ,half an eight i, recieved 7 grams (10 shrooms total) cause i got her 1/4 oz deal for 45$ and im telling you, i only ate 3 shrooms and i was really fucking high i felt like a damned SLuG lol<br /><br /><br />also another thing if anyone is going for pinnaclegoods xanax i wouldnt do it, they are 2mg white &#039;footballs,, and they are deffinately not very strong, so i may just finish these these out and find a new guy for my plane ride,, <br /><br />is &#039;purple foootballs&#039; are strong as fuck tho, so i wish hed switch back to those or something, its a shame,, <br /><br />anyone know of someone with real usa certified xanax bars,, hmu if so, thanks guys for the info :)

				im from Aus so the xanax might be diff.. but we have the purple ones as well. the long white ones you can break into 4 pieces and the white football ones, which are the same as the purple, but white. The white football ones are just the generic, purple are the name brand, and not sure which the ones you can break into 4 are. <br /><br />All 3 seem the same when I have them. <br /><br />Unless you got some cheap indian ones, you sure didn&#039;t build up a tolerance ?

				K guys,I&#039;ll check you out, how are your reviews?<br />cause some people will leave good reviews, cause their afraid of getting blacklisted, like on pinnacle goods he has a thing where if you leave any&nbsp; contructive cridicism you wll be blacklisted, so thats a shame took them after finalizing my order,<br /><br />so yeahh if you have that kinda game im not interested,<br /><br />plus im not looking for any foreign shit, or hand made pills; cause most of it is not strong, at all.<br />Deffinately want usa sourced shit, straight from the lab! lol

				Wait, why are you worried about 60 xanax? Just put it in a Tylenol or some other pill bottle. You REALLY think they are going to open it and wonder what they are? You guys need to stay off of drugs for like one day lol
