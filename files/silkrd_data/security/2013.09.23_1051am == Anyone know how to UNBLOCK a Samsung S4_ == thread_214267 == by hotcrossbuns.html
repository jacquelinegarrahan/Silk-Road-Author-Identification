				Sorry, I wasn&#039;t sure what section I should put this in..<br /><br />Basically 02 in the UK made a mistake on my contract and sent me the same phone twice.<br />So I told them I put one back in mail to them and it must have gone missing, this was about 3 months <br />ago and they haven&#039;t bothered me since. But now I have a phone as useful as an inflatable anchor..<br /><br />I know it is possible to change the IMEI number, but do I need another phone of the same make and model<br />to take the IMEI number from?<br /><br />Any advice on what to do with the phone would be great, im tempted to just post it to a random house in Cuba, <br />maybe they wont subscribe to the blocking service and someone will get some use out of it... <br /><br /><br />

				Have you tested the phone on any other networks?&nbsp; The vast majority of the time when IMEIs get blacklisted, it is only by one provider.&nbsp; S4 is trivial to unlock for free, and then you could sell it as an unlocked phone.<br /><br />Alternatively, if you can figure out how to re-write the IMEI, you can just re-write a random number and it&#039;ll work fine.&nbsp; In fact, you can just &quot;corrupt&quot; the right part of the NVRam, and the phone will default to the generic IMEI 135790246811220.&nbsp; On some providers, emergency numbers won&#039;t work with a corrupt IMEI, but on the vast majority of providers the phone will work flawlessly.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably have to dig on how to do either tho, these are tricks to a closely kept trade.<br /><br />

I have given up on unblocking mine. Hopefully it will be able to make a phone call soon.

				Sounds like they might be some hope...Will try the easy unlock first.. <br /><br />Will keep digging, I would not know were to start with changing the IMEI number, I have done a bit of research<br />found some compturering software, but not instructions on how to use it, gets very complicated..<br /><br />Would love to find a pay for service but know it would be a real challenge to find one that I could trust..

Seriously, just stop. All you do is spread misinformation based on what your &quot;friends&quot; tell you is true. How about sticking to topics you are actually knowledgeable about? I&#039;m not trying to be a dick and I&#039;m dead serious. I&#039;m getting tired of complete morons spreading bullshit all over this forum. I don&#039;t mean to imply that these things aren&#039;t possible. I am only saying that if you hear things from a friend, yet you know absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, then maybe you should just shut your fucking mouth. Thanks.
