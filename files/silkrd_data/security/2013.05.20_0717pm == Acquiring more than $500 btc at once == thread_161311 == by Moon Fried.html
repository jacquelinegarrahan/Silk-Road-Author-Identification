				What&#039;s the fastest and most convinient way? I usually go to CVS and use MoneyGram through BitInstant but there&#039;s a maximum of $500.

				**Now this is just based upon actual events which happened to me**<br /><br />The couple times which i have had to speak to a MG Representative....i didnt wait a few (maybe 5) minutes<br />to complete my second BI transaction within the CVS/Wal-Mart.<br /><br />When i do it the way i have just explained....it works flawlessly for me..like i said..from reading past threads about BI ..what i do may not work for others&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Just Sayin&nbsp; :P<br /><br />i truely hope that everything works for you&nbsp; (Hugs)&nbsp; <br /><br />:)<br /><br />Once again...my way of doing things may not work for others.<br /><br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				Okay... well it&#039;s definitely worth a try. What I&#039;ll do is pay for the first transaction, wait for Blockchain to say there&#039;s btc on the way, then go for my second transaction. Seems pretty legit. 8)<br /><br />Thanks ChemCat.

				It WILL be picked up as a duplicate. Once I did a $1000 (split into $500), and once I payed through zipzap, one only came through. a rep told me that large amount in split orders have to be two different unique amounts. took 48hr for the coins. Thats when the big bubble popped so I was potentially fucked.

				Fellas, probably the most anonymous and easiest way to get bitcoins is by going on localbitcoins.com
