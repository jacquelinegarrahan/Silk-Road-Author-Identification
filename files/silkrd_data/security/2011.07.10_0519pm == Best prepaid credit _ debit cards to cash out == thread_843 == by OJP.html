				hey,<br /><br />there are al ot prepaid credit card suppliers all over the world. <br /><br />i am looking for the one with the cheapest rates to cash out money world wide on ATMs and maybe for the securest offshore one, although i think that if you cash out on an ATM without a surveillance camera and a hat and sunglasses there is no additional need of a &quot;more&quot; secure supplier.<br /><br />What are your favorites? Ideas?

				i did a bit research and this is what i have found out:<br /><br />cheap refillable CC or Debit Cards are always scam if they dont want an ID or passport and gas bill e.g.<br /><br />the only legit-looking ID-free refillable CC or Debit cards are from offshore banks who provide a nominee service. this costs several 100$s. <br /><br />the most secure offshore offers were about 1000$ incl shipping, nominee etc.hey also have high fees. but the limits are mostly at over 50.000$ a year.., so mostly attractive for people with several thousands of income every month.<br /><br />in the EU you will have to get the Card by Mail or you can buy a prepaid card which will need to be registered by phone but those cards often get closed without a reason, they also have very low limits.<br /><br />so if you want a good and reliable CC / DC you will need to get a dead drop anyway.<br /><br />the question is: you want to spend 1000$ or more on a high fee high limit offshore credit card<br />or:<br />ILLEGAL PART:<br />you get a cheaper online prepaid CC like payoneer, atmcash etc and get someone to make a fake passport scan and gas or electricity bill . send them in and hope they accept them. and i have heard of cases in which good online ID fake generators worked..<br />if you search on talkgold.com you can find companies which just follow the money laundering etc law which says they need a valid passport etc for identification of the CC, but they dont actually give a shit about how genuine the identification is, because the cards are prepaid only and they cant loose any money.<br /><br /><br />this is just my noobish point of view on the topic. maybe im wrong but hopefully someone with more experience in the topic might help us out a bit
