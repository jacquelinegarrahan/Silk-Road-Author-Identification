				Ok, so I completely understand the desire to distance oneself as much as possible from one&#039;s use of SR. But here is my question:<br />As we all know, it is best to deny any knowledge of ordering drugs if the police come knocking on the door saying that they have seized a shipment addressed to you. Plausible deniability is the way to go, as the police have to prove &quot;beyond any reasonable doubt&quot; that you did in fact order said package. Say you do this, and the police return with a search warrant and they search your computer. In my case at least, they would find the Tor Browser Bundle, but apart from that just normal legal stuff. Presuming that nothing related to SR is saved on the computer, no passwords or usernames, and no tormail addresses, only PGP encryption software; I fail to see how a single shipment of drugs and a copy of the Tor browser is sufficient evidence to &quot;prove beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that one did in fact order drugs over SR. <br /><br />I&#039;m not suggesting that everyone stop using their Live USBs and what not, but if I&#039;m missing something here then please could someone fill me in?<br />- JH

				Eh, slow down there...<br /><br />Assuming you are in the US.....<br />If police search your computer and find what I like to call &quot;SR paraphernalia&quot; they may or may not realize its significance.&nbsp; If they do, you can expect them to get motivated to continue their search.&nbsp; That could, in your case, include subpoenaing you to provide the password to your accounts online (as such a precedent has been set that you must do so or face possible arrest and contempt of court charges).<br /><br />I recommend keeping a clean, unencrypted, computer when receiving packages.&nbsp; Not to mention a clean house with ZERO paraphernalia, scales, expensive lighters, etc. will go a long way.<br /><br />Good luck and send me postcards from prison, :)<br />lelmeriodici

				Great, thanks for the feedback :)<br />So possession of Tor can&#039;t be used as proof that one ordered off SR, but it might be brought up as circumstantial evidence. I guess if that were to happen you could argue that you have Tor as a security measure when connecting to public wifi, and PGP to encrypt pornography so that a significant other or someone wouldn&#039;t find it. <br />I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m going to sell this computer and buy a new one anyway, so I&#039;ll just run permanently off a LiveUSB.<br />- JH

				Yes but the tor browser is not illegal and cannot lead to SR by itself!&nbsp; I agree about stupid people, its a sad reality but they are everywhere.&nbsp; If you are smart you can find a good public defender, all lawyers have to do pro bono work, simply go to the court and find out when a good lawyer is working as a public defender!

				Ok great, so do you guys think it&#039;s possible for an intelligent person to reasonably defend themselves in court, with the evidence against them being a small amount of drugs shipped to them, a copy of Tor Browser Bundle and PGP Encryption software on their computer? I think it could be, but I&#039;m not a lawyer. <br /><br />I figured the argument for having Tor on the computer could be that one is interested in government conspiracies and that it was used to browse deepweb sites such as Parazite (http://kpynyvym6xqi7wz2.onion), The Tor Library (http://am4wuhz3zifexz5u.onion), or The Hidden Wiki (http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). I guess it could also be argued that PGP software was used to encrypt sexually explicit messages sent between the computer&#039;s owner and their previous significant other&#039;s work email address, to avoid her boss detecting anything. <br /><br />I should probably say that I currently have no need to defend myself in court, but I do get paranoid and like to have an escape / excuse route in my head ready to go ;)<br />- JH<br />

				Circumstantial evidence *is* important. If real investigations are anything like those on TV&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Circumstantial evidence is everywhere, and hence is much easier to find. And can lead to further evidence gathering. If Tor is found on your computer, is could lead to a scan of your hard drive which potentially would never have otherwise happened. This could show evidence of Silkroad usage (I think that is possible even using Tor browser, could be wrong). Or they could look and find something in your house after a search.<br /><br />I personally would prefer avoid getting arrested, rather then being guilty, arrested, and hoping they don&#039;t have a strong enough case for a conviction. And if you take care of these circumstantial, superficial things, then it means you might not have to keep your computer and house forensically clean.<br /><br />That&#039;s not to say Tor and GPG would be enough by itself to lead to further investigation. This would presumably depend on how busy, or alternatively, determined they are. You could keep Tor and GPG on a secret USB drive or something.
