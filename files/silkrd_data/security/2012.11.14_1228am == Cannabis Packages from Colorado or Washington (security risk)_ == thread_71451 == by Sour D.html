				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is it reasonable to worry that cannabis packages (under an oz.) from SR that are coming from Colorado or Washington will be subject to increased scrutiny? Are postal inspectors going to pay more attention to packages coming out of those states? What about postal inspectors or mailmen in the destination state?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my experience, regardless of state, it seems even cannabis packages purchased from extremely high-rated vendors (close to 100%) aren&#039;t completely discreet. Even when the package itself on the outside looks professional and not suspicious, there is always a SOFT BULDGE that if squeezed is fairly obvious that it&#039;s weed. With the recent legalization, is there good reason to be worried about receiving packages from these states?

				They already flag colorado and washington as drug exporting areas, same with california and florida according to all the leaked USPS inspector and customs info over the years. I don&#039;t see them doing any additional scrutiny because they have no money to increase inspections and they&#039;re already scrutinizing these states :)

				My favorite cannabis vendor seems to ship from Washington and I haven&#039;t had an issue yet so I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be an issue. And yeah, weed is legal in Washington and Colorado now(some other states have it legalized for medical reasons too, so they might also be given more scrutiny)

				Its actually not legal in colorado or washington yet. Neither Governor has signed the passage into abill yet, usually it takes around 30 days but technically they dont have to until the 1st of the new year. As soon as either state does in fact pass into legalization marijuana you better believe the feds will step up enforcement as far as the USPS goes. that is the one thing they can control with relatively lower costs then putting DEA all over the two states. CO has a year from the 1st of Jan to implement its Retail part of the bill.. i wouldnt keep my hopes up for that one.

These states include Washington, Oregon, California (obviously), and Colorado. I believe these are the states that produce and export the highest amount of pot to the rest of the country. I moved from the West US to the Midwest over a year ago, and have noticed the HUGE and rapidly rising number of people getting cannabis shipped to them from their Western buddies (including myself). People are quickly figuring out that the $1000-$2000 lb they can get from the Western (assuming they have average hook-ups, I&#039;m well aware the prices can be a lot lower than that depending on the bulk of the purchase) can sell for 3500-4500. The shipping game is blowing up, and although the chance of someone being able to get a couple hundred lbs shipped to them a week to supply a whole city for a long period of time without getting busted is low, a lot of people in the same city receiving a few lbs a week can satisfy a lot of demand if the sellers know what they are doing...<br /><br /><br />just a thought

				Its my opinion that when legalization is finally enacted the Feds are gonna crack a few exporters hard to send a message to discourage others. So for the first little bit, I think so.<br /><br />Just my opinion, not facts.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right, it makes sense that the feds would target exporters in those states to send a message. But will they pay any attention to the receivers? I&#039;ll bet if they crack down on exporters of cannabis, they are going to at least write down the names of the receivers. What they will do with this I don&#039;t know. Maybe I&#039;m paranoid but I fear that my name will be recorded into a fed database and possibly be used against me in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve already tried a fake name that worked for a while, but eventually a package was labeled &quot;addressee unknown&quot; and sent back so I figured that would be suspicious if I continued that.

				It&#039;ll take at least a year for the states to sort our their internal regulations, and then the feds will most likely sue.&nbsp; Even if the feds lose (and constitutionally, federal law takes precedent) I think it&#039;s likely that they&#039;ll tie it up in court for a very long time.&nbsp; It remains to be seen of course, but I wouldn&#039;t count on seeing retail marijuana in either Colorado or Washington in the near future.<br /><br />In Washington, retail sales, if they ever do get sorted, will be limited to 1 oz, so medical use, which is already legal, will continue to be a much greater export risk from an LE perspective because patients can buy 1.5 legally.<br /><br />Z

				lol?? have you forgot about what california has been doing for YEARSSSSS on end. and that is not even enough for LE to waste there time with even a LB is a complete waste of their time to even try to track the person having sent it or the person recieveing, All you need to worry about is that the person sending it packages it professionally and safely. Im not quite sure that many people know this but when flying from cali you are allowed to fly with a certain amount of herb. The amount i will not say but it is not in limited to an oz i can tell you that. Of course you must be a ca resident with a permit but honestly most the time tsa doesnt even bother.<br /><br />Most the time if a package is lost its because it was actually lost or the person having sent it is an idiot and or being watched already.<br /><br />Keeping a steady flow of packages is always your best bet, Do all your shopping online, Everything, the more of a routine it becomes for the post office the better.<br /><br />Shit, when sending under an oz the cost of gas involved to intercept that package isnt even worth it lmao WORRY WART!!!!!!!
