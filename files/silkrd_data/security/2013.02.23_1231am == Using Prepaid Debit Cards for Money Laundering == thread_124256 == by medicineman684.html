				I&#039;m looking to get moneypak numbers from (off SR) clients, load into prepaid debit cards and then withdraw via cash-back at stores.&nbsp; Does anyone have recommendations? Ideally I&#039;d like to get some cards that require no ID. I suppose I could buy a fake ID&nbsp; but not sure what else they ask for verification? Does anyone know of any that do not require an ID? Any ones that you recommend or avoid?<br /><br />thanks!<br />-mm

				Prepaid debit cards require valid id and SS#. The only anonymous sort of card you can get are those sketchy polish ones that always get flagged cause some other douchebag on the same account uses them for fraud. You can exchange your btc for cash or gold through exchangers.

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I totally agree about cashing in through gold with btc. However I would like to be able to offer the option of letting people pay me with moneypaks. Guess I&#039;m wondering how to cash these in. One route would be to get a fake ID if all they are asking for is a scan. Of course I wouldn&#039;t have a matching social so not sure if that would get flagged.&nbsp; Do they ask for anything else but a scanned id?<br /><br />-mm

				Having money in a prepaid card has nothing to do with laundering money, laundering money is when you make the money look like it&#039;s coming from a legit source. <br /><br />Having the money in an account has zero to do with laundering&nbsp; :)

				Masterblaster, you don&#039;t know what are you talking about? Card can be flagged if suspicious activity has been done. It&#039;s normal that bank will blocked a card if you load money do withdrawal, load money do withdrawal and again again again. Because it&#039;s so stupid activity and they know that you wash some money or want to cash out it anonymously but we all know&nbsp; that prepaid cards has not been designed to cash out money, it&#039;s additional function of this cards and main function is to do payments online/instore. I have never heard that this polish cards you&#039;re talking about are flagged.<br />

				So much conflicting advise on this sort of topic. I am curious about this way of getting BTC into dollars annonomysly. I think calling it &quot;money laundering&quot; in the title is a little inflamitory. The idea of a credit card tapping an offshore account sounds good. I&#039;d guess governments would find a way to monitor such transfers into their countries. So, seems sketchy to me.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like a pm with the less publishable details if possible ;-)

All i know is i researched this and the only people offering &quot;anonymous&quot; accounts are people who either stole paypal accounts, or polish citizens who open a bank account and give out debit cards which then cause the entire account to be blocked cause someone used a card to defraud someone else. You *can* get virtual credit cards, and maybe find some without having to give personal info, but they dont work on most sites cause theres no physical address tied to them. Everything else requires a SSN, sorry, federal law, no business is going to skirt that for you. <br /><br />You can either cash out with money or metal through certain exchangers, ive never used them personally but its better than cashing out into your bank account.&nbsp;

				So, I got one of those Green Dot prepaid Visas today to do a test run to see if I could use it as a VCC-type setup.&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; And, while you could use this to launder money, you couldn&#039;t launder much, and anything that goes through it might be subject to overwatch.&nbsp; Basically, you buy the card in a store, but to activate it, you get asked a million questions ranging from simple things like SSN and DOB (easily purchased) to family information and previous addresses.&nbsp; Then, after all of that, you are told that a new card with your name on it will be mailed to you.&nbsp; You don&#039;t get to tell it where to mail the card; it already &quot;knows.&quot; <br /><br />So, you can load these card with lots of cash (they even have incentives for loading it with more than 1k), but everything is tied, and tied tightly, to you.&nbsp; You would basically have to target someone, get his complete history, and then intercept his mail IOT use this for money laundering, and even then, there&#039;s no reason to think they can&#039;t freeze the funds.<br /><br />I have 5 VCCs on the way from Poland (I know they&#039;ve been blasted in this forum for being unreliable), and I&#039;ll let you know how they go.&nbsp; Basically, I am trying to use them in a paypal scam.&nbsp; So, wish me luck!

				First let me say, I have been doing &quot;cash outs&quot; for over 5 years now and You always need more then one way. Gold, Silver and metals are great but then if you want cash you need up with the same need to &quot;cash out&quot;. For small amounts under 1-2k, I would just buy Gold (Gold can be tracked just to let you know) or use a &quot;cash out&quot; service on SR. You will need away to get valid SSN and DOB (not sharing) for&nbsp; anything more then 10k you are going to have to invest to become a ghost. It can be done and will cost you around 10-30% depends of who you use. If you take trips around the world a banking passport always works great. Looking into panama passport CD account and you get a 5 year passport &quot; This program allows foreigners to immediately obtain a Panamanian Passport under the condition that they make a 5 year time deposit (certificate of deposit - &quot;CD&quot;), at the Banco Nacional de Panama, which earns a minimum of US$750 per month in interest income.&quot;<br />I keep my income&nbsp; <br /><br />40% Gold and Silver (Savings)<br />30% Cash<br />30% Bitcoin ( They are growing why cash out now) <br /><br />In a nut-shell just do like the rich white guys do and you&#039;ll be ok.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />hope this helps some<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Yeah how the hell can gold be tracked, were not talking about bricks here with serials on them, coins are fine and dont have any markings like that. Worse case u just melt the fucking bricks down and recast them, its fucking gold for christs sake. Gold buyers are supposed to get ur id by law, so get a fake id and give em ur &quot;name&quot; cause they&#039;re not the police and cant scan ur id to see if its legit.

				If you get bitcoins anonymously through a service like bitinstant (bitinstant grrr...), then it would be near impossible to track it. For extra safety you can visit the site you are buying from and your wallet site through a proxy or at a local cafe. Good luck tracking that!<br /><br />-mm

If it&#039;s ever found, you still don&#039;t have an explanation to why it is there. <br /><br />So, the name of the title is mis-leading, it should be change to &quot;Using pre-paid debit cards to store my cash&quot;
