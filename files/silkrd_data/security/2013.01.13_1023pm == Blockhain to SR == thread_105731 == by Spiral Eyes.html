				Hey peeps.<br />&nbsp; So I&#039;m ready to make my first purchase, and after searching for answers, I need to post and make sure I&#039;m where I need to be. Obviously, there&#039;s a lot at stake if I&#039;m fucking something up here.<br />&nbsp; I used bitinstant and had it sent to zipzap through a moneygram , which I paid cash for at cvs. I had the btc sent to my blockchain wallet. Now, I used real info for everything, because my reading told me that it&#039;s safe to do so, since coins get tumbled. And I got id&#039;d and all that ..<br />&nbsp; So now that my btc is sitting in my blockchain wallet, given that I used real name etc, should I do anything more with them before I send them to my Sr wallet? <br />&nbsp; Thanks everyone.

				SR has a built-in coin tumbler that tumbles the coins when they get to your SR wallet.&nbsp; In my opinion, you don&#039;t need to do anything more than you&#039;ve already done.

				Sweet. Thanks. I just needed reassurance after reading about peeps using multiple wallets and bitcoinfog,&nbsp; etc. I figured that since I&#039;m browsing through tor on an encrypted flash drive, using money gram and a wallet, then tumbling at Sr, that I was probably good to go. Thanks a lot man

				Do you guys recommend using fake or real info for your blockchain wallet?<br />If there is a problem, will i have issues accesing my account?

Furthermore, I saved ALL my important data,i.e. passwords etc on an encrypted flash drive using truecrypt, where I also do my tor browsing from. That way I don&#039;t need to leave paper traces lying around.

				If you use your real info the wallet, you best use your real info for every other link along the chain of getting bitcoins into SR.&nbsp; Otherwise when they scan all these transactions and whatnot, the ones who have differing names but obviously are linked straight to eachother in transactions would be the first ones that got flagged for further checking.<br /><br />So use the same fake name or same real name.&nbsp; Whatever you&#039;re comfortable with.&nbsp; I&#039;m one of the ones who thinks it&#039;s pointless to lie about your name and bitcoins, as a large portion of the bitcoin transactions on any given day have nothing to do with SR.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a known fact that SR is a sizeable portion of the bitcoin economy... so if it comes to it, sure, they&#039;ll make use of that evidence. But I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll come to it, so I wouldn&#039;t worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;But again, make it the same fake info all the way to SR, or the same real info.

Gox&gt;Bitcoin Wallet&gt;SR Wallet.&nbsp; I never use the exact amount of Bitcoins I buy for a purchase on SR, I always throw more than necessary for whatever purchase I make simply so there isn&#039;t $XX.XX going in and the same amount being taken back out by the vendor.&nbsp; This is probably not necessary but it&#039;s just something I do to obfuscate things a bit more.. not to mention, on one of the first purchases I made by the time I got my Bitcoins from my offline wallet to my SR wallet the price of coins went down so I was short by a very small amount, causing me to have to wait another week to process more money to buy the amount I was short.&nbsp; Since then, I always do at least $5 more per item than I need.
