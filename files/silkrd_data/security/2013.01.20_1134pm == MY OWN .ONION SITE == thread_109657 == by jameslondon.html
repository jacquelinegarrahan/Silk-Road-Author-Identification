				Hi there, i am seriously interested in setting up my own .onion site such as the<br />silkroad marketplace that works under tor.<br /><br />I am looking for a business partner that will look after the IT technical side while<br />i will run the site and do customer service etc.<br /><br />I am able to fund the site and am looking for a long term partner that has the<br />required technical expertise and that is very trustworthy. MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY<br />NEED TO KNOW HOW TO HIDE FROM THE AUTHORITIES AT EVERY STEP AND HOW TO CONCEAL AND<br />HIDE OR CASH OUT BITCOINS ETC AND MAKE THE SITE A LONG TERM AND PROFITABLE SITE.<br /><br />I have some knowledge on computing but require someone who has full<br />expertise on keeping the site completely hidden from law enforcement. They<br />should have knowledge on linux, encryption, keeping servers running 24/7 even if<br />attacked, and any other subject in running the site.<br /><br />Will you be able to help me?<br /><br />I do not just want to buy a simple onion url and cart and be left on my own to run it. <br /><br />I need someone that can implement many features that are needed that has the<br />best of the main onion marketplaces.<br /><br />Features such as =<br /><br />Custom design/ reliable shopping cart/ forum/ live chat/ nearly perfect<br />anonymity/ bitcoin washing/ New categories etc <br /><br />Can you give me an example of a onion marketplace you have setup? Or can you<br />show me the workings of a site you designed?<br /><br />Also please can you tell me what expertise you have in terms of<br />webdesign/programming/linux/encryption/onion/tor etc<br /><br /><br />Please also tell me more about the hosting that you aim to use? Is it freedom<br />hosting? I understand that silk road first started using freedom hosting but then<br />had issues with this, they then moved to their own<br />dedicated hidden servers.&nbsp; This is the sort of hosting expertise that i<br />am looking for.<br /><br />Please get back to me as to what exactly your service includes and what you can do<br />for me.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				This thread will probably be deleted, but before it is, I&#039;d like to tell you that you have bigger hurdles to overcome than the technical aspects of running a hidden service. SR competitors are unlikely to succeed for the same reason that Facebook competitors are unlikely to succeed. Facebook benefits from the network effect: everyone wants to be where everyone is. Buyers want to shop at the marketplace that has the most vendors (and product selection), while vendors want to sell in the marketplace with the most buyers. It works so well that SR can charge $500 for a vendor account and still get more new vendors than BMR or Snuj.<br /><br />BTW, take a look at the Snuj market. Started a couple of months ago, it appears to have gone nowhere, even though the site design and all that decent.

				Seriously James, Firstly, you don&#039;t need to post the same thread in different topics as that is the definition of spam. Secondly, do you really believe you will find a &quot;business partner&quot; here on an anonymous forum, to run the technical side of a new site on a hidden service? Trust is something you won&#039;t find on such sites and what&#039;s stopping this person, a potential hacker you don&#039;t know and never will, who unbeknown to you, creates a vulnerability within the site which can be remotely exploited to empty coins from various wallets/coin addresses and transfer them to their own wallets, leaving you with nothing but angry customers who had coins in &quot;Escrow&quot; that can never be recovered. This could happen in a matter of minutes and would be over in a flash, well before you even realized it had taken place. Common sense mate, cause as enticing as it sounds, at some point you have to be realistic about things and make sensible decisions rather than having delusions of grandeur.

				how could one setup there own personal page so they can drive there&nbsp; clients to it to buy? thus i dont want them to see my sourcces or else they cut me out. But, if I can create my own page for this and make postins what I have available, get it funded anonymously, and get my funds discretely that would be immensely helpful. I doubt SR has the ability to have your own private page where they cant see other vendors pages corret?

				I have extensive knowledge regarding encryption and Tor, have administered dozens of hidden services, have programming experience in multiple languages, have administered security critical servers running Linux BSD and Windows (lol), etc. With all of this said, the question on my mind is why would I do all of these things for you when I could do them all myself? Will you pay me fifty thousand dollars for an SR clone?
