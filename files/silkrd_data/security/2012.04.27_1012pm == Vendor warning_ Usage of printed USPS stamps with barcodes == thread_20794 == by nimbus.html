				I&#039;ve noticed several vendors using USPS stamps printed either using stamp software or at Post Office vending machines. These stamps contain a large barcode along with other numeric information. I can&#039;t find much information about the content of these barcodes but I must assume there is something in there that could be used to identify either the time/location of the stamp purchase at a vending machine, a stamp software account number, an order ID, etc. All of these could be combined with CCTV data, the USPS database, or software vendor database to determine the identity of the stamp purchaser.<br /><br />Please be careful and use only normal stamps. Also, if anyone can find any information about these stamps or barcodes, please share it.

				Yes I think sellers purchase DCN&#039;s and stamps at those automated machines in postal offices, I dont think it would be too hard to find CCTV footage if LE ordered a package with one of those stickers, however they would need to put alot of time/effort into caching you, the only solution would be to switch up PO locations or wear a hat or something.<br /><br />Ideally sellers would use stamps with no DCN, but then they can get scammed.

				You could always wear a hat with big sunglasses or just have another person go in and buy stamps using a prepaid gift card. The best place to do it at is a small PO with the APC machine on the side away from the counter.

				i struggle here. i know using the apc is risky even using a pre paid card, but the idea of the package blending in better is nice. <br />A bunch of stamps on a priority box just seems off to me. <br />I have always said, even the shittiest of my ebay packing probably done while smoking pot have never had a problem when they had pre paid postage and blended in. i guess it is the risk you decide to take.<br /><br />teach your kids to use the apc.

				I know many vendors use the flate rate priority packaging with the prepaid labels. I wonder if they purchase many prepaid labels at the same location with the same prepaid card then are the barcodes/identifying numbers grouped together in the USPS system? And if a package were to get seized would it be easy for them to wait for the unused labels to enter the system and then seize the subsequent packages as well? I am not a USPS employee so I have no clue. Just something to think about

				That is the smart thing to do. I would prefer to receive things with just regular stamps on it. But given the amount of reverse scammers out there none of the vendors are really willing to send anything without a DCN. Its a shame

				If the package isn&#039;t suspicious there really isn&#039;t anything to worry about. As long as it was shipped properly there will not be any problems. This thread is mostly talking about whether or not they can trace the origin of a package or where its labels were purchased in the event of a mishap such as seizure of products or arrests of receivers.

				i have been researching those bar coded stamps. They are encoded with IBI, information based indicia. it was developed by the po specifically for stamp technology. The info encoded in the pdf14 bar code is encrypted. The po is very cagey about what info is included on the stamp. I am currently trying to get a definitive answer on this. The stamps may or may not include sorting info, date/time of purchase, sending and receiving zip&nbsp; codes. Everything i have found so far skips around stating exactly what is on the stamp. I can realistically se a time whenthe digital pic snapped at the machine is encoded into the stamp as well.

They are finicky, and if the item you use is too close to the camera the machine will give you an error message saying ti can&#039;t complete the transaction. Once you get the technique down, though, it works great. I do this ijn the busiest part of the day when there are too many people to keep track of. I don&#039;t want to give away too much about my location, but out local apc station has no cameras in the 24 hour lobby, so I did a lot of experimenting nights and weekends to get the technique down. It works, but ymmv

				I actually saw one of these APC machines a few weeks ago that had the plastic/glass that covers the camera completely scratched up. It looked like someone attacked the camera on the machine with a knife. I doubt they could get anything more than a blurred and distorted image from the camera on that one lol

				Indeed you can quickly &quot;cover&quot; the camera or &quot;scratch it up&quot; (lol to whoever did that!) :)<br /><br />But...just make sure there are no other physical camera&#039;s, in the corner, or wherever watching you walk-in.<br /><br />Again, small town PO&#039;s are the least likely to have camera&#039;s in general.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />TFC
