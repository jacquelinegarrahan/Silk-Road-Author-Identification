				So i finally tried buying my first bitcoins today. made the bank deposit, yada yada yada. I came home 6hrs later and it still wasn&#039;t at the wallet that i thought it&#039;d be. So i emailed them just now (bitinstant), and no lie, within 10 minutes it was all sorted out.&nbsp; I&#039;m so shocked at how professional and fast they replied to my problem.

				This is a brief overview of my first transaction on Bitinstant: I transferred a large sum of money in multiple transactions from cash deposit into my e-mail (using Coinapult), and the transaction was finished before I could drive home, the coins were in my hands within 20 minutes. This is by far the best service I have ever used. Highly recommend, would use again AAA+++

				Yeah, so i sent it from my other wallet to SR. Should take about 15 or 20mins i think. I don&#039;t know why i always hear of people using services that take like 5 days....strange.

				Bitinstant is great. My first transaction I had my coins when I got home from the bank. The second time the bank actually screwed up and didn&#039;t put the deposit through, emailed support and they had the whole thing sorted out within a half hour.

				How do you receive BTC to an email address, and how would you get them to another wallet?&nbsp; I&#039;m not comfortable with providing the information the other exchange systems (Mt. Gox, CryptoXChange) require.&nbsp; I&#039;m used to get-bitcoin.com to just sending the coins to any wallet address I want, but for some reason they are no longer accepting deposits via Chase bank.<br /><br />Also, which banks can be used for BitInstant?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find that information on their site.&nbsp; There are no branches of Bank of America within a reasonable distance from me, which is why I can no longer use get-bitcoin.

				Bitinstant takes deposits from chase and BOA, same as get-bitcoin. I tell everyone to stay away from get-bitcoin, there are plenty of reports of people not receiving their coins from them and more reports of it simply taking way longer than their promised 24 hours. There shouldn&#039;t be much of a problem disclosing the information mt.gox asks for, just set up a yahoo mail account under a fake name.
