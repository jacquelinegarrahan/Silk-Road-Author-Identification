				In the unlikely event Silk Road&#039;s main server is seized, what precautions are in place? Is the hard-drive encrypted? I am very curious about the deletion of buyers addresses - what happens when an address is deleted? Is it just moved to free space on the server or does it actually get overwritten? If a police computer forensics expert were to analysis the server and recover all of the buyers addresses that would absolutely suck.<br />Can anyone give reassurance as to the precautions taken around this? Just curious.

				Use GPG when pasting in your address to whoever you order from, problem solved.<br />

				You seriously think DPR will tell you what security measures he has? I&#039;m sure he&#039;s done a damn good job, seeing how SR is still running.<br /><br />Mdmamail has it right with using PGP, so that even if the server is seized, your address is safe.

				it can be sized .... if DPR want it to do sized. but as I understand him, he will not sale it for any money, for him it will be like to sale his soul.<br /><br />with server behind private tor nods in different unfriendly to US feds countries, chances are zero. it cannot be located and sized. each time you connecting to SR traffic goes via TOR and then to private TOR, each time different rout. so locating it would be impossible.

				SR does NOT have a good security history. Multiple SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities have been found, SQL errors are shown when they occur, and I&#039;m pretty damn sure the whole thing runs on an out-of-the-box Ubuntu Server LAMP setup.

I hope buyers addresses aren&#039;t lingering anywhere on the box at the very least (in free space or elsewhere). Surely he can pay someone to do this kind of basic security. I would have that server fortified so much.
