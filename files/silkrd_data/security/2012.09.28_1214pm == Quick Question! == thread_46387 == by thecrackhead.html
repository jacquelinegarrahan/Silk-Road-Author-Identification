				Hello guys, I just found this and I was wondering if it&#039;s legit or if it still works this way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello everyone, this is the easyest&nbsp; way to buy your bitcoin to spend into the deepweb!<br />It got only 3% fee that lowers as much as you use it and if you become a meber like me as well.<br />It pass over an acreditated site called VirWox so you don&#039;t have to be scared to lose your money!<br /><br />So that&#039;s what you need to do! <br /><br />1) Register a free account on Second Life (www.secondlife.com) and download their wiever. <br />Second Life it&#039;s a famous virtual world run by Linden Lab setted in California.<br /><br />2) Go on http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Sinuiju/187/155/28 and click on&nbsp; VISIT THIS LOCATION:<br /><br />3) In this place you&#039;ll find some posters in wich is written: &quot;buy linden dollars&quot; or &quot;Sell linden dollars&quot;, click on them and follow the link it gives you. <br />You can even use your real data, for the fact buy or sell bitcoin is not illegal and who sell doesn&#039;t store any information at all.<br /><br />4) REMEMBER TO CONVALIDATE YOUR SECOND LIFE ACCOUNT INTO THE VIRWOX SITE, CLICKING ON THE ATM (BANCOMAT) AND FOLLOWING ALL THE PASSAGES, <br />THE REGISTRATION OF YOUR AVATAR WITHOUT THE CONFIRMATION CAN BRING TO THE SOSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT!!!<br /><br />5) As soon as you convalidate your account you can buy bitcoin in this way:<br />-First of all buy linden dollars payng with traditional ways (paypal, visa, mastercard, moneybookers o paysafecard)<br />-When you&#039;ll recieve your linden dollars (almost immediately) convert them in bitcoin and then send them to your bitcoin adress. <br />(If it&#039;s your firs time you use bitcoin it could take a while due to the downloading of the blocks from the bitcoin servers).<br /><br />That&#039;s the FASTEST and EASYEST (IT TAKES JUST A COUPLE OF HOUR, NOTHING MORE!) way to buy or sell your BITCOIN! <br />IT ONLY HAS A 3% FEE THAT LOWERS FROM TIME TO TIME YOU USE IT!?<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested you can even OPEN YOUR OWN BITCOIN EXCHANGE POINT IN SECOND LIFE! I&#039;ll give you more info on zibibbo@tormail.net<br /><br />LAST THING: LET&#039;S SHARE THE USE OF BITCOIN. BITCOIN IS THE UNIQUE MONEY NOT CONTROLLED BY THE BANKS. FUCK THE SYSTEM! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks.

				I&#039;m leaning heavily toward troll&#039;s tutorial. <br /><br />It might work to obtain BTC, but it looks overly complicated and I don&#039;t see how this contributes to your anonymity if you use your regular (non Torified) browser to use second life (I never played that game but I assume it&#039;s at least partially browser based).<br /><br />You can simply buy bitcoins from any bitcoin exchange, and send them to SR. The way Silk Road is built, this is really hard to trace back to you. Especially if you are a small time buyer, you don&#039;t have to worry about it.<br /><br />However, if you are really concerned about bitcoins tracing back to you, you can launder them through Bitcoin Fog. This has a variable fee of 1 to 3%.<br /><br />Bitcoin Fog: fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion<br />
