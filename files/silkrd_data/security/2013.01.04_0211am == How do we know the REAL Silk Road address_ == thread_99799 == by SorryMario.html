				Hi all, SorryMario here.<br /><br />I am wondering... how can I know if I have the correct Silk Road address? I&#039;ve read that the one shown on Wikipedia could easily be altered to direct folks to any number of spoofed addresses run by government stings or people scamming bitcoins.<br /><br />I currently use http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - is this the right one?<br /><br />Also, if the address ever changes again, what secure ways are there to find out the new address?

				That&#039;s the right one.&nbsp; Memorize it and stop using wikipedia. <br /><br />If the address were to change, not sure why it would, but you would be able to find it here on the forums.&nbsp;

				That&#039;s a relief&nbsp; ;D Now that I&#039;ve placed my first order I started thinking &quot;what if...?&quot; (naturally at a point when it would be too late to do anything about it).<br /><br />I heard that the address was changed once a year or so ago (but maybe that was just a false rumor). I only used Wikipedia the first time to get the address, then kept it in my password manager from then on. I&#039;m not sure why the addresses aren&#039;t simpler, like &quot;silkroad.onion or silkroadforums.onion, but I&#039;ll defintely keep them stored in a safe place! Cheers.

Yar elephant dude billiken, I popped your cherry but keep it to yourself, mmmkay, or it might come out really weird........ + 1 for correct SR launch instruction. Man, feels like I&#039;ve been talking under wet cement for whole of last month about not arriving at SR via onion.to , Wikipedia, or even Wikilinks, TorDir or TorLinks. Or whatevever the next scam is. Yar, I&#039;m well aware that TorDir is run/hosted by the same person in charge of BMR (can&#039;t remember name and title; I&#039;m baked right now).......... coincidentally, BMR is the only advertised site on the front page (or anywhere else), also coincidentally, despite having about 4 links to Silk Toad, none of them work/is the correct one. Go figure...........&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I guess this problem with new members trying to find SR will persist as you can&#039;t simply google &quot;Silk Road URL&quot; and expect it to be #1 on the first page. Wikipedia and Hidden Wiki are undoubtedly the two main SR launch sites for people attempting to drill down, protagonists of SR know that and modify links accordingly. (Bastards........ Go the phuc home if you&#039;ve nothing better to do than attack sites all day every day that are fated to fall on your Illuminati black list lol) <br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely.&nbsp; :)

				Haha, yeah I actually have the vb5piz3r somewhat memorized now. Mneumonics plus a weird memory (I can remember somewhat random sequences) helps. Even the dkn255hz262ypmii looks tractable... Doken 255 hertz 262 why pee in my eye... hmm I&#039;m working on it.<br /><br />And the &quot;SorryMario&quot; is just the Super Mario Bros theme I&#039;m running with on SR - my SR account is PrincezzToadstool... TORmail addy is InAnotherCastle, and on the forum I&#039;m Sorry Mario. None of this makes sense unless you played the old NES game lol.
