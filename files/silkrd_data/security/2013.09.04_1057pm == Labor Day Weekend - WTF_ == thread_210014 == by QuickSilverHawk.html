				So... I&#039;m not an economist. The BTC fluctuations are making me dizzy.<br /><br />Anything significant happen over the long weekend that I&#039;m not aware of?

				[Just happened to catch my eye, piqued my curiosity.]<br /><br />Whoa dude, what did you say to get that negative-to-positive karma ratio?<br />That&#039;s fascinating. You must have made one hell of an offensive post. :P

				I&#039;m not an economist either but a few weeks ago it hit 70 a pop that was an under value easy to see I bought in knowing I&#039;d make a purchase soon made over a grand when I made my purchase they where like 100 each, then it makes a bull run from 105 to 137 i believe it hit I was hoping JC would put up his listings so i could get rid of the 3gs i had before this &quot;crash&quot; bitcoin was making gains to fast so now there&#039;s a pull back, now i believe im out like 200 cause roughly cause some of my coins i bought at 130 hoping to place the purchase soon <br /><br />Basically bitcoin was under valued at 70 if i knew how to trade i would of bought in then sell at 130 almost double your money easy now we might have another beat down to like 110-100 maybe even 90 if it goes to 90 buy that will be under valued <br /><br />I dont really know what I talking about in a formal way just kind of trying to &quot;feel&quot; the market lol
