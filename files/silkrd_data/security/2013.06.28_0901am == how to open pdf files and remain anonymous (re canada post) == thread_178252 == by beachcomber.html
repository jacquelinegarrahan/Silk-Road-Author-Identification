				I want to use canada posts online shipping tool to send stuff without having to appear in a post office. the system produces a label you print, this is given in pdf format through a link that takes you to a page where the file then opens, tor prompts with a warning that an external app is required. i would save the file if i could, but i dont see any way to do this, as the link is not to the pdf itself. i think they do this for a number of reasons, but the pdf expires and can longer be accessed after 48 hrs. <br /><br />how can i open this file to print it without revealing myself?<br /><br />thanks for any advice.

				I don&#039;t know, man. Using TOR to access the shipping tool website might be riskier than downloading the PDF.&nbsp; Accessing MTGOX through TOR, for example, is a sure way to get your account flagged, and there have been stories of US vendors and buyers who&#039;ve had trouble with shipments after trying to track them through TOR. I&#039;d be more worried about the package being watched because I&#039;d gone through TOR to get the labels than I would downloading the PDF itself. <br /><br />To clarify: downloading a PDF will not *necessarily* reveal your IP address. It&#039;s just that PDFs can be injected with programs that can, when run, connect back to their originators using your normal internet connection. I doubt that the generated shipping label from Canada Post would include any links or programs that might unmask you, or at least the computer-generated barcode sheets I&#039;ve seen seem clean.. It&#039;s more likely (imo) that any labels ordered or tracked using TOR would get extra attention. <br /><br />But to answer your original question: if you&#039;re really concerned, use Tails to download the file, or run TOR through a VM and do the same. And then disconnect from the web before opening it.

				What good would privilege escalation be in tails? If you are using tails to check an unknown file then presumably you are running it without admin privileges and the hard drives of the machine (assuming there are any) are inaccessible. Can tails even catch a boot-loader or similar? <br /><br />Whatever the outcome the disposable VM thing is the solution to those problems.

				Tails has an option to login with root privileges or not. It&#039;s the first dialogue you see.<br /><br />The issue is that an exploit with root privileges can disable the firewall and/or Tor and &quot;phone home&quot; over clearnet, deanonymizing you.<br /><br />Running Tor in a separate VM, as in the Whonix setup in my guide, is much safer.<br />

So unless you opened an infected file while you were logged in with admin privileges then there could be no escalation and thus no changing of firewall rules, no? <br /><br />Unless the attack was directed specifically against tails users (which made use of the unsafe browser) then any attempt to phone home would be forced through Tor like everything else wouldn&#039;t it? Would an exploit that went through Tor be able to compromise you (other than acting as a keylogger etc and sending the information home)?

				Thank you for the link, its high time I actually did some primary research (HAH! Wikipedia! primary research?) about this sort of thing.<br /><br />What I am (somewhat ineptly) driving at is that &#039;m not sure that a standard&nbsp; type of privilege escalation attack would work on tails since (AFAIK) the root account is disabled completely if chosen at start-up. So there would be no higher level account for the attacker to gain access to.<br /><br />The tails devs seem to think that tails should be resistant to such an attack, but then they would, wouldn&#039;t they<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/forum/Root_login/

				What about just going for a coffee at a shop that has free wifi and grabbing all your .pdfs then going home and printing them. Or do you have to print them when you open the .pdf without any way to save them? Could also just find an open wifi close by and get them that way. You could also subscribe to a VPN service that isn&#039;t too pricey and access it that way and print them. I&#039;ve subscribed to some in the past with nothing more than a prepaid card and bullshit email address. I doubt they will flag VPN but they might flag Tor.

				Ah I see, now I am progressing.<br /><br />Sorry if I am being slow here but could an attack gain root privileges if there is no password set? presumably if system services require root access it can be accessed to allow them to run without any password being set by the user?<br /><br />+1 for patient explanations

				Just use wifi at cafes and be mindful of cameras. Or buy a long range USB wifi adapter and access a hundred different networks around the city. <br /><br />Also if you want to download the pdf&#039;s instead of opening them, remove all pdf file associations so the browser asks what you want to do with it (save to disk). <br /><br />Google &quot;OSX file associations&quot; or &quot;Windows 7 file associations&quot; or whatever you&#039;re using. <br />
