				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Just wanted to let everyone know that the DEA is in my neck of the woods right now doing spring cleaning. Got agents outside of my apartment complex (not because of me, I don&#039;t sell) and they made a sweep yesterday in the neighboring town.<br /><br />PM me if you think this applies to you. It probably doesn&#039;t, but I want everyone to be on their toes. Don&#039;t get sloppy.

				DEA(department of egotistical assholes)fuck em.&nbsp; Too bad you couldn&#039;t yell &#039;gun&#039; real loud and throw some firecrackers out in the parking lot and run into your building without getting caught.&nbsp; They probably have people assigned to monitor the web too.&nbsp; Like I said, fuck em

				Come to Canada, the DEA should have been abolished years ago. What they should have is a violent crimes enforcement agency that investigates street gangs and criminals who just don&#039;t give a fuck. I have a strong hate for American criminal law, and it&#039;s lack of judicial and addiction recovery support systems for mentally ill inmates and non-violent drug users. The just take your hard earned tax dollars and use it to anger addicts even more who end up committing violent offenses.
