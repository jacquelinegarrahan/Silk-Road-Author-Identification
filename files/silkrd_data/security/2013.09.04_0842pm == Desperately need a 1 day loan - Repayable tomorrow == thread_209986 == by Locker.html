				Really didn&#039;t want to do this but I&#039;m in a bit of trouble and I need to make an order tonight (0.339).&nbsp; :-\<br />I have just bought some bitcoins from localbitcoins using transferwise, but unaware to me even with express tranfer the earliest they can send the bitcoins is 2pm tomorrow morning, which I simply cannot work around. I have a party on saturday with a close friend, who has given me Â£15 to get his some LSD (as I told him I definitely could) but it was only yesterday we decided to get some LSD. This means that if this is going to happen I desperately need to order tonight or early morning tomorrow, but I am unable to do this as transferwise will send the morney in the afternoon. <br /><br />This means that I am going to have to ask here for an extremely quick loan;<br />As I have said as soon as the tranferwise money gets sent and the localbitcoin vendor has sent me the bitcoins I am able to pay you back. (So less than a day that I can repay you, but after that point the delivery will arrive on monday which won&#039;t work).<br /><br />I have never tried LSD before and am really looking forward to this night, but saturday is the only night we can do it together&nbsp; :-\<br />I can promise that I will pay you back tomorrow, and If required I am able to take a picture of the transferwise tranfer, to this localbitcoin vendor (https://localbitcoins.com/ad/21657/purchase-bitcoin-ing-direct-sepa-eu-bank-transfer-spain), but I really need them tonight as I said.<br /><br />My SilkRoad name is Lockerp and the total of the purchase is 0.3339, Unfortunately I have only bought enough bitcoins for this purchase so I am unable to pay any extra, but I can pay the exact same amount and will only be without it for less than a day (I did buy a tiny bit extra in the case of fluctuation, so If that doesn&#039;t get used I would be able to provide that.<br /><br />Thank you to anyone that can do this, I hope that I will finally learn and this will be the last time I have to do this but because I left it so late I am forced to do this. :/<br />Locker.
