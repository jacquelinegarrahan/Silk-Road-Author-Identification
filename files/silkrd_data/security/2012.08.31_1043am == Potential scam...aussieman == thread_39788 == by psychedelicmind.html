				Hi guys,<br /><br />Just letting you know I had a private mail on the forums here from a user called &#039;aussieman&#039;. The nature of the email was to ask me for 1.5 BTC. He said he would give me back 3 BTC within a few hours. This screamed of scam to me, so just letting you know. When I asked how the deal worked, this was his response:<br /><br />&quot;i´m on an site to bet btc and the withdraw minimum is 5 BTC and i have 3 btc and i would need 2 btc to withdraw them.<br />i would need that to withdraw the money, i´m literally 1 BTC too short for my order&nbsp; so i would ask you if you could lend me that for 1-2 hours and i will give you 4 BTC back i promise!<br />it will work 100% mate if not you can call me out on the forums!<br /><br />so you would double your btc within 2 hours. its no joke i swear&quot; <br /><br />In light of what has happened this week with Vlad etc, I thought it was appropriate to let people know about this.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Psy
