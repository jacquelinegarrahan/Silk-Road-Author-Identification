				Hi<br /><br />This morning my wallet at Blockchain was emptied completely and certainly not any of my own doing!!!<br /><br />Yesterday I bought a small amount of bitcoins 3,6 via a bank-transfer and received the bitcoins in my wallet as usual.<br />a couple of hours afterwards the trader (doesn&#039;t matter who - trusted online bitcoin trader one of the largest) processed the order again, by mistake, they claim at least!!<br />Also this transaction was transferred to my wallet so actually I received the same amount twice.<br />I logged in this morning to transfer my bitcoins, believing there was 3,6 in my wallet - but it was empty and I could see the two deposits (realizing the second one at that time)<br />and all the bitcoins had been transferred out of my account to 1PpViAvCj9ALTK1Nue22Xiizp1ATbt1UCG<br /><br />Obviously I have contacted the trader and they have replied instantly that they made the mistake of re-processing my order, but have no knowledge of the transaction out of my account.<br />I have also contacted Blockchain with the details as this might be a security breach on their side.<br /><br />Anyway I would like any relevant input to this as I am quite worried.<br /><br />I am pretty high on security and password security especially - I have of course scanned everything over again for any possible spyware etc.<br />for ref. I am on a Macbook.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi<br /><br />I will keep you posted once I hear from the support guys at Blockchain.<br />Of course this increased my paranoia level so I spent yesterday changing all passwords etc. etc. juts to be sure, not<br />that I found any bots or trojans etc.<br /><br />What I did find out was, when tracing the transactions of bitcoins this guy cashed in well over 100 bitcoins yesterday from numerous <br />addresses within a few hours on newly setup bitcoin addresses all pointing back to his (hers), which doesn&#039;t give anything, as it is impossible<br />to trace the location - but to me it looks like blockchain has been compromised in some level, I should have found a bot or a trojan or a ??? on my<br />laptop for him to be able to snatch my passwords, which BTW was strong.<br /><br />Will revert once Blockchain responds<br /><br />

				I&#039;m curious...<br /><br />Were you using two-factor authentication?&nbsp; <br /><br />How about the double encryption feature?... one pw to log on, another to make transactions? <br /><br />Is the PW/UN for your blockchain different from all your other UN/PW used elsewhere?<br /><br />Do you use your macbook on other wifi networks?... like at your favorite Starbucks etc.?

				Hi Yoda<br /><br />Well I have not set up the two-step however all my UN and PWs are different I never use the same.<br />I have one username for SR, one for the Forum, one for blockchain etc etc&nbsp; - strong passwords all different<br /><br />Of course seen in retrospect I should have set up those features you mention as well.<br /><br />I do access wifi networks, not in Starbuck&#039;s but in Hotels during business trips of course that poses a risk lets say Trojans etc.<br />but I never access any of the sites involved in any of this while not at home on my secure network.<br /><br />I have as mentioned scanned the whole thing forwards and backwards (Clamxav) - Nothing.<br /><br />Blockchain has not replied back yet, am starting to wodner if they will.<br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s a lot more likely that you were phished than the blockchain.info site being hacked/compromised (either way, I&#039;m sorry for your loss). Did you open any files or Java applets over the internet?<br /><br />If you had malware that stole passwords and BTC, would you know it? Probably not unless you&#039;re looking for it. I&#039;d get an antivirus/rootkit scan done on the computer ASAP. I don&#039;t know anything about Macs so can&#039;t recommend anything.<br /><br />PS-for the love of god cover-up that btc address in the post!&nbsp; (hint, there&#039;s only one deposit into it) ;-

				Dear Sorrymario<br /><br />Well phishing is not very likely as I never use links in e-mails - unless it is directly following as a confirmation of my own doing.<br />Malware is a possibility, however I have scanned, rescanned and then rescanned again - with new updates etc etc and found nothing,<br />but that doesn&#039;t rule out Malware it only reduces the possibility somewhat.<br />Java - yeah that might be as you hardly can avoid that crap.<br /><br />Well that bitcoin address belongs to whoever ripped mine, and mine and blockchain will never be used again.<br />The deposit into that, yes only one, but here comes the catch - I deposited 3,6 BTC to my account, a few hours later another 3,55 arrives which I did not put there and <br />then quite some hours later the combined amount is transferred out to the BTC account mentioned in this post and then, if you track it, out to two different addresses.<br /><br />3,6 BTC lost - annoying but...what worries me is who on earth deposited 3,55 BTC on my account, assuming it is the same person, waits quite some hours and then <br />empties the account - it just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />

				Sorry for your loss Mal. My guess is it might be the person doing the trade itself. <br /><br />I ran across this thread trying to research if blockchain is trustworthy or not.

				There&#039;s posts on bitcointalk under service discussion about this. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=301150.0<br />Use 2factor ID, or host your own wallet offline preferably.

				I&#039;m very sorry for your loss. If it&#039;s any consolation, I have $500 sitting in a wallet that I can&#039;t get into (probably worth much more than that now). My dumb ass installed a new OS on my PC without recording the address!<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s sounds as if that&#039;s an issue on the blockchain/btc end, but maybe not. That address only has 2 transactions in it&#039;s history. Looks like it&#039;s being laundered (I&#039;m not an expert).<br /><br />You may be using mac OSX, but that&#039;s not 100% secure. It&#039;s security is by obscurity; users can definitely fuck that up though by being careless (not saying you were -- just sayin&#039;). Hell, I run Linux and I&#039;m still fucking paranoid about shit like that. Every OS has vulnerabilities and the end user is the weakest link in the chain. Not to mention WiFi.
