				Ok so while holding some BC of mine, mtgox decides to require my passport number and a photo copy of my passport. They also said that they would need a copy of my heat bill or proof of residence. I am a little worried because i have dealt with mtgox very little. is this normal? what should i do? <br /><br />Oh and the point of all this is that no BC can be withdrawn from my account. They just keep telling me to verify my account. I really want nothing to do with this, any way i can just get my BC out and leave? or at least transfer my money into an account from mtgox.

				Maybe shoot them a message and ask if/how long your personal details would be stored for. I hope it&#039;s not a large amount of cash, if it&#039;s small, i would personally just move on/lesson learned etc.

				Maybe you used TOR to access MTGOX? <br />They flag all transactions form proxies..<br />That would be normal , just don&#039;t use TOR to go there again and switch acocunt once you get your coin

				is this something new that they are doing? are they becoming more strict? I have used them a bunch in the past and never had an issue or been asked for any type of ID or documents. Does anyone know if there is a limit you can deposit/ buy coins and send them off before they ask for id? If so how much? Thanks

				Hey... Weird I thought I replied to this thread before.<br /><br />Anyways, I had the same problem as you, so what I did was fake a utility bill, I have a fake residency permit here in Spain called DNI, they accept it as identification so I fully verified myself using those fake details.. So now I have a fully verified, untraceable account. What I do to top up is I opened a bank account with a crappy online bank in Spain that accepted the same documents.. the only thing is its linked to the block of flats in which I live (but not the actual flat obv) so Ive got a pretty good way of transferring money too and from at good rates and without risk.. <br />As I understand it the only way to make MTGOX safe is to put your coins through a tumbler before sending them onto SR... <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t send them your details to get verified dude, its a big paper trail, your passport utility bills, if they ever trace a coin spent on silk road as having come from your MTGOX account your fucked,,<br /><br />Anyways back to your problem, If you can transfer the coins to my MTGOX account (not a bitwallet) but my actual MTGOX account then I can get them out for you.. You will need to ask the people at MTGOX how you go about doing that But i know it can be done. <br /><br />Night<br />ACE
