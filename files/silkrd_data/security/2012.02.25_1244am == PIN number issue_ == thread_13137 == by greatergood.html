				They took care of mine the same day it was locked out. Just lock it out and reply to the message they send you. As someone else said you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.&nbsp;

It locked me out and I don&#039;t want the roller-coaster of Bitcoin value to ruin the money that is now frozen. Doing a different account would not help if your money (like mine) is already locked down because you need your pin to take money out. ARGHHH, any suggestions, I already wrote to the Support but no reply so far?!!??!?<br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about the lack of reply. They replied to my message at like 2-3am cst the same day I sent it to them. It was about a 12 hour wait. I&#039;m just guessing, but I would bet they either aren&#039;t in the US or just do their work at night after their &quot;RL&quot; is done. I actually didn&#039;t lose anything in the time it took.

				When you registered, you were asked to supply a username, a password and a second password. That second password is your PIN.<br /><br />DPR really needs to decide on just one terminology. Using two names for the same thing confuses a lot fo people. =/

The PIN is there to help prevent a hacker from getting your money. As others have said, all you can do is message SR, and wait for them to reply. It isn&#039;t their responsibility to make sure that everyone remembers their password, and PIN number.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know why so many people have trouble with this. Just write it down, or use something that you can remember! It isn&#039;t that difficult!<br /><br />

				Yeah, I just completely forgot what I used when I opened the account. They also don&#039;t word it well, cause it isn&#039;t a pin number it&#039;s an actual secondary password. <br /><br />The worst is when you setup an encrypted drive and save the password to the drive.. on the drive... Worst week ever when I couldn&#039;t remember the password. I couldn&#039;t get to SR or the forums cause the passwords and tor bundle were all stored on that drive.
