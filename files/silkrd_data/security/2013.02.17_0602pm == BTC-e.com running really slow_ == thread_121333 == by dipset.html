				So what is up with BTC-e.com lately. Usually no problems but last night couldnt get on the site, and now when I try to buy BTC with the USD I transferred via Bitinstant it just keeps getting stuck on the blue loading cycle with several refreshes doing the same thing, should I just wait to see if it eventually processes?

				I can login just fine and my funds are in my account like they should be, however, when I try to do a buy BTC request it just sits in the blue loading cycle screen, looping and looping endlessly without processing. I dont know what gives, I have tried closing and reopening browsers, the site, and logging back in, but still no dice.&nbsp;

				That&#039;s really odd.&nbsp; You could try a client that uses their API maybe -- will it let you add an API key to your account?&nbsp; That&#039;s kind of overkill for a single transaction though, and I&#039;m not sure their support for that is up to snuff... works fine with MtGox though.<br /><br />Did you recently install a browser extension maybe?&nbsp; Change your NoScript settings?&nbsp; Anything at all you can think of?&nbsp; Try running your browser without any addons at all and see if it works.<br />

				Over Tor when i try to login to btc-e.com it doesnt log me in, and with chrome on the clearnet with no extension or add-ons, I am still having this issue after numerous retries to process. It is really weird, it usually just transfers usd to btc in seconds. The API thing is a little too technical and over my head I am afraid. Thank you so much for your input though.

				Sure; I&#039;m one of those weird guys who finds it pleasant to help nice people&nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t think of anything else that could be getting in the way though... good luck with it all the same.

				So I messaged BTC-e support and oddly seconds after sending my message I retried the buy BTC process and it worked like it usually does. Go effing figure. So now when trying to withdrawal to SR, it will not send the confirmation email link to finalize the withdrawal. They say they are having problems with their mail service and are on it, but the language barrier is a little confusing and disconcerting. Example, &quot;The problem with our mail service. We are working on this problem. As soon as you send money. Thank you.&quot; I am like WTF, I already sent you idiots money and cant get it off now.

				LOL!&nbsp; That&#039;s hilarious... you should just write your emails in English, sign them with &quot;forgive my Russian, I am not a native speaker but please respond in Russian,&quot; use Google translate to translate to Russian, and then translate their response to English with the same.&nbsp; You&#039;d get much better communication :P

				So finally after messaging back and forth with support and the admin about the issue and getting unhelpful responses. I was finally able to disable the email confirmation for a withdrawal and get my funds out. It wasnt easy to deal with them, alot of repeating myself and them not fully understanding my issue, but it worked out in the end.&nbsp;

				This is more than likely because of the DDoS that many on bitcointalk are a part of. BTC-e recently adopted an alt-coin (I think Novacoin) that is centralized and also accepted 110k of its pre-mined coins. Due to the amount they possessed and the initial speculation of the coin they were trading above litecoins against the bitcoin. Basically they shorted this alt-coin and made a killing, and the bitcoin community is pissed. So in response they have withdrawn all holdings on the exchange, black-listed it, and will keep DDoS&#039;ing it until they stop operating as an exchange or forfeit the profits. Just search BTC-e on bitcointalk and you will find the numerous threads on their shady behavior. I have never used BTC-e and after this fiasco I never will.
