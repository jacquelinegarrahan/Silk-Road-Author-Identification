				I used BitBargain.co.uk earlier this week and had my BTC within minutes. Some of the guys are from the Bitcoin OTC with ratings on the WoT.<br />Bank transfer - really easy.<br />PM if you&#039;d like the names of at least 2 of the sellers I&#039;ve used.<br /><br />highly recommended

				Couldn&#039;t blame you they&#039;re just going up and up - but most vendors adjust their prices accordingly thank god!<br />Although there is a vendor I&#039;ve noticed who doesn&#039;t&nbsp; and the weed is like over 3 BTC a gram - Â£40 a gram I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be buying any of that soon lol!

				Blockchain is about the mostr reliable online method<br /><br />Local bitcoins can be good also, meet in a public place with free wi fi - cash in hand, untracable.<br /><br />Also, mining coins must be more of a profit and way less prison time than growing weed!<br /><br />How many coins would 50 600W computers bring in, consider it would be running 24/7. <br /><br />There are sellers on here who are reliable but there is a surcharge.<br /><br />And the price of coins its worth buying!

				Blockchain is definitely my preferred method.<br />It&#039;s fast, and easy.<br /><br />5.97% is really THAT bad. imo. I consider it to be a convenience charge.

				+1 to everyone that posted blockchain and ping it. !! was taking me ages previously to get coins converted and paying Â£25 for privelidge (bitcoin central - they were good but hands are ties by foreign xchange rates). Have made a deposit via Ping it, Blkchain just waiting for coins to come through..... my plan is still transfer them to my other wallet, mix it up before sending on to SR ... cheers a lot!!
