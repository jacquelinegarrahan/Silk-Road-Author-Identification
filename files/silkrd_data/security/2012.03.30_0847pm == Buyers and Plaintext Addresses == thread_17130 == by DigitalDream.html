				How sketchy would it be to sell to a buyer who just placed an order in which he simply wrote his address in plain text in the order, no encryption, security ....&nbsp; He&#039;s been a member for about 15 day&#039;s with about $2k purchases (dunno what/if any have been finalized).<br /><br />Maybe i&#039;m being paranoid, but i&#039;m new to vending so caution is a virtue.

				A lot of people don&#039;t care or have any clue about GPG, or ever read these forums. <br />If people want to risk their address in cleartext should the db get ripped it&#039;s up to them I guess

				There&#039;s still no proof that it&#039;s actually the person at that address ordering.

Maybe if they were buying production equipment and precursors for manufacturing, seeds/hydro otherwise nobody will care. They want traffickers, don&#039;t care about end users

				I just don&#039;t know how he expects me to confirm shipment, DCN, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;In other words I want my money lol.&nbsp; Only concern is he&#039;s got 9 transactions, 0 finalized, 16 day old account, about $2 worth of purchases ...

				I would say that about 1/2 of the SR buyers don&#039;t use pgp in my experience.&nbsp; It would really only affect them if silkroad was compromised while their order was processing.&nbsp; And honestly pgp is hard for some people to figure out, they all want to try a program like kleopatra that complicates everything.&nbsp; People will not use command line for some reason.<br /><br />Also these same people being so &quot;reckless&quot; by not using it are out there in the real world.&nbsp; They buy products face to face sometimes, drive with illegal goods, do stupid things that are easy to get caught for.... What worry have they got about a little thing like that.<br /><br />I encrypt messages to buyers only if they provide their key, which is almost never.&nbsp; If they want to talk about something I am uncomfortable with then I force them to provide it.&nbsp; All of my pms are just, your order is on its way, thank you.&nbsp; I have never done a behind the scenes deal or negotiated with buyers, I mean they ask but I don&#039;t entertain it.<br /><br />About the other stats, meh.&nbsp; Who knows, I don&#039;t really care about buyer stats from people ordering from me.&nbsp; I mean it is great to see people with 50 txns, you know you will get paid on time.&nbsp; I have yet to have anyone with any auto-finalize and only slight refund rates order though, so my experience in that area is limited.<br /><br />But I am from the USA and only ship to USA so if I have a DCN what are they going to do besides keep my money for a little over two weeks?&nbsp; Don&#039;t know your location or what you are selling since I don&#039;t buy anything from here, but if you are US to US I wouldn&#039;t worry much if I were you.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t even give out DCNs.&nbsp; No reason to. They are solely for your protection.
