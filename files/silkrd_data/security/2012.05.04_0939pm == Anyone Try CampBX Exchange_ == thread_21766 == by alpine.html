				Yep. I used CampBX for my first btc transaction. I put $300 in a money order and mailed it from the northeast to their headquarters in Atlanta. The money went into their account the day they received my money order in the mail about a week later. I was wondering why the money order was taking a while before it went in so I contacted them and they replied the same day and said they would track it down. CampBX is very good because they do not have a huge customer base and so they have excellent communication with the clients they have.<br /><br />From putting money in the account, it had a balance of $300. I transferred half of it at a rate of about $5.20/BTC. They have very up to date rates. The transaction system is very smooth and effective once you get the hang of it. From there I transferred my funds to my SR account.<br /><br />So to summarize, they put funds in your account the day they receive your money order which is entirely dependent on the postal service. From there you can transfer your money to BTC which takes a few hours. A great feature CampBX has is that you can set a rate you want to transfer at and your order will be pending up until BTCs drop to the available rate and then your funds are automatically transferred. So if the rate is $5.50 per btc but I want to wait until it&#039;s $4.95, CampBX makes this a very easy automated process. And then to send money to another wallet takes another 1-2 hours. Overall it&#039;s very efficient and effective and they take good care of their customers. Also their commission is barely anything. CampBX is designed more for BTC trading than individual users but it worked fine for me and I definitely recommend it to people who want to use money orders. I should note that CampBX is the only BTC exchange I&#039;ve used but I&#039;ve had no problems with it whatsoever.
