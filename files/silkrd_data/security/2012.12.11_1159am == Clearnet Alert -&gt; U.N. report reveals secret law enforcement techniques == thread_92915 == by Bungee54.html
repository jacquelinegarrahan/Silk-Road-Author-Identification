				Of course We do not want to aid terror &amp; pedophiles but this report shows how our enemies are working and what we ought to do to shield us against them.<br /><br />We are in a war aren`t we ?&nbsp; Pine this is for yoU&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br /><br />http://www.hacker10.com/other-computing/u-n-report-reveals-secret-law-enforcement-techniques/<br /><br />Buried inside a recent United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report titled “Use of Internet for Terrorist Purposes” one can carve out details and examples of&nbsp; law enforcement electronic surveillance techniques that are normally kept secret.<br />

I&#039;m slipping behind. :( pine was right when she said a lot of kids (real kids, not like you, you&#039;re old) know more about security and tech than engineers and most corporations (can&#039;t remember exact words). I came up with that too, lol. She said it first ;) . It worries me a little that no one here knows where she is. (And it&#039;s a she. It says it on her profile, or at least, used to.) I won&#039;t light a candle bungee, but I will get stoned for her until she gets back. Least I can do. :(&nbsp; <br /><br />[quote author=raven92 link=topic<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=9193<br />S(he) hasnt been around for a few weeks.

Kind of weird she ^ and left without saying where though. Um. Piece out. Drug safely.

				I know pine is missed by everyone here, but without her it’s even more important we maintain the strong security mantra at SR. Good to see PGP Club still ^ even if not quite as active. And that nomad bloodbath is back again. I won’t even bother answering the war in Asia question (yep, it’s likely), or whether U.S. is more likely to revert to protectionism (nope, it won’t) as that boat now has sailed on the igiveashitaboutyourreply meter.<br /><br />(And for godssake thecrackhead, she’s a she, not a he! Why you play with us like that lol.)<br /><br />An overdue +1 to Bungee54 for posting the link *clearnet* http://www.hacker10.com/other-computing/u-n-report-reveals-secret-law-enforcement-techniques on 2012/12/11. I think everyone new to Tor should read this, and know mistakes to avoid. <br /><br />I won’t bother asking about trusted downloads for PGP as I am sure pine or someone else will have posted that on here, but while I’m writing this I can’t very well search for it can I?<br /><br />Speaking of security, wot (web of trust) at *clearnet* http://www.mywot.com is worth a quick investigation if faced with a dubious website, and isitup at *clearnet* http://isitup.org is invaluable to Tor users who keep getting timeouts and are wondering if it’s them or the website itself. Old news to most, but new users are reminded that tormail.org at http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion provides anonymous email with no verification or archiving abilities implemented. And do I need to remind new users not to come here launched from onion.to . <br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />[Crap!! This is supposed to go on either PGP Club or the other thread..... brb while I fix it ^]

You can also encrypt the system partition where the O.S is installed or the entire system drive. You could also create an encrypted file container, meaning a virtual encrypted disk is created in a file. This is the easiest of these options to set up.
