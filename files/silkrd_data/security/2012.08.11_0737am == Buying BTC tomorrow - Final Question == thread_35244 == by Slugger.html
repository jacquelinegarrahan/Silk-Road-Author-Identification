				Alright SR I feel confident enough to get my very own BTC so I can make my first purchase. All thanks to these forums! I remember when I first found SR, looked at it, my mind was blown to pieces. I then realized that BTC was way too complex for me to get any.. Well here I am, 7 months later, a day away from having BTC in my SR account. :)<br /><br />So lets get down to business..<br /><br />1. I am going to do Bitinstant cash deposit. Is it safe to do a direct deposit INTO my SR wallet? How insecure is it?<br />2. Should I do the thing where I buy 5 .05 worth of PDF or whatever so I don&#039;t have to FE? Is this frowned upon?<br />3. Let&#039;s say going into SR wallet is really insecure.. If I do an instantwallet, then through a tumbler or whatever, how exactly do I get my coins?<br /><br />I feel like I should just put it right into my SR wallet, it seems the easiest. I&#039;m not going to spend all of my BTC for awhile (probably only some right after I get them).. Not really sure if that changes anything :p<br /><br />Thanks.

I would +Karma, but sadly, I don&#039;t know how :( feel free to enlighten me.<br />So, this is my game plan for tomorrow(or the next day if something comes up..). Go to bitinstant, do the deal, print the invoice yada yada. but use a instawallet address?<br />Go to the bank, deposit the money into the instawallet address.. Then tumble it. (however that is done :x). Then withdraw into SR wallet?<br />If the BTC were to take over 8 hours to get into the wallet, would I be screwed and never see those BTC ever again?(Through the instawallet expiring...)<br /><br />Ahh I feel it would be so much easier to go through regular SR wallet. Could I go to an SR wallet, then tumble it, then to a different SR wallet? (aka have two accounts..) Or just go back to the same account... idk. Not real sure on how this BTC works just yet. Got PGP though thankfully.<br /><br />What are the odds of LE tracing a buyer of personal/social amounts?<br /><br />Sorry if these are newby questions, but I&#039;m a newb.

				I don&#039;t think instawallet expires....not with coins in anyway. You can&#039;t give karma until 100 posts.<br />Buying ebooks doesn&#039;t work, although I used it to get from 8 to 10 trasnsactions, but I already had spent a lot of money, which is what vendors look for too.<br />Buy your bitcoins, transfer to an instawallet. (make 2 copies of URL; if you lose it youre screwed!) Go bitcoin fog create an account. Go to deposit page, and find the receiving address. Copy paste it ( 2 copies again) and then go back to instawallet and enter it into the &quot;withdraw&quot; bit. Wait a couple of hours for it to show up. If you get worried there is a link to blockchain on the bitcoin fog deposit page; this will show your deposit as unconfirmed but on its way!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To send coins from bitcoin fog go to withdraw page. It will have options to send to multiple addresses over a set time ( this is how it works) You can enter either your SR address or a new instawallet. It will then send your money bit by bit. It takes at least 6 hours.

Go to Bitinstant and use my instawallet address.<br />2. Do a cash deposit at the bank.<br />3. Wait for the coins to show up.(Gonna be the hardest part, I can feel it..)<br />4. Transfer to my BTC fog address.<br />5. Immediately start the withdrawal to my SR wallet over a 6 hour period.<br />6. On Monday, do my first order of 25i-NBOMe blotters (I hope hustlehard will accept me as a new customer... I will have to finalize early)<br />7. Trip fucking balls.<br /><br />Cool. Any flaws in my plan so far?<br /><br />edit: I just realized that all of this would probably have to go down on monday.. Because of the whole business day thing..

				When I am transferring to instawallets I only visit through Tor. Use a fresh identities for each visit to bitcoin fog and instawallet. Not sure what you mean by invoice in this context?If you visit the same instawallet via clear net and Tor it reveals your identity somewhat.
