				So all of these things should preferably be able to be bought irl with cash. I need a machine strictly for surfing anonymously on the deep web. I am also looking into things like full disk encryption, virtual machines to operate a disk-OS off of.. I already have a tails DVD, the only thing that bugs me about this is I can&#039;t save my PGP keys.. On that thought, is there a way to operate an online keyring? Hosted, that way I can access it from any computer.. I also need help picking a main OS, I don&#039;t want to use windows.. <br /><br />Also this is my first post in the main forums :) Glad to be here yall, hope to find some like minded peeps.<br />PEace!

				Dual core or quad core AMD or Intel notebook with 64-bit Xubuntu 13.04 or better. Select full disk encryption during installation. Install VirtualBox and import Whonix appliances.<br />You can test this type of system by completing my Whonix on 8GB USB stick tutorial, but it doesn&#039;t use full disk encryption. Only the virtual machines are encrypted.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209572.0<br /><br />Xubuntu because it&#039;s quite easy to use even for Linux novices, and because the desktop is not as ugly as the standard Ubuntu desktop. It also needs less resources than Ubuntu.<br />Xubuntu 13.04 will not get security updates for long however, so you will have to upgrade to the next version in 2014. That&#039;s not an issue though, as you don&#039;t have to reinstall anything. Xubuntu 12.04 will get security updates until 2017, but it doesn&#039;t have the full disk encryption option during installation, unless you use the alternate installer. That&#039;s not as easy to install as Xubuntu 13.04.<br /><br />Whonix because of complete persistence, virtual machine isolated from network access and because it supports Tor entry guards, unlike Tails. Not sure if Qubes would be a better alternative.<br /><br />It may be better to not use SSD&#039;s in the notebook, though with newer SSD&#039;s there may be no issues with encryption? Spinning hard drive is enough anyway. Activate AMD-V or Intel VT-x in BIOS if possible. Don&#039;t use Intel Atom, due to 64-bit compatibility issues.

				Shameless self bump along with a new question; is there any advantage to accessing Tor via a public wi-fi connection? Want to obfuscate my identity and location as efficiently as possible..<br /><br />Thanks :)

One of its security features is the fact that when Tails is powered-down, all data created during your Tails session is erased. This is fabulous for those who do not wish to leave traces of their activities for others to find.<br /><br />However, that poses a problem for anyone using PGP in Tails, as any keys that are created&nbsp; (or other people&#039;s keys that are added to your PGP keyring) during your Tails session are lost when the session ends.<br /><br />Accordingly, it is necessary to backup your PGP keyrings to a USB stick BEFORE shutting-down Tails. <br /><br />Here&#039;s how to do it:<br /><br />* Double-click on the folder labeled &quot;Amnesia&#039;s home&quot; on the Desktop.<br /><br />&nbsp; A new window will open up, with two panes: the left-most pane will contain a list of places that are accessible.<br /><br />* Plug-in your USB stick that you wish to backup your PGP keys to.<br /><br />&nbsp; Within a few seconds, you&#039;ll see an new entry in the left-most pane; this will be your USB flashdrive.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Press F3 to open-up an extra pane; key Control + H to make the hidden files visible.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; You will now see the contents of the &#039;amnesia&#039; folder in both panes.<br />&nbsp;<br />* Click on the entry for your USB stick in the left-most pane.<br /><br />&nbsp; You will now see the middle pane with the contents of your USB stick.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the right-most pane, locate the .gnupg folder (Note the dot &quot;.&quot; in front of gnupg)<br /><br />Drag-and-drop the .gnupg folder to the middle pane (i.e. to your USB stick).<br /><br />Your PGP keyrings, GPG configuration file, and trust database are now all backed-up to your USB stick.<br /><br />* When you go to use Tails again, repeat this process, only this time, you drag the .gnupg folder from your USB stick to the amnesia folder, thus restoring your PGP keyrings. (In other words, you drag the .gnupg folder from the middle pane (your USB stick) to the right-most pane, the Tails Amnesia folder).<br /><br />Originally written by Guru<br /><br />Nightcrawler<br />4096R/BBF7433B 2012-09-22 Nightcrawler &lt;Nightcrawler@SR&gt;<br />PGP Key: http://qtt2yl5jocgrk7nu.onion/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xB8F1D88EBBF7433B (IndyMedia .onion keyserver)<br />PGP Key: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg633090#msg633090&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Silk Road Forums PGP Key Link)<br />PGP Key Fingerprint = 83F8 CAF8 7B73 C3C7 8D07&nbsp; B66B AFC8 CE71 D9AF D2F0<br /><br />

Send all the Tor traffic through the VPN to obfuscate that you are using Tor. Download some torrent at low speed at the same time through the VPN (but not through Tor) to create some cover traffic. Wait until the torrent download starts, then start using Tor. Using a VPN at home to download porn torrents is also not suspicious. It&#039;s probably one of the main uses of VPN, apart from accessing company networks. When you use it from home the VPN provider will know you real IP adress though.<br /><br />The VPN should be in a different country, which is not a Five Eyes country (USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada).
