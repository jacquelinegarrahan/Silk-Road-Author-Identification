				I saw today a police operation at the Manchester Piccadilly train station. They had a dog and were requesting that all passengers coming off the trains and leaving the platforms to briefly stop to be sniffed by the dog. As I went past (no issues for me), I saw a lad pulled aside and I could read in a glance the &quot;Cannabis warning&quot; words in the title of the statement that the copper was writing.

				Chances are that there is a big event in town and that is why they are doing that. <br /><br />I can&#039;t say about Manchester, but in London they do that all the time in tube stations that are near to concert venues. A mate of mine got snagged at Tottenham Court Road a couple of years back although he wasn&#039;t actually carrying (we smoked up on the way). <br /><br />It&#039;s not likely that they would just do that randomly. If they were then thats actively worrying, not just from a drug users stand point, that&#039;s a massive waste of resources and probably illegal in this country.

				So if the dogs smell weed on you, what do they do? Frisk you? Look in your bags? Strip search?<br /><br />If that becomes a regular thing, would it be an idea to:<br /><br />- take some lower quality cannabis, dried male plants, etc.<br />- grind it up in a mortar and pestle.<br />- casually scatter the cannabis dust around in the trains and at the station, rub it on the chairs, etc.<br />

				they do at at pubs and clubs around here on weekends. good thing is they only seem to be interested in the cattle market type places, they seem to leave the decent drinking establishments, the ones where most of the clientele ARE over 18, dressed in more than knickers and a bra and can handle their booze/narc, alone :)

				While I can&#039;t say for sure, I&#039;d definitely suspect that everytime you see the drugs dogs sniffing at random people it will be correlated to a gig somewhere in town, or the standard friday/saturday influx of party goers. <br /><br />It just seems such a complete and utter waste of time and effort to do it randomly, that even the police force can figure it out. I mean how many arrests are they going to get doing that randomly ? Like one or two kids ? Much better to do it when theres hundreds of people coming in and a decent number probably carrying.

				I too have seen a massive increase in the amount of dogs used at train station around the UK, as well as a festival I have just come back from. I have walked straight past them a couple of times now carry up to a oz of skunk, usually just bagged up and have never been flagged by the dog. This is not meant to be a claim to fame :P but suggest to me these dogs are either not properly trained, due to the great expense required and just being used as a scare tactic to try and provoke a reaction from you. Or on the other hand they may well be looking for things other than drugs such as guns or explosives, which for me I am more than happy for them to do. But dont get me wrong, they still scare the shit out of me everytime I see one. Maybe they should carry a little note around the dogs neck, &quot;Dont worry, I can only smell bombs&quot; :)

In fact it would be fairly unusual if they were trained on only a single compound because they are not exactly cheap to train. The reason why the dogs didn&#039;t alert on weed could simply be that so many people smoke weed or are in contact with those who do that the set is too large to combat, more than likely they were checking for piperonal instead (MDMA odor mimic used to train dogs). <br /><br />K-9 units are always perpetually under threat from budget cuts. There is a strong bias against them because canines lack human vocal cords and in particular their handlers are rarely politically astute even though they are often the best police officers when combined with their furry pals in actuality. K-9 are the strongest tactical tool the police have bar none, new police cars and boots on the ground might look impressive, but its the dogs that get real results. I would say a fair majority of humans don&#039;t genuinely earn their keep in the force, but the four legged friends vastly overcompensate for human weaknesses. Tell me the number of police has increased by 10x in a city and I&#039;ll roll my eyes, but tell me there&#039;s 10 more K-9 units and you&#039;ll have my undivided attention.<br /><br />I like drug dogs, it&#039;s nice to have an intelligent adversary (and cuddly!) for once. I believe strongly in meritocracy after all. By Iron, Iron itself is sharpened.

Maybe they should carry a little note around the dogs neck, &quot;Dont worry, I can only smell bombs&quot; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had a similar experience at St Pancras a few years ago. I nearly shit myself at the time, but I figured that they were dogs looking for explosives not for drugs.<br /><br />They definitely have two different types of dogs, because if you are looking for a dude with a bomb having your dog go nuts at a random kid with a joint is kinda sub-optimal.

				I know i am late to the party on this one but it is worth mentioning.<br /><br />If the police stop you becauase the dog indicated an interest in you and they subsequently find nothing, the police will always try to get you to say why the dog indicated you, hoping for you to say you smoked weed or were at a party where weed was smoked or some other shit, dont give them a reason.<br /><br />They have to record details of evety stop and search so you make sure that you ask them if it could be a &quot;false positive&quot;, ie the dog was wrong, no one needs their name in a police notebook with any connection to drugs. Plus the more false positives that are recorded the less likely they are to repeat the process.

				Sorry to go off topic abit but this was funny-- Me and a couple of mates were sitting in a park smokin and chatting and suddenly a bloke in his late 20&#039;s run into view and was sprinting fast towards us then hurdled a garden fence behind us, next to come round the corner was an Alsation off its lead plus 2 old bill :o my friend who is petrified by dogs starts running and yep the dog follows him , clamping its jaws deep into his calf and shaking its head violently . Although the dog released on command of the 5-0 his leg was fucked.. Needed skin graft off his arse :o<br /><br />Theres a good ending though , he received a healthy settlement which we all helped him through away on drugs ..... ;D

				Im guessing 99% of these &#039;stop &amp; search&#039; (or whatever the fuck they call it) result in some sort of fine? It seems extorting the public is about the only task modern UK law enforcement is actually successful at. All done under the illusion of keeping Britain safe of course.<br /><br />Are there really that many brainwashed sheep populating this island that support this kind of behaviour? Do they really believe that someone off out for a weekend with a few pills and a bag of weed in their pocket is a danger to society?<br /><br />It&#039;s sickening how passive and apathetic we are as a nation, standing by as each year more and more of your freedom is snatched away. A surveillance society is a beautiful thing and dont forget &#039; If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.&#039;

				I&#039;m wondering if I swallow a pill of MDMA or LSD or inject some heroin or whatever, can the dogs still detect it? Do drugs taken internally give off a smell in your perspiration or something like this?<br /><br />And considering this, how would you advise carrying my personal supply or heroin and pills around on public transport so that if I have to go through a dog police check it won&#039;t be detected? Would keeping it in the little drug plastic bags suffice?

				I&#039;ve seen this too, never been stopped thankfully.<br /><br />I would say keep it in your underwear. Unlikely they&#039;ll strip search in this public situation even if something is sniffed. Would that be sensible?<br /><br />Just wonder if they keep a record of these sort of stops on the PNC?

If caught again its fine/caution/court depending on amounts and number of offenses. Of course you get the officer factor put in, depending on how friendly/bothered they are sometimes they just throw it down the drain and send you on your way.<br />
