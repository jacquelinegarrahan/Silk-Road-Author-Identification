				I have been trying to find an affordable exchanger to exchange BTC for LR to purchase a proxy service I use. Every service I have found is so expensive after-that-fact between the exchange rate that they give you, the fees, etc, it&#039;s ridiculous (unless I am misinterpreting something wrong). For instance, they will say it&#039;s only a 4-10% fee, but then say that they only give you $5.80-$6.50 per BTC, instead of the current BTC exchange rate.<br /><br />Anyways I found two exchangers that have great rates but I have yet to find any info on them. imcex.com and xxchange.com , has anyone used or heard anything about either of these? Is it safe to use? I would probably go with imcex first as xxchange.com seems a little to good to be true, then again, they both do compared to the others.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have any info on either of these could I please get pointed in the right direction to where I can get some LR (or WebMoney) for BTC at an affordable rate? I only need to exchange $40-50. Apparently mtgox is taking a week or more to exchange BTC for LR so they are definitely out. I thought this was going to be a lot easier just to get some LR once I had BTC but I was definitely wrong.
