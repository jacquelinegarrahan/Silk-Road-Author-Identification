				http://www.newarkadvocate.com/article/20130207/NEWS01/302070011?nclick_check=1<br /><br />Poor kid got busted picking up 6 pounds from the Post Office.&nbsp; The quoted price by the police for the 6 pounds was $2,000.....&nbsp; That must be some low grade marijuana, that is about 333 dollars PER POUND.<br />I doubt he was a SR user but you never know.&nbsp; I know if I had purchased any large quantity of MJ, I would be scared shitless about going into a PO to pick it up.&nbsp; It sounds like they were following the transaction somehow, the article says that LE knew when the package would arrive.

				Yea, id like to think that most vendors and buyers have a smoother operation than this one. Product was probably poorly packaged etc.

				I forgot the exact years but I believe the USPS said that in 2008,2009, and 2010, respectively, ~8000, ~15,000, and ~45,000 pounds of weed were caught in the mail. In that year with the 45,000 pounds getting caught, only about 1300 people throughout the US were arrested for drugs(not just weed) in the mail. I don&#039;t believe USPS has released the number of pounds caught in 2011 and 2012 lol it would be too scary a number for some government officials to hear about.<br /><br />I highly doubt that those 6 pounds had shit to do with SR LOL. <br /><br />Kid got caught cause he&#039;s stoopid. If you know how the cops attempt to bust you nearly every damn time, you can pretty easily get away with shipping weed in the mail. I&#039;ve been doing large amounts for quite some time now. I lost a package with about as many as this Ohio git had shipped. No knock and talk, no controlled delivery, nothin&#039;. The shit just never showed up and tracking went dead in cali. Fact is, cops don&#039;t have the resources to follow up and try to bust every little weed shipment. <br /><br />I would love to know how many pounds of weed went through the US mail system in the last 12 months. I&#039;m sure the number is fucking staggering.

				I wonder that myself. How many lbs are going out of Cali everyday?<br />I&#039;ve read stories, that sometimes it was packaged so bad you could smell it.<br /><br />I guess some people do no research before trying. I know I had a hard time believing this whole setup could work.<br />If you are a big dealer, renting a dog to test your packaging is a very good idea.<br />Also the many fine people here, complaint to vendors, in a positive way. At least once it save my ass, when somebody bitched about no color guard to hide the product.<br />I later got a package busted open, but because the vendor upgraded his packaging there wasn&#039;t an issue.<br />A big thank you to who ever did that;)
