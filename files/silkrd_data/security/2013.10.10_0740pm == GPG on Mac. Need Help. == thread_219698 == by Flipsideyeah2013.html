				Hi<br /><br />I searched the forums but couldn&#039;t find anything specific. Hope I didn&#039;t miss anything through my search.<br /><br />I was using GPA (GNU Privacy Assistant) on my PC, which worked perfecly.<br /><br />I downloaded and installed the GPG Suite on the Mac and it is integrated into the EMail software. <br /><br />What is the GPA equivalent for Mac where I can encrypt and decrypt any text on the clipboard and is not associated with the email software.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />

Your only option then will be using the command-line.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and running.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve aready done that. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To copy your key to a TextEdit document, open up TextEdit, so you have a <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; blank document open. Then you can use the Insert My Key command, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-K -- this will bring up a little dialog box, where you can <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; choose your key from the drop-down box; click Choose Key, and the key <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; will be inserted into your TextEdit document.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can then use Command-A to highlight the key, and Command-C to copy it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to the clipboard. You can then use Command-V to paste your public key into<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a PM (or an email) for example.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP messages/keys into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; is selected.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; checked.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Other Commands You May Need:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ============================<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; that it needs to go.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the encrypted message that was there previously.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Guru<br />
