				Please could some kind soul point me in the right direction?<br />I&#039;m using windows, and have had a go at creating a key with a prog called Kleopatra......<br />Not sure if its the right tool for the job or not&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried searching the forum for PGP, but all I seem to find is keys that have already been generated.<br /><br />What I&#039;m looking for is some kind of tutorial and a little hand holding....... <br /><br />Hope someone can help a very confused 50 something hippy<br /><br />2Lf

				It really isn&#039;t that hard.<br /><br />first, you have to import the vendors public key. Copy it from his vendor page and save as .txt file. Then, in Kleopatra, click on file/import certificate (or simply press Strg+I) and select the .txt file.<br /><br />Now you have to encrypt your message. To do this, save the message you want to encrypt as a .txt file, and in Kleopatra click on file/sign or encrypt file and choose the .txt you want to encrypt. In the next window Kleopatra asks you what you want to do. Encrypt the file only, do not sign it. Also it is important that you select the field where it says output as text (!).<br />In the next window, choose your vendors certificate you have imported before.<br />The encrypted message is saved as a .txt.asc file, open this file with text editor or notepad, it contains your PGP encrypted message.<br /><br /><br />(Its possible that there is a faster way to do this, but this has always worked for me.)

I generated the keys but just not sure what to do next.<br />But will look at another thread which i&#039;ve just found and will try again. I&#039;m a noob so its all new to me. :-[<br />I want to make my first order soon so need to sort this out. Thanks again.

				you can always head over to : http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/ and read through the guides there.&nbsp; <br /><br />GPG4USB seems to be the newer better way to go though, so if you&#039;ve got it all setup and you&#039;ve made some keys you can just test your setup here:<br /><br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/test.php<br /><br />Good luck to ya !

				Thanks wicked, i just tried that link and its taking a long time to load after i pressed test...ah server went down, next time i&#039;ll see if it works. I managed to sort it out, but i dont seem to have a clipboard to paste the encrypted&nbsp; message to? Does it have to be pasted to a clipboard first? ??? ;)<br /><br /><br />

				the clipboard is the windows clipboard - when you copy something (crtl+c) you&#039;re copying it TO your clipboard, and when you paste (crtl+v) you&#039;re pasting off your clipboard.<br /><br />if you need to see whats on your clipboard, open up notepad, and goto edit, then paste.

				GPA is shit- just download gpg4usb. It&#039;s cross compatible with Linux and you can import keys straight from your clipboard, meaning you don&#039;t need to create dozens of little text files for every key you import like you do with GPA.
