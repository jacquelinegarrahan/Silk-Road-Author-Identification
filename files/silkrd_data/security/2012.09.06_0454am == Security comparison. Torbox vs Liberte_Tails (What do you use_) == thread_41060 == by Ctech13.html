				Ok, so I want the community opinion on this subject matter. I apologize if this topic has been previously addressed, but as you can see I am still fairly new to the forums, been around SR for a few months. <br /><br />I have done months of research elsewhere on clearweb as well as here in the deep dark. I am currently running what I have decided to be the most secure system I can as far as Anonymity, security, and efficiency. I want to hear what you use, as well as any improvements/upgrades I can make to my personal system. <br /><br />Currently rocking Torbox on a dedicated Ubuntu OS as well as a VPN, with after enough research I am comfortable enough with their services that no logs are kept, or will be distributed, at least not for the reasons I am using the system for.<br /><br />Now I am curious as to what you guys use: Torbox/Tails/Liberte or some combination, or your own completely custom setup.<br />Do you use a VPN? Yes/No? Why?<br /><br />Thanks for any input and I am open to constructive criticism,<br />Ctech

				Hey mate.. I&#039;m running a similar setup.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got Tails running on a VM inside of a hidden truecrypt volume on my harddrive. You didn&#039;t mention anything about having your VM inside an encrypted partition, so it&#039;s something i&#039;d recommend you look into.<br /><br />I&#039;m also behind a VPN. A lot of people advise against it for these reasons:<br />1. You have to pay for the VPN exposing you to a possible money trail<br />2. If the VPN&#039;s servers are seized your information may be compromised.<br />3. They don&#039;t improve safety..<br /><br />I find these claims to certainly be legit, but this is why I personally use a VPN:<br />1. It hides the fact that I use Tor from my ISP.<br />2. My VPN allows payment via bitcoin (I would NEVER use one that didn&#039;t).<br />3. My VPN&#039;s servers are located in Sweden and they have a no-log policy... A lot of VPN&#039;s claim to have a no-logging policy, and it&#039;s very possible some lie about it. I took a chance with this VPN provider.<br /><br /><br />My ISP can still see that I use a VPN.. but what&#039;s worse, them seeing I use a VPN or them seeing I use Tor.. Obviously, I thought Tor was the worse choice. It all comes down to who you trust more.. Your ISP or a VPN provider.<br /><br />

				Hey man thanks for the reply.<br /><br />I do need to look more into encryption. I have downloaded truecrypt but have yet to actually put it to use.<br /><br />I came to about the same conclusion when debating whether or not to use a vpn.<br />Mine was paid for with bitcoin from a anon one time use ewallet.<br />Also with servers also placed outside of the country.<br /><br />I will look further into encrypting my partition a little later tonight. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />Ctech

				The probaly most secure/expensive way would be ( please correct us)&nbsp; <br /><br />Create your own non-logging vpn-&gt;<br /><br />http://holgr.com/blog/2009/06/setting-up-openvpn-on-amazons-ec2/<br /><br />then use your VPN (non logging claim + sweden ..heavy privacy laws etc)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from there (doubble vpn)<br /><br />to anotherr vps you own where you vnc in and use a encrypted VM whicch torifies everything and pbfsproxy..<br /><br />there iss&nbsp; even a plugin out there which opbfuscates your traffic so it looks like a normal skype call..<br /><br />and of course connect trough free or cracked wifi / prepaid anonymous prepaid card ...<br /><br />if that isnt secure we are all lost&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />everythin paid with BTC of course--for amazon you probably can exchange btc to voucher)

I had some funny issues when I ran it (only ran it once) when I went to check.torproject.org it gave me the congrats message, and I could surf clearnet sites and see the activity in arm. However, I couldn&#039;t access a single .onion site except for ONE and it is another board I think you might be on also under a different nym, and that board always seems to connect, and it is fast as hell (for me anyway)&nbsp; very strange behavior, and yes my system clocks were all correct.

				Wow this all seems really complex. I&#039;m just using the tor browser bundle and gpg software off of a usb on windows7 . I&#039;m only going to be buying small amounts here and there though. I hope it&#039;s enough security.
