				Just tried to access blockchain.info and it seems to be down. Have some coins in a blockchain.info wallet, I hope they&#039;ll come back online soon.<br />Anybody have any info?

				This is a good reason to setup automatic backups of your wallet. If you have it, you can import your private keys to Multibit or Bitcoin-QT and access your coins.<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=150699.0<br />

				This is a good reason not to use any online bitcoin wallets.

				Well, you should be making backups of any wallet, including the ones on your desktop. At least blockchain.info will automatically email it to you whenever a change is made.<br />

				WTF?! I started a thread just for blockchain.info updates (from other SR forum users, of course) only a few days ago. This current thread will eventually be buried to never be posted on again. I wanted mine to act as an &quot;official&quot; one so it&#039;d be timeless. Anybody who was about to use blockchain could just check the thread to make sure all is in order. Then after somebody uses blockchain, they could post in the thread to keep it up to date. I got no replies whatsoever even after bumping it once asking why there was such little interest. With disappointment and embarrassment, I had a mod delete it earlier today because it wasn&#039;t getting any action. Sorry for bitching but I really thought it was a good idea and still do. I may have even gotten negative karma for it. <br />/rant<br />Oh well. Thanks for reading. <br />Anyway, I used blockchain earlier today with absolutely no problem.
