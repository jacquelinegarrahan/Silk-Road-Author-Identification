				In a few months I&#039;ll be taking the Eurotunnel to England, does anyone know how extensive the search is that they perform? I have heard about sniffer dogs and steering wheel swabs, is this correct? <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to smuggle 10 pounds of heroin into the country or something like that, it&#039;s a few gram at most that I want to take with me on the trip. <br />The mode of transport will be a car, btw&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So, anybody with some info/experience on this matter would help me a lot.<br /><br />Thanks 8)

				My sister on both recent ski trips to France via the tunnel has been stopped and had door handles and steering wheel swabbed. Travelling with her 40+ year old hubby in a 1 series bmw, I was quite surprised, and has certainly put me off that route.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been stopped at the ferry terminal in Portsmouth before I set off to France and they just asked me to get my bags out of the boot and put them back in. No swabs what so ever, thankfully, this time last year. <br /><br />

				Regular user, security is a lot higher than it used to be and all manner of hi tech shit is in use. They can x-ray a vehicle. Swabbing is common and I&#039;ve seen two vehicles I have been in given the full treatment, practically taken apart and there is nothing you can except cooperate and you will get a cup of tea for being patient.<br /><br />Even if your the most careful of smugglers, if you get a pull customs will usually find it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t go through the tunnel with anything.
