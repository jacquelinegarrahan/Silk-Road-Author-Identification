				I wonder what other people think is the best way to access Tor and why?<br />(remember not to say too much about your own personal set up)<br /><br />I like accessing Tor&nbsp; with &quot;Tails&quot;. It keeps evidence off my computer and has handy built in tools like PGP, metadata removal, photo editing, text editing, ...<br /><br />Full disclosure:<br />This is a bit of an advertisement for NW Nugz new item for sale :-) <br />(USB flash drive with &quot;Tails&quot; installed) (A portable way to access the Tor network)<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c414053bf7<br />The listing also tells how to make it yourself rather than buy it.

				Tails from USB. Less vulnerabilities than windows or mac etc etc. I would prefer to install it myself and recommend that anyone else do the same.

Using TOR isn&#039;t illegal nor is visiting SR. It&#039;s not enough for probably cause. So using TOR through a VPN is for the very paranoid. It&#039;s just extra insurance. <br /><br />Or think of it this way, piping your TOR use through a VPN to prevent your ISP from knowing that you&#039;re using TOR is just one less thing that could possibly be used against you. Would it really matter in a case that LEO found out from issuing a subpena to your ISP to divulge all customers using TOR and that you&#039;re one of them? Not really. They would need other corroborating evidence to wrap it all up. Which when you think about it, is the least of your concerns at that point. The other evidence they would have on you is sufficient enough to not have to be bothered proving you used TOR.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have a VPN already that you use for torrenting, you can add your TOR activities to it. I wouldn&#039;t recommend paying for a VPN to use with TOR. It&#039;s overkill.

That said, the idea that I might add something bad to the flash drive is totally a true concern. I think people should make there own version of Tails if that&#039;s what people think is the best way to go. Trusting me would be very risky behavior. Buying a software item like this from most anyone else is also very risky. I probably wouldn&#039;t. I&#039;m still willing to sell a few though.
