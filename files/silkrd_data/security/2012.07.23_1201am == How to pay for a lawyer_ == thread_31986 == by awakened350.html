				This has been rolling around in my head since I started selling drugs. If shit ever were to hit the fan how are you supposed to pay for a lawyer? I&#039;d imagine your money would be seized. Whats a good way to ensure that money you have set aside for such a scenario can be used as you planned? Any estimate on how much should be set aside for a quality lawyer in the US?

				I think it completely depends on what you&#039;re selling and how significant the consequences could possibly be against you. If you&#039;re worried about local police dinging you for possession with intent you&#039;re probably looking at a total of $10k for a best outcome. If the DEA comes after you full force, you&#039;re going to need to put an attorney on at least a $10k retainer and that will only last through the initial questioning.<br /><br /><br />Make sure you really want to deal with this if you&#039;re a seller, and that the risk/reward equation makes sense.

				As I only sell on SR I doubt it would be the local police coming after me. I take all the proper safety measures and only deal in research chemicals that are in the grey area but shit happens and I&#039;d like to have a plan in place.

				Get a lawyer that only requires payment after winning a case. They exist. <br /><br />Also, only potential drug money will be seized in most cases. So if you have money in the bank, police cannot touch that (without probable cause). Keep records of pay-stubs to prove that the money in the bank is from a legitimate source. Or at least have documentation proving that the money is legit.<br /><br />Really, you shouldn&#039;t keep any large amount of money on your person or in your home. It&#039;s a silly thing to do. Go open an account at a credit union or a bank. If you do large deals (excess of $1000 regularly), deposit cash in small amounts day by day. $200 would be a good amount to deposit.

Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don&#039;t want a criminal lawyer, you want a CRIMINAL lawyer.

				I would want $5,000 as a minimum for emergency money for an attorney, ideally I&#039;d want closer to $10,000.&nbsp; If shit goes bad you&#039;ll need a little money to survive on too.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest gold bullion hidden at a family members house.&nbsp; If that is impossible, get a safety deposit box at a very small credit union.&nbsp; Do not allow them to send any kind of mail to your address and do not keep the key at your address.

				As others have suggested get a good lawyer on retainer now.<br />Perhaps just give some money now to a close friend/family member, with instructions to get a good lawyer for you if you ever need one.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what your funds look like, but if it&#039;s enough, it may be worth it to invest in a waterproof lockbox. Stuff some cash in there and throw it in a pond somewhere. Again, if you&#039;re arrested you can have a friend/family member retrieve it.<br /><br />But I really don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with just paying some retainer fees now.

				The absolute minimum you will need is $10,000 to cover your ass with a good lawyer. <br /><br />Bury it. Stash it with someone you can trust. Get it as far away from your ownership as you can.<br /><br />
