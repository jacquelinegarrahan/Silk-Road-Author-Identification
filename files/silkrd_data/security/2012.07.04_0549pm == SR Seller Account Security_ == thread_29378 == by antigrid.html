				How do you properly protect against people attempting to steal your seller account (or buyer account) that costs $150? This wouldn&#039;t have even crossed my mind except I can suddenly no longer log in to my main buyer account and I have the password written down. I have tried several others just to be sure but it seems my account no longer works. Being that it costs $150 to upgrade to a seller account how do I protect myself from whatever methods people are using to jack these accounts?

				Use a strong password like this one: f!@xooUN597DE1!nkpkN<br /><br />A strong password is not a word in a dictionary, it as uppercase letters, numbers and special characters in it. A password of 20 characters like this is really strong to cracking attempts. If you use a password like Hello01 or Jimmy09 it will be cracked really fast if someone really want to. At least SR use a captcha code that helps protecting your account from bruteforce attacks. Check this site this is the 25 most used (worst) password of 2011: http://techland.time.com/2011/11/22/the-25-most-popular-and-worst-passwords-of-2011/ <br />if your password is &quot;password&quot; please kill yourself&nbsp; ;)<br />

				Make sure your caps lock is off (or on if your pw is all caps) and num lock is on. If you still can&#039;t login, you&#039;re prob SOL but I&#039;d try PM&#039;ing a mod in the forums if all else fails. They probably wont be able to help in this case but it&#039;s worth a shot since you have nothing to lose. Other than that, I can&#039;t think of a way to recover your pw. Maybe you wrote it down incorrectly? If not, use a longer and more complicated password next time that nobody but you will know. Sorry I can&#039;t be of more help.

				Also don&#039;t connect to Tor then go to Wikipedia or the Directory to find the Silk Road URL.<br /><br />Have the REAL silk road URL bookmarked, as people change the Wikipedia one to phishing websites and harvest usernames &amp; passwords.

				Strong passwords, phrases are best something like &quot;this is easier than numbers&quot; is very difficult to brute force or guess.
