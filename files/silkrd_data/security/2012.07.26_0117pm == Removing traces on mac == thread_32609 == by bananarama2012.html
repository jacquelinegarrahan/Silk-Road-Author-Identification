				I&#039;ve been researching all the different security methods that should be used when using silk road and one thing that I know I should be doing is booting from a usb and using one of the secure unix distros available. This is all very well and good but the problem is that I have been using tor on my two laptops to look up silkroad, i&#039;ve also used safari and chrome to look up sites such as erowid and bluelight.<br /><br />I want to remove all trace that I have visited these kinds of sites, but since these are my work computers I would rather not scrub the whole hard drive as I would have to spend several days reinstalling and configuring the software I use for my work. Has anyone got any tips for what I should do? <br /><br />Another related question is that I am going to start using the FileVault option to encrypt my hard drive, if in the extremely unlikely event that my computer was confiscated by law enforcement can I be forced to provide the password to them (I&#039;m in Australia)? <br /><br />Thanks :)

				I don&#039;t know much about FileVault, but I know that with TrueCrypt you can create two separate parts of the encrypted drive. One part is your &quot;dummy&quot; part, and if you&#039;re forced to give up a password, you give them the &quot;fake&quot; password. The authorities will only see what&#039;s inside of your &quot;dummy&quot; part. Be sure to put things in there that you would legitimately hide. Bank statements, tax returns, etc. Then you have the &quot;hidden&quot; part, you never give up that password, and when you enter that password in, you get access to your truly hidden shit. There is absolutely no way for authorities to know that you have two parts to the one encrypted drive.<br /><br />You&#039;re not going to have a good time getting rid of traces of browsing Tor. If you can&#039;t replaced the HDDs completely, your best bet is to reimage the machines, and then you can download file shredder from www.fileshredder.org, what it will do is overwrite all the &quot;free&quot; space on your drive 7 times with dummy data. Keep in mind that even if you do this, even if the files are not recoverable, if there are traces of illicit file names, that may be enough to incriminate you. <br /><br />Here&#039;s your bible, use it:<br /><br />http://pastebin.com/6EGZm25G
