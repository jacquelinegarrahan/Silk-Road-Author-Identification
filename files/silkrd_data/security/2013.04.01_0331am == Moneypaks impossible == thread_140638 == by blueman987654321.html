				I bought a moneypak at walmart. When i get home i try to find the number and there is no scratch off section on my card so i read the card. it has no defects or anything it says step 1 load cash to moneypack. easy it just says how to buy it. now on to step 2 it says use it&nbsp; visit this site or call this number to apply your money using the moneypak number on the receipt. empathize on receipt! ok the numbers on the receipt duuhhh. i read the receipt and theres a assload of numbers and none are labeled moneypak number <br />ok so i figured if i find out how long the number ussually are then that must be the number correct? the only 14 digit number is just ten zeros and 4 random numbers. sugar momma confirmed this is not the number sooooo CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WERE ON THE RECEIPT IS THE MONEYPAK NUMBER LOCATED MY BRAIN IS SO FUCKED.<br /><br />TL:DR i cant find the moneypak number on my receipt can u please tell me were it is located

				Damn man. Sugar mama is reputable so I would assume there is just some error on Moneypaks end. Than again anything is possible, selective scamming does happen.

				Sugar Mama is legit, this isn&#039;t an issue with her. I&#039;ve never seen a Moneypak that didn&#039;t have a scratch off on the back.

				No way did sugarmama scam you. <br /><br />I specifically suggested in the other 2 threads on this topic you created that you call the place you got the card and ask them which number is correct.&nbsp; <br /><br />Something is wrong with this story.

				the only way to talk to somebody in the greendot department is to own one of there debit cards. it ask for the card number or ssn when you call. trust me i tried to get a refund its impossible unless you have a card of theres and that involves telling them all my information.

				sugar mama has found out that the card i bought is defective and i should call greendot to get my full code. the only problem is i cant talk to a actual person to explain my problem unless i enter a debit card number and i do not own one nor can i own one any time soon.

				Just bring the card back to Walmart and tell them they sold you a defective product and you want your money back. Or <br /><br />tell them you thought you were getting a greendot prepaid card not the money pack to load on a card. You got the wrong thing by accident and you want your money back.&nbsp; <br />

				They won&#039;t issue a refund as far as I kno I used to go the money pak route it was easy but too many ways to track u. Once u purchase the card the cashe is sent totem and the store has no way to get it back as well. Not actually mailing the money mind u. I have called the number on the back and even though they say 20 minute wait I have sat there for 1.5 hours before someone got on the phone. Refund and money pak are not words that work well together.<br /><br />Try entering your code into your PayPal account and downloading the money that way or ask how sugar mama found out it was defective. More info u have the better. It will cost a few bucks here to dl the money but at least u won&#039;t take a total loss. I am glad I don&#039;t go that route any more it&#039;s kinda sketchy. Always worried it was gonna go wrong and I am sorry for your Delma!!!!

				Wait as I re read your post did u not load the card at Walmart. Like by saying here is 200 bucks cash and 4.95 for the card. Adj no they are not nor should be reloaded. Weird no scratch off cause that number is not on the recipt. Also another question. Is it a money pak rush card. It dont have a visa or mc logo on it right?? The 14 digit number is the barcode number I think the scratch off number is 9 numbers split into 4-4-2&nbsp; as far as I re,ember and with all the drugs I did I don&#039;t know of that is correct ;)

				i dont even have the code because the receipt printers messes up at walmart and it didint display the first 10 digits. walmart cant give me my money back so now i have to get a hold of moneypak and see if they can tell me it. i dont know if its walmarts fault or moneypak but ill contact both.

				That doesn&#039;t sound good.&nbsp; You really need those numbers.&nbsp; You might need a lawyer.&nbsp; Walmart is at fault and you can prove it if you have the receipt.&nbsp; The managers at places like that are often times not the most proactive people in the world, and customers of ppl on SR, so you might need to make one give you the regional managers contact information or get it yourself from the internet or helpline.&nbsp; Chances are those numbers are buried somewhere in the register or their computer system that the manager can&#039;t get to but the regional manager would know how to.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be shy about doing it, just be polite.&nbsp; The customer is always right.

				It sounds like Walmart is at fault. I don&#039;t know if green dot can help you unless you can give them that number. <br /><br />You might have to be assertive with Walmart management. Remember, you are not at fault and have done nothing illegal (yet) so there is no reason not to advocate for your self. <br /><br />Next time just use one of the less sketchey methods of buying bit coins. Since you mentioned Walmart bitinstant comes to mind. But there are other methods if you don&#039;t like bitinstant. Nothing sketchey or illegal about owning bitcoins so there is no reason at all to put yourself in a position like this. <br /><br />Good luck and I hope all goes well for you.<br /><br />
