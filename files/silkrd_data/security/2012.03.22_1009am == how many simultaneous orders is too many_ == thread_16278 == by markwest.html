				??? more than you can afford i suppose. you can&#039;t help getting junk mail in the post, which most of my orders have looked like, so if a load of deliveries turn up on the same day so what? it&#039;s highly unlikely a load of deliveries from different vendors will turn up on the same day though.<br /><br />just out of curiosity -how many have you got on the go?<br /><br />cache is right though - i probably wouldn&#039;t have more than 2 at once

				The issue I had with having too many orders were that some of the orders were the same product, but different vendors.<br /><br />Then when you get it, you don&#039;t know whos is whos and can&#039;t properly leave feedback.
