				I know Silk Road is not the place for this, but I have no idea where I would go to propose starting a new software project for an assassination marketplace web application.<br /><br />Without more research, my first inclination is to write this web app in Python, and use Django as the web app framework to speed up development.<br /><br />Django is here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/overview/<br /><br />Python is here: http://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/<br /><br />Any advice on where to go to start a project like this would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />

				What functionality do you want it to have?<br /><br />BTW, are you the same Raynardine who is posting on tor-talk?

				Betcha those vendors would demand FE.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Seriously though (as seriously as I think this actually is anyway&nbsp; :P) I&#039;d go to the Tor project website and read up on how to set up a hidden service.

				If you want others to contribute, you should market / describe it as a betting app that does those things, and not an assassination market. :)<br /><br />With that out of the way, you could host it anywhere, like Github, and run Git over Tor.<br /><br />As for the language and framework, that seems fine. A core part of this app would be interfacing with bitcoind, and you can do that in most popular languages, including Python.<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29

				Although I would prefer giving the public, the people, and the communities on Tor a chance to participate and be engaged in the project, if no one shows any interest, I will develop it by myself, alone.<br /><br />I wanted to poll people who might wish to participate and contribute to the software project, but if no one wishes to influence the development of this project, I&#039;ll happily pursue it on my own.

				I think your project is interesting, and if I have time, I might hit you up.
