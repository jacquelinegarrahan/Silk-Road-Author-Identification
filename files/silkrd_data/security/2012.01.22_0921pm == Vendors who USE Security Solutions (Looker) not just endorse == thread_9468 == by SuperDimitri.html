				Hey, so another month of reading argument after argument about security and safety on the SR. <br />I found this thread, and it has a small list of vendors that are purportedly endorsing Security Solutions. My question to these vendors is:<br />Do you endorse him, or are you actually USING the product? Endorsement and usage are two very different actions. Actors are always endorsing products they have never used. <br />I am asking vendors to sound off on this. <br />Are you utilizing this product?? If you don&#039;t want to tell in the open, I don&#039;t know why you wouldn&#039;t, but if you don&#039;t, please PM me. <br />As quoted in the thread:<br /><br />&quot;In the interest of being open I have no problem disclosing the list of vendors supporting this (in no particular order):<br /><br />IvoryUK (See his endorsement earlier)<br />tetravort<br />Paperchasing<br />PuffBuddy (Not in the top %10 anymore, but has always been a top notch vendor IMO)<br />Rook<br />warweed<br />SugarMama<br />BTC Buddy<br />Mr.DdroMcGillacutty<br />godofall (While not in the top %10 I back him as being a good reputable vendor)<br /><br />I&#039;m not selling freeware, I&#039;m selling the expertise needed to set it up properly and secure enough to make it immune from LE forensic attacks for data recovery.&quot; ~Looker<br />I can link the thread if needed. <br /><br />I am admittedly not a comp geek (genius!), but I have skills in other areas. <br />So, I am asking those listed vendors, and any other vendors to let me know if they actually use this product, or are just endorsing it? <br />I mean, I endorse the use of drugs, but personally, only inbibe in very little drugs. get the point? Endorsement means shit. Utilization means everything. <br />Thanks.

				Product there is meant for the buyer(as I understand) and not for use as a vendor. Vendor need to have better sorted out security and be familiar of aplications.<br />That device is for buyer who dont know much about those applications.<br /><br />I as a vendor dont need that solution. I have my own setup what I will not reveal to anybody. And I need to have time to understand how things work and I would feel unsafe if anybody would do it instead of me.<br />Bottom line, I do not see how many of you think that all this is very complicated.

				If they don&#039;t have any solutions for vendors, I wouldn&#039;t see why an endorsement would mean much. That is the point of the post. <br />It may be difficult to some who didn&#039;t study, or ever spend time with computers, or the like. <br /><br />I guess it all takes time.

				Endorsement is not that vendors use that product. Like I said, vendor have own security setup and if responsible, then he need to learn about software operations and they need to setup it personaly.<br />Buyer who purchase here and then have not in such extent, he have all what he need in that device + PGP vendors key (here is where endorsement stands).

				SuperDimitri,<br /><br />Thanks for posting this, on that list there are 2 vendors, not including one that is not on that list (3 total) that I know of specifically. I didn&#039;t want to post who is using vs. endorsing out of privacy concerns. But I am hoping they post up their thoughts etc. There are a few others that I don&#039;t know if they have started to vend yet. Please keep in mind I have only shipped about 8-10 units thus far.<br /><br />Several of them however already have a similar setup of their own they built, so they don&#039;t have a need for it. The endorsement is more a mechanism to provide references that I&#039;m not scamming anyone and am worthy of their trust in this regard. It&#039;s also an indicator that these vendors are good vendors to do business with (aka cross promotion) so their endorsement doesn&#039;t necessarily mean they are using it, but that they believe it to be free of malicious code of some kind and would recommend it to users that may not be taking precautions that they should.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Looker

				I use the product and find it invaluable for when I am out of my home. I can&#039;t tell you how much better I feel using TOR on my own secure usb rather than an unsecure desktop/laptop enviroment.
