				Hy dear DPR and SR-Support, -Members,<br /><br />I read that US-Financial Crimes Enforcement Network steps deeper into the BTC Currency to avoid money laundering, and i know that big amounts went through BTC the last years..<br />So what i want to know is how they will act bout BTC, and do somebody know which amounts will be suspicious to spend?<br /><br />&nbsp;I know that the bank-services have to react and contact FCEN if bigger cash amounts went through their system. but how much? and do somebody know a better way to buy BTC anonymously and secure?<br /><br />Peace People<br /><br />

				It can be assumed they will apply the same limits as with cash, i.e. $10,000 and more.

				Clearnet warning!!<br /><br />http://www.prisonplanet.com/us-begins-regulating-bitcoin-will-apply-money-laundering-rules-to-virtual-transactions.html<br /><br />&quot;The WSJ reports that, “the U.S. is applying money-laundering rules to “virtual currencies,” amid growing concern that new forms of cash bought on the Internet are being used to fund illicit activities. The move means that firms that issue or exchange the increasingly popular online cash will now be regulated in a similar manner as traditional money-order providers such as Western Union Co. They would have new bookkeeping requirements and mandatory reporting for transactions of more than $10,000. Moreover, firms that receive legal tender in exchange for online currencies or anyone conducting a transaction on someone else’s behalf would be subject to new scrutiny, said proponents of Internet currencies.&quot;

For suspicious transactions, I think the same rules governing other financial transactions apply here as well. They look for more than just transactions over $10,000. All of those must be reported by law. However, they also look for patterns, but I don&#039;t know the details. They probably don&#039;t reveal the details on purpose, just as your bank uses secret algorithms to detect fraud and protect your account.<br />

				The FINCEN rules categorize a business who transacts any virtual currency on behalf of a third party as a Money Services Business (MSB) subject to state regulation in 47 states. This FINCEN ruling is applicable to the exchangers and traders like Blue Sky Traders, Bitcopia, Tangible Cryptography. The low fees that were promoted as a benefit of using BTC will now disappear as BTC businesses will have to follow the same regulations as USD cash transfer businesses Western Union, Moneygram, etc. The FINCEN ruling does not affect consumers of BTC, only BTC transfer/exchange business. It basically is saying that just because you transact in a virtual currency, does not exclude you from US regulation of currency transfers. These new regulations for BTC businesses will mean BTC will be more expensive to use in the future as BTC MSB will have to implement expensive AML/KYC regulatory programs, the costs of which will be passed along to the consumer. The recent BTC/USD increase is people buying BTC ahead of the increased costs of regulations that are coming. We see this in many markets, large buyers will buy ahead of impending regulation. <br /><br />As far as FINCEN checking specific amounts on BTC transfers...this is not how suspicious activity reports work. Everyone knows the $10,000 limit, but what people don&#039;t understand is that banks/MSB have a duty to report ANY suspicious activity. If you went into a bank looking like a terrorist and transferred $1 to an account in Pakistan, the bank has the duty to report that. Now the chances that the terrorist will send $1 and the chances the government will care about a $1 transfer are fairly low. But this is used as an illustration of the fact that there is no specific dollar amount for suspicious activity reports. If the bank deems your activity to be suspicious, you will be reported. <br /><br />Having said all this, I will leave you with one final comment....<br /><br />I laugh at anyone who gets involved in BTC in order to follow the law.

				This is very easy to sidestep though. Sell your coins for cold hard cash to a private individual for 5% under market. Plow the cash back in to the system through you chosen means. Keep receipts of &#039;business expenses&#039; to offset your tax liability!<br /><br />Obviously this only applies to people selling coins.

				Its really awesome how this hole thing works, i still can´t believe what revolution got started some years ago, this is awesome man !<br />And no continent no state no law enforcement no politic nobody can stop this?!? Pretty awesome, i don´t want to imagine which amount<br />DPR and his crew have on their account :P , but i think it isn´t any materialistic or financial thing why this all runs, this revolution have a much higher meaning, which i can´t imagine by now. <br /><br />Somehow could it be that this year will be the beginning of a new world order? Cause somehow i feel like that, its awesome man, DPR you are awesome ! you are a biiiig guru, a revolutioner, a wizard, a master !!!Great work man !<br /><br />So is there any way law enforcement, especially in europe located states, can force you cause of the coins you transfer?<br /><br />Thanks People for the enlightening responses :)<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Government just wants their cut, so they&#039;re gonna try to keep people from moving money without reporting it for taxes. Worse case people just start buying and selling coin to eachother in an informal exchange, no way in hell their gonna regulate that.
