				Joolz makes my SR forum experience 13.65% less enjoyable. Multiply that by say 100 users on at any one time (albeit 80 of those of Razorspyne and Joolz schills :P).<br /><br /><br />Everytime Joolz comes on and posts the forum user base is enjoying being here are having 13,650% less fun than they would in a Joolz free world.<br /><br />MY mathematics are FLAWLESS. You can use statistics to prove anything, 75% of all people know that.<br /><br />But seriously, if I did a collection amongst the Sr and Hero members, how much woudl it cost us to get you to leave the forum for good Joolz? (incl Schills)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d kick in one btc, as much as I find it funny, I&#039;m starting to feel embarrassed just READING some of the threads lately
