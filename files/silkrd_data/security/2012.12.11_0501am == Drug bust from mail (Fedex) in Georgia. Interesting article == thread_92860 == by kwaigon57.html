				Apologies if this has been posted before. I&#039;ve tried to read up on all these things and I&#039;ve never seen this particular article. I DON&#039;T think this is an SR customer. Sounds like just some guy getting weed from California, however some of the details are useful. Particularly what happens when LE gets a tip. Bottom line- don&#039;t sign for shit and deny everything.

				yeah thats what I googled too<br /><br />but in situations where fedex/ups/usps has caught your package, whether you sign for it or not doesnt make much difference. if they can prove you are in control of the residence/delivery spot your gonna be charged anyways.<br />

				Yeah police swarm and give ultimatums on the spot so people cant make well thought out choices.<br /><br />Alot of people who were so strongly against snitching or police or giving themselves up have been put through the ringer and come out the other side not as solid as they thought they were lol

				Doesn&#039;t anyone watch these cop shows or murder mystery shows? you STFU if anyone comes knocking at your door. shit cops will get you to confess, THEN read you your miranda rights and then (because you think you&#039;re already fucked) fuck yourself even harder by telling them shit AFTER you&#039;ve been read your right. Solution: Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Problem solved potentially. Nothing good comes from talking with cops so don&#039;t do it and get a lawyer feigning ignorance. and who uses fedex or ups anymore anyway? person to person mail needs a warrant and they&#039;re not gunna waste time on $20 of weed to get one, not in big cities anyway. Shit, you can get away with smoking crack right in front of cops in some areas and it&#039;s considered a medical emergency as long as you&#039;re not holding a shit load.<br />fucking staties, won&#039;t even give a nurse a break on a speeding ticket IN UNIFORM. bastards.

				I think it is because people think they are smarter than what they are and it only takes opening there mouth to prove otherwise.&nbsp; LEO are trained at getting you to talk the best way to outsmart them is to remain silent. They even&nbsp; toy with people by telling them this to start.

				The part I find interesting is this<br /><br />“It’s like that because we have to observe the suspect take possession of it,” task force Commander Marc Mansfield said.<br /><br />So if ever in question or something isn&#039;t happening the way you expect, just don&#039;t ever hold the package.&nbsp; When they try to hand it to you<br />say no it isn&#039;t mine.&nbsp; Will that work?&nbsp;

LE deliberately maximise every single detail to elicit fear, from bringing in way more people than they need so the charged feels all alone, the speed they surround the house and targets even when they don&#039;t need to, agressive and threating behaviour, raised voices (there the worst in United States when it comes to deliberate intimidation), destruction of property in gaining access to the premesis (they&#039;re not goddamn SWAT and the soon-to-be-charged is not a goddamn Columbian cartel, they could simply ring and tell them to come out peacefully like they used to in the 80s and 90s), excessive noise by screeching on the brakes, crashing through fences (citing a specific case), deliberate outright lying when informing them of their rights (like one sperm drinker did to me) and a host of other things specifically designed to terrify&nbsp; somebody into shooting themselves in the foot. <br /><br />Unless you have mentally rehearsed this event, and gotten specific advice from a lawyer, it is easy to be caught up in their mindgames. But a mindgame is all it is. When they came to my property they spent [edit.] minutes [edit.] the [edit.], [edit.] it like they thought I was blind or something. Even when they were at [edit.] they didn&#039;t [edit.] but [edit.] for another [edit.] trying to [edit.] the [edit.]. When I [edit.] the [edit.] and politely asked &quot;[edit.]&quot; they said they just [edit.] and were &quot;[edit.]&quot;. I told them I would be happy to answer their questions in the company of a lawyer, and that&nbsp; set the tone form the start. It is important to let them know that you may cooperate with them under the right conditions, ie; lawyer present. If one stays silent they think they have a right to intimidate and even get physical. Let them know they can&#039;t. If they do anything outside the accepted boundaries, LET YOUR LAWYER KNOW ABOUT IT. <br /><br />anex45 is right when he/she says people lose their ice-cool focus in a bust or attempted bust because everything happens so quickly. I absolutely con-bloody-cur. But so is davidkelly when he says don&#039;t say shit b4 talking to a lawyer. But you MUST phrase it the way I did. Let them know the possibility of your cooperating depends on their attitude and whether or not they mistreat you in custody. You come across as calm, collected and knowing your right to silence. And be firm. Memorise the name of any LE who tries to intimidate you, and watch him very carefully. If they try to get tough repeat what you said. &quot;I already told you I&#039;m happy to talk to you in the presence of a lawyer. Until then there will be no further communication regarding this matter,&quot; and if one of them still pushes his luck consider adding, &quot;you do realise of course that I&#039;ll be asked (and btw your lawyer WILL ask) when my lawyer arrives about I&#039;ve been mishandled? I&#039;d like to help you in this investigation, but if there&#039;s any funny business while I&#039;m in your custody I&#039;ll be forced to divulge that and in addition I wil not be in a position to help you anymore.&quot; <br /><br />How you deliver this is important (don&#039;t raise you voice or be hostile even if they are), but you MUST DO THIS right at the moment of you arrest. It could stop you blubbering until you&#039;re composed. LE realise that early minutes are crucial and that you can&#039;t go back on it. That&#039;s why they do it -- on the way back to the police station you&#039;re already mentally recovering to some degree and getting your bearings.<br /><br />Anyway, I just want everbody to consider this advice. Sometimes it&#039;s not possible but in maybe 9/10 cases it is. No doubt some here have been arrested multiple times and know the deal and can offer even better advice. If you&#039;ve never been busted though, first time can be scary and it doesn&#039;t have to be. A lot is bluff. (Sperm drinking police prosecution filed for 55-70 years incarceration for me. The judge simply told him to sit back down. Sperm drinker.) <br /><br />And I know I&#039;m going to get a lot of rebuttal post here. I&#039;m wrong. I&#039;m attention-seeking. I&#039;m a newb. I&#039;m a sperm drinker. Whatever. I just wanted to help out. Drive safely.

I might suggest if they&#039;re intimidating or mishandling you to simply say nothing, as you can use that later on. <br /><br />It&#039;s also difficult to articulate yourself under these circumstances, and if they&#039;re already intimidating you they&#039;ll jump on anything they can. Think &quot;Are you saying you&#039;ve got something to hide?&quot; etc. <br /><br />I would, personally, say &quot;I&#039;m happy to answer your questions with a lawyer present&quot; once, and then answer with &quot;I don&#039;t wish to answer any questions without a lawyer present&quot; or silence.<br /><br />Memorizing the officer&#039;s names is great. &quot;SGT Pancetta hit me in the face, officer Honey-Glazed and officer Triple-Smoked were present and witnessed this.&quot; is a lot more convincing than &quot;Some cop hit me, I don&#039;t know his name or who else was there&quot;.<br /><br />One final tidbit, don&#039;t--whatever you do--make up a story. It&#039;ll get holes poked through it 10 times before you&#039;ve even finished telling it.

				Sound advice. I can attest that this remaining silent business is all easier said than done. But it CAN be done!<br /><br />My drug of choice was alcohol for a while and I managed to get pulled over a couple of times for things that would have been overlooked on a Thursday afternoon, but not at 3 AM on the weekend when the cops know damn well 80% (made up figure) of the people on the road are drunk.<br /><br />The first time I was pulled over on suspicion of a DUI, I made what could have been a grave mistake by admitting I&#039;d had like three beers (which sounded better than 15.) They dropped the charges because I didn&#039;t take the test and I was sober enough to not come off as a dick, but it could have easily gone the other way.<br /><br />The second time I was black-out drunk but conscious enough to remember that nothing I could say would help me. At the station, I literally said nothing. The cops rode my ass hard, but I wouldn&#039;t take any tests or admit to having so much as an appletini. As I wrote about in another thread, the prosecutors waited until minutes before the trial to drop the charges, and if I had admitted to &quot;only three beers,&quot; I honestly think they would&#039;ve tried... to try me.<br /><br />Oh, there was one other time in between those two where the cop apparently genuinely didn&#039;t smell alcohol on me or suspect anything.<br /><br />So yeah, it can be done. And don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m still out there on the roads! :) But not while drunk. I think the fourth time something would have to give... right???

				Yep, that&#039;s all pretty good expansion people. If you are hit, or intimidated, you CAN use that later on so long as do everything right like not lying when you do open your mouth. If you panic and match wits with police you&#039;ll lose. (There&#039;s 10 of them. There&#039;s 1 of you. If it&#039;s not a fair fight get out of the ring.) (btw, my [edit] actually got mad at me once for not lying to police when they were asking after [edit]. I was 13. They were AFP (feds). Not a chance.)<br /><br />Just like in Oz, your U.S. LEs know pl are likely to chance it driving home a bit pissed (15 drinks, shit, lol) at 3 AM -- that&#039;s why they sit there on the back streets at that hour. Good you had presence of mind (or balls) Frogger to not say a thing... if you said &quot;3 drinks&quot; they would have had you on lying to police. God knows how you got off without a breathalyser and blood test. And you&#039;re right not to do it any more ;) Fourth time&#039;s the charm for them, I would think.<br /><br />No doubt there are others who have got arrested more than just once; they can happily take the floor on this one. Piece out! Drive safely (not while on Ketamine). Don&#039;t share you drugs ;) <br /><br />btw Alb, yar..... I have a foul mouth when I got all pissed thinking about past, lol. I was originally going to say, cum guzzler, but I thought better of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />[Shit I just saw some microdots on SR.
