				So if I know nothing about security and took no steps to hide myself while accessing Silk Roads and moving Bitcoins, should I stop what I&#039;m doing?&nbsp; Meaning not move forward with any purchase(s) because I could be compromised. Would I be placing undue risk on a seller(s) or on myself even if I have followed the delivery steps to a T(having shipment going to a clean location...not where whatever would be stored or used)?<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t want to endanger anyone with my ignorance or place myself in danger of getting caught for something small-under 1/8 of weed?&nbsp; I have since learned about TOR proxy-using it now.&nbsp; I read the &quot;How too use SR&quot; in the security discussion.&nbsp; &nbsp;However when I first found SR and this forum I was a complete NOOB-kid in a candy store with a clouded mind and took no precautions.<br /><br />Please let me have it if I am endangering others and myself.&nbsp; Perhaps others can learn.&nbsp; <br />Am I taking the right steps to move forward?<br />1. Use TOR Proxy<br />2. Move Bitcoins back to wallet<br />3. Found another computer I can use which is not at delivery location or my house<br />4.Will change SR Bitcoin account #.&nbsp; Should I create a new username too?<br />5. Will send Bitcoins the proper way to SR per the &quot;How too&quot; in Security discussion.<br /><br />Bottom line is I am casual US smoker (married) in a new town and I have high standers as to what I smoke.&nbsp; Getting a MMP card is not feasible.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will only buy small amounts.&nbsp; Any feed back is welcome.&nbsp; Just trying to get my head wrapped around SR&#039;s do&#039;s and don&#039;ts<br /><br /><br />

				Ok, first of all, +1 one for admitting that you may have done something wrong, and being worried about the effect that may have on other people.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re talking about when you say you&#039;re using Tor Proxy... all you should need is the Tor browser bundle that you can get directly from the Tor project website (torproject.org). If you&#039;re not using that (and only that) you should switch to doing so.<br /><br />As far as getting bitcoins, and sending them to your silk road account, the methods listed in the getting started guide are outdated. If you&#039;re in the US, you should use the Bitinstant cash deposit to Bitcoin address option. For added security, you should send the coins to Bitcoin Fog before sending them on to Silk Road. So, basically it would look like this: Cash Deposit-&gt;Coins sent to NEW address at bitcoin fog (it&#039;s important to always make a new address when you&#039;re receiving a deposit)-&gt;Silk Road account.<br />Reasons why you should do it that way:<br />-All of the online portions can be done over Tor.<br />-You do not need to register for anything.<br />-You can use cash<br />-It&#039;s fast and convenient<br /><br />As far as finding a different computer to use, I don&#039;t really see a lot of benefit in doing that. It might add a little more security, but it could also compromise your security depending on where that computer is and who has access to it. If you&#039;d really like to be paranoid, use a laptop, spoof your MAC address, and always use a public wifi access point. For me personally, I don&#039;t feel that adds enough extra security to be worth the inconvenience, but it&#039;s up to you.<br /><br />You didn&#039;t mention it, but you should always use PGP. I have a strict policy of not buying anything from a vendor who doesn&#039;t use PGP. Even if there is an absolutely fantastic deal on my favorite drug, if he&#039;s not using PGP, I won&#039;t buy it. Aside from adding some extra risk for me, it tells me the vendor takes security lightly, and/or is lazy and incompetent. Any of those things are not qualities of a person that I&#039;m intrusting my safety to.<br /><br />Getting a new SR account wouldn&#039;t hurt if it would make you feel better. Might as well, since they&#039;re free and you don&#039;t have any stats that you wouldn&#039;t want to lose.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about potentially having risked a vendor. If they&#039;re doing it right, they shouldn&#039;t be very concerned about who they&#039;re selling to.<br />

				Interesting thread, Im aslo new to the site, after referral from a friend.<br /><br />I read the buyers guide but as my order was for something not, as far as im aware, illegal in the UK I went ahead and ordered. (25i-nBome)<br /><br />My route was obtaining Bitcoins via&nbsp; MT.Gox &gt;&gt;&gt;. instawallet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TOR browser/silkroad &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seller<br /><br />I put my actual address in but changed my name.<br />my username is ONLY used here on silk road and on Mt.Gox, I dont use it on any other site.<br /><br />I have yet to learn about the GPG way.. is that something I really should use or is the TOR Browser and silkroads site adequate anonymity?<br /><br />:)

I had come to this conclusion after reading for about an hour, then I saw it so succinctly put together in your post. There really is no need for any extra wallet software or dealing with any exchanges or registering fake names anywhere. Simply coinapault-&gt;bitcointfog-&gt;SR. Done and done.<br /><br />Again, thank you. I hope no one else has to navigate the maze, as I imagine it would take a lot of new people a lot longer than it took me (bit of an old hat in some regards).
