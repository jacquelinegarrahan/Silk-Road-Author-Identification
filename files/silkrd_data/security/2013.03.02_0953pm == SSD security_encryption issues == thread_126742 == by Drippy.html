				Going to be picking up a new hard drive for my computer after a close call (see this thread &gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126734.0 ), and definitely want to get a SSD.&nbsp; I know these things are impossible to wipe properly, but wouldn&#039;t I be fine setting up a separate user account that&#039;s fully encrypted?&nbsp; I&#039;m on a Mac running OS X 10.8.2 if that changes anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are two tasks I&#039;d like to accomplish (second of which is why I&#039;m posting this thread in the first place) are placing orders, and buying PurpleLotus&#039;s coupon lessons to create coupons using Adobe Photoshop/Indesign/Illustrator.&nbsp; For this, I only see two viable options...<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Make a separate user account that&#039;s encrypted, and use that for ordering/design purposes<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Buy a netbook w/ cash to use for orders, and crying for days on end while using Adobe software knowing it&#039;d be 50x faster on my real rig.<br /><br />Any other ideas?&nbsp; I know refit + tails would work for the SR part, but lord knows I can&#039;t be running design programs properly off a USB/DVD lol.<br /><br />
