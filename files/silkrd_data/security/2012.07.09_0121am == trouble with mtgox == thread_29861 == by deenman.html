				i have registered two profiles with mt gox because every time i go to log in it says the log in attempts have been exceeded for my ip adress. im using tor so it shouldn&#039;t have my ip adress right? is that why it isnt working? any one had this problem? And also im going to use bitinstant to get my money to mtgox and then from there put in through bitcoin fog and then transfer to SR. Thats a good and safe way correct?

				MtGox CLEARLY states that you will be banned for using their site through TOR! Since you are using TOR, everyone will be appearing to be coming from the same location that are also using TOR, hence that warning.

				i dont think its on the front page but thank you. i figured that was the problem. So thats why bitcoin fog is so important? because the coins in mtgox could be traced back to me?

If you were a seller with 1000-1500 bitcoins selling volume you may attract suspicion ... bitcoin fog mix your coins with another coins so it&#039;s more difficult to track i think but SR has his own tumbler system that works very well for buyers i think.

I run a service offering Bitcoins for cash in the mail which is a much more secure solution as it allows you to obtain them anonymously. Not even I will know your real identity - please see link below for full details.<br /><br />Any questions please feel free to ask.<br /><br />V.

				last time i was going to make a deposit to mt gox via barclays i noticed the issue with cash over the counter so never bothered<br />today i was having a look through mt gox and i now notice that any cash deposits made via barclays will be subject to a 1.5% fee<br />now correct me if im wrong,but previously there was no charge,then they stopped cash deposits and now theres a fee for cash deposits<br />has anybody made a cash deposit to mt gox&nbsp; via barclays recently up to now ???? did all go well ? <br />any info would be greatly appreciated,because if they are now accepting cash again this solves a big dilemma for many peeps,,this might be old news im not sure,havent been lurking for a while
