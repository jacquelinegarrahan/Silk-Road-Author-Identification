				Does anybody know what happened to bitinstant&#039;s cash deposit at a bank method?&nbsp; Used to be able to walk into a bank (BoA, Chase, etc) and just fill out a deposit slip and give them cash, they didn&#039;t even ask for your name or anything.&nbsp; Now it looks like you have to go through moneygram.&nbsp; Anybody know what happened?&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it just as easy to anonymously deposit cash through moneygram?&nbsp; I really liked the old method where I could deposit cash at a bank without filling out any info other than the bitinstant (bitfloor?) account.

				This happened awhile ago.&nbsp; They said they removed the option due to issues they were having with one of their partners.&nbsp; There are still a few places that do cash deposit:<br /><br />bitcopia<br />Blue Sky Traders<br /><br />I&#039;m sure others as well, but those are the two I can think of right now.

				Cash deposit through Moneygram has worked for me several times and can be confusing at first but in the end I like more than banks due to the fact that the moneygram locations don&#039;t have nearly as much security or keep it as long, and they are generally open on weekends and you can get your coin on a sunday afternoon if you want. There is more info here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26058.390<br /><br />Essentially as long as you have a walmart near you just come up with a fake persona: name, address which is valid in the area you live in but not yours, date of birth that looks right for your age, and phone number that uses your area code. You don&#039;t really have to memorize this unless your handwriting sucks and they ask you to correct it: it just has to look legit. No John Smiths or other lazy bullshit. They only do this so they can conform with fed regulations to check purchase names and info against international databases (and probably submit it too, so don&#039;t use the same alias twice). It can be a bit of a chore but once you do it a few times it&#039;s no more work really. Use this info to fill out the Cash Deposit via Walmart direct to Bitcoin Address option and select a walmart within your area to deposit to as this helps expedite the order since they know where it is coming from. Use your preferred underground email service for notification if you want. Don&#039;t use emails that you have used in the past for anything, create a new account for every order and never use it again. At the end of the process you will get a zipzap form. Don&#039;t print this. Copy the information onto a MoneyGram blue Express Payment form you already have or on a piece of paper to take with you if it is your first time. Take this with the cash amount for the payment to the walmart you specified as if you are paying a bill. DO NOT use cash from your wallet to pay for it. This way if they ask for your ID you can say your lost your wallet which is why you are paying a bill with cash. If this fails then just say I am sorry I will need my money and form back so I can go somewhere that will accept this and find the next nearest walmart, though this has NEVER happened to me and from what I hear 99% of people get through just fine at walmarts. <br /><br />After this go home and check your mail (you&#039;re about to place an SR order right so you want that mailbox primed and ready) and take a dump or eat a sandwich (or both at the same time if you&#039;re into that sort of thing) and go check your instawallet or bitcoin wallet and the coins will already be there. Send them to your SR account and you&#039;re golden.
