				Calm down...and breathe.&nbsp; ;) Go to your SR Account, and check under &#039;Unconfirmed&#039;. It may be listed there. Unconfirmed pretty much means the transaction is in progress. Sending bitcoins to your SR account is not immediate. My bitcoins usually hit &#039;Unconfirmed&#039; status within 12 hours. And it can take up to 3 days for complete transaction in my experience. There are lots of factors...depending on country, payment method, the site you&#039;re withdrawing from, etc..&nbsp; I&#039;m not familiar with Bitcoin7. Check hxxps://bitcoin7.com/index.php?show=withdraw_funds. They have a table based on destination/source and payment method. Considering it&#039;s only been 5 hours, you can probably take a deep breath.

				Absolutely: some times it can take a bit: about 12 hrs seems to be the norm.&nbsp; I only had one time where after 24 hrs it still showed nothing...and I notified SR and it was fixed immediately.&nbsp; &nbsp;Patience is hard, and I know: it seems you have btc floating around in the universe somewhere...I&#039;ve been there, but I&#039;ve yet to loose anything on SR.&nbsp; I had just sent a *bunch* of btc to SR, right before it went down seriously for days, during the &#039;Dark Ages&#039; a few months ago, when we weren&#039;t sure *what* had happened...but they came back, and I&#039;m sure yours are just on their merry way to your account here&nbsp; :)
