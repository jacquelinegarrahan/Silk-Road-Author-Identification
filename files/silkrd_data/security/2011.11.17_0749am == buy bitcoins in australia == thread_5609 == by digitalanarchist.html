				Is it a good idea to buy bitcoins using this method: http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/ <br />Couldn&#039;t it lead to someone being exposed?

				In my opinion, it is as good as any other way. You can use false information, no one cares. Just put the money in and wait for the bitcoins. Remember to take a photo of the deposit slip that the person behind the counter gives you so you can send a copy to verify your deposit.<br /><br />Main problem with this method is the HUGE markup on the current BTC price. I recently bought them through this site for ~$A3.30 while the other exchanges (and even SR) were claiming BTC value was about US$2.40 (or pretty close). Considering our Aussie dollar is (was) stronger than the US we should be getting a way better deal.<br /><br />But, no disrespect to the http://spendbitcoins.com/buybitcoinsinaustralia/ website because at least we can buy the damn things without too much trouble.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not what most people want to hear but after a few strange incidents lately with my orders I think bitcoins are ridiculous and we need to find a much, MUCH better way of transferring money anonymously.

				yeah spendbitcoins (aunz.ws) is great used this service the other day.<br /><br />Bitpiggy is great too as you don&#039;t need to visit the bank branch at all, you can just transfer monies through the internet. although he hasnt had bitcoins all this week now. Have had a successful transaction with bitpiggy about&nbsp; a week ago though.

				I am avoiding Australian BTC vendors. Sure it&#039;s quick, but these guys are all budding Harvey Normans, I&#039;m so fuckin over paying too much for everything that money can buy, just -becuzz...<br />Our dollar is one of the strongest currencies on the planet and will remain so as Europe and the States go to hell in a hand cart financially. <br />It&#039;s time Aussies told other Aussies to shove it where the sun don&#039;t shine -until they do business like the rest of the planet. (It&#039;s not like we NEED almost 75% of the shit we actually buy...)<br />But it&#039;s like comedian &#039;Akmal&#039; says, you won&#039;t ever get a revolution here (in Aus) cos we are too laid back to give a fuck.<br />Not this little pink duck... I think $3.10 is fucking outrageous given what a US dollar buys in terms of bitcoins. I Do give a fuck, and I can wait a few days...weeks... whatever.

Other vendors offer the same &#039;convenience&#039; in their own territories at sensible prices AND still make a profit.<br /><br />It just shits me to tears that Australians, even armed with new information, still seem inexplicably happy (super fucking happy!) to pay more than just about anybody for every good and service imaginable. <br /><br />I&#039;m not responding to attack you personally, Greynick -or Hoffa for that matter, he clearly saw fair value in the transaction -and good on him for that.<br /><br />My point is that our cheerful acceptance of commerce at a level the rest of the world clearly finds unsustainable (or they would pay our crazy prices too) is just fundamentally fucked up! What&#039;s going on in our heads that this is OK?<br /><br />Businesspeople in particular should be concerned -not happy -that we are where we are. Nobody really wins when everybody is paying inflated prices, and the rest of the world (with its cheaper offers) grows closer to us by the day

				<br />After my rant against Aussie prices (and we druggies are not the only ones fed-up with that shit) I was placed in a position where I had to get coin fast because a dealer was selling the last of a final batch and I wanted in.<br /><br />Well, I did some last minute checking with BTC Buddy and I nixed him because: he is MORE EXPENSIVE than getbitcoin in Australia plus you have to get a Western Union account (using your real name and address I presume) and then pay those shonks a fee as well!<br /><br />So reluctantly went with Hoffa&#039;s recommendation. <br /><br />The NAB was a breeze, I did not have to ID myself (BIG PLUS!) Came home, scanned the deposit stub, and got a reply from getbitcoin within 30 minutes of sending it.<br /><br />The only thing is that just about a tenth of a B200 transaction went through, I wrote back but it was after 10pm, still waiting for a response...<br /><br />Tomorrow, hopefully sooner than later, we&#039;ll see how this turns out. Stay tuned...

				Update:<br />Just before 10pm AEST I logged into SR and saw that buybitcoin&nbsp; had loaded my SR wallet with the outstanding amount, so clearly they are legit. That&#039;s the good news...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know when the balance was uploaded -sometime after 11am this morning is all I know for sure. Who has time to sit around on SR when money needs to be earned for this sporting life?<br /><br />As I said, I went this way reluctantly in order to get BTC fast, and since the turn-around speed is one of the justifications for the price of the exchange rate, not getting all my bitcoin in the one hit was beyond irritating.<br /><br />Now, I know bitcoin dosen&#039;t grow on trees, and I&#039;m sympathetic to the erratic supply and availability, but given this was my first time with this vendor, a one-line email would have been nice, just to say &#039;don&#039;t panic mate, the rest is in the pipeline&#039; as it is, nothing... not even a reply to my polite inquiry late last night.<br /><br />Also, while the whole order was fulfilled in around 24hours (quick even in the real world of fiat currency) my last advice from them was that my bitcoin -I assumed all of it at that stage- would be transferred to me by 10pm Brisbane time last night, and as mentioned I got just B23.20 -a tenth of my deal- by that time, so it was an uncomfortable 24 hour wait without any reassurance from the vendor that he or some cyber crim wasn&#039;t halfway to Bolivia with the other 90% of my moolah. <br /><br />So why the impatience on my part? My chemical vendor is ending his line of 2c-b and i really wanted to double my order on that. As it was, with only B23.20 in the wallet last night I had to order a minimum quantity on this final batch, or risk getting nothing at all!<br /><br />Now I have to order the rest (if there&#039;s any left today) and that&#039;s doubled my LE seize-risks and postage. <br /><br />As I said, an email would have gone a long way to ease my pain guys, and thanks for not giving a fuck about communicating a word back once you had my cash. <br /><br />I&#039;m not very likely to be sending business your way again, since I&#039;ll have BTC bought up well in advance of my deals from here on in. <br /><br />I think, all told, I&#039;ve given a fair and balanced account of this pretty ordinary bitcoin trading experience.

				hoffa, shiznit,<br />While we differ on the bitcion buying experience, I agree with both of you that this country needs a kick up the arse in terms of the prices we pay for everything, not just chems.<br /><br />The way to do it is keep on doing what you&#039;re doing, buy overseas... they will eventually get the message or go under, the thieving cunts, and there&#039;s always some bullshit excuse. So how come other dealers can do it? They have much of the same logistics and LE risks. Coke going to the US UK or Aus all the same issues, really. Maybe it has to travel a bit further, but puhleez, is that a really valid reason to cut it and still charge more?<br /><br />Rant over, I hope both of you -and all chem-loving aussies have a wired xmas and a trippy new year.

Was a decent amount too. She asked WTF it was, I also quickly made up that it was a Christmas present from eBay! Haha, I also have to come up with the goods. I kinda said what it was, so I&#039;m going to wait till the boxing day sales and try get one on the cheap. That&#039;s hilarious. I forgot that it was even on there. <br /><br />I&#039;ve made a fake email address and a fake name that I use for my deposits. Probably a bit over the top, but it&#039;s been working.<br /><br />Also, I only just thought the other day that I should have been getting them deposited straight to my SR account. <br /><br />I used BitPiggy the other day too, thought I&#039;d check on it and for once they had some coins so I made a deposit straight away.

				spendbitcoins is the most efficient btc trader I have dealt with. Highly recommended. No more do I piss about shifting funds all over the place. with a 7% mark up for the convenience, I think that&#039;s very good value.

I&#039;d rather not even have to answer for my BTC purchases -legit or otherwise. The cost of &#039;deep cover&#039; from end to end is worth it, no matter which vendor you use.

We have been selling and exporting most of our minerals to multinational corps who send profits overseas. By large we should be a very wealthy society with our vast minerals and resources. <br /><br />Australians are just outright lazy dumb cunts. That&#039;s a fact.<br /><br />As for buying BTC locally..fuck that..i am not paying some cunt another fee on top of more fees. I might use what hoffa mentioned though.
