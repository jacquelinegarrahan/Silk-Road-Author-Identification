				I was checking on some Bitcoin transfers and I found some withdrawals from my Bitcoin addresses that I did not create shown on Blockchain.info. It looks to me like someone has found a way to acquire Instawallet addresses and maybe even SR addresses and use them to siphon Bitcoins away from their owners. I am seeing confirmations for these transfers from my wallets and SR account but as far as I can tell no coins are actually missing...yet. Some of the transfers are for very small amounts. As a safeguard, I changed my SR Bitcoin address and moved my funds from the existing wallet to a new one. Watch out, folks. Someone might be trying to swipe your coins.

				SR tumbles your coins through multiple dummy transactions. Once transfered to your SR address they don&#039;t always stay there. Your account stays credited for the full amount however. Its for your safety and anonymity. <br /><br />Since you say they are very small it could also be the fee that you pay for a faster transaction.&nbsp; .005 or something

				Aha! &quot;I see,&quot; said the blind man. This makes perfect sense. I guess I was worried for no reason.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you, CrazyBart. I would give you +1 karma but I&#039;m still a newbie so I can&#039;t give it yet.

				LOL I just went through this a couple weeks ago, never used blockchain before so when I saw btc leaving my wallet I started freaking out. Just SR looking out for our safety.

				Awesome! Thank you, nosaj_thing. <br /><br />BTW, all of my coins arrived safely. It&#039;s so good to know about this so I won&#039;t worry in the future when I see those extra hops in my chains.<br /><br />Much love to this fantastic community!<br /><br />Does anyone know how many posts I need to make before I can start giving karma? So many of you guys are really helpful and I really want to show my gratitude that way.
