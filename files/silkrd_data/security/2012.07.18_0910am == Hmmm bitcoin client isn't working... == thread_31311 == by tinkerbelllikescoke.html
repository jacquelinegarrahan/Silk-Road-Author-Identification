				So tinkerbell had $300 sent to an address inside her bitcoin client and now it isn&#039;t working. It begins to synchronize with the network and load blocks but crashes in a few seconds. Is there any other way she can send the bitcoins to her SR address without using the client? HELP (pls) =)

				Are you willing to trust someone else? I could import your wallet and send it to your SR account, for example. But there is the risk that I&#039;d steal your coins. And me warning you of that risk is, by no means, a reason to trust me.<br /><br />Alternatively, you could just pull the address-key out from the wallet, for the address you sent the coins to. Import it to MTGox, wait the hour(ish) it takes for them to move the coins to their control, then send them to your SR-wallet directly. This isn&#039;t safe from an anonymity standpoint, but you won&#039;t have to risk getting them stolen, at least.

The actual bitcoin client isn&#039;t working so unless I fix that I can&#039;t send the coins to another address. Unless someone knows of another way? I read a bit on the net and it said something about retrieving private keys from wallet.dat? Any help is appreciated thanks guys =)

				Whether you can retrieve the key or not depends on if your wallet is encrypted(unlikely) and... whether the process is even hard. I don&#039;t know the process, so you&#039;re kind of shit out of luck in that way, at least from what I can tell you. Check around in the bitcointalk forums, or try googling harder.<br /><br />Before you do anything, backup your wallet.dat file. As for where it is located on your computer... I don&#039;t know what OS you&#039;re under, so I can&#039;t say.<br /><br />Windows would be in %appdata%\LocalRoaming\Bitcoin\

				Well, if you know how to dualboot, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll solve your problem... eventually. But, uh... you could install the client on windows and copy your wallet file over to that, even.

				Im not sure I think I just got the most recent version off bitcoin.org. Googling didn&#039;t reveal much but I have found my wallet.dat by searching the whole file system lol. So now I think Im going to switch to windows, install bitcoin replace the wallet.dat and see if that does anything lol! Will report back.<br /><br />Although this is a pain in the ass it&#039;s re-igniting my love of computers lol, I remember when I was 14 or 15 I got so into all the jailbreaking PSP stuff lol feel like Im 15 again haha :)<br /><br />Edit: well that didnt work fck. I installed bitcoin on windows and replaced the wallet.dat from the linux to the windows one but the address that got the coins sent to it wasnt showing in the client :( this is really starting to get annoying now. bitcoin on linux still wont run.<br /><br />Edit2: ok so now what im doing is I read that deleting and redownloading the blockchain might fix it so I used these commands in the terminal:<br />cd ~/.bitcoin/<br />mv blk0001.dat blk0001.old<br />mv blkindex.dat blkindex.old<br />wget http://eu1.bitcoincharts.com/blockchain/blockchain-2012-07-18.tar<br />Now gotta wait for it to download says its gonna take 4 hours then gotta enter &quot;tar -xvf blockchain-2012-07-18.tar&quot; in the terminal and hope ffs that it works! Otherwise imma be mad! &gt;:( journos say sr is easy buying drugs online BS! This is some nxt level shit! LOL hope its worth it :D<br /><br />Edit3!!! So! Ubuntu crashed while downloading some kernal panic and it reverted to text kernel. Anyway I had to restart my computer and booted up bitcoin and now its working lol! It looks like it&#039;s redownloading all blocks through the client so to anyone having a similar problem just delete blkindex.dat and blk0001.dat (make a backup of them if you want) and then restart bitcoin and the client should download the whole blockchain again. Easy as! Thanks for the help guys :)
