				I find myself using a few different banks for my cash deposits very often, and have never been asked details about my deposit or personal information. I know I have a right to say &quot;its none of your business&quot; or something along those lines, but I would rather not.<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a simple, but believable story to tell a bank teller why I&#039;m constantly depositing $500ish cash almost on a weekly basis?<br /><br />I was trying to think of one myself, and could only come up with something stupid like the company I work for gives me a certain budget for materials, and I have to return the balance by cash deposit. Probably weird that the company doesn&#039;t give me less $ to work with and the amount deposited is always similar, but at least that&#039;s better than making up a story on the spot or stuttering and sounding like your lying!

				In a house I lived in with a couple friends last year, my friend would collect our money and deposit it to the landlord each month, same exact amount. It was the same process as what you would be using for bank deposits to buy BTC, i.e. he would deposit it into her account under her name and account number. You could just say you&#039;re paying a bill.<br /><br />Is it to the same person? If so, just say you owe that person money from an outstanding balance on some work he did for you or from past due rent or something. Or keep it simple, say you&#039;re paying off a debt.

				what do you do besides selling drugs? story should be partially true... those usually work fine. <br /><br />you may trigger the software to put you on the watch list as well... much bigger problem than the teller<br /><br />why not invest in bitcoins or gold for a while... can be bought with cash... money is just paper... nothing else... piling that up might result in a bad experience. especially since you might not be able to move it fast, when u cant proof were you got it.<br /><br />if you continue to do so, i guess youll rather have trouble with the IRS than the DEA.<br /><br />

				Just get excited about bitcoin. <br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m investing in a ASIC mining pool in Norway, where it&#039;s cheaper to run the mining warehouses due to the naturally cold weather. I used to own shares in a mining pool in Britain, but, wow, those norwegians sure know there stuff! Haha, you know what I mean! Well, anyway, I first heard about bitcoin from my cousin, Dave. Actually, he&#039;s not my cousin, we we&#039;re co-cuild leaders in everquest back in the good ol&#039; days of 72 man raids! Anyway...<br /><br />And just keep going until they look like they want to suicide from boredom. They&#039;ll never ask again.

				Child support escrow. <br /><br />Or, I&#039;m being extorted by the ex-wife.<br /><br />Or, I had 2 checks bounce with this company and now they won&#039;t accept personal checks from me. And doing it this way is cheaper than the alternatives. <br /><br />Or pull a Samuel Jackson. Mumble something under your breath and when the teller says &quot;what?&quot; Say, &quot;Say what again. I dare you... I double dare you?&quot; Then wink and ask if she remembers that scene in Pulp Fiction. You&#039;ll probably laugh about it and that will get her off the question. <br /><br />Misdirection, Stan. Misdirection.

				Bank tellers have no right to question you about why or where you are depositing money other than to make sure to give you the proper IRS forms if it&#039;s a large deposit. If they ask, tell them to mind their own business. You aren&#039;t obligated to give them any story. Besides, buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal. People here are too paranoid.

I can understand paranoia there. My comment is in reference to the average guy here buying a few hundred or a grand in bitcoins to use here. I doubt any teller is going to waste their time asking questions about that. Now if you waltz in and deposit 9,999 in an bank account 1000 miles away that is going to draw red flags. Hell 5 grand might nowadays. Or going to the same bank and making repeated large deposits. If you keep it simple there is no reason to have a story. If they were to ask me, I would simply say I am sending money to a relative. It&#039;s not their business to ask unless it looks extremely suspicious, like money laundering.

				$500 a week in cash deposits is nothing to be worried about.&nbsp; if you were coming in with $5000 every week, that&#039;d be a different story.&nbsp; &nbsp;i understand the desire to cover all your bases, but the question you asked was about coming up with a story, and you don&#039;t need to worry about the story.&nbsp; they won&#039;t ask, they are most likely specifically trained not to, as i think it would be illegal, or at least definitely against company policy.&nbsp; &nbsp;you don&#039;t have to be rude and say it&#039;s none of your business, you could say you sell crap at a flea market and then ask them if asking such questions is even legal -- then they start worrying about losing their job if a manager overhears, or whatever.&nbsp; backfire! :p
