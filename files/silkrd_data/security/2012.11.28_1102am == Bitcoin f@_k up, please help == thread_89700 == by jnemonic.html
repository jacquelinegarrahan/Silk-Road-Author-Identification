				Hi. I&#039;ve just realized i&#039;ve made a big mistake while trying to send BT&#039;s to SR.<br /><br />It was my first time, but firstly i think i was using the wrong BT client? I transferred my BT&#039;s to Bitmarket, which i thought was all i should need.<br />Once they were clear for sending, i realized theres nowhere for me to deposit my bitcoins to.<br />But heres where i fucked up. Theres a window which says &#039;bitcoin address for bitcoin withdrawals&#039;. So i thought well fuck that has to be it, thinking if SR&#039;s addy is in there, it will take my BT&#039;s.<br /><br />So what do i do? The Bt&#039;s sent to fuck knows where are now frozen and admin wont reply from bitmarket. <br />Its weird, i clicked on Send BTC, but where did i send it to? Would it by some miracle have gone to SR&#039;s account?\<br />I&#039;m really confused.<br /><br /><br />I feel like such an idiot. :-[ Thanks for any help.

				If you put your SR address in the withdraw field, then the coins should be sent to your SR account. If you left it blank, I can&#039;t imagine they would withdraw your coins (to where?). You should get an error.<br /><br />So what address did you put in the withdraw field? I can&#039;t tell from how you wrote that.

				If you sent them to some random bitcoin address that you don&#039;t own, they&#039;re gone.&nbsp; No admins can help you -- not from SR or anywhere else.&nbsp; Only the person who owns that address can access those coins.&nbsp; If nobody owns it... poof.&nbsp; Gone forever.<br /><br />Astor&#039;s absolutely right though, it should have given you an error unless you actually gave it a valid bitcoin address.&nbsp; So the question is, where did you get the valid address you gave it?&nbsp; If it was from your Silk Road account page, then just wait awhile -- they&#039;ll show up. :)<br /><br /><br />BTW, the Bitcoin network has nothing to do with Silk Road.&nbsp; Silk Road just monitors the address it associated with your account, and if it sees coins get deposited to that address it credits your Silk Road account.&nbsp; But technically, DPR and the admins of Silk Road own those coins the minute you send them to your account.&nbsp; Now obviously if they were going to run off with them, they would have before now, I&#039;m sure -- but it helps illustrate that really, Bitcoin and Silk Road are totally independent.

				Thanks for the replys guys.<br /><br />I did put in SR&#039;s deposit address! Ok, so i should be good then...<br /><br />But if i didnt then i understand if their gone...will check SR now and hopefully the coins are there.<br />But i remember when i changed with drawal address i had to go the my email and confirm the address change, so it should have gone to SR&#039;s account.<br /><br />Ah! I just logged onto SR and their there!! ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />I panicked for nothing! Wo-hoo! 8) ::) :P<br />

				Yes, it can take a few hours to show up. Sometimes it may take 24-48 hours. What you can always do in the mean time is search for your address on blockchain.info. If the transaction exists in the block chain, the coins should eventually show up in your SR account.

				Yeah i basically turned in for the night hoping by morning they would be in, which they were.<br /><br />But how come it says in my bitmarket account that the funds i sent are frozen? Is frozen just another word for gone or sent?<br /><br />When i saw the BT&#039;s were available on my SR account, i sent them off to a vendour for my first purchase.<br />I PGP&#039;d with my details...but havent heard confirmation whether everything went through ok...has been all day. Fingers crossed. :P

				Bitmarket?&nbsp; Funds you sent are showing as &quot;frozen?&quot;<br /><br />Quickly googled it.&nbsp; I see very little information about this, but I find it -- odd at best, and at paranoia-worst very, very bad.&nbsp; My concern is why they would have frozen anything at all... but I didn&#039;t really put much effort into the google search.&nbsp; Just a couple minutes.<br /><br />It&#039;s weird that they &quot;froze&quot; them and yet, they still got through.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with that, but I&#039;ve never really even heard of Bitmarket before, so I have no insights personally.&nbsp; Best get to googling, I guess.

				Yeah its very weird. But yeah the coins were showing in my SR account. Used total amount i had and sent to vendor, then my SR balance showed ZERO bitcoins so frozen doesnt really mean anything. Its weird...might change bitcoin clients...

				It should show zero.&nbsp; Every sane Bitcoin client would show zero.&nbsp; You either have them, or you don&#039;t.&nbsp; That&#039;s one of the things so many Bitcoin supporters love: there&#039;s no such thing as freezing bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s absurd.&nbsp; No one has that power.&nbsp; They&#039;re not supposed to.&nbsp; Not even the government can do that, though naturally they could shut it down if they waged all out war or something.<br /><br />I have no clue what that&#039;s about, but without wanting to bother looking into it, I&#039;m going to file away &quot;bitmarket = shady as fuck, avoid whenever possible,&quot; personally.

				I&#039;m just saying that on their internal platform there could be an error where they both froze the funds and sent them to an external address, which constitutes a double spend that would be impossible in the block chain. However, the block chain only records the external transfer. Either way, the external transfer is real and OP has his coins.
