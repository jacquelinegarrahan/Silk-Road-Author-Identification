				I&#039;ve installed Liberte onto my external hard drive, so I can now boot any of my laptops from it and have an instant secure-browsing setup. Quite satisfied. I also have a complete backup of each of my laptops on the hard drive (it&#039;s a 1tb from western digital), so it&#039;s like a computer I can stick in my pocket--plug it in to any pc and boot it up and I&#039;ve got my whole computer right there. So pleased.<br /><br />However, I&#039;d love to find a way to run bitcoin from it--I don&#039;t trust e-wallets one bit after reviewing the history of bitcoin, I&#039;d like to have my bitcoins safe and sound on my computer where I can be responsible for ensuring that they are not stolen or compromised. Is there a way to run bitcoin on Liberte? If not, there should be, or some equivalent. In fact, I&#039;d love to see a bundle issued consisting of liberte pre-loaded with bitcoin.<br /><br />Any thoughts on the matter? Perhaps someone can explain what the compatibility issue is?

				there is no bitcoin valet or client on LIberte and never will be. there is many reasons for it, one is that bitcoins network is IP based network and LIberte is TOR based OS.
