				I&#039;m depositing cash at the bank anonymously.<br /><br />Is it possible to give them my SR address number so it can go directly there?<br /><br />And if so then why do people mess around with putting it in an instawallet?

				Where is the money you are depositing at the bank going?<br /><br />Are you talking about something like Virtex where you deposit at the RBC so it credits your Virtex account?<br /><br />Either way, I cannot think of any way, in any shape or form, how the bank could move your money directly to SR.<br /><br />And even if they could, you should never even think about doing it.<br /><br />Get your money into whatever exchange you are using.&nbsp; Then transfer them to your own Bitcoin wallet.&nbsp; Then, if you are paranoid like me, transfer them to another wallet on another machine, with an encrypted drive, with the wallet running over Tor, then transfer them to your SR wallet.<br /><br />If something ever happens, you can then just securely wipe the second machine that has the wallet on it (make sure there are no bitcoins in it first of course).<br />

				To clarify, I&#039;m anonymously depositing cash at the branch into the account of the bitcoin vendor.<br /><br />The bitcoin vender requires a address in which to deposit the coins. Can I and should I just give them my SR address?

				OK.&nbsp; That makes things a little clearer.&nbsp; No, don&#039;t give them your SR address.&nbsp; You want to minimize any traces you can.<br /><br />Go to &#039;bitcoin.org&#039; and download the wallet from the right hand side (they have them for Windows and Linux). <br /><br />Once you have it downloaded, go ahead and install it.&nbsp; The software is easy to use.&nbsp; You will need to leave it running for a few hours so that it can download all the coin blocks up to the current day.&nbsp; Once the number of blocks are up to date just ask it for a new deposit address, copy it, print it out, then send it to your exchange.<br /><br />They will send the bitcoins to your wallet.&nbsp; THEN you can send it to SR.&nbsp; If you want to be extra careful, install a wallet on a second machine (or VM) and send the BTC to that wallet and from that wallet to SR.<br /><br />You can also configure the wallet to work over Tor if you want, just google it and you should find instructions.<br /><br />But, never send your BTC directly to SR from anywhere you might be traced to.&nbsp; And do not be surprised if the bank asks you for ID.&nbsp; They started doing that up in Canada, you cannot just give them a fake name, they ask for picture ID.
