				Cash over the counter is the best way to prevent account freezing, charge backs etc. to the guys that deal out bitcoins.<br />Its also a lot harder for any purchases to be traced back to you. (Bank cameras and handwriting the only immediate ways for LE to link you to the bitcoins).<br />Remember, possessing or purchasing bitcoins is not illegal.<br /><br />I personally have never used it but I think I heard a few weeks ago that bitpiggy was back online and they accept bank transfers.<br />However, if you do decide to go the cash-over-counter method I would recommend spendbitcoins for speed, service and ease or if you have time to learn something new and want better rates go for cryptoxchange.<br /><br />Good luck, stay safe and shoot me a pm if you need anything :) (the less new Aus threads, the better)<br />

				The email should come pretty quickly (before you go to the bank) but even if it doesn&#039;t that&#039;s not a big deal. Soon as you fill in the initial purchase box with your email, BC deposit address etc you should see a new page with all the different bank&#039;s BSB and Acc numbers. On the left hand side of the page, if i remember correctly, will be your reference number. As soon as you have your reference number you&#039;re ready to head off to whichever bank you select and deposit the cash. Remember to give the teller the reference number as well and get a receipt of your deposit. Go home and email a copy of the receipt to Jeremy and you&#039;re done. I actually used spendbitcoins recently and the money was in my account a couple hours later, Jeremy is very efficient. I suppose the only downside to his company is the inflated BC rate. If you deposit 500, you&#039;ll probably end up with around 460-470 in your SR account.<br /><br />Honestly, spendbitcoins is very easy to use, and just to reiterate if the above sounded confusing;<br /><br />1. Make a quote on the home page<br />2. You should get a reference number instantly<br />3. Deposit cash at the bank of your choice<br />4. Go home and scan the receipt the teller gave you and email it back to Jeremy<br />5. Wait couple hours and you&#039;re ready to go.<br /><br />easy as pie

Which means that if you deposit $500, you&#039;re actually getting $450. Whatever extra you are getting is due to the exchange rate between US and Australia and Bitcoins.

I suppose the only downside is the fact you have to add 10% on top of the prices listed&nbsp; :(

				I agree with the Spend Bitcoins recommendation. Super fast and always efficient. Personally though, I&#039;m not buying Bitcoins again until the exchange rate lowers. I was happy when it rose to $10+ a coin after my last Bitcoin purchase at around $6 a coin! Wish I&#039;d bought more then!
