				I keep hearing about positive experiences using this service:<br />Fill out the junk on their site, print out a slip, walk into a participating bank and hand them the slip + cash, get Bitcoins within the hour.<br /><br />On their site, I dont quite get all the choices under Destination. Instead of allowing a BTC address as expected, you&#039;re forced to choose one of these 4:<br />CryptoXChange<br />Bitcoinica<br />MTGox<br />VirWox<br /><br />Aside from MTGox, I havent looked into what these other options are. But I thought the point of using bitinstant was that I could avoid having to register with services like MtGox. No? I still have to go sign up with one of these 4 services? The rumors about the Man monitoring MtGox was the whole point of why I was looking for an alternative method in the first place.<br /><br />What&#039;s the rumor mill about these other services and their anonymity/attention from LE?

				well the point of bitinstant, at least in my research is that you can easily and quickly deposit cash into one of those 4 destinatons. they do not purchase the btc, this is something you must do. they merely provide the opportunity to deposit anonymously instead of beling linked to a bank acct or whatever. they also take a little less than 4%, and it doesn&#039;t seem to be too complicated to buy/sell on mtgox. and im not sure of &#039;the man&#039; rumors or whatever but always interested to hear whats going on. its my understanding that a few btc tumbles through various wallets before entering SR is good enough.&nbsp; why should anyone go after a lowly end customer right? right??

				All 4 options are exchanges.&nbsp; Bitinstant puts the money in the account of your choosing to buy coins.&nbsp; I use Cryptoxchange personally.&nbsp; You can create a garbage account and withdrawal from it 5 times before they require ID.&nbsp; Then repeat.&nbsp; With cash deposits at banks, my name never gets involved in the paper trail at any point.&nbsp; I have no idea about the LE situation, but Mt Gox controls the majority of transactions so I would assume they&#039;d be the most likely to get monitored.

				Bitinstant is really nothing more than a service to move money.&nbsp; You tell them where to get the money (for instance Dwolla) and then give them the destination to the exhange service you use.&nbsp; Currently they only work with those four Exchange Services (CryptoXChange, Bitcoinica, MTGox<br />and VirWox).<br /><br />So they basically withdraw the funds from your source (using my example Dwolla) and deposit the funds into your exchange service.&nbsp; Once the funds are in the exchange service you can purchase your Bitcoins.&nbsp; Once you purchase your Bitcoins you can then move them to SR usually through a mixer such as Bitcoinfog.&nbsp;

				Which one of these four exchangers do you guys prefer? I won&#039;t touch Mt. Gox unless necessary because they are known to flag tor users and worse. CryptoXchange seems promising, but are they as &quot;hot&quot; as Mt. Gox?

				I use CryptoXchange and then send the money through Bitcoinfog.&nbsp; Remember that Bitcoinfog requires a minimum of six hours to mix your coins.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably unnecessary for small time buyers but, I like the feeling of security.&nbsp; SL is supposed to also mix the coins prior to entering the Road but, I don&#039;t know how well it can be done in twenty minutes or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />
