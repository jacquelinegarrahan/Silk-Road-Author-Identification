				I don&#039;t have the technical knowledge to explain to you why, but from what I understand, since phones are so easy to trace, it is generally discouraged to use it as a connection to SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure someone else will have a better answer than me, but I&#039;d err on the side of caution and make your orders on a public network somewhere.

				The Tor network should work fine. The only problem is, that the data is going wireless to your provider and can be read by people with proper equipment. But I don&#039;t think that they could actually see that you use SR.

				Do you mean you are tethering your 4G connection from your iphone and using that to acess SR on a computer?<br /><br />If that&#039;s the case, I wouldn&#039;t worry as much about being hacked as having your identity compromised. Your iphone knows exactly who you are and has a GPS that know exactly where you are. <br /><br />Sounds risky to me, I think you&#039;d be much safer using a public wifi
