				People here talk about obtaining PO Boxes with fake ID&#039;s. What about a whole separate, anonymous residence? I&#039;ve heard of it being done but I&#039;ve never actually tried, and I&#039;m not really sure how it could be done safely/securely. Thoughts on this? Is it doable/not doable?

A unit means an industrial or storage space. If you are buying in weight and it&#039;s coming in packages you are much better off sending it there because you can use an industrial space as a better cover. If you think about it logically if you get a unit meant for manufacturing or something like that you have a much more valid reason to be importing lots of different things on a regular basis so by default you have all sorts of options for shipping too. A unit doesn&#039;t have to be a full-blown warehouse either, workshop-sized ones are just as good. :) You are better off getting one with running water/gas as well as electricity as well, if you need to dispose of things quickly then plumbing systems leading to sewers are most definitely your ally in those situations.&nbsp; ;)

				The real gold sticker that a unit gives you over a residential lease as well is about timings and immediate surroundings. When you have an apartment or house then you have to deal with people like neighbors who will find it suspicious if you aren&#039;t living there and just turn up maybe once a week to receive mail so you have to worry about a whole other layer of deception. When you got a unit you that isn&#039;t a core issue because nobody expects you to be there 24/7 and small business working hours can be erratic if you gotta fill orders to deadlines. Makes receiving packages at odd hours, going in an our at odd times and not being there all the time a lot easier to make viable.

				that may be a fairly large over head cost.&nbsp; i guess if land lord can run a good social which match your id, this option won&#039;t be too bad.&nbsp; of course you must consider neighbors, i would get a run down apt, in a fairly poor area, somewhat secluded... you may be in business for a short while at least. and depending on what your getting in, that may be all you need.<br /><br />option 2 i been pondering on bulk.<br /><br />think about going down to the post office, bright and early, then going where the mail car goes.&nbsp; this tactic is VERY anonymous, and imo the best tactic available for remaining unseen, however it involves the most leg work.&nbsp; such as, profiling proper neighborhoods, neighbors, and studying work schedules and behaviors.<br /><br />if you study the same route for lets say 2 weeks, know the mail person, and delivery drop point..&nbsp; you can effectively -on one of your profiling days, grab a piece of&nbsp; mail, and walk away after noting the names and addresses. <br /><br />you get the mail bright and early, maybe everyone is still sleep.. plus this is one of the first mail deliveries which get delivered for the day so you shouldn&#039;t expect mail delay&#039;s or hangups.&nbsp; now imagine if you had more then a few drops of this nature...<br /><br />that little bit of leg work, allows you to be completely anonymous.. without fear of getting 5 pounds of coke delivered to you from columbia; because you studied the mail delivery person, and you know it&#039;s not a cd.

				Having your bulk drugs delivered to somebody elses house then hoping to steal it before they get at it is the worst idea ever. I see a limitless propagation and probability of errors from this.<br /><br />Having your drugs delivered to a business unit is risky, because often they won&#039;t drop at a business and will make you go pick it up somewhere. Cops suspicious of business entities have a million reasons they can search your place, like some BS city ordinance inspection. They can&#039;t do that to a residential home they need warrants. Still this is infinitely better than a bullshit house drop and trying to steal it unnoticed. <br /><br />If a house is vacant, often the post guy/girl will kill it and return to sender. 50/50 chance either somebody sees you and calls cops, or postman kills it, or realtor shows up with people to look at the place and asks you wtf u doin?<br /><br />Having it delivered to a virtual office where they already get a ton of mail, and a secretary signs for everything and forwards it to you domestically wherever you want is much easier. Obviously if full of drugs and caught by customs they will slap a GPS on it and follow you after you pick it up. <br /><br />As for getting an anonymous apartment you simply cruise craigslist for people looking for roommates, or foreign students looking for a lease takeover. Often kids will sign a year long lease, study for 6mos and then go back to Japan/China/Europe, and try to find somebody for a takeover. I successfully took over numerous apartments this way with fake ID. Everybody should be vac sealing and preparing drugs in a separate residence or unit not in your name. <br /><br />One problem is the roommate may become suspicious and open the package, or they may steal it and claim it never arrived like some guy who said that happened to him here ages ago. They can also be witnesses in court testifying how many packages they saw you receive over time. Prob should avoid this. <br />

				&nbsp;its up to the people who rent out the house, they could use ur ssn for a backround/credit check tho.&nbsp; ive heard of people just using a fake id to stay at an extend long period stay hotel and have it sent there over night to the room and have someone pick up the package later. Also try corporate long term rentals that people use to stay for work bussiness and are operated by a shell business that you can falsify that you work for...

Or move from your existing place, change your license and address information but keep the old place paying cash for rent. Could also register a company and get rent in an artist building full of workshops or a business unit, since it could be noisy running a vac sealer all the time in some guy&#039;s basement suite. Can set up a business entity not at all connected to you. <br /><br />

				If you were to go to some sources that are floating around, you can get government issued ID&#039;s and SSN # w/ card that are eligible for even government identification. I am confident, you would have no issues and securely renting an apt/unit/etc other than the fact your identity won&#039;t have any credit (although many are very lenient these days).

				1. Proof of employment<br />2. SSN<br />3. I.D<br />4. Personal and professional references<br />5. Credit Check(depending on how shitty the apartment is)<br /><br />It takes a lot of leg work to rent an apartment. It just depends if you have all your papers/references and friends who&#039;ll vouch for you).<br /><br />If an apartment manager requires a credit check just walk away because when he pulls your credit file your job won&#039;t line up. If you choose to live in a less than desirable neighborhood credit checks are pretty much non existant. All you have to do is buy a burner phone and get a friend or anyone you know to answer the phone as a business(hell you could find the least messed up wino, pay him with a bottle of whiskey to receive the call and act as your boss.&nbsp; <br /><br />Or if you live close to a college, sign up for 1 course, show your landlord and drop the course if you want
