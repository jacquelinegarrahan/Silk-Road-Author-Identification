				I&#039;m not normally a paranoid person, but a seed has been planted about one of my recent contacts.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just a bunch of red flags.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My communication has been via a &quot;on-the-go&quot; phone registered under a fake name &amp; address.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m planning on ditching this phone &amp; number asap, but I&#039;m just wondering what tools LE has to track me down and how paranoid I should be.<br /><br />Thanks for any advice.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)

				Thanks Guru, I had read that article before and re-read it again just now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My paranoia is going away, it&#039;s an awful feeling and I&#039;m just going to stop worrying.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m just going to go with the assumption that he is LE and has hacked my phone to turn it into a microphone (can this really be done by joe-shmoe narc officer?) and just ditch the phone asap.&nbsp;

				If I were you, I&#039;d destroy that phone and lay low for a while.&nbsp; Clean your house and wipe your hard drive.&nbsp; To wipe your HDD clean, download and run DBAN.<br /><br />They may be building a case on you to either go after you or go after your supplier if they think there is a bigger fish to be caught.

				Thanks for taking the time to respond Guru, very much appreciated!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they would go after a guy like me but like you said, you never know.&nbsp; &nbsp; The transaction history stuff has me thinking I may have to cut off my current clients and just get new ones every few months.&nbsp; &nbsp;Better safe than sorry.&nbsp; <br /><br />My cheap ass &#039;on-the-go&#039; phone has a freakin GPS!&nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s out of my control at this point so I&#039;m not going to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;The phone is gone and they either have something or nothing, can&#039;t let this rule my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m going to be optimistic rather than paranoid and assume I&#039;m off their radar.

				Yoooo. if that phone has GPS your fucked.. only if there watching you tho.. i would recommend going and getting the cheapy no gps bottom shelf pay as you go... those normally dont have gps.. you want to stay away from the smartphones!!!<br /><br />in reagrds to guru thinking that cell phones are the most watched technology i&#039;d have to disagree..... my nomination would go to e-mail for that...<br /><br />ohh.. one more thing.. always trust your gut... it knows best i dont know how or why but my gut has never let me down...<br /><br />hope this helps.. and dont forget.. get rid of gps capable phones for business.. you dont need all the bells and whistles to make calls and send txts..<br /><br />Hope this helps

				I&#039;m just being blunt.. if your right and LE is watching you and your phone and they have a warrant then not only will they know where you are weather or not the phone is on but they will also know everywhere you have been...<br /><br />I like using the LG keybo phones.. they never let me or anyone I know down.. <br /><br />I think this whole GPS craze is BS.. i dont even have one in my car becaus it also keeps track of everywhere me and my car has been...<br /><br />also if your super paro and you want to use a phone.. try using a &quot;ghost line&quot; this is different from a dump phones.. ghost lines are stolen real lines of real subscribers.. when you use the phone it registers as if the one holding the real phone (not the copy) is using it...<br /><br />they are hard to find but well worth the extra money... imagine using a phone and it registers as a call made but registers it from another country!<br /><br />anywho.. did not mean to be blunt but I&#039;m sure you dont want people to sugar coat this.
