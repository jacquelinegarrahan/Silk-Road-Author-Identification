				Title: <strong>Question about SR coin tumbling...</strong><br />

				Say a person has two or more SR accounts.&nbsp; If one of your accounts had 10 BTC&#039;s in it and you sent those coins to another one of your SR accounts via BTC address, Does Silk Road tumble those transactions?&nbsp; How about if you were to use the member to member SR function to exchange the coins?&nbsp; My question is... would transferring your money to another account and then back, would that effectively tumble or obfuscate your bitcoins?&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.

				I can still see the transfer on blockchain.info/ when I send it to my other bitcoin account, but I&#039;ve never tried what you&#039;re asking. I&#039;d like to know too.

				You don&#039;t tumble &quot;transactions&quot;. Transactions are simply point A to point B. AKA BTC address A to BTC address B.<br /><br />Tumbling is done on coins in a wallet. I&#039;m not sure why you would need to perform any of the steps you&#039;ve described. If anything, you would want to send coins to a non-silk road BTC address or tumbling service (optimal you would have done this before sending coins to SR in the first place) and back again. Use the SR function that gives you a new BTC address after every transaction you make completes.

				I understand that you dont tumble transactions.&nbsp; My question is does Silk Road&#039;s built-in tumbler tumble coins that are transferred from one SR account to another, like it does when you purchase from a vendor and transfer your coin to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to stay away from using services like bitcoinfog that are not backed up by any guarantee

				I believe the coins are tumbled as soon as you deposit them in your account. There is no need to send them to another SR account to tumble. You can just deposit some coins in your SR account - wait a few days and then send them to a bitcoin wallet outside of SR - you wont get the same coins back.
