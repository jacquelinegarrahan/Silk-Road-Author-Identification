				I see, can this possibly take more than 24hrs for the seller to receive after you have sent to an address given ?

				The actual bitcoin transfer won&#039;t take 24 hours, it should be 6 to 10 confirmations which is 40-60mins tops.

				Double check the address and make sure it matches.&nbsp; If it does then the vendor is doing something wrong.&nbsp; If they match but the vendor realizes we sent you an invalid address the funds should turn up in tradehill.&nbsp; If the address is invalid, let TH know as they may have to search for the rejected transfer.

				Well i withdrawed it to the sellers address, im more than positive that it was sent to the correct address they gave to me. I will surely let TH know if the status remain the same as i am awaiting for another respond from seller. Well it marked as successful. And were can you see the address you sent it to?&nbsp; &nbsp;It just says &quot;BTC via Bitcoin Transfer to Your Bitcoin Address&quot; And thats its complete.&nbsp; &nbsp; I also recently sent out another amount, and the last one that was successful, which is the one i sent yesterday is now gone from the pending deposits and withdraws in the dashboard.&nbsp; Any help?
