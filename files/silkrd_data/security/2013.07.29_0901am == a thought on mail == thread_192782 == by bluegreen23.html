				So I was watching a video on customs and packages. Some things I&#039;ve noticed <br />1) letter mail wasn&#039;t examined on the video<br /><br />this leads me to believe that if it&#039;s a letter then it most likely flies through automated type machines and is probably not closely searched unless something hits as a positive or suspicious (address scan?).<br /><br />2) packages are handled and often given some kind of check<br /><br />by this I mean they are visually inspected. Not one by one, carefully scrutinized. But they are looked over as they pass by or as they are loaded into the correct bag etcetc<br /><br />3) There was a gap in the video that didn&#039;t clarify the address and computer scanning portion of the mail process so I&#039;m unclear but my impression was that addresses are scanned in and can be flagged. <br /><br /><br />With all this in mind I was wondering a few things... well mostly one thing.<br /><br />There are enough weed vendors all over to start &quot;mail bombing&quot; there local blue boxes. This is relatively simple idea that just a little shake will contaminate not only the mail currently in the box but also the box itself (hopefully it will linger on thus contaminating future pieces of mail)<br />Of course this will cause a great deal of mail to give positives, most of it being legit mail. Of course as this contaminated mail moves into mail centers for processing it would continue to contaminate other pieces of mail, perhaps mail handlers bags, maybe with enough contamination mail vehicles and so on. The end goal of course being to cause a general contamination that will make dogs, and perhaps even computer detectors give false positives. <br />This would result in <br />1) massive delays requiring the mail system to figure something else out (they can&#039;t search 25000 pieces of contaminated mail and they can&#039;t hold it while more continues to arrive and generate positives) <br />2) dogs being confused and no longer being of use until everything was &quot;clean&quot;<br />3) If this was large scale enough I&#039;m sure it could cause the system to adapt but in the meantime it would force the authorities to simply let mail past. Especially if it was a continuous contamination. <br /><br />Shake is next to worthless to most growers and it has the ability to cause a dog to alert on the wrong thing. a few letters that were thrown in a bag of shake for a few days would do and would most likely contaminate everything they touched. On top of that a handful of shake tossed into boxes would do a fair amount as well, even after the larger leaves and what not were physically removed. For the truly bold a handful of shake tossed into a parked postal truck would do a ridiculous amount of &quot;damage&quot; and could continue to do so on an on going basis. <br /><br />At any rate it was just a thought.

				Corrupting the postal service in any way will lead to federal charges. In your example it&#039;s even worse and would lead to terrorism charges. Guaranteed.<br /><br />I guess that&#039;s why no one replied to your post. They don&#039;t want to encourage you&nbsp; ;)

				While such an idea might seem fancy, the last thing we need is an even further increase in the postal system security through the implementation of some new technology. Lets be happy with the shit security that they have.

In time, I&#039;m sure they (the feds) will begin to draw attention to the pitiful state of out national parcel service and how it facilitates the work of insidious criminal circles which sell innocent children bath salts and disguised cyanide capsules... Then we&#039;ll be stuck with police state levels of snooping or worse: privatized parcel companies contracted by the gov to replace the public entities entirely...<br /><br />Let&#039;s be thankful for the USPS in it&#039;s current state!<br /><br /><br />Interesting ideas though, bluegreen23. I like the various possibilities of total mayhem that could result if this were to cascade into a nationwide thing.

Because a group that decided to do this would wait around to get caught, or put their own names and addresses on packages so they could be tracked down and charged. If I had concerns over people getting caught and charged I wouldn&#039;t have suggested it. I mean come on. Talking about 200+ people walking by blue boxes and dropping a handful of shake in with their envelope. None the less. Noted for consideration.

				I guess you missed the memo that most western countries are either already police states or quickly becoming them. The mail system is the final frontier. Believe me when I say that there are PLENTY of people in government, and corrupt corporations tied to government, that would LOVE to bilk taxpayers out of tens of billions of dollars to bring the police state to postal. Anyone who contaminated the system like what you&#039;ve talked about would be doing these fucks a huge favor. I agree with one poster here that it would be cool to watch government asswipes sweat while this were going on but in the end we&#039;d all be fucked.<br /><br />It would be like another 9/11 on postal. Can you imagine it? &quot;Terrorism&quot;! &quot;The Children&quot;! &quot;Drugs&quot;! And infinite power to the police and government. Not a good thought AT ALL. On the other hand I&#039;m sure Dick Cheney and a bunch of retired generals and police chiefs would love it&nbsp; ;)
