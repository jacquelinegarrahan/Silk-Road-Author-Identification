				I&#039;ll be travelling next week and I was thinking of taking a few nbome blotters with me, maybe 4 blotters that are separate (not attached together).<br /><br />I definitely won&#039;t let them go through x-ray machine, as the tiny geometry pattern will be easily spotted.<br /><br />So I was thinking of carrying them with me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They&#039;re currently wrapped in tinfoil, so I guess tinfoil is a no go with metal detectors, is that correct?<br /><br />I am accepting suggestions as to how to carry them in my body, without losing their properties.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to South America, with a connection in the US.&nbsp; <br />So my bigggest concern is the TSA (x-ray machines and/or pat downs).&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried at all with entering South America, as I know the terrain.<br /><br />Thank you very much.

				I don&#039;t have the balls to take any sorts of drugs to the airport after having a close encounter with a few thousand valium tabs and xanax&#039;s a while back lol<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if this will help you but, If I was in your position I would wrap them in paper, lift up sole underneath trainers and place there...can&#039;t see how anyone would find that or show up on any electronic system...it&#039;s just paper right?

				Purse/wallet .. store it like a card. It is just a piece of paper after all.<br /><br />If it is really a big deal then keep it in your pocket. It isn&#039;t metal so just make sure you have nothing metal in that pocket, so when it comes time to take everything out of your pockets you don&#039;t even have to reach into that pocket.<br /><br />However, aluminum foil is a bad idea imho. It stands out and looks suspicious. Take a regular piece of printer paper, fold it up into a square, put the LSD in that, then put it in your pocket.

				Be creative ! Make an art piece! Do a collage.... <br />Wrap your tabs in some plastic wrap and stick various pieces of magazine over it. Do this everywhere on a A4 sheet with different thickness of paper so that there is not only one part with a bump caused by the hidden tabs ... <br /><br />Google: Collage Art<br /><br />Hope that helps !

				The safest way to get your blotters to destination is mail them in envelope to your destination adress prior the trip to south America. I would never bring any drugs with me on the plane, unless I want to be high while flying :D

				Proud accomplishment of mine: Bringing a quad of mushrooms on the plane with me to Cancun :) Even went through that new &quot;puffer&quot; machine thing, that allegedly sees through to your underwear.<br /><br />Just wore some underarmour with a cup holder, put the mushies in a ziplock, and put it under my balls.<br /><br />My new method is a lot safer and more ingenious, though :)<br /><br />Now that I think about it, that way would be PERFECT for mailing quantities of shrooms for SR vendors....

				I wouldn&#039;t advise the metal.... but what I can tell you is that I moved to a new state recently and flew by plane strapped with 10 pills of OxyContin, 3 pills of ecstasy, 3 Xanax, 15 Percocet, and 4 Suboxone strips. All conveniently placed in a plastic baggy in the special compartment of the underwear I had made. Walked right on to the plane with the pills in my underwear. Once on the plane, I went in the bathroom, took the baggie of drugs, placed it in my pocket and I was good to go. Getting through the initial security is the key.<br /><br /><br /><br />If I had had a random patdown, I probably would&#039;ve been fucked. I made it though... With all my drugs intact :)

				I thought I&#039;d let everyone in on a little trick I learned about recently.&nbsp; If you&#039;re flying with any illict material, put it in a jar peanut butter and put it in your checked luggage.&nbsp; The pb sets off the density scanners so TSA will open your luggage but can&#039;t open the pb.&nbsp; For even more security, carefully glue the lid in place so it looks even more unopened.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t suggest this for bulk amounts, but small quanities can be done easily... it might just look strange if you have a suitcase full of pb.&nbsp; I know people who do this all the time with small amounts of weed and have had no problem.

				The puffer you can get buy with strapping/taping stuff to the junk, but the body scanner is a different story.&nbsp; I had a pair of pants that had a normal front pocket and a hidden pocket next too it.&nbsp; While I was being scanned they checked the pocket because it &quot;looked funny&quot; on the scanner.&nbsp; Fortunately nothing on me....but if they see a tiny extra layer of cloth and investigate, I can only imagine what would have happened to me I had something on me.

				You cannot go thru the body scanner machine if you are carrying drugs on you.&nbsp; &nbsp;CANNOT.&nbsp; &nbsp;It sees everything....everything.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only way to beat it would be to stuff it up your ass or ingest what are trying to smuggle to come out later.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can opt out of the scanner but BE PREPARED for a much more thorough pat down.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck those scanners.....I would never go thru one just on Principle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Know your rights....don&#039;t let them just lead you like sheep in the name of security.

				The full body x-ray scanners are bull shit. A complete piss on the constitution.<br /><br />I once overheard an airport employee say to another, &quot;Ok, it&#039;s time to pick someone&quot;<br /><br />People are &quot;randomly&quot; selected in the sense that the frequency of which people are selected may be random but there is nothing random about who is picked to go through the scanner. <br /><br />

				I think your best bet would be to just put them in your wallet. The xray machine picks up different densities, it is not sensitive enough to pick up the pattern in your wallet behind your license, credit cards, and money.

Is this an idea of a joke? PB is the same density as toothpaste. Can you take tooth paste on the pane? Hell no. No liquified product of ANY kind over 3 ounces. They will take your jar of PB is what they will do. <br />I agree with mailing it. <br />But I can tell you that a lighter, and some aluminum won&#039;t set off a metal detector. At least not the ones I walked through. In Oct of 2002, I went into the Philly Airport at 1am, walked past ALL metal detectors, up the escalator, past all the closed security check points, and fell asleep on the chairs in the terminal. No other humans until 7am. Good thing I am not a terrorist.....oh wait....I smoke pot, I support terror. <br />Last time I flew was 2002, though. I prefer to drive, now. Forever.

				Dimitri, the pb thing only works if it is in your CHECKED luggage.&nbsp; Of course you would never be able to take that much pb on your carry-on, you might have a bomb in it or something same with toothpaste haha.&nbsp; But in complete seriousness, TSA is not authorized to open anything within your bag besides the bag itself of course.

				If it were me, I&#039;d put the syd in a plastic dime/jewelery bag, and then put that in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans. Then I&#039;d pack the jeans and check the suitcase. <br /><br />Also, I have a friend who always travels dirty on domestic flights and he does the following:<br />Buy a new stick of deodorant (solid), open it up all the way and take out the deodorant portion. Next, break a chunk off the bottom of the deodorant. Now, place your drugs in the bottom of the empty container and then put the top half the deodorant back on top of it. So that if it were opened by someone they would just see the top deodorant.&nbsp; Deodorant goes in checked luggage&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />
