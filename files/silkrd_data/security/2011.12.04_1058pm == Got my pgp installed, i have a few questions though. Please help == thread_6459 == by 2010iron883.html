				Kleopatra is the GUI of PGP.&nbsp; You work within her (pun intended ;)<br /><br />So open up Kleopatra File -&gt; New Certificate<br />Enter whatever for name/email<br />Enter cryptic passpharse<br />Chose the Paired PGP Keys <br />Then create a backup of your PRIV &amp; PUB key if you like<br />Click Finish<br />Then viola Cert created.&nbsp; Right click it -&gt; Export Certificate to get your PUBLIC PGP Key<br /><br />This is too long to explain actually..you know it comes with documentation for a reason. <br />That&#039;s how I learned.

Bitcoin is untraceable moved around in tor, how much more security does a buyer need? All these extra wallets take time to set up and run -and really, provide nothing more than a false sense of security (cos you ultimately end up on SR no matter now fancy you network your bitcoin, so just go there already!) I&#039;m staking my freedom on it.<br /><br />GPG4WIN is a pain! The thing is, you need to run a &#039;regular&#039; mail client on it, and there&#039;s the weakest link! Another ridiculous nonsense that nobody has actually thought through! It&#039;s kind of like waving a bazooka around that fires invisible rockets thinking LE won&#039;t notice the bazooka!<br /><br />It was not designed for &#039;undesirable&#039; elements like us!<br /><br />Tormail is just brilliant. It&#039;s in a cloud, it can&#039;t be traced or shut down, the webmasters tell LE and anyone else who wants info that they can stick it where the sun don&#039;t shine! It&#039;s anonymous, and leaves no cookies or other traces on your system when logged out. You might need encryption for SOME emails to vendors, but again it only seems to be the address, what else could you say in a SR deal that a) would give LE any worthwhile info they don&#039;t already know about SR already? b)trace tormail back to you?<br /><br />I use cloud based tormail.net and I&#039;m looking at PGP from arcticsoft, 15 day free trial, if that sucks like GPG4WIN, i&#039;ll keep GPG and only encrypt if the vendor insists. You&#039;re right, its a fuckin mission to run this shit! Again, the benefits seem dubious for the drama involved and the fact that we openly discuss lawbreaking here but encrypt emails on the minutiae of tiny deals, it would be hilarious if it wasn&#039;t so lame.<br /><br />I have physical addresses that don&#039;t lead back to me anyway...<br />

				I get the sense that some people are not aware of the clipboard function in GPA, which comes with Gpg4win. I think you&#039;ll find that it&#039;s pretty easy to use.
