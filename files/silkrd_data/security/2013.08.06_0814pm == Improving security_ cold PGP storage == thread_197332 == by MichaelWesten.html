				Is there a feasible way to have your PGP stored securely on a cold (i.e. never connected to the internet) device, whether it be computer, rooted smart phone or similar handheld device, hell even a calculator if it can be programmed.&nbsp; If this is feasible, what way can you securely transfer the data from a hot computer where you receive the original message.&nbsp; I have tried painstakingly typing out the whole code but that is INCREDIBLY inefficient.&nbsp; Basically, I want to receive all communications encrypted, transfer them to a computer that is not hackable (does not communicate with any other devices much less the internet).&nbsp; Can one of you security whiz guys tell me how I can make this happen, and whether it actually provides the significant security upgrade I perceive (making your messages completely unreadable even if the hot computer was keylogged or ghosted).

				It seems like any cheap netbook or something similar would work, just disable any communcation devices such as bluetooth, wifi, etc. The main thing I guess would be getting the encrypted message over to the island computer. Maybe USB stick though that might not be the most secure. Maybe there is software that would put the encrypted message as a QR code or series of QR codes that could be scanned by the island computer?

				Take all the PGP messages store them in a .txt file then transfer it via flashdrive or some other local method. Avoid online methods and stick to someting local that can be destroyed with ease. <br /><br />Most flash drives are so small you could swallow them if you needed too. I could swallow like 4 of the ones I use with a nice gulp of water. It would be extremely unpleasant but I like having that flexibility if I needed to get rid of something fast and destroying it was not an option.

				I&#039;d like to add that I would personally try to limit the devices I use for illegal activity.
