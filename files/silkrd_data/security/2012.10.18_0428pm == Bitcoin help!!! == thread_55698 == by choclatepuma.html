				Hi sorry if this has been answered, Ive looked and looked but cant seem to find any sources. If there has please post the link to the appropriate help. <br /><br />Ive bought 7 bitcoins the first time i deposited them in &#039;Tor Wallet&#039; in which i got scammed. Im about to buy another 7 (if anyone in UK is struggling to find a reliable source, pm me and i will direct you to the right place)and&nbsp; i was just wondering when i get theses 7 they get deposited into the wallet that, that website provides. If i use that website on TOR can i then deposit it straight into silk road account or do i need to deposit them into a different wallet, and then into silk road! as ive heard bad things about instawallet (friend got scammed 300BTC) from there. If anyone could help it would be great. Cheers :D

				Have you identified yourself when buying your bitcoins? If you have, I&#039;d say it&#039;s a bad idea to transfer them directly to your SR wallet without using a mixing service first. If you have not (the purchase was anonymous and you&#039;ve only accessed the wallet via TOR) it should be safe to transfer them directly into the SR wallet, but personally I mix them in spite of buying them anonymously to be extra safe.
