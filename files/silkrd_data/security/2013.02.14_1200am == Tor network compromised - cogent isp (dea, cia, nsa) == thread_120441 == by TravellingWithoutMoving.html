				h__p://anonymos.earthsociety.org/wordpress/2012/08/warning-tor-network-is-compromised/<br /><br />&quot;Warning TOR network is compromised<br /><br />Up until now my OS has attempted to provide secure communication via the TOR network. However, recent discoveries have led me to the conclusion that the TOR network is highly compromised. I’m posting this as a warning to those who depend on the TOR network for security. It is not secure. I have suspected this for a long time now for various reasons but am now quite sure.<br /><br />Cogent communications is an ISP, which I believe was formed by one or more agencies of the US government i.e. Navel Intelligence, CIA, DIA, or NSA. This company operates a vast number of TOR servers and in combination with other fronts, I believe they control enough servers to enable these agencies to track to origin any network request they desire.<br /><br />The TOR software is good, I am making no claim that it is compromised. Rather, the network itself has been.<br /><br />If I am correct, then those using the hidden TOR service called ‘the silk road’, should be aware that they are likely being tracked and databased. However, the silk road is no more a honeypot than the whole of TOR is a honeypot.<br /><br />An important aspect of TOR is that the software is by default not a server/router. This means that most people are endpoints and the routing itself is done by big players. The I2P network software, on the other hand, acts as a server by default greatly increasing the network security.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you seek security, you should abandon using TOR immediately.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />discovered sorry if info already posted<br /><br />Peace<br />TWM

				And, dude, research on the TOR project was actually funded by the US govt. The Internet itself is born in the US military. Does that mean that every damned thing is compromised ? Because it seems to me that those crackdown on TOR child porn rings are waiting their sweet time to happen... Or maybe you think the US gov (or any other) think that keeping their cover to bust less that 1% of drug dealers / users in the country / world, or Assange&#039; servers is worth more than child traffickers and the destroyed lives of hundred of children ? US children included ? <br /><br />That would make another good book a few years down the road.

				Okay here is my take on this. First of all, I have no idea about that ISP or the percentage of Tor nodes that are hosted by them. It seems that they are a big ISP, so they probably do carry a lot of Tor traffic. As to the claim that the NSA or CIA owns them, well who knows. Nobody really thinks that Tor will keep them anonymous from the NSA anyway. They have Narusinsight super computers at many major IX&#039;s and they can passively monitor all Tor traffic that goes through the USA anyway. Even if they couldn&#039;t passively monitor huge portions of US internet traffic, they can hack into pretty much anything and they could by pass Tor to get to targets if they really wanted to. The CIA can by pass Tor to get to targets if they really want to. It is silly to think that the NSA would actively add nodes to the Tor network when they can already passively monitor traffic into and out of all Tor nodes in the USA. A single Narusinsight surveillance computer can completely monitor and record traffic from several thousand residential internet links in real time, and the NSA has at least half a dozen of these things at major internet hubs across the USA. Also, they don&#039;t monitor in real time but rather switch rapidly between connections (sampling), allowing them to gather enough traffic for correlation attacks against millions of internet connections. Monitoring the few thousand Tor nodes in USA is not going to be a problem for them. Passively monitoring enough Tor traffic to do massive damage against Tor is easy enough to do for IX level attackers without the need for them to add a single node to the network : http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/murdoch-pet2007.pdf (Sampled Traffic Analysis by Internet-Exchange-Level Adversaries)<br /><br />This makes his claim that the NSA may own these nodes to be dubious at best. The NSA doesn&#039;t need to own Tor nodes to break Tor anonymity. The other intelligence agencies he named may not have as much signals intelligence as the NSA, and may need to add their own nodes if they don&#039;t want to just hack their way past Tor. We have not got a lot to worry about intelligence agencies. Intelligence agencies actually do have bigger things to worry about than us. Some of them, like the NSA, are legally restricted from spying on US citizens unless they are in contact with terrorists or foreign intelligence agents. This does not mean that they respect the law, but it does mean that they rarely if ever bring their illegal activity to light by busting drug dealers. If he had any proof that the FBI or DEA owned that big ISP, I would be a little bit more worried. But he doesn&#039;t have proof that Cogent is a front for any agency, from NSA to your local police. He calls Tor TOR, which is usually a dead give away that somebody actually doesn&#039;t know that much about Tor. In academic articles it is called Tor, researchers studying it call it Tor, the media calls it TOR and usually people who call it TOR have learned everything they know about it from the media. <br /><br />He acts like I2P is superior to Tor. In reality, the NSA can monitor the US based I2P servers just as easily as they can monitor the US based Tor servers. I2P has a handful of its own issues as well. Down time correlations against hidden services can deanonymize them as soon as they have down time, and it is easy to get the list of all I2P routers and therefor users as well. It is a bit harder to do this attack than I once thought, as nodes are not immediately unlisted once they go down. However, an attacker can keep pinging every I2P node and wait for a hidden service to go down (or DDOS the hidden service) and see which node stops replying to pings when the hidden service goes down. I2P would be absolutely horrible for Silk Road entirely because of the fact that everybody is a router. Fifty thousand or so people use I2P currently, they are spread through out the world, and it is easy to get all of their IP addresses. Guess what happens now when some vendor in New York sends a drug package to the police? The police see all of the I2P routers in New York and they have already narrowed in on their target, if the target lives in a remote area the police can probably deanonymize him immediately after seeing where he ships from. <br /><br />In short, this guy is admittedly speculating, he has not given any real proof, he suggests using a network that is much worse than Tor for our specific threat model and imo in general, he thinks that NSA would actively attack Tor when in reality they would almost certainly passively attack it and he doesn&#039;t appear to have researched Tor much because he calls it TOR. I am not very worried from what he said, and I would chalk this up to FUD or possibly even worse considering he seems to suggest that Silk Road starts using I2P despite the fact that I2P would be the absolute worst choice for Silk Road users.

				I remember seeing a post on here a while back regarding an academic paper on Tor that theoretically proved that if a single group controlled 25%-30% of all of the Tor relays they could track traffic across the network. The best way to combat this is to get as many people as we can running relays. We don&#039;t necessarily need folks to run exit nodes, just lots of relays.

				Tor&#039;s fine. Lets take a look at Tor&#039;s own page on the issue.<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Because each relay sees no more than one hop in the circuit, neither an eavesdropper nor a compromised relay can use traffic analysis to link the connection&#039;s source and destination.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In other words, all a compromised server knows is that some other node on Tor asked it to relay some encrypted data (if a relay) or visit whichever site (if an exit relay). It has no way of knowing if it was your computer or any other node. <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s all encrypted (as illustrated as green arrows on tor&#039;s page) except potentially between the exit relay and final destination. This means that the actual data isn&#039;t accessible to any node, except potentially an exit relay communicating to a non-secure server. But this is fine, sense even if the exit relay knows what the data is, it can&#039;t identify you for the reasons described above.

If you think they are not extremely skilled, I strongly believe you are only fooling yourself. Additionally, Roger Dingledine, the lead developer of Tor, got his start working for the NSA in the first place. Second of all, Tor is not able to provide you anonymity if your entry node and exit node are compromised, there is no guessing involved on the part of the attacker, they are able to use packet timing characteristics to statistically prove that both parts of the traffic flow are related. Third of all, despite being correct in saying that Hidden Services do not use exit nodes, strictly speaking, they are still just as susceptible to end point timing correlation attacks as circuits exiting to the clearnet are. In such a case the attacker would need to own the hidden services entry node and the connecting clients entry node, incidentally this is possible for an attacker with a single node in the case of hidden services, but not in the case of connections to the clearnet where the attacker would need to own or be able to passively monitor at least two nodes. The hidden service does not necessarily need to be owned by the attacker, it merely needs to be identified by the attacker and put under passive surveillance, or under active surveillance in the case that the attacker manages to own one or more of the hidden services entry guards.

And believe me I know it, like any tool, must be used correctly in order to work. I know you get a lot of newbies who come staggering into these forums and blurting out mindless things based on ignorance, but I&#039;m not one of them. I actually read through the documentation to learn about Tor.<br /><br />What&#039;s important is to consider the threat model and to understand the *actual* vulnerabilities of the security measures we use to guard our privacy/anonymity, not simply credit the adversary with the means to defeat it with secret methods that aren&#039;t even described. When it comes down to it, if they really want to know your secrets they will beat it out of you (but you&#039;ve gotta already be a &#039;person of interest&#039; for it to get to that point).<br /><br />What I&#039;ve leaned is Tor is safe as long as you use the Tor browser to access .onion sites (aka &quot;hidden services&quot;) within the Tor network and keep your private information private. Every published paper I&#039;ve read on global network monitoring and such has to do with activity at the edges - traffic into and out of the Tor network, which happens when people use Tor to access clearnet sites. Clearnet browsing IS a big risk to anonymity because your IP&#039;s traffic can be correlated with traffic leaving Tor network (often unencrypted).The connection goes something like this:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (exit node) &lt;---&gt; website<br /><br />&quot;&lt;###&gt;&quot; means encrypted connection <br />&quot;&lt;---&gt;&quot; means unencrypted connection<br />&quot;(relays)&quot; means at least one relay, maybe a chain of relays<br /><br />You can see there is considerable vulnerability from the fact that the final connection to the website is completely unencrypted, which means that exit node can see exactly what you&#039;re doing on the website. This is why Tor browser comes with &quot;HTTPS Everywhere&quot; installed by default - this way the exit node doesn&#039;t see unencrypted communications (assuming the site&#039;s ssl is configured securely), although it can still see the exact website you&#039;re visiting. But to monitor all traffic within Tor network would require the adversary own all the nodes/relays.<br /><br />Hidden services are within the Tor network and follow the onion router protocol so there&#039;s no exit node and everything is 100% end-to-end encrypted). The protocol is designed to ensure anonymous communication between the hidden server and the user. The way it works is the hidden service (HS) publishes a list with a number of relays it designates as &quot;Introduction Points&quot; (IP) that it listens to for connection requests. When a User wants to connect to the HS, he must select a different relay as a &quot;Rendevous&quot;(R) and create a circuit to it, then build a circuit to one of the IP&#039;s to tell the HS the rendevous point relay, which the HS then builds a circuit to. Then the user can closes the IP circuit and communicate with the HS at the rendevous point. It looks like this:<br /><br />(1) User selects some relay as a rendevous point (R) and creates circuit:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (R)<br /><br />(2) User connects to information point (IP) to tell HS the rendevous relay:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (IP) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; HS<br /><br />(3) User connects to the HS using the circuit to the rendevous:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (R) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; HS<br /><br /><br />This whole process in accomplished by the Vidalia client and requires no input from the user beyond entering the .onion address into the Tor browser. There&#039;s also a lot of rigorous PKI trust validation of relays, key-exchanges, asymmetric crypto, etc. happening at each step throughout the process (but I&#039;m leaving that out because it&#039;s complicated enough to explain already). They can&#039;t &#039;crack&#039; PGP (unless in individual cases when it&#039;s used incorrectly), so they cannot read the actual data being transmitted within the Tor network because it&#039;s all encrypted (and signed and verified).Communucations are completely anonymized once they leave your entry node.<br /><br />tl:dr:<br />As long as the entry node is not comprimised, Tor is safe. If the entry node *is* comprimised, you are still safe unless:<br />&nbsp;A. You&#039;re using Tor browser to connect to clearnet sites, or<br />&nbsp;B. You connect to a hidden service who&#039;s entry node is also comprimised AND the adversary knows it is used by the hidden server<br />In order for B to be true, the hidden service itself has to already be de-anonymized and its IP address known. But that would be the hidden service that is comprimised, not Tor itself.

An internal/active attacker adds nodes to the network to observe traffic on the network, an external/passive attacker monitors nodes that are already on the network by spying on their traffic at their ISP, or IX&#039;s. It is extraordinarily difficult bordering on impossible to detect a passive attacker, and the only reason we have more than speculation in regards to the NSA&#039;s passive internet surveillance is because of the leaked documents from AT&amp;T showing that they installed fiber optic splitters and Narusinsight supercomputers at multiple IX&#039;s. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Between 17-23:00 (UTC) 226 exiting relays, all with largely identical nicknames (&quot;trotsky*&quot;) and exit policies were added to the tor network.

If the NSA really wanted to pwn SR I am quite confident that they could do so. First of all , tracing hidden services is not even that impressive. There are attacks for tracing them up to their entry guards in a matter of minutes. At that point they are as anonymous as someone using THREE one hop proxies, which isn&#039;t even as safe as using a single one hop proxy. If any of the entry guards are in the USA, it would only be a matter of time to passively put one of the entry guards under surveillance, with the CALEA compliant infrastructure or in the case of the NSA with their Narusinsight super computers that are plugged into split fiber optic cables moving most internet traffic in the USA through them. After locating the hidden service they could passively monitor it and wait for targets to use entry guards that they passively monitor, that would get people using USA based entry guards pretty rapidly, as having any US entry guards would mean you are deanonymized in short order. <br /><br />Or they could just break out their zero day arsenal and craft an attack that can exploit Apache on Ubuntu to root the SR server, then from there exploit a vulnerability in Firefox and root DPR, possibly another exploit for breaking out of Virtualbox isolation to get to his host OS, and then steal his IP address and send it back to themselves. if he uses random WiFi locations they they have to get around that as well. I am not saying it is trivial to do, but the NSA stockpiles zero days and it is quite likely they already have a combination that could be used to cut through all of DPR&#039;s security measures, or the security measures of anyone else here. You could keep your encryption keys and bitcoins safe from them with air gaps, but not your IP address. They wouldn&#039;t even need to spend a million or two dollars to be able to do this against DPR, because they have already spent many millions of dollars to be able to do this against whatever target comes to interest them (Iranian nuclear centrifuges being a likely example of such a target). <br /><br />At the end of the day you are going to be hard pressed to keep yourself secure against an elite organization with billions of dollars at their disposal, and essentially a free pass to break whatever laws they want. But also at the end of the day, this is not our threat model. We are not a hostile foreign government, we are not Osama Bin Laden and we are not trying to steal sensitive US intelligence. We are drug dealers, not even as powerful as the Mexican or Columbian cartels, and our enemies are the FBI, DEA, USPI and ICE, not the CIA or NSA.&nbsp;

First of all, although you seem to understand the difference between communications security and traffic analysis, you are still somewhat confusing the issues by continuing to talk about encryption. Traffic analysis works regardless of if the communications are encrypted or not, so as far as anonymity goes it is a good bet to just pretend that all the traffic is encrypted in any case. Of course if the traffic isn&#039;t encrypted at the entry, deanonymizing would be much easier, but an attacker can still do edge attacks, aka traffic confirmation, aka end point timing correlation, even if the packets are encrypted. Almost all attacks against anonymity solutions are concerned about packet metadata, such as time of arrival, not the actual payload data of individual packets. Additionally, you are correct to say that a purely active/internal attacker must own all Tor nodes in order to see all Tor traffic. However, it is possible to see all Tor traffic without owning a single node, by monitoring the traffic into and out of nodes at ISP or IX levels. Less sophisticated attackers, hopefully the FBI and DEA falling into this category, would attack Tor by adding nodes to the network. Powerful attackers such as the NSA would monitor Tor node traffic from ISP&#039;s / IX&#039;s, passively, without having to add any nodes to the network at all. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hidden services are within the Tor network and follow the onion router protocol so there&#039;s no exit node and everything is 100% end-to-end encrypted). The protocol is designed to ensure anonymous communication between the hidden server and the user. The way it works is the hidden service (HS) publishes a list with a number of relays it designates as &quot;Introduction Points&quot; (IP) that it listens to for connection requests. When a User wants to connect to the HS, he must select a different relay as a &quot;Rendevous&quot;(R) and create a circuit to it, then build a circuit to one of the IP&#039;s to tell the HS the rendevous point relay, which the HS then builds a circuit to. Then the user can closes the IP circuit and communicate with the HS at the rendevous point. It looks like this:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes everything is 100% encrypted up to the hidden service, but this doesn&#039;t mean much in terms of anonymity. Well, to be fair it means a lot, because if the traffic is not encrypted en route then the attacker could just spy on it at your entry node to deanonymize you. But as I said before, when contemplating attacks on anonymity systems, more often than not it is safe to work from the assumption that all of the traffic is encrypted, because most anonymity attacks are concerned with packet metadata which is available regardless of if the traffic payload data is encrypted or plaintext. The difference is between communications privacy and communications anonymity; although anonymity massively benefits from encryption, a large majority of anonymity attacks remain viable even if the traffic is layer encrypted end to end. Hidden service connections being encrypted end to end provides you with communications privacy, an attacker at an exit node can no longer eavesdrop on your communications. Hidden service connections being encrypted end to end has virtually no impact on your anonymity, the packet arrival timing metadata is still available and this is what is required to do the most feared deanonymizing attack against Tor (traffic confirmation, end point timing attack). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(1) User selects some relay as a rendevous point (R) and creates circuit:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (R)<br /><br />(2) User connects to information point (IP) to tell HS the rendevous relay:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (IP) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; HS<br /><br />(3) User connects to the HS using the circuit to the rendevous:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; User &lt;###&gt; (entry node) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; (R) &lt;###&gt; (relays) &lt;###&gt; HS<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes you are correct about this. In the case of a connection to a clearnet site, active/internal timing attacks look like this:<br /><br />user &lt;###&gt; Adversary Owned Entry &lt;###&gt; Good Middle &lt;###&gt; Adversary Owned Exit &lt;---&gt; Destination Server<br /><br />The adversary can link the stream through the entry to the stream through the exit with statistics, using the packet arrival metadata, which exists regardless of if the packet is plaintext or ciphertext.<br /><br />In the case of a hidden service, the completed circuit and internal timing attack looks like this:<br /><br />User &lt;###&gt; Adversary Owned Entry &lt;###&gt; Good Middle &lt;###&gt; Good Rendezvous &lt;###&gt; HS Good Final &lt;###&gt; HS Good middle &lt;###&gt; Adversary Owned Entry &lt;###&gt; Hidden Service server<br /><br />The attack is carried out in the same way, but now instead of having to own the clients entry and exit nodes, the attacker needs to own the client and hidden services entry node. Of course they will only see a connection to an IP address, and they cannot by this alone determine that the IP address is the hidden service. However, as they own one of the hidden services entry nodes, they can do this:<br /><br />Adversary &lt;###&gt; (Adversaries circuit to hidden service) &lt;###&gt; (Hidden Service Relays to adversaries circuit) &lt;###&gt; Adversary Owned Entry Node &lt;###&gt; Hidden Service<br /><br />as the adversary is connecting to the hidden service with its .onion address, their timing attack can identify the hidden service once the packets from them as a client pass through their entry guard. Now they have identified the hidden services IP address, and know when they do their timing attack against regular users in the future, that the regular users are connecting to the hidden service instead of just some IP address that is not identified as being linked to any particular hidden service.<br /><br />Also, an attacker can trace up to a hidden services good entry guards in the following way:<br /><br /><br />Adversary &lt;###&gt; (Adversaries circuit to hidden service) &lt;###&gt; (Hidden Service Relays to adversaries circuit) &lt;###&gt; Entry Node &lt;###&gt; Hidden Service<br /><br />every time the adversary creates a connection to the hidden service, the nodes consisting of (Hidden Service Relays to adversaries circuit) change, selected from the current pool of available Tor nodes, as determined by the Tor circuit construction protocol. The hidden services entry node is selected from one of three nodes it has selected as guards, which currently rotate about once every month to two months. The attack is simply brute force: build a circuit to the hidden service, send a packet down it, close the circuit, rinse and repeat. The adversary can select to use a rendezvous point that they own, allowing them to identify the final node from the hidden service. Eventually, after forcing the hidden service to open enough new circuits, the adversary will have one of their Tor relays on the circuit to the hidden service. Now they do timing attacks on their nodes looking to see if one of the packets they send to the hidden service travels to it through one of their nodes.&nbsp; If they have the final node, they will be able to identify the middle node. If they own the middle node, they will be able to identify the entry guard, and they will know it is the middle node as they can identify the final node from their rendezvous point, and if they send a packet to a node that is not a public Tor relay they will know it is the hidden service and that they are its entry guard (which will be easy to confirm as they will see a LOT of the packets they send to the hidden service). This attack allows for quick tracing of hidden services up to their entry guards.<br /><br />Additionally, it is incorrect to say that you are required to own Tor relays to do these attacks. In reality you are only required to be able to observe traffic going into and out of Tor relays. Attackers who can not gain access to ISPs / IXs will have to resort to either running relays or hacking into operating relays. Powerful attackers such as the NSA can certainly spy on good Tor nodes (especially in the USA) to observe the traffic entering and exiting from them, and thus they do not have much motivation to add their own nodes to the network, especially as active surveillance is much easier to identify than passive surveillance. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This whole process in accomplished by the Vidalia client and requires no input from the user beyond entering the .onion address into the Tor browser. There&#039;s also a lot of rigorous PKI trust validation of relays, key-exchanges, asymmetric crypto, etc. happening at each step throughout the process (but I&#039;m leaving that out because it&#039;s complicated enough to explain already). They can&#039;t &#039;crack&#039; PGP (unless in individual cases when it&#039;s used incorrectly), so they cannot read the actual data being transmitted within the Tor network because it&#039;s all encrypted (and signed and verified).Communucations are completely anonymized once they leave your entry node.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Someone already corrected you on this, and indeed Tor is what manages everything, Vidalia is merely a graphical user interface that allows you to control some of what Tor does. You can access hidden services without using Vidalia at all. Also, the cryptography is all but entirely irrelevant to the counter traffic analysis properties of Tor; although unencrypted traffic being sent from entry to exit would be almost completely incompatible with anonymity, the direct attacks on anonymity protocols that are studied today pretty much all work with the assumption that the traffic is end to end encrypted. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">tl:dr:<br />As long as the entry node is not comprimised, Tor is safe. If the entry node *is* comprimised, you are still safe unless:<br />&nbsp;A. You&#039;re using Tor browser to connect to clearnet sites, or<br />&nbsp;B. You connect to a hidden service who&#039;s entry node is also comprimised AND the adversary knows it is used by the hidden server<br />In order for B to be true, the hidden service itself has to already be de-anonymized and its IP address known. But that would be the hidden service that is comprimised, not Tor itself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A is mostly true, although I would clarify that <br /><br />1. The entry guard can be actively compromised, meaning that an attacker owns it<br />2. The entry guard can be passively compromised, meaning that it uses an ISP or IX that spies on it<br />3. The entry guard and its&#039; ISP/IX can both be good, but you can still be deanonymized if YOU are being monitored by your ISP or IX<br /><br />B is true, and I guess you actually have understood that risk from the get go :). However, if you own a hidden services entry guard, it is trivial to determine that you do. Also I guess I should point out that you are less likely to use an entry guard owned by the same attacker who owns the hidden services entry guard than you are to use a malicious exit node owned by the same person who uses your entry node, because you use a new exit node roughly once every ten minutes where as the hidden services entry guard used is selected from three guards that change only once every month to two months. So you are afforded some extra protection in this case. However it is not that hard for an attacker to identify the entry guards used by a hidden service, and it is likely somewhat of a safe bet that a half decent attacker could put a hidden service under passive surveillance. Actual evidence points to the FBI not being such a skilled attacker, but this is likely due to incompetence on their part rather than the inherent security of Tor.

None of these agencies are on the level of NSA or CIA. They play a different game with a different list of targets and a different list of targeted activities. They have little cooperation or collaboration with each other, and when they do it is usually with the FBI counter terrorism people, who are also not likely to be the FBI agents trying to attack SR, as SR is not a terrorist organization. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">80% of internet traffic is video and a good chunk of that is porn.

Usually based on entanglement , two particles become entangled and a change in one causes the same change in the other even across significant distance. This can be used to communicate between two points without the possibility of interception, avoiding the need to encrypt the communications in a traditional way in the first place. Also one system based on I believe unobservability (or is it uncertainty?) that allows the communicating parties to instantly detect if their communications are being intercepted between point a and point b, and act accordingly (like generate a new traditional key and try to send it again). At least this is my non-physics-major understanding of the quantum based encryption techniques. They all require expensive specialized tools and connections, like laser beams or straight point to point fiber optic cables. Not something civilians will be using any time soon imo. <br /><br />In short, traditional encryption scrambles data so that if it is intercepted on the line the attacker can not see the plaintext, quantum encryption techniques transfer data in such a way that it cannot be intercepted in the first place, or can not be intercepted without the interception being immediately detected.

				Good lord... I disappear from this thread for a week or two, and look at what I miss!&nbsp; A wealth of info, kmfkewm.&nbsp; I have no doubt that face-to-face a lot of people tend to be bored by your attention to detail (I&#039;ve certainly learned most people don&#039;t care, at least), but I assure you, there are those of us who see the value it holds.&nbsp; Of course you can&#039;t take anything at face value without at least a little healthy skepticism, but regardless -- your effort and info are appreciated :)
