				Hey everyone i&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s possible to get in a cash deposit through bitinstant - 7/11 cash deposit during sundays?<br />I can&#039;t use the bank deposit options since all banks are closed right now, and i&#039;m running against time. <br /><br />Never understood on how a 7/11 or cvs can be used to acquire bitcoins,&nbsp; a step by step instruction would be very much appreciated! <br />

				Never heard of such a thing.&nbsp; Maybe MoneyPak or another card you could buy in exchange for BTC is available there.&nbsp; Try finding a bank further away with better hours.&nbsp; Also use https://www.aurumxchange.com/ for 1/2 the rates of BitInstant and twice the professionalism.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Holy crap, you really can do it.&nbsp; I was skeptical it was possible.&nbsp; When I used to use BitInstant it didn&#039;t have those features.&nbsp; Best of luck, but I don&#039;t understand it either.&nbsp; I would like to see some elaboration on this too.

				Yes, I did this today in fact. I wasn&#039;t asked to provide any ID so I think you can use a fake name and contact info, but your location might be different.<br /><br />-When setting up your order on bitinstant select &quot;7-11&quot; for the deposit. You should be offered a variety of locations, including CVS stores and other convenience stores in your area. Basically, anywhere that has a MoneyGram kiosk.<br />-Take the invoice printout from bitinstant (or write down the info) and your cash to the store you select. Then ask where the Money Gram kiosk is located. <br />-The kiosk will have a red phone. Pick up the phone and&nbsp; select the option for &quot;paying a bill&quot;. You&#039;ll have to give the account numbers from your bitinstant invoice and then wait for an operator to complete the transaction. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get an operator, but it may have just been busy at that time.<br />-You&#039;ll confirm the account numbers, etc. with the operator. You&#039;ll also have to provide a name, address, and phone number...I&#039;m pretty sure it can be fake, but try to match whatever you put in at bitinstant in case they check against it. The operator will enter your info so that the 7-11/CVS employee can finish the transaction.<br />-After finishing with the operator, go back to the checkout counter at the store to complete the transaction. If the staff seem confused, just tell them it is for a bill payment through MoneyGram. They probably won&#039;t ask for details, but if they do, you can claim that you are just paranoid about putting your credit card info on the internet. Or, that you don&#039;t have a bank account and this is how you have to pay your cable bill.<br />-The store staff will ask for your name (use the same name as before, but again, they didn&#039;t check my ID), will look up your info on their computer, and will then take your money. You might have to confirm the amount of the payment on their credit card swipe machine, but you don&#039;t have to provide any personal info. <br />-They will give you a receipt and you are done. Go home and check your bitcoin wallet. My funds showed up after about an hour and half. <br /><br />You may still be able to make the deposit now, if the stores in your area are still open. <br /><br />Good luck!

				http://vimeo.com/44849463<br /><br /><br />Vid tutorial showing you how.<br /><br />The easiest method I found was by using bitfloor.com and making&nbsp; a Chase deposit slip deposit. And it&#039;s free and instant. The money gets deposited from cash to bitflloor&#039;s chase accnt in seconds and then it would take you 1 hour to transfer the bitcoins from bitfloor to silk road&#039;s wallet. It&#039;s free and instant and you don&#039;t need a chase accnt. You can use cash.
