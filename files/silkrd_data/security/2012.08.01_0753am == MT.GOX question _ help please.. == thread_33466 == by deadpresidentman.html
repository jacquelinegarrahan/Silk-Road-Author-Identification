				Hey, <br /><br />I&#039;m under the belief that you only need to do this to get verified?<br /><br />I&#039;m not verified on one account., never gave them an id of mine and it works. On another account I had scanned my gov. issued id and have put a few thousand dollars worth of coins through the account and nothing bad has resulted ( as long as you follow the AML laws.. dont try to put more than 1,000$ per 24 hours and no more than 10,000 every month unless you become verified or i think they&#039;d flag your account.<br />I have friends who have used expired ID&#039;s, false information, old names (not a recommendation, but up to you of course)<br />good luck!

				Yep, sounds like you accessed mtgox with tor when you were trying buy your coins?<br />That will lock you out for 24hrs and flag your accound for AML verification, had the same thing happen to me when I started.<br /><br />All you need to do is open another gox account using your clear web browser then only ever use the clear web browser to buy and sell coins and you should be fine.<br />As long as you dont then go over the limits 10k$ per month, you should be able to buy your coins without needing to provide any ID :)

				I opened a MT Gox&nbsp; account recently, didn&#039;t verify it by sending ID and it all worked fine. Deposited Â£50 just to test, they said they&#039;d send an e-mail when funds cleared. That didn&#039;t arrive but checked account 2 days later and funds were in. Bought coins same day. Have never used Gox through TOR, as others are suggesting this may be the problem. <br /><br />Have just withdrawn the coins from Gox to SR though, but have read in other posts some conflicting points involving tumbling and all sorts of techy jargon I don&#039;t understand :(&nbsp; Can anyone advise me whether it&#039;s okay to do what I&#039;ve just done/ I figure it is, bitcoins are now in my SR account but I just want piece of mind before I complete the next and best stage of this process. Buying something :)<br /><br />Hi to all fellow users :)

There was a guide that suggested the following process: [Via proxy] Gox - Instawallet - [Via Tor] Bitcoinfog - Instawallet - SR<br /><br />Safer not to have a direct link between the two imo. Happy shopping ;)
