				Made an order from Exotica last wed and still have not received anything.&nbsp; Now I notice there are like stamps stuck to the side of the back of my PO box... they may have been there before -- and I might just be way paranoid here.&nbsp; Exotica got a new GPG key recently so I hope he didn&#039;t get flipped or anything.&nbsp; I am supposed to be getting 2 more pckgs tomorrow, so if they don&#039;t come I guess that&#039;s it for SR for me.

				I haven&#039;t dealt with him recently, but last time I placed an order with him it was legit.

				i haven&#039;t dealt with him but he&#039;s been gone for 2 days, which is surprising considering none of his listings are gone.&nbsp; i am going to go back and investigate that stamp thing, part of me is super worried about it, but the other part says why would they flag a PO box with something that I could see too?&nbsp; guess i&#039;ll know tomorrow whether or not me and SR have a future - 2 other things from 2 diff vendors are scheduled...

				Hmm no offense but you don&#039;t have that large a post count so I think Exotica should be allowed to address this thread before people start jumping.

				It&#039;s probably not him, and all his listings got pulled cause he&#039;s been gone for 3 days.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on the road for 4 months, spending over 5k on 40 transactions but only recently had to register to give some vendor requested feedback for SM.&nbsp; I saw some of his other old feedback said they had the same problem with single-pill shipments.&nbsp; Hopefully it&#039;s nothing, and he will return gloriously.
