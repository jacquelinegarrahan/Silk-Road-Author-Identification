				So my package failed to deliver to due &quot;unknown addressee&quot; which is fucking stupid because the name/address was written perfectly according to the vendor, and I&#039;ve NEVER had a problem receiving ANY packages since it was my real name and address. So it&#039;s on its way back to the return address, which is unfortunately fake, so it will be routed to the USPS Recovery Center. From here, they will fucking scan it and obviously open it, finding the weed. How worried should I be? I was fucking dumb enough to call USPS customer support with my cell to be like wtf where&#039;s my package. Seriously I&#039;m so sketched out right now and I&#039;ve got no idea how to deal with this. What are the chances they decide two ounces is enough to chase down? I live in a very populated city on US east coast.

				Umm actually I don&#039;t think they open the packages. I heard / read somewhere I think that they eventually take them to a place to be burned or destroyed. Also if you sent the seller your information correctly then it is their fault and they should reship at no expense

				Just go get it. Tell them your looking for your package. Act stupid if they say or do anything that looks suspicious. They are not supposed to open anything and they won&#039;t according to their own policies.

				Actually, according to the USPS Recovery Center FAQ, they DO open packages sent there to figure out who to send it to, unless the contents are worth over 25.00 bucks where they then auction shit off.

I bet they don&#039;t auction that shit off. I&#039;d say they are getting stoned with your shit. Maybe if you knew how long they waited before they opened the packages maybe you could claim it but that would be scary as hell. If it&#039;s stealthy enough they may never know it&#039;s herb.

				why would they open packages to see who to send it to???<br />the fukin address isnt inside the package<br />that makes no sense...<br />sounds like the vendor screwed up to me and should reship<br />b/c if the address was right then they would deliver it.<br />&nbsp;if the address didnt exist then they would return to sender then find out that is also a non existant address <br />from there they probally throw the shit in some box and say fuk it<br /><br /><br />but I&#039;m no lawyer or USPS employee so I&#039;m just coming from a common sense point of view

Protips right here.<br /><br />This is why you put at least one of the addressee&#039;s address on the INSIDE of a pack, which should be wrapped in a TYVEK priority / express envelope/bag. The fucking postal machinery grabs your pack and tears it to shit? Thank gawd and you knew what you were doing and wrapped the contents up tidy like in a tyvek USPS bag w/ address label on it too, so now this fucking disaster gets taped back up by postal workers w/ new outer envelope and sent on it&#039;s way without issue.<br /><br />as for Addressee Unknown, sounds to me like your postal worker was not familiar with the name used for delivery or the venodr is lying...?

				Well the thing is the vendor showed me the name/address he used, and it&#039;s perfect. My Postman has NEVER had a problem with my name on a package before... Been living here for more than a year and I get packages all the time.
