				Be carefull as a lot of those vendors could be scams. I&#039;ve used Moneyhoney and JumboMonkeyBiscuit and both were honest and came through. Jumbo is currently only working with customers who has done 3 or more transactions with him so i used Moneyhoney last week and she came through. As a former newbie all i can suggest is research, research, research. When you are new it is easy to make a mistake here. It took a lot of time for me to learn everything I needed to here and even still I do not consider myself an expert. It&#039;s a wonderful place though and I love it. Long live the road.

				I personally use bitbargain, slightly over the gox average price, but always extremely quick service, and can pay using pingit, which is a hell of a lot easier and quicker than using standard bank transfer
