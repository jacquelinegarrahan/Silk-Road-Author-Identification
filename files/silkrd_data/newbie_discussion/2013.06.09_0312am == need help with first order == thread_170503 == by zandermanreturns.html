				Have you opened a Silk Road buyers account? If so, is it funded? If so, have you learned pgp?<br />If those 3 things are done just go to the product you want and click &quot;add to cart&quot; and the Road will lead you thru the purchase.<br />If those things aren&#039;t done, you got some research to do. <br />You probably know this, but, just in case, these forums are NOT Silk Road .Just forums for it, the Road is a different site.<br />

The address is the most important thing to encrypt, many vendors ONLY want the addy encrypted and not other communications because it&#039;s a pain in their asses and it takes time.&nbsp; So, next time you order, encrypt your addy but this one is done already. Your &quot;in processing&quot; right??? Just watch that , where it says that on your order page, at some point nit will chgange to &quot;in transit&quot; . This usually means your order has shipped, I say usually because some vendors, for whatever reason, sometimes mark in transit and then don&#039;t ship right away. <br />So, sounds like your all set, just learn pgp for next time. I made quite a few orders B4 I learned encryption. <br />Hope this helps

				You don&#039;t need to send the vendor a message but next time it is very important you don&#039;t forget to encrypt your address. From here you play the waiting game don&#039;t finalize early and as soon as your product arrives finalize the payment.

The slowest part is usually waiting for the bitcoins to transfer from my wallet on the above site to the road.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see you&#039;re a senior member here so that&#039;s encouraging.&nbsp; How long have you used blockchain?&nbsp; <br /><br />May I repeat the process to you just to confirm that I understand?<br /><br />1) I open a wallet at blockchain<br /><br />2) I make a cash deposit&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I posted the following in another post , maybe this will help...<br /><br /><br />Create a blockchain wallet, then while your on your blockchain wallet page, hit the deposit cash link. It will walk you thru the process, which, utilizes bitinstant for the deposit. Again, it will walk you thru it. .Moneygram doesn&#039;t do bitcoiuns per say, it is just used to send money, from their point of view, your just paying&nbsp; bill.<br />Here&#039;s how it works<br /><br />1- create a wallet on blockchain, it&#039;s anonymous<br />2- hit the cash deposit link (this must be done with your wallet page open)<br />3- it will walk you thru the process and give you all the info you need to take to a moneygram outlet<br />4- at moneygram, you will send your $$$ to an intermediate company,given to you by blockchain, I wont mention the name here but to moneygram it looks like your paying a bill...(bitinstant will give you a receiver code for the intermediate co, this code ID&#039;s that company for moneygram so they know who to send it to)<br />4- this intermediate company will do the rest and your dollars will magically appear in your blockchain wallet as bitcoins<br />5- transfer to your SR wallet (it can take a few hours for this transfer to go thru, don&#039;t worry , it works)<br /><br />The reason for the middle wallet is security, and, I&#039;m not sure you can deposit right into the SR wallet, unless you trust one of the SR bitcoin vendors to do it but that is done outside the escrow system and it&#039;s easy for them to burn you, and, they can sometimes take&nbsp; lot longer than most people would like.<br /><br />I hope that all made sense.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />2a) Do I actually have to provide my full name and DOB?<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Sometimes the moneygram location asks for ID, sometimes they don&#039;t. DOB don&#039;t matter but you should use a name you can back up with ID, just in case. It&#039;s just for the blockchain wallet, nothing illegal there.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />3)&nbsp; I print out the slip and bring the cash to a money transfer terminal and they&#039;ll know what to do from there?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Yep, in fact, I print nothing, I just write down account #, and receiver code # and bring em.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />4) After I have $$$ in my wallet, how do I transfer those funds into my SR account?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Goto account page on SR, get your wallet address # , goto blockchain wallet and click send money and paste SR wallet #&nbsp; in appropriate place. This transfer is usually the loingest wait of the process and can take anywhere from an hour or so to 3-4 hours. Average for me is 1.5 hrs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow 88fxstc... thank you for such a detailed and easy-to-understand reply :-)<br /><br />While I&#039;ve got your attention, may I ask your opinion on earning bitcoins through bonus programs?<br /><br />I found this while doing some research: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bonus_Programs<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I&#039;m glad it helped brutha. <br />I don&#039;t know anything about the bonus programs, and I&#039;m too tired now to check it out. <br />Have fun on the Road my friend....

				Another way to get Bitcoin is through http://bitcoin-otc.com/<br /><br />It&#039;s like a trading post or craig&#039;s list but for bitcoin - someone will list that they are selling, and you can contact them to buy. Though it probably works best if you are in the same country as the seller, as to buy, you transfer $ to their account and this is easier within same country. In my case, the seller asked me to provide a screenshot as evidence that I had transferred $, then they transferred the equivalent in Bitcoin to me, minus their fee which was minimal. then you just need to transfer the necessary amount into your SR wallet (I use Bitcoin QT as my local wallet).

				@RobLoblaw - in my case, I had met the guy in person and had a prior relationship. Obviously that can still not be adequate protection, but Bitcoin-OTC operates a &#039;web of trust&#039; see clearnet link http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php - so you can get a sense of how trustworthy sellers are in the network through that. I also started off with a low amount of $, in case things went wrong. In my case things went well, but I guess the risk is still there.

				@88fxstc<br /><br />I&#039;m getting an error message at blockchain.<br /><br />When I click on Cash Deposit and enter the requested information, I receive a message that the payment method is invalid.<br /><br />I feel like I read somewhere today (this forum or reddit) that blockchain wasn&#039;t accepting payments this weekend.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try again tomorrow AM but wanted to see if you had any insights.
