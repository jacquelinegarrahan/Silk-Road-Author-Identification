				Don&#039;t mean to hijack your thread. Sorry you&#039;re having troubles. I have hundreds of 5mg IR&#039;s in capsules and pills, and I have about a bottle full of 40mg old school before they apparently changed them.&nbsp; The 40&#039;s are a few years old but are still potent because they have been properly stored. <br />I don&#039;t really want to assume the cost and risk of becoming a vendor because I don&#039;t get the 40&#039;s anymore and only get 5&#039;s and 20&#039;s in limited quantity. I thought about maybe selling them through that &quot;SR craigslist&quot; listing, but I&#039;m just not sure. I wish I could just trade them for a pile of absolute shatter....;)<br /><br />What do you think some old but still good 40mg&#039;s are worth each? Which 5mg IR is more desirable the capsules or little white pills? Are 5mg&#039;s even desirable at all? Just curious about a fair price. thanks. (not looking to sidestep the SR process)

				@ wallace....the 5mg pills would definitely sell out fast (i know from experience)! now the 40&#039;s are up in the air; but as long as you are honest about their shelf life you could work it....It&#039;s worth the investment to me to open a VENDORS account.

				Thanks for the info BK and Cryngie.<br />I was thinking 50cents/mg for something like this. (as long as I could get rid of them in bulk) I don&#039;t like messing with USPS for any reason, much less this one. Something like 250usd per 100 5mg Ir&#039;s? Maybe 600usd per 30 40mg?<br /><br />The oldest factory sealed bottle is from &#039;09 and they have been kept in climate controlled storage. IDK what the shelf life is for these. I think I&#039;ll take 1/2 of a 40mg time release later this evening and see what they&#039;re like. <br /><br />Also, while checking my stash, I noticed most of the 40mg time release are round but there are a few that are oval shaped. IDK if this means ovals are generic or what. Are generics worth less? Seems like it would be the same ingredients.<br /><br />I have quite a few 20mg time release as well, but they are thicker than what I used to get. I&#039;m guessing they are of the &quot;tamper proof&quot; variety. I don&#039;t bang or snort them. I simply take them by mouth as prescribed, so I&#039;m (obviously) not familiar with the differences. <br />Are the tamper proof ones worth less as well?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, sorry for the tangent and for intruding on this thread. But, I thought I might get some answers from experienced people to determine if I should get a vendor account or not. One of the biggest factors would be how much I could get for them and if it would be worth the trouble, expense, and risk.<br />Any advice is greatly appreciated. (again, sorry for the intrusion BK)

				Man this story pisses me off. Do these vendors think people are stupid. You pay top dollar for a product and when you get it they&#039;re half fake? Total bullshit. I hate cowards like that. Cowards cause they&#039;d never try it in person (can you say beat down?). People pay-just deliver what you promised. Nothing extra-nothing less.<br /><br />On a side note the $/mg for oxy is expensive on SR. Not unusual to see &gt;$1/mg. Curious what they get on the street per mg. Anyone know how much of a premium we&#039;re paying? Do any vendors drop the price for repeat customers? <br /><br />For the vendors, how much delivery success do you have when shipping within the US? I&#039;d imagine it would be close to 100% since they&#039;re small with no scent (assuming address etc is correct).

				I got 5 fake pills out of 10 from NOLUV22 too. I won my resolution case and got 70% refund for the 5 pills, while the 5 real ones were very old low quality. He tried to lie to the resolution team and say I was being difficult and that they weren&#039;t fake, LOL! So I took screen shots of all our messages and took pictures of the pills. You can read all about my purchase experience with him here, http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=211362.msg1566695#msg1566695 I was also able to give him a 1 star rating and reviewed my purchase but I haven&#039;t been able to go to his profile to see it because his shit has been shut down or on private mode or something for the last few days.

As for the first one, vendors can easily send coin back to you if the order is short. There is no need for a reship, so I can tell you right now he&#039;s bullshitting you (seems like you know that and want confirmation). How fake are the fake pills looks-wise. Photograph the entire order and the packaging, and save any messages that you have. You&#039;ll get a partial refund on that in resolution as someone else has said.<br /><br />I hope you reported them.<br /><br />You see the thing is (and I&#039;m mulling becoming an oxy vendor right now), there are good oxy vendors, and there are those who know that others suffer greatly when they run out and they take advantage of that. They assume that because you&#039;re an &quot;addict&quot; (not talking about you), that they can get away with anything.<br /><br />If I do decide to go through with vending, I&#039;d never treat you like that (I have my own non-oxy habits so I can totally relate).&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna look those two up while I&#039;m logged into SR right now.

				hi hi<br /><br />it&#039;s sad that some of you have had to deal with shady roxy vendors. that should not be the case!! i&#039;ve personally received many messages from previous customers and potential buyers alike telling me similar horror stories of sketchy vendors listing far more stock than they actually have and delaying orders, dying 15mg pills to make them look like 30s, selling completely fake pills, sending chipped/crushed pills, flat out not sending product... etc.<br /><br />seems to me it&#039;s as modziw said: you get what you pay for....&nbsp; and in reality he&#039;s right, you&#039;re saving money in the long run by not having to go through resolution and wait for your coins back so you can purchase proper gear via another vendor. <br /><br />in case you&#039;re all wondering or in need: i&#039;ve still got a few hundred Actavis brand in stock, and was able to secure a lower price on my most recent pickups, so i&#039;ve passed along that savings to my customers! also, i ship out every night (except saturday obviously), so if you get your order in before 11pm-midnight eastern time it will be postmarked the very next morning/day when it gets picked up.<br /><br />check out my vendor page, it&#039;s linked in my forum signature!!<br /><br />xoxo<br />-mb
