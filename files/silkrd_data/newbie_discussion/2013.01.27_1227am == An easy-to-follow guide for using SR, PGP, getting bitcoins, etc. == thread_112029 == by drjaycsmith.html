				***<br /><br />If you&#039;re reading this, you&#039;ve at least figured out how to install/use a Tor browser (download available at https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) and have acquired the Silk Road URL (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion).<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in learning more about Tor and similar browsers, go to:<br /><br />-- https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/index.html<br />-- https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en<br /><br />Remember never to use your Tor browser to go to sites you normally do--and NEVER log in to services that you use, such as Facebook. Use Tor strictly for underground stuff.<br /><br />*** Test the anonymity of your browser by going to http://ip-check.info/?lang=en ***<br /><br />The most important things to do while getting started are to read/remember the following:<br /><br />-- Read The Dread Pirate Roberts&#039; introduction message (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion//silkroad/about)<br />-- Read the buyer&#039;s guide (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide)<br />-- Remain anonymous. Do not share any personal information, details, locations, etc. with anyone. Use a strong password that is different than your regular password for legitimate sites. When you place an order, you are running a risk and it is possible that the person on the other end is law enforcement. No system is full proof, but SR has a good track record. Just be careful and only share the secrets of Silk Road with trusted friends who would use it responsibly. If you&#039;re concerned that you might ever be visited by LE or have your home searched, it&#039;s a good idea to store all damning digitial evidence (programs, keys, passwords, etc.) on a micro SD card, which can be hidden anywhere with little chance of it being found.<br />--Use the forums (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion). Reading will answer your questions, posting will share your knowledge with others, and doing both will build this community into something that we can all be proud of. Most of us already are. While you&#039;re trying to build up your 50 posts to get your Jr. Member status, why not try to answer as many questions as possible and make some new friends? Spamming is the whole reason for that dumb rule in the first place. The 50-post rule separates serious users from yahoos and &#039;bots, even if it is a pain in the ass. I made my first couple of posts before the new rule came down; and while it sucks being sent back to the minor leagues, as it were, I understand the reason for the policy.<br /><br />Right. And that&#039;s what I intend to do with this thread--answer some questions and share what I know. I discovered Silk Road by accident less than two weeks ago. I spent an evening on Google, teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it.<br /><br />Here are a couple of pretty good technical articles about Silk Road, both of which were instrumental in me getting here:<br />-- http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road.<br />-- http://dailyanarchist.com/2011/06/21/how-and-why-to-get-to-silk-road/<br /><br />So, read buyers&#039; feedback, the forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t finalize early (FE). Some legitimate vendors require customers to FE--especially new customers or when shipping to another country--but you should have no trouble finding awesome vendors who DO NOT REQUIRE THIS. (I recommend only ordering from domestic vendors, as your package will not by scrutinized by Customs. While most international orders go through fine, why risk it if you don&#039;t have to?) There are lots of choices on SR, so shop around for a vendor you&#039;re comfortable with. I personally would rather give my business to a vendor who respects the escrow system--and if he&#039;s a top seller who has great feedback or I&#039;ve done business with him in the past, I might decide to FE as a favor. The only time you should FE is if you are doing it specifically to reward a vendor for excellent service.<br /><br />FINDING A GOOD DEAL FROM A REPUTABLE VENDOR:<br /><br />First of all, locate the product that you want to buy and your options should be arranged by bestseller in descending order. Compare the prices and when you see something that looks promising, click on the product link and read ALL of the information there, especially the feedback at the bottom. When it comes to feedback, read a few pages. Next, click on the seller&#039;s name to go to his/her page, where you can read more about them and note their stats. Look at several vendors and compare prices/feedback before placing an order. Some vendors charge more, but it&#039;s because they have a better product, faster shipping, better stealth, etc. Decide what you&#039;re willing to pay and if extra $ is worth it. Now you should head over to the forums and find a thread on the product you&#039;re interested in or on a specific vendor. This is where you will get your most detailed information. If you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for, post a new topic and ask. It is also worth mentioning that new vendors often post awesome deals to bring in new customers and establish themselves. Take advantage of the deals by placing a small order as a test, that way you won&#039;t be risking much. Do this a couple of times and wait for stats to build ... but don&#039;t wait too long to place a larger order or you will miss the sale price.<br /><br />OBTAINING AND TRANSFERRING BITCOINS:<br /><br />A common problem seems to be finding an easy way to get bitcoins. At first, this can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Use the following instructions if you&#039;re in the USA and you won&#039;t be scammed.<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account or use your real info unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- In BitInstant, use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use a bogus name, address, telephone number, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter much anyway, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. You won&#039;t have to show ID when sending the MoneyGram. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think that matters either.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee plus they deduct 3.99%.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- While logged into your Mt. Gox account, use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transferring funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release. There are many other options, but this one works and it is the one I&#039;ve been using.<br /><br />*** Avoid OnionWallet--it is a SCAM ***<br />&nbsp;<br />MORE ABOUT BITCOINS:<br /><br />Looking to buy &amp; sell bitcoins? There&#039;s lots of options.<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://bitinstant.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins, lots of options including MoneyGram. Fund Mt. Gox &amp; other exchanges. Now requires verification.<br />--&nbsp; http://tradebitcoin.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally. Best for remaining anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally. Best for remaining anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Link your bank account and buy bitcoins online. Instant transfers after 30 days &amp; full verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://www.nanaimogold.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Similar to BitInstant. Use MoneyGram &amp; Western Union to fund account.<br />--&nbsp; https://mtgox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet. Not compatible with Tor, requires verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://virwox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet. Lots of options for funding account (buying BTC).<br /><br />BitInstant &amp; Mt. Gox are becoming more transparent; you must now verify your identity to use their services. Frankly, this changes nothing--the idea that you were ever &quot;anonymous&quot; on these clearnet-only sites was a flimsy one at best. Trading bitcoins is perfectly legal--and believe it or not, crypto currencies such as BTC can be used for more than just buying drugs on Silk Road.<br /><br />No matter what you do, you lose some or all of your anonymity when buying coins; therefore, you should &quot;launder&quot; them.<br /><br />Here are some Tor-compatible sites to route your coins through before depositing them at Silk Road, which itself acts as a tumbler:<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://easywallet.org/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinfog.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Launders bitcoins. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br /><br />BitInstant, with or without Mt. Gox, is a breeze. Just send a MoneyGram from Wal-Mart or another retailer. You can also link your bank account. Unfortunately, the site is temporarily down as they make some improvements.<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ is perhaps the easiest method for obtaining bitcoins. Find someone near you, meet them, pay cash for BTC. I&#039;ve used this option and it was fast and hassle-free. The transaction is more-or-less anonymous, depending on how you handle it.<br /><br />After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, you might send them through Bitcoin Fog. Personally, I never have; others give the service a mixed review. Either way, the next step is to transfer your bitcoins to BlockChain and then EasyWallet; from there, send them to Silk Road. Use at least 2 - 3 anonymous, torified wallets before Silk Road; also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address before/after every transaction, withdrawal, deposit, etc. You should be changing it constantly, even though SR launders coins with its own tumbler. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance?<br /><br />USING PGP TO ENCRYPT MESSAGES AND YOUR ADDRESS:<br /><br />*** Use GPG4USB for best results/security. Download it at http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html. ***<br /><br />For a tutorial, use your Tor browser to go to http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/.<br /><br />You&#039;ll need an anonymous email address. Use your Tor browser to go to http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/. After signing up, use this new email address to generate a new key pair (public &amp; private) for yourself. You give your public key to other people and they use that to encrypt messages to you. Never give out your private key or password--and make sure you use a STRONG password. Set your key to the max--4096 bits.<br /><br />Using PGP to encrypt your mailing address is not strictly necessary, but it adds an extra layer of security to your transaction and many vendors request/require it. I&#039;ve found that Portable PGP (download available at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/) has a very nice interface and is easy to use; however, it is Java-based Bouncy Castle software and lacks security.<br /><br />Other PGP downloads:<br />-- http://www.pgpi.org/download/<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html<br /><br />A few good places to learn about how to use PGP are:<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.en.html<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html<br />-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto<br /><br />To download and install Portable PGP, visit http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/. Once you&#039;ve installed the program, to use Portable PGP, copy the vendor&#039;s public key into a .txt file and save it. When you open the program, you can import contacts from .txt files on your computer. Once a vendor&#039;s address has been added to your keyring, you can direct a specific message (such as your mailing address) to him/her. There is an &quot;encrypt&quot; tab, which provides you with a blank text box. Write your address or message, select your recipient(s), click &quot;encrypt,&quot; and it will open a separate window with your PGP message. Copy this string of gibberish into the SR mailing form.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Okay, that&#039;s it for now. I think that I&#039;ve covered the basics here and provided some good references; and while I&#039;m no expert, I&#039;m happy to help by sharing what I know. Hopefully I haven&#039;t forgotten anything important, but I will update if something occurs to me. Let me know if you have questions or suggestions for doing things better.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay A.K.A. The Prince of Darkness <br /><br />***

				Most excellent!<br /><br />Respectful suggestion: To the PGP section, add &quot;Do not use your real name and/or email in your PGP key unless you want to make these available to law enforcement, post them in public, and visibly attach them to yourself.&quot; <br />That usually isn&#039;t in the instructions.<br />

Not only can you buy drugs here, but the entire process is a learning experience and the community is great. When it comes to computers, I love acquiring knowledge and figuring out how to make the machine do what I want. While I don&#039;t consider myself a hacker, I can say that I enjoy hacking projects such as these. Two weeks ago, I had no idea that there was a whole other side of the Internet, which is another thing that I&#039;m going to begin exploring. Silk Road is the only Tor site I&#039;ve been to, so I&#039;m curious to see what else is out there. This whole site is a perfect, shining example of why drugs should be legal and law enforcement resources should be used to apprehend violent criminals and thieves rather than chase after average people who just happen to enjoy getting high.

				Stop downloading whatever it is that&#039;s been taking forever and get on over to Mt. Gox and BitInstant. If you have money, and if your local retailers are still open, you can go send a MoneyGram right now, buy some bitcoins, and transfer them to your Silk Road account. You&#039;re ready to order and you don&#039;t even know it. Just follow the steps that I posted above and you&#039;ll be fine.

What you want to do is install the latest nightly build, per the following instructions (originally written by Guru)<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X<br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5)<br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using<br />the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of<br />keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />============================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the<br />recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste<br />it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be<br />found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the<br />Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It<br />will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then<br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use<br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing<br />the encrypted message that was there previously.<br /><br />Guru <br /><br /><br />

As for Mt.

You don&#039;t need the wallet program that you downloaded. Buy bitcoins on Mt. Gox and then send them directly to your SR wallet.

				Sorry drjaycsmith, but that is actually bad advice. You should never transfer coins directly to your SR E-Wallet just in case the site is ever taken down by LE or Hackers. If that happens, there would be a good chance your coins would disappear forever. You need to download a Bitcoin Client, either a Web based one or a Desktop one, and transfer your coins from where you buy them to this wallet. A good one to use is Electrum - http://electrum.org/&nbsp; <br />Once you have this downloaded and installed, transfer your coins to one of the generated Bitcoin addresses. Then when your ready to make a purchase on SR, transfer the required amount of coins from your Client to your SR wallet containing your Bitcoin address. Always send a little more coin over in case of a price rise so you don&#039;t end up short when your ready to order. After every purchase you make on SR, request a new Bitcoin address. Using the same address more than once could potentially link you to more than one transaction should something ever happen to you. It&#039;s all about minimizing your risks, just in case something does go wrong.<br />Here is a link to a Bitcoin Exchange in Australia that has a detailed explanation on the different Bitcoin Clients available to be used. It outlines the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of each one so you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />This is a clearnet link -&nbsp; https://bitinnovate.com/need-a-wallet/<br /><br />&nbsp;:) :)

				No worries at all drjaycsmith and GuyLeDouche. A lot of established members of the Forum wanted to post here in the Newbie section, but we weren&#039;t allow to as the Admins had set it up so only Mod&#039;s and Newbie&#039;s were able to. Seems DPR has now changed that policy which is a good thing for all concerned. If anyone needs help with something, just drop me a line and I&#039;ll do my best. :)

This could take approx. 12 hrs+ to do.<br />I would start uo Bitcoin-Qt now and get the download started. I would wait until the history is downloaded before buying some coins. Once the download is complete and you buy some coins, the time it takes to show up in your account is controlled by a number of variables but generally it takes a couple of hours for the network to confirm your transaction.<br />Desktop Clients store a collection of keys on your computer (or wallet address). These keys allow you to send and receive bitcoins through the Bitcoin network. Nobody has access to these keys except yourself, and they must be kept secure. We always recommend creating a backup of you wallet as if this file gets corrupted or accidentally deleted your bitcoins will be lost for good.<br />I was referring to your Bitcoin address/s, contained in your Bitcoin Wallet. They look like this - 17XrAZGKJqXTPkZiTH8KWCvdnHCmBA2bg. This is the address (not this one but one contained in your wallet) you give to CanadianBitcoins to transfer the coins you purchased to.<br />Hope that helps.&nbsp; :)<br />

What you want to do is install the latest nightly build, per the following instructions (originally written by Guru)<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X<br />you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5)<br />then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using<br />the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check<br />mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you<br />need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do<br />that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration<br />menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button<br />is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences:<br />smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire<br />document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only<br />plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is<br />checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then<br />encrypt using Shift-Command-E.

Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key<br />will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a<br />TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then<br />use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in<br />your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you<br />can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message<br />to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Guru@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will<br />be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the<br />encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else<br />that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that<br />message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use<br />Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D<br />to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key,<br />you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase<br />has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted,<br />and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing<br />the encrypted message that was there previously.<br /><br />Guru&nbsp; <br /><br />There are many other useful tutorials covering a range of subjects.

You should never transfer coins directly to your SR E-Wallet just in case the site is ever taken down by LE or Hackers. If that happens, there would be a good chance your coins would disappear forever. You need to download a Bitcoin Client, either a Web based one or a Desktop one, and transfer your coins from where you buy them to this wallet. A good one to use is Electrum - http://electrum.org/&nbsp; <br />Once you have this downloaded and installed, transfer your coins to one of the generated Bitcoin addresses. Then when your ready to make a purchase on SR, transfer the required amount of coins from your Client to your SR wallet containing your Bitcoin address. Always send a little more coin over in case of a price rise so you don&#039;t end up short when your ready to order. After every purchase you make on SR, request a new Bitcoin address. Using the same address more than once could potentially link you to more than one transaction should something ever happen to you. It&#039;s all about minimizing your risks, just in case something does go wrong.<br />Here is a link to a Bitcoin Exchange in Australia that has a detailed explanation on the different Bitcoin Clients available to be used. It outlines the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of each one so you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />This is a clearnet link -&nbsp; https://bitinnovate.com/need-a-wallet/<br /><br />&nbsp;:) :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see your point. I think I&#039;ll follow your advice and get Electrum as an added layer of security; however, I don&#039;t store anything in my SR wallet. When I&#039;m ready to buy something, I transfer in the appropriate number of bitcoins and immediately place my order.

				New info from veteran users:<br /><br />Forget about using Portable PGP; instead, use GPG4USB. Download it at http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/download.html.<br /><br />For a tutorial, use your Tor browser to go to http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/.<br /><br />You&#039;ll need an anonymous email address. Use your Tor browser to go to http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/. After signing up, use this new email address to generate a new key pair (public &amp; private) for yourself. You give your public key to other people and they use that to encrypt messages to you. Never give out your private key or password--and make sure you use a STRONG password. Set your key to the max--4096 bits.<br /><br />Remember never to use your Tor browser to go to sites you normally do--and NEVER log in to services that you use, such as Facebook. Use Tor strictly for underground stuff.

The most important things to do while getting started are to read/remember the following:<br /><br />-- Read The Dread Pirate Roberts&#039; introduction message (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion//silkroad/about)<br />-- Read the buyer&#039;s guide (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide)<br />-- Remain anonymous. Do not share any personal information, details, locations, etc. with anyone. Use a strong password that is different than your regular password for legitimate sites. When you place an order, you are running a risk and it is possible that the person on the other end is law enforcement. No system is full proof, but SR has a good track record. Just be careful and only share the secrets of Silk Road with trusted friends who would use it responsibly. If you&#039;re concerned that you might ever be visited by LE or have your home searched, it&#039;s a good idea to store all damning digitial evidence (programs, keys, passwords, etc.) on a micro SD card, which can be hidden anywhere with little chance of it being found.<br />--Use the forums (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion). Reading will answer your questions, posting will share your knowledge with others, and doing both will build this community into something that we can all be proud of. Most of us already are. While you&#039;re trying to build up your 50 posts to get your Jr. Member status, why not try to answer as many questions as possible and make some new friends? Spamming is the whole reason for that dumb rule in the first place. The 50-post rule separates serious users from yahoos and &#039;bots, even if it is a pain in the ass. I made my first couple of posts before the new rule came down; and while it sucks being sent back to the minor leagues, as it were, I understand the reason for the policy.<br /><br />Right. And that&#039;s what I intend to do with this thread--answer some questions and share what I know. I discovered Silk Road by accident less than two weeks ago. I spent an evening on Google, teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it.<br /><br />Here are a couple of pretty good technical articles about Silk Road, both of which were instrumental in me getting here:<br />-- http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road.<br />-- http://dailyanarchist.com/2011/06/21/how-and-why-to-get-to-silk-road/<br /><br />So, read buyers&#039; feedback, the forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t finalize early (FE). Some legitimate vendors require customers to FE--especially new customers or when shipping to another country--but you should have no trouble finding awesome vendors who DO NOT REQUIRE THIS. (I recommend only ordering from domestic vendors, as your package will not by scrutinized by Customs. While most international orders go through fine, why risk it if you don&#039;t have to?) There are lots of choices on SR, so shop around for a vendor you&#039;re comfortable with. I personally would rather give my business to a vendor who respects the escrow system--and if he&#039;s a top seller who has great feedback or I&#039;ve done business with him in the past, I might decide to FE as a favor. The only time you should FE is if you are doing it specifically to reward a vendor for excellent service.<br /><br />FINDING A GOOD DEAL FROM A REPUTABLE VENDOR:<br /><br />First of all, locate the product that you want to buy and your options should be arranged by bestseller in descending order. Compare the prices and when you see something that looks promising, click on the product link and read ALL of the information there, especially the feedback at the bottom. When it comes to feedback, read a few pages. Next, click on the seller&#039;s name to go to his/her page, where you can read more about them and note their stats. Look at several vendors and compare prices/feedback before placing an order. Some vendors charge more, but it&#039;s because they have a better product, faster shipping, better stealth, etc. Decide what you&#039;re willing to pay and if extra $ is worth it. Now you should head over to the forums and find a thread on the product you&#039;re interested in or on a specific vendor. This is where you will get your most detailed information. If you can&#039;t find what you&#039;re looking for, post a new topic and ask. It is also worth mentioning that new vendors often post awesome deals to bring in new customers and establish themselves. Take advantage of the deals by placing a small order as a test, that way you won&#039;t be risking much. Do this a couple of times and wait for stats to build ... but don&#039;t wait too long to place a larger order or you will miss the sale price.<br /><br />OBTAINING AND TRANSFERRING BITCOINS:<br /><br />A common problem seems to be finding an easy way to get bitcoins. At first, this can seem like a daunting task--it isn&#039;t. Use the following instructions if you&#039;re in the USA and you won&#039;t be scammed.<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account or use your real info unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- In BitInstant, use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- While logged into your Mt. Gox account, use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transferring funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release. There are many other options, but this one works and it is the one I&#039;ve been using.<br /><br />USING PGP TO ENCRYPT MESSAGES AND YOUR ADDRESS:<br /><br />Using PGP to encrypt your mailing address is not strictly necessary, but it adds an extra layer of security to your transaction and many vendors request/require it. I&#039;ve found that Portable PGP (download available at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/) has a very nice interface and is easy to use. I ordered from one vendor who said not to use this version (I don&#039;t know why), but I did anyway and my order came as expected. I&#039;ve placed three orders now with three separate vendors, all of which were executed flawlessly.<br /><br />Other PGP downloads:<br />-- http://www.pgpi.org/download/<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html<br /><br />A few good places to learn about how to use PGP are:<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.en.html<br />-- http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html<br />-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto<br /><br />To download and install Portable PGP, visit http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/. Once you&#039;ve installed the program, to use Portable PGP, copy the vendor&#039;s public key into a .txt file and save it. When you open the program, you can import contacts from .txt files on your computer. Once a vendor&#039;s address has been added to your keyring, you can direct a specific message (such as your mailing address) to him/her. There is an &quot;encrypt&quot; tab, which provides you with a blank text box. Write your address or message, select your recipient(s), click &quot;encrypt,&quot; and it will open a separate window with your PGP message. Copy this string of gibberish into the SR mailing form.<br /><br />As I said, I&#039;ve tried several versions of PGP and this one is the easiest to use. No problems so far.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Okay, that&#039;s it for now. I think that I&#039;ve covered the basics here and provided some good references; and while I&#039;m no expert, I&#039;m happy to help by sharing what I know. Hopefully I haven&#039;t forgotten anything important, but I will update if something occurs to me. Let me know if you have questions or suggestions for doing things better.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay A.K.A. The Prince of Darkness<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />See, now this says right from mtgox to SR. Completely the opposite of other things I have read. I was told not to do that? I moved mine around to several different wallets then to SR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

You should never transfer coins directly to your SR E-Wallet just in case the site is ever taken down by LE or Hackers. If that happens, there would be a good chance your coins would disappear forever. You need to download a Bitcoin Client, either a Web based one or a Desktop one, and transfer your coins from where you buy them to this wallet. A good one to use is Electrum - http://electrum.org/&nbsp; <br />Once you have this downloaded and installed, transfer your coins to one of the generated Bitcoin addresses. Then when your ready to make a purchase on SR, transfer the required amount of coins from your Client to your SR wallet containing your Bitcoin address. Always send a little more coin over in case of a price rise so you don&#039;t end up short when your ready to order. After every purchase you make on SR, request a new Bitcoin address. Using the same address more than once could potentially link you to more than one transaction should something ever happen to you. It&#039;s all about minimizing your risks, just in case something does go wrong.<br />Here is a link to a Bitcoin Exchange in Australia that has a detailed explanation on the different Bitcoin Clients available to be used. It outlines the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of each one so you can make an informed decision.<br /><br />This is a clearnet link -&nbsp; https://bitinnovate.com/need-a-wallet/<br /><br />&nbsp;:) :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see your point. I think I&#039;ll follow your advice and get Electrum as an added layer of security; however, I don&#039;t store anything in my SR wallet. When I&#039;m ready to buy something, I transfer in the appropriate number of bitcoins and immediately place my order.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wadozo &amp; Iris haven&#039;t pointed out any dangers in withdrawing bitcoins from Mt. Gox directly to SR; however, adding another one or two wallets in between couldn&#039;t hurt. I haven&#039;t had any issues, although it&#039;s always nice to hear from the experts.

				There are lots of options when it comes to buying bitcoins. BitInstant to Mt. Gox is one route, although you can now purchase coins through BitInstant and transfer them directly to Silk Road, skipping Mt. Gox altogether ... but that&#039;s probably not a great idea. They&#039;ve been updating BitInstant--it&#039;s down at the moment--and you now have to register and verify your identity. Mt. Gox is still anonymous as long as you&#039;re not trading large amounts of cash.<br /><br />If you want to avoid BitInstant for whatever reason, here are some alternatives:<br /><br />--&nbsp; http://tradebitcoin.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />--&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally.<br />--&nbsp; https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Link your bank account and buy bitcoins online. Instant transfers after verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://www.nanaimogold.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Similar to BitInstant. Use MoneyGram &amp; Western Union to fund account.<br /><br />No matter what you do, you lose some or all of your anonymity when buying coins; therefore, you should &quot;launder&quot; them.<br /><br />Here are some sites to route your coins through before depositing them at Silk Road:<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://mtgox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet<br />--&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet<br />--&nbsp; https://easywallet.org/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet<br />--&nbsp; http://ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion/&nbsp; --&nbsp; OnionWallet. Anonymous eWallet, also launders bitcoins.<br />--&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinfog.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Launders bitcoins.<br /><br />After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, I suggest sending them through BlockChain, EasyWallet, and then OnionWallet. From there, send them to Silk Road. Also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address for every transaction. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance? Recently, an SR vendor was busted and had his coins confiscated because authorities were able to trace his transactions.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay<br /><br />*** IMPORTANT UPDATE ***<br /><br />Do not use OnionWallet (http://ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion/)--it is a SCAM. I transferred a small amount of money in there and it was immediately stolen. The entire website, as legit as it looks, is bogus. After the theft occurred, I did some research and found out that this has happened to a lot of people.<br /><br />*** OnionWallet is a SCAM ***

				There is one in the other forums...if you&#039;re in the U.S. I am seeing a lot about *CLEARNET* localbitcoin.com. I personally have not tried them, nor gotten a btc in some time. My last time was with bitinstant and they&#039;re fubar now. There is also Campbx. Get your 50 posts so you can read up on more alternatives.

When I opened my account with Mt. Gox, there was no need to verify it unless I wanted to trade BIG money--for an average consumer, an unverified/anonymous account was more than adequate. But guess what? The account was never REALLY anonymous, because you can only access Mt. Gox with a normal web browser; using Tor will freeze your account. So ... your actual IP address is out there. My account is still unverified, but only because I opened it prior to their new regulations. As far as I know, ALL new accounts must be verified.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The same holds true for BitInstant. It used to be &quot;anonymous&quot; in a flimsy sense; however, now you must register and verify your identity to use the service.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Well ... big fucking deal. There&#039;s plenty of good clearnet services out there for buying and selling bitcoins--which is NOT illegal, by the way--and using PayPal or a credit card online is certainly more convenient than driving to Wal-Mart and sending a MoneyGram.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The fact is, there are LOTS of ways to get coins.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;You want anonymous? Try https://localbitcoins.com/<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Basically, you buy bitcoins from a local person with cash. For many folks, this is the preferred method--and yes, it works well. Meet the guy in a parking lot, give him cash, and he releases coins to your account. Go to the site for details. It&#039;s very simple.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;So ... if you buy bitcoins using your own identity, how do you get them to Silk Road? Send them through a couple of anonymous Tor wallets:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;https://blockchain.info/<br />&nbsp;https://easywallet.org/<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Bitcoin Fog &quot;launders&quot; coins--it is a tumbler. It has mixed reviews. Take a look: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;But guess what? Silk Road itself tumbles/launders coins. Get a new address every time you make a transaction or deposit money for added security. If you buy bitcoins with a verified account, by the time you route them through several untraceable wallets and into Silk Road&#039;s labyrinth, no one will be the wiser. That&#039;s why it works so well.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Anyway, go back and read the original post again. Many updates have been added recently.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;--Dr. Jay

When buying coins, pretend that you&#039;re a day trader and not a customer on Silk Road--that ought to set your mind at ease. Launder your coins by routing them through several wallets before SR, which is itself a tumbler. Read DPR&#039;s guide. You&#039;re fine.

Use your Tor browser to go to http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/. After signing up, use this new email address to generate a new key pair (public &amp; private) for yourself. You give your public key to other people and they use that to encrypt messages to you. Never give out your private key or password--and make sure you use a STRONG password. Set your key to the max--4096 bits.

If you do, how will anyone use it to encrypt a message to you?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;To send a message to someone, you copy their public key to the PGP clipboard or save it in a text file; then, use the &quot;import&quot; function to add them to your keyring. Once you do this, their name will appear to the right of your clipboard with a check box. Write your message on the clipboard, select/check whoever you want to be able to read the message, press &quot;encrypt.&quot; Now you will have a PGP message that you can copy into an email or PM or whatever. When the recipient gets it, he/she copies it to their clipboard, presses &quot;decrypt,&quot; enters their password, and it is translated back into English. Only those who are selected can decrypt the message. It&#039;s always a good idea to add yourself as a recipient so you can go back and read stuff. If you&#039;re going to save messages, save them in their encrypted form. Use a STRONG password, don&#039;t share it, and don&#039;t store it anywhere.

				Does it really matter? Everyone thought Tormail was safe because it was a hidden service email server, but all those emails are probably in the hands of the FBI now. You might as well use any clearnet email provider, as long as you can register over Tor and only use the the service over Tor, and PGP encrypt all emails, you will be no worse off than everyone who used Tormail.

Installing Tor and PGP and learning how to use them is simple and free. Once you&#039;re online--which you are--everything can be done from home. Buy bitcoins, transfer them through a couple of anonymous wallets, deposit them at SR. Place your orders and wait. I placed five orders today and they&#039;ll start arriving within a day or two. What could be easier? It&#039;s as easy as shopping on Amazon.<br /><br />As for getting scammed, just do your homework in these forums a little bit. Scams are routinely exposed for everyone to see. I&#039;ve only been ripped off once in the last year (for a small amount of money) and I blame myself. I transferred some bitcoins to a bogus laundering service, TorWallet, without researching them first. My dough disappeared and that was it; however, had I looked before I leaped, it never would have happened.<br /><br />I try to do my best to offer safe, simple methods for using Silk Road. I&#039;m always open to constructive criticism and I love to learn new ways of doing things.<br /><br />Anyway, complete a few transactions before giving up. Once you get the hang of it, you can place an order within minutes without ever leaving your desk--and if you read the forums to find the hot sellers, you&#039;ll be paying low prices and receiving fire gear.

You&#039;re going to send them through a couple of anonymous eWallets, anyway--blockchain.info &amp; easywallet.org are good examples--and then you&#039;re going to transfer them to a fresh address at Silk Road, which is constantly being tumbled. Once the funds are there, request a new SR address; after making your purchase, change your SR address again.<br /><br />Etc.<br /><br />Believe it or not, there is virtually no chance that some government spook is looking over your shoulder as you send away for that fifty-dollar bag of dope.<br /><br />Go ahead. Knock yourself out.

When transferring bitcoins between wallets, you can monitor the transaction by copying one of the wallet addresses and entering it on the homepage of blockchain.info. If you&#039;re transferring between two easywallets, it is instantaneous and there are no fees. For me, it takes several hours to buy the coins and filter them through several wallets before having them show up at Silk Road.

				Cheers for all the info.<br /><br />I&#039;m only just getting started but I&#039;m really keen to make my first purchase, and want to make sure I&#039;ve followed all the right steps and am using the right programs/sites.<br /><br />From what&nbsp; I have gathered so far, I need to be using Tor for everything, which I have been doing. I&#039;ll be using spendbitcoins.com and my local bank to make a cash deposit, and have the bitcoins put in my blockchain.info wallet, which was setup using an anonymous email. I can then choose to &quot;Launder&quot; the bitcoins through a few wallets to make it harder to trace back to me. Then I would need to deposit the bitcoins to my SR account. Once I have arranged my purchase, I&#039;ll need to send my Public key and encrypted message that includes delivery details to the seller. I will be using btcrow.com for the deposit of bitcoins, and will release the bitcoins to the seller once I have received the delivery.<br /><br />Very brief but am I getting everything here? Have I missed any steps? I&#039;ll keep doing my research as I only recently started but hopefully I can make a purchase soon!<br /><br />Thanks :)

Just use 2 - 3 anonymous, torified wallets between where you purchase your bitcoins and Silk Road; also, get a new SR wallet address before/after every deposit, transaction, etc. You should be constantly changing it. As for escrow, that&#039;s all built right in to SR. When you place an order, it will be &quot;processing&quot;; when it ships, it will be &quot;in transit&quot;; when it arrives and you&#039;re satisfied, you will click on &quot;finalize,&quot; thus releasing funds. Leave good reviews, always be fair, never scam, work out issues with the vendors before going to SR or the forums. Protect your stats.

				Hi am fairly new to silk road and am so glad I found this thread its been helping me a lot. Its hard because you just want to get it over with and buy stuff but this is all important safety measures to go through. Anyways am still a bit confused about how to go about buying things so i use GPG to contact the seller but how should I send it? do I initially send my public key then communicate after?

				Hey,<br /><br />This thread is just what I needed. Registered a while ago but not looking into it properly until recently, so pretty new to this and been frying my head the last couple of days trying to sort out everything I need to do.<br /><br />So I have an SR account, have an anonymous email account with bitmessage. Registered with localbitcoins.com, which I can use my regular every day email with right?<br /><br />So doing everything through tor, buy bit coins, send em through a few wallets, deposit in new wallet on SR, order away? Just read on here about PGP. Is this important? What&#039;s the best way to sort this?<br /><br />Thanks for all the great info so far dudes :)

				Using PGP encryption is not necessary; however, it is STRONGLY recommended. When you place an order and send your address to the vendor, it is encrypted by Silk Road ... but if it is ever intercepted (anything is possible), having another layer of encryption (PGP) will prevent LE from being able to tie your name &amp; address to a felonious transaction.<br /><br />Also, all emails and private messages should be encrypted using PGP, especially if they contain sensitive info. When Tormail was compromised, many were left wondering how much of their correspondence could be viewed by LE.<br /><br />Some? None? All?<br /><br />For those of us who encrypted everything ... well ... this wasn&#039;t a question worth pondering. I assume that everything is up for grabs, sooner or later. It pays to be cautious; however, small-time consumers are really not targets anyway. If you make it easy enough, LE might make an example of you ... but honestly, you have nothing to offer them and the cost associated with pursuing charges is simply too high.<br /><br />Vendors? Yeah.<br /><br />DPR and the gang? You bet.<br /><br />Lil ol&#039; me? Doubt it.<br /><br />--Dr. Jay
