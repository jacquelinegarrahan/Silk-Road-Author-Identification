				My love began with a box.<br />Then it blossomed into a smaller, magical box of flight.<br />Then I became a jedi with the lifesaber.<br />And then I found the wonderful world of pens (microG).<br />Currently looking at a Puffit. cool concept.<br />MFLB &amp; microG come with my highest 9lol) recommendations!

				Overall I&#039;d say the MFLB. Especially since I acquired the concentrate tray attachements. the microG is a close second though. I&#039;m pretty stoked about the Puffit though. Small hand vape cleverly disguised as a inhaler

				I&#039;m based in the UK, but I&#039;m a huge fan of vaporisers. Specifically, the Magic Flight Launch Box. I vape or eat edibles exclusively, no smoking for me! I highly recommend the MFLB and all of their accessory products. The customer service is fantastic (even internationally!) and they really do stick to their word in regards to their warranty - they even replace your box if you somehow accidentally break it! They are a fantastic company and I&#039;ve had nothing but positive experiences with them. Not only that, but their products are very high quality and well made, I actually enjoy the feeling of holding the box, seeing some beautiful light and fluffy green slowly brown as I take hits, it&#039;s even better to watch concentrates bubbling away in there! It&#039;s a pleasure to clean, too.<br /><br />Personally, I use mine nearly daily, usually with my bong, the water pipe whip attachment and the power adapter. The wooden grinder they sell macerates the bud to a really fine grind which greatly improves the hits. The concentrate trays are just amazing and clean up very easily with a torch lighter. I love vaping BHO, honeycomb and oils with mine.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				i own a extreme q 4.0, a off brand wood purpledays ripoff, a launch box, and an omicron 2.5<br /><br />The omicron has replaced them all, but i do love my launch box. I retired it to occasional mapacho vaping, and cannabis whem i have bud/can&#039;t or dont want to make oil. I still love it, but the omicron is soo fucking awesome. Batteries and carts last way longer. Carts monthly, batteries i charge weekly (6x 14650&#039;s). Solid hits through my glass with 3.0ohm carts. <br /><br />It really is a fantastic vaporizer.

Personally I think the wooden Magic Flight grinder gives a much better grind than the Sharpstone, very small, light and fluffy, almost like powder. The fine consistency definitely improves vapor hits significantly.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
