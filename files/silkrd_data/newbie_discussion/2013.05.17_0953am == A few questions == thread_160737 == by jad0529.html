				Hi. I&#039;m new here, I would have posted in the specific forum but I don&#039;t have the ability to yet.<br /><br />I have a question about shipping, whats a relatively safe amount to get shipped. No I&#039;m not in need of something ridiculous like 30 grams. I&#039;m talking 3 ish maybe 5 in one delivery tops, would it be safer making two orders of 2/2.5 grams? I&#039;ll be ordering from a vendor in UK so it won&#039;t be crossing any borders and I&#039;ve known people working at the Royal Mail and I heard it&#039;s unlikely that anything would get caught, weed is likely to get caught for the smell but I&#039;m not interested in that.<br /><br />My second question is what are the reputable sellers of Ketamine and Mephedrone in the UK, I can see from the feedback on the silk road that a couple have caught my eye, but I&#039;m not completely sure yet (this is my first order). Ideally I&#039;d like to be buying off someone that takes the time to really package things well in order that they don&#039;t get caught. Does anyone have any recommendations?<br /><br />PS. If you&#039;re flaming about Mephedrone use, not interested in hearing it.

With UK to UK orders you should be fine even on bigger amounts because its very unlikely that the letter will ever be checked so i wouldn&#039;t worry about making 2 2.5 orders just go straight with what ever weight you want!<br /><br />I cant help with the Mephedrone but for the K i would recommend project4 or subtickle, I have used both and both have been very good and product is good as well!

				Orders of up to 100g, with the proper stealth and packaging techniques employed, will work in a single envelope of typical business size.<br /><br />As for the K vendor question, there are lots of reputable sellers out of the UK, with great prices to boot. Personally ive not dealt with any of the UK vendors. I can however suggest Subtickle, for i order mdma from them all the time, and their packaging is very good. Much love .

				For ketamine, you should go with Marcel Ketman, he&#039;s the most reliable K seller on SR. He ships from Germany at the moment though, but he should ship from the UK soon I think.

				This is good news about the UK to UK orders being relatively safe. I feel more confident in making a 5g order now. As for the Ketamine thanks for the responses, I&#039;ll be sure to look them up, whats the shipping like between countries in Europe, like say Germany to UK?

Just an educated guess.

				Getting stuff from two countries of the EU is pretty easy.. Customs don&#039;t really inspect things because of the Schengen agreement, so you&#039;re usually pretty safe ordering from another EU country, I&#039;d be a little more wary of the Netherlands but that&#039;s it..

				Thanks for the info guys. I&#039;m looking at Reich now, looks like a good seller, reasonably priced. Doesn&#039;t need a FE, which is good stuff. I can see myself making an order here soon.&nbsp; :)

				No problem dude. Reich would be a wise choice indeed.
