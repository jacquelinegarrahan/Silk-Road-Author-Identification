				Can someone tell me the cross tolerance between Ecstacy, LSD, Shrooms, DMT, and Mescaline<br /><br />I never knew you couldn&#039;t do Shrooms and LSD back to back with diminished tolerance...thank God I thought of this before my shrooms arrive this week.<br /><br />What about ecstacy, DMT and mescaline?&nbsp; How do all of these 5 drugs interact?&nbsp; Any information you would like to add to the topic of cross-tolerance would be appreciated as I&#039;m going to have Acid, shrooms, molly and DMT all at the same time and wondering how I should take it all.&nbsp; And don&#039;t tell me &quot;YOU SHOULD WAIT A MONTH BETWEEN TRIPS BECAUSE IT&#039;S BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN&quot;...I don&#039;t want to hear that.&nbsp; I&#039;m just wondering about tolerance of it all. Thanks a lot.

				I can&#039;t speak for the drugs you listed as I&#039;ve never combined them or heard of someone doing so, but something that might be of interest: I once had one or two of those legal high pills, having nothing &quot;real&quot; to take and passing by a head shop. For a bunch of herbs in a gel cap, it was surprisingly good. Anyway, someone came around with salvia, which I smoked a good bowl of, and the trip was WAY longer. It wasn&#039;t super strong but had that distinct distortion of spatial awareness. After a few minutes when everyone else had pretty much returned to baseline, I was still rocking side to side and mumbling. I have no idea what the herbal mix was, but it obviously prolonged (but not amplified) the effect of sally... odd.<br /><br />MDMA obviously interacts with serotonin and that whole hormonal system in a big way, but I think acid does too, to some extent. That might mean the receptors being over-stimulated, but I don&#039;t know enough about neurochemistry to say if that would affect tolerance...

				cleartext link AND a pdf - hxxp://www.maps.org/research/cluster/psilo-lsd/cns-neuroscience+therapeutics_2008-passie.pdf<br />viewer - http://view.samurajdata.se/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There is partial cross-tolerance (depending on whether LSD is given first or second) among LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin [168â€“170]. The most complete cross- tolerance is to mescaline in LSD-tolerant subjects. One study suggested that one-way cross-tolerance from LSD to DMT does not occur [171]. Studies with delta-9- tetrahydrocannabiol (THC) in subjects tolerant to LSD did not demonstrate a cross-tolerance between these drugs [172,173]. There is no cross-tolerance between LSD and amphetamine [169]. See Wyatt et al. [174] and Hintzen [50] for a complete review of tolerance and cross-tolerance studies with LSD.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Hintzen/Passie book referenced in that quote (50) can be found online, &quot;The Pharmacology of LSD: A Critical Review.&quot;<br />You want page 81, or search within for &quot;Tolerance and cross-tolerance&quot; and/or &quot;table 2.13&quot;.<br /><br />hope that helps<br /><br />Iris<br />
