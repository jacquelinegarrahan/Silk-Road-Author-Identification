				So I bought some bitcoins earlier today, getting ready for my first order on SR. I had the bitcoins sent to a wallet outside of SR, and everything went fine. I had my bitcoins within a matter of seconds after making the purchase.<br />I then went on to send the bitcoins to my SR account, triple checking that I had the right address. It took around 10 minutes before the transaction was confirmed, but an hour later, I still haven&#039;t seen any deposits to my SR Wallet. So I guess the question is, how long should it take before I should be seeing a deposit coming in?

				Yeah, it takes a while. I like to do my deposits during a time when I have stuff going on (going to bed, work, errands, etc) so that I don&#039;t have time to get paranoid.

				As others have already stated, it usually takes at least 6-7 confirmations, or 1-2 hours.&nbsp; Now, there are times when things slow down and it takes even longer, but that is why on your SR account page under your deposit address, it states that it can take &quot;several hours&quot; to receive.

				It was actually only after my first deposit came through, that, that message popped up. Before the bitcoins came through, all it said there was my bitcoin address here on SR. It only ended up taking around 3 hours though, and although I didn&#039;t really have anything else to do meanwhile, the forum post replies calmed me down. My first order&#039;s been made, and for the first time in years, I have a sense of the Christmas spirit, lol. As excited as I am about the product, I think I might even be more excited to see the packaging:)
