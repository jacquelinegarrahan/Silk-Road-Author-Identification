				yea some people get really mad when newbies ask really obvious questions that are already in the forums and give out negative karma to pppl.<br />I personally think its stupid that anybody who is able to give karma (has over 100 posts) is still in the newbie section of the forums giving out negative karma to ppl for trolling or asking newbie q&#039;s but to each his own..

				only thing I can THINK of is I just helped someone out who was using the fake SR addy to sing in..I had the same issue..had to listen for audio capcha to sing in while I was using the one with &quot;.to&quot; in front of the &quot;onion&quot; in the url..there should be a sticky abut it, because that seems to be the first noticeable thing for a newbie<br />~PB2k

				Is there some way to see at least what post gets you a -1? I have -2 now, one I&#039;m pretty sure is from posting in a spam thread but the other one is from today.

				No there is no way to see which post gave it to you but hey dont take the karma thing so seriously, i mean like DPR himself has -karma, so it just goes to show you that there are assholes on this site that give everyone -karma. and by the way once you hit 50 posts, theres a +karma thread you can post in and people in the thread give you +karma just for posting in there
