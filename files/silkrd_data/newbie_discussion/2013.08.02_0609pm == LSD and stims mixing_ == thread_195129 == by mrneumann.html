				Anyone ever done anything like this? I would like to hear general stories but I also have a rather specific question.<br /><br />So I took a 60mg vyvanse around an hour ago to clean my house from a large party thrown recently (Thanks to the Queen&#039;s Ketamine for making it interesting!) Now in 3 hours (4 from vyvanse drop) I have the absolutely perfect chance to take real LSD from another vendor on the road, so its not NBOMe. Now would this be an unwise idea? I have a perfectly healthy heart and can confirm this acid is not an RC. And I dont often have heavy stim comedowns that I cant handle. I will be able to handle myself on this comedown as long as I dont try to fall asleep and suffer insomnia (probably won&#039;t happen when I&#039;m on LSD too.) So what does the Road think? Sorry for asking, I really sound like a beginner but I promise I am taking the LSD for spiritual as well as recreational uses. I just have an absolutely perfect night and I feel that I am ready to take a psychedelic now that I have no worries on my mind other than the vyvanse.<br />Also sorry to type so much; Im stimmed right now.

				i agree. lsd + mdma is the best known state of mind for me. pure extatic pleasure. i remember after 200mg + 200 ug i cried when i saw my cat and thinking that it is so beautiful (normally i hate that peace of shit :D )

I know mixing isnt good thats why I was having second thoughts. I would absolutely love to lsd and mdma some day, from what I hear it is absolutely beautiful. Ive had them both seperate and I think I can imagine how blissful they would be together. Im still dropping tonight, in 1 hour, and I will update tomorrow or when I remember. Maybe I&#039;ll open a thread in harm reduction on mixing psys and stims. And you said mushrooms + amphetamines work well together? Ill have to look into that too I guess. Thanks again!

				I don&#039;t have too much experience, but the one time I mixed NBOMe with 20mg of meth, I was more paranoid and agitated than a serial killer on the run, and was shaking like a motherfucker, almost as if I was oscillating, and felt a disconnect from the world around me in the worst way possible. Then I discovered just how potent of a stim NBOMe is by itself.
