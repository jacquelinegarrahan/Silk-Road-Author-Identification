				Overall, I am very satisfied with my order! This was my first purchase of marijuana on SR, so I was a little nervous to order something so voluminous and detectable (have previously dealt mostly with LSD paper and small quantities of psych powders).<br /><br />Shipping: Placed order on Tuesday around 5pm EST, made it from California to New York by Saturday. Pretty damn fast! Package was small and very discreet. Addresses printed on labels. I&#039;m pretty sure he spelled my name wrong, which is kind of a shame. I need to check my original message to see if I did that by accident, but I don&#039;t think I did (I&#039;ve had years of practice spelling my own name, have it pretty down pat ;) ). Could have caused a problem, but I still received my package without issue.<br /><br />Customer service: Excellent! Fast and friendly communication. Very generous, too. I told him I&#039;d take some pics of his product, so he threw in a 1.6g nice bit of his Medical Purple Urkle for me. That was a special treat. Bud had nice purple tinges and that nice pine-y purple smell. Smoked very nicely and truly felt medical! I was cured!<br /><br />The 1 ounce of shake is nice, too. I was a little disappointed since I had heard some others who received say that it was &quot;more like commercial bud than trim&quot;. I&#039;m not sure what they meant by &quot;commercial bud&quot;, but it was pretty leafy in my opinion. There was definitely a solid about of bud fragments interspersed--I&#039;d guess maybe a third of it was straight bud, and I&#039;d compare the fragments that were there to commercial bud. Not an overwhelming amount of stems. I was honestly a little disappointed with that because I&#039;ve been collecting stems to make infused vodka, but it&#039;s good to have more to smoke!<br /><br />For my purposes, the shake works pretty well. I chopped it all up to distribute the bud bits amongst the leaves and make a homogenized smoking mix. It smells and feels very &#039;70s grass. It tastes a little off because of the leaves, but it gets me pretty high! The high itself is pretty interesting. I really think I feel the mixed effects of different cannibinoid ratios in the various strains that went into this stuff...or maybe I&#039;m just high :) <br /><br />Would order again! Good, cheap smoke for the non-connoisseur on a budget.

				It seems like all of the trim ever posted on the road is just people garbage that they would normally not even use for edibles. Tired of getting garbage yield off of trim vendor after trim vendor

				With all the people selling quality bud, you would think that there would be more vendors offering equal quality trim. No, many vendors are taking advantage of the SR system and just sending stuff with basically no trichomes, no thc, no cbd, nothing except whatever garbage got collected in their trim sitting around the house.

				Sorry if I sound like just a sour customer, but the only reason I started making my own BHO is because I ordered wax order after wax order from about 10 vendors on the road. I got DECENT wax about 3 out of the 10 times. The other times I got butane filled, sappy, crap. That stuff hurts people and gives all the haters against the road arguing points. THe road should not just be a place for leftovers and the unwanted crap. It should be viewed as what it is, a place where customers can get a quality product at a quality price. Getting pretty far from that.

				Trichome coverage is pretty good. Leaves my fingers feeling sticky if I run my hands through. As I said, it gets me pretty high just smoking it by itself. Comparable to mids, but not as good as top shelf stuff obviously. You should look at California Dreaming&#039;s trim. It looks stronger than most stuff, but I didn&#039;t buy it because I wanted to smoke the trim and his is supposedly as fine or finer than kief.<br /><br />Good luck! You seem justifiably mad if you haven&#039;t found the object of your desires on SR.

				Just curious, as I might order some trim soon, how much of tommychongs trim did you smoke to get a good high?

				Thanks for the reply SonarJapan. Yeah i&#039;ve looked at trim listings quite frequently but can&#039;t seem to find anything or anyone for that matter with consistent and good trim. Getting discouraged, havn&#039;t received order from Tommy Chong yet, but I will update when I do. I&#039;m just looking for something to run some nice bho and get a nice yield ya know?
