				What kind of underground shit would you say is cool? They forbid weapons, assassinations, child porn and anything that is intended to harm. I wouldn&#039;t pass judgement on your views of any of the above, but what other underground stuff is there except drugs that is cool?

				Other than this place, the infamous pedo sites and tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorists, I think HackBB is one of the most famous sites on Tor. <br /><br />Probably worth a look if you&#039;re interested in how credit card fraud works.

				Pretty much anything.&nbsp; TOR probably isn&#039;t enough if you&#039;re planning on CP (disgusting) if you care anything about exit node providers.&nbsp; <br /><br />For fun, you can troll clearnet boards.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they can permaban someone with a changing IP, as far as I know.&nbsp; There&#039;s probably some savvy ones that have a blocklist for all TOR exit nodes

				I think being able to freely discuss political views without worrying if the &quot;man&quot; is going to bust down your door is a great thing (assuming you haven&#039;t been reckless in regards to giving out other identifying info out publicly) &amp; as the previous poster said learning shit they don&#039;t want you to know<br /><br />But torrents + tor is a big no no..<br /><br />CP is disgusting incidentally too<br /><br />well thats my thoughts anyway
