				I don&#039;t know where these guys are getting their supply but i usually buy adderall for about 3-5 bucks a pill the cheapest i can find on SR is about 15 a pill which is ridiculous. A couple vendors are even selling 15 pills for upwards of 400$ what... a... fucking... RIP OFF! these types of pills should be no more than 10 bucks a pill, even with the risk of shipping them via the mail. so just wondering if anyone knows of any good cheaper vendors.

				Sorry, but I wish. Any drugs that are USA CSA Schedule II (and often just as if not more than restrictive by UN equivalent) drugs are going to be massively inflated in price. <br /><br />This is why I use MDPV. Thanks to news media bullshit about morons snorting 200mg doses of it at a time (its a substance that a person with no tolerance would get a hard kick with just 5mg...) and then the drug itself is blamed for all the psychotic behavior and whatnot. But it does cause paranoia easier for me. But thanks to the controlled substance act inflating the cost of safer drugs (amphetamines) I buy whatever potent psychostimulant that doesnt boost serotonin I can. Oh and MDPV is Schedule I, but since theres a lot of fear even among educated drug users surrounding it, its cheap because supply drastically exceeds demand. <br /><br />If using MDPV, be sure to weigh it or maybe arrange to pay extra and arrange a vendor to weigh out 5mg doses and sell gelcaps or whatnot (btw vendors of potent powders, theres a money maker opportunity... ;) ) <br /><br />I have considered trying those icky looking amphetamine pastes.... hmmmm. <br /><br />If you are using stims for therapeutic purposes, try one of the unscheduled modafinil analogs -- its not going to be anywhere near as euphoric but for some it replaces the stronger / more expensive stuff for medicinal use. <br /><br />I must stress this.. .MDPV is a fucking STRONG psychostimulant. Yes, the media spread some bullshit, but you need to weigh it out atleast at first if you lack a tolerance. Use SMALL doses of Clonidine for no longer than 2 days a week (because its a blood pressure drug, and you become physically dependent on those with prolonged dosing) and keep a benzo nearby (same physical dependency, along with psych disclaimer).<br /><br />There are two main groups of psychostimulants: entactogens and NDRIs. MDMA [Ecstasy] is an example of an entactogen -- bad for repeated daily use, aggravates distraction/focus issues doesnt counter them. NDRIs are the focus do-boring-shit-for-20-hours-and-like-it drugs which are more suited for longterm daily use because most of them do not deplete serotonin (which is slow to replenish, unlike dopamine) and encourage work vs encouraging random fucking around that entactogens do. lol.<br /><br />Good luck. But dont blame the vendors for the prices, blame the controlled substance act and related treaties for inflating their price. Heroin was cheaper than beer when it was unregulated, same with Benzedrine / Methedrine (amphetamines sold OTC once upon a time).

				I am selling adderall for a decent price. The reason we have to charge more is that you are probably on insurance or whoever you buy from is, so they make pure profit. We have to pay cash for the medicine and then push it off....let me know if you have anymore questions

				I am new to SR and was wondering why Addys are so expensive.&nbsp; It&#039;s rediculous.&nbsp; I know that no one is forcing me to get them through this site and the market prices are a result of demand and what not, but these are not expensive to get in the US nor is it hard to get a Dr. to prescribe ADHD meds.&nbsp; Anyone have any insight as to why the markup is so high?&nbsp; Benzos are cheap as hell.&nbsp; These on the other hand...way high.&nbsp; I am trying to network and familiarize myself with SR, so any replies are welcome and appreciated.<br />
