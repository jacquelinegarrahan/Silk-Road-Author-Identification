				Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering how a &#039;Flagged&#039; address works? I&#039;m baffled to understand how Customs can monitor and track every bit of international post to know if an address if &#039;Flagged&#039;..<br /><br />Anyone&#039;s information on this would be informative.<br /><br />WI

				Hi WI, I can only give you an Australian&#039;s perspective, hope that helps. Customs is first line defense, they target suspicious packages and what not. When they find suspicious items they may send you a warning letter or they may hand it over to the police. It is the police, in conjunction with the postal service, that &quot;flag&quot; your address. All the mail you receive is funneled through successively smaller sorting areas, one of which deals with your local suburb, town, area and it is there that your mail is easily monitored.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In Australia an individual&#039;s postal rights are highly protected. It takes some effort to get an address flagged. Sometimes the police skip this step by asking for search warrants directly off the evidence found by customs. This is why it is smart to keep a clean house when expecting any packages.

				+1 to Aussie bob. Very interesting, does anyone have any idea how easy it is for the law to flag you in the UK?<br />I never order enough to warrant further action, I&#039;m just paranoid!

				Im guessing when customs find it, your address is inputted into a computer at the post automatic assortment center, once something pops up going to that address it is inspected to check for more drugs<br /><br />Also, they dont send you a notice sometimes (e.g: Australia) so that you can order more and they can build up a case and fuck your life<br /><br />Im not 100% sure of this but it definitely makes sense to me, they cant sit their looking for your mail all the time, its all automatically done<br /><br />Never have more than one item in transit to one address, say you have 3 in transit and the first one is seized, they flag address and get the other 2 on their way<br /><br />&nbsp;

				1. Shipments to aliases like &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; on the address. You should always use your real name unless you managed to rent a post box with a falsified ID<br /><br />2. Vendors not properly packing the contents, and a dog indicating scent on your article<br /><br />3. Xrays showing powders or plant material (again, vendors who properly pack stuff innoculate this)<br /><br />The only country that has some frightening drug detection schemes is the United Arab Emirates. They spend billions a year on R&amp;D for even detecting tiny personal amounts of drugs being sent through their systems. Thankfully, US at least has not yet bougt any of their laser based devices that can identity down to the molecule whats inside an envelope. They do not fuck around. <br /><br />Look at a vendor&#039;s feedback and look for mentions of if he/she vacuum seals or not, and how innocuous the outside envelope looks. For instance an envelope with a shakily written address with a sharpie pen and what feels like the seam of a sandwhich bag in the center isnt gonna look good. But ime customs people do a lot of slacking and fucking off on the job, unless they are the white horse crusader of &quot;justice&quot; type that delusionally believes that drug users must be locked up to save them from hell. Most of those moved to the United Arab Emirates. lol. <br /><br />A good vendor will pack stuff so that a dog wont indicate (even if its the stinkiest of stinky cannabis) and xray wont show anything to make the inspector care. <br /><br />Remember, those people are being laid off due to austerity budget cuts around the world or they are redirected to inspecting bulkier stuff for shit that actually matters: bombs, radiological devices, viral weapons, nerve agents, etc most of which isnt going to fit in a small envelope anyhow. Its bulkier shit that gets priority for the random inspection belt. It takes lots of money to train these dogs and a handler that is also well paid must supervise the dog. That shit is not cheap even for inspecting 0.1% of incoming mail. Only theocratical and totalitarian nations try to inspect high % of mail. An inspector who doesnt give a fuck about his/her job outnumbers the inspector who takes it seriously -- unless they are in the section thats looking for terrorist shit. I&#039;ve seen USPS inspectors playing world of warcraft while on the job once. And day by day another inspector is given a buyout, separation pay, or laid off outright, or moved to sorting mail or delivering it. Inspection of small items is privately seen by budget overseers as a waste of money, so they try to chop away as much as possible. <br /><br />Disclaimer - all this info is from a US perspective. I once lived in the UK, but not long enough to receive or send mail.

				If you want an idea of how ineffective their &#039;flagging&#039; really is have a good read through Shadh1&#039;s case<br />&nbsp;http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VCC/2013/70.html?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=silk%20road&nbsp; .<br />After being busted, charged with 11 seperate counts of importation, given the cops access to his silk road account and then released <br />on bail.&nbsp; He still received 2 more deliveries while he was awaiting trial (which he handed over to police).&nbsp; <br />Don&#039;t use your own name, don&#039;t use your own address, say &quot;no comment&quot; to everything no matter how silly it feels (As far as I know it is still untested in court<br />&nbsp;as to whether you actually even have to give them your name, unless it&#039;s a traffic stop) and never plead guilty.

				I provided the web address in the post and have post the full transcript on the Shadh1 but i&#039;ll put it here for you.&nbsp; It is from the <br />judges sentencing statement sourced from Austlii, a University run web site.&nbsp; Suprisingly I can&#039;t find a disclaimer removing their liability <br />if it contains any errors.&nbsp; Under Australian law any ruling by a judge becomes a part of the common law this info would not be published without them being very sure that it&#039;s accurate. <br /><br />Matters in mitigation: Plea of guilty<br /><br />22 On the plea your Counsel put in mitigation that you had entered an early plea of guilty. I accept that that plea has significant utilitarian value. It has saved the need for a committal, a trial, and the calling of witnesses. I give you full credit for an early plea of guilty. You have taken responsibility for your conduct, and have facilitated the course of justice.<br />23 Your plea is also evidence of significant remorse. Following your arrest and after your “no comment” record of interview, you did cooperate with the authorities, in that you did provide information to them as to how the&nbsp; Silk Road&nbsp; website operates, and in the use of the Tor software. In addition to that, you received two subsequent packages addressed to you after your arrest, and you forwarded them to the authorities. You also, in an email to the police on 26 October 2012, provided a phone number of your drug supplier as well as details of his registration number. That information was forwarded to Victoria Police but has not been taken further. This does not disentitle you from credit for your conduct. I give some weight to all those matters as cooperation with the authorities. I also see these matters as evidence of remorse, and they are relevant to your prospects of rehabilitation.
