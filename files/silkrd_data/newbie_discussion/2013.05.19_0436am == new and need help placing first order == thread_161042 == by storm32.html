				hey welcome to SR<br />when you log on to SR click on &quot;account&quot; at the top page near messages and orders. that page will give you an address to send your bitcoins. remember its good idea to change you passphrase and pin before you deposit money for security.<br />once you added your items to your cart there should be a message box available to leave your encrypted address in which will be sent when you purchase<br />

				On silk road, click account in the top of the page. On this page you will have a message saying &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address: &quot;.<br />With you random wallet, send whatever you want to this address, then wait about an hour to be able to see your coins on the website (time to confirm transaction, may be less, may be more).<br /><br />When you click &quot;add to cart&quot; on an item, on the next page you will have to select the postage and click &quot;go&quot; to confirm it. By that point you should encrypt your address and put it in the box saying &quot;Please enter your name and address<br />as it would be written on a letter:&quot;. Then put your PIN in the intended box, and &quot;place order&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Edit: Well, not fast enough...

				I&#039;m new here myself but here&#039;s just a couple of points i picked up.<br /><br />Never FE. Keep looking for a vendor who won&#039;t ask a newbie to FE or start of with a few small orders where you aren&#039;t required to FE to build up stats.<br /><br />Have separate public pgp keys for using on the forums and when you order.<br /><br />Read the vendor&#039;s page carefully and especially the feedback and be skeptical of anyone with too many 5/5&#039;s linked to FE&#039;s.<br /><br />Keep reading these forums for tips. The mods here Libertas, Scout and Pine are great and really helpful for giving tips to avoid falling into the usual newbie pitfalls and many of the other users are really good with advice as well.
