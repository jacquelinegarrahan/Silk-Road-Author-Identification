				Adderall is absolutely nothing like MDMA.<br />As far as I&#039;m concerned it&#039;s pretty much in a class of its own. Some RCs will get close to the effects but nothing is quite the same.

				definitely not adderall, although i like to have them together &lt;3<br /><br />methylone is somewhat similar...not nearly as awesome (imo) but decent substitute if you are taking a break from mdma &amp; if you know this is what you are taking (some assholes try to sell this to people expecting mdma)<br /><br />i&#039;ve heard one of the 2c&#039;s (maybe 2c-b?) is also somewhat similar but have unfortunately not tried this myself yet.<br /><br />nothing is quite the same though

				If you snort several lines of 4-MEC in a relatively short period of time (something like 2 or 3 hours) you&#039;ll get a feeling that is somewhat similar to MDMA.<br /><br />It&#039;s not as strong, but it&#039;s very very similar.<br />

				I would say LSA aka Morning Glory seeds or Hbwr seeds. Also they&#039;re not illegal so you can buy morning glory seeds on ebay or iamshaman. LSA isn&#039;t really the most popular drug because a lot of people don&#039;t like the nausea on the come up.

For me, Adderall causes intense euphoria, makes my dick rock hard, and intensifies sex (and also tactile sensations) unbelievably. I&#039;ve been taking it daily for a year and a half and I don&#039;t have ADHD. Maybe that&#039;s the difference?<br /><br />For me, Adderall is 10x more euphoric as opioids. That&#039;s the only reason I take it. It doesn&#039;t help me focus at all and turns me into a scatter-brained retard half the time.<br /><br />Adderall does increase the intensity of a marijuana high, but it&#039;s not going to cause visuals. If you&#039;re talking a light dose of molly or x, then weed and Adderall should be enough.<br /><br />If you&#039;re talking a high dose of mdma, then adderall and shrooms would do the trick (you can either add weed or not).<br /><br />When I get really tweaked, I ALMOST feel as if I were rollin&#039;. It&#039;s a similar feeling for me, but it&#039;s not the same.<br /><br />As I said in my original post, the MA in MDMA stands for methamphetamine. You need some type of stimulant to achieve those effects - some type of amphetamine would be better obviously.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not at all lecturing the person whose comment I&#039;ve quoted. I mean him/her no offense. I&#039;m just sharing an opinion from a different user&#039;s perspective. When it comes to the perception of the effects of a drug, everyone has a different experience.

				one the closest you will find to MDMA is 4-mmc (mephedrone)...and its not even that close in retrospect...much shorter roll, slight body-load, &quot;speedy&quot; sensation...the funny thing is that most all designer MDMA-like substances were, at one point, marketed as bath salts and available over the counter...HA...if you ever got sold &quot;A molly&quot; and its white powder, its most likely 4-mmc (mephedrone).&nbsp; easy to cap out, and you used to be able to buy it in bulk as &quot; plant feed&quot; over the clear web. i believe it was the #1 choice party drug in the UK for a good many years...callin&#039; that shit M-Cat....<br /><br />....and yo, stop recommending the 2c-? as a substitute for this user when they&#039;re literally asking if &quot;MDMA is similar to an Adderall&quot;.........cruel

				yeah some parts of adderall can be like rolling, the tingles, the dilated pupils... but you have to take a lot, like 60 mgs or more if u have no tolerance. any more than 80mgs would be really dangerous to take. I have a ridiculous script and a tolerance so i can take like 120 mgs in a sitting and get so zooted. <br /><br />Nothing is quite like mdma in terms of mood and emotion and enjoyment of movement..<br />When SR is back up im going to order some MDA, i hear its like a psychedelic molly :) really excited for that<br />

				MDA is fantastic, somewhat similar but more introspective (for me).&nbsp; It was more of a stay at home and party intimately versus ravin&#039; experience.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried 2C-B (am patiently waiting for the road to come back up... ).<br /><br />Am also curious to find out what other funtime goodies are similar to MDMA (it&#039;s my preferred type of high).

				Nothing I&#039;ve come across has even come close to real MDMA.<br />I did try MDAI once, as a sort of experiment. But yeah, it was garbage. lol<br /><br />imo good quality MDMA is a beautiful thing, never imitated.

				Methylone is similar to mdma but not quite there. Psychedelics are awesome mixed with mdma but nothing alone will give you the euphoria pure mdma does.
