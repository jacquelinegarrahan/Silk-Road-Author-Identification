				Hello everyone, ive been a quiet lurker on these forums and a occasional buyer on the road for almost a year now. and since i forgot all my login info for my old sr forums acct ( ancientx )<br />Im starting fresh here again.<br /><br />Well im starting this thread to hopefully provide and give a place for complete noobs to meth a good place to ask questions about meth and its use as well as ask about vendors and the purity and experience of their gear. im sure there is another thread like this in the forums in another section but i havent seen one here in newbies.<br /><br />So if you have questions, concerns, or have information to provide please feel free!<br />-AX<br />

				This is sort of the thread I&#039;ve been wanting. What exactly is your meth experience? While I am a noob to SR I am not a noob to meth. I&#039;ve started in 1990 but stopped in 2003 because things were getting crazy I was living with a relative who was a cook so I never did anything that was cut unless it cam from another source.<br /><br />The main meth vendor thread is truly disappointing with talk of CTM being the only source currently who has &quot;OK&quot; dope. Much discussion is also how there is no testing compared to some of the other drugs on the road. Also are accusations of people who really do not know good meth giving good reviews on heavily cut stuff and possible padding of reviews.<br /><br />What do you recommend for a first purchase for an old meth head who wants to relive the days of wanting to rewire the house but then get preoccupied with something else.<br /><br />I usually just smoke and really good shit will have you forget about needing a hit for hours.

				I&#039;m a noob to pretty much every drug. Tried meth for the first time a couple months ago. Have tried a few more times since. Maybe it&#039;s me, maybe it&#039;s the gear, but I don&#039;t get a &quot;high&quot;. I have sniffed and smoked. I seem to get a little more out of sniffing, but the burn is a bit too much for me if I don&#039;t get much for it. <br /><br />I do feel the stimulant part, like I drank 3 energy drinks. But definitely no euphoria or &quot;high&quot;. I&#039;ve tried a couple vendors just to make sure it wasn&#039;t the quality or particular batch. And I was with a seasoned meth user who seems to enjoy it just fine.<br /><br />Any suggestions? I&#039;m so disappointed. After a lifetime of hearing about how euphoric meth is and that its so addictive because of it, it&#039;s a bit of a let down.

				All the meth on SR right now is complete shit.<br /><br />ChiTownMafia is legit, ive ordered from him, and he has the best/cheapest gear on the road right now.<br /><br />But that being said, CTM&#039;s dope compared to older vendor&#039;s batches is complete shit.<br /><br />CTM&#039;s dope is obviously cut really bad, cause i ordered .25 sample from him, and yea it got me high, but i had to smoke nearly twice as much as normal to even get a little high. <br /><br />( and i have a low as fuck tolerance for this stuff, sooooo yea )<br /><br />You&#039;re better off buying adderall or amph paste or something if you want a good high.

				Before you take meth make sure you are a strong willed person or it will take hold quickly and tightly.<br />There is a lot of meth in my town and it has turned friends into junkies, just a warning. you can do what you like it is your body i am just warning you guys.

				I made an order from ChiTownMafia a few weeks ago, I had not done any meth for about 2 years. I am definitely not an expert on it, I used it moderately for a 9 month period. The stuff I used to get was rarely any good, a half gram would keep me up for a day, 2 at the most.<br />I got a half gram of ChiTown&#039;s, and he was having issues getting on to SR at the time. Long story short, I ended up canceling my order after 5 days, but he had sent my order before I canceled. I wrote him about it, and he said &#039;you can keep it, sall good, sorry for the delay, have fun.&#039; So I was really impressed by his professionalism.<br />The gear itself weighed .44 in the bag, and was 2 large shards and 10-15 smaller shards, no powder. A little underweight, but I the quality was total FIRE. It was ridiculously clear, and hard to break up. I railed it, and it was always 3-4 hours before I felt like another line. The stuff burned the hell initially, but after 15 minutes or so my nose was fine, I noticed with a lot of the stuff I used to rail my nose would be sore for days afterwords, mine nose was fine 15 minutes after my last line.<br />The high was great, very euphoric, not twitchy, really smooth. I could have stayed up for a week with this half gram, but I decided to do the last .2 or so after being up for 2 days, because I have no self control and I wanted to be done with it. I got really paranoid, but that was because of the way I chose to do it (not eat or sleep for 3 days), but was fine after a nice long 18 hour nap lol<br />Over all, I was really stoked with the transaction, Chi&#039;s communication was good, and I was super stoked that he ended up hooking me up for free. I&#039;ll never use anyone else for meth because he was so chill about it (not to mention the product was absolute FIRE (to this meth noob)).

				Good meth will give you a euphoric feeling. Coke always made me irritable and wanting more coke. First time on good meth and you are smart, sexy, funny and confident all rolled up into one. There is so much dopamine flowing in your brain..... why do you think it exploded all over the country in the late 90&#039;s early 2k. It would be easier for me to list the drugs I have not done, rather than the ones I have. and meth was always the best.<br /><br />There is nothing like your first time..<br /><br />Man I miss those days..... <br /><br />But if you use alot (I mean daily over a very long time) you will need it to just to get out of bed and feel normal. I used to do so much dope that I would get hungry after my morning bowl.

				Yeah, if they are large clear shards, they are supposed to be more pure. Versus powder or broken prices. However, the last batch I got were two beautiful large shards. I can&#039;t get a high to save my life from it and have been told it&#039;s not really meth. So....means nothing when they talk large clear shards...<br /><br />Another question, has anyone tried ayeseadee1080? I&#039;m keeping CTM in mind for next order though.
