				Hey SR Community,<br /><br />New here, just trying to get a feel for the place. <br /><br />I&#039;m based in Australia - and was suprised by reading the other forums that it seems like most shipments get through. Anyone had experience with stealth packed coke and can recommend a supplier? I&#039;d prefer quality over price.<br /><br />Anyways - I can get hold of MDPV pretty easily. I noticed that it was currently being sold at over $160 per 100mg in Australia.<br /><br />Is there any demand for this? I could beat that price. Also - is there any demand for MDPV packed into caps, potentially with custom MG amounts?<br /><br />Anyway - Hey!

				The demand for MDPV is pretty low in Australia, it has a very specific effects profile that doesn&#039;t lend itself to regular use, especially when other stimulants are available.
