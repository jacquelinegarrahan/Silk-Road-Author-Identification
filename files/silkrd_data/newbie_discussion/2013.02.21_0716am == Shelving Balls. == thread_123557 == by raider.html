				&nbsp;Just wondering if anyone has tried this?A mate was telling me about dripping liquid LSD on his balls and shelving them in his mate.Apart from tripping balls, is it a pain in the arse to carry him around?Probably better if you had a saggy sack and could shelve your own.

				I&#039;m with WatLanBoon: there&#039;s a few prudes, and a few unlucky fellows sleeping with prudes in this thread. Maybe I just have a freaky girlfriend, but she&#039;s frequently down for the brown pound. I get to go bareback on her ass, which is a treat because we use condoms the rest of the time.
