				It should take no longer than a day. Are you sure you entered the BTC address correctly? If so contact SR support.

That&#039;s a little ridiculous.&nbsp; I would research another method of depositing cash, just an idea.&nbsp; But, hope your stuff finds you, doing well.&nbsp; I also feel the need to point out that you have crossed the 50 post mark, you may post on the regular boards now if you like.&nbsp; :D 8)&nbsp; &nbsp; and GENGAR, there was an issue with SR last night, I would give it a day before freaking out too much... things are just a little hectic at the moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have a good one!

				Out of interest, how were you sending them to your SR address? I have personally never waited longer than a day for my funds to become available after sending them. You have to understand support will get lots of attempts at people scamming them.

				Yeah, I&#039;m losing like $5 an hour because of the little &quot;mini&quot;?-crash going on right now. I deposited about $80 worth of bitcoin into my account to buy something, and now - 10 confirmations later (according to blockexplorer.com) - it&#039;s worth about $70, and I&#039;m still waiting for SR to even acknowledge that I attempted a deposit. Nothing... nothing even says &quot;pending&quot;. Um, guys? This is kinda bullshit...<br /><br />Why can&#039;t I find any information about how many confirmations SR needs to complete a deposit? Seems like a rare piece of otherwise-up-front information..Don&#039;t understand why that isn&#039;t stated anywhere on the FAQ, Wiki, or *gasp* even the account page itself...<br /><br />edit: fuck my life. there&#039;s the deposit. Seriously though, the site *needs* to state how many confirmations are needed and what deposits are pending, that would smooth over a LOT of nervous rare users of the site like me... :/<br />edit: I am literally losing a dollar a minute. Wow.

				The number of confirmations needed is at least 6-7, but depending on how things are running, sometimes it takes longer.&nbsp; Stick around and you&#039;ll see that patience is a virtue.
