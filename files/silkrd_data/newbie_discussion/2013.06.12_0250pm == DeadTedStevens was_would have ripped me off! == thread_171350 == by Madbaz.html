				I never thought i would have to register as im not a forums fan<br /><br />but thought the community as a whole should be aware about this seller and the devious trick hes played on others and was about to play on me, soooooooooo glad i canceld the order as i was about to buy the same other thing from another vendor so thats two vendors on the scam.. <br /><br />not f***in happy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DeadTedStevens(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I canceled the order. Ill let you in on a little secret now. NONE of them work unless you REALLY REALLY REALLY know what you are doing. If you are buying these methods you don&#039;t. Remember what I said when you never get any of them to work ;) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />madbaz &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancel this please, i have found it alot cheaper else where.<br /><br />CANCEL ORDER<br /><br />Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br /><br /><br />not sure if he will reply or not.

				Did you really expect some sort of secret to fool the government to be sold publicly and not be available elsewhere?<br /><br />Roll your own man, using something from a book will get you pinched.

				I think its important that forum members post about scammers or bad experiences with other members and vendors.

				Maybe i should pm that vendor? i know i would be pissed if it was me...<br /><br />Description<br /><br />Also check out my guide with 7 cashout methods: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8614d18822<br /><br />Some fucking clown on here (namely, uketalar) is trying to sell this same information for $40. I find this completely obscene as it is publicly available. I&#039;ll gladly give it to you for less if you are having trouble finding it.<br /><br />PM me with any questions.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b0e46fcbd7<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:o
