				Hiya, I&#039;ve never been to a festival before, but I think I&#039;m ready,&nbsp; I like EDM/MDMA/K etc.. .&nbsp; I don&#039;t have anyone to go with at the moment, is it common for people to just turn up on there own?&nbsp; If I do, is it likely that I will meet some friendly people to party with? I was thinking of global gathering or cream fields any suggestions would be appreciated <br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks<br />Balish. UK

				it&#039;s more common to go with someone, but if you go by yourself, its not super unusual, and i highly doubt you wouldn&#039;t be able to find some friendly people to hang out with. people go to festivals for the environment and the experience, and for most, that includes meeting new people and trying new things. just keep a little extra cautious if you plan on using drugs in such a crowded place without anyone you know there; be very aware of dose, timing and setting. have an emergency plan for what you will do if something doesnt go as expected, like someone who you can call to pick you up reasonably quickly if you get heatsick or if anything bad happens.<br /><br />have fun. :) i&#039;m sorry i can&#039;t suggest a UK festival as i&#039;m in the US, but i&#039;ve always wanted to go to Allgood and Burning Man, myself. i&#039;m determined to experience burning man before i hit middle-age.
