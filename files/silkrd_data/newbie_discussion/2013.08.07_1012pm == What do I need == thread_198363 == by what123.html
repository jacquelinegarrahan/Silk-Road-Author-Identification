				Hi dude! Read some of the stickys in all of the forums, they will set you in the right direction. Find and download tor browser bundle, and you will be set! Just follow what the stickys say and be careful

				Get on Tor right now! You are putting yourself at risk if you neglect it. Juust search for Tor browser bundle, it&#039;s 1-click-run after install. Keep it on a USB or memcard<br /><br />FE is when you release you money from escrow (when SR is holding it) You should never do this; trust the escrow system until at least you can completely trust someone<br /><br />Also, use PGP encryption (it&#039;s simpler than you think!) for any compromising data like your address<br /><br />Here&#039;s a handy read to help you out

				After this post I&#039;ll start using Tor, Just tell me now how I can post. Everytime I try to post on Tor, tells me I have the wrong verification letters even though they&#039;re right. Only works off Tor, I&#039;m not doing anything incriminating here. I just came to talk at this random forum and nothing more.<br /><br />Also the stickies doesn&#039;t list links where to get gpg and pgp, I google&#039;d and many links pop up. What do I get, I rather ask someone here rather download from a fake site.

				You are making a lot of mistakes, You only need to make one mistake and you will end up in federal prison.<br /><br />My advice is smarten up, Read some tutorials watch some videos on youtube on how to use PGP and after you do all of that never ever log back into the account you are using now ever again, When you get on Tor make a NEW account and use it from now on, But ONLY USE IT WITHIN TOR.

				In the past, if I have taken &#039;too long&#039; to compose a message in the forum, it tells me that I am entering the wrong letters. I found that if I refresh the page, I am able to post again. Hope that helps.

				OP, you should consider EVERYTHING you do when not on TOR as being logged, monitored, and directly traceable to you by your ISP and the feds. We all know it&#039;s being done, especially with the recent revelations about the NSA and PRISM. My advice to you would be to just get the Tor Browser Bundle, and research for a few days on how you can further improve security from there. Look up the &#039;Tails&#039; operating system. Delete this thread. Ditch this account right now, log out and never log back in.
