			<dd class="postbody">
				Help! I am being tortured by tv-staticky sound coming out of my ears (it echos so its no neural problem) and a bunch of other things. Almost noone says anything. Going to other countries only helps somewhat; usually, the excess fear of everything goes away. So basically the country I am in and a number of its neighbors conspire to keep me debilitated and misinformed. Who would tell me the truth? Imprisoning me would be a lot cheaper than all the effort to deceive. This probably means information is enough to escape.<br /><br />Are there drugs legal in other countries? Any good ones legal with a prescription (besides mary)?<br /><br />I rock and daydream for hours on end. What drug causes that? The daydreams can be fun but are more likely depressing.

				Get set up with OneCast (or any pod casting ap) so you can constantly listen to voices that you know are not the people living in your head. That way you can let the outside voices fight the inside voices for you and maybe you can get some much needed sleep.<br /><br />That or meth, I heard from DOD that it helps with mental acuity.&nbsp;

Now the fact that it changes from country to country could mean you have certain allergies which cause ear debris build-up depending on what region you&#039;re in. Tinnitus can be caused by a neurological disorder, but since it varies by region, I&#039;d say you have allergies which are irritated by certain regions.<br /><br />&nbsp;These allergies cause build-up in your ears, similar to how many people get nasal build-up. Cotton tips can work to clean it, if you&#039;re careful, but improper usage can cause impaction, which requires medical mediation. <br /><br />For this reason, I&#039;d recommend using warm water to flush the ears, or using a tool designed to remove the cerumen, I&#039;m most familiar with the Ototek loop. <br /><br />See if that alleviates the symptoms, if not, it could be neurological, but I&#039;m not familiar with the neurological disorder, so that&#039;s where my recommendations stop.
