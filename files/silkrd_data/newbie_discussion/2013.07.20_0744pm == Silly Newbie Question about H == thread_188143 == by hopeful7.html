				I am just curious why some like the black tar and others prefer the lighter colored. Does one serve a better purpose as related to methods of administration. Black tar just looks so gross to me, lol.&nbsp; What is the difference and how is it processed to make it look so different?&nbsp; I am just curious.

				I think black tar is pretty much just for IV while you can snort the lighter powder or melt it down and inject it

I do know no.3 herion is for IV with citric acid heated ect but no.4 is the lighter one (read FrankMathews review thread) and doesn,t need citric ot to be heated but its very strong from what i,ve read, people in there will know more about the blacktar heroin too, pm someone (Darktime?) and ask, take care and +1 for asking&nbsp; ;)

				Black tar heroin, or BTH, is more commonly used for banging (IV) and smoking. #4 heroin, is also used to IV but is commonly snorted. #3 heroin is just to be smoked.<br /><br />To answer your question, the reason some people always get one or the other is mainly due to location and availability. Here in the states, the western half of the US is dominated by BTH, due to the mexican cartels controlling all manufacture and distribution of heroin and almost any other drug found in the western US. They only produce and distribute BTH. In the eastern half of the US #4 heroin reigns dominant.

				Oh, wow, drama in my thread. Certainly didn&#039;t mean for all that to get started.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks to those who took the time to post INFORMATIVE replies and STAYED ON TOPIC to answer my original question. I knew some of the answer, but I wanted to be sure what I was thinking was correct, plus I learned a few new things.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I am an infrequent user, but it does save my life when I need strong pain relief.&nbsp; That is far as I go sharing personal details. I was just seeking information.<br /><br />Ironically enough I live in an area that is said to have some of the strongest and cheapest H there is, and the according to the media it is everywhere.&nbsp; If it is, I can&#039;t find it, but then I am older, so it is more difficult for me to find those connections. Thus, very thankful for Silk Road and &quot;one-stop shopping,&quot;&nbsp; lol!<br /><br />Peace to all!

				there are two types of heroin user. you have heroin addicts and you have junkies. heroin addicts pretty much exclusively use heroin. junkies tend to use any type of drug or alcohol they can get their hands on at any given time. the problem is that ignorance means that the junkies commonly get called and bunched up with the heroin addicts. and then they give us all a bad name.<br /><br />seriously tho, don&#039;t believe everything you hear in the media, its grossly exaggerated for scare mongering purposes. and don&#039;t judge the rest of us from that fucked up tramp you saw lying in a gutter or begging you for change on the street. heroin is a very very safe drug if used properly. less dangerous than pretty much every other drug going.

Gas masks and other lab safety equipment such as gloves and emergency eyewash showers and such are very much worth the money.

				Hey hopeful,<br /><br />Black tar heroin produced in Mexico and is less refined than powdered heroin. BTH is available on the West Coast because the Mexicans control the drug trade to the Western United States. In places like Denver, most of the heroin available is tar, but I have heard there is some powdered heroin #4 available also.<br /><br />The black tar variety is black (or at least quite dark) and less refined because the producers are using a variation of an older process that was developed back in the late 1800&#039;s. I am fairly certain the process that the Mexican cartels are using to acetylate their morphine is a variation on the first process ever discovered to produce heroin. They use acetic acid (basically really concentrated vinegar) rather than acetic anhydride to acetylate morphine.<br /><br />An interesting side effect of the more primitive process used to produce BTH is that it leaves a large amount of monoacetylmorphine derivatives in the end product (6-MAM, 3-MAM) which I have heard causes a more intense &quot;rush&quot; when injected. The 6-MAM in particular is quite potent and very quick to cross the blood-brain barrier.&nbsp; <br /><br />The powdered heroin that is available on the east coast is usually from Columbia or Asia (Southeast Asia or Southwest Asia). From what I have heard and read, the powdered #4 heroin is cleaner than tar, but in terms of potency, tar and powder are fairly close these days.<br /><br />I was always a little confused by the numbering system for heroin, but here is my understanding of it:<br />#1 = Opium (not heroin, so that doesn&#039;t make much sense)<br />#2 = Morphine&nbsp; (again, still not heroin, so I dunno, could be wrong)<br />#3 = Heroin freebase (I hear this is what they get in the UK/Europe. It&#039;s freebase heroin and requires acidification to make it injectable. That&#039;s why ppl in the UK/Europe mix in some citric acid with their heroin before injection. The acid combines with the freebase heroin to make heroin hydrochloride. It&#039;s also supposed to be good for smoking in its freebase form -- just as freebase cocaine (crack) is)<br />#4 = Heroin HCl (heroin hydrochloride, the most refined heroin)<br /><br />Before the Mexicans got as big into the heroin trade and flooded the western US with black tar, virtually all of the heroin in the USA came from the Golden Triangle region of Southeast Asia. The hill tribes there grow poppies and harvest opium that they sell to traders who in turn pass it along to wholesale distributors who operate laboratories to process the crude opium into morphine and then to heroin. I&#039;ve seen reports that state a lot of the SEA heroin gets imported by Asian gangs through Western Canada, but I&#039;m no expert.<br /><br />What I find really interesting is that back from the 1970&#039;s to the mid 1990&#039;s, virtually all of the heroin on the east coast was coming from the Golden Triangle and was controlled by a Burmese warlord named Khun Sa. He was apparently using funds from drug trafficking to finance a guerrilla army fighting for an independent Shan state. I saw a documentary about the guy recently and it was very interesting. For several decades, this guy was called the &quot;Opium King&quot; and was basically behind like 90% of the heroin available on the east coast of the United States and much of the heroin available across the globe.<br /><br />One thing I saw about this guy that really sums up the farce that is the &quot;war on drugs&quot; is how the US and Australian governments handled his offer to cease selling his product on the open market. Here&#039;s a copy/paste from Wikipedia that explains what he offered: <br /><br />&quot;In 1988, Khun Sa was interviewed by Australian journalist Stephen Rice, who had crossed the border from Thailand into Burma illegally. Khun Sa offered to sell his entire heroin crop to the Australian Government for A$ 50m a year for the next eight years, a move that would have virtually stopped the heroin trade into both Australia and the United States overnight. The Australian Government rejected the offer, with Senator Gareth Evans declaring: “The Australian Government is simply not in the business of paying criminals to refrain from criminal activity.”<br /><br />In 1989, Khun Sa was charged by a New York court for trying to import 1,000 tons of heroin. By then he had proposed the USA buy his entire opium production or he would sell it on the international narcotics market.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s right, the governments of the United States and Australia had the opportunity to cut off virtually ALL of the heroin flowing into their respective countries overnight for a small fraction of what they pay fighting their &quot;war on drugs&quot;! Of course they didn&#039;t accept the offer. I suppose it should be left as an exercise for the reader to deduce why they chose not to.<br /><br />One thing I&#039;d like to know is what the prevalence of Afghan heroin in the United States is these days. Near the end of the Taliban&#039;s reign, the production of opium in Afghanistan was at an all-time low. After NATO commenced the &quot;war on terror&quot; in Afghanistan, the production of heroin has increased like 40-50 fold. The most common figure that you hear getting thrown around is that Afghanistan produces 90% of the world&#039;s opium supply. My understanding is that the majority of that ends up in Europe, but I&#039;m sure some of it has to be available in the United States.<br /><br />Anyway, this post has drifted waaaaay off topic, so sorry about that. I was actually just replying to this in order to add on some posts toward my 50 post minimum, lol...<br /><br />With regard to the original question -- if any regular users are reading this and would care to chime in, I am curious as to how the effects of tar compare to the effects of powdered #4. Is there one that is more cost effective for someone with an IV habit? I&#039;ve heard BTH is worse on veins, so is it also cheaper to reflect the fact that is does more harm?<br /><br />-DM<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188143.msg1361224#msg1361224">Quote from: hopeful7 on July 20, 2013, 07:44 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am just curious why some like the black tar and others prefer the lighter colored.

				you know i bought a small £10 bag of heroin one night about 10 years ago now, in london. when i got home and opened it up i found a small piece of moroccan black, about enough for 1 joint. i got straight back on the phone to my man and started having a go and asking wtf he was playing at. he was like calm down, just smoke it, its gear, you&#039;ll see. i&#039;m still thinking wtf when i put the phone down. i looked at it again, it was surely a small piece of moroccan black. i&#039;d sold moroccan black many times before and smoked shit loads of it, so i know exactly what it looks like. anyway i put it on the foil like he said and put a flame to it. i was so surprised when it melted into a nice beetle and i could taste it was smack.<br /><br />so was that black tar heroin i had that night? ..i wondered if it might be opium at the time coz i&#039;d never heard of bth back then. that is the only time i&#039;ve ever seen smack like that, never before and never since.

				yeah i know all that. but was it possible that one time i had black tar heroin? ..i&#039;ve no experience of bth so i don&#039;t really know what it looks like properly. afaik #3 and #4 and morphine do not come as a dark brown shitty lump that closely resembles cannabis resin ever. what i had that night was definitely heroin of some sort tho.<br /><br />btw we do get very good heroin here as well. you do get people who cut the fuck out of it, just like you do anywhere else. once you&#039;ve been on it a while you work out the best places to go. i used to live in west london and found the paki dealers around heathrow airport would usually have some amazingly strong gear. yet you go to the black &#039;yardie&#039; style dealers on the estate and what you get will nearly always be absolute shite.<br /><br />i knew some that would cut the smallest amount of heroin in with a shit load of valium or other downers or sleeping pills. then cut that up with powder foundation make up. they figured the very small amount of gear would sort out the users w/d for a very short time, the downers would make them think it was still pretty good heroin coz they&#039;d be nodding out and shit. but the gear wouldn&#039;t last too long so they would be coming back for even more. i said an addict would know the difference easy but turned out there are a lot of idiot junkies who haven&#039;t got a fucking clue and would buy that shit all day everyday.

Khun Sa offered to sell his entire heroin crop to the Australian Government for A$ 50m a year for the next eight years, a move that would have virtually stopped the heroin trade into both Australia and the United States overnight. The Australian Government rejected the offer, with Senator Gareth Evans declaring: “The Australian Government is simply not in the business of paying criminals to refrain from criminal activity.”<br /><br />In 1989, Khun Sa was charged by a New York court for trying to import 1,000 tons of heroin. By then he had proposed the USA buy his entire opium production or he would sell it on the international narcotics market.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s right, the governments of the United States and Australia had the opportunity to cut off virtually ALL of the heroin flowing into their respective countries overnight for a small fraction of what they pay fighting their &quot;war on drugs&quot;! Of course they didn&#039;t accept the offer. I suppose it should be left as an exercise for the reader to deduce why they chose not to.<br /><br />One thing I&#039;d like to know is what the prevalence of Afghan heroin in the United States is these days. Near the end of the Taliban&#039;s reign, the production of opium in Afghanistan was at an all-time low. After NATO commenced the &quot;war on terror&quot; in Afghanistan, the production of heroin has increased like 40-50 fold. The most common figure that you hear getting thrown around is that Afghanistan produces 90% of the world&#039;s opium supply. My understanding is that the majority of that ends up in Europe, but I&#039;m sure some of it has to be available in the United States.<br /><br />Anyway, this post has drifted waaaaay off topic, so sorry about that. I was actually just replying to this in order to add on some posts toward my 50 post minimum, lol...<br /><br />With regard to the original question -- if any regular users are reading this and would care to chime in, I am curious as to how the effects of tar compare to the effects of powdered #4. Is there one that is more cost effective for someone with an IV habit? I&#039;ve heard BTH is worse on veins, so is it also cheaper to reflect the fact that is does more harm?<br /><br />-DM<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188143.msg1361224#msg1361224">Quote from: hopeful7 on July 20, 2013, 07:44 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I am just curious why some like the black tar and others prefer the lighter colored.

Thanks for explaining that to me, and for the interesting story.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I am not really after the &quot;rush&quot; or even the euphoria, although I enjoy an afternoon or evening of &quot;feeling good&quot; as much as the next person. The greatest benefit for me is the pain relief and being able to function.&nbsp; I take such tiny amounts it is laughable, yet enough, because I do have a tolerance from pills.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I never expected so many replies to this post, lol!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Have a wonderful day, everyone!

				That squidgy black heroin you talk of was in my area about 10 years ago,maybe 15 but it wasnt bth.bth is hard and has to be shaved with a blade to get it into powder.I really haven&#039;t a clue what is was but I was dubious at first too.It was hard to break down too.<br /><br />Also d0peymeans number rating is spot on.<br /><br />#4 is the best but its bloody expensive.also,if you can run it on foil,it isnt a true #4

				Personally, I like black tar heroin better than #4.&nbsp; Someone earlier said bth is not heroin but morphine.&nbsp; This is incorrect.&nbsp; Also the average purity of bth is also 30%.&nbsp; There are also more opioids in bth than just diamorphine and I think it makes for a more dynamic high.&nbsp;
