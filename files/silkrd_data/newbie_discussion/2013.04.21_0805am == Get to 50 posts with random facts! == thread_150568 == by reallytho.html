				n 1989, the forward cargo door of a 747 failed and opened up. The plane was carrying 3 crew members, 15 flight attendants, and 337 passengers. The incident caused 11 seats to be ejected and nine people died.<br /><br />A flight attendant in the Business Class cabin was almost pulled out of the airplane, and was seen by passengers and fellow crew members clinging to a seat leg; they were able to pull her to safety inside the cabin, although she was severely injured. Another flight attendant in the Business Class Cabin hung on to the steps leading to the upper deck, and was dangling from them when the decompression occurred.<br /><br />The pilots began an emergency descent to get the aircraft down into breathable air rapidly, while performing a 180-degree left turn to fly back to Honolulu. The decompression damaged components of the on-board emergency oxygen supply system, which was primarily located in the forward cargo sidewall area, just aft of the cargo door.<br /><br />

				The purple dye, and the cloth made from it, was so famous that the Greeks called the land of Tyre and Sidon (equivalent to modern Lebanon) Phoinike, &quot;the land of the purple&quot;. It required 250,000 shellfish to produce one ounce of Tyrian purple dye, making it very slow and costly to produce. The preferred method was to collect vast piles of shellfish and to allow them to decompose in the sun (classical authors attest to the stench). Production and export of the dye began around 1,200BC and fuelled the Phoenician expansion across the Mediterranean. By the third century BC, Tyrian purple was worth more than gold: a pound of it cost three times the yearly wage of a Roman baker.

				<br />Purple royal<br /><br />Although the Greeks were the original customers, it was the Romans who became purple fanatics. They liked a dark shade, achieved by using dyes from two species of murex, one a dark indigo. Pliny the Elder described it as the &quot;colour of clotted blood&quot; and wrote that &quot;it brightens every garment, and shares with gold the glory of the triumph&quot;. Triumphant generals wore robes of purple and gold while senators and consuls wore bands of purple at the edges of their togas. In imperial Rome, the use of purple was even more highly regulated: by the fourth century AD, only the emperor was allowed to wear the best purple. The colour&#039;s exclusivity and connection with power is why royal robes and the vestments of bishops have traditionally been purple.

				The word “trivia” comes from the latin tri-vium, mean­ing the inter­sec­tion of three roads. In the Mid­dle Ages, local towns would post their news on bill­boards nearby that were at the inter­sec­tion of three or more roads, so as to max­i­mize the num­ber of trav­el­ers who would see it. Ran­dom, obscure facts that were picked up while trav­el­ing then became known as “trivia.”

				Fulgurite is the name for fossilized lightning. They are natural hollow glass tubes formed in quartzose sand, or silica, or soil by lightning strikes and are formed when lightning with a temperature of at least 1,800 degrees Celsius instantaneously melts silica on a conductive surface and fuses grains together

				In Ancient China, the plant, known as Ma, was used for food, fuel, clothing, and medicine going back to 6,000 B.C. But the oldest existing reference to medical marijuana dates to 2737 B.C. when the Red Emperor Shen Nung is credited with writing The Herbal, a listing of medicinal properties of various herbs, including Ma, to alleviate rheumatism and gout pain. In 2 A.D. Hua T&#039;o is recorded as having used Ma-yo (the female plant) and red wine as an anesthesia while he performed painful surgeries including organ grafts and loin incisions.

				That&#039;s right, a recent study of 5,000 pot smokers by UCSF and University of Alabama showed that those who only smoke a few joints a week actually had stronger lung capacity and external blowing force than non-users. A 2005 UCLA paper also shows that marijuana smoke might actually help to PREVENT lung cancer. Unlike tobacco, which contains nicotine and is a known carcinigen, marijuana contains cannibinoids and THC, which seem to discourage cancer. It is also impossible to die of an overdose. Put that in your pipe and smoke it<br /><br />

				While use of cannabis was primarily medicinal in Ancient China, over in India they liked to party with it. It was a common substance, used in religious ceremonies and to help people chill out. It was often ingested as a drink, boiled with nuts and milk called Bhang. It made people happy, so much so that the British Colonial Government was concerned it might be driving the population insane. They commissioned a study and issued a report entitled The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report of 1894. It not only concluded that mainstream usage was harmless, but also that a ban on it might actually prove more detrimental.<br /><br />

				A 2007 Government report estimated that 14.4 million Americans smoked pot during a one month testing period. One study in 2006 suggested that marijuana is the largest cash crop in the US at $35.8 Billion, but that number has recently been disputed, with a contrasting report putting it as low as $2.1 Billion. (Either way, it&#039;s still a large, essentially unknowable number.) The largest producer of marijuana in the world is Mexico, followed by Paraguay. But who are the biggest users of the drug? The Good ol&#039; USA. According to a study in Time, 42% of Americans have tried it. Even President Obama has smoked it.<br /><br />

				Uses of the hemp plant fiber itself are numerous. It can be made into rope, paper, clothing, canvas, eaten as a food, and its seeds can be used for fuel. It&#039;s also good for the planet. A study by McGill University in Canada estimated that 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 million acres of industrial hemp would take care of all of our oil needs. In addition, unlike tobacco, which destroys the soil after every crop, planting cannabis actually improves it. It is legal in Uruguay, Peru, India, and even in Iran for it to be grown for food/fuel. Legalization of both hemp and marijuana would produce thousands of jobs, take care of world hunger, cut back on greenhouse gases, and help people cope with the pain of AIDs, glaucoma, and cancer. It turns out that getting “high” from it is just an added bonus<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve always wanted to take a trip to SA and take ayahusca (bad at spelling) with a shaman. They say smoking DMT drops you in the 5th dimension, the spirit dimension. Apparently SA shaman believe there are 12 total dimensions and they take you up past 5 and back again over a few days. Takes a toll on the body/cleans the soul.

				I wish I could afford to go to SA. But as a nice starting point to that realm I think DMT was a wise choice. I Tried DMT first to make sure I like the trip before getting stuck in it for several hours, but now that I have tried this I would not hesitate to try ayahuasca, changa, meo-5 or any other DMT derivative.

				The idea of friendship has become so fucked up this day in age. There are individuals that use people... Always with their hand out asking for something... They never offer anything, when asked they bulk, but they never cease to have their hand out and fully expect you to indulge them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve met a few people that consider this type of individual their BEST friend... I would like to tell those people that you are fooling yourself and need to crawl past the bullshit. <br /><br />A friend is the person that is completely honest with you about all things. Who doesn&#039;t want or expect something from you and who will be there for all the good and all the bad... And when the bad as you flat on your ass not knowing what you&#039;re going to do with yourself, your life, a true friend will be sitting next to you... ready and willing to do what they can to help you pick yourself back up. <br /><br />More people in the world need to see past the bullshit... Need to realize what a true friend is so we quit feeding the bottom feeders. My opinion, bottom feeders deserve all the negative shit they bring on themselves.

				The japanese language is written in three distinct systems of writing. Katakana, which is used for all foreign words, and also like we use bold or italics text, and Hiragana and Kanji, which are used together for native words. Interestingly, Kanji are used as a &quot;core&quot;, which boats the base meaning, while Hiragana modify nuance, so you have kanji that means &quot;run&quot;, and then some hiragana on the end, which change the meaning to &quot;is running&quot;, &quot;did run&quot;, &quot;must run&quot; et al.

				It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence, several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity. This is what it thought, as it fell &quot;Ahhh! Woooh! What&#039;s happening? Who am I? Why am I here? What&#039;s my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? Okay okay, calm down calm down get a grip now. Ooh, this is an interesting sensation. What is it? Its a sort of tingling in my... well I suppose I better start finding names for things. Lets call it a... tail! Yeah! Tail! And hey, what&#039;s this roaring sound, whooshing past what I&#039;m suddenly gonna call my head? Wind! Is that a good name? It&#039;ll do. Yeah, this is really exciting. I&#039;m dizzy with anticipation! Or is it the wind? There&#039;s an awful lot of that now isn&#039;t it? And what&#039;s this thing coming toward me very fast? So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like &#039;Ow&#039;, &#039;Ownge&#039;, &#039;Round&#039;, &#039;Ground&#039;! That&#039;s it! Ground! Ha! I wonder if it&#039;ll be friends with me? Hello, Ground!&quot;

				I&#039;ll just call it a true story, then it will be an fun fact<br /><br />Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn&#039;t seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, &quot;My friend is dead! What can I do?&quot;. The operator says &quot;Calm down. I can help. First, let&#039;s make sure he&#039;s dead.&quot; There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says &quot;OK, now what?&quot;

				In 1986 Judge Young released his decision on the laws, science, and use surrounding MDMA, declaring that MDMA was safe when used under medical supervision, did not have a high potential for addiction, and had legitimate medical use. As such, Judge Young said, it was not legal to place MDMA higher than Schedule 3. This much less restrictive category would have allowed doctors to continue to use MDMA, but would have still made sale without a prescription illegal.

				After several years of motions, hearings, and angry debate, the doctors and scientists appeared to have achieved victory: On January 27 1988, the courts agreed with Justice Young&#039;s original opinion and ordered the Drug Enforcement Agency to reassess its Scheduling decision. In the meanwhile, MDMA is removed from Schedule 1, becoming briefly legal once again.

				The DEA, complying with the court order, &#039;re-evaluated&#039; their decision. And decided that they had been right all along, and the doctors, scientists, and courts were the ones that were wrong about the science and the law. They permanently declared MDMA Schedule 1, taking effect on March 23, 1988.

				In 1991 Alexander Shulgin&#039;s legendary book, &quot;PIHKAL&quot; is published, and the world discovers what &#039;Sasha&#039; has been up to in the past few decades. Book has a massive drug section describing the structures, dosages, effects, and synthesis of nearly 180 psychoactive drugs, most of which Shulgin had invented; many of which were new to science.<br /><br />Within the book were also glowing descriptions of the effects of MDMA:<br />&nbsp;&quot;I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great, or believed this to be possible. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvelous feeling of solid inner strength continued through the rest of the day, and evening, and into the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the experience...&quot;<br />

				In 2001 alarmed by skyrocketing use of MDMA and their own clear inability to stop it, the US government increases penalties, making the distribution of MDMA ten times more severely punished, dose for dose, than heroin. In spite of being opposed by prominent scientists and even the former head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse as irrational and a diversion of resources from the control of truly dangerous drugs, the measure passes easily.

				5-HTP is the chemical your brain turns into serotonin. Since MDMA use depletes serotonin levels, 5-HTP is a quite useful tool for recovering after use. Taking a little 5-HTP can prevent the more notorious possible aftereffects of MDMA use, such as depression and anxiety for a day or two (which is partly due to low serotonin levels.)

				Some people have been to the point of selling their souls on eBay to pay the bills. The following stories are a few desperate attempts to sell their soul for some quick cash.<br /><br />Sorry! You Can’t Sell Souls on eBay<br /><br />One man attempted to sell his soul on eBay for $5,000 USD. The item title read: “my soul – One HUMAN SOUL – REAL!!” and the condition was stated in “Like new condition.” The item description read: “One human soul, male, 24 years old in this life cycle. Clean and free of liens and satanic rutuals Very playful soul, curious yet wise…Still early enough to make it your own! This soul only has a few years on it, practically brand new.”<br />&nbsp;<br />He reportedly only received one offer of $666 from a Canadian man, well below the $5,000.00 asking price.<br /><br /><br />

				Syd Barrett, the original frontman and primary composer for Pink Floyd helped start the underground LSD movement in London. I&#039;m fascinated with it, kind of like the Velvet Underground of the UK. <br /><br />Most people drop L and listen to dark side, or animals, or the wall. I&#039;m sorry you all, you are missing out, none of those members combined did as much LSD as Syd. <br /><br />LISTEN TO PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN. You will be mind blown.

				In rough terms, in any sort of &quot;theory&quot;, there will always be at least one thing that you cannot prove to be true OR false.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a mathematician, you probably know what I&#039;m referring to and can be much more precise as to the exact formulation of said phrase.
