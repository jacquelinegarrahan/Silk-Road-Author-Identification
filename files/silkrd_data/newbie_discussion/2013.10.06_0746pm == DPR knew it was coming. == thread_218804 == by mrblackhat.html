				Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go.&nbsp; Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well.&nbsp; They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay #1, we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty.<br /><br />There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well.&nbsp; Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming.&nbsp; What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life.&nbsp; I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another.&nbsp; <br /><br />*******************************I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause.&nbsp; I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter.*************************************&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t read it yet, please do.&nbsp; Here is the link:<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter<br /><br />The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart.&nbsp; I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.<br /><br />Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don&#039;t have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain.&nbsp; And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.&nbsp; Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms :)<br /><br />Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.

				Lol, I think DPRs attitude will change when he&#039;s getting pounded by a seven foot black guy calling him&nbsp; shirley at Riker&#039;s Island. Have you taken a look at DPR? He&#039;s basically a teenage trust fund kid. Oh yeah, he&#039;ll really stand up for his beliefs when it comes to a life sentence. Yeah right, he was just a charlatan trying to make an extra buck. Nothing believed to be legitimate needs to be legitimized.&nbsp; He has about as much resolution as a cockroach.
