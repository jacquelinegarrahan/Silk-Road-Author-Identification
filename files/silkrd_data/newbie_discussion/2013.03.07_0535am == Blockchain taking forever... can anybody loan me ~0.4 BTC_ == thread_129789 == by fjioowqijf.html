				Sup all.&nbsp; Hate to be this guy, but I really want to log off and go to sleep but want to get this order in.&nbsp; Trying to get some DMT from rogerpete, I&#039;m about $15.53 short (~0.3-0.4 BTC).&nbsp; Sent it to my SR account almost 2 hours ago and it&#039;s still sitting in blockchain as unconfirmed.&nbsp; Ugh.<br /><br />BTW, any insight as to why the hell it&#039;s taking so long would be appreciated.<br /><br />Peace

Whenever it hits your address, your account will show as credited if the transaction has been confirmed. I&#039;ve never seen my own credited before 3 transactions and never took longer than 8 (other than when I got caught in the deposit bug a couple weeks ago). Then that deposit is marked to tumble and will be withdrawn at some point, but your account is credited immediately. So no I don&#039;t think BTC activity affects it and yes if you&#039;re at 3 confirmations I would think they would arrive in the next few blocks... hopefully there still aren&#039;t deposit issues...<br /><br />Again though all of that is just speculation based off only my own experiences.
