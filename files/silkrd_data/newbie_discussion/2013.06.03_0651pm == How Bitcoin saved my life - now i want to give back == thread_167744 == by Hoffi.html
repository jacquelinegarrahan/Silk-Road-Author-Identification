				Hello, my name is Herbert Hoffmann, I&#039;m 42 years old and live in germany. 2 years ago i got depressed and thought of killing myself. I was self-employed in the financial sector for years and made very decent money by writing my own scripts for speculating. 2 years ago i lost nearly everything in my divorce. My children stopped contacting me and i lost my house and my cars. For a while i worked at grocery stores because i had no money left for speculating. I wasted almost all my free time on the internet and found bitcoin quite a while ago.<br />I invested about 200€, followed the market all day and started writing scripts again. Last month i was able to buy a house in the USA in the middle of nowhere ;) I can go fishing there and have enough money to live the rest of my days there, just relaxing in the nature. My plane is going friday.<br /><br />There won&#039;t be any internet, and i&#039;m not interested in it. I still have 2500btc laying around which i don&#039;t need anymore and can&#039;t liquidate till friday anyway.<br />So i wrote my last script: Every bitcoin that you send till thursday evening to the following adress will come back doubled thursday night: 1NcJwpT4cyNsJWWeXHkWLZzRQ43zCXtVYt<br /><br />If more than 2500btc get send, everything over 2500 will just be returned. If less than 2500btc get send, please tell me where you wish me to donate the rest to.<br />I won&#039;t be online till Thursday and can&#039;t reply to this thread, moving to the USA takes a lot of preparation.<br /><br />Thanks to all of you who helped making Bitcoin popular. You saved my life and have my eternal gratitude!<br />(You can see my topic promoted on bitcointalk.org so as reddit.com:-)<br /><br />Best regards, Herbert
