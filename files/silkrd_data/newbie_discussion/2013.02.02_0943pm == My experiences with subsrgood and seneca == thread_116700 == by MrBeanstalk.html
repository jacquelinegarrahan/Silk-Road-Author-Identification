				I&#039;ve been buying on SR and browsing the forums for about a month or so, but only started posting yesterday. I wanted to post this in seneca&#039;s vendor review thread, but every time I go there, I don&#039;t see a reply icon, or the quick reply field, so I decided to just post in here, since i know I can post shit in the Newbie discussion forum.<br /><br />First off, Seneca:<br /><br />I was in a bit of a crisis the other day. I was almost completely out of my monthly supply of suboxone, which I get from a dr, and I needed to get enough to last until I go back to the dr. I messaged numerous suboxone vendors, and the first one to reply that day was seneca. Seneca told me that he could sell me the number of subs that I needed, and get them in the mail that same day, sent express (something he normally doesn&#039;t offer). But instead of doing the normal order, I was supposed to just do a BTC transfer him. I was a little hesitant, but I did it anyway. A little time passed, and then seneca messaged me back and told me thath they were on the way, and delivery was guaranteed for the next day, but I didn&#039;t get a DCN. I placed my order at around 3:00 PM Eastern. I have never made a purchase using this method. Normally I place my order, and I never FE. So that whole night I was nervous. I had a million thoughts racing through my head. &quot;What if he is just bullshitting me and didn&#039;t get them in the mail today?&quot;, &quot;What if he just fucked me out of my money?&quot;, &quot;I probably should not have done that BTC transfer.&quot;, &quot;I should have ordered them from someone I have already used.&quot; But, to my relief, I woke up the next morning around 9:30, and within 90 minutes I heard someone opening my buildings mailbox. (My apartment is right next to the mailbox, so I can hear when the mail comes.) I go out and open my mailbox, and there it is. A blue and white express envelope. I opened it up and there they were. Just what I had ordered. IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS!! Sorry to ramble on and on about this, but I really wanted to get all the details in. Seneca is a trustworthy dude, and he did right by me. I didn&#039;t place an official order, and he had my money right from the start, but he followed through on what he said he would do, and got my medicine to me in less than 24 hours, and he always answered any PM that I sent. Now THAT is damn good service.<br /><br />Now, for subsrgood:<br /><br />I have placed two orders with subsrgood. The first, I ordered 2 subutex pills, priority shipping. I received my order within 72 hours, and he communicated with me all the way. Only one slight issue, the pills were kind of crushed, but I could still tell that they were real and the right quantity. I told him about it, and he assured me that it won&#039;t happen again, and he would make it up to me on my next order. The next order I placed was yesterday afternoon. He did a custom order for me, 8 adderalls and 3 subutex pills. The adderalls were for my wife, and she wanted them by Saturday. So on this order I went with express shipping. I placed the order at 4:00 PM Eastern, and at 10:00 AM this morning they were here. THEY ARRIVED IN 18 HOURS!!! All the pills were there, and all were intact. And he gave me a good price, too. Great communication, great packaging, great products. Subsrgood is truly one of the best vendors I have dealt with on SR so far.<br /><br />I have also had good dealings with jamesbrown, supremesmoke, purest, and nod, and all 4 have top notch heroin. Supremesmoke has the best china white I have ever done, .5 g lasted me 5 days, and I have one HELL of a tolerance. Nod has the best BTH I have ever done in my life. But the other vendors have good product as well, and all have great customer service. And from what I understand, subsrgood has some pretty damn good #4 H as well, but I haven&#039;t tried it. I&#039;m trying to stay off the white horse for a while. Thanks for letting me ramble on, I hope this review can help some of you guys out there.<br /><br />
