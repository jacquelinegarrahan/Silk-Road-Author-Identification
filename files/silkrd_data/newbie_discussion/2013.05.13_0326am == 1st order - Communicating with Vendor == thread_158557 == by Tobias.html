				I found a vendor I want to buy from. His info says 1st time buyers should send him a message first and also to encrypt everything. Please can anyone answer a few questions?<br /><br />If I use SR&#039;s messaging system, how do I give him my PGP key? Should I post it in the start of the message, so he can use it to decrypt the message below?<br /><br />There is a thread to post PGP keys in the security section of the forum, but I can&#039;t imagine the vendor is gonna scoll through all the posts looking for my PGP key, so what is the point of that thread.<br /><br />Also, are all messages automatically encrypted by SR, the same way that they say your name and address in the shopping cart is encrypted.<br /><br />Really grateful if someone can explain to me how it&#039;s usually done - Thanks

				When sending a vendor an encrypted message, make sure you use their public key to encrypt it.&nbsp; Then when writing them an encrypted message just put your public key at the end of the message.&nbsp; They only need your public key to respond with an encrypted message.

				Thanks, for some reason, I thought he needed my public key to read my encrypted message. Maybe I should run through the tutorial again to get it straight in my head. So, I encrypt the message using his key and he doesn&#039;t need my key to decipher it, only to encrypt a message to send back to me. OK, got it

Ideally you would get their GPG keys from a trusted keyserver instead of Silk Road, but nobody here seems to be that paranoid.

				(also, no, messages are not automatically encrypted by SR ... you need to manually encrypt your messages.&nbsp; this way, everyone is 100% in control of their own PGP key, their own decrypting, and their own encrypting ... which is safer, as far as i understand it.)

				Thanks guys, All very helpful. Just one more thing: The buyers guide says that the name and address I put in the shopping cart IS encrypted. Is this automatically done by SR? and should I encrypt the name and address manually myself before I put it in the shopping cart?

				I would like to add that I don&#039;t trust getting someone&#039;s public key from a site other than SR or the SR forums.&nbsp; I&#039;m very careful to watch what links I click on, no matter who it is from or where I find it.&nbsp; If there is a link to a forum thread I&#039;m actually paranoid/careful enough to copy the first half from my browser (such as the forum hostname), then the second half from their link so I know that the information is being sent to the real SR server.<br /><br />On the note of keys, I want to reiterate the function of private and public keys as it may help you to remember laid out differently.<br /><br />There are public and private keys.<br /><br />Private Key&#039;s let you decrypt anything encrypted with the corresponding public key.<br /><br />Anyone can send you an encrypted message that you can read as long as they use your public key.<br /><br />***Never send anyone your private key.***<br /><br />Public keys are what you need to encrypt messages with in order for the other party to be able to read your message with their private key.<br /><br />Sorry if this info was a bit redundant, it took me a bit of time to get the hang of it myself and I wanted to ensure that others understand the process as well.<br />****<br />As I am typing this I saw your new message about encrypting the name and address:<br />You should always use your own encryption there as well.&nbsp; In fact that is the most important part about learning how to encrypt.

				Current Buyer&#039;s Guide says this:<br /><br />&quot;Shopping cart <br /><br />............Once your cart is ready, you must enter the address you would like your items sent to. This is the one point in the process where some kind of personal information is revealed. We take this very seriously and have taken every precaution to protect it.<br /><br />Receiving address<br /><br />From the moment you submit your order, to the moment it is displayed to your vendor, the information is fully encrypted and totally unreadable. Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is irretrievable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key so that even we at Silk Road would be unable to view it, even if we wanted to. &quot;<br /><br />So, it doesn&#039;t initially say you have to encrypt it, but that it is encrypted when you send it. Then it says that you can encrypt manually to be extra cautious. I would be pissed if I sent unencrypted after reading this to find it hadn&#039;t been encrypted, so I&#039;m gonna encrypt it myself.<br /><br />Thank you

				Yep, Thanks Scout. I am clear on this now. I think it&#039;s a good idea to get someone to make that section in the Buyer&#039;s guide clearer. I&#039;m sure I am not the only one who read that and thought SR encrypted the shipping details for you.<br /><br />Thank you

If your entire message is encrypted this can&#039;t happen, they can&#039;t see that you&#039;re even sending your public key!<br /><br />Secondly if your public key isn&#039;t encrypted then you&#039;re leaking information. You&#039;re saying &quot;this is the first time that we&#039;ve spoken securely&quot; to anyone who is snooping on the message, which may or may not be useful information to them. Maybe this rules something else out or gives them some info that they can use to trick you in future. <br /><br />As a matter of good security practice you should leak as little information as possible, partly to fuck with anyone who may be snooping but mostly for your own peace of mind and more importantly, smugness.
