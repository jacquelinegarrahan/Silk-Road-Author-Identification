				You still have the same number of bitcoins.&nbsp; If you hold onto them they will be worth more in the future.&nbsp; If I sold mine right now I would have lost several thousand dollars so don&#039;t feel bad.&nbsp; Keep that chin up!

				I used silkroad a fair amount during 2011.&nbsp; After my last transaction,&nbsp; I had about 11 BTC left.&nbsp; Keep in mind they were worth $4-5 at the time.&nbsp; Due to some real life circumstances I had to leave Silk Road and give up drugs for a bit.&nbsp; Last week I read that BTC was over 200$/coin and couldn&#039;t believe my eyes.&nbsp; I immediately rushed back here and bought a load of goods with the coins that had sat on my account the past year and a half.&nbsp; I still am in a position in which I can not use drugs for 4 more months,&nbsp; but once I am able to again I will have enough to last me a year.&nbsp; Crazy to think that what was worth 50-60$ to me 18 months ago was worth over $2,000 a week ago.

				If you lost a lot, just let it climb back again again. You&#039;ve only really lost once the market stabilizes and the fluctuations end, but who knows when or if that will happen.

				I have been hanging around and studying the silk road and bitcoins for about 3 months.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the exact time, but they were under $30 when I first started.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say my slowness to jump in had something to do with their rise in value.&nbsp; It seemed like I was getting played.&nbsp; They only went up after i started loooking.<br /><br />The first time I learned about Bitcoins was also the same time I learned about Silk Road so, I am in this for the drugs.&nbsp; Bitcoins are a great idea, but until EVERYBODY knows about them (and has a good lesson in DEMAND markets aka interest bubbles)&nbsp; there will be people who say &quot;Oh an easy way to make money? I&#039;ll buy some.&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;Oh, you can buy drugs with them? I&#039;ll buy some.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s NOT easy, but since there&#039;s a pot of gold (or pot) at the end of the rainbow, don&#039;t underestimate the power of greed or need. <br /><br />I hope this recent dive taught people that markets are volatile and bubbles happen and didn&#039;t teach people that bitcoins are a bad idea.&nbsp; I have confidence in the currency, but these interest bubbles will probably continue to happen as new circles of people are exposed to the idea.

				I was lucky. I could see the price going up, and up and up, and got concerned about a crash. Once the price got to $100USD per BTC, I started getting rid of any coin i had, by continually buying and selling. At the end, I did lose a far bit, but i made just as much, or more whilst the prices were going up. In fact i have continued to do business through the crash and did not cancel/delay any orders. It&#039;s a shame that some of my suppliers stopped selling, or insisted on FE (which i refused to do).<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya

				I lost about ¬£300 with the crash. My SR stats say I&#039;ve spent ¬£600 in six months since joining so I had a plan and that was to buy roughly ¬£600 worth of coins (ie. six months worth supply) and try living off the interest.<br /><br />It was amazing for a while watching the value of my account continuously soar. I was constantly texting my gf every couple of hours saying &quot;I&#039;ve just made ¬£50&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ve just made ¬£80.&quot; My investment was making me more money online than I was getting paid for going to work! Then it went bust. <br /><br />I won&#039;t be ordering anything for a couple of weeks so I&#039;m hoping in the meantime it might go back up a bit more. I realise its not going to reach the same dizzy heights as last time quite yet but if it gets anywhere near ¬£90 a coin by that time then I will more or less have broken even since I still hold a couple of coins bought at ¬£20-30.

				luckily i had a random 600 to throw in when it was around $30 a bc, so I ended up getting essintially a free laptop that woulda cost me like 900 and some other small things. then when goddam bubble popped I had made my order for a lb of some good green from bayareabudz(great vendor btw) when it was at like $187 and he didnt process till it was all the way down to 100 and had at least 5 other people getting at least hp&#039;s so big thumbs up for bayareabudz for takin a loss for his customers. I will def be buying from him again, but in relation to this discussion I have not lost but only have gained from SR and the bitcoin market so far in my time here. My latest loss was in a robbery while on vacation =( while very shitty, I had to come to realization that there are people who cheat and steal to achieve anything in life, and even if you have but 1 honest dollar to your name, there will be 5 con&#039;s trying to pull it from you most anywhere you go... lol hidden security cameras + better locking mechanism for windows + nothing worth alot in home when gone = problem solved and never to happen again
