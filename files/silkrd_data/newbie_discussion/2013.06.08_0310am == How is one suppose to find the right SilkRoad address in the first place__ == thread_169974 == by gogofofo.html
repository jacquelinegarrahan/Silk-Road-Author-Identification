				After reading about how phishers will post fake Silk Road addressing on wikipedia and the hidden wiki, which is how i found the address to the silk road, now i&#039;m wondering how a newbie was suppose to figure out the address in the first place. Certainly not a simple google or duckduckgo search. In fact, now that i think about, there&#039;s no reason for me to be certain that silkroadvb5piz3r.onion is the legit address, that even this forum is legit, or that the silk road wiki link i&#039;ve been reading that specifies silkroadvb5piz3r.onion as the correct address is legit as well, since my start in all this has been through the hidden wiki link, and even that site might now be the real one. Anyone care to clarify?

				This is a good question, as I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s where I first discovered the URL as well.

				The short answer? <br /><br />You&#039;re not!<br /><br />That&#039;s right. We don&#039;t want anyone to know the address, or even to know of the existence of such a hypothetical place. <br /><br />I mean we wouldn&#039;t if there was one. <br /><br />I mean what&#039;s the Silk Road? <br /><br />Catching my drift!<br /><br />(shh! Don&#039;t tell anybody! It&#039;s a secret!)

				You would determine it the same way that you should evaluate any information that you find online.&nbsp; If you google &#039;Silk Road drugs&#039;, you get the correct address in the first two search returns.&nbsp; After you&#039;ve seen the same address in a few different places, like when searching ofr other information, you know that it&#039;s probably correct.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a probability game than an exact science.<br /><br />Phishing works by having you input your credentials (login/password) and then, instead of taking you to the real site, just steals your credentials.&nbsp; So when a site allows you to register, you know that it&#039;s not a phishing site. So if you get to the SR page, or the forums page, and can&#039;t register, but can login, you might want to investigate further.&nbsp; But a newbie needs to register.&nbsp; If you went to the phishing site, you wouldn&#039;t be able to register because new users aren&#039;t useful to phishers.*<br /><br />*There are other ways that you could be scammed by a fake site that let you register and then make deposits, but it would require a much more substantial effort be to spoof an entire site replica.&nbsp; Phishers just spoof the login page.

				Every Scam site that I&#039;ve come accross has always wanted my PIN on the login screen.&nbsp; If you are asked for your pin then do not log in! The correct site url is Silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&nbsp; Memorize the fuck outta that dude!
