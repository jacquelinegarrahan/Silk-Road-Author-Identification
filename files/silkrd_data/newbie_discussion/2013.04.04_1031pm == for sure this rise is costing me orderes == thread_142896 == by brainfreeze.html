				Since BTC has stupidly high my orders have falling, this must be because of the rise in btc. People who have to buy BTC now i dont think have the money and sellers of btc are asking for huge sums.

				Don&#039;t prices automatically adjust on this site based on the BTC value? <br /><br />So the product will cost the same and it wont cost the user any more in real money t buy your product. Maybe your service has gone down the shitter? :)

				Are your prices pegged to a $ amount, if so this shouldn&#039;t effect your orders.&nbsp; Perhaps check the market out to see if your still price competitive.

				I can see that this could be true. If what you are selling costs less than the current value of one bitcoin, buyers may be hesitant to buy that bitcoin if they think they&#039;re not going to use the whole thing. Meaning that they would have &#039;leftover&#039; money just hanging out as a partial btc that they don&#039;t plan to use. I think that might be a more realistic possibility.

You don&#039;t have to buy BTC in whole amounts. <br /><br />And yes, unless you yourself have raised your prices, the increase shouldn&#039;t really affect you. If anything you should have more business, since buyers have been seeing their balances increase and therefore have more spending power.

				I have gained ~$400 on my btc between buying and making a purchase, but I suggest if you planned on gettin drugs at any point, you get them, never know if it will crash and leave you completely empty handed.

				yes my prices haven&#039;t gone up as btc has gone up what im asking in btc has gone down. But what im saying is im sure the rise in BTC is putting people off buying them, as most people buy from non official places they are whacking more on top, look at ebay and people are paying £120-£150 a bitcoin then that puts the cost of the drugs they are buying sky high&nbsp;
