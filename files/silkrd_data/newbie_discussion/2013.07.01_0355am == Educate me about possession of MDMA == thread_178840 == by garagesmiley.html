				I am contemplating my first SR order.&nbsp; It will be ecstasy, one or two tabs to get started.&nbsp; I have done my due diligence and research.&nbsp; My PGP is dialed in and my account is stocked with bitcoins that I believe are untraceable.<br />What I am curious about is what if everything goes bad and I get busted.&nbsp; I have no prior arrests or any record at all.&nbsp; What kind of penalties am I looking at for that kind of volume?&nbsp; I will say that I&#039;m in Colorado.&nbsp; Is there a certain volume of X where the penalties increase?<br />Thanks for any input.

				In many states MDMA is one of the hardest prosecuted drugs possible, it nearly always carries mandatory minimum sentences for any amount and usually is prosecuted harder than meth or cocaine. even in personal usage amounts.

				&quot;Possession of Ecstasy, in Colorado, is a felony. Even if you possess as little as one pill of Ecstasy, it is still a felony. It is also a felony to sell or give away Ecstasy, or to possess the substance with the intent to distribute it. An adult felony criminal conviction for Possession of Ecstasy, in Colorado, carries with it a possible sentence of incarceration in prison for up to 12 years. If you possess Ecstasy with the intent to sell or distribute the drug, you can face up to 16 years in prison. In cases where there are exceptional circumstances, a court could sentence you to 32 years in prison. Fines for possessing Ecstasy for your use or for possessing Ecstasy with the intent to sell or distribute Ecstasy to others can range from $3,000.00 to $750,000.00. As a juvenile (under the age of eighteen) Possession, Possession with Intent to Distribute Ecstasy or Sale or Distribution of Ecstasy can adjudicate you with a felony, and lead to your incarceration in a juvenile detention facility for up to 2 years. A juvenile felony adjudication carries many bad consequences besides a possible prison sentence, and may even hamper your ability to go to college, or get certain jobs. &quot;<br /><br />~Sourced: http://www.denverda.org/ CLEARNET WARNING OBVIOUSLY<br /><br />Seems like a drug I would keep a cyanide capsule next to incase I got caught in my infinite paranoia.

				if you have no prior convictions on your record then I would assume that the judge would take it easy on you (minimal sentance) hopefully a slap on the hand and some bullshit community service or something.
