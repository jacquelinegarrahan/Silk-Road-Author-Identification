				If I understand correctly you placed order an around 4 days ago and soon cancel will become an option?<br /><br />Well a few things can be happening, <br /><br />1. your vendors didn&#039;t get your order in time before the weekend and will be shipping out this week as soon as they ship them most vendors will then mark in transit.&nbsp; <br />2. your vendors only ship on specific days, maybe only once a week, did you read their profile, normally if they do they will say it.<br />3. your vendor is inundated with orders just backed up so messages orders they are all delayed<br />4. anything else I didn&#039;t mention, something could be wrong sure..these guys are human and stuff does happen<br /><br />I dunno what your looking for but yeah if communication isn&#039;t great and shipping is slow and there are other vendors that sell the same thing also with decent rating, go for the others but just remember you&#039;ve already sent your address...<br /><br />O and the vendors can already see that your new, once you place an order they can see your stats, says it somewhere in the wiki

They have 4 days in which to ship the order before you have the option to cancel. If your order has been sitting for a few days then it is unlikely that they have chosen not to do business with you; if that were the case they simply would have cancelled it.<br /><br />You have messaged them stating that you&#039;re interested in buying etc., so you&#039;ve done pretty much everything you can at this point.<br /><br />Best of luck with the orders, let us know how they go! :)<br /><br />Libertas<br /><br />EDIT: Excellent post from DoctorFate, as well. +1

				You fine, just take your time, message with orders, once you&#039;ve spent a few coin, you look good. Gentle people buyers always welcome!

				One of my orders went into in-transit.&nbsp; It was from a vendor highly spoken of in the forum and their vendor comments.&nbsp; I suppose I&#039;m already on my way to being accepted.&nbsp; If anything the orders that have waited 5+ days I can cancel and reorder with the vendor that trusted me until my stats look better.<br /><br />Thanks.
