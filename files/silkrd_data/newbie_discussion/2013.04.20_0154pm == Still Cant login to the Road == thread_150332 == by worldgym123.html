				Started to show the header, and now I can see my account still has $0 even though I transferred almost 12 hours ago, but the page won&#039;t continue loading.&nbsp; It seems I was still logged in from 12 hours ago too -- I had the same tor browser opened and didn&#039;t turn off the computer.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t make me login.. huh.&nbsp; Oh the account page is almost done loading..&nbsp; guess I&#039;ll check back tonight.&nbsp; I know the transaction will go through eventually since the block data is public and infinite, for all to see..&nbsp; once they finish downloading all of the blocks that is.

				My balance finally restored to what it should be.&nbsp; SR is moving slow, but it&#039;s moving. <br /><br />Another question: I want to upload a pic for my profile, if I get an image from Google images and upload it do I still have to use one of those programs that removes meta data from the pic? Or is it ok as long as it&#039;s not a pic from my phone/camera?
