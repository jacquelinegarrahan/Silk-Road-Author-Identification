				I&#039;ve been trying&nbsp; my best to make worthwhile posts so I can get up to my 50. I&#039;ve refrained from spamming because I don&#039;t want to make this newbie board a bigger cesspool of bullshit and spam -- at least not more than it already is -- but it&#039;s becoming more and more tempting. I understand the need for the limit (preventing spammers from constantly making new accounts etc.) but 50 posts? That&#039;s a lot -- 20-25 seems reasonable.

				Whether or not you choose to spam isn&#039;t going to make a difference. In fact a topic like this only makes it worse. As long as the spam is confined into certain threads than it should really hamper the usability of the newbie forum. However creating threads like this that serve no real purpose actually do.

				Why is there a stigma attached to spamming to 50? As long as it is confined to a single thread, then I do not see any problem with it.

				Yeah, 50 is quite steep. Especially seeing as most of the best threads are outside of the newbie section. So what are you planning on discussing while on the way to 50?
