				Hey, so i placed a large order of weed from a 1% vendor. The tracking today shows that it was an Undeliverable as Addressed, probably because it is a small apartment box.... BUT! the day before there was a notice of &quot;notice left&quot; which would have instructed me to go to the post office to pick it up(however this has happened before, they told me its when they dont have time to get to it all). Now, the vendor says that this is normal and it happens once every 2 weeks. He says I should go to the post office and pick it up with the tracking number. What do you guys think? :/<br /><br />Please advise/ ease my nerves.. This is a top 1% vendor he says he&#039;s never had a CD or anything

				It happens ALOT. Vendor&#039;s should say somewhere how big ur mailbox should be..... Ask the vendor if u will have to sign / show id... Thats a no no. (even though u will be alright as they often have no idea whats inside, it stilll leaves a paper trail to you.) If u can get the package with just the tracking number go for it bro. If u rly wanna get high that is

				I&#039;m no expert my any means, but this does not sound like a CD. Just a common hiccup in the USPS. <br /><br />I&#039;d trust your vendor, he does this shit for a living.

				As it says on the Vendor Wiki, USPS needs a search warrant to open your package. I doubt they went to the trouble in the day since the notice was left. I&#039;d suggest smoking out first if you are gonna be all nervous about it.

Just think how freaked out you would be; now - after the fact, if this were happening and you had gone with a sketchy vendor.
