				I&#039;m not an expert on the matter, but I&#039;ll give you my thoughts anyway.<br /><br />First of all, a new car for 4-5K euro? Not where I live, unless it&#039;s a scooter with a roof or something.<br /><br />You can sell bitcoins for cash, but you already knew that. You should easily be able to buy a secondhand car (even one in good nick) and pay cash. Much easier to hide it&#039;s actual value from the authorities this way. Even if you have to report the amount you bought it for (probably depends on country), you could buy it for 2K and give the seller another 2K with a wink. Maybe you got a bargain, maybe you&#039;re a good negotiator, who would ever know.<br /><br />If you&#039;re buying new from a dealer, you could consider some arrangement where instead of paying the whole sum at once, you do monthly payments. Smaller amounts, not nearly as suspect.<br /><br />Small amounts of cash can also be explained when you say you&#039;ve sold your old television or a painting and the buyer paid cash.<br /><br />If you also have some sort of legitimate income, get all of it out of the bank and pay everything cash. If you can pay your rent in cash, your groceries, your restaurant visits and the downpayments for your car, it&#039;s going to be much harder to figure out you&#039;re spending more than your (official) income.

				In your place I would not be to concerned about an invest from 4-5k for a car, Its an amount nobody accusing you for running illegal operations ;-)<br />Ok I dont know your origin but I can talk for AT, DE and RO. In Italy they are quite more tuff, but still we are talking from max 5k which is not an amount to raise any alerts.<br /><br />
