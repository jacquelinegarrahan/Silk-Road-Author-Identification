				So, just to start this thread/post off, I would like to clarify that what is discussed/stated by me are not definitive in any way, shape, or form. I have yet to verify my claims with a third-party lab. I am in no way denying validity/legitimacy of the vendor LegitSacks, or his product (25i or otherwise). In fact, his communications and shipping are 5/5. His AM-2201 is phenomenal.<br /><br />That being clarified, let the discussion begin...<br /><br />So, I recently purchased a gram (1.0g) of 25i-NBOMe (or at least what was advertised/sold as such...going to get independent lab testing done to verify either truth or scam) and a general common dose size is in the ballpark range of 500ug to 700ug. I dose myself and others at 1000ug (1mg; 0.001g). However, even with the vendors lab results I have to show purity at 98%+, I have done what SHOULD be 3 to 5 doses with no visual stimuli whatsoever. Visual hallucinations (OEV AND CEV both) are non-existent. This report has been echoed by multiple dissatisfied clients and business associates.&nbsp; I supply a head shop with this product since it is legal, and have not placed this batch on shelves as of yet due to these negative reports thus forth. Can anyone else provide a report regarding this vendor and their 25i? Also, can anyone be given a sample to get proper lab testing done (HNMR, MS/GC, MS/LC, etc.) of any type (even if not too extensive, just needed for validating the chemical compound and its purity)? I will gladly send it, shipping paid by yours truly of course, and include funds (either with the shipped product sample or via WU or MoneyGram. Any other payment methods, please inbox me). I just need a reliable PROPER testing done, not just dosing and seeing what happens, burning on a foil to check relative melting point, etc.. Thank you in advance for all feedback and all offers to test! I would prefer to have results back within 48 hours of reception of the product by whoever is testing for me, if not possible, a week (SEVEN DAYS, not a week-ISH) would be tolerable. If neither time frame can be done, give me a quote on time before I get results back. I can work with you. This will be copied to another thread on a non-newb board. But I have to still spam for like 30 more posts to get non-newb status again, since I have barely been active on the Forums.<br /><br />Also, the lab report (HPLC type) from the vendor is available for review if inquired about.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance!<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />The Good Doctor

He has evem gone as far as to drop his listings for 25i, as I am the first client who purchased it, and he has his first complaint on it. I do vouch for his AM-2201 though! Great quality/price! I hope his Molly is up to par as well. Honest vendor who just wants to please clients! He has pleased this one, and will satisfy me fully when he releases my money to me. Will update upon full resolution! (btw, he was who offered this solution, and took his listings down the moment he read my initial PM. His goal is to satisfy!)

I have never been a customer of yours, so I am not as privy to buying a product I have not tested first. Especially with the common issue of scammers using other vendors reputations by making accounts with similar names, claiming it is a new/alternate page. I am in no way insinuating/assuming this is the case here, but I am just apt to be safe, rather than sorry. I have a previous experience with 25i from many sources around the world, of varying qualities. So, this means I can provide a veteran opinion/assessment of your product that many people lack. What say you, brother? (: We can mutually benefit from this, and I would be inclined to purchase from you regularly if price/product is up to par!

But, I have seen this several times on threads I have read (originally reviewing a new vendor) that you have posted your product in attempts to draw customers from a new vendor to yourself. This is NOT a good practice and is completely uncalled for. There are plenty of places for you to plug your products, but other vendors pages is not it. I have no respect for someone that is essentially trying to steal customers. As you stated, you are already a well respected vendor, so there is no need for you to try to bully others out of the market. Let your product stand for itself and let the new vendors try to establish a name for themselves. I feel like this should be practiced by every vendor. The only reason you, google, are targeted in this post is because I have seen it too many times by you. Things tend to get very nasty on the street when people try to pull this kind of shit. It may just have negative consequences on the internet as well. Don&#039;t take that as a threat, just reminding you of the nature of business you are in.<br /><br />To you Legit, I appreciate what you have done for me and hope the best for your future here.<br /><br />Empathy 101, who were you referring to as far as a stolen account? Also, how does that happen?
