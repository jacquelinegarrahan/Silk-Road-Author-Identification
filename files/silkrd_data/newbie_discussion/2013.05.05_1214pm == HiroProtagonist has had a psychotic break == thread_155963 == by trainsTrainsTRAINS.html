				I guess his stuff was really really good.<br /><br />Wanted to buy from him and just pulled up a few of his listings - they all say this:<br /><br /><br />------begin worrying text---------<br /><br />Description<br /><br />This listing is no longer for sale.<br /><br />I am not selling poison anymore.<br /><br />Try to imagine what it is to risk everything to accumulate more than $500,000 worth of product, only to realize how wrong it is, and to flush all that time and effort down the toilet.<br /><br />If you knew what I know you would not be taking poison anymore. If a poisoner like me can get clean through the grace of God, anyone can. If you think you have done bad things, I have done worse.<br /><br />I have raped and murdered.<br /><br />Yet when I bit out the flesh of my own wrists and threw myself into a secluded, frozen river, God brought me back from death.<br /><br />My body was 33 degrees when I was brought unconscious into the hospital.<br /><br />God has shown me in an unequivocal way that we can be freed from sin and born again through the Son. If you are like I have been, and not among the faithful or the observant, all you need do is pray and God will answer.<br /><br />I will conclude by saying that you cannot imagine how much better you will feel to be sober. If you are using you are walking a thin line between life and death and your Judgement Day may be close at hand.<br /><br />Believe me when I say that you do not want to lift up that veil to the other side when your house is not in order. Make haste now so that you may yet learn of true happiness and joy, which is the love and compassion God has for us all.<br /><br />Hail Mary, full of grace.<br />Our Lord is with thee.<br />Blessed art thou among women,<br />and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,<br />Jesus.<br />Holy Mary, Mother of God,<br />pray for us sinners,<br />now and at the hour of our death.<br />Amen. <br /><br />--------Is this dude OK?------------<br /><br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/773c4cc539<br />if you wanna see for yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Damn.&nbsp; I like amphetamines

				I think we can safely rule out &quot;oh it&#039;s just someone that has access to their account(s) pulling a prank on them&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s been up for several days... and a sane vendor, (one that you might trust w/ your address lets say), would have removed the joke by now and offered an explanation.<br /><br />Anyone wanna message Hiro/Neil and post back here their response?&nbsp; Personally, I don&#039;t even want them to know my SR acct. name&nbsp; :o

				SR is most definitely an answer to prayer, for a lot of people, praise God he has allowed it, so be careful how you use it ;)<br /><br />On another note, concerning Hiro, what he is saying sounds legit, the guy tried to kill himself, and he miraculously lived...so if his story sounds wierd to you, let me tell you mine, perphaps they sound similar....<br /><br />Driving 80 + mph with a friend, slid off the road into a tree, dead on, into a tree....and walked away without a scratch on me, neither him or me.&nbsp; You can say, oh you lucky duck, but get this, during that split second of impact, where my brains &amp; skull should have smashed into the steering wheel, and me and my buddy lunged forward at whatever &quot;insert math calculation here&quot; speed you get when going from 80 mph to dead stop...something happened.&nbsp; Theres was this ball of energy surrounding us (we were not on drugs), protecting us, for just that split moment when we should have died, and because of it, no harm happened to us.&nbsp; I mean, we seriously did not even move.&nbsp; My hands where still on the steering wheel, exactly where they were, before we hit the tree, I didn&#039;t move a single inch.&nbsp; Same place in the seat, everything.&nbsp; It was as if I just parked the car, not hit a tree at 80 mph.&nbsp; It was indeed a miracle.&nbsp; And we walked away with no scratches, pains, or even LE showing up, just walked away, as if it never happened.&nbsp; &nbsp;But...it did happen....and then something else happened.....<br /><br />Call it coincidence, but God did some life saving in the story I just told, just like it appears he did with Hiro.&nbsp; But heres were our stories start to sound even more similar.&nbsp; &nbsp;Shortly after God saved my life, through a series of events, He brought me face to face with someone named Jesus, let&#039;s call Him the truth.&nbsp; Call it religous if you want, but I&#039;m not religous, and contrary to popular belief, neither is Jesus.&nbsp; Jesus is simply mans way out of this mess we live in day after day, hes the escape route from the prison, were you are facing the death penalty... God really does love what he made, aka his creation (that includes you), ask anyone on lsd they will tell you evolution is a joke, and something definetly created this world we live in.....that creator, as big and powerful as He is, became a man, for a short time, to pay for our debts, to break us out of jail if you will, see thats why Jesus was crucified.&nbsp; He was killed in our place.&nbsp; He took the bullet for YOU, and those who look to Him for redemption, they get saved forever.&nbsp; Theres no other means of escaping hell to be real with you.&nbsp; Drugs are a temporary fix, whether its for sickness or pain, or just to escape reality.&nbsp; But Jesus is a permanent fix, for all eternity.&nbsp; Sometimes God has to save a persons life, before He will save their soul.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad for Hiro...and anyone who finds the truth about Christ and believes in Him.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you think drugs get you high, imagine whats it like to have God living inside of you.&nbsp; Its a supernatural high and I&#039;m calling every man here to come take this flight, call on Christ, and be high for life! :)<br /><br />Forget everything you thought you ever knew about God, most people who call themselves Christians are liars, turning men away from the truth.&nbsp; And religious people are a joke as you probably know.&nbsp; If you want accurate information, you need to go to the source, and go to God, the author of all things true.&nbsp; Talk to Him one on one, you can get through to him through the name of Jesus.&nbsp; Call on Him and he will hear you, no matter what you&#039;ve done.&nbsp; In Christ you will find forgiveness for everything you&#039;ve done wrong.&nbsp; And through Christ you can stand before God BLAMELESS.&nbsp; Because that which we call death, Christ CONQUERED it.&nbsp; Thats why He rose from the dead.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t just die and there he lay, he died, and in that realm of existence where dead souls go, Jesus fought the powers of death and hell head on, and He won.&nbsp; No one else could do that but Him, because in Him was ALL of God, thats why He&#039;s called Gods son.&nbsp; If you think you can take on all the powers of death and hell yourself, you are wrong.&nbsp; But Jesus already overcame it all, and he offers redemption to anyone.&nbsp; The Bible says &quot;its the gift of God&quot;.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to work for it at all.&nbsp; You just ask Him, you ask Jesus to save you, and when you believe your heart, He will come into you, and never leave.&nbsp; And if God is inside of you forever, guess where you go when you die?&nbsp; You definitely won&#039;t be going to hell.&nbsp; &nbsp; It would be wise to learn about Christ before its too late for you, because hell is real, and its pain is forever; but Heaven is also real, and forever, and the joy thereof is too :)

As far as we can possibly claim to reasonably know, the life of a consciousness appears to cease permanently upon death. Not only are you not going to be punished or rewarded after you die but it will be over when you die, so it would probably be best to figure out what &quot;a good life for me&quot; means to you ASAP and then pursue it as best as you possibly can.
