				Hello SR Community,<br /><br />I am curious if anyone knows (roughly) the amphetamine content of ICE speed pills.<br />I&#039;ve had gone through a few batches of them this year, and I assume they are pretty consistently manufactured.<br /><br />In case there is more variance that I realize, I&#039;d like to know for the ones mrouid provides (from Canada).<br /><br />I am particularly interested, because I read another post that included some good information about recommended amphetamine doses, for minimizing tolerance as well as long-term damage.<br /><br />I`m relatively new to speed, and I&#039;d like to get the best out of my usage.<br /><br />If nothing else, I&#039;ll post the guidelines I have come up with for myself, in hopes that it may help other newbs (like myself).<br />I&#039;d like to learn from others that are probably a lot more knowledgeable than me about speed usage though, and update accordingly.<br /><br />ICE<br />

				Without further ado, recommendations based on my experiences:<br /><br />Assuming no existing tolerance to amphetamines, a half a pill would be a good starting dose.<br />If you have little experience with stimulants, it may be a bit intense at first.<br /><br />For me, the dose was just right (I experimented with 5-10 mg Dexedrine a couple weeks prior, but I wanted something a little stronger; I&#039;d be curious to try 20mg of Adderall, but imagine I&#039;d need at least 30mg to get where I want to be).<br /><br />However, I find Rx amphetamines to be quite pricey.<br /><br />Note:&nbsp; I weigh ~175lbs (80kg), so scale to your weight accordingly.&nbsp; From what I understand, there should little-to-no neuro-toxicity with anything less than a single 1mg/kg dose.<br /><br />After a couple hours, euphoria turns to feeling of unease, for which I have two general strategies:<br />1)&nbsp; Ride it out<br />2)&nbsp; Re-dose<br /><br />In either scenario, I find having alcohol on hand helps to take the edge off a bit.<br /><br />If I re-dose the second half, I find it is not nearly as effective as the original dose (if you&#039;re going to re-dose though, it is probably ideal to do so, somewhere in the 2-4 hour range).&nbsp; Binge users can re-dose every 2-4 hours for days, but I haven&#039;t gone that far; and don&#039;t think that&#039;s something I will be aspiring to...<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;d need to step it up to whole pills by your third dose, due to tolerance, and I don&#039;t know how how long that would remain effective.&nbsp; I usually crush and snort for re-doses, which I find allows finer-grained control over your doses.<br /><br />The pills are quite hard.&nbsp; I use a manual hand grinder with metal teeth (head shops usually sell them to grind weed).<br />I generally need to split a pill in half on one of the teeth first (and even then it&#039;s a tough go).<br /><br />That&#039;ll get it crushed down to small pebbles.&nbsp; If anyone&#039;s tried the Pill Grinder that plutopete sells on SR.<br />I&#039;m hoping to find a more easy-going solution.<br /><br />For those new to powders, here&#039;s some pointers I&#039;ve picked up over the years:<br />1) Use a smooth reflective surface, like glass; a mirror; the bottom of a CD, etc.<br />2) Clean it with glass cleaner (this will help prevent nasal infections)<br />3) Pour your pebbles onto the surface a lay a dollar bill over top<br />4) Take a thin plastic card and rub it firmly over the bill, crushing the pebbles underneath<br />5) Dice and sift through the powder with the card, and repeat until it&#039;s to your liking<br /><br />I then measure the doses by continuously dividing the piles by two, until I have powdered lines that are about 1/8 of a pill each.<br />I&#039;d start with an 1/8 up each nostril and then see how you feel.<br /><br />Good things to sniff through:<br />1) A glass or metal tube (another typical head-shop item)<br />2) A rolled up dollar bill (or similar width paper)<br />3) Cut a straw in half<br /><br />After the initial inhale, there&#039;ll still be a fair amount in your nose.&nbsp; You&#039;ll probably need to take another few deep sniffs to get the rest up there over the next few minutes.&nbsp; Best to get the over with before going back into the public (depending on setting).&nbsp; <br /><br />You should feel a little bit trickle into the back of your throat.&nbsp; A great time to get yourself a drink.<br />This stuff is pretty gentle compared to other things I&#039;ve sniffed.<br /><br />At this point, it becomes a balancing act of reaching the height you like and maintaining it, while keeping in mind how much you have left and when you&#039;re ready to wind the session down.<br /><br />I like to reduce the amount on the last few doses (i.e. take the last two eighths as singles rather than doubles).<br /><br />I find that going through any more than 2 pills in a night leaves me feeling like my heart has been overworked the next day.<br />It may be an uncomfortable feeling, but don&#039;t panic.&nbsp; You&#039;ll just need to take it easy the next day.<br /><br />You may also consider smoking pot or taking a benzo at the end of the night.&nbsp; I will likely experiment with the liquid alprazolam (xanax) solution that canadiansunshine provides, in the relatively near future.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a lot of experience with benzos, but that looks like the best deal to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note: most of the benzos I&#039;ve seen on SR are on the high-end of the therapeutic dose range (and not recommended to mix with alcohol).&nbsp; The golden rule: start low, until you know what you&#039;re doing..<br /><br />I don`t have any words of wisdom in terms of frequency, other than I like to take a day off after two consecutive days using, and taking a least a week off, every couple weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;ll post again, when I add benzos to the mix.<br /><br />ICE<br />
