				So I have created another SR account and given mine to my mate called Bob because it had really excellent stats so Bob could further run the business.<br /><br />Now I find more people are asking to FE and I suspect Im getting fucked over a little. <br /><br />Has anyone else been a possible victim of this just because they are new SR members?<br /><br />WW

				Try contacting the vendors you did business with your old account and let them know you changed accounts and you should be ok.<br /><br />With a completely new account you are going to have limited options till you build yourself up again. <br /><br />Just do not FE.

				Seems newbies have a much higher chance of getting scammed as most scammers happen to be newbies but leaves a large possibility even for established vendors to rip them off... as one such vendor states &quot;If your 1 out of 20 people complaining about not receiving product then you will be ignored&quot; ... that just gives an open license to abuse if the person has such moral capacitance that they feel they are in the right and keep a low profile by ripping off every 20th person as long as that person is not established enough on the road to be deemed not credible enough to be believed.&nbsp; I have high hopes for everything though!
