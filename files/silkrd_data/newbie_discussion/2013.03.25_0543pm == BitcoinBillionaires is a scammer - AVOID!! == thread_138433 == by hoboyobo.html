				This guy is a scammer, I put the same post on another thread but the title is misleading, here&#039;s my story:<br /><br />I sent him a £150 Ukash voucher on Wednesday night, he had 100% feedback and I felt confident dealing with him.<br /><br />I contacted BitcoinBillionaires on Thursday after no coins appeared in my wallet, he claimed that he was having problems getting on SR and the coins would be with me today.<br /><br />After still no coins on Friday I contacted him again and he said everything was running smoothly and I&#039;d have my coins later that day, sound familiar?<br /><br />Saturday came and still no coins, after seeing that guys had left him 1/5 I (desperately) messaged him saying that if I received just 2 coins (£75 each!!) I would leave 5/5 feedback and remove all my comments from the forum. He replied on Sunday morning and said it was no problem and I&#039;d have my coins today.&nbsp;<br /><br />I messaged him again on Sunday afternoon after I removed all my forum comments and actually FE&#039;d (only 0.01btc)!! I know that wasn&#039;t the best thing to do but as UKash is out of escrow I was willing to try anything and hoped he&#039;d have the decency to give me even half the coins I was owed. The message was read but I got no reply. At this point I decided to message him on another account asking for UKash rates, he replied in 4mins saying £50 a bitcoin, it seems he has no problem relying or getting on SR when he&#039;s receiving money.<br /><br />I messaged him again this morning asking for just 2 bitcoins, read but no reply. I then messaged him on my other account with a UKash question and got a reply within a few mins.&nbsp;<br /><br />The thing that really got me was he posted on his sellers page that we were all lying and were trouble makers! He scams people and then calls them liars in public!<br /><br />I have screen shots of all the communication in case he tries to lie again, I&#039;ll also be sending him a link to this post but I doubt he&#039;ll even bother to defend himself.<br /><br />AVOID THIS SCAMMER NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS!!

				Did you report him using the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on his profile page?&nbsp; I let Vendor Support know about the other threads, so hopefully they&#039;ll look into it.

				Scout, can we please have this guy shut down! Someone else is going to get scammed! Look at his ridiculous feedback and his vendor page. He is relying on the fact SR haven&#039;t shut him down to prove his legitimacy.

				&quot;Get over it!&quot; ???&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; People were scammed out of their money and I&#039;m glad you had better luck, but that doesn&#039;t give you the right to tell those who lost money to &quot;get over it&quot;!&nbsp;

				Why would anyone want to lie about being scammed? Funny how every comment on here saying this guy is legit is from accounts are from people who registered on the 26th March and then posted within 15 minutes of registering. It&#039;s a shame to know someone was taken for £1000 just a few hours ago by this diabolical cunt.

				frankfurta68 i completely agree!<br /><br />Ive been a member for well over a year now and reguarly deal with vendors like SLL, sonni, and cannabuy, Vendors who only deal with regulars and know their customers. Vendors who dont accept new customers and I have never had any problems. I have nothing but praise for the road....that was untill tuesday afternoon.<br /><br />I sent a ukash code to bitcoinbillionaires looking for coins just as all this was unfolding, never seen the coins, never had a reply to any of my 7 messages, and will never recieve either. Luckily it was only for two coins so it could have been worse, but hes still a thief.......<br /><br />Whats pissing me off is assholes telling everyone all the negative reviews are from one person, absolute rubbish, tbh the last positive reviews were obviously from the vendor, or those he knows who were also in the scam... including the last &quot;shining stars&quot; hestotallylegit and btcbillionairesarelegit....who the hell do you think your fooling???<br /><br />I have screenshots of messages etc and ive read others have as well, yet to see any evidence supporting this scammer has sent any coins to anyone, but im sure all those transactions that &quot;hestotallylegit&quot; has completed can be posted on here??<br /><br />&quot;hestotallylegit&quot; If your chatting to him again send him my best, hope he isnt tooooo stressed stealing everyones&nbsp; money, but he has our support to give in to the stress and drink a liter of bleach or something and do us all the favour of opening up another account today and starting the scam all over again......<br /><br />Seen this morning that either admin has shut him down or he has realised the scam is up, but as ive said wouldn&#039;t be shocked to see a new vendor offering the same services for the same rates in the near future....<br /><br /><br /><br />
