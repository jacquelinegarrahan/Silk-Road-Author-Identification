				&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Hi Everyone, <br /><br />Made an order with BusinessAsAlways and I was a couple dollars short in my bitcoin account for postage so I asked if he could send order 42cent snail mail instead and he said sure, send me the bitcoin you have and I will send out item today with tracking #, priority mail, that sounded legit because he had 95% rating so I did and I never heard back from the guy again, he is a thief, STAY AWAY! <br />I have proof of this with my messages with this thief and have reported him to Silk Road.<br />I guess a 95% rating on Silk Road means Ripoff, only 100% can be trusted!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the heads up. How long did you give him to respond? Some vendors take a day or two. <br /><br />Did your order status ever get changed?

				I hate it when this happens. I see it way to often on here, although there are some great vendors here also. Was this your 1st order with him?

				hmm he came through for me several times. though this last order something did not &quot;feel&quot; right. he had asked me to FE early for him to ship out that day, and it had been a day since i made order so idk what to think there. Also his shipping was just terrible the product was loose and was everywhere inside package. definatley a panic set in for me.&nbsp; &gt;:( so i dont know the quality to was pretty low, i am just like whatever you live and you learn no point in getting all defensive and pissed about it.
