				This is long overdue...with SR being down and smoking on this Blue Dream Haze &amp; Ogre Kush ....so here it is..<br /><br />Communication: (5/5) I spoke to this vendor a few times through messages - each time he was extremely personable and responded within a short period of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stealth/Shipping: (5/5) It was awesome.&nbsp; Multiple layers with clever packaging.&nbsp; No smell at all...then...then you break the last vacume open...and the smell!! Whoa!&nbsp; That&#039;s another story though ;)&nbsp; Arrived fast! Ordered Thursday and was delivered Saturday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Appearance: (5/5) The bag appeal on both of these buds are insane! Both were perfectly trimmed, perfectly cured,&nbsp; dense as hell, covered in so many trichs.&nbsp; <br />-- BDH&nbsp; - Light green and coated in crystals. Brown-orange colored hairs.<br />-- Ogre - Not a light green but not dark; it is a a mixture of tones of green with dark orange-brown hairs<br /><br />Smell: (5/5) <br />BDH - Slight hashy smell but mostly sweet.&nbsp; Breaking this in the cracker is pure joy.&nbsp; It is so sticky...the smell comes out even more now.&nbsp; very sweet!<br />Ogre - Musty like OG and earthy as well.&nbsp; Very dank!<br /><br />Smoke &amp; High: (5/5)<br />BDH - Very uplifting...but still with an intense body high.&nbsp; It lasts for more than 3 hours...no cominig down issues at all.&nbsp; I took one pull off a little bowl and was more than fine!<br />Ogre - BOOM!&nbsp; Be ready! haha one toke and you&#039;re out.&nbsp; It hits you pretty hard.&nbsp; Perfect for night time smoking.&nbsp; I have been taking a few pulls about 30 minutes before going to bed and I get the best sleep.<br /><br />Over all I would have to say BSRE gets a 10/5 lol â€“ They will hopefully be my go to for bud from now on!

				Thanks for the thread, lookingfor.&nbsp; Check my review thread for more info and updates on what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; My inventory is nearly depleted but harvest time is rapidly approaching.&nbsp; What listings I do have available will be back this coming Tuesday.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Well folks, it is almost that time again!<br /><br />I just wanted to give a heads-up that my listings for Blue Dream and Ogre Kush will be back up mid-week next week (first week of June).&nbsp; Everything is currently curing, and in another few days it&#039;ll be good enough to sell to y&#039;all. <br /><br />Have a good weekend, see ya soon!

				And we&#039;re back!&nbsp; Listings are back up, and I have a new option available for those who want a little more than my normal ounce: the Dank Sack.&nbsp; For a premium, I will look through and select an ounce of large, beautiful buds for your smoking pleasure.&nbsp; I realize this won&#039;t be for everyone, which is why I&#039;m only offering a few, but I&#039;ve had a couple requests for something similar so here they are!&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course my normal listings are still there, so have at &#039;em!&nbsp; The few weeks I was gone were not wasted, much work was done and within a few months we will all be reaping the rewards!<br /><br />It feels good to be back :D
