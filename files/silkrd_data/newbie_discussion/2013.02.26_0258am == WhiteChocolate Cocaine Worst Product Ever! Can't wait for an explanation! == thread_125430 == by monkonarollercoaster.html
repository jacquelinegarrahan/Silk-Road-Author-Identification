				I feel weird about posting this before hearing back from the vendor but this product is so bad I feel the need to warn you all!&nbsp; There may be some cocaine in it but not much, no more than 5% is my guess at this point.&nbsp; I have blown through most the four grams myself in the last three hours and I will be in pain from doing so no doubt.&nbsp; It took twelve days to get the order delivered which would be forgivable if the product was good but it is far from good and I only keep blowing lines because I have built up such a hankering over the time it took to get this crap over here.&nbsp; I attempted twice to make freebase with this stuff too which has shown an alarming issue: most of this product is made of some kind of inert pulp like substance which gelled up all of the liquid several minutes after the time oil should have been appearing on the surface of the water.&nbsp; No oil ever did appear and no rock was produced!&nbsp; Smoking the pulp did produce a slight buzz where it was able to be smoked.&nbsp; Most of it just sits in the pipe and doesn&#039;t melt or produce smoke at all.&nbsp; That second attempt at freebase (done just in case I fucked up somehow on the first attempt) used up the last of the product.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be resolved quickly and hopefully it was not the intention of White Chocolate to send out this garbage.. but none the less it should never have been sent out in the first place!&nbsp; I will keep you all updated as events unfold.

				Good day, <br /><br />This is my first post on the forum, as it took time to get settled in. I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself on the forum, followed by that explain some of the complaints. First off thank you for all the customers who bought from the last two weeks, and giving me the opportunity to at least show them, that I do care about my customers. <br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Without giving much of my anonymity away, let me explain to you why I am here in the first place.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not a street drug dealer, in fact I am a white collar, the reason I am here is because my child&#039;s education fund got wiped in stock market because of bad policies from current and previous president.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, in real life I am a business man and not a street drug dealer. So why am I telling you this? I am telling you this because I am trying to earn business here, not rip anyone off! This is the sole reason why I have provided customer service like no other, and ensured my stealth was recognized as one of the best out here. <br /><br />2. The batch that I received, was vouched from a very credible source,&nbsp; in fact when the first batch went out I received negative and positive response, so that told me obviously every nose is different and everyone&#039;s preferences are different.&nbsp; When the second batch was received, I haven&#039;t tasted from the second batch, I assumed it was the same, but based on what I heard from some customers,&nbsp; it was re-cut and rerocked.&nbsp; &nbsp;I personally do not cut or re rock anything, I pick up from the source and I bring it here.&nbsp; A lesson learned from this is,&nbsp; do a purity test and post the results on the posting.&nbsp; I have ordered purity and cut tester from EZTEST.COM when the new batch comes in it will be tested and the results will be on the listing. That is the sole reason why I did not post a new listing, this week, because I am awaiting for a tester to come in so I can do my tests. If anyone can recommend a better way to test so I don&#039;t have to wait for the tester to get here , by all means, I am willing to listen. <br /><br />3.&nbsp; Let me explain to you one thing, when I opened up an account I had to set up a bond. If i was here to rip anyone off, I wouldn&#039;t respond to this post,&nbsp; nor I would respond back to my customers privately. I have listened to my customers and I responded back accordingly and that agreement is private between myself and my customers. In fact without really knowing how good or bad the product was, I set the price lower then a street price. There was a reason for this, it was done to earn some business and to show that I am legitimate. Yes I understand some people are skeptical because they thought product quality was shit, well that was lesson learned from me. If you guys want to know the truth, I set the price and I paid out of pocket for express mail shipping, what I am trying to tell you with this is,&nbsp; I was investing in myself and this new venture and was willing to even sell it at a loss to earn credibility. <br /><br />4. I dont care about the criticism, because criticism is what makes bad to good and good to better. I will take criticism about product, packaging, and quality of product,&nbsp; but I will not take any criticism from anyone who privately messages me and tells me how I should be running my business. <br /><br />5. Listing is going down, until the new batch comes in. There will also be a posting on my profile later on with updates.&nbsp; As for the bad taste in mouth by few people, let me express my Apologies. I apologize, I should ve tasted the second round before I post it online. I trusted to the source and that source is now dropped altogether. <br /><br />There are things that I agree should be done by every vendor but there are few things that I disagree with. <br /><br />1. I will do everything as stated in my profile to keep it as stealth as possible. One thing about me is I come from information security world, so I know a thing or two about stealth, and I will continue to thrive in that department. <br /><br />2. I&nbsp; will respond and listen to my customers and I did,&nbsp; I kept in touch the way I should<br /><br />3. I will come to a resolution on certain things, and I expect the customer to be fair and to be within a reason. <br /><br />4. I am basically running this business as legit business, regardless of the risks that are involved. <br /><br />4. I DO NOT SELL ANY FAKE!&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who labels it as fake is fucking with my integrity, it could ve been low quality, but I will not sell fake! As I said, I found this as a good source for me to get my life back together I will&nbsp; not jeopordize my credibility on few transactions.&nbsp; <br /><br />My one big rule!<br /><br />&nbsp;I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANYONE, WHO DICTATES ME HOW I SHOULD BE RUNNING MY BUSINESS!<br />I RESPECT EVERYONE&#039;s ANONIMITY, AND I RESPECT THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE ME BUSINESS! AND I AM ALWAYS LOYAL TO THE CUSTOMERS WHO GIVE ME BUSINESS. IN FACT, I AM SO GOD DAMN LOYAL, I GAVE EVERYONE EXTRA&#039;S. THIS IS HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS!&nbsp; IF I WAS A RIPPER LIKE someone on this forum is labeling me as I wouldn&#039;t even take my time to respond to any of this. <br /><br />I have came to resolution with my customers and I keep that private, I will not publicize what kind of agreement I came with my customers. That&nbsp; is strictly private and will be kept that way<br /><br />-I will prevail and I will prove that this is not some JOE SHMOE operation!<br /><br />Thank you again and I am looking forward to serving you again soon!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />WC

How do you know what it was if you never tested it or even tried any of it? If someone is trying to freebase it and not getting any rock, just a load of &quot;gel&quot; type stuff, and if it mostly not water soluble... then there is very little cocaine in it (if any). If you list that as &quot;HQ Cocaine&quot; then that is a fake listing... but I totally get that you probably weren&#039;t doing it intentionally.<br /><br />There are a multitude of research chemicals out there that could be cut with some crap and passed off as cocaine, and you admit yourself you never tested it, so really you can&#039;t say for sure what you were selling. That&#039;s not an attack on your integrity, it&#039;s an attack on your product. It could easily have been done in good faith by you and still be &quot;fake&quot;.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s a paragraph of caps lock (shouting) about what you won&#039;t stand for, when from the looks of it you may have sold some people some dodgy crap by accident. It doesn&#039;t look good. <br /><br />Anyway I hope it&#039;s just a teething problem for you and it all gets worked out, best of luck :)

				I promised to keep you all updated and that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to do right now.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t feel like posting right now and I still feel reserved about sharing more details mostly because I don&#039;t want to be thinking about this awful set of events right now.&nbsp; I have a busy day ahead of me and need to keep my head in the game (in real life).&nbsp; The purpose of this post is very simply to tell you all that the vendor hasn&#039;t yet made the situation right.&nbsp; If anything he made it worse.&nbsp; I have been counting down the days until an auto finalize would occur if I did not place this transaction into resolution and time has now run out.&nbsp; The vendor has refused to refund the order but now that will be his only option.&nbsp; The only choice he has left is whether he will continue to waste my time and energy as well as that of the staff or if he will man up and do the minimum of what should be done (a full refund) without further confrontation (and there has been plenty already).&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW <br />All the things that the vendor didn&#039;t want to explain to you I can likely answer for you in a much more pleasant manor than he did for me.. I will probably wind up doing that and more.. but not right now. <br /><br />Thanks Everyone for stopping by and especially for sticking up for me, showing you support, your concern, and your disgust.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to know that a few good hearts out there actually do care.

				It really sucks when something like this happens.<br />i do hope you will be able to work it out.<br />if not it will be to the vendor&#039;s bad profiling and reputation for not only giving out product which was not tested,as he claims, but also for not making it up to you.<br /><br />
