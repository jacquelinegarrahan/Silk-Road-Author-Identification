				Hello SR community.<br /><br />I have been lurking the fourms since using this place for its various services since Febuary of last year.<br />At that time we had an Armory, but I with it gone I cant hire any services to take care of these people with violence. And after much thought<br />I dont want to.<br /><br />They live in another state, and the reason Im choosing to do this, is for getting about $1000 stole from my wallet when partying with them. Then when I was out of town for 3 days, they came by and intercepted 3 larges orders out of my mail. A christ vial by JOR, 50 pot edibles (which were for a friend with leukemia) and 100 pills from an XTC vendor.<br /><br />They then called the police on me. Who didnt have a warrant upon approaching my property, so like any good American I told them to leave until they had one. It bought me enough time to get rid of all narcotics and mail packages via campfire in my back yard.<br /><br />I want revenge. Ive considered everything from robbing them at gunpoint to hiring a hit man. But atlast, I cant bring myself to do either. Instead, them dressing like the typical pusedo hippies they are, and using SR for themselves. I expect they have fell back into being comfortable (they went on the run and hid from me for months) by now. Have a house with drugs and scales in it, and dress very profiled to a T.<br /><br />If I were to send them multiple packages of Pot and wanted them to get caught, what would be the best mail carrier to use, and how should I tip off law enforcement officers in their home town to make sure this happens smoothly as planned.<br /><br />+Karma for all intelligent and useful answers<br /><br />Thanks very much in advance.<br /><br />

				Revenge is not the way, karma will bite you in the ass, besides that they can just refuse the packages, also if they are aware of this thread they can point to it to show the police you were trying to frame them. just my .0002 btc

				That&#039;s not the way to go, because then you&#039;d just be putting yourself out their to get busted. If you can&#039;t see them face to face then is revenge even the way to go? If I couldn&#039;t get my hands on the motherfucker who screwed me over because they lived in a different state I would either go to them or just let it go.<br />

				I say just be more vigilant with receiving packages, and don&#039;t carry tons of money with you at parties. Revenge isn&#039;t worth it, even if you wanted to mail them weed you would need a ton of weed and hope it gets flagged.

				man, definitely do not ship them drugs to get them busted. did you not file a police report about the $1000 in cash, theft of US mail (which is a felony) and the breaking and entering? If it&#039;s too late for that, try and find them and confront them. Let the people they deal with know that they are swindlers and should not be dealt with. They will eventually pop up. They can&#039;t hide forever.

				Your &quot;Friends&quot; ripped you off, and now you want to get back at them?<br /><br />Are you sure it&#039;s your &quot;so-called friends&quot;, or maybe its your ex-girlfriend and the dude she was Fucking behind your back and in your bed.&nbsp; Then things ended real sour, and she called the cops on you?<br /><br />That makes alot more sense... lol<br /><br />Either way though, sorry the shit went down that way, but talkin shit about shipping product to peoples house just to get them busted it pure stupidity IMO.

				you could let karma handle it , like the more level headed above me have said, or hire someone like sniff sniff to help you hack their internet, suprising easy and cheap if the&#039;re using wifi. backtrack would probably surfice, then you could do all kinds of nefairous things to the thieving asshats.

				I don&#039;t get why they would first steal your stuff, and then report you to LE, are you sure you didn&#039;t leave anything out of your story? you did nothing to them in the first place? <br /><br />Anyways. if your can&#039;t successfully kill them all, and get away with it, what are your options? <br />No matter what you do wait a while, so they wont ever suspect you of doin anything. <br /><br />I would imagine that something would &quot;happen&quot; to this guys eventually just be patient.

				A friend of mine got burned by his best friend of thirteen years when he tried to middle man some bullshit deal for TWO FUCKING GRAMS of WAX. Weighed up as only 0.8, and when he asked him what&#039;s up, he knifed him and jacked his money (about $400). BEST FRIENDS??!!<br /><br />The money and wax? Just spilled milk...but that kind of betrayal? About two years down the line (people really hold grudges), though he was avoiding him like the plague, my friend thought of the perfect idea...Mind you, this guy started burning bridges left and right, so there&#039;s no way he would&#039;ve known. He was able to get an associate to attend some party his former best friend was at. 250mg of his best batch of 2c-B right into a drink of his.<br /><br />Sure, it was a little extreme... But after his break, he moved to an entirely different country.<br /><br />You&#039;re right karma is a bitch, and I probably wouldn&#039;t advocate something like this... But if they were good friends, that type of betrayal burns holes in your psyche; and fuck them for calling the cops. But keep thinking, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll discover something; nature will show you, and that&#039;s karma, boi.

				Send them love and sit back and watch what they did to you pile back upon themselves. Kinda like the ones above said about karma, but in my experience this formula of a sorts, works well, too reliably for me to ignore, send them pure legitamite love and forgive them for what they did to you, realize that humans that are underevolved end up fucking up sometimes and doing terrible things even though its something you would never do. Really, try it, saturate em in some pure forgiving love right from your heart and whatever hateful greedy thing they did to you will eventually, many times near instantly pile back upon themselves, when you do that, its like they are pissing in the wind, spitting at a fan, shooting at a bulletproof wall point blank and getting shot by there own bullet, the main thing is to be that brick wall of love. Thats how i believe karma works, if you try n fuck these people over and get revenge, you wont get nearly as far. Steady your emotions, take time to think before wanting to revenge assholes, usually i can calm down eventually, then i do what i recomended, just a tip that Ive found very effective in my experience~

				I have to agree with the Karma thing.. <br />I make a habit of trying not to screw people over in general .. but also because I believe in Karma..<br /><br />That sucks what happened.. but if those people are really like that, they will end up screwing themselves over.<br />

				don&#039;t even consider getting them busted - never ever snitch... where i come from nobody would even talk to you if they knew you&#039;d done that.<br /><br />wanting revenge sucks, it keeps you up all night long. it&#039;s a horrible emotion. i would advise you try not to think about the whole thing, eventually it will feel less raw. otherwise you&#039;re just going to get angrier and angrier and its real hard work.<br /><br />alternatively, if you do opt for revenge then it does need to be &#039;served cold&#039; - bide your time, no rash decisions, that&#039;s important. and you need to be very clever to do it properly. on occasion i have wished i was smart enough to think up some truly wicked n devious revenge plot that would work &amp; i wouldn&#039;t get caught but i don&#039;t have that type of brain. and generally once time has passed i&#039;ve forgotten all about it.<br /><br />i did see a vendor on bmr or atlantis or somewhere, offering to mail cat shit to your enemy along with the message of your choice. epic service, made me lol.

I wanted to get revenge on this guy for so long, I did everything for him, fronted him weed, money, whatever he needed. Hed ask to front weed to sell to support his family etc and we were good friends, always treated the guy with 101% respect, then one day he got busted with a measly qp 4 ozs, and he set me up, he knew that i was on probation for years, quit smoking weed, waiting patiently for it to end, and just when i was about to get off, bam, this asshole blasts me off into a whole new hell, thats what made this even worse. Like anything, I eventually worked through all of it, i still see the guy in the grocery store once in a while and get tempted to say something or beat the living shit outta him, he usually runs fast towards other isles at the site of me cause hes such a shameful piece of shit, but i never went thru with my revenge and im glad i didnt, it could have made things alot worse, and i feel better in the end completing this hell he helped put me in for a few years and to this day he cannot find a decent bag of weed anywhere around here, as soon as he meets new dealers they find out about him cause everyone knows i have papers proving what he did, his life sucks, he has to hide his face wherever he goes, because everyone knows hes a piece of shit that cant handle his own problems like a man and would do the same to anyone if he did to a friend like me. Anyway mighta sidetracked a little here getting angry about this guy, but my point is, i decided against the revenge and in the long run I have an awesome life now with one of the best reputations i know, and this guys life, well you heard the rest earlier... also something kinda funny i have to throw in there, him and his whole family are inbreds, he told me one night all drunk and i played along kinda like uhhh cool dude., i dont judge you, and i really didnt at the time, maybe giggled a little when i left, but told noone, but ya just thought that was funny, almost like he got prekarma lol~

				sometimes karma manifests itself into a persons fist, if you really really really want to get them in trouble, get a trashed box, rub weed all over it, and pour grease in it to stain the box, then put 1.0 grams in it along with a note saying &quot;i dont know why you need a gram of pot when you have 5 pounds at your house, whatever though, and send it from a random address, it will 100% for sure get flagged by the feds and they will get raided, also make the address handwritten and the weed poorly poorly wrapped, maybe 1 plastic bag.<br /><br /><br />use my revenge wisely young grasshoppa

				Like most before me have said don&#039;t get revenge.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s tempting and you want to lash out but in the end they should get what&#039;s coming to them.&nbsp; Just do right and forgive them as hard as that might be and then in the end you&#039;ll be better off.&nbsp;

				If someone or some people need to be dealt with, snitching isn&#039;t the way to go. Kind of an oxymoron, almost. This is a code. If you don&#039;t catch up to them, I can bet %100 karma will! Stay safe and be smart, my friend

				DONT DO IT! lol first your wasting more money right? Why ship away free money for LE to burn. Keep the weed. Personally id say handle it the old fashion way.. With a louieville slugger to their kneecaps... If your cant stomach handling your own, then just maybe your in the wrong line of business.

Because revenge is the primary law of nature.<br /><br />As for karma, another of those pseudo new-age rules that are just delusions. Do you really think that if you kill 100 worms you will get killed 300 times? C&#039;mon!<br /><br />To the OP: if you want revenge, mailing them drugs will not do it. Too many way outs, you have to come up with something better. Probably the faster way is to simply do it yourself.

What world do you live on people?<br /><br />Look around ffs. It is full of weaklings going on with this story of &quot;karma&quot; to defend their weakness and the only &quot;karma&quot; that ever do justice of them is the one in their imagination (and if they even knew they could actually use it for real instead than just wondering if &quot;karma&quot; will do it instead).<br /><br />Do you know why many people believe in &quot;karma&quot;? Because they observe nature and there naturally EVERY act has an effect. But this is *revenge* in human terms, NOT &quot;karma&quot; (in the sense of &quot;I do this action and a not well defined God/Law/Principle/Whatever will respond to that action for me&quot;, it doesn&#039;t work in this way in nature and not certainly between humans) . <br /><br />If you throw a rock into water, the rock will bring down the level of water on the point of contact and raise it outside to compensate. This is what it happens in nature. Every act has a &quot;revenge&quot;, i.e. an effect in return. In humanity is the same, in the sense that it depends on humans themselves to &quot;compensate&quot; for every act. You can do it by &quot;forgiveness&quot; or by &quot;revenge&quot;, but both must be coming from intention, not because you have no other choice and you shield yourself with some concept that has no place in nature. That&#039;s just weakness and not acting, letting go a cause without an effect, and either thinking you are doing something great.

You follow a code when the other has enough honor and dignity to do him/herself. When the other completely lacks those what kind of &quot;code&quot; do you have to adhere to? If one is a piece of shit it serves nothing to treat him with honor, it will actually just remove honor from yourself (you can research on these things in bushido or even knight valor conducts btw).<br /><br />It is just that in this case snitching will serve very little. Or the OP can study something when this will work (but it can be too much trouble than it&#039;s worth) or it&#039;s better to do it another way.

Real forgiveness comes when you are in the position of even utterly destroying the one that caused you harm but instead you let go for one of many reasons, being them coming from philosophy or compassion or whatever. If your &quot;forgiveness&quot; is just impotence is not forgiveness but simply what you must accept given your status and that you then turn into a sort of higher moral stature to still feel powerful inside that impotence.

Your &quot;forgiveness&quot; wasn&#039;t really a choice because you had no choice (or at last you have not come to the point of really having a choice; if you already did knew how to revenge yourself and then WILLINGLY decided to forgive them then it would have been real forgiveness, but now you are just one that has no way to do that, an impotent guy, and thinking you are &quot;forgiving&quot; just because of this).
