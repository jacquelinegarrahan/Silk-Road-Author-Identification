				Post by: <strong>Cyrax</strong> on <strong>July 16, 2013, 11:20 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I was always fascinated with the art of counterfeiting money. Not for the purpose of going and deceiving small business owners by giving them counterfeits and getting legitimate currency in return but doing it because of the challenge that comes with it. <br /><br />So I was thinking of why not starting with USD because it seems to be the easiest to counterfeit. Try and do the digital method instead of the bleaching $1 bills and printing $100 on top of them. <br /><br />What paper would be the most suited to give it that feel? I was researching and found that newsprint paper is probably the best way to start off with, print off the face and back of the bill on two separate sheets with the security features on one and then glue them together with a spray adhesive but all of that sounds like it would make the bill look sloppy and not feel right. <br /><br />Any of you know any better ways?<br /><br />This is all hypothetical and purely for research and development. I don&#039;t condone counterfeiting.

				Its easier than people think (you used to be able to find &#039;how-to&#039; videos on youtube, i remember watching them a few years back) but it also is getting harder and harder each year.<br />Look into &#039;Supernotes&#039; and personal trial and error is probably the best teacher. <br /><br />As for your moral stipulations regarding not defrauding individuals...just buy drugs with them.

				There are so many security features on a bill, especially with all of the new-age colored bills (and the new $100&#039;s coming out later this year).&nbsp; If you end up counterfeiting anything, just do $20&#039;s and use them somewhere you don&#039;t normally go to make a purchase that gives change back.

I hate the orange 100 on the backside, makes it look like monopoly money. And good point on the $20s but I wont be counterfeiting (decided not to even if I wasnt going to go and buy stuff wit the counterfeits) it takes too much time and effort and chances of getting busted after using a counterfeit are pretty big. not worth the risk at the end imo
