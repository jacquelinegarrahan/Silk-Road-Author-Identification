				i recieved my second parcel today a week apart from my first one. and like my first one there was a number written and circled on the express post enverlope. this was also the same number as the first parcel...this wasnt the seller because they are from two different sellers. could this just be a post office thing ..or something to worry about..i will also add i have recieved over 100 packages to me.(that were not drug related) and i cannot remember one time where there has been a number circled.

				About a month ago all my domestic packages started coming with a black line across the front and then something scribbled on the back. Always the same since then.<br />Its just a post office/aus post thing. I dont know why anyone would mark your packages with a number and them deliver it, with your order inside.&nbsp; The number would relate to some internal postoffice process.&nbsp; The average person receiving mail isn&#039;t going to be to concerned with a number written on their package so I think maybe expect things like that but dont let it get to you.. And they arrive yeah? my advice, don&#039;t look for problems, they almost never exist.&nbsp; Not a great help but it helps me accept it when shit goes down.

				Yeah I&#039;m hearing you, similar thing with my first international order, I dont think slept for a week.&nbsp; Every scenario possible going through my head that week.&nbsp; Never had any issue though.&nbsp; And now 18 orders and everyone arrived perfectly.&nbsp; Not directed at you but in general I think security is a must, and taking measures to keep yourself anonymous very important but I&#039;ve noticed a bit of unnecessary worrying about things easily explained.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m guilty of paranoia with my postie... I mean how many express packages and international per week is too many? .. 8, 10?..&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; hope not. When it comes down to it although we live in a country over policed, nannied, and general over governed... the penalties we face and receive are nothing in comparison to many other nations and I know the way my systems are set up and the way I use SR It would be extremely hard to prove any wrong doing on my part.&nbsp; I hope everyone is set up the same.<br /><br />
