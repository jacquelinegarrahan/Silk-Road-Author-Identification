				In order to warn all newbies.&nbsp; Because you wont respond to my messages.&nbsp; It&#039;s been 10 days &#039;in transit&#039; with ZERO communication.&nbsp; You communicated up until the point I placed an order, then went silent. <br />I will try to have a resolution in 12 hours. <br /><br />Please note: I am not trying to destroy your rep.&nbsp; You seem to be doing that by yourself, however.&nbsp; I only want to warn newcomers.<br /><br />This is ridiculous. <br /><br />I strongly advise against using this vendor.&nbsp; I am not the only one.&nbsp; Read his review thread.&nbsp; Lack of communication and delayed orders have been a consistent problem with this vendor.&nbsp; I ordered at a time when you seemed to be catching up on delays and people seemed happy.&nbsp; This is just bullshit.&nbsp; <br /><br />/rant<br /><br />

				Lots of pissed off people who recently purchased from him including myself but he still has good feedback...... Why?&nbsp; Someone who doesn&#039;t respond to emails especially when there is a problem is a 1 out of 5 automatically.&nbsp; That is why we have email so we can communicate.... I aint trying to be his penpal. I just want to know when and how I am to get my order that was shipped incomplete......

				I just placed an order with dieseltherapy and did his FE option to get an extra 20% free.&nbsp; but as soon as I FE&#039;d the product I ordered was taken off the list.&nbsp; So either I got some of the last stuff, or its possible I&#039;m getting screwed.&nbsp; Has anyone else had good experiences with DT out there? its been a couple weeks since the last posting on this forum and he seems to be catching up and getting a higher rating as a seller.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish i would have read this before placing an order.
