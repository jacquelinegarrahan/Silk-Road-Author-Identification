				Some sites don&#039;t give you a choice, but you can choose to pay a small fee (I think 0.01 BTC) to have a fast transaction, or not pay a fee and wait longer. I guess you are suffering from having done the latter, even if you didn&#039;t realise it. Or something went wrong.

I just made my first deposit recently and they mentioned to me that I used an archived address that could be deleted at any time, or something like that. Just request a new one each time and it should alleviate that issue.

				yeah you are absolutely rite it just totally slipped out ov my mind to use a new address this time, but the question is what to do now should i be waiting or what. the thing is i am going abroad in a weeks time thats why wanted to make my last purchase before leaving coz its gonna be a long trip. running out of time thats what worrying me, otherwise i would ve been totally fine with the delay.
