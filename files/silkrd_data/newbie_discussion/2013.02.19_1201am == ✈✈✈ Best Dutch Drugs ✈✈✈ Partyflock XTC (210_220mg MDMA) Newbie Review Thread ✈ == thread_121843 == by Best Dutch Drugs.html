				i found bdd just by searching thru and comparing all the xtc vendors. the last vendor i used was out of stock so i had to find a new one and looking at all of them and comparing: product, price, shipping/stealth policies and feedback i found bdd to be the best overall.<br />i ordered 10 partyflocks on monday, shipped on tuesday, delivered to ireland on thursday cant ask for more than that.<br />stealth was perfect, sealed in odor proof mylar bag which i thimk every vendor should use<br />price is among the best on sr considering shipping is included<br />product as described, none broken quality is excellent<br />communication was excellent<br />BDD from me you get a perfect 10!

				After searching the pills section for a good while i decided to go with bdd, what i don&#039;t regret at all. Decent prices, vendor page seems perfectly professional and so my purchase went. <br /><br />It was my very first purchase on SR and i couldn&#039;t be more satisfied - put in my order sunday night, marked in transit in monday, received it today. 1 broken pill out of 10 which is unlucky, but happens. obviously not bdd fault.<br /><br />package was nice and stealthy, just like an usual business letter, could have used some kind of return address to make it more serious is the only thing i might suggest - anyway, i&#039;m happy that i got a few of these bad boys and i&#039;ll be back for more definitely. <br /><br /><br />Great vendor&nbsp; 8)<br />

				BDD is one of my favourites one SR.. Always great with communication and the product speak for themselves... Can&#039;t wait to try the goods.. Stealth packaging is good, product arrived so I can&#039;t complain... I believe regardless of the packaging if it gets stopped I&#039;m sure the will find anyone&#039;s stuff... BDD obviously doesn&#039;t attract too much attention... Keep up the great work...

				I have to say that is the most impressive and comprehensive vendor page I have seen, congratulations! :) Right now I&#039;m out of bitcoins (it&#039;s really hard getting them in my country) but hopefully I&#039;ll be able to try one of your Partyflocks! :) Cheers!

				I think BDD is out of Party flocks... I&#039;ve heard they are substituting Mortal Kombats instead if the buyer agrees... Same Presser, different logo...

				Ordered 10 partyflocks a month ago. Was going to be offline for a while so (foolishly) FE&#039;d on the assumption that my pills would be there long before I would be back online.<br />After 3 weeks nothing arrived. PMed BDD saying I was worried. They replied suggesting I open resolution to extend for 10 days more. I told them they already had my money so resolution was not an option for me. Said I would wait the full month then get back in touch.<br />Nothing ever came. Had several other orders to the same mailbox before and since though. I got a refund of 50% of the dollar value of my order. I didn&#039;t pay dollars. The bitcoins that I did actually pay in increased in value around 300% in the meantime though. I got a refund of maybe 1/8th.<br /><br />I have to tip my hat to these guys. If I was selling on SR I could simply not ship say every 10th order from a new customer. I could use this 10% to subsidise my prices to ensure I still get plenty of business. Worst case scenario I hang on to some fool&#039;s money for a month, then give half of it back to him. Best case scenario, I keep the money for a month, during which time it increases in value 300%, then I give back a fraction of it and the &quot;customer&quot; is expected to be happy about getting a refund!<br />It&#039;s making a fortune on drug dealing without dealing any drugs.<br />I&#039;ll be taking my business back to Chemical Brothers or Alice in Holland and won&#039;t be swayed by a couple of cent price difference in future.

				Hey Mill,<br /><br />what about this for a hypothetical??<br /><br />What if bitcoins went down by 90% in that period.. would you be happy to get 10% of what you original paid in the 1st place due to the fluctuation in bitcoin value???<br /><br /><br />unfortunately that the way the cookie crumbles...<br /><br />You win some, you lose...<br /><br />Seriously though.. 10 pills?? $100 approx... I think it would be hardly worth it..<br /><br />WI

				I think an accusation of selective scamming is really not something you want to toss around lightly. You didn&#039;t say where you lived, and your mail was left alone for weeks - we don&#039;t know the circumstances. Maybe the mailman nicked it, maybe a neighbor or a friend (if possible), or maybe customs snagged it and didn&#039;t send you a letter, or it got snagged on the Dutch side. <br /><br />I placed my very first order on SR with BDD and was very satisfied. Pills (10x Mortal Kombat) arrived in less time than I expected to the USA. Got about 9-9.25 pills out of 10, lost some to the mail.<br /><br />The innermost packaging had ruptured unfortunately, but the true stealth package was untouched and opaque. Could not feel the contents of the envelope. Haven&#039;t taken the pills yet but nobody&#039;s ever questioned the quality from BDD as far as I know - Partyflocks/MKs are known as great pills.<br /><br />Will definitely consider ordering again from them, though may try a few other vendors just to shop around. Overall i was very very satisfied &amp; it gave me confidence in using SR.

Or should Amazon be allowed refund me based on an arbitrarily selected currency which benefits them the most?<br />Do you suppose that dollars are the most convenient currency for a business (presumably) based in Holland? I have been to Holland and there weren&#039;t too many businesses displaying price lists in dollars.<br /><br />To answer your question, I could have no possible argument about the vendor if the refund had been given as exactly half of the amount I had paid in the currency I had paid.<br /><br />There is absolutely no point in having these fora if they are going to be populated by &quot;OMFG I can&nbsp; buy drugs on teh internetz&quot; yanks thinking they can curry favour with drug dealers by defending them here. The escrow system is a safety net of sorts but if you think that it is weighted in favour of the buyer you are deluded.
