				This is a brief synopsis of my personal SR experience with deliveries. <br /><br />FiberOptic-&nbsp; 5/5 Product 4FA: Seller uses good communication, has very good product and even sends MSDS with delivery. This was one of the most pleasant experiences on SR for me. Quick, stealthy delivery too. I highly recommend this seller.<br /><br />Coinage- 5/5 Product BTC: Good communication, quick , fair. I recommend him.<br /><br />chembros- 0/5 Product V: Poor communication, letter came with rips and stuck together pages and none of what I ordered. I wrote and asked about it and was treated as if I were a begger on the streets. I do not know if this guy is a selective scammer of just inept, but I highly recommend that you go elsewhere. If you just want to throw money away, try the toilet...at least it has a chance of re-surfacing there!!!<br /><br />Holland Online- 3/5 Product X: Good communication, nice guys, never got my product and got 10% refund. I recommend US sellers for US buyers, even if it is more.<br /><br />10Toes- 5/5 Product Coke: Great guy, definitely here to do business. There was an issue with product and he cleared it right up...upfront and honest. Stealth, product and speed all good. Do business with him if you want coke.<br /><br />Hammertime- 5/5 Product Meth: Quick, stealth, BADASS meth....too much for me actually...got really tweaked and weird....so that is a positive actually. I say use this guy, but pace yourself!!!!<br /><br />Purple Lotus- Product Coupons: 10/5 Good guy, good product, do business with him.<br /><br />Righteous- 5/5- Porduct NBOME: Quick, stealth good all around strong product!! USE HIM

				I have also had some issues with getting product from Holland in the USA.&nbsp; Although one of the times it was a honest mistake from the vendor where some people got two orders and some got none.&nbsp; A successful vendor is probably getting 100&#039;s of orders, but I got a 100% refund so it was no problem. The second time I think the vendor was just a scammer, he required finalize early in all cases and as&nbsp; a new user of SR I wanted to establish a good reputation. <br /><br />Trouble is allot of what you want in Holland it not available in America so I look for vendors who are ok with escrow.&nbsp; I have been successful a few times.

				You are welcome to all who thanked me, this is the kind of stuff I would like to see more of as it aids new buyers. Most vendors want to see a minimum of transactions, a good way to build you number is to buy digital goods and lottery. They usually do not require minimum transactions, that is what I did anyway. Look at the sellers numbers, most of the digital goods and lottery are up near 100, so you are pretty safe there. Look out for viruses when purchasing digital goods, use a san box, look it up if you do not know what one is!!<br /><br />I have another to add to add to my experiences:<br /><br />Natural Weed 3/5 Product &quot;Dutch Speed&quot;- The guy is nice and I want to believe that he is honest. My product never came however and I got nothing but an apology in return. I do not 0/5 the guy because I want to believe, but the product never came either way.<br /><br />I have one other order from EU on the way and if that does not come, I am through. With their rigid return policy it would be too easy to sucker US buyers into a scam to be honest. If you agree to some policy that only gives you 10% or nothing back, you are honor bound to give the 5/5 feedback if they abide by it. It is too easy to think that a guy can sit back and wait a month for a 90-100% return on the money and have the SR policy that you agreed to backing him up. And if you complain? Well you are a new buyer and they are an established SR seller...<br /><br />Not saying that is always the case, just that the opportunity is there and could be taken by people who are prone to easy money.<br /><br />Like I said, one more and I am through. This (if it does not come through) will make EU 0/3 in delivering. I never order much, so it is better to learn from mistakes than to have the mark of a scammer or refund on your stats. There are very honest sellers out there, I have named a few on this thread.<br />
