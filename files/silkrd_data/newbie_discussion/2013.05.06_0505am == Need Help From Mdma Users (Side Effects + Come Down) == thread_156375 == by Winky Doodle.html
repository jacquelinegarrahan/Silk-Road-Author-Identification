				I wrote a bunch of stuff but decided to delete it because it was a lot to read. Basically, I researched for days while my mdma was in the mail about doses, experiences, etc. I did like 1-2 hours of research before I took it, and I didn&#039;t read once about anybody saying not to re-dose or anything. I knew the doses to take, but after researching for hours I thought it was just like any other drug, and you got a regular hangover from it, if any. Nobody mentioned not to re-dose and the after-effects, in like 20+ articles and different sites I looked through.<br /><br /><br />I ended up re-dosing 2-3 times and at the end of 3-4 days I had consumed 800mg mdma.<br />I woke up the next day and my head just felt weird, and it was all in my head not my body or anything. Like I don&#039;t know how to explain it really, it was bad. I ended up going to the hospital but they didn&#039;t know fuck all about mdma, they did a blood and urine test, and didn&#039;t give me any information or anything.<br /><br /><br /><br />What I want to know is the after-effects you usually get after taking mdma. Like the exact feels because I don&#039;t know if what I&#039;m getting is regular or it&#039;s unique and need to get checked out or something. It&#039;s been around 3 days now since I&#039;ve taken the last dose. What I have right now is all in my head, my body feels fine. It&#039;s like a burning sensation, and a pressure feeling around the back and side of my head. I have really bad anxiety 24/7 and I can&#039;t get to sleep. The burning feeling is also kind of in the front of my head. I just feel like emptiness and lonliness, I don&#039;t know how to explain it.<br /><br />Is this normal? Please tell me the effects you have when coming down from a large dose of MDMA, or a small dose if you had a bad come down.

				never heard of this happening before. <br />you had 800mg in the course of 3-4 days? <br />fuck...i have had a whole gram to myself in one single night. woke up just feeling a little depressed, that is all that happened to me. only went on for about 2 or 3 days. taking 2-3 5-htp pills during the day helped also. i would go out and buy some 5-htp from walmart or rite aid or somewhere like that. take about 2-3 of them in the course of a day for a few days and see what happens then,

				I still am not sure if you are for real or what. I&#039;m not sure you have read a word of advice that has been given; take your 5HT and B vitamins and calm the heck down. <br /><br />Everyone has different brain chemistry, some people produce tons of serotonin and dopamine normally, some do not. The effects someone might feel with 800mg could be equal to what 2 grams is for another person. One problem is adding doses stacked on each other can be very bad. MDMA affects the bodies ability to metabolize drugs, including further doses of MDMA while already taking MDMA therefore it can quickly compound the amount in the bloodstream.<br />Research serotonin, doapmine and norepinephrine; those are the three things affected in the brain by mdma. Side effects can last for up to a week as your brain chemistry regulates. If you truly took a dose that was too much for you to handle then you are likely to experience depression, restlessness, iirritability, insomnia, anxiety, and a host of other things. It&#039;s even possible that you have permanently damaged some neurons. <br /><br />

They usually last 48+ hours. The part I feel that I haven&#039;t seen anywhere is just the hot burning feeling on the back of my head and my face.<br /><br /><br />@Jack N Hoff yeah I have read of people doing that, but is it worse to take it over and over again over a few days? That&#039;s what I did, I kept the same dose amount of 200MG, and I did it 4 times. The last dose of 200MG is when I started to feel like this, when I woke up.<br /><br /><br />@silver Yeah it&#039;s been 3 days I probably need to give it more time, I&#039;m just sketched out. I was rolling for 4 days or so.

				MDMA is not without side effects and as someone else said, everyone is different and you might just be more sensitive to it. Pressure in the head and a down mood is pretty normal IME. MDMA fucks with blood pressure and I&#039;ve personally gotten super light-headed when I stand up from a horizontal or seated position -- occasionally to the point where I&#039;ve fainted a couple of times. Drink lots of water to offset the dehydration, which doesn&#039;t help the funny feeling in your head. And even though you&#039;re not really going to be hungry while rolling, avoid skipping meals like I did yesterday because the low blood-sugar next morning just makes everything worse. These side effects should be relatively short-lived...most go away within 24-48 hours for me. Usually the worst and longest-lasting side effects for me is sore jaw for a few days from all of the clenching (and sometimes I gnaw on my cheeks, so they get sore and irritated too).<br /><br />5-HTP (you can get it from GNC) is said to help the following week, although I still feel pretty unmotivated and irritable for a few days even with it. <br /><br />You&#039;ll be fine. Just lay off the molly for a few weeks. :)

I was clean besides a couple Oxycodone and 1 gram of shrooms for about a year, and I took both of those things about a month and a half before I rolled. So I took 8 Vicodin and 8 100mg Green Bulls over 3-4 days, and I can&#039;t stop panicking that it will be permanent.<br /><br />

				You&#039;ll be fine. Give it a week and you should be back to 100% normal. Eat healthy, get plenty of sleep, and be sober until then to speed up the process.

				I&#039;m coming down now. Just got a horrible fucking head ache.<br /><br />Someone line me up another dose.....<br /><br />@allthings if you didn&#039;t read this is what this thread was fucking about. you might get away with it once or twice but you&#039;re going to end up having a mother fucker of a comedown. The bad thing is you don&#039;t know how long it&#039;s going to last. Some people say it lasts 1+ months, and others say up to a week.<br /><br />I was eating a shit ton of vitamins, drinking OJ, probably drank 10+ gallons of water. I was going to the bathroom every 10 or 15 minutes sometimes, and sometimes less. Drink tea too, and eat eggs, whole wheat bread, and nutrition bars along with some Apples or some fruits.<br /><br />Also, if you want to go to sleep. No matter how bad you feel take a shower it will calm you down.<br /><br /><br />My comedown was so fucking horrible, I was flipping out. I couldn&#039;t have the TV turned off, but I couldn&#039;t have it turned on. I had to have it on the right channel or I would start getting anxiety like fuck, and even if it was on that channel I still got fucking anxiety. Same with the computer too. When I tried to go to sleep all I could think of was not going to sleep, and then I would get anxious and paranoid as fuck and get up and have to turn the TV and computer on again, and the same thing still happened w/ the channel thing. I kept leaving my house to go on a walk because that was literally the only thing that would calm me down, but I was still sketching out.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t like regular anxiety or depression or whatever either. You know how you drop off a roller coaster, or the feeling you get when you&#039;re doing something illegal and a cop pulls around? I had those feelings except&nbsp; 3x worse, for 3+ days 24/7.<br /><br /><br />I still got a bad fucking headache too...<br /><br /><br />IMO not worth the high, definitely not. I would take max 100-200MG every month, and that&#039;s it. And even at that it&#039;s not worth the risk of doing every month, it fucks with your brain chemicals, it&#039;s way to fucking dangerous to just be taking 100MG&#039;s of it every couple days now and then. There&#039;s tons of other drugs that I would rather do than Mdma to be honest, Mdma is definitely a once in a blue moon type of thing.<br /><br /><br />I also popped 8 Vicodin w/ the 800MG Mdma

				My really bad experiences with MDMA comedown have pretty much all been related to not recharging properly after taking, ie. drinking, eating and sleeping. Don&#039;t drink too much, though, as that is not healthy either. 10 gallons over 2 days or whatever seems wayy excessive.

				The lady swears by Xanax as a great way to reduce come-down anxiety (and to get to sleep after a long night). Weird thing is, this most recent time I was fine the night of (probably because I smoked some weed), but the next night I had the worst anxiety ever and had to take half a pill in order to get to sleep.<br /><br />But yeah, I don&#039;t get people who use this shit every week. It&#039;s fun and amazing and all, but it&#039;s pretty rough on your body (especially the older you get).

				Hello, Mr.!<br /><br />I had the same thing as you one of the first times I took it. It happens when you redose/use for days in a row. I got depression-like symptoms; almost as if I was empty, got sleep-paralyses, disturbed sleeping patterns, loss of appetite etc. Nobody could answer why I felt this way, but I eventually found out myself: you should dose ONLY ONCE and you should wait AT LEAST 2 weeks between every session; you have to sleep a lot (in a dark room, because light &quot;lightens&quot; the production of serotonin) and eat vitamins.<br /><br />A few tips that worked for me:<br />1) Pop vitamins before going to sleep the same day you&#039;ve tripped.<br />2) Sleep much.<br />3) Eat healthy food.<br />4) Take a shower after you&#039;re finished tripping.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Good luck<br /><br />~Best regards

				I usually only roll at concerts which means I don&#039;t do it that often. I usually take vitamins before and after and smoke weed after the effects have worn off that night. Usually helps me eat something before I sleep, helps me sleep, and reduces anxiety.

				Fuck me, 800mg in one sitting WOW.<br /><br />You&#039;ve just burned through about 500mg of your stash for nothing. <br /><br />I recommend - 1 large dose 200mg tops then a redose of no more than 50mg after 1.5 hours, then don&#039;t take any more. It&#039;s not doing anything for you, take some speed or coke if you must after your redose. This is why:<br /><br />1) Redosing when your brain is low on Serotonin will cause dopamine to damage your reuptake pumps. This causes irreversible damage to your CNS.<br />2) After your 1st redose you have minimal serotonin left in your brain. Continually redosing will only cause an increase in dopamine in your CNS because their is no serotonin left to release into the synapse. That&#039;s why you feel speedy but don&#039;t get the MDMA feelings after redosing a few times.<br /><br />All your side effects are normal for a massive night!!!<br /><br />Cheers Adz<br />

				Alright so I woke up feeling pretty refreshed and I thought everything was gone. When I awoke I had this bad feeling like I was about to have a huge panic attack, but prevented it by popping the window open and drinking a bottle of water, I was fine from then on. About 4-5 hours later after I woke up, when someone had gotten home, I started getting a bit of anxiety, and then turned into a full fledged anxiety attack for 4-5 hours. This is really freaking me out, because I will come down and then out of nowhere I&#039;ll be hit with this anxiety and depression, making me feel anxious, hopeless, and that the world isn&#039;t even real, like questioning how I am here and how the first thing was made, and then whoever made that thing, had to be made by something else. This is all I can think of when these happen.<br /><br /><br />Out of nowhere I will get a little rise in my mood, and feel like I can be normal or just talk. Then almost immediately after I get it it will go away. This happened quite frequently after the initial come down, which was pure hell. Then eventually it subsided and I feel normal, besides this MAJOR ringing in my ears. It won&#039;t go away and I can&#039;t fall asleep, either because of the ringing or the anxiety/anxiousness.<br /><br />Right now I just calmed down from the 4-5 hour panic attack that started around 3-4 hours after I woke up. I feel the same as I did when I came down from the intense depression/anxiety (this is still really intense, probably one of the worst experiences in my life) but it&#039;s just the next day. I&#039;m afraid to fall asleep because of the effects, and how they will probably just keep coming back when I wake up.<br /><br /><br />I came to a conclusion about what might of happened with the pressure in my head and the burning. I am going to summarize it up because I just wrote out a long explanation but I know nobody will feel like reading it. Something from the amount of Mdma I took made my brain swell up (burning sensation, pressure, and headache) causing brain damage, because I also read these are the same symptoms people have when they get a concussion, which also cause brain damage. Something called Tintinnus is caused by a similar problem, which is damaging in the neurological parts of your brain, and I think that may be what happened. What could of also happened is that it&#039;s just a regular side effect, because it looks like it&#039;s also common for many drugs (even Aspirin) to cause the ringing in the ears. I don&#039;t know how long it will last, but I&#039;m fairly sure it will go away, I&#039;m not to bothered by it because I&#039;m mostly focused on the anxiety/depression , and I&#039;m just glad I&#039;m not feeling that (as much) right now. I still am unable to go to sleep though, I&#039;ll give it another try.<br /><br /><br />I still have that burning/pressure/headache feeling in my head, except it&#039;s mainly just on the side on my head now, and&nbsp; little bit on the back. I think this may also be what&#039;s causing the Tinnitus. If there is anyone who felt the pressure and burning around your head if you could tell me how long it lasted I would really appreciate it, because I looked it up and it seems quite a few other people also got the headaches and pressure after dosing.

				I&#039;ve eaten grams of molly at a time. I couldn&#039;t see because me eyes were bouncing so fast. Anyway, with good molly, even at dosing a full gram, I never get an uncomfortable comedown. I&#039;m still fucked up a little and just go to sleep. The next day depends on a lot. If you use lots of drugs that effect your serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc, you won&#039;t feel too happy. If you use stimulants like Adderall regularly, take a break and supplement with L-Tyrosine to get your dopamine in check. No matter what, after rolling you are going to be somewhat serotonin deficient, so don&#039;t be dopamine, ep, and noep deficient too. I&#039;ve also heard wonders about 5HTP as a serotonin precursor to be used the day after. I&#039;d advise to not preload with the chemical though, you might experience exitotoxicity and/or neurotoxicity from a flood of serotonin.<br /><br />Shit, at festivals when I&#039;d eat a gram, a good nights rest and a few beers for breakfast did me fine. Psychedelics the next day will help as well, especially anything that disassociates you from your body. If you aren&#039;t there to feel the hangover, there isn&#039;t one (if you know what I mean).

				Sorry for multiple posts, but I just read most of your earlier posts. The back of the head and neck tension sounds like hypertension. I once ingested 1.5g of bkMDMA over the course of a night and hard similar effects. I was sold &quot;molly&quot; from a &quot;trustworthy&quot; source. I trusted this person so much that I didn&#039;t test the substance. Anyway, I kept redosing because I never got that &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; feeling like with MDMA. If I remember correctly, .5 grams of bk is toxic. I had an 8 hour come down that felt like pure terror, I think I hard a heart attack. I had chest pains and issues with pressure in my head for a few days after. I&#039;m fine now.<br /><br />Turns out that my friend has apparently never hard real MDMA. He thought the bk was the real deal. If you are not 100%, also send me your description of exactly how it felt - did you feel completely at peace with everything in the world and want to hug everyone? Did you have uncontrollable ecstatic sighs? Meaning just going Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. After the roll did you have a 3-8 hour comedown that felt like meth and demon-possessed LSD?<br /><br />Please let me know, I think we can help ya :) Just try not to worry. If you have access to benzos, take them! Ha

				If u r not used to stims the problem might be that u didnt learn to handle the body tension... beginners look after 200mg like they re constantly under an electric flow or sth... if i pop 300mgs I can sit and relax without any probs... did u drink enough? with doses above 150 mgs u always end up beeing dehydrated no matter how much u drink... u actually shouldnt even try to get to a hydrated state if u consume uncommon amounts of mdma... u would simply drain out all the minerals of your body and the hangover would be even worse... if u dont actually party u should drink 0,3L of WATER! per hour if dancing or sth 0,5L...

				MDMA is a pretty safe drug. What I more worry about from having too much is ruining the experience. Too much too often and before you know it no matter how much you have you can&#039;t get that feeling of euphoria anymore. As for your head yeah it can take a few days before you feel 100% again but after the first day coming down I can usually ignore any symptoms I may feel in the next few days. I&#039;d say you are being a bit paranoid being new to it and thinking about it too much. Doubt there could be any permanent damage from one big roll unless you were nearing the LD for MDMA which I believe to be a fair few grams of it. A ridiculous amount that no one would ever have just by redosing. You would have to have it all at once before the effects kicked in or you would be too out of it to have any more after the first few points.

				WOW YOU ARE A NOOB?<br /><br />You should of done that 1g in 10 doses. to do mdma for 3-4 days is not a big deal im not sure why you are suprised u feel like shit...of course you do, you did mdma for 3-4 days (ive done it for 7 once :) ) <br /><br />Allow me to educate you<br />-Mdma tells your brain to pump out lots and lots of serotonin<br />-serotonin is neurotransmitter, and is present in lots of parts of the brain including where yo emotions be at! it control mood! mdma made u feel good no!!!!!?<br />-your brain only has so much serotonin, and can only make so much, but mdma for 3-4 days (probably more - halflife) is telling ur brain to release lots and lots<br />-your brain runs out of serotonin - mdma stops working, and you are now wasteing it...<br />-you have no more mdma<br />-your brain needs serotonin to regulate your mood, and lots of other stuff<br />-no more serotonin left in ur brain<br />-ur brain needs time to make more serotonin and regain control of its output<br />-during this time u feel like shit <br /><br />so now the best thing to do is sleep and eat, time is key. do not use extacy or mdma for a little while or u will waste it<br /><br />and your brain shall recover and u can roll again! <br />NO BIG DEAL BROO<br />&nbsp;:o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o :o<br /><br /><br />oH AND I ALMOST FORGOT - BUY SOME SEROquel ... best thing for ANY comedown - it has a way of resetting harmones or something ;)

				Definitely a different kind of hangover from alcohol. Now that I have experienced it a few times the day after a big roll can feel kinda good. Just really slack, no appetite and maybe hard to stay in a good mood unless I have plenty of good memories from the night before to look back on. The first few times I rolled the comedown was pretty shocking. Felt like shit, couldn&#039;t be happy about anything and really worried if I&#039;d done any permanent damage to my health. To some up what cokewave just said, what ever good feelings Molly gives you one night she will try take from from you the next morning.

And you sounded like an idiot. If there&#039;s an issue with serotonin it&#039;s most likely because of a down-regulation of receptors. Seroquel for the come down because of blah blah resetting hormones? I&#039;m not going to even Google that, it sounds idiotic. If there&#039;s anything to take after MDMA, it&#039;s L-Tyrosine (or L-Tryptophan if you need help sleeping) because it&#039;s a dopamine precursor, as well as 5HTP, as it helps in the synthesis of serotonin. All three of the stated chemicals are amino acids and safe to take. Why would you tell someone to take an anti-psychotic for an MDMA comedown? Even if it reduces dopamine and serotonin uptake, it&#039;s pretty obvious the fella used all of those chemicals up when rolling.<br /><br />I can see using it (though I&#039;m not sure of safety - input from someone who knows would be nice) for saving your last bits of dopamine and serotonin at the end of a low dose roll (it will bind to the dopamine and serotonin receptors, perhaps blocking re-uptake..?), but it could possibly cause adverse effects. MDMA is acting as a serotonin agonist (telling your brain to not just release serotonin but to re-uptake it!) while Seroquel is telling the brain not to while binding to receptors. It seems it could cause neurotransmitter down-regulation since dopamine and serotonin need to be replentished, but with Seroquel bound to receptors, recover doesn&#039;t (in my opinion - I&#039;m no doc) seem like it would be achievable as quickly. With seroquel bound to receptors, they would naturally down-regulate as dopamine and/or serotonin wouldn&#039;t be able to do their thing.<br /><br />Anyway just drunken rambling, sorry. It just bugged me that kid called someone a noob with one post. Yes, I&#039;m a noob, but have some respect for other human beings! If it was his first experience with MDMA, he has all the reason so be asking questions as a result of negative health issues. Who else is he going to ask? I&#039;d think this would be the place...

				this thread alomost says everything there is to know about mdma but still i got some stuff to add:<br /><br />mdma in your body breaks down to mda so if you redose and dont get your first spike again another redose of it wont get you there either. this is one of the reasons why your high changes during the party<br /><br />there are scientific papers where they found out (at least in rats and monkeys) that if you ingest antioxidants(vitamins a c e and stuff) before the mdma you cancel out the neurotoxicity.<br />also if you smoke weed (consume thc) (it also works with a few synth cannabinoids) your body temperature will rise much less which is also good for the brain.<br /><br />i actually enjoy the comedown most of the time. it kind of feels like when i was a kid and the weather was shitty so i couldnt play outside with my friends and instead watched some cartoons on vhs.<br />also i personally wouldnt take serotonin precursors. i just eat a hand of nuts and a jumbo cup of fruitsalad so my brain has to work for what it wants

				Thanks for the info guys, some really good stuff in here I&#039;m going to keep in mind if I ever need to pass the info across or take it again (doubtful) . I&#039;m hoping I won&#039;t get into that bad anxiety/depression feeling again as I&#039;m feeling semi-okay right now, just a little foggy headed with the Tittinus, and some bad sleep deprivation. I&#039;ve been taking loads of Vitamins ever since the day I woke up in the come down, so I hope that will help with the neurotoxicity. I&#039;m almost certain the headache/burning/pressure thing was my brain swelling up. I could be wrong though. I took some frozen fruit out of my freezer and used them as ice packs on my head for about 20-30 mins, even though it was a little to late if there was anything I could of done, but it still helped. I&#039;m going to try and relax and I&#039;ll be checking in every now and then because I literally have nothing else to do right now. Hopefully the last of it will wear off here pretty soon.

				A lot of stuff has already been said but here are a couple of other things I used to do when the comedown was chronic.<br /><br />1) try not to panic. This comes with a bit of experience but panic makes things worse. You are going to feel rotten for a few days then things will return to normal. What you have/are experiencing is not that uncommon.<br /><br />2) replenish your body. after a long session your body will be depleted on nearly all levels. Salt, Sugar, vitamins etc. Don&#039;t overdo these either. You can get a lot of what you need from fruit, fat and protein. Make it a pleasure, have a nice, warm, chocolate milk before bed and some good fried food.<br /><br />3) if you start spiraling out, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself it&#039;s just a comedown. Try to take your mind off it with something else (I&#039;ve been bed ridden due to shit mdma with all manner of pain. Lounging in bed with back to back tv/movies and a constant stream of tea kind of helps. Also napping)<br /><br />4) if the serious symptoms last more that a few days and/or are not bearable consider visiting the hospital. Unless you are in serious medical distress and just appear anxious they may take pity on you and give you a short course of benzos. I&#039;m really not a doctor and this is just my experience but I have rarely dropped anything without knowing I&#039;ve got access to diazepam/alprazolam. Short of going blind, deaf or immobile a little bit of mothers helper is just the ticket. <br /><br />5) it&#039;s been said, but I will say it again with experience. Do not drop again too soon. leave it a month at least, probably more. I seriously hurt myself with overuse (a looooong time ago) and am now on SSRI&#039;s for life. It took years to regain some normalcy. Of course everyone is different but - Be warned and above all, be safe. Aint no high worth permanently frying your noodle for. I wish I had better access to information back then....

				Sounds to me like you learned a hard lesson.<br />Next time, don&#039;t spank it all in one go. The less often you use mdma, the better it will be.<br /><br />Most people find that benzos help with a come down. <br /><br />Personally I prefer an otc sleeper like diphenmydramine hcl - not everyone would agree with this though. <br /><br />Good advice in the thread though. Get plenty of sleep, eat well, relax. <br /><br />It&#039;s your first mdma experience though, hopefully this bad experience hasn&#039;t put you off mdma for good.

				dxm at the end of the roll can be neuroprotective its a nmda antagonist so it will slow brain activity toward the end and promote ngf upregulation

				It&#039;s been around 3 days since I&#039;ve recovered from the initial come down where I couldn&#039;t sit still, lay down, or even see clearly, and I still feel the same. Just really sad, and I am getting bad panic attacks throughout the day. My foot was inured awhile ago and I was really into sports, and I keep wanting to go workout and then remembering my foot will just hurt really bad after I&#039;m done running. I think I&#039;m going to go lift every day and do the bike or elyptical. This is pure hell, I really hope I don&#039;t stay like this. I mean, it was only a couple doses and I hadn&#039;t touched drugs or anything before that for at least half a year (besides a few pain-killers).<br /><br />I do have some Xanax I ordered, before I even knew about all this, that were in the mail still when I received the Mdma. I&#039;m wondering if I should just throw them away, or take one, because I swore I wouldn&#039;t do anymore drugs because it would just make it worse, but this is really getting to me. I just can&#039;t enjoy anything, and I can tell it&#039;s from the Mdma because I can feel it in my head. Ugh, I just want it to end, and I&#039;m only hoping it&#039;s not one of those &quot;long term&quot; come downs.

				Winky, if you&#039;re having serious panic attacks, don&#039;t throw the Xanax away. I&#039;m diagnosed with chronic anxiety from depersonalization. I don&#039;t get fucked up on my Xanax, it helps me function without going into horrific panic attacks. If you are experiencing debilitating panic attacks and decide to go to the hospital, they will put you on a medium/high length half life benzo. Xanax has a short/medium length half life, but in my experience, it works much better for instant relief. If you go to see a psychiatrist, they will probably put you on lorazepam or diazepam as they last longer than Xanax, though they aren&#039;t as &quot;strong&quot; for lack of better words. I highly doubt a benzo is going to do any damage to you though.<br /><br />What you&#039;re describing sounds more like bkMDMA than MDMA. The effects of the roll are indistinguishable if it&#039;s your first time. I overdosed on it because I never got the &quot;aaaahhh&quot; feeling and kept dosing, thinking it was simply cut to hell with some harmless chemical.<br /><br />If you read into water intoxication, which sounds very likely as you drank so much water, some of the effects are brain swelling etc. I had a concussion a year or two ago, and the brain swelling took quite a while to subside.<br /><br />At any rate, if you have insurance, by all means go to a doctor or hospital! You&#039;ll most likely be referred to a neurologist (be forewarned, those guys seem really full of themselves IME). If you&#039;ve done harm to your brain, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s reversible as you didn&#039;t do THAT much MDMA and you haven&#039;t chronically abused it. And as for your depression, go to Vitamin Shoppe and get some 5HTP for serotonin and L-Tyrosine for dopamine. They will honestly boost your happiness closer to normal! I&#039;m seriously speaking from experience with the L-Tyrosine, having no dopamine or down-regulated receptors is not fun, I&#039;ve been suicidal at times from being dopamine deficient. You&#039;re not alone buddy :)
