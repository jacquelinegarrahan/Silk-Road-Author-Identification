				I absolutely agree with you about bud. However, nothing beats some hash or oil sprinkled on some tasty nugs.

				Resin is gross,&nbsp; &nbsp;to me resin is what true broke pot heads smoke to get high when they have smoked up all the weed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It always gives me a headache, and I have generally always thrown that junk away.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never had oil or wax or hash.&nbsp; &nbsp; In my area it&#039;s kind of an oddity.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I had some hash I wouldn&#039;t even know how to smoke it properly tbh.

				I thought hash keif and resin were the same thing. Keif being loose resin and hash being pressed. Given the choice I&#039;d always smoke hash/keif but my grinder makes it so darn slow to get a bowl topper.

				living in the proper area to acquire foliage legally (whatever your definition of legal is), I have come to find, that nothing beats flower. Oils, waxes, and hash typically lose a lot of the desirable effects that indicas have. Indicas are typically more dreamy and slow, while sativas are more fast and cerebral. I have also been overly sensitive to sativas, either way (Ive smoked indicas daily for a year and a half) due to the paranoia I get when I move to sativa dominant strains.<br />Now, the point of all of this, is that cannabis is a complicated plant, there is a lot more chems (good chems) in bud than THC, like CBDs (cannabinoid delta)[1]. I&#039;m not too learned on the subject, but what I do know is that:<br /><br />Oils and waxes lack a lot of CBDs and other chemicals that make indica unique, but are really high in THC levels.<br /><br />To me the high I achieve puts oils and waxes into an extension of the sativa family, hash would be in an extension of a &#039;hybrid&#039; class of flowers...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107548.msg766559#msg766559">Quote from: SeekerOfTheDank on January 27, 2013, 04:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107548.msg737882#msg737882">Quote from: John F Kennedy on January 18, 2013, 04:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I thought hash keif and resin were the same thing.

				keif/kif = loose trichomes knocked or sifted from dried weed<br />Hash = pressed trichomes<br />hash oil = oil extracted from weed using a solvent of some sort<br /><br />These are terms that are hundreds of years old, and hash and keif could actually be over a thousand.<br /><br />Now we have modern extractions that people call this and that.&nbsp; Back in the 80&#039;s, 90&#039;s, 2000&#039;s resin was known as the black shit at the bottom of your pipe.&nbsp; Pipe resin.&nbsp; Uuuuugh.&nbsp; Now any oil that is concentrated enough to be solid matter is called resin, budder, concentrate, etc.<br /><br />BHO = butane honey oil<br />HO = honey oil (sometimes used interchangeably with BHO, straight honey oil can be achieved through extraction and filtering without using butane)<br /><br />Feel free to add any if you know what you&#039;re talking about.

				Hash is the way to go hands down, although topping a bowl of weed with it is the best way. And once you smoke it till the end you will have resin.
