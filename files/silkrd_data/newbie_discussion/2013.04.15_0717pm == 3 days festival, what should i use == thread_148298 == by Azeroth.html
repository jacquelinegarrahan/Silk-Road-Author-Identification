				I&#039;ve only been through E (allegedly, since no kit test) and LSD. Say i&#039;ma hit a long festival, and considering i shouldn&#039;t roll consecutive days, what else should i choise to increase my experience?

				are you planning on going to bed or staying up? and also &#039;rolling&#039; on consecutive days is probably a must at a festival. it is a festival after all.

				i like to plan rolling around my favorite artists but generally it is ok to do something like Fri &amp; Sun rolling with a break from that on Sat. as long as you dont do this all the time.&nbsp; mushrooms are a good one, don&#039;t take a lot if this will be your first time with those in a public/crazy setting.&nbsp; ive never done lsd at a festival but many people love it.&nbsp; I would probably have a chilled out day with some opiates, warm &amp; buzzy feeling is great with music.&nbsp; i&#039;ve also used methylone a day after mdma which is not nearly as good but still nice...maybe do methylone first and mdma next day. <br /><br />have fun!

				LSD is my favorite for festivals. It works well for having a couple trips throughout the festival i.e. Friday and Sunday. I took double the amount for the second day and it&#039;s just as enjoyable as the first day (I actually have enjoyed the second trip more. Even taking double the amount, the trip is less intense; very mellow and background, a manageable, feel-good effect).

				can&#039;t think of anything to bring along to a festival...Nope...my mind is just a blank. I know there must be SOMETHING one can take to a festival, but it&#039;s at the tip of my tongue. Seems like the answer is sooo close, yet sooo far away. If only I could put my finger on it......hmmmmmm

				Adderal if you want to stay up for consecutive days. Then you can smoke some weed at night time if you&#039;re going to sleep.<br /><br />I would say Adderal, Cocaine, Shrooms, and alcohol. Any mixture of those you should have a good time.<br /><br />If you take enough Adderal you can stay up for days without any problem.

				For your favourite bands it&#039;ll have to be MDMA, nothing else compares. Acid if you can handle it, and weed to tide you over and just chill out in the mornings before music and late at night before bed.
