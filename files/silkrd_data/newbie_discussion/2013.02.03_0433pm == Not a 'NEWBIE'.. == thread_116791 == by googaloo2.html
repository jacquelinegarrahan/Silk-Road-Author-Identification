				Ive been here for around a year, had lots transactions and spent a fair bit of monies... I have also reviewed products. Its been a while since I logged in and just tried to make a post to discover these new rules..<br />I just don&#039;t post in the forums that much..Is there any MOD reading this that can verify these facts and let me post in the actual forum?&nbsp; I understand the point of it, but feel that as I am clearly not a newbie, I should be able to post in the main forum... I have just placed an order for the first time in a while and would like to discuss it... Any help appreciated.<br />Thanks..

It is not the same issue, yours is a little strange, i didnt now it was that strict..<br /><br />My problem is just very irritating as i am sure you can understand&nbsp; :o

				Did they just change something? I was wondering why it wouldn&#039;t let me post in the other forums like it used to. Pretty dumb rule if you ask me, not everyone creates a forum name when they start using SR.

				yes mdmagice.. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;FREE ME! It is indeed irritating. Falsely imprisoned in the newbie forum. Yeah I can see why they have done it but I dont reckon its the best way of trying to stop spammers/scammers.. Not that I have a better idea. I cant be assed to spam shit to reach 50 either its not about that... meh.&nbsp; Yeah i&#039;m not sure when they changed it as its been ages since I last tried to post but seeing as the newbie forum is 72 pages deep i assume it was a while ago...<br />my stats for anyone in any position to change anything..<br />&nbsp;Total transactions: 24<br />&nbsp;Total spent: à¸¿183.83<br />&nbsp;Refund rate: 0%<br />&nbsp;Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />&nbsp;Member for: 10 months

				anyone stuck in the newbie forum should just try to come up with really interesting topics for discussion here so that conversation flows freely and everyone gets bumped up faster&nbsp; ;D
