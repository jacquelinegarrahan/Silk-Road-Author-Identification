				(Noob trying to make my first transaction.)<br /><br />Almost 50 confirmation and 4.5 hours at time of posting. <br /><br />The destination address doesn&#039;t match my SR address. Though, I&#039;ve read on here that SR&#039;s tumbling will mask the destination. But there&#039;s also the fact that blockchain is showing that this address has received the funds. All I did was copy/paste my SR address, so I don&#039;t know how I could have screwed it up, especially in a away that just happened to be a valid BTC address.<br /><br />I used the &quot;send shared&quot; feature if that&#039;s relevant.<br /><br />Did I lose the money or should I just be more patient?

				Pretty sure it can take a little while longer, so I&#039;d wait a little bit more...but if you are super worried you can always post in the support forums or ask SR admin.

				Thanks. I&#039;m a little worried since when I punch my SR address in blockchain, it shows 0 transactions, but I&#039;ll wait a&nbsp; bit before contacting support.

				Yeah, one time I transferred money from my SR account to my BTC wallet and it took at least half a day to even show up as a transaction. I thought it was lost money, but it did show up. The only downside (debatable) to BTC is its a waiting time :P

				6 hours in, so I contacted support. Hopefully this gets resolved soon-ish. I&#039;d like to get my order placed over the weekend

				I just want to add a resolution to this for any future readers who may be having the same issue.<br /><br />20.5 hours after I initiated the transfer, the BTC showed up in my SR account. I contacted both SR and blockchain support, but haven&#039;t gotten a response from either yet, so I think it just resolved itself<br /><br />To summarize what I did so that to reassure future searchers:<br />- Paid cash at MoneyGram location for BitInstant to Blockchain.info wallet<br />- bc.info wallet to different bc.info wallet via regular send feature<br />- second bc.info wallet to SR wallet via send-shared feature<br />- From there the BTC went to a different address and my SR wallet showed no transactions whatsoever. The transaction to the wrong wallet racked up about 175 confirmations before it moved on elsewhere in different amounts. I had pretty much given up hope at this point, but I guess this is either how SR&#039;s tumbler works or Blockchain&#039;s send-shared or both.<br /><br />Hope this helps you, person from the future.

				Shared send can take forever if you don&#039;t pay the small fee to get the miners to process it.<br /><br />Just bite the bullet and pay the 0.05BTC or whatever it is and it happens much, much faster.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I think I did pay the shared send fee, and it was 0.005 BTC, but I&#039;m guessing that is what caused it to take so long.<br /><br />The time isn&#039;t that big of a deal, but it was a little stressful for a first timer.

				That sucks, I didn&#039;t pay the fee and it nearly took 24 hrs for a transfer, I guess you just have to be patient.<br /><br />BitcoinFog is a minimum of 6hrs but the fee is 1-3%<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor
