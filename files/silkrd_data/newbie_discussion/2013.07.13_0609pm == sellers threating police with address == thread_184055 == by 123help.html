				And this is why I try to remain on good terms with all vendors no matter what happens.<br /><br />But what&#039;s he going to say?&nbsp; Hey, I sold drugs to this guy on the internet, here&#039;s his address.<br /><br />By law, they can&#039;t do anything anyway besides just go over to your house and try to use sneaky tactics to get more info.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the law as I&#039;ve researched it. They need 2 pieces for a warrant.... Or maybe just the last one.<br /><br />1) A tip off, like, if someone told the police where you lived and that you were doing drugs is the first piece.<br /><br />2) The second piece they need is called &quot;corroboration&quot; (wikipedia it)&nbsp; Corrorboration as I understand it is the police or whomever &quot;seeing, hearing, sensing, or you insinuating anything indicating illegal activity, etc.&quot;&nbsp; Let&#039;s say you seem really out of it and are on drugs, or you say something that slightly insinuates you have illegal stuff inside your place, or maybe even if your pupils are dialated....I&#039;m not exactly sure on how far it goes but I know..well police will try to trick you...and can...and will lie.&nbsp; Also, who are people going to be more likely to believe in a court of law even if the officer did lie to get in?<br /><br />You or him?<br /><br />Once they get those two pieces, as far as I&#039;ve researched, they can get a warrant to search your house.<br /><br />Otherwise, they will probably come to your door one day (maaaaybe) and then ASK to come in or do something else like ask to use the restroom.<br /><br />They may make up a reason such as &quot;we&#039;ve heard of some people around here getting their stuff stolen and we&#039;ve noticed that the theives have been able to get only to houses that have this type of lock on their door&quot; or some bulllshit like that.&nbsp; It&#039;s essentially they&#039;re job to trick people so they can get corroboration and thus obtain a warrant.&nbsp; If it was your job to trick people into getting corroboration for...say...10 years, don&#039;t you think you&#039;d be good at it?<br /><br />They may say they are the IRS or something (although I&#039;m fuzzy on the laws about that if they have to identify themselves as actual police/investigators).<br /><br />What I DO KNOW is that if you ask a police officer what rights you have right now/what the laws are regarding the scenario currently present they HAVE to tell you.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t or won&#039;t then I&#039;d believe (although I&#039;m not a lawyer) that any information or anything they saw/heard/got without you asking them about first and them not telling you would be considered false evidence/corroboration.<br /><br />Anyways, if/when they come knocking (and you have illegal stuff at your place) you better think of a good and reasonable excuse to not let them in.&nbsp; Say you just gassed the place for insects and open the door with a mask on....and you dont want to get them sick.&nbsp; Say your dog doesn&#039;t like strangers and you worry for their safety.&nbsp; Say you&#039;re place is too messy and you&#039;re embarrassed about it but can chat outside.&nbsp; Say you&#039;re late for class or a doctors appointment and HAVE to leave RIGHT now.&nbsp; Say you have to take a MASSIVE sh!t and just can&#039;t hold it any longer...you&#039;ll have to talk to them later.<br /><br />Additionally..they&#039;ll always come in pairs - and most likely - theyre strategy would be to split up.&nbsp; You can&#039;t keep track of two people at once especially while one sneaks around.<br /><br />&nbsp;You&#039;ll feel sketchy not letting them in...and they may try to look more closely at you in whatever manner they can if you refuse to let them in but...just DON&#039;T LET THEM IN.&nbsp; EVEN IF A BEAR STARTS ATTACKING THEM - CLOSE THE DOOR AND MAKE THEM STAY OUTSIDE.<br /><br />The other issue is if you have roommates - cause that&#039;ll be fun.&nbsp; Roommates can let the officers in even if you say no and this can get very tricky.&nbsp; If you have a designated part of the house that is considered yours (like your room) keep everything in there.&nbsp; If that is your designated part of the house - you can refuse to let them into that part of the house...so just go in there and lock the door.&nbsp; If they try to come in...well you&#039;ll have to think of another excuse.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about not falling for their sneakiness, not letting them in no matter what, etc.<br /><br />A tip off is nothing more than a tip off.&nbsp; A tip off does not allow them to get access to a warrant.&nbsp; A tip off + corroboration does.<br /><br />Any rep would be appreciated :)&nbsp; I feel this information is pretty useful.

				Cops can&#039;t just come arrest you or even search your place just because someone tipped them off to your address lol.<br /><br />If you think the threat is serious, obviously get rid of or hide anything illegal and don&#039;t order anything else. <br /><br />To search your place that have to be able to point their finger at something and say &quot;Hey they looks like illegal activity&quot; and a judge has to agree afterwards.<br /><br />If the police show up right away, you could just not answer the door. They can not break in. <br /><br />When you do answer the door for the police they will ask &quot;can we come in for a minute?&quot;. Tell them no. <br /><br />Say something like &quot;No I&#039;m sorry but you can&#039;t come in. No offense it&#039;s just that I have run into a few pushy police officers. I was even harassed for over an hour once because my car looked like a car that someone had been using to break into people vehicles and steal stuff.&quot;<br /><br />

				Mr. Jones, a lot of good information in there. One thing I gotta disagree with though is that if they don&#039;t have a warrant you don&#039;t need an excuse to keep them out. &quot;I can&#039;t let you in without a warrant.&quot; That&#039;s what I told the S.B.I. when they came a knocking after they received an &quot;anonymous tip&quot; that I was manufacturing methamphetamine. They proceeded to tell me &quot;If you make us go get a warrant and come back here we&#039;re gonna tear your house apart.&quot; I called their bluff and told them I&#039;d be waiting. That was the last I heard from them. Scare tactics, plain and simple. Don&#039;t let the pigs intimidate you. You are well within your rights to tell them to remove themselves from your property because they are trespassing. You are certainly right though when you say they will lie and do or say just about anything to get inside of your house. But the simple fact is that if they had something on you they&#039;d show up with warrant in hand. I&#039;m not a keyboard cowboy, either. When the situation arose I did exactly what said I did. I get a devilish joy out of giving the fuzz a hard time anytime the opportunity presents itself. Twice I&#039;ve been pulled over and had nothing on me and when asked if my car could be searched said the same thing; &quot;Not without a warrant.&quot; In one instance they brought a K-9 to smell the outside of my car. Of course he alerted (when the officer gave him the command to alert) and they searched and of course found nothing. The other time the pigs talked the situation over amongst themselves for a while then told me I was free to go. Their power has to be kept in check. They are way too used to getting their way. I implore everyone out there, if you know that your vehicle or your home is clean, make them work for it. It may delay you if you&#039;re driving but again, pigs need to understand that they can&#039;t just get their way all of the time. Oh and by the way, I&#039;m far from being a meth cook. I can barely boil an egg. The &quot;anonymous tip&quot;.... it was a pissed off ex-girlfriend who thought it would be funny to tell the cops I was cooking meth.

They need 2 pieces for a warrant.... Or maybe just the last one.<br /><br />1) A tip off, like, if someone told the police where you lived and that you were doing drugs is the first piece.<br /><br />2) The second piece they need is called &quot;corroboration&quot; (wikipedia it)&nbsp; Corrorboration as I understand it is the police or whomever &quot;seeing, hearing, sensing, or you insinuating anything indicating illegal activity, etc.&quot;&nbsp; Let&#039;s say you seem really out of it and are on drugs, or you say something that slightly insinuates you have illegal stuff inside your place, or maybe even if your pupils are dialated....I&#039;m not exactly sure on how far it goes but I know..well police will try to trick you...and can...and will lie.&nbsp; Also, who are people going to be more likely to believe in a court of law even if the officer did lie to get in?<br /><br />You or him?<br /><br />Once they get those two pieces, as far as I&#039;ve researched, they can get a warrant to search your house.<br /><br />Otherwise, they will probably come to your door one day (maaaaybe) and then ASK to come in or do something else like ask to use the restroom.<br /><br />They may make up a reason such as &quot;we&#039;ve heard of some people around here getting their stuff stolen and we&#039;ve noticed that the theives have been able to get only to houses that have this type of lock on their door&quot; or some bulllshit like that.&nbsp; It&#039;s essentially they&#039;re job to trick people so they can get corroboration and thus obtain a warrant.&nbsp; If it was your job to trick people into getting corroboration for...say...10 years, don&#039;t you think you&#039;d be good at it?<br /><br />They may say they are the IRS or something (although I&#039;m fuzzy on the laws about that if they have to identify themselves as actual police/investigators).<br /><br />What I DO KNOW is that if you ask a police officer what rights you have right now/what the laws are regarding the scenario currently present they HAVE to tell you.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t or won&#039;t then I&#039;d believe (although I&#039;m not a lawyer) that any information or anything they saw/heard/got without you asking them about first and them not telling you would be considered false evidence/corroboration.<br /><br />Anyways, if/when they come knocking (and you have illegal stuff at your place) you better think of a good and reasonable excuse to not let them in.&nbsp; Say you just gassed the place for insects and open the door with a mask on....and you dont want to get them sick.&nbsp; Say your dog doesn&#039;t like strangers and you worry for their safety.&nbsp; Say you&#039;re place is too messy and you&#039;re embarrassed about it but can chat outside.&nbsp; Say you&#039;re late for class or a doctors appointment and HAVE to leave RIGHT now.&nbsp; Say you have to take a MASSIVE sh!t and just can&#039;t hold it any longer...you&#039;ll have to talk to them later.<br /><br />Additionally..they&#039;ll always come in pairs - and most likely - theyre strategy would be to split up.&nbsp; You can&#039;t keep track of two people at once especially while one sneaks around.<br /><br />&nbsp;You&#039;ll feel sketchy not letting them in...and they may try to look more closely at you in whatever manner they can if you refuse to let them in but...just DON&#039;T LET THEM IN.&nbsp; EVEN IF A BEAR STARTS ATTACKING THEM - CLOSE THE DOOR AND MAKE THEM STAY OUTSIDE.<br /><br />The other issue is if you have roommates - cause that&#039;ll be fun.&nbsp; Roommates can let the officers in even if you say no and this can get very tricky.&nbsp; If you have a designated part of the house that is considered yours (like your room) keep everything in there.&nbsp; If that is your designated part of the house - you can refuse to let them into that part of the house...so just go in there and lock the door.&nbsp; If they try to come in...well you&#039;ll have to think of another excuse.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about not falling for their sneakiness, not letting them in no matter what, etc.<br /><br />A tip off is nothing more than a tip off.&nbsp; A tip off does not allow them to get access to a warrant.&nbsp; A tip off + corroboration does.<br /><br />Any rep would be appreciated :)&nbsp; I feel this information is pretty useful.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MrJones that is great post and very informative, thanks very much, but I do respectfully disagree with some of your points. I can&#039;t speak of anywhere but the US, but one thing I know for sure is that it is a total load of bs that LE have to read you your rights when arresting you, or if you talk before they read your rights (if they ever do) that it&#039;s not admissible in court. They can and will use what you said against you regardless of what they&#039;ve told you or not told you. Has happened to me in the past when I was younger and MUCH dumber. Oh how I wish I had the wonderful info provided here in my younger days, would have saved me a LOT of money and trouble, but that&#039;s just wishful thinking :)<br /><br />For some additional REALLY good info, look up on youtube &quot;10 rules to dealing with the police&quot; by flexyourrights.com. They have some great informational videos, some actually from lawyers and police, and the number one thing both the lawyer and the cop said was DO NOT TALK TO LE!!! They take the stance that even if you THINK you are law abiding citizen, you have still broken some law, and it&#039;s true if you think about it. Even your innocent grandma probably speeds on the highway occasionally (well mine did anyway). If the police come to my door and I or no one else in my home called them, I&#039;m not answering the door period. We all know what happens if they have a warrant, they aren&#039;t going to knock that&#039;s for sure. Even if you think you know what you are doing, DO NOT TALK. LE are pros at being liars and psychological manipulators (especially with younger naive folks), and if you talk, they may just get what they need for their probable cause to enter your residence or secure a warrant (keep in mind they don&#039;t need a warrant if smell anything illicit so no open door equals LESS chance of smelling).<br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s my two cents, thanks for reading!

				Jesus dude, like everyone else has said, get rid of/ move off site all your illegal stuff, and make sure you clean your (im going to assume you smoke) smoking area; believe it or not they only need a &quot;smokable amount&quot; to give you a POM.<br />That being said, whenever I go over to a friends house and I find little BB sized nugs or a few tiny sized pieces of weed on the floor, I grab them and lecture the fuck out of them. Why? Because cops will sit there and pick every little piece of weed up hoping to obtain a &quot;smokable&quot; amount. then say high to a POM. or whatever drugs.<br /><br />Moral of the story is clean your house like you were going to perform surgery.<br /><br />If shit like that happened to me I&#039;d be wistfully looking in the services section of other, less friendly black markets than SR, if you know what im saying. If you have a problem with some one you smack them steal from them do whatever, but you never call the fucking law. Thats just fucked
