WHAT IS AN EASY WAY TO GET SOME FUCKING BITCOINS AROUND HERE??<br /><br />then the delivery. my friend is going to set up a po box in his name. then he is going to change his us mailing address to that of the po box. we do not want to ship to our house cause that is where the drugs will be kept. is sending to a po box ill adviced<br /><br />then theres the wifi problem.. <br /><br />right now im on my neighbors. but when it comes to actually getting the bitcoins into a wallet i will use a public wifi. am i leaving trails by using my neighbors wifi right now?<br /><br /><br /><br />theeeeeen the mdma i want is from marijuana is my muse, what are the chances of getting a package coming from canada to the US seized?<br /><br /><br />sorry, im really just ranting. over the next week im going to spend a lot of time researching. i figured i would make this post just in case some kind soul would link me in the right direction to some of the issues im having. ive only done legit mdma once. it was magical. but 15 for .1 is absurd. i want my own direct connection, SOME ONE PLEASE HELP ME

				You don&#039;t need PGP to send PMs on the forum. Generally PGP will be used to encrypt your address when sending to a vendor and that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />I&#039;m far from an expert but I believe the general consensus seems to be that a PO box isn&#039;t the best idea. Going out of your way to have &quot;this&quot; mail shipped to a different address may show you were expecting something illicit vs it just randomly appearing at your house. In the end it probably doesn&#039;t matter either way.<br /><br />I have seen several recommendations for bitinstant to purchase BTC. Allows several options such as paying in cash at locations. Worth checking out at least.<br /><br />Keep reading guide(s) and it will all click eventually.
