				Anyone here tried this?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think smuggling even small amounts through customs is so wise.&nbsp; What about arranging with a vendor to have it arrive the hotel a day or so after you do?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And GO...........

				Seems a little excessive. Don&#039;t you just know of an abandoned building or a house that&#039;s on the market? Besides, you can&#039;t really be arrested for receiving drugs in the mail. As long as you don&#039;t admit to it, there is nothing proving that the drugs were ordered by you. Besides, it&#039;s not like the seller is going to come to you&#039;re house or anything. Most of the sellers are cool, besides, a review stating &quot;I ordered from Joe Shmoe and he showed up at my house the next morning and stole my launch money&quot; Sellers depend on their rep to sell.

				I guess my OP wasn&#039;t clear.&nbsp; If I was traveling outside of my country, so transporting on my person is not an option, would receiving at a hotel be a viable option?<br /><br />Mostly interested in anyone that has tried this, although all comments are welcomed.

				There have actually been several threads about this in the past. I think they were in the &#039;Shipping&#039; section of the forum.<br /><br />One in particular I remember was a dude sending some speed and some hits of NBOMe to a hotel in Japan. I remember him for sure receiving the NBOMe, but I never saw him repost about the speed.

				I did this last summer, had weed delivered to my hotel twice in the 2 weeks I was there. It was in Malta and it was just your bog standard all inclusive style resort. <br /><br />So yeah, it works.
