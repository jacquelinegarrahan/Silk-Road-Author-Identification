				lets say the package gets to destination, but the person there whose name it is under isnt there to sign for it if it was a controlled delivery do you think they would just let the roomate take it so they could get in the door at a later time or do what the guy did and leave the we missed you notice telling him to call that number to pick it up<br /><br />friends is sketched out because of the question post man was asking (which i understand ) , so he denied the package. <br /><br />

				(my gf is a lawyer here in cali, so my info is only valid in the us)<br /><br />If it is a CD they wont use a real post man. they would be giving a controlled sustance to someone other than a cop which is a no go for them. It may have been a cop in a usps uniform of course. (which they are allowed to do) If they do a CD they will take the person who takes the package right then and there, they wont try and wait on the person when someone else has control of the package. that just give you time to move or hide it and risks it dissappearing. <br /><br />What kind of questions was the post man asking?<br /><br />I sign for my roommates packages all the time and they for mine, post people see it all the time and doesnt raise a red flag unless it isnt a name they have seen with that address. <br /><br />Just a little advice get to know your postman. Everytime you see them start a little small talk. You will learn who does your route and on what days. That way anything out of the ordinary will raise major red flags.

				according to my friend he was asking is he home or at work and could you call him.. and then when my friend was going to leave he showed him the package and asked if that was the package his friend was looking for.<br /><br />but even though it was sketchy, im just thinking for what it was and the amount i dont think LE would give up the oppurnity because the roomate who&#039;s name was under wasn&#039;t home to sign for it.&nbsp; and thats why i wanted an opinion because ita currently sitting at the PO<br /><br />also, <br />We&#039;ve talked to the vendor and he said with express sometimes it will be a different carrier, and i explained the whole situation and he dont think it was a CD either. and i dont think he was bullshiting because he said no matter what he would give refund. <br />

				It does not sound likely. Express mail is also controlled and protected by the fourth amendment only a US postal inspector with a court issued warrant can even look inside it no less attempt to get you for receiving contraband.

				vendor also told me they dont usually do controlled delivery at the PO because theyd would have to wait for you to go, but the PO did say call this number to schedule a pick up but when we looked at the number online for the PO to go to they didnt match up<br /><br />but in your guys opnion should we attempt to retrieve it, and do you&nbsp; think itd be a good idea to send someone&nbsp; else who doesnt have any connection to us&nbsp; because theyve never asked for an ID aslong as we had the slip

				Your friend was very wise to reject the package. For certain &#039;smaller amounts&#039; the postal inspectors will personally visit the residents and just ask you to open the package. If it&#039;s usps they can&#039;t open it without a warrant so postal inspectors will come by the house and try to convince you to show them it&#039;s not contraband. UPS and FedEx can open whatever the fuck they want and have the most CD&#039;s. If it looked like your normal post man it was probably an attempted CD. If it was just a regular dude trying to get ahold of your friend, then it was the postal inspector trying to get permission to see whats in the package. Advice him to clean his house, because if they find large amounts of controlled substances they will search. and warrants dont take long to get. <br /><br />Ryno

				oh its clean but thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;its been a week and half nothing has happened, but like i said i just dont think they would just say ok the person who&#039;s name its under isnt there lets forget it because it was a bulk amount not little personals i feel like they would want to get somebody. or would have done something by now
