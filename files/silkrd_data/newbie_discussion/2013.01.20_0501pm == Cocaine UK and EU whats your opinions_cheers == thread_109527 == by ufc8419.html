				<br /><br />Hello Brothers, i know there is countless posts on the forum but i would like to ask my fellow people....<br /><br />Who would you recommend for cocaine in UK and also EU and why?? if thats ok to ask you 8)<br /><br />Do you find theres vendors selling good clean euphoric gear at pices slightly below the top line on SR and who would you personally recommend?<br /><br />I know that batches can change and that is just the nature of the beast, but who have you been impressed with recently?<br /><br />All the best <br /><br />UFC

				I&#039;ve had two experiences with Lloydsbrothers, first was good, second not so much but many people seem to really rate their stuff so my last experience may have just been a one off.&nbsp; I have also heard good things about Budworx from people whose opinions I trust. Both these vendors are quite expensive though so not sure if this is in line with the question you are asking.<br /><br />If I were looking at other EU vendors I would probably consider Mercury31, CharlieandMollie, Frank Mathews and MMM as worth a look and that&#039;s not an exhaustive list, there are plenty more to chose from.<br /><br />Hope that helps, go and have a good read of the cocaine thread for more info too.

				I agree with samesame regarding Lloydsbrothers, the first lot I got was great but the second was not so good. Well, it was good but not good for the price and that&#039;s the problem. If I&#039;m paying 150% the price of top rate cocaine for something that is rumoured to be excellent but might be just good street coke, most of the time I&#039;d be better off just buying it offline.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard good things about Budworx but haven&#039;t sampled it yet.

If I&#039;m paying 150% the price of top rate cocaine for something that is rumoured to be excellent but might be just good street coke, most of the time I&#039;d be better off just buying it offline.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard good things about Budworx but haven&#039;t sampled it yet. Not sure I can justify the price, maybe I&#039;ll get some when I&#039;m next feeling flush.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hello,<br /><br />We have lowered our prices to a more competitive rate.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nice. I&#039;ll sample your gear in the next couple of weeks, consider yourself bookmarked!

				I&#039;ve found Dr Col very reliable and fast UK to UK. His coke is also top notch IMO.<br /><br />He also has the advantage that he is slightly cheaper than Lloyds Bros.<br /><br />
