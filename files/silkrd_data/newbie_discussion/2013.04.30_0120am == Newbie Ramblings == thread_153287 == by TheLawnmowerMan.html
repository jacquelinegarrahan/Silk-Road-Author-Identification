				I&#039;ve been reading a lot of these forum posts on the inaccessibility of the SilkRoad. I&#039;m a newbie to the silkroad and I have not yet accessed or used it. I just hope this technical problem can be resolved so I can access it at least once.<br /><br />Does anyone know if my virus protection software could be meddling with the Tor Browser&#039;s ability to make a connection to the SilkRoad? This is the only other factor that I can perceive causing this disruption. That is...aside from any hacking or third-party attacks upon the SilkRoad which have been repeatedly mentioned throughout various blogospheres.<br /><br />My frustrations have been somewhat appeased though after scrolling through posts such as this one that discuss the current inaccessiblity of the SilkRoad. <br />I can see that I am not the only one you is unable to access it and I was getting worried that I had not followed the simple instructions on accessing the SilkRoad.<br /><br />I guess this is a case when one must simply Try, Try, Again!<br /><br />Oh, internet gods, Help this poor website in its darkest hour. LOL

				I doubt your antivirus would have any effect on it, but what are you using for AV?<br /><br />One thing I&#039;ve found in the short time I&#039;ve been using Tor, websites on the Onion Network are generally going to be less stable than those on the clearnet; so downtime is MUCH more common and shouldn&#039;t be seen as cause for alarm.<br />

				You just have to be patient. The Silk Road has been down for much longer than a few days before. The site&#039;s never been 100% reliable and quick like on the regular internet. That&#039;s just the nature of this kind of thing. Sometimes it&#039;s been pretty fast, other times not. fact is they got the forums up, they just have to work on the regular site.

				Well buying illegal things has hardly ever been an easy thing, and I kind of expected there would be problems even with the infamous SilkRoad.<br /><br />Well I&#039;ll just be patient for the time being.<br /><br />I hope somebody posts right away whenever the site is accessible again.<br /><br />Is there any specific time when the SilkRoad seems to be more accessible? Such as on weekends or late at night? I just don&#039;t want to miss an open window if it&#039;s only going to be there for a short time.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m using TrendMicro from Microsoft. But I don&#039;t think this is the problem b/c I&#039;ve seen my friend access the site on my computer, and that was a few days ago....just before it crawled back into it&#039;s virtual foxhole!

				If you can access the forums, you can access Silk Road ... once it&#039;s back up again.
