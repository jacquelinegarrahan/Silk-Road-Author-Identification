				I&#039;m interested in how people use the SR forums, whether it is primarily to facilitate the trade, learn more on a variety of topics, or something else entirely.<br /><br />I&#039;m here because of the ideas, this is an exciting new area of technology and commere, and I want to watch it first-hand.

				I mean, I use it primarily for the rumor mill, to see what other users have said about a vendor or product.&nbsp; also, to talk about how to use sr, pgp, etc.<br />

				Well it put my mind at rest reading the forums as it showed me SR really does work. I am far too suspicious&nbsp; a person to just accept that SR was not just some scam and all these thousands of posts sort of made me feel like it was real.
