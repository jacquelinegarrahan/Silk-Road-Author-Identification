				Listen to me when I say this. DO NOT FE for any vendor. I have learned this the hard way. When you FE you lose everything no matter what. Lots of shady vendors lately.

				Very true, my first order i was asked to FE by Dr Holland and good thing i didnt because.. well.. just look at his feedback. Only ever FE if the vendor is 100% trusted and you don&#039;t mind losing the money, cause once you finalize there&#039;s a good chance you will lose it

				Saying that, on my second order i went to amethyst (Sp?) without looking at his profile he requires min of 5 transactions. Ended up messaging him saying i would FE... Luckily it paid off for me.

				Good advice to ALL.<br /><br />NOBODY should EVER be asked to FE. <br /><br />(Only exception would be if YOU are asking the Vendor to do something outwith his regular process and you mutually agreed to it).<br /><br />The ESCROW system&#039;s PURPOSE is to protect BOTH the buyer/seller and is the ONLY way that you can take an issue to the resolution center.<br /><br />New buyers should always initially buy small; FE on delivery and get their reputations up.&nbsp; Also, speak to the vendors and build up a rapport and their trust.<br /><br />Vendors often PM other Vendors for feedback reviews on a &quot;new buyers&quot; previous transactions, which can help them decide whether to carry out a deal or not.<br /><br />In an anonymous world, trust is the only thing we have and ESCROW is the &quot;safety net&quot; used if that trust is ever broken on either side of the fence.<br /><br />Good Thread and as stated, VERY important advice.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES.

				If someone asks you to FE then just pick another vendor.<br /><br />There are plenty of them. You might pay a little more on your orders then, but that&#039;s better than being cheated for all your money.<br /><br />Then if the FE asking vendor is still interesting, you can ask him later if he now is ready to take orders without FE...<br /><br />If not, just tell him you will look back later then instead.. There must be a reason for not wanting your money..

				Vendors like to bribe and sweeten deals to get more BTC. Really good advice is to pay a little more and not get greedy because in the end you get the shaft!~~

				People say don&#039;t FE over and over. But of course later people FE and get scammed. Then they start wondering how they can get the money back. You can&#039;t! Don&#039;t FE if you want to be safe.
