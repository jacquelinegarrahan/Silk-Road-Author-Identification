				Hey guys<br /><br />I posted this on reddit/r/lsd but then I found this place. <br /><br />I ordered 25 LSD blotters Gandalfs 150ug from JersyCow on SR about 2 weeks back. I know he had some weak batches that people complained about. At the time of purchase, I reviewed threads that stated the problem was rectified. I messaged JC and specifically asked him if there are any more issues with weak batches and he said that the weak ones have been sorted out, assuring me that the new batch was good. I got them on Monday ...and they have an olive green border.<br /><br />I FE&#039;d on the day I received the package, before trying the product - was just happy I received it and sure that I could trust JC. I intend to take 2 tabs mid June with a bunch of friends (who will also do 2 each)...but I just looked up recent reviews on SR and my heart sunk! I&#039;ve found so many people complaining about the product having no effect and I&#039;m worried now that I may be one of those unlucky people.<br />Did any of you buy from JerseyCow recently? If so, how was it?<br /><br />**My boyfriend has tested 1 tab. Here&#039;s the trip report...please let me know if it&#039;s on par for 150ug. He&#039;s had LSD a few times but years ago so no tolerance.**<br /><br />Trip Report:<br />14:05 - He dropped 1 tab (150ug olive green bordered gandalf from JC)...should kick in in a little while..he noticed a bitter taste but thinks it&#039;s the ink...it only lasted about 2-3 minutes and was not that strong a taste.<br />15:12 - he is definitely feeling &quot;strange&quot; and a little anxiety (that&#039;s normal when coming up) and a bit weak at the knees...no definitive trippiness yet...<br />15:25 - he says &quot;the edges of my vision are flickering&quot; - lol - but only very slightly and infrequently.<br />15:45 - he isn&#039;t seeing much yet aside from the &quot;flickering&quot;, but a feeling of slight euphoria is taking over slowly as well as feelings of &quot;tingly nervousness&quot; through his body.<br />16:05 - 2 hours in now...but not much progress. He&#039;s finding movie trailers very amusing though. (shouldn&#039;t there be more happening by now guys?)<br />17:26 - slight &quot;breathing&quot; effect of the curtains if he stares long enough but no pattern movement. Not too impressive visuals. He says he can even control it and make it stop. Says he has to really try hard to make things move and even then if he breaks concentration it stops. He has done LSD before so he knows as far as euphoria and feelings go, it feels right - just weak. The visuals are underwhelming, no deep introspection etc...and it&#039;s not taking him as deep as we expected right now.<br />18:03 - he is definitely past the peak now. :( But he says he still feels slight euphoria. I don&#039;t know. Maybe we&#039;ll have to do 3-4 tabs for the party? It&#039;s not strong at all.<br />07:42 - He is still slightly euphoric, calm, took him for a drive around the neighborhood, he is finding appreciation in nature and feels like the lights have a slightly emotional effect. Still very with me on earth though. Also his judgement of time is a little strange though not completely diminished. Thinks everything is beautiful. :)<br />09:31 - he is feeling happy and he says he feels &quot;massaged&quot; - like his body feels relaxed. The visuals are totally gone. The experience wasn&#039;t that mind-altering or anything. He thinks we&#039;ll need like 6 tabs each if we want a mind-blowing experience.<br /><br />Please guys, do read the report and let me know if this experience is on par for 150ug? I&#039;d really like to know if we accidentally got a subpar batch from JC. I&#039;m not sure if 150 is supposed to do more as we&#039;ve had much stronger visuals and deeper experiences (feeling outside of ourselves, connected to everything, patterns moving on their own, colors blending etc.) on a single tab years ago (from a different source) and we didn&#039;t know the dosage of those tabs.<br /><br />Given the effects above, how many would you recommend we take each? We have 24 left between 4 people.&nbsp;
