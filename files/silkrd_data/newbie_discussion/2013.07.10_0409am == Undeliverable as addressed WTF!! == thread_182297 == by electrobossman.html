				I know I made a topic about this a couple of days ago but would like a broader amount of feedback from both buyers and vendors dealing with this problem. I understand most that receive this have used a fake address. I&#039;m going to go ahead and assume that my vendor knows what he&#039;s doing and wouldn&#039;t fuck up my address due to the waste of time it is for him plus the fact that he&#039;s a perfect 100. Now I&#039;ve got the tracking and have watched it being scanned, and if it were a bad address why would it have shown up in my town. I just saw an update saying this after the undeliverable as addressed update....<br /><br />Your item was processed through and left our facility on July 9, 2013 at 10:41 pm. The item is currently in transit to the destination. Information, if available, is updated periodically throughout the day. Please check again later. <br /><br />My main question is has anyone ever received their package after receiving a undeliverable as addressed to a correct address? The more I think about this the more pissed of I get because I know USPS fucked up obviously because they can&#039;t provide any sort of assistance. Though it&#039;s being scanned just fine, I&#039;m just trying to figure out if it&#039;s just going to make a big loop or what the hell is going on. Never had a problem like this when getting packages. I had a package airmailed from the UK with my first name only and made it here fine so I know USPS screwed up. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

				If you don&#039;t do anything it&#039;ll be returned, which would suck.&nbsp; If the vendor used a real return address the owner of the address might (depending on what you ordered) call the police when your parcel ends up in their mailbox. If he used a fake one, it&#039;ll get opened up at the dead letter office. Either way someone else will be opening it, which is kinda the last thing you want.&nbsp; (Also if it&#039;s the vendor&#039;s word against yours it&#039;ll be too easy for him to claim you were the one who gave an address that didn&#039;t check out &amp; refuse a refund/reship based on that). <br /><br />So you just need to make sure it&#039;s not returned. Act like someone tracking a normal package would -&nbsp; call (burner phone plz) the post office &amp; find out why it&#039;s undeliverable. (Contact the vendor too).&nbsp; Some places won&#039;t deliver if the name doesn&#039;t match up, or maybe the vendor accidentally put the wrong street address on it or something. If you have the tracking number &amp; your name checks out in most cases they&#039;ll just let you come pick it up. Otherwise they&#039;ll tell you to have the shipper contact them to update the address &amp; they&#039;ll reroute it back. Every time I&#039;ve had something get turned around this way it&#039;s usually not taken more than a call or two to sort things out. <br /><br />I know it sounds crazy, but this way is much better than doing nothing &amp; guaranteeing that someone else open it, esp if your actual name/address is on the package. It also saves you the headache of fighting things out with the vendor and (if you&#039;re lucky) waiting another week for a reship. <br /><br />Also for future reference this page has a list of all the reasons something might not get delivered:<br /><br />http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/507.htm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
