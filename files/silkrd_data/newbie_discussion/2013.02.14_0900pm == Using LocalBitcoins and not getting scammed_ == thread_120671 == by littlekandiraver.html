				So I&#039;ve been looking at https://localbitcoins.com to get bitcoins instead of going through dwolla and mt. gox like I originally planned.<br /><br />There&#039;s very little sellers in my area but I&#039;m not 100% how localbitcoins works.<br /><br />Is there a way to make sure the bitcoin seller is reputable and things to look out for?

				You place your order, the&nbsp; seller places the coins in escrow then you send the money via bank transfer.<br />Hit the PAYMENT SENT BUTTON.<br />When the seller checks they&#039;re bank account they release the coins<br />There&#039;s references numbers etc so if they don&#039;t send then you have proof that you did pay

				I went with bitinstant, and I got the coins immediately.&nbsp; I went with the cash to btc wallet option, and I had the coin in my wallet by the time I got back to my car.&nbsp; I can&#039;t recommend it enough.&nbsp; Although I have heard other people having some issues with getting their BTC&#039;s right away.&nbsp; I obviously had no such problem.&nbsp; You can even just send the btc&#039;s straight to your SR wallet and you should have them rather quickly. The whole process for me from sending the money to transferring to my SR account took less than an hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now I&#039;m just waiting for the vendor to update my order.&nbsp; I&#039;m really hoping it gets here by Saturday, as I paid for express and the vendor assured me if I got him the order before 3pm PST that I&#039;d have the order in my hand by Saturday.&nbsp;

				Pretty sure they have no choice about escrow.<br />You&#039;ll get a reference code so use it when you go to the bank
