				Miss mary jane keeps me warm when I&#039;m alone. Finding a lady to double team her has never been a problem...<br /><br />&#039;Cept afterwards, the lady leaves. Not a lotta cuddlers around here.<br /><br />:*(<br />But mary jane sticks around as long as I have money, and is always ready to pound.

				I feel ya. Meth gives me great focus to get things done, but it also makes me hyperfocus on my interactions with people. My self esteem is at an all time low so I can&#039;t handle any more assaults to my ego whether they be real or imaginary. As a result, I do drugs alone wishing I wasn&#039;t so lonely. Great life eh? <br />

				I much prefer getting high on my own. Partly because most people I know are so closed minded to any kind of drugs, but partly because I can only truly relax in my own company.<br /><br />I have my own personal views about H, it&#039;s a steep slippery slope for more than most. But meh, whatever floats your boat.

				Shiieet man. I just got to a crossroad in my life, where I went from couldn&#039;t get away from people enough, to not having anyone. It&#039;s easy to sit by yourself and smoke all day long, but I&#039;m choosing to take a little break and really focus on my future. Time to grow the fuck up I suppose.

				Smoke more weed and use other things less. Weed is a lot better to do by yourself on the regular.

				Obviously I enjoy sharing experiences with friends. However I do not want a whole lot people to know I do lsd, dmt, truffels or salvia.<br />So yes, I often do it by myself. Even just weed. I don&#039;t like it when other people are over and I just want to play some vidya, watch some films, ... and they are bored.<br />Like, it makes me feel a bit guilty, so I just do it on my own most of the time.<br /><br />2 nights ago I did dmt in combo with lsd and felt the entities/elves creeping up to me. I was sure nobody was in the room, but I could still see/feel them. Scared the shit out of me.<br />I&#039;m still not sure if I was glad nobody was there or if I would&#039;ve felt better.

				I am yet to try that combo. Sounds intense though. I never really do anything alone. Unless I&#039;m running a trial on some product I plan on giving to friends.
