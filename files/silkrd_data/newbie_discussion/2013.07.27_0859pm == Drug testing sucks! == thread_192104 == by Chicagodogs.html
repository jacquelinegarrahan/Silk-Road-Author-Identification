				I have been clean for over 3 years and not by choice. First, I moved out of state and lost my connections. Then I got a job that did random drug tests. But not knowing where to get anything, really didn&#039;t bother me. And I&#039;ve had 3 randoms so far. Now, that I found Silk Road and placed an order for some highly anticipated smoke. I now have to figure out a way around a random drug test. I&#039;ve heard of synthetic urine, but I also read that they have a new test that checks for synthetic urine. What am I going to do? Got any suggestions? Drug tests suck!

				I&#039;m not going to be much help on this because I forgot the important details. I went to my local headshop and asked the guy about testing and he gave me a pill. It was one pill and it had some very specific instructions on when to take it in relation to your testing.&nbsp; And here&#039;s where I fail. I can&#039;t remember the name of the pill. It was way easier than synthetic urine. That handwarmer rubber hose setup is a joke. The pill worked for me.

				I call bullshit on any pill...cannabinoids are stored in fat no pill is gonna stop you body from breaking down some fat...you will show positive for at least 40 days give or take 3-5 days on if you smoke more than&nbsp; 1 time a month.

				No man- it doesn&#039;t work like that. I was also skeptical. The pill &#039;treats&#039; your bladder, not your entire body. It&#039;s like drinking a bunch of cranberry juice. You have a limited window of clean piss before the chemicals begin to show.

				I don&#039;t my friend in which country you live but I wouldn&#039;t accept a job that has drug tests? I am mean Who are they to criticize what you do in your free time? If you can, change job. That is called biopolitic abuse in my language and it means that your employer has the right to tell you want to not do when you are not working. This is silly to my opinion..<br /><br />Take care my friend <br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />

				Sorry East India but I&#039;m with fucknut and eguy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken drug tests and 21 days of not smoking (after being a heavy smoker mind you) I could pass a test.&nbsp; Maybe your test was extra sensitive or you were an extra heavy smoker.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone here is doubting your experience, it&#039;s just that your experience seems atypical.<br /><br />Sidenote:&nbsp; What is the issue with opening clearnet links in your tor browser?&nbsp; Is that a no-no?&nbsp; Seems better than cruising them on your legit IP if it&#039;s sensitive info.
