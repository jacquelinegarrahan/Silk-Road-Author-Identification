				I&#039;ve noticed that a lot of hardcore drug users around here don&#039;t even know the secret to passing drug tests.&nbsp; I learned it a while back and was able to test it out several times.<br /><br />1: Go to the grocery store and buy some sure jell.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually in or near the baking isle. <br />2: Mix it with a gallon of water and start drinking it.&nbsp; Allow yourself some time to do this, because you will kill yourself if you drink a gallon of water too fast.<br />3: The sure jell will start blocking off your kidneys and you will start to feel discomfort in your kidney regions.<br />4: Pee a couple times before the actual test.<br />5: Go take the test and pass it.<br /><br />I did this after smoking a whole bunch of weed and doing other things the day before the test.&nbsp; You will be uncomfortable for a few hours after, but it&#039;s not that bad.&nbsp; People spend all this money on fancy strap on dicks and secret formulas... and sure jell is like 68 cents a pack.

				go to urineluck.com / spectrum labs. whatever you are taking the test for is worth $40, promise. because two things happen...<br /><br />follow directions. driving to test put bottle on defrost vents with defrost on med/high. target temp leaving car is 100-105 degrees. your defroster will get hotter than 105, good to have a friend along.<br /><br />if they test till 5pm go 40 minutes early. sign, sit, go. they say to empty pockets, just leave it in your pocket. do the whole unzip thing, squirt some liquid in toilet then cup till the line. make sure temp is right. if not and you freak out drop the cup on the toilet to make a mess, try again tomorrow (they close in 10 mins).<br /><br />using urineluck or similar does two things for you. you pass illegal drug test, and nobody can tell what legal medications you are taking. depression meds, anxiety meds, std meds... you&#039;ll *pass* all drug tests. if the test is for employment clean clean clean is the way to go.

				I used to collect urinalysis for the military when I was in, and the random drug tests that we gave were the standard 10-panel gc/ms tests. On a positive (ug/dl above cutoff point: below the cutoff you could still tell the substance was there, but it had to be reported as negative) result, the sample is re-tested 2 more times and if it fails either of those times, the report back is tested negative for drugs.<br /><br />Thing is: that shit is expensive, so what most places that randomly test employees often do is they gather batches and test random samples in the batch. I&#039;ve personally seen guys get caught on urinalysis failure that had been using during periods that they had passed other tests, simply because their sample was never tested.&nbsp; Now obviously for pre-employment screening or for probation or anything that is singling you out, your sample gets tested every time, but the message I&#039;m trying to get across is that you can&#039;t necessarily rely on past success to ensure future success when it comes to beating a drug test (unless you&#039;re actually clean).<br /><br />Now, there are substances that aren&#039;t tested for.&nbsp; Read up online for more info, but the 10-panel is the most common, 10 panel meaning that they only test for 10 things.&nbsp; The 10 things tested for are all &quot;recreational drugs&quot;, but at additional expense they can test for other substances (it&#039;s really expensive for some of them)

				I&#039;ve done a lot of research into drug tests before i started smoking again. I get randoms at work, and anytime there&#039;s an accident we have to get them.<br />I&#039;ve taken lots of drug tests, and passed every time with synthetic urine. Most smoke shops sell it as a novelty item, but it works.<br /><br />The hardest part is getting it the right temp. defroster works for warming it up if you&#039;re driving alone. That&#039;s what I usually do, and the I use Little Hotties toe warmers to keep it at the right temp. (right temp being between 90-100 degrees). I use the toe warmers because they come two in a pack with adhesive so they stick right to the bottle. If it&#039;s pre-heated, one will keep it at the right temperature for a few hours. If it&#039;s not pre-heated, depending on the starting temp, two will&nbsp; warm it up to over 100 for a couple hours. The bottle will come with a fish tank type temperature strip on it so you&#039;ll know what range you&#039;re in.<br /><br />The first time I went in I put it in my underwear &amp; was really nervous. All I&#039;ve ever gotten was to empty my pockets though, so now I just keep it in my sock. Much more secure. When I go, I have a single bathroom and I get to shut the door, so I can do whatever while in there.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found in my research that synthetic urine is what they use to calibrate the urinalysis machine, so there&#039;s no way to fail, as long as you can get the right temp in the cup without getting caught.<br /><br />This is all assuming your drug test is going to be a pee test though.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of them taking a swab of saliva from your cheek, too. Hopefully I never run into that...<br /><br />

				I definitely agree that there are easier ways to past the test, if you do your research you can find all the ingredients in the detox drinks and make your own for bout 20$. As for your jell and water method. I heard of it bout 5-7 years ago. <br /><br />When was the last time you used this method, and what type of piss test was it? The newer more advance test can spot simple dilution like that. I know for a fact that if ur taking a piss test for anything thats important enough, they will send ur sample to a lab to check for creatine, specific gravity, and ph levels. <br /><br />If your creatine, specific gravity or ph levels are off, they can&#039;t fail you, but if its for pre employment they definitely have the right to say we wont higher you. They sometime will also call you in at random for another piss test or they wont tell you that you need to piss again, then make you pee on the spot So me I would rather drop 40 for some quick fix, which will pass any test.<br /><br />in the end it depends how important it is for you to pass the test, and what type of test they&#039;re giving you. like i said before 40 to 60 bucks is well worth that high paying low work cozy job, or to stay out of jail.

Don&#039;t rely on that info but it&#039;s what I read and worked for me. Should look it up. I&#039;m pretty sure it only picks up on shit currently in your saliva/mouth. I smoked 4 days before getting one brushed my teeth a lot on the days before and then passed it. Honestly I&#039;d rather deal with saliva than piss any day.
