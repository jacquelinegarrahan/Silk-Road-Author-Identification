				I&#039;m new to this whole silk road thing and I must say it&#039;s a breath of fresh air as my local trip dealer got busted as they say. So....<br /><br />To save those extra helpful people a bit of time writing out very long tutorials on how to get bitcoins, I&#039;m looking for the absolute fastest and simplest way. I&#039;m currently waiting on MTGOX to verify and then I will be waiting on bank transfers etc. Is there any way I can just get straight into it before all this happens, i.e. be buying from SR this evening?<br /><br />

				There are lots of coin vendors on SR but you can&#039;t buy direct from SR as far as I know. Of course there is always the risk of getting scammed if you buy from an unknown so you need to be really careful

				In terms of quickest/easiest it&#039;s:&nbsp; bitinstant.com -- &gt; CVS (red-phone)--&gt; Coins in are in MtGox account in 20 min.&nbsp; <br /><br />Easiest definitely does not mean best though. Having to drive somewhere out of the way, 500 limit/day, 4% fee, etc, can get annoying pretty fast.<br /><br />I wish I could find an easier way myself, without the hassles of&nbsp; fees and a transaction limit.

				If it&#039;s relatively easy for you to get to a Bank of America during normal business hours anytime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, &amp;/or Fridays, then I&#039;d HIGHLY recommend at the very least checking out Blue Sky Traders: http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm<br /><br />I can promise you based off of my own personal experience that they&#039;re completely &amp;entirely legitamite, &amp; are as professional &amp; speedy as they say they are.

				As mentioned above, Mt.Gox is pretty fast :D<br />A lot too has to attributed to how fast the BTC currency is too. If it&#039;s a slow day, be prepaid to wait a few hours for transaction confirmations :D<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
