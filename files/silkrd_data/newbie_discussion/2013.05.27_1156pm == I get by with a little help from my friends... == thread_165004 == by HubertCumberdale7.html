				I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m about to do this but...here it goes. <br />I made the poor decision of FE&#039;ing for SamGiancana - and lost 6 BitCoins...<br />After I realized I had been totally fucked, I decided that...indeed some people are just useless. <br />I then made an order with ImportConnections for another 5 BitCoins based on reviews and 100% satisfaction rating...I knew he was a newer vendor, but given high ratings...everyone has to start somewhere right? Wrong. At this point, I&#039;m literally afraid I might not be able to pay my rent or my bills...<br /><br />If anyone is willing or able to send even small amounts of bitcoins to help me out...I&#039;d be forever grateful. I&#039;ll also be on the lookout for some trustworthy vendors to help get some business going. My luck with the Silk Road has been unbelievably poor...I really need to know that there are some decent people still left out there. <br /><br />Thank you and bless you to anyone who can help.<br /><br />1PrPB782DWjMAPP2i9VLzszToiY8wmVi6y

				Don&#039;t FE if you can&#039;t afford to lose the coin.&nbsp; Even established big time guys have cut and run at times.

				I had a momentary lapse of reason. I should&#039;ve definitely known better than to trust someone on the internet...not that some of you aren&#039;t good people...but not with that kinda scrap when I don&#039;t have spare. <br /><br />I&#039;ll make it through, I&#039;m sure. Good vibes.
