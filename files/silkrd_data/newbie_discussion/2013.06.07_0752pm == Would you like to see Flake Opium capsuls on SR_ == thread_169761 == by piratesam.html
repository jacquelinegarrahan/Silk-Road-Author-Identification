				Ok, so basically Flake Opium is the end result of boiling and filtering opium pods and the seeds. You &quot;Bake&quot; it, then you dry it, it turns into little brown flakes, almost like a less powdery brown tinted crack. It has a very weak high when smoked, however when it is consumed through tabs or capsules it is extremely potent. I have other methods of further processing it to make it more potent however I won&#039;t give it away, you know.. secret recipe. So it&#039;s kinda like cocaine except without the gasoline and ammonia and what not, and instead of coca leaf it&#039;s opium.&nbsp;

				i think i made some 0f this from poppy seeds. like post above this one said<br />got a couple pounds seeds soaked in water and pressed a few times<br />then boiled down the water and got a brown thick goo then made into a ball and dried.<br />i still have some here.<br />not that good.<br />seeds must have been over washed by seed supplier.<br />sometimes its better than others.<br />but not really worth the effort unless you have nothing to do at all.<br />

				Poppies are not like marijuana.&nbsp; They have to be planted early in the season (february) or in the fall before february.&nbsp; Then as the days get longer the poppies shoot up and flower, then form pods.&nbsp; This happens only in late spring and early summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Poppies cannot be grown (unlike marijuana) at any time of the year.&nbsp; Plus harvesting opium from poppies is difficult.&nbsp; Each pod produces a small amount of sap.&nbsp; &nbsp;To get a gram of opium you need many plants.&nbsp; I&#039;ve grown poppies and harvested very small amounts of opium.&nbsp; It was fun, and poppies are beautiful plants.

				Opium is opium. If CFO (cooked flake opium) is done right, you won&#039;t be able to tell a difference unless you are using analytical equipment or are a hard-core opium connoisseur (and I mean daily for years hard-core). The trick is in how well it&#039;s made. Likely the CFO that the OP is talking about is poorly made because it doesn&#039;t smoke well. This is because pods contain various molecular sized contaminates that don&#039;t effect the high when eating, but they don&#039;t vaporize properly (they will actually burn before the opium vaporizes) and will give you a nasty smoke with a small high (since you can&#039;t get it hot enough to vaporize the opium). Once upon a time I made some high quality CFO, but it took a lot of care and time (note, I have a BS in chemical engineering and access to a fully stocked lab) and you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell the difference - other than CFO is flaky and almost completely dry while regular opium has some moisture to it. The relative strength of smoking vs eating was the same as any other opiate - meaning that there weren&#039;t enough contaminates to mess up the smoking process.<br /><br />Long story short, opium is opium, regardless of what you start with. You just have to process and purify it differently depending on what your starting materials are.<br /><br />Also, putting it in capsules just makes it easier to take orally, assuming the OP uses generic geletan 00 capsules, you can always break it open and smoke up what&#039;s inside.
