				Okay, I need to come to the community for some help. Im using this new account for this purpose, I&#039;ve searched and read threads about successfuly receiving orders... but not much distinction was made in those threads about domestic/intl, useing real name/fake name.<br /><br />I have placed a few successful orders to my house, &lt;5 total. All order&#039;s have been adressed to myelf to my own residence. I have ordered nothing nothing larger than an 1/8th of M. The frequency has been about an order every 15 days, but its been 30~ days since my last order. Each order I have placed is domestic and tracked. All receivd without a hitch.<br /><br />Now, heres the kicker, I am about to place myself a 10-20g order of M. It will be domestic and untracked. Needles to say its racked my nerves up a bit.<br /><br />It was my intention to initially send this order to a friends house. I wanted to send to my friends place because, Im nervous about the frequency I have sent to my own name and adresss&nbsp; and that its a bit of a larger order. This other person has nothing related to SR/Tor going on however there is a bit of a paper trail between us (sms) that refers to the idea. So, I don&#039;t know what to do.<br /><br /><br />I guess I am just looking for some feedback, should I be worried at all about this order? all feedback from vendor is positive, not one person has not received their domestic regular mail (untracked package), I am lead to believe the stealth is working well...&nbsp; well I guess do know the packages are coming 2x/3x vac&#039;ed sealed.<br /><br /><br />In terms of legality, Im more ready to have the fuzz hit me than my friend. I also feel, from reading the forum, that I am more prepared should that happen.<br /><br />SO folks, what do you thinks?

				As long as the orders you&#039;ve received thus far were all properly packaged and not sketchy looking and you haven&#039;t been busted doing anything else that&#039;s illegal, you should be fine to receive this package. Spacing out your orders by two weeks (and a month in this case) isn&#039;t going to draw any negative attention to yourself unless you&#039;re receiving terribly packaged gear or the cops are already onto you for something else.

				i&#039;ve thoguth about this alot too, onlly made small orders but would a big one be much differant?<br /><br />as long as packing is good I think not, but i know if I made a big order i&#039;d be shitting it until it arrived, and then still for a bit until i wa sure i wasnt getting a knock at the door.<br /><br />I get a few packages every week from ebay, so i tend to imagine that the postman just assumes thats what it is all the time...

It&#039;s always scary receiving your first big order, but you can lessen some of those fears by doing extensive research and finding a vendor with exceptional packaging and a very low no show rate.

				10-20 grams is in the neighborhood of half an ounce.&nbsp; If their stealth is excellent I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be over concerned about amounts less than one ounce.&nbsp; More than that is different territory, IMHO.&nbsp; If caught you can make arguments about personal use, etc etc but once you get over an ounce that&#039;s hard to justify.

If you share some of your gram of MDMA, I believe in Canada, that alone can be considered traffic/distribution. Maybe I&#039;m way out in left though here..&nbsp; ???

				accepting any package that has illegal contents is a problem for you&nbsp; duh. however if you have already received packages to your place then dont change. change will mess up your system. nobody knows what you doing. stop doing so many drugs. just follow the vendors requests from their home page. your as safe as you wanna be. loose lips sink ships.&nbsp; tell no one of your activities. eventually someone gonna want your shit for themselves and they will watch your mailbox for packages and snag them before you can. then you pay for them to party. and you get nothin. if you want extra stealth then youll have to pay for it. most vendors will work with you. but most are very good at their stealth. good luck.
