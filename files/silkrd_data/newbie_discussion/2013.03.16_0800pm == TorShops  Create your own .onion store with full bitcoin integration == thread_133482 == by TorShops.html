				Tell others about this TorShops, and earn 25% from every purchase they will make. Simply give them this link:<br /><br />http://shopsat2dotfotbs.onion/?ref=YOURUSERNAME<br /><br />Replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual username on this site and get earnings directly to your wallet.<br /><br />Additionaly to the 25% refferal commission, you will earn 0.5-1% (depending on volume) of ALL sales the vendor makes with his new shop!<br /><br />Get some bigger Silkroad seller to buy a shop and earn 100s or 1000s of USD!<br /><br />Alternatively to giving them this link you can just tell them to send us a message with your username at shopsat2dotfotbs.onion so we know which account to pay the commission to.

				Why we made TorShops:<br /><br />We think SR is a great market, but might not be able to handle the growth its getting.<br />So instead of creating yet another marketplace like BMR or Atlantis etc we decided to go a more decentralized way.<br />Every vendor will get his own .onion address, so we can move large traffic sites to their own servers, which will scale alot better than a single marketplace .onion<br />

				We often get questions about why sellers should trust us, thats of course not easy to answer. We are running TorLinks (http://torlinkbgs6aabns.onion/) since about a year, and spent the last 12 month coding and making design templates for TorShops.<br />So you can be assured this is not just a quick scam trying to collect a few Bitcoins.<br />We have invested too much work for this, so expect TorShops to exist as long as people trade things for Bitcoins&nbsp; :D<br />

				With TorShops sellers will also get alot more traffic from google since shops will be indexed through onion.to and onion.sh etc<br />Just think about all the traffic dutchgreenclub or budmail is getting.<br /><br />If you can handle large amount of sales you could become one of the biggest shops on the internet because of our referral system, it will give you alot of advertising, basically like dutchgreenclubs invite codes.<br />

				I was interested in purchasing something from one of those shops which shall remain nameless for now. So I made an account. When I got in, there was a notice from admin that no questions would be answered until you buy something. What? How can I buy some generic thing with an inadequate description without photos that does not tell where they will ship to? So then I find TorShops forum and its the same deal. I could not find anywhere I was permitted to post to ask a question. So! Unless this changes, I personally will not be using TorShops.

				so anyone can set up a shop?<br /><br />how do we know whether they are a scammer if there if no verifiable feedback system? - this even happens on SR occasionally, but at least there are mods around who can ban someone, and an escrow system.<br /><br />mark me as dubious. Am open to be corrected, and no wish to rain on your parade torshops, but I am sure you can understand my concerns - can you reassure me?
