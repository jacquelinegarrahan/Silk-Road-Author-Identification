				I&#039;d like to see this &#039;proof&#039;, maybe not publicly.<br />Often people think that just vague proof that could imply something is enough, do you have real physical proof of everything, which they in return can verify is real or not?<br /><br />Of course, you could be right as well. Guess I&#039;ll never know.<br />Well, have a nice day anyways, forgot what we we&#039;re talking about.

				I don&#039;t know the details, but I&#039;m going to guess a common &#039;complaint&#039; where the buyer swears s/he is right is where the buyer claims s/he never received the product, while the vendor has a DCN showing it was delivered.

				So. You accuse a vendor of selling fake drugs. You don&#039;t like the drugs, you don&#039;t think they&#039;re what you paid for.<br /><br />The vendor offers you 33% refund (not bad IMO)<br /><br />You then promise never to tell a soul if the vendor just owns up to the fact that he sold something under a false label.<br /><br />I can see where you are coming from, but you are never going to get a top vendor, or any vendor worth their salt, to admit they are selling anything other than what they state they are selling. It is incredibly naive of you to think otherwise, even if you did promise.<br /><br />As far as I can see, vendors threatening and blackmailing buyers with knowledge of their addresses etc is old hat and an easy way to pressure a buyer into putting 5/5 feedback. Yes it is wrong, and yes I think SR should do something about it but in reality what can they do? They have a top vendor vs you, a single Silk Road punter.<br /><br /><br />You say escrow was useless. Did you FE? Did you finalise before testing the product? If so more fool you. Escrow does work if used properly.<br /><br />I feel for you man, it&#039;s horrible thinking you have been ripped off, however I would accept the 33% and learn a lesson. Never finalise until you are happy with your product.

				Well, one thing&#039;s for sure and that&#039;s that I&#039;m never using SuperTrips. I had actually contemplated buying from them previously. The threat may or may not be real (I&#039;m not doubting you stenak, I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s no way to prove that that was the note sent by ST), but they seem to have a very unprofessional and careless demeanor towards the health and safety of their customers.<br /><br />Thank you stenak for bringing this out in public despite the hostility you face by doing so!

Once stenak provided proof and showed the nonchalant way in which the vendor essentially communicated their &quot;most of my customers are too dumb to realize, so I don&#039;t care&quot; approach no one really appeared to even flinch. I think it is of utmost importance that we all work together to make sure this place is safe for everyone, as that is the only way we can keep the road as safe as possible. We must hold irresponsible vendors accountable for their actions, and I applaud stenak for bringing this information out there despite being new to the community.<br /><br />I&#039;m also sorry this happened to you, stenak, and wish you better success in the future.<br />

I do think we only have one side of the story though, and it would be nice if SuperTrips could show up here and give their side of the story too.

So one must rephrase that into Sternak accuses ST selling a different product known for it&#039;s toxicity cut with lactose, he doesn&#039;t think he got what he paid for. <br />I never bought or investigated heroin before, I happen to know, because I shut up someone with the exact same claim regarding the same vendor and product. Btw, I will apologize and edit my post over there later on. It doesn&#039;t compare at all to getting weak ass coke.

Top 1%, there is no concrete evidence whether he kept that address or not. It is &quot;just&quot; a threat. They have a concession ST deliberately sells a different product, but that not in the category &quot;things to avoid&quot;. They won&#039;t do shit and continue to cash in, as usual. They would take immediate action if he did sell that junk out of escrow though, as it happened to Frank Mathews. The greatest wrongdoing of a vendor is not to provide the cut.

				Yeah man, I&#039;d never order from SuperTrips. If you look through the reviews carefully, even though people are leaving 5/5 they explain how they were unsatisfied with the customer service and shipping times etc. etc....<br />He is a pro selective scammer. He obviously blackmails his customers as well. It&#039;s a shame that SR is allowing this type of conduct to go on. Sooner or later some real shit is going to go down if SR doesn&#039;t step up it&#039;s game.

You&#039;ll not get as high as you wanted, the taste sucks and it burns your throat a little, no. He sells some really nasty and dangerous shit here, yet refund claims are made individually.<br />And ST knows how to play the system: <br />- threats made in privnote = not SR = not legit.<br />- surely as the threatening happens out of SR, the fear for retaliation feels less legit?&nbsp; Screenshots? Doesn&#039;t prove shit. And I agree they can be faked. <br />- 5/5 feedback + blank comments extorted in favor of a 30% refund getting poison at your door.&nbsp; And you should deem yourself happy about it?<br />And the system plays along..<br /><br />Chew on it.

				I feel for you, but in all honesty, what do you expect? If any idiot junky could just log into SR and claim their product was crap and get a full refund, do you actually think this site would work? No it wouldn&#039;t. This is the internet, whether it is a drug dealer or a nerd on a WoW forum, if you call them out on something or try to create confrontation, they&#039;re going to respond in a similar way as ST did. I&#039;ve sold stuff to people and I know for a fact it was legit, yet they claimed it was fake. Do you think they got any sympathy from me? hell no, I don&#039;t play your junky fucking games, gtfo and buy from someone else then. It is just how the drug trade game works, and as a dealer or vendor, you have to be the aggressor or you get exploited, simple as that. <br /><br />

				This should be posted in the rumor section. only newbies are on this page.<br />Fuck supertrips. this post pissed me off. the threats, the deception, the arrogance. And this is not the first time i&#039;m hearing of this ass clowns fake dope. <br />If SR support wont help him, as a community we should. report his page with a link to this page and say you are outraged.<br />second, BOYCOTT SuperTrips! And any domestic reseller he uses.<br />The the OP, Good job!

It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t understand the profit of doing such, it is just that I consider doing a thing as that counterproductive in the long run, and completely suicidal (unless your plan is to get as much money as you can and then leave the scene with neither a goodbye). <br /><br />Sure, you as the staff get your share of money from scammers, fine, but if people start to understand this (it&#039;s impossible to keep something concealed for long under the sun), how much time do you think it will take before people begin to go looking elsewhere? It doesn&#039;t exist an indestructible empire (it never happened and it will never happen), and an empire that&#039;s based on market laws stands upon the legitimacy of the sames. If the reputation of the market goes sour it will take just a little moment to have the solid cement on which your palace&#039;s basis is built turn into quicksand, and when it does, everything will collapse of consequence as a domino. <br /><br />I understand not wanting to actually ban a long standing vendor or banning it only on the most heavy circumstances and proofs, but the staff could at last refund the OP fully and warn the vendor (publicly if possible) that a thing as the one shown in the messages it is not admissible. Doing nothing on a so blatant break of SR rules (the market rules) is NOT a way to ensure you will have a good business and profit in the long run: it is just a very short-sighted way to earn profit, and I think everybody can understand how profitable it is to ask people to follow your lead when you are considered blind, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Just for this I would personally like an admin (as Libertas, that&#039;s also here sometimes) to bring some light on the issue, so as to know what really happened there and why a decision of doing nothing on the issue was taken given the obvious fraudulent and blackmailing intent as CLEARLY evidenced from the messages of the same vendor&#039;s account&nbsp; (that the admin surely looked upon, isn&#039;t it?).

				I guess all in all you can count this as a lesson learned. Don&#039;t FE and don&#039;t release funds until you test your product. I don&#039;t really think that the threat would hold any ground, I mean, what is the seller going to do? Come to your place? I would love for a seller to threaten me and try to come to my house, I have an armory in here. The seller wouldn&#039;t report you, that would be one of the most ignorant things a seller could do, tracking numbers and all. <br /><br />If it was me, I would just blast the seller all over the forum. Not sure if the seller has the ability to withhold feedback from their page, but if they don&#039;t, go edit your feedback on their page, make it long and drawn out. I thankfully haven&#039;t had to deal with this sort of thing, but then again I check and recheck a sellers feedback and anything that might be on the forums that is said about them, if I find anything negative that I don&#039;t like, I find someone else. <br /><br />Personally if it was me and I was offered the 33% I would probably take it, and chalk it up as a loss.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				Sadly it&#039;s going to take way more than a handful of disgruntled heroin users to take a guy like SuperTrips down a notch.&nbsp; Still, it&#039;s better than the street yeah?<br /><br />All you can do is make sure everyone knows what you think of his stuff so ppl can make an educated choice when buying his stuff. At the end of the day a lot of ppl just want to get off. They&#039;re not regular users, can&#039;t tell the difference between real Heroin and fake shit and they are happy with their stone.<br /><br />If you want good #4 then Frank Matthews is hot atm.

				I agree with Stanek.<br />Someone from SR should be on here making their views known - stanek has a genuine greivance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Threatening someone with being outed to the cops is also a no-no in any illegal dealings so this vendor should at least be given an official warning.<br /><br /><br />

Calling it. +1 to you.<br /><br />Privnote is no proof.<br />They caught FM proposing out of escrow transaction, it was called before it took place. Next day he was gone. Temporarily suspended. Maybe he did out of escrow transaction we&#039;ll never know. <br />&nbsp;Points being:<br />1. Offenses related to untaxed cash flow see immediate action without any proof neither, let&#039;s say any we know or heard of, at least. <br />2. For the rest, anything goes. Selective scamming, fraudulent products (could add dangerous), intimidation, extortion. <br /><br />Peace out. <br />Jason<br /><br /><br />

It offers buyers and sellers a platform for trades, and escrow for those transaction. It&#039;s owners interest is to have a high volume of exchanges, be it volume or value.&nbsp; <br /><br />The main benefit for the buyer is to have acces to a large variety of high grades products, the sellers benefits are to remain anonymous. <br />The main drawback or benefit, depending on your willigness to utilize violence as a mean, is that both are forced to settle their problems under scrutinity of SR admins who ultimately decide of the outcome, their interest being stated above. <br /><br />Then, this thread is about stenak having played by SR rules, which fucked him, ultimatly, whereas IRL he wouldn&#039;t have bought what he got knowingly. The &#039;resolution&#039; would have been different too, it bet. <br /><br />Peace out.<br />Jason.

It&#039;s not like there&#039;s a quality control process being followed. Posts here in the forum and feedback are all people have to go by. In my experience with bud, most people do not know what good bud is until you provide them with it and once they get the good stuff they are hard to please after that. We need as many reviews of vendors and products as we can get, but people are lazy and don&#039;t want to be bothered. Buyers are sort of intimidated to leave 5/5 as well, especially if you want to continue to do business on that account.

				Wow do I feel stupid&nbsp; &gt;:( I didn&#039;t read this thread before ordering his crap I read a complaint from 1 guy on another thread email ST and gave him the benefit of his feedback I now own a bad of Fentanyl .<br />Ironically I have more than 20 F patches I can not use because of a allergy .<br /><br />I had placed a order with Frank had to cancel so I just ordered in hopes I would get the same type of #4 .<br />I have run 2 tests on the crap I was sent both are negative for opiates .<br /><br />I did not FE I will post outcome ST is saying this crap is H#4 its like baking soda with a slight bitter taste , if you look at what ST specializes in its domestic chemicals obviously he is slinging some crap they are producing in a lab .<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this guy <br /><br />GF

As been stated before, you won&#039;t get shit from RC admins if you had an issue with ST, as this guy is being SR golden goose. Do a little research and you&#039;ll see that this episode is not unique.<br /><br />If you could back up your claims with some tests, you&#039;d build a stronger case. The thing is, SR doesn&#039;t necessarily consider uploaded pics as proof, as they can be faked, nor any out of SR conversation.<br /><br />So you can start a resolution, but you should consider yourself lucky if you got a 50% refund.<br /><br />Peace out<br />Jason Bourne<br /><br />
