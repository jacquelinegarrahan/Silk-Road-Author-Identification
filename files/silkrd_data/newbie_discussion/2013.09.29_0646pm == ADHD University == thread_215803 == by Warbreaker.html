				I was about to buy 100 Addies off ADHD University and he wanted me to FE so I didn&#039;t order the large order, however I did order 5 from him before. He said he&#039;s got 100 guns + 100 clips he&#039;s going to bring to my house if I don&#039;t buy the 100 addies. What the fuck does this mean?

				If I was to guess, he&#039;s either joking or is a complete donk by the sounds of him! If I was in your shoes i&#039;d say, in the most polite way possible &quot;GO FUCK YOURSELF&quot;.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get someone with a bit better manners that&#039;ll be glad to sort ya out.... Wouldn&#039;t even reply to that other donk as he only has 40 transactions and obviously thinks he has easy money by scaring you into buying.<br /><br />Look at his most recent review too man. DONT FE WITH THAT DICK!!<br /><br />That&#039;s just my opinion though.

The odds of some piece of shit tracking you down to cap you for not buying his product on the SR are incredibly low. Think about what kind of an idiot you would have to be to do this.
