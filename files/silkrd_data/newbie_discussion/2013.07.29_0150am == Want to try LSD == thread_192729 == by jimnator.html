				Hello, I would like to try LSD. There&#039;s a big festival coming this weekend around here and I bought 50 tabs of lsd from hollandonline.<br /><br />I did magic mushrooms before on an empty stomach, and it was my worst experience. I got totally out of control and I had a bad trip overall, I felt sick and out of control, I had a panic attack, I&#039;m somewhat insecure if I&#039;m not in control of myself.<br /><br />What about LSD, would I enjoy that? Does it get you totally out of control if I do 1/2 tab? I just wanna feel good and have amazing thoughts and enjoy the show ofc.

				Different drugs affect different people differently. Maybe not a very helpful statement, but very true.<br /><br />There is no way to tell what 1/2 a tab will do to you without prior experience. Personally I would say it&#039;s unlikely you will get &quot;out of control&quot; on a half tab unless you have no psychedelic experience and/or extreme sensitivity. I don&#039;t know what the dosage you order is like but a standard hit of acid is about 100ug. 50ug is a pretty light dose in my opinion. 100ug is usually a fine place for beginner to start. Not nearly enough for some people however.<br /><br />My advice is you can always take more, but you can&#039;t take less after you&#039;ve taken it. Start slow, explore.

				Lsd imo is a much stronger psych, partly just because its atleast twice as long as mushies. Lsd also tends to &quot;bring the skeletons out of the closet&quot; as my friend has said. Some people can eat lsd and some people cant wont know till you try but start with a low dose and see how it goes from there. Lsd is beautiful and life changing so always remember to treat it with respect!

				Take a Xanax XR with your LSD. It has a calming effect that reduces the freakouts.<br /><br />Either that or simply don&#039;t do it. Try Peyote instead. (Navaho V way ceremony)

				If you are going to do it like someone else said bring some xanax. Always good to have landing gear especially when your a noob or eating L with noobs. That festival i was at i brought L then proceeded to buy 10 xanax after my GF decided to eat L if that tells you anything :P!<br /><br />Also since i go to alot of festivals becareful there are more RCs and bunk blotters than ever out there.

				Some people like to take recreational amounts (up to 120ug?) when going out partying, but I prefer to be somewhere quiet when tripping, well away from crowds and possible sources of confusion. LSD and psilocybin have similar effects, though your feeling sick was probably just your stomach&#039;s reaction to the shrooms. So my advice for this festival is that you take some Ecstacy with one or more friends. If it&#039;s high quality and you don&#039;t take too little or too much than you&#039;re far more likely to have an enjoyable time.

				say for instance if i brought 25 or 50 tabs to an event and it was high grade L from off here....&nbsp; would it be possible to sell them at 25 to 30 a tab considering people mass produce and sell nbomes?

				My experience with Psychedelics has always been affected by set and setting. Make sure you&#039;re with good people and you&#039;re happy with life as it is. Start off with a low dose (90-100ug) and up it if you&#039;re feeling confident.
