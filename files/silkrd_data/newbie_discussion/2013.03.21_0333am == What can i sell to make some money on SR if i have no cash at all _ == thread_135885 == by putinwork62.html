				You could sell drugs yu get off SR.&nbsp; Take people&#039;s money and place an order for them without letting them know how it&#039;s done.&nbsp; &nbsp;Access to any drug? High quality ? Delivered to any address? just resell it for a bit of a markup.&nbsp; You can find some deals .&nbsp; One you save up enough cash, you can start buying bulk and keeping some in stock /on hand.<br /><br />And if that don&#039;t work, there is always that purdy mouth ya gots there boy!<br /><br />The road is a great resource.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)

However I started off with LSD cause the price and quality on here + its easy to get through customs as dogs cant smell it. You will need to invest a bit of coin to start off with but I recently quit my job due to the same reason and im making a Fuck-Tonne of cash using SR and selling locally. Started with $800 and got my money back x6 when the product arrived xD

				You are welcome :).&nbsp; That sounds good brother.&nbsp; It&#039;s easiest to get started with pre-made spore syringes.&nbsp; But as you get into it, you will probably want to make your own.&nbsp; This keeps costs down even more, and it&#039;s cool finding people online who are into trading spore prints, so you can try your hand at growing many different species and pick the best ones.
