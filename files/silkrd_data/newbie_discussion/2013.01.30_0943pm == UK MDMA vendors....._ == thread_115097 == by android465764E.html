				Symbiosis has been great for me, good prices as well :<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bc83b70f3e <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t always have stock though, so have to be quick when he does.<br /><br />JesusOfRaves can be great as well if he has stock.<br /><br />Both great for communication and shipping.

				Ha, I was saving this question you for you Android!<br /><br />Well I&#039;ve bitten the bullet (or maybe just got a little over-eager) and have attempted to buy single gram of MDMA crystals from 4sale, mainly as the stuff looks so good in the photo (but his ranking and reviews are also good), but stopped when I realised he charged postage at £5.&nbsp; £5 for a letter in the UK?&nbsp; How can that be?<br /><br />I am still a bit miffed that Budworx UK&#039;s page said he didn&#039;t charge postage when a postage charge was added at checkout, so I&#039;ve decided to give 4Sale a miss for now and have a another crawl around later (and it is a crawl...)<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;d ask him about it in his thread if I was able. A private message seems somehow too direct (and private).<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe I have to write fifty very slow posts of crap......<br /><br />Night, night
