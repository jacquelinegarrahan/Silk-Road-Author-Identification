				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/76878a3061<br /><br />So this was my second order on SR and i was kinda nervous since it was more money than the first one. No need to be nervous at all though, package was marked in transit on July 4th and was here on the 9th, just 3 business days to Eastern Europe :) Stealth was good, double vacuum seal as told in the description, didn&#039;t have a scale to weight it but it felt right. The hash was good, smoked most of it in joints with tobacco, and some of it the pin way (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC1Gy9he79I). It had a nice, mellow head buzz that lasted quite long, almost as much as weed buzz lasts for me, which no other hash i&#039;ve smoked thus far has achieved. The quality to money ratio is great with this product and i&#039;ll surely reorder soon :)

				This is the first hashish order I&#039;ve made on the SR, and I have to say I was very happy. &#039;Emerald&#039;s communication is excellent and he seems very straightforward, with letting me know exactly when it was dispatched and when to expect the product. <br /><br />The hash itself is very, very nice. It looks a little different to the advertised picture, but it the quality is better than I expected. Its very soft and almost a little sticky, difficult to form into a ball though. The smell of the product made me realize that this was the real deal, a strong classic hash smell with and underlying spicyness that just reeks of quality. <br /><br />The smoke... well this is the best part. The taste is very well-rounded and amongst some of the best I have smoked in almost 15 years of smoking cannabis. It&#039;s taste and smell off the joint reminds me of the &#039;Morrocan Shoe Hash&#039; I tried some years ago in Amsterdam. The high is excellent: starting off quite buzzy and &#039;head high&#039; it slowly creeps over your whole body leaving you feel warm and comfortable. Normally I would give this hash 9/10... but for the price and the general decency of Emerald it simply has to be 10/10. <br /><br />I will be back with a more substantial order in a few weeks. Peace
