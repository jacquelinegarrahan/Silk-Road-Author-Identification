				&nbsp;&gt;:( My first buy on SR and I get shafted.....after looking at this guys stats I was very confident in making my first purchase..... However even though he got back to right away at first ( the sale where i purchased tracking and express shipping) He has yet to respond and now hes just not sending anyones orders and still asking people to FE. Beware ...I thought i was safe ordering domestic and having a seller with great stats.... hopefully my second purchase on SR will go smoothly.

				He just deleted his forum account and removed his listings, so I&#039;m guessing he&#039;s gone.

				Damn, that sucks and its crazy how quick it happened...<br /><br />I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot; but seriously though maybe you should look at it like this, he could have just as easily disappeared because he got arrested and is currently between you and some charges. Idk maybe give it some time but just never ever FE even the best vendor can go scam eventually.

				Don&#039;t tell me he has pulled a runner as well, I sampled his MDMA when he first started and he really did seem like a decent vendor.

				I never would of FE&#039;d other than the fact I have done business with him in the past, including FE&#039;ing a few orders.....then he came back and I thought I&#039;d give his H a try for a few grams, told me several excuses that his guys forgot to get it out and he gave me extra product to make up for the wait. then when I called him out on it, refused to answer any messages.

				Sorry that happened to you, it seems some vendors just can&#039;t help but take advantage of FE and pull a runner, even after being quite decent in the past.

				This happens all too often I&#039;m afraid which is why the FE issue will just rumble on. Any vendor looking to pull an exit FE scam will invariably have a customer base who have been happy with the service they have received in the past. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security and if you absolutely must FE then only gamble what you can afford to lose. <br /><br />Sorry for anyone who just got burnt&nbsp; :-\<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Very sorry to hear that. :( My first purchase was a single tab of LSD for sampling purposes from him and I FE&#039;d as a brand new user (of course, losing $10 isn&#039;t a big deal and he had good stats).&nbsp; Just don&#039;t buy from vendors who require FE unless you actually don&#039;t care if you lose the $.&nbsp; I&#039;m really surprised he went rogue like that though--communication with him was excellent.&nbsp;
