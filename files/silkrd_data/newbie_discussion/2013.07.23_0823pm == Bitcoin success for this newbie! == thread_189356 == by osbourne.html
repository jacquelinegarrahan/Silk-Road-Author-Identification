				After some lengthy (and tedious) forum searching and review scanning, I purchased $200 of bitcoins from cashintocoins.com.&nbsp; I shot the site a email last night and got a quick response from Will with the needed deposit information.&nbsp; In the morning, I drove to Wells Fargo to deposit my $ into the account number provided.&nbsp; I had to provide NO ID of any sort.&nbsp; Made the deposit and got my receipt.&nbsp; I emailed Will back with a picture of my receipt and received an email from him about an hour later saying there was trouble with the transfer.&nbsp; I went to blockchain site and it was down for maintenance.&nbsp; I replied back to Will&#039;s email explaining the site was down.&nbsp; Once the site was back up, I created a new address on blockchain and asked him to try to deposit again.&nbsp; In less than 1 hour, my coins were transferred.&nbsp; Then, I transferred the coins from blockchain to my SR account.&nbsp; After staring at my SR account for 20 minutes and seeing no coins, I left it alone.&nbsp; Checked it 3 hours later and the coins were in my SR account and I placed my first order!!!&nbsp; Finally!!&nbsp; Now, more waiting for a package :o

				I found out about cashintocoins.com from this forum, sorry don&#039;t have a link to the forum posting.<br /><br />The ewallet I transferred it to was blockchain.info.&nbsp; Another plus is he charges 4% fee, a relatively good price.

				Find a site that accepts money orders.&nbsp; The fee is $1.50, as opposed to the $30+ for a bank/wire transfer.

				I can understand everyone&#039;s urge to stay anonymous but I see no problem with using coinbase.... its usually significant cheaper and if you plan ahead a four day wait isnt that big of a deal. <br /><br />On that note for my last purchase I didn&#039;t plan ahead and was looking for something quick landed on money2btc.com. STAY AWAY! They advertise that youll get btc instantly, this is false for your first purchase there&#039;s a 3 day wait period which isnt an issue but it should be advertised. Further more after 5 not three days I was told that my transaction couldn&#039;t be processed and that i would have my money back in my bank account in 7 business days... that was 20 days ago. Not claiming scam as I&#039;ve emailed them and said to be working on it but a bigger hassle than I want to deal with and I&#039;m sure most would feel the same.

				Cashintocoins worked perfectly for me, except they are often out of bitcoins.&nbsp; Then i discovered coinbase and after hesitantly giving them my bank account info I found that they are amazing and I see no reason to go back to bitinstant.&nbsp; But if you are sketched by the linking of a bank account, cashintocoins.com has fantastic customer service and is fast and anonymous.&nbsp; Localbitcoins also works well but I find the other 2 websites to be easier.
