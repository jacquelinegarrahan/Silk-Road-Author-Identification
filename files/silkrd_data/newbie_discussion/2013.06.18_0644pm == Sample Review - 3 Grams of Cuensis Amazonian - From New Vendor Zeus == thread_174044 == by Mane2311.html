				OK. So first off, massive apologies to Zeus for taking so long to getting round to writing this review. And a massive thanks for being one of the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; and receiving a very generous sample of 3 (3.1 to be exact) grams of dried, powdered Cubensis Amazonian shrooms for just $1 postage! :D <br /><br />Please excuse me if I leave out anything important, I&#039;ve never written a product review or trip report before.<br /><br />COMMUNICATION - 5/5<br /><br />Zeus had great prompt and polite communication throughout. No problems here :) <br /><br />DELIVERY TIME - 5/5<br /><br />Germany -&gt; UK. Pretty quick. No complaints :)<br /><br />PACKAGING AND STEALTH - 4/5<br /><br />Packaging and stealth was excellent; double vacuum sealed, so I even found it hard to get into and it was well hidden in the envelope between paper. <br /><br />My only reason for giving less than 5/5 here is because the envelope had printed on the front the return/senders name and address. This was also printed on paper inside the envelope. <br /><br />I would obviously highly recommend to new vendors not to do this as obviously the receiver can deny knowledge of the package contents whereas the sender can&#039;t! I&#039;ve subsequently received other packages from the E.U. which also have this. Is it a postage requirement there or something?? Even if it&#039;s a fake name and address I&#039;d recommend not doing this if at all possible. <br /><br />PRODUCT - 5/5<br /><br />As I said I&#039;ve never written a trip report before and tend to take them with a pinch-of-salt because i believe that who you are can have almost as much effect on how you feel as the substance you ingest, but anyway here you go: Overall they were great. I have a reasonably amount of experience with hallucinogens, but not a great deal with mushrooms. So I originally started of with about 1.6-1.8g sprinkled on a pizza (not baked on, just fresh on top of pre-made one I cooked) and then topped up just eating more of them throughout the afternoon. <br />As it was going to be a nice sunny day ,the plan was to go to a local park and drink and smoke spliffs with some friends. In the end the weather wasn&#039;t quite as good as I&#039;d hoped and I ended up hanging out with some people I didn&#039;t know too well but this wasn&#039;t a problem. I was all smiles and plenty of spliffs were smoked and beers drunk ;) <br />I had a wonderful afternoon. Very nice floaty, full-body feeling you get with proper more &quot;traditional&quot; trips like acid (as oposed to RCs). Visually very nice, my favourite part being the beautiful trails that followed everything around, like the birds flying across the park.<br />So overall I had a great time. Thanks again Zeus I&#039;ll def be back when I was some more shrooms :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll obviously send Zeus a link to this thread now so he can post it in the official product review thread.
