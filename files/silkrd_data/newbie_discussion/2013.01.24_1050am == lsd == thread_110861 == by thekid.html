				3-4 grams of MDMA in one night?&nbsp; That&#039;s ridiculous.&nbsp; Gotta take care of your brain, buddy, it&#039;s the only one you&#039;ve got this lifetime.<br /><br />Either way, LSD is very different to MDMA and increasing the dose of MDMA won&#039;t make it more similar to LSD.&nbsp; One way to find out what it&#039;s like, guess you are on the correct site.

				I&#039;ve not candyflipped as I&#039;m so much into MDMA any more, but definitely definitely definitely take MDMA on its own, preferably several times, before you candyflip.&nbsp; I only say that because then you know what you are dealing with.&nbsp; Likely you&#039;ll be fine but best to know what you are in for with both drugs before combining them.

				Either way you&#039;ll have a good night! :) as long as you don&#039;t bang 3g of the shit in one night that is and just keep normal doses.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t get that out of my head... 3g.&nbsp; 100mg=good, 200=fucking amazing, but the line with dosage on the Y axis and enjoyment on the Z axis doesn&#039;t keep going up!!&nbsp; 3 grams, holy shit...

				LSD is fun and Molly are fun, but they aren&#039;t much alike. LSD is introspective and a very deep drug, and not terribly euphoric. Tons of Molly (hell, a LOT less than what you&#039;ve been taking apparently) will make you so euphoric your shit-eating grin will be permanent. I&#039;ve heard combining the two in average doses is a fucking blast though.

				If you use 3-4 grams of MDMA you have mass tolerance and despite that its really unhealthy. <br /><br />If you candyflip use 80% of the MDMA and LSD you normally use especially for a first timer.

You never know if you will react negatively (or if you have a run-in with the po-po), and if you do, the LSD will aggravate the issue.<br /><br />You might fuck yourself up. I would recommend against unnecessary risks.

				If you take 2-3 grams of MDMA your body will start shutting down very rapidly and you&#039;d experience extreme paranoid and angry delusions before you fall on the ground, foam at the mouth, and die. <br /><br />LSD doesn&#039;t do that as far as I know...
