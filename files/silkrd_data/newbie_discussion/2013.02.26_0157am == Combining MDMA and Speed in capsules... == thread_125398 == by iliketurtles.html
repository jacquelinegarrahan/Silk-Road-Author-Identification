				Hello there,<br /><br />Just wondering what some of you would recommend when it comes to mixing speed and MDMA. Now I know that it increases the neurotoxicity and that too much speed can reduce the roll of the MDMA, but I find that MDMA by itself doesn&#039;t give me that energy hit that I normally get from pills (which are obviously cut with something).<br /><br />So, I have a music festival this weekend that I&#039;m attending and have some empty caps to fill -- does 100mg MDMA and 25mg of speed sound good/okay? The MDMA is very &quot;smacky&quot;, and can knock you for 6 -- so I&#039;m trying to counteract that. The festival is 10 hours long (12PM-10PM) and I&#039;m trying to go the entire time, what sort of dosages at what times would you guys recommend? It&#039;s not my first time, but normally I end up crashing at about 8:30ish ... so maybe I should wait until about 2PM before I drop? Should I start off with 50mg of speed and then an hour or two later do 100mg of MDMA? then some more MDMA as I feel it? I&#039;m a bit of a bigger guy.<br /><br />Note: I&#039;m not a regular user, the last time I used MDMA was last Friday when I tested it on myself (100mg) -- before that, it&#039;d be close to about 18 months. <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				You won&#039;t get through 10 hours on MDMA and still be high at the end of it, your body will develop an acute tolerance to it after 6-8 and at that point all any further dose will do is increase the negative neurotoxic effects.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t have a whole bunch of experience mixing speed and MDMA, but what I do when I want the experience to last a little longer is this:<br /><br />1-Get some decent 5-HTP - 5-HTP is a seratonin precursor, and will increase the amount of seratonin in your brain that can be released by the MDMA. This is something you have to be careful with, as it can lead to seratonin syndrome if you take too much of it with MDMA, and it will increase your sensitivity overall.<br /><br />2-For 3-5 days beforehand have 200-300mg 5-HTP in the morning. On the day of the festival cut that back to 50-100mg.<br /><br />3-You&#039;ll be a bit more sensitive, so cut your initial dose down maybe 20%, you might find that the sensation is a bit different, as dopaminergenic response isn&#039;t significantly altered but seratonin levels go higher, so you get more of that &quot;everything is awesome&quot; feeling.<br /><br />4-Take doses maybe 50% of your initial dose every couple of hours - you should be able to go for most of the festival this way, you&#039;ll still develop an acute tolerance late in the day but it&#039;ll buy you an extra couple of hours.<br /><br />5-Have 200mg of 5-HTP when you get up the following morning, and again for the couple of days after that. It&#039;ll really help with the comedown.<br /><br />You should be able to find 5-HTP online or at supplements places, but it can be a bit rare - once I start selling on here I think I&#039;m going to start packaging 5-HTP capsules in with my MDMA capsules as a comedown solution :D

				That&#039;s awesome advice MDUK, I will look into getting some 5-HTP tomorrow! As for supplying it with MDMA, I think you would make a killing if you decided to do that!<br /><br />Edit: MDUK, I know exactly what you mean. I&#039;m trying to earn my way there -- I like to think that when people go back through my post history, they will see that I&#039;m a decent person, not some spamming idiot :D

				i have tried to stay awake for festivals and in my opinion I would start with just mdma, and once you crash from that (4 to 6 hours) start dosing both speed and mdma. No point in ruining the initial roll with speed. Also if your into benzos or opiates grab some for the morning after and for when you finally want to sleep.

				A little foresight goes a long way when it comes to getting the most from your drugs. Always be educated, and do the best that you can to enhance the experience and getting the best possible outcome instead of just hoping for the best. Also for benzos/opiates, never tried either but the comedown normally doesn&#039;t bother me too much. I just sleep it off -- thank you for your advice though, it&#039;s appreciated :)
