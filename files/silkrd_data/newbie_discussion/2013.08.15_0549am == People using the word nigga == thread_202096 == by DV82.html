				Does anyone feel really annoyed when other people are constantly using this word in almost every sentence or statement?&nbsp; What the fuck is wrong with this world and the society among us?&nbsp; It makes no sense to me at all one bit.&nbsp; Everyone calling each other &quot;nigga&quot;&nbsp; SMFH....<br /><br />And if you are nice to a girl she thinks you are strange?&nbsp; Yet, they would rather be treated like shit at times or have a guy treat her like shes nothing?<br /><br />I was raised to treat females like gold (until they use the whole nice interaction against me)<br /><br />I just simply dont understand what is wrong with people these days.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its truly sad

				To Scooby<br /><br />Mi want some scooby snacks.... lol<br /><br />Nothing in the world was or ever will be perfect.&nbsp; However, NWA came out to give the real truth.&nbsp; But after that, in all of the past years, even though I listen to rap/hip hop occasionally, I think that music has and is really just destroying the minds of everyone.<br /><br />Yeam dem girlz jus wan da paper.&nbsp; Just like they find the easy way to make their money.&nbsp; Porn, escorting, side line whores, its so sad.&nbsp; But yet, when a decent guy comes around and sees the potential in a girl, even though of her past, and yet thinks she still has an opportunity to the world in more ways than she can see, and denies it bc she would rather just have fun, wow, females these days, like 70% of them, in all honesty, are just plain out whacked.<br /><br />&quot;Ooooo look at that nigga&#039;s rims, I wonder what he does for a living?&nbsp; Girl get his paper, you know he aint worried about it&quot;<br /><br />Get a bitch pregnant - &quot;Nigga you gon be payin all my bills, watch!&quot;<br /><br />And they wonder why we relate to them as hoes, bitches, whores, tramps, sluts, and etc....<br /><br />Look at how they present themselves, and look at what they do.<br /><br />I love women, dont get me twisted on that.&nbsp; But damn, the same time they want a guy, they dont act right. <br /><br />Cuz, Yous a hoe!

				It&#039;s a racist slur and changing the ending syllable doesn&#039;t change that. Those historically and presently oppressed by the term (black people) are welcome to use it or not use it as they please. It is not any non-black&#039;s place to use the term or say how blacks can use it.

				It&#039;s particularly pathetic when white people use the term. It&#039;s just awkward when retarded self hating whites stoop to desperate black mimicry and think it actually makes them look cool. Wiggers are the single best argument against Darwinism I&#039;ve ever encountered.

It is in no way a &quot;racist slur&quot;. It is a misnomer of the term &quot;negro&quot;, which has been the universal, most commonly used term to refer to people of sub-Saharan African descent throughout history. &quot;Black people&quot; have been referred to as Negros since time immemorial. In fact, in the 1960s and previously the only respectful way to refer to blacks was &quot;negro&quot;.&nbsp; If you called them &quot;african&quot;-anything they were ready to fight over it, it was highly offensive.&nbsp; &quot;Nigger&quot; is a misnomer of &quot;negro&quot;, and is not a &quot;racist slur&quot;.&nbsp; Furthermore, no one is &quot;oppressed by the term&quot;.&nbsp; No one is &quot;oppressed&quot; by any term at all. It&#039;s simply a word, a combination of syllables. If anyone at all is &quot;oppressed&quot;, it&#039;s those people who suffer consequences for uttering the wrong syllables at the hands of other people who believe it should be determined which syllable combinations can and can not be used, or believe that they have a right not to have certain words said in their presence. But a word is itself incapable of &quot;oppressing&quot; anyone.&nbsp; If you believe in freedom of speech, blacks don&#039;t get any special rights that other groups don&#039;t get, and everyone is free to say &quot;nigger&quot; or &quot;nigga&quot; whenever they please, and in any context they please.

				I don&#039;t get it either. If you are going to be offended by a word, don&#039;t call each other it. Calling your race a slur like that doesn&#039;t help their equality at all. I remember Bill Cosby had a good quote about this
