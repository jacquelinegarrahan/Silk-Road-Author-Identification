				Welcome to Roses Garden!<br /><br />I&#039;m a new vendor on SR and my goal is to provide you with the most delicious and potent edibles for a low price. All edibles are made from a blend of medical grade sativa hash. Depending on your dose, they can either provide a nice mellow and relaxed buzz, or an out of this world mind-blowing experience! <br /><br />I am in the process of setting up my business, so listings will be up shortly!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to add that I will NEVER ask anyone to FE! All buyers are guaranteed a safe transaction through escrow, when doing business with me.<br /><br />All orders are triple vacuum sealed and packaged in a stealthy manner to ensure maximum security for the buyer.<br /><br />I will be providing some delicious free samples very soon, so please bookmark this thread and stay tuned :)<br /><br />Feel free to post any questions you have! Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s about me or a general question you have about SR. I will be sure to answer them all (without revealing too much about me ;))<br /><br />Visit my sellers account profile and become a fan! It would mean a lot to me :)&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/11b3871ca2<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3

				Glad to see a new US edibles vendor, especially one with some sativa!&nbsp; I guess the only real question I have is what kind of strains do you usually use? I&#039;m always interested to know the genetics behind products.&nbsp; I also wouldn&#039;t mind typing up a nice review if you want to fire a sample my way.&nbsp; Hope you sell well, I love me some tasty medicine.

				Hey Rose, welcome to SR. I would definitely love to receive a free edible sample in exchange for an in-depth review. I have been on SR for about 4 months and have spent around $2000 and constantly growing. Not many edibles have been able to provide me with anything other than a slight mellow body high, so prove to me that there&#039;s some out there that can knock me on my ass&nbsp; ;)

The birthday is coming up ;P&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, best of luck with your business RosesGarden. If yer tasty snacks do the trick and are a good price you might have yourself a customer right here :) I eat edibles like no tomorrow due to a very stressful life.

				I agree with above posters! Many family members in need on my side as well. I view people who bake edibles as magic workers! Can someone help a newb out and tell me what their thoughts are on shipping to my place. Its a gated community with a bussiness adress basically at the house. They take envelopes and other mail to the mailroom at the security place up front and you can access with your key anytime. But If its a bigger package they drop it by the door since we really have no concern for theives. Would I likely have to sign for anything?<br /><br />Thanks SR users!

				aww man im not one of the 5 :[&nbsp; I&#039;d actually like to try your low and/or medium strength. IKR WHO SAYS THAT?&nbsp; <br /><br />My tolerance varies due to my usually stopping for a few months and then hitting it again hard. <br /><br />At a low tolerance a hash oil bar of chocolate can put me at at 11. ( 11 being so goddamn high that you hear bombs going off outside your window and think you are in a warzone, then have panic attack for the next 7 hours with your blood feeling like its burning white hot. After which you finally fall asleep and hit up 6flags the next day for 13 hours with a flash pass....needless to say....you go into adrenal fatigue afterward. the bombs were because it was the 4th of july...)<br />When my tolerance is high that same bar of chocolate would put me at about a 6 or a 7. <br /><br />I think landing around 8 would be great. especially if thats for an entire edible. So if the person could eat half still get pretty high and eat the other half when ever, good deal I say.

				&#039;&#039;Welcome to Roses Garden!<br /><br />I spent most of my childhood under the supervision of my grandmother. My life has definitely had its ups and downs, but she was the only thing consistent in my life. Even on the harshest of days I could rely on her Double Dark Blondies or her Chocolate Chunk Brownies to cheer me up!<br /><br />Now with her gone, I plan to honor and cherish her binder of recipes by sharing it with you. She was loyal and always there for me, as my edibles will be for you :)<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3 &#039;&#039;&nbsp; <br /><br />^^^^&nbsp; :&#039;( THIS omg. This is beautiful! I love to see things like this. Just awesome &lt;333 <br /><br />Just out of curiosity though, was your grandma baking special treats, or just baking treats. Either way that&#039;s super cool. Excellent way to keep your grandma alive within you, and share the feeling of her love with others. I&#039;m sure your edibles with cheer others up just as your grandmothers Brownies cheered you up &lt;3

				Just received a great review from White0ut! Here&#039;s what he had to say about the quality of my product: <br /><br />Quality- 5/5<br />This will be my favorite part to tell about. Oh how delicious it smelled even through 1 vac seal. It was obviously double dose just by the strong smell/taste of the bud. It wasn&#039;t in a bad taste either. The brownie/cookie 50%50% combo was baked to perfection and even fresh! So gooey! The high was the best however. I took it before a 3 hr road trip and stayed blowed on it easily 4 hours. Given I was smoking down I could strongly feel my body being affected as well as a few visuals, not trippy just as if things were moving inordinately. I loved it really, very mellow and &#039;lax....<br /><br />Awesome vendor will be back with my business! <br /><br />Thanks White0ut! Hope to do more business with you soon :)<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3
