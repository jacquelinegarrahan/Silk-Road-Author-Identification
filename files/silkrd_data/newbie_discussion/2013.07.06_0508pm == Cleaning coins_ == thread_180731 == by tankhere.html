				Hey everyone, feels nice to finally join here.<br /><br />Starting with noobish questions already, I&#039;d like to know how/where to clean your coins before sending them from your wallet to SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried searching for CoinCleaner as I&#039;ve heard of that one before, but had no success.<br /><br />Any method is welcome for anonymizing the path between your wallet and SR.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Yeah but BC has to get to your SR wallet from somewhere first... and I was looking for a solution to mask that. And Bitcoinfog is great :)

				There are weak attacks that don&#039;t require compromising the server. LE creates a buyer account and transfers 0.01 BTC to it. Then they watch where the coins are transferred from that address. Over time they could identify many addresses in the tumbler, depending on how it works, and look for big transfers to addresses that can be linked to exchanges. They won&#039;t be able to get info about individual purchases, though.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a threat to buyers, but the more steps you take to anonymize or mix your coins, the safer you will be.

				There are quite a few people on this forum pushing Bitcoin Fog. I wonder what their agenda is. Perhaps the owner of BF is a top 1% vendor and has set it all up to wash HIS coins (quite a difficult task, I would imagine). I would personally never use it because the 1-3% fee is ridiculous. What does BF do that blockchain.info&#039;s shared send doesn&#039;t? I know it&#039;s on &#039;clearnet&#039; (not that I care) but their mixer is open source, so someone should be able to set it up on Tor (if it hasn&#039;t already been done) and charge a REASONABLE fee for the service.

				Personally, I still say having this extra layer of protection (especially if you bought your coins traceably like I did) worths the fee, but then again, I usually manipulate 2-3 coins at most... I see how it&#039;s different when you&#039;re transferring regularly and in bulk.

				You don&#039;t need to clean your transaction chain. Silk Road already uses a tumbler system that routes transactions through many addresses in order to mask the transactions. You can read about it in the Silk Road Wiki:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

				That tumbling happens only when you pay someone FROM your SR wallet, as I understand.<br /><br />So I still don&#039;t find it a good idea to simply send your funds directly TO your SR from clearnet or any wallet.
