				Hi all. I&#039;m considering becoming a BTC/MoneyPak/cash vendor. No illicit drug activity, just BTC brokering. There are a few questions I had before taking the plunge, and hopefully someone can fill me in on some of the finer details.<br /><br />First and foremost, according to the Greendot and MoneyPak sites, there are clear limits on your account(loading $5,000/month appears to be the maximum). I see no mention of &quot;business&quot; level cards with higher limits, and I was curious if anyone has had success opening multiple cards or accounts. It looks like I can load one of my current online money service accounts with $4,000/month via MoneyPak, but even combined with a Greendot reloadable card, I&#039;m unsure if that would make my BTC/MP/cash vending services worth the time. Margins are slim in this market segment, where profit is limited by the amount of currency a vendor can broker. <br /><br />Secondly, are there any specific factors or amounts that will draw the eye of the IRS, for sure? I have several successful real-world business ventures, all socially acceptable and legitimate. It&#039;s not uncommon for me to make $5,000+ deposits to my personal account every week. I&#039;ve operated this way for over 20 years, and never once have I had any issues with the IRS poking their nose in my business. Would processing large amounts($5,000+) through one or more Greendot accounts specifically draw any more attention than the $10,000-$30,000 a month that I normally put through my personal bank account?<br /><br />Thirdly, how real is the likelihood that I could be charged with ludicrous crimes such as money laundering, conspiracy, racketeering, or worse? There is nothing inherently illegal about purchasing or selling Bitcoin, but I would be lumped into the same group as dope dealers solely for being associated with Silk Road, should the IRS or FBI start asking questions(No offense to dealers). I would assume any decent CPA or attorney specializing in finance would be able to deflect these bogus charges, but I&#039;d rather avoid those unpleasantries if possible. <br /><br />That should cover most of my concerns. All help is appreciated. Thank you.

				I just PMed you with more details, but if you&#039;re US based it&#039;s practically impossible to openly operate as a Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road without risking being charged with some pretty serious financial crimes. (Of course, operating as a black market business wouldn&#039;t protect you from the same charges, but your strategy could involve more offense than defense.)
