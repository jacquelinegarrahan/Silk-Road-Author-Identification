				Hi guys.<br /><br />Ordered on 23 June, messaged vendor three times over two weeks to no reply. <br /><br />Another week passes. I propose a 10 day extension or full refund despite absolutely no communication. SR staff refunds my money, order arrives the same day.<br /><br />I&#039;m irritated that some security issues were not addressed. Irritated because I don&#039;t believe the order was sent when the vendor says they did. Irritated with the complete lack of communication up to and through the entire resolution process.<br /><br />But I&#039;m not comfortable with just keeping the product and the refund.<br /><br />What is the morally/ethically/professional course of action here? <br /><br />Do I leave feedback reflecting the events above? Or do I just continue on my merry way?

				i would give the vendor back around half the order amount atleast, they stuffed you around big time but you did receive it in the long run....they do deserve some % of it in my opinion. if you decide not to do anything the vendor may turn nasty. i would rather settle it with both partys being happy.

				You could send the fund to the vendor using the send to user function in your account and then message the user that you have done so.<br /><br />And then never use him again if his got such bad service.

				Thanks for the feedback, guys. My first thought was to work out something with him, but once again, this vendor does not respond to my messages! I&#039;m certainly not going to send BTC to an address before I&#039;ve talked to him.

				you want an opinion? i got no dog in this fight so here goes: yeah, i wouldn&#039;t be happy at the slow svc and lack of responsiveness but you did get what you paid him/her for - send him the money and never go back to him. His lack of responsiveness is not justification to now fuck him - you&#039;re then dropping down below him if you do<br /><br />my 02&nbsp; - been there, done that

				Personally, if the product was up to par I would return the BTC. I would also post on the full forums explaining the issues I&#039;ve had the vendor so that other potential customers are fully informed and can make an educated decision of whether to order or not.
