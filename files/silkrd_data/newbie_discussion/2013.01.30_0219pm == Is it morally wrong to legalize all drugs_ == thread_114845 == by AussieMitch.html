				I just had a vigorous debate with my housemate, who believes that some drugs like Weed and MDMA should be completely legalized while other drugs like Heroin should be decriminalized for the users but the dealers should still be locked up in prison.<br /><br />He argues that a distinction exists between the general pool of psychoactive drugs and psychoactive drugs that produce a physical dependency. It is of his belief that these drugs should be banned to protect people who are pre-disposed to physical addiction, just like guns should be banned to protect us from people who are pre-disposed to violence. He went on to say that there is an element of manipulation from where the user sources these drugs that would still exist regardless of where they are being sourced from. As with gambling, a large percent of the profits made come from problem gamblers, although it&#039;s not statistically possible to prove this correlation he believes you would find a similar statistic in the sale of physically dependent drugs. He argues that the moral culpability comes from the dealers knowledge of the social harm caused through the distribution of these addictive drugs.<br /><br />Do you agree or disagree with this, and how would you argue against him in a debate? I&#039;m all for complete legalization due to my libertarian belief in peoples personal freedom to ingest whatever they like however he does present a coherent argument for the criminalization of certain substances.

				you can&#039;t compare the legality of drugs with the legality of guns. guns are for harming others and with drugs you only harm yourself.<br /><br />and every drug user knows about the risks of addiction. everybody should decide for themselves if they can handle it or not.

				I&#039;m all for legalization...let people decide what to do with their body and life.&nbsp; Those who choose to go down the path of using drugs that cause physical addiction can go ahead...decreasing their chances of reproducing and hopefully natural selection will run its course over time.&nbsp; Same for those who don&#039;t know how to use moderation.&nbsp; Let people have guns too...just modify them so they are inactive when they leave a radius around their home, hunting grounds, or shooting range.&nbsp; Thats gotta be possible in this day and age, just implementing it will be the main issue.&nbsp; But both of these topics are complicated and a simple answer won&#039;t cover all areas and everybody&#039;s experience.

				Legalise all and lower deaths from alcohol.<br /><br />Give honest information on risks.<br /><br />Most heroin deaths due to overdose could have been prevented by selling pure heroin only, that way dosages will be easier to measure.

				If everythings legal then you can let people make informed decisions as to what they would want to buy. There&#039;d be no allure to something illegal since nothing would be illegal and most of the dangerous drugs would have their usage give way to safer alternatives.

				You can&#039;t pick and choose. It&#039;s everything or nothing.<br /><br />It&#039;ll never happen though, every single country in the world would have to do it at the same time. Otherwise the places that don&#039;t, will become a mecca for users the world over.

				I agree you can&#039;t pick and choose....everyone has a right to do with their body as they please, but that right stops where someone else&#039;s right (to not get run over, etc.) begins. Do not underestimate your friends point on addiction - it is a powerful thing that makes good people do bad things.

				If drugs were legalized crime would severely drop there would be so many less gang/drug related deaths and gangs as we know it would start to fall because their revenue comes from drugs. The government could make billions taxing and regulating the drugs, to me it&#039;s a no brianer.<br />

				Well, its a complicated issue for sure. Lots of good points for legalization abound in this thread already, so I&#039;ll play devil&#039;s advocate.<br /><br />Some of the problems with total legalization:<br />1) Imagine how crazy any country would go, even if it were just for a night or a week, if everything was legalized. People would go crazy and there would be a lot of deaths/new addictions. This is only a short term harm however.<br />2) There is always the issue of children. While many drugs would become harder to obtain with government regulation (cannabis), most other drugs would become widely more available, which means they would be more available to kids, which is a danger many people don&#039;t feel comfortable with.<br />3) Also lots of people worry that with government regulation will come privitization, which could lead to a whole slew of problems (too high potency/ corporate controlled, legally protected drug monopolies)<br /><br />Just trying to give both sides of the debate :)

				To Dovah:<br /><br />1)&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at both sides, and while I appreciate your opinion, let&#039;s look at some important facts.&nbsp; I won&#039;t go too deep into this, but lets look at Portugal.&nbsp; Portugal legalized all drugs in July of 2001;&nbsp; ever since they have produced legitimate statistics that have proved drug abuse &quot;offenders&quot; have actually dramatically decreased.&nbsp; Less addictions for teenagers, adults, and everyone else alike.&nbsp; And yes while it may be short temporary harm, at least it would weed out the idiotic scumbags, right?&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br />2)&nbsp; And, honestly, most people wouldn&#039;t bother taking these so called &quot;hard&quot; drugs.&nbsp; The key is to educated people, at least in my opinion, and make them aware of the dangers associated with the particular drug.&nbsp; Kids will be kids... just think back to the golden days when you were a kid; did you not break the rules, at least every now and then?&nbsp; It&#039;s in our DNA.&nbsp; It is our natural human instinct to question this authority that controls our everyday lives.&nbsp; This authority that threatens our unalienable freedoms, all over something so harmless.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#039;t we?&nbsp; These laws are ludicrous.&nbsp; Rather than trying to scare them away with over exaggerated lies, lets just be up-front and real with them.&nbsp; They&#039;ll find out the truth eventually, regardless, the internet is&nbsp; a powerful tool, and if a lie were to be discovered, they would render you useless.&nbsp; Consequently, discarding any future/present opinion you were to surface.&nbsp; Just look at D.A.R.E.&nbsp; <br />3&amp;1/2) An easy solution:&nbsp; have pot shops grow a variety of strands.&nbsp; Not just the plants consisting of high potency, but maybe even some outdoor schwag-weed for the new comers.&nbsp; Something that would introduce them to the all to righteousness of the herb, rather than throwing&nbsp; them head first into a pool of paranoia.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know, just my two cents.

				I think it&#039;d be cool if there was a legal, licensed drug market.<br /><br />In order to be a licensed buyer, you&#039;d have to take a test to prove your knowledge of the dangers involved and best practices for harm reduction (similar to the written driving test you have to take before you get your license).<br /><br />In order to be a licensed seller, you&#039;d have to comply with laws that limit the amount you can sell per customer within a certain timeframe, and that your product be tested for purity.<br /><br />Obviously the underground market would still exist, but people would also have the option of buying through the licensed market.

				It is not wrong. If you can&#039;t control yourself you&#039;re in a deep shit anyways either drugs are legal or illegal. It should be a choice that we, the people make. Shouldn&#039;t be the government&#039;s call.
