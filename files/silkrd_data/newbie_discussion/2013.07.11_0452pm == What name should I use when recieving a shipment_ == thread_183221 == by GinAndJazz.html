				Hey, this is my first time posting and is probably a dumb question, but I see on the forums a lot of people saying that you shouldn&#039;t use your real name when buying product. In the UK do you need to provide a valid name for the address, or could I just make one up and have it sent to the address? Would it still come through or does Royal Mail check the name against a list of known occupants?<br /><br />Thanks!

				Do not use the former tenants name as someone suggested. A lot of the time mailmen know damn well they don&#039;t live there. Why do you still get some of their mail? Well in my experience it&#039;s usually junkmail that the mailman is like well, doesn&#039;t matter who the fuck gets this cause they&#039;re probably just gonna chuck it anyway.<br /><br />But yea I repeat, do not use the former tenants name

				Thanks for the replies, it&#039;s just that I ordered 10g of weed and it still hasn&#039;t arrived, I thought that it&#039;s best to use a different name than my own considering the amount. Honestly, I don;t know what the mail the previous tenant is receiving, I&#039;ve never opened it, just thought that 10g is enough for LE to consider it intent to supply rather than personal use. I chose it because not a week ago I got a letter addressed to the previous tenant or whatever, thought it may be safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;We&#039;re talking like 15 years since they last lived here, yet sometimes still mail arrives addressed to them and so I used their name for the shipment, kinda getting paranoid about it since it were shipped first class and still hasn&#039;t arrived, a few days later. hoping it&#039;s a glitch in the system rather than anything else.

				Why not just use your real name. That is what everyone here recommends. It&#039;s all over the majority of the vendor pages telling people not to use fake names and how you are shit out of luck on refunds if you try to and do not receive. Lets say you use a fake name and L.E. catches the package. They are still going to deliver it to the door. You have plausible deny ability whether it is your name or a fake name either way. You&#039;ll just be fucked if you sign for it or if you refuse then they search your place and find proof on your computer or illegal product in your house. I&#039;m no expert but this seems to be a reasonable assumption. I always move my illegal shit to an untraceable location when expecting deliveries. It makes it harder to deny when they find an assortment of hash/weed/coke/pills/paraphernalia etc in your place if they arrive with a warrant.

				Just a thought, but what about using initials?<br /><br />For example, DP Roberts could be Dread Pirate Roberts, or it could be Derek Prescott Roberts. See what I mean? May not be anything major but it seems like it might be somewhere in between using a false name and using your real name since it&#039;d be real, just not all of it leaving room for variable.

				Always use your name if you don&#039;t have someone who will willingly let you send them the package and not rat. Then move it to its final destination.<br />If you use your real name and they come knocking, never sign.<br />If your suspicious it has been tampered with then don&#039;t open the package and leave it on your desk and put RTS. (doubt LE would do this, they would just knock)<br /><br />But in all seriousness, if you run tails and leave no traces on your hard drive of ordering, the LE will have no case and they know it. The only evidence they have is a package came to your house, and no evidence of you buying it. So if you access SR correctly, you have nothing to hide and they will just be wasting their time and drop the case.

				Use your real&nbsp; name - it&#039;s more suspicious to use a fake if you get caught.<br /><br />Don&#039;t sign for packages!
