				Hi<br /><br />So I live in a house with roomates who are all goody two shoes. I get my mail delivered here all the time no problem. I am in Canada and placed a fairly large order domestically. <br /><br />For some reason it did not get delivered, and instead tracking shows &quot;Recipient not located at address provided. Item being returned to sender.&quot;<br /><br />Now to make things even worse it now shows &quot;The item being returned to the sender arrived at the postal facility.&quot; <br /><br />What should I do??? I know undelivered mail eventually gets opened. How long until it is opened and they are busting down my door? How much time do I have to clean my house? <br /><br />

				I got my address right, even double checked with seller and he said my address is correct. I believe the postman fucked up and went to the wrong house and was too lazy to double check. I am cleaning my house right now but have a lot of stuff and need to find somewhere safe to put it. <br /><br />The seller said that the post office has the package on hold and he will be picking it up tomorrow.

				that&#039;s one of my concerns - the PO carrier screwing up and he does it regular here - 2-3 times every few weeks we find our neighbors mail in our box and go to take it to theirs and find some of ours in their box. And just had a pkg from ebay china show delivered but never got it - small item, face glass for an old motorola krzr phone but - my neighbors qualify as the neighbors from hell
