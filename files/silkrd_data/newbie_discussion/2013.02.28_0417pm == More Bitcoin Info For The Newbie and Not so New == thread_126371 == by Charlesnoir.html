				Just wanting to pass along what I have learned regarding buying Bitcoin.<br /><br />I posted before about Blue Sky Traders.&nbsp; They are excellent.&nbsp; Super fast.&nbsp; Very professional.&nbsp; Find them at their Onion site for easy instructions.<br /><br />I recently tried two other trading sites, Coinbase and Bitfloor as Blueskytraders was out of inventory for that day.&nbsp; (They graciously sent me an e-mail reminder the next trading day).<br /><br />Bitfloor has received some mixed news lately, but I had absolutely no problems with them.&nbsp; I deposited cash late in the afternoon to a local BofA branch. As soon as my cash deposit showed in my trading account, I was able to purchase coin and then transferred it immediately to my SR account.&nbsp; This includes one more step than if trading with BlueSky, as they will deposit coin straight into your SR account the day you place your order.&nbsp; As a result, there was a slight delay from cash in hand to coin in SR account with Bitfloor, but I really can not complain at all.&nbsp; The fees at Bitfloor were reasonable as well.&nbsp; Check out their site for rates and instructions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Coinbase allows you to link a bank account directly to your account with them,&nbsp; which allows you to purchase directly from them on-line without leaving home.&nbsp; This convenience was totally outweighed by the unacceptable delay from the time I placed my order until the time the coin was in my Coinbase account....Almost ONE full week! Also requires a transfer to SR account.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, new accounts are limited to a 10 Bitcoin purchase per day.&nbsp; More information about them including fees is available on their site.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps anyone needing Bitcoin trading info.

				&nbsp; (quote)&quot;I posted before about&nbsp; Blue Sky Traders.&nbsp; They are excellent.&nbsp; Super fast.&nbsp; Very professional.&nbsp; Find them at their Onion site for easy instructions.&quot;<br /><br />I checked Blue Sky Traders, since it seemed like the easiest way to go, however there were no BoA branches near me, only ATM&#039;s&nbsp; I contacted Blue Sky after another SR member told me of a mail in option they offered. CIM [Cash In Mail] Unfortunately the mail in option is not currently available but they said it will be back in about 3 weeks. I would recommend them for members who are challenged (like me) when it comes to acquiring BTC. <br /><br />Hope this helps someone<br /><br />&nbsp;Blue Sky Traders&nbsp; |&nbsp; ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm
