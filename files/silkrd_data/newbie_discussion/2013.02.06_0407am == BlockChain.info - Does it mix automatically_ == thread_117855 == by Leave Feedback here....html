				i transfered a few bitcoins directly to BlockChain.info from MTGox (MtGox knows ho i am).<br />as soon as i had the bitcoins in my BlockChain.info-wallet, i transfered the Bitcoins to the receiving persons number.<br /><br />BlockChain.info looks very complicated, should i have clicked some button before transfer for mixing? or does it mix without having you doing anything.<br /><br />Wikipedia says its a mixing service but it has so many pages and buttons... i used Bitcoinfog before all the time and the interface is really clean and you know what to do...<br /><br />thanks for an answer!

				I&#039;m new here so unsure but it seems like mt.gox isn&#039;t trusted much anymore. If you use it you should use moneygram to deposit cash to remain anonymous. Or just moneygram to bitinstant to avoid mt.gox and guarantee anonymity. It is then a good idea to send them through a few instawallets before transferring to your SR account. Why did you send them straight to the seller? He could now walk away and leave you with nothing.

				I may have misunderstood, by receiving no. do you mean the no. on your account page? That would be ok. Not sure how anonymous your method was though, so bump for info about blockchain

				BlockChain do offer anonymous transfers for Btc. going out (somewhere below the standard transfer option), but as far as i know they do not Mix your Btc. for you, however as long as your doing your transactions via SilkRoad they will &#039;Tumble&#039; your Btc. for you making them all but untraceable.

				Blockchain.info absolutely will tumble/wash your bitcoins @ a cost.<br /><br />Its an easy process:<br />Log into the blockchain.info site, go to send money and choose anonymous.<br />They charge a fee, a measly 1.5%
