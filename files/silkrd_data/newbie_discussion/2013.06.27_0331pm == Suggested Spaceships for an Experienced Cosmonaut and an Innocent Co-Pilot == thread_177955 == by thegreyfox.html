				Hey y&#039;all,<br /><br />So, my best-friend is a beautiful 20 year-old girl... she smokes pot (on a tolerance break), cigarettes, drinks, has done Coke (only twice I think, once was with me... I was freaking out after forgetting to add the H to a Speedball twice and gave her some when she asked... not happy I did that), did mushrooms once, and has recently been exploring with 25c-NBOMe, DMT, and Nitrous with me.<br /><br />I&#039;m a 27 year old &#039;male&#039; (really a neutrois... as an ex said, &quot;I get to emotionally date another girl, but fuck a guy! It&#039;s perfect.&quot;) who suffers from chronic pain and has tons of psychiatric issues. Due to this, I am Rx&#039;ed a junkie&#039;s wet dream... 20mg Oxymorphone IR, 40mg Methylphenidate IR, 6mg Clonazepam, 1,050mg Carisoprodol (Soma), and 25mg Promethazine a day. I also get 90mg Mirtazapine (Remeron) and 25mg Clomipramine (Anafranil) a day too. I IV all the Rx meds that can be IV&#039;ed (hope to stop this soon... just plug or snort the Oxymorphone and switch from IV Methylphenidate to oral/insufflated Dextroamphetamine). So, I can&#039;t use anything requiring the use of MAOIs... I have a long history of both narcotic and psychedelic use. Until recently (25c-NBOMe, DMT, and Nitrous with my co-pilot cuddling with me), my most memorable psychedelic experience was peaking on an 1/8th of shrooms, blasting off DMT, and then without taking in a breath of air between, hitting a nitrous balloon. I left reality. A super Salvia D. extract was the only other time that has happened. But, I have HPPD (constant tracers, &quot;all-white&quot; wall don&#039;t exist, etc.) and even set my senior schedule back a decade ago while tripping on shrooms (didn&#039;t know we were doing it that day when I dosed in 2nd period... haha). So, I know how to handle myself. And, I know how to &quot;ground&quot; people if a bad-trip begins. I myself have always wanted to &quot;experience&quot; a bad-trip (just like I want to have &quot;nightmares&quot;) and so I never have had one. If you remove fear, things lose their power/ability to manifest.<br /><br />Does anyone have any suggestions for &quot;vehicles&quot; that will take my co-pilot and I to new, intriguing, mind-expanding places?<br /><br />I just ordered another 500mg of Ringo Deathstarr&#039;s DMT (GREAT STUFF kids!)... I&#039;m about to order some AMT (got 5-MeO-AMT back 10 years ago when it was a RC... eye-balled doses. I have a milligram scale now, don&#039;t worry), so I know what to expect somewhat. I am ordering from &quot;j1m1th1ng&quot; and would love to know if anyone has any experience with his stuff? We&#039;re going to get 120 Nitrous chargers off Amazon.com too (http://www.amazon.com/Leland-Nitrous-Oxide-Cream-Whippers/dp/B003BVUURI/ref=lh_ni_t_mi?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2OYJ6S6HVHL07)... so we&#039;ll have the &quot;Hippie Crack&quot; to turn the volume up to 11 with stuff for a few minutes.<br /><br />Let the discussion begin...<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				2C-B, MDA, MDMA, ketamine - or combo&#039;s of those products...<br />more intense go for acid (in combo with previously mentioned products or DMT)<br />aphorodisiac go for mescaline HCl... <br /><br />need more options?&nbsp; ;D
