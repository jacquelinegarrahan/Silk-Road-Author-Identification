				I know Alaska has become a favorite LSD vendor lately and people must like his product but I had a very negative experience and would like to write about it....<br />I took one tab of his 120s and there was no taste-at first- just after a minute or so my lips started to curl in the way it does when the compulsion to hurl is imminent...i held back...I trip often and rarely- if ever - have I had this sensation...anyways..I sat down for a few minutes and let it pass....when the trip started I was hit with a huge wave of darkness...my legs and body ached and decided it was best to lay down...so I did...and proceeded to have nightmarish visions of death- rot- and this immensely heavy/ dark wave continued for another hour or two...after I regained some of my strength I decided to walk around...this proved to be difficult as well.... I felt vulnerable and sensitive to my surroundings...nothing seemed pleasant but rather...hellish...the sun beat down in a relentless heat that felt oppressive and my thoughts were extremely muddled. usually, I attribute clear thought and mind to clean lsd...and also, a calming affect... Alaska&#039;s was had quite the opposite effect. Ive been doing LSD consistently for well over a year now after a long hiatus from my teenage years....a few of my favorite experiences have been provided by MAHAKALA...JANNIS and ofcourse Tessellated.&nbsp; Ive written reviews about each..each were wonderfully unique and different experiences. Seemingly -each- having a signature mark... so maybe that is what was lacking in Alaskas...<br />if anyone has any GOOD or BAD experiences with Alaskas doses please comment ...would love to hear.<br />and again...i dont mean to rain on his parade..he is very reliable and very quick as far as shipping and product are concerned...just didnt suit me. <br />all the best everyone!

				&quot;Quality&quot; of LSD generally indicates its strength. Lower quality LSD may contain unconverted precursors in it but in microgram doses they should have little or no effect. A trip being good or bad is more likey related to set and setting than the quality of the LSD.<br /><br />That being said, others disagree with me and think that impure crystals can cause negative side effects.<br /><br />I have seen LSD crystal ranging from ochre in color to the whitest of whites. I personally cannot tell the difference in the type of trip, just potency. My current batch is white as driven snow, the same amount seems stronger.

				thanks Tess! I am also glad you are around again.... I do not know much as far as what defines &#039;quality&#039; or what leads to a negative trip...but every other experience Ive had - which have been countless- from TESS...MAHAKALA, AND JANNIS...have all been pristine. I may have had a few dark patches here or there but never the weight of ALAKSAS tabs....even the tint outside shifted to a bright- unwelcoming - blanket of grey... hard to describe but everything felt off. like i said, many people do seem to like him so it may have just been me but something tells me that there is something impure... anyways thanks for the response.&nbsp; all the best!

				I have heard of dark trips like that before. Ive watched a friend go through one while I tripped on the same stuff with no ill effects, he was in the fetal position rocking back and forth muttering incoherent things. He later said that he was covered in small creatures telling him how horrible his life was, how shitty of a person he was etc.<br /><br />Unless you had some serious physical effects, like Tessalited has asked about, I would be hard pressed to blame the acid itself.

				Im prompted to say taste...there was something that caused the strong desire to vomit ....I couldnt pinpoint the taste though but it was completely reactionary..... Ive given tabs to sevreal people to see if they like but many have nothing to compare their experiences to....like I said, it was probably just me but Ive never had an experience like that off the road. maybe ive just been very lucky.

				A bad taste could be due to the type of paper or solvent used. If it was something like NBOME then the taste would be incredibly bad right away.
