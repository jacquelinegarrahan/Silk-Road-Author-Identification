				Well, most producers can only get 80-85% pure cocaine, there will always be impurities from the extraction process.<br />I suppose what they mean by &quot;pure&quot; is uncut.<br /><br />I would consider anything past 65% to be high quality.

				&quot;Pure&quot; = uncut, to get actual pure 100% coke would involve some serious Walter White lab skillz

				&quot;Pure&quot; cocaine would put you 6ft under. As said earlier, do some research on the ones who have already tried the product. SOME vendors are gracious enough to provide a free sample. But, with that substance I doubt it will be free, possibly a small amount made for you to purchase via a custom listing. 8)

				Yeah cocaine is so hydrophilic that there has to be something else in it otherwise humidity will turn it to a liquid. Leave a line on a plat of good coke and line of regular coke and by the next morning you&#039;ll see that the good shit is just a puddle.

The process of making coke while nasty has nothing to do with it and can create pure coke.&nbsp; But if your in South America you can buy blow pure and cheap. <br /><br />But anyone can do their own acetone wash to remove cut.&nbsp; It just takes some time and you will loose some weight from your stuff.
