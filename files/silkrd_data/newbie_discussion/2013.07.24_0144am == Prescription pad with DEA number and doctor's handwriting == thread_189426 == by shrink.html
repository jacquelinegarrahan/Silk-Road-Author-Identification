				Hey guys,<br /><br />It seems most posts I&#039;ve come across on the internet say it would be an awful idea to try to pass off one of these scripts for anything good since the pharm&#039;s usually call the doctor or even clinic to verify now.<br /><br />Would these scripts be of any use to me to get something scheduled, or is the risk too great? Could I addendum the phone number on the pad? Some of the scripts are already filled out for things like oxycodone in the doctors handwriting with signature and DEA number, only thing that is missing is the date.<br /><br />Thanks

				It is highly illegal to fill out a scrip for a schedule drug without a date.&nbsp; &nbsp;In all likelihood: <br />-- Doc has issues<br />-- Everybody in town knows it, especially the pharmacist<br />-- DEA might be involved<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to get opiates.&nbsp; Dealing with forged prescriptions is pretty pitiful, IMHO.&nbsp; And dangerous.&nbsp; Sheesh! Is it that hard to find a dealer?<br /><br />

				Thanks henry. The doc definitely doesn&#039;t have issues. Its a pain/end of life doc, so scrips for everything from hydro to methadone are common. The script was just unfinished, and was not stolen. I need not go into the details of how i acquired it, but its legit.<br /><br />Its an entire pad, so I guess if I wanted to make it more legit I could have some thyroid medicine prescribed with it to make the bundle seem more legit for an aging grandparent.<br /><br />Anyone have experience with this? The clinic is in a unique situation to not often get asked for confirmation via fax or phone.

				I would not risk writing out your own scripts - I have worked in a medical records area of a hospital before and pharamcists DO call if they cannot read the docs&#039; handwriting, they also call to verify the prescription, and not just once in a while. And a number of the docs WILL call the law on your ass, you will get busted and WILL go to jail. DON&#039;T DO IT.<br /><br />If you have a good friend who is a doc, you may ask him or her if they would write you a &#039;script, but at least go to one real doctor appointment (so that a doctor-patient relationship gets established); the US Marshalls do check this - a doc buddy of mine told me that the feds marched into his office in the middle of a buisiness day, told all the patients to leave right then, and demanded to see all of the doc&#039;s records on a certain patient (this patient was doc-shopping unbeknownst to my doc friend). My doc buddy was OK, he did everything by the book, but the feds will be assholes &amp; have no problem being assholes (even more than they already are). <br /><br />In short - DO NOT WRITE YOUR OWN &#039;SCRIPS!!!!! You will get fucked, and not in the good way.

				Jesus christ. Just as I had reserved not to forge the script due to your post bull3gern, I opened a drawer looking for my old bottle to get a refill tomorrow. I grabbed the wrong bottle, an old antibiotic rx. and it was full. full of percocets i must have put in there a long time ago.<br /><br />are you god, bull3gern. ARE YOU!?!?<br /><br />

				I&#039;m jealous. I love percs. I was getting them after back surgery for a few months from the back dr., then from my regular dr. for some other problem for a little while.<br />&nbsp;<br />But his assistant put the hammer down on me the last time I called for a refill, said it was the last one, I would not get any more. She was real rude about it too. What a Bitch.<br />&nbsp;<br />I guess I can&#039;t blame the doctors for being paranoid that the d.e.a. might come busting into their office or something. Been a month since I had any and I sure miss em.<br /><br />Getting used to the site. As soon as I&#039;m comfortable I have all my ducks in a row, and find a reputable vendor that will sell to a newbie, I&#039;ll be placing an order.
