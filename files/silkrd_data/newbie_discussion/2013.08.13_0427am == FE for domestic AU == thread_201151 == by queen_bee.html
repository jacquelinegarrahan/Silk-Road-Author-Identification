				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I have done a fair bit of reading and research - bit of a n00b question. Most of the info I have read recommends to never FE for domestic purchases in Aus. A couple of the vendors I have looked at do require this. What is your opinion on this? Is it asking for trouble? When I use a vendor for the first time I usually only place a small order, so I guess if the order didnt arrive it wouldnt be a biggie - but hey $ are $.... <br /><br />Would you trust a vendor that required FE for domestic in AU?

				I guess it&#039;s up to you. I certainly wouldn&#039;t unless they were the sole vendor for a product I was after. If everything checks out - i.e you&#039;re buying the product that has good recent reviews (not the vendor having good reviews - sometimes they sell lots of cheap shit like xanax and try to get FE on expensive stuff) and you are willing to lose money - GO FOR IT :D <br /><br />BTW the aussie thread is great for information like this - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139173.0<br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t, but if the money is of no object, then give it a go if you really can&#039;t find any other suitable vendor.<br /><br />There should be no reason why a domestic vendor requires FE - none at all, I&#039;ve seen them complain about the DDOS attacks causing them to use FE, but its bullshit.

Like I said, just about EVERYTHING I have read advises against FE (especially for domestic purchases), but a few vendors I was looking at today required it - even though it was domestic only. <br /><br />I think I will go with my gut (and the info I have read, and your advice) and find someone else to purchase off.

				One of the major benefits of SR is the escrow system. Basically when you submit the order the funds are held in escrow until you receive goods and finalise thereby releasing them to the vendor. If you do not receive the ordered goods you have the ability to negotiate a resolution. As domestic mail does not pass through customs the likelihood of non-delivery is remote. Secondly domestic mail generally take a day or two depending on ordinary of express post. You will find that many OS vendors will request FE on the basis that there is a greater risk of non-delivery due to customs seizure and they therefore want you the buyer to carry that risk.<br /><br />I agree, would not FE for domestic. There have been a few cases of scammers insisting on FE. Once you have released your funds you have no come back.

				Given the problems with FE scams, ideally FE feedback wouldnt be used by the system until, say, after the 17 day auto finalise date. Seeing pages of &#039;5/5 FE&#039; is useless in terms of assisting other users (I mean, all that was required was to take your money, I would hope they didnt fuck that part up) and just enables scamming.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest a FE tickbox in the vendor review changes thread but im just a noob.

				there are one or two oz vendors who demand everyone FE&#039;s&nbsp; :P&nbsp; However, at least one of them has very good feedback, has been around a while, and from our experience, is trustworthy<br /><br /><br />However, as a rule, &quot;Never FE&quot; .... once you have established some kind of dialogue with the vendor, then you can choose to take a chance ... <br /><br />It&#039;s true that escrow system is the glue that keeps this place &#039;together&#039; and fucntioning without a zillion ripoffs, but as old mate hitch says <br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201151.msg1445137#msg1445137">Quote from: Hitch on August 13, 2013, 07:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably get canned for saying this :) but I don&#039;t think FE&#039;ing is the worst thing in the world.
