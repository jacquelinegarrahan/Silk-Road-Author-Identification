				I really like this forum. It&#039;s filled with knowledgeable people that now loads of things that &quot;normal&quot; people have no idea about. It&#039;s also extremely active. I fear that this rule will severely lessen that activity. That would be a shame. <br /><br />The biggest problem it will create is probably less reviews. We really need the reviews even if the poster only has 20 posts.<br /><br />What do you think? There must be another solution, right?

				I don&#039;t really get this rule actually. I&#039;ve just received a wonderful product that i really wanted to share the experience with other fellas on the road. But now I&#039;m sadly not able to reward the vendor by nice words and help him out of building his reputation up. At least the rumor mill section should be available for newbies IMO.

				50 posts is pretty steep. Ordered from a relatively new vendor and my updates could definitely be of use to others on the fence in the sellers review thread, unfortunately I am unable to assist them. While I understand the rationale behind a minimum post count, the number could be reduced to a more reasonable number that doesn&#039;t just encourage spamming.
