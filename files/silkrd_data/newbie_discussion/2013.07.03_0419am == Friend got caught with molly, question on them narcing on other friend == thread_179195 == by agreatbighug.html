				Buddy I know was en route to a festival, got popped with around an ounce of molly, and is looking at some serious time. I&#039;m thinking he&#039;s likely to narc on another buddy, our mutual friend, due to the severity of the time. What i&#039;m wondering is, if my other friend who hooked this dude up (one of my real good friends) is to stop selling everything, clean house, etc... and all thats left is their word that he hooked them up, and maybe a couple text messages if they can even retrive those, is that enough evidence to cause concern or should he be in the clear? If the dude who got popped mentions my buddies name, think they will investigate it deep with this little amount of information?<br />Thanks, sucks for everyone involved but i&#039;d prefer if only 1 person went away not two.

				Clean house and hope those texts aren&#039;t incriminating because the friend has them and so does the phone company. If the whole Obama NSA thing teaches people anything, it&#039;s that you never ever incriminate yourself via text or phone. It&#039;s recorded somewhere and there are new laws forcing phone companies to save texts. Seems like the only way he can rat himself out of hard time is if he can give them a much bigger fish. Sounds like he can&#039;t. I&#039;d clean house though.

				He can clean house, close shop, and try his best to remove all trails of his having sold drugs.. bottom line is, all that will do is prevent charges from piling atop the possession with intent to distribute that the third buddy is going to lay on him.<br /><br />If one partakes in illegal activities, one should NEVER under ANY circumstances, surround themselves, with any individual that is not 100% solid when it comes to speaking to the law.
