				Hey guys,<br /><br />I know a lot of guys probably going to hate and flame for this but I was browsing through BMR when this guy messaged me on the forums. I looked at his profile and he&#039;s currently got sample size listings for $5 including shipping worldwide! <br /><br />He requires FE and only has 1 succesful trade so far but there was this long ass explanation on his page as to why that is. Could be a scam but I figured hey wth with $5 he&#039;s not running away with anyone&#039;s money. Plus he also offers tracked shipping and he&#039;s encouraging his &quot;detractors&quot; to msg him and he will put them in escrow in return for reviews.<br /><br />I&#039;m waiting on some coins and will be throwing a few BMR&#039;s way and grabbing a few of these samples! if the guy turns out to be legit, he&#039;s got good product on there for decent prices (some of his prices are a bit high though to be honest) and I&#039;ll be doing future business of him. From my messages with him he seems like a nice guy who&#039;s really willing to go the extra mile with his customers<br /><br />here&#039;s the link<br />http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=viewUser&amp;id=215301<br />
