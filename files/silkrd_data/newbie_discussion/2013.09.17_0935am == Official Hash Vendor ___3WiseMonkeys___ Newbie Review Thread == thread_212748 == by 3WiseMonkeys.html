				The package to germany was in transit for 2 days only, many domestic vendors are way slower<br />and i got one of the most wonderfully fruity stinky hashish i have ever come across. <br />The quality as advertised, this hash is brownish with a greenish tint, sticky and oily.<br />It has a lovely taste and very pleasing last longing high. Not couchlocking!<br /><br />Buy without doubts, you get an awesome, top quality piece of hash and this vendor works in a professional mode!<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />//Edit: was lucky to taste the Rif Flower hash

				Product: RIF Flower Hash (Free sample)<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5<br />Ordered the item on a Friday night, it was in transit Saturday and I had it in my possession Monday. It couldn’t have gone any faster.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Very well done. No smell escaped the many layers of protection, and there was no visual clue too. Only when you broke the very last layer, you could smell the hash. The letter also looked very professional and good quality. No need to worry about anything breaking or tearing, and no handwriting.<br /><br />Quality: 6/5<br />This is some sticky hash! It sticks to you and melts near a flame, and if you hold it in your hand for a little while, you can form and press it in whatever shape you like.<br />It smells wonderfully too, citrus notes and it smells fresh. This is one of the best hashes I have smoked – good body high with some head. I’d imagine that this hash comes from sativa-heavy plants.<br /><br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />Vendor responds FAST, and is very nice to talk to. I somehow fucked up with my order, but the vendor was helpful. I also received an order confirmation, telling me that the order had been processed and when I could expect it. This is a very nice detail.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I cannot recommend this vendor enough. My sample was very generous and of very good quality, the vendor is nice, and the overall transaction was smooth. I also received a little gift (pack of smoking papers and filter tips). You got yourself a new customer. Thank you.

				Enjoying this hash immensely 3WiseMokeys. Thank you very much!<br /><br />Packaging was fine. Skins and roach were perfectly timed, thanks! Delivery was extremely quick from Scandinavia. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had bad hash from Christiania and this continues that trend. The traditional maroc is a soft lightly pressed polm with the distinct maroc smells. I find it pretty strong compared to other &#039;native&#039; type hashes on SR, a strong spacey high but you&#039;re definitely high rather than stoned on the couch. <br /><br />The Rif flower hash is slightly darker and higher quality looking with a more sativa high and a light but very pleasing floral aroma. Gorgeous in a joint this one&#039;s great for daytime smoking due to the clear head high. Still potent though.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend 3WiseMonkeys and am looking forward to the next purchase. Cheers.<br />

				Quality 5/5<br /><br />Really nice product and generous sample. Very strong high and nice taste. Quality Moroccan hashish.<br /><br />Stealth 5/5<br /><br />Only my 2nd order but from what I read at the forums this is the way to do it. Business like envelope and product sealed in 3 bags. No smell at all. Very nice!<br /><br />Shipping 5/5<br /><br />I ordered Saturday and even though the seller according to their profile does not ship Saturdays, it was in transfer Saturday and I had it today(Monday). Could not possible be faster.<br /><br />Communication 5/5<br /><br />I received a confirmation stating that the order had been shipped. Very nice detail I think.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Very nice vendor and topnotch product. Will definitely be back for more soon :) RECOMMENDED<br />

				Ordered a Rif flower sample saturday, which landed in my mailbox monday. That is really nice with a speedy delivery.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The product came in a letter with sufficient stealth used. No sign or smell of what was inside. The product itself weighted ca. 0.9g, very generous for a sample and enough to get a good feeling of the piece of hash. And it is really good in my opinion. Very soft, oily and sticky. Together with the smell it is just the way a premium product should be like.<br /><br />I want more of this product, so I&#039;m putting in a order for some more. Probably the best way to recommend it&nbsp; ;)

				[Review for traditional maroc (sample)]<br /><br />GREAT stealth! Probably one of the best I have seen yet, and that is just for a domestic order. I would have no worries ordering from anywhere, as it is really packed well!<br /><br />The product itself is also fine. It is not the best hash on the road, but it has that classic hash-taste, and WILL get you high in the way you expect a good maroc to do! Also a quite big sample compared to the other couple of samples I have gotten :D!<br /><br />SHIPPING was also very good! I recieved my sample the next day from ordering, and he had even left a message letting me know the order had been shipped, which is always nice to get :).<br /><br />Overall this has been a pure 5/5 experience, and I will definitely be coming back in the future!

				I received a sample of Premium maroc from 3 wise monkeys,<br />The sample came in 3 days and the item itself was very well packaged although I think a samller, perhaps just a letter envolpe could have been used.<br />the sample was of a genrous size, very sticky and smelled lovlely.<br />I have ordered marrocan hash off of 3 other vendors on SR and this was honestly by far the best in terms of quality. <br />Id recommend 3wisemonkeys to any user looking for good hash and the stuff I got wasnt even the highest grade.<br />good luck to you 3wisemonekys and thanks for the sample.

				Rif Flower Hash<br /><br />When opened the last container, I immediately smelled the pungent aroma.<br />I took it apart and oh boy it smells wonderful, very fresh and musky smell.<br />Can almost imagine standing up in those hills, where the hash is from.<br />The hash itself is very dense, and with a small amount of body heat, it gets very soft,<br />keep it abit longer and it almost melts between your fingers.<br />I smoked two bowls of it in a big glass bong, felt an immediate rush and very uplifted.<br />Really tasty smoke of fresh flower.<br />It wont render you useless for the rest of the day, like some strong indicas.<br />Feels alot like a hybrid strain, which I personally prefer for the most part.<br /><br />I can only say that it IS of premium quality, and can highly be recommended to any hash-lover!<br />Got 1.04g of a sample which is really nicely done of ém.<br />I even received a pack of joint-paper and filtertips which is nice, although I rarely roll J&#039;s.<br /><br />The communication has also been great, and really fast too.<br />They&#039;ll do alot for the customer.<br /><br />As for the packaging, I&#039;m on expert on the subject. But seems to be up to date and secure.<br />And the stealth seems pretty great too. Although I am no expert on the subject.<br /><br />The shipping was next day delivery, so couldn&#039;t be better!<br /><br /><br />5/5. Overall a top notch experience with this vendor!
