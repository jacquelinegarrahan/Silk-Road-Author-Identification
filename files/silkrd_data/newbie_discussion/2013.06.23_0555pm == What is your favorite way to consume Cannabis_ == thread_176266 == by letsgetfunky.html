				Since there are so many different ways to use Marijuana, I thought I&#039;d ask the question, What is your favorite way to consume Cannabis? <br /><br />Charas Hash would defiantly be my favorite, and I always smoke it in a joint, never got into bongs as much, used to do them quite a lot for a little while, but I always ended up getting too fucked up and lost my tolerance after quitting for while! We don&#039;t really do blunts over here in the UK, for the most-part, I&#039;ve had a few but only rolled one when I&#039;ve bought too much haha. By &quot;joints&quot; I mean cannabis and tobacco rolled, and by &quot;blunts&quot; I mean just cannabis.<br />Anyway that&#039;s mine, what&#039;s yours? <br /><br />Buds,hash, tea, brownies, kief, oil? :P<br />Also what is your most preferred method to get high? Joints, Blunts, Bongs, Buckets, Pipes etc!<br />:D

				Recently I&#039;ve excitedly obsessed about hash oils! Whipped wax, fine sap, mmm mmm mmm!!!! A little birdie tells me there is a product from Colorado in the US they call rock butter, which is to my understanding bubble hash of an ultra fine degree... that sounds highly awesome. <br /><br />Percolation, tiny tubes and minimal water..... consistent and correct temperature on the vaping surgace... glass body, quartz nail... medical titanium nail, skillet, frying pan lol... <br /><br />it&#039;s like i&#039;m in love again for the first time... lol&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D ;D

				I don&#039;t really like eating it. I&#039;ve tried it in all manner of baked goods, but it&#039;s always best when used as an extraction (had a friend who was fond of making Hash Butter, and then using the butter to bake the greenish-tinged pastry of your choice). Eating it always puts me to sleep.<br /><br />I smoke the utter shit out of it though (...like right now!). I&#039;ve been a daily smoker for well over half my life, and I ain&#039;t brain-dead yet (...still tryin&#039;, though!).

				My preferred method is smoking out a chillum...I have been like that since my early 20&#039;s (I&#039;m about to be 32, like anyone gives a shit).&nbsp; Next is a bubbler or bong.&nbsp; But I will only smoke out of those if my bag is on the hefty side.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;ll fry it up too fast.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m a long time smoker and when I smoke I prefer joints but lately I&#039;ve really been enjoying hash suckers.&nbsp; I like the suckers because you don&#039;t get such a spike and crash afterwards.&nbsp; You don&#039;t eat the sucker all at once,you lick on it throughout the day and enjoy a long term, medium buzz.<br />

				Hash is aight, oil is aight, I usually just use ground bud though.<br /><br />My favourite way to medicate is with a vaporizer(Rizer Extreme Q is amazing!!!) I haven&#039;t tried vaping with a Sativa yet. <br /><br />For social though nothing beats a nice 4 foot bong with some ice in the shaft. Smooth, thick and hits you fasttttt. With some joints going while the bong gets repacked

				Never liked hash, tended to ruin my day, non-functionally stoned.<br /><br />Roll up a J and smoke at the end of the day on my back stoop, hose-style vape with a big dinner after hitting the gym (if it&#039;s nasty outside), blunts if it&#039;s a group (or at a party).<br /><br />That said, I tried hash oil out of a vape pen at the tail end of my trip the other day at a festival and god damn...had me actually tripping for another hour or so. Considering getting one.

				Joints would be my favorite. Bong hits if I&#039;m trying to get ripped. Vapes and hash are great on occasion as well.

				A well rolled joint is one of the best things, especially with my friends. A mix of the taste and the way it hits would be what sets it apart from other methods for me.<br /><br />I also enjoy pipes, am currently looking for a sweet glass gandalf or a nice all wood churchwarden. There is something spiritual about pipe smoking for me, plus it is very easy to control how much to smoke, and even if you only have a little you can still get high. Plus many look so awesome and are works of art.<br /><br />I hold a special place in my heart for bottle tokes. I should be getting alot of hash soon and look foward to doing some. It requires so little hash and can be done so many places and overall is just a sweet way to smoke.<br /><br />I have a nice bubbler which hits and works great. But Its not my favorite way to smoke. I do not enjoy taking huge hits actually, and the smoke doesnt taste very good to me. The high is very different it seems to me, I always feel way higher smoking a joint for some reason, and it lasts alot longer. I know its weird but its how it is for me.

				Vape is the future. Just like in the E-Cig world. Once costs come down on units that can vape flower efficiently. Wax is all the rage but the added legality and danger in production has its setbacks.<br />GP

				I like blunts over joints, but like pipes more. And, I like bongs even more! Hookas with the ice tips are super smooth. I really want to try a vaporizer. Anyone use a one?
