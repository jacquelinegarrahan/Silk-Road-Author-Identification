				Sometimes people can get stuck on something if they have something major going on in their life.&nbsp; I have never really had a &quot;bad&quot; trip.&nbsp; Unless you count a friend ruining my high with her bad trip, more than once.&nbsp; It was over 15 years ago, I told the guy I got it from we were going to do 3.&nbsp; He said he didn&#039;t know anyone who had done that much and not to &quot;get lost.&quot;&nbsp; We were young and dumb so we went ahead with our 3.<br /><br />We were supposed to go to a rave and for some reason we got a ride from this weird crack head who worked at the convenient&nbsp; store up the road and our friends mom who is also a weird junkie.&nbsp; We went to the store and my friend started freaking out.&nbsp; She said &quot;I&#039;ve got to get the fuck out of this car!&quot; and opened the door and just fell out onto the pavement in front of a bunch of people.&nbsp; The guy who was giving us a ride choked her back into the car.<br /><br />Instead of taking us to the rave they just drove out in the middle of nowhere and stopped.&nbsp; My friend said she was going to go for a walk.&nbsp; I got out of the car to join her and she took off running.&nbsp; We looked for her awhile and ended up finding her naked on the side of the highway.<br />We got her back into the car and while we were driving she started flailing around in the car and a bucket of paint ended up getting spilled.<br /><br />They kicked us out of the car after that.&nbsp; We were just standing on the side of the road (I was tripping balls but in control) and these AMAZING PEOPLE stopped and asked us what was wrong.&nbsp; I explained the situation to them and they said they were going to go put their groceries up and come back and give us a ride.&nbsp; When they came back we were trying to get my friend back into the car.&nbsp; She got on the hood and straddled the antennae and started masturbating.&nbsp; We finally got her in and they gave us a ride back to her dads house.&nbsp; He was pissed because she kept going into his room naked all night, it was such an uncomfortable situation.<br /><br />The next day she told me she thought she was Britney Spears during her trip.

				I don&#039;t know if it would be a &quot;bad trip&quot; or not, but in the subsequent years of drug abuse since then I never had another experience like it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done meth, ecstasy, huffed spray paint, dropped acid, hash, smoked a lot of weed in my day too, and had a few pain meds here and there (got morphine in the hospital for a couple of days once, but aside from being sleepy and a little goofy I don&#039;t think the dosage was high enough to really do much besides take care of the pain).<br /><br />The very first time I smoked weed, after the high came on, I looked down and my hands and arms looked dessicated, like I had been dead and dried out in the sun for a long time, but with no skin.&nbsp; I could see the semi-decomposed sinews moving as I moved my hands.&nbsp; I swore to the guys that were with me that their weed had to be laced. I was spazzing out pretty bad.&nbsp; They calmed me down about 2 hours later with a bowl of Cap&#039;n Crunch

				I think a bad trip is just getting hung up on a specific aspect of your life that causes you anxiety and because you&#039;re high it just becomes amplified. you just can&#039;t mentally steer away from it. It&#039;s basically a really bad anxiety/worry attack. It really does suck.

				i had more than once bad trips and it is not as dangerous as others tell you. it depends on your mind basically. the typical thing on a bad trip is that you either think yourself into badness, this could lead you to a state where you think all the time about the fact that you&#039;re bad tripping now....it&#039;s like a self-fullfilling prophecy....<br />you could also have bad hallucinations, BUT i never had some in all my bad trips all my life.....<br />the thing with psychic problems is not so clear and in my opinion is a thing of a illness that has been already waiting (sleeping) in your mind, if you don&#039;t have any problems at all, you won&#039;t get a psychic problem unless someone is doing that with you on purpose (yes that&#039;s possible!) <br />If you are on a trip, try not to think about it, try to love the moment.....<br />if you are on a bad trip, try to get down with downers and if you don&#039;t have some, think about it on a science base. you were intoxicated and after some time it will leave<br />

				bad trips can manifest in different ways. i&#039;ve known one person to forget he took a drug to begin with, lost his short term memory and ended up convinced that a series of events kept repeating. he was asking the same questions over and over again and after realizing he already asked it, freaked out that things were happening all over again. it got to the point where he thought his brain was damaged and he was doomed to relive those moments for the rest of his life.

				my friend ordered 25c. im an idiot. and approached this unheard drug like acid. popped 2x 800ug blotters in my mouth, kept them in my gums for 30 minutes, then swallowed. about 1 hour and 30 minutes in, i had to leave my friends house, because everything was extremely overwhelming, sounds were echoeing, my vision was like a fish cam lense, kaleidoscope colors everywhere, objects violently morphing, my mom picked me up from my buddies around 2am, andi got home and went and laid in my bed, i layed there for about 6 hours. i dont know if i was awake, dreaming, dead, alive, i felt like i was on the outer layer of reality and death, holding onto my boddy by a thread, it felt like my brain was as if it was gettting stretched, more and more every wave, untill it snapped. when it snapped, i was gone, in my own reality, nothing mattered anymore, it was honestly&nbsp; more peaceful then scary, and now when i look back to that trip, and smile. so peaceful. but yeah, 1600ug of 25C-NBOMe is not recommend unless your a psychonaut lol.

				I have had a bad trip. I couldn&#039;t tell you what drug it was. It was blotter and at the time in the 80s it was assumed all blotter was LSD but this definitely was something else. I was 17 at the time.<br /><br />It was a school night and I started tripping with a friend on some skull and crossbones blotter (first clue it was a mistake to take it), that I had gotten at school. My friend said she started felling ill and sent me home. She had some hippy parents and they talked her down the rest of the evening.<br /><br />Back in my room, I hallucinated that there were cops pulling up into the driveway for me. I went to flush the dozen or so additional hits (and for some reason all my money) down the toilet. I came to my senses right before the hits went down the toilet and grabbed those and ate them real quick - I mean who would want to waste good acid? So it was downhill from there. I spent some time outside jumping for the bushes every time a car drove by thinking I was hiding from nuclear bombs (yes, a bush will supply a lot of cover for a thermonuclear blast ;)). A few hours later my parents found me arguing with a cartoon cop in the front yard and sent me to the hospital where I laid scrapped to a table in a darkened room. <br /><br />To this day, I still couldn&#039;t tell you what drug was on the blotter. I&#039;ve taken over 500 hits of LSD and never had a response like that. Plus it didn&#039;t feel like LSD. I think that may have been the cause of the bad trip, being on a drug that wasn&#039;t what was expected and not knowing what it was. I&#039;ve taken mushrooms, mescaline, 2C-B, 2C-I, X but never found anything that was like that blotter.&nbsp;

				Could be. I&#039;ve always wondered but never enough to take PCP intentionally to compare. Wound up taking about a dozen hits lol. Got it from a inner city black kid (not to be racist or anything but it&#039;s the type of area it was available at the time). Kid just said it was acid which I took to mean LSD. Guess the lesson is be careful what blotter you take and who you get it from. At least I took it all before selling to anyone I knew and the one girl I gave a hit to had cool parents to take care of her.<br /><br />I should repeat the lesson for the younger in the crowd - be careful what blotter you take and who you get it from. It may be something you&#039;re not prepared for. It took awhile before I was quite right again mentally. That trip lingered.<br /><br />In some ways I think SR may be safer than the streets.

				I&#039;ve never personally had a bad trip, but I&#039;ve definitely experienced some crazy things that may have been almost overwhelming but never had a &quot;bad trip&quot; in a traditional sense. But I have one of &quot;those&quot; stories.<br /><br />Anyway, this one time, my friends and I were all shrooming and this one kid who was significantly younger than all of us (most of us were 17 or 18 at the time but he was 13 or 14) shows up, and he had just popped two tabs of some pretty potent acid. He was welcome at the time because we thought he would be able to handle his shit like everyone else. He didnt know how how potent the drug was although he claimed he had taken a bunch of &quot;watered down drops&quot; before so he was under the impression he could handle it. Long story short he ended up getting naked and trashing my friends house while saying all sorts of crazy things. At one point he was convinced he could pull &quot;dank nugs&quot; out of his asshole. *shudders* Anyway, he eventually ran away from the house and the police picked him up after he was reported walking into a sober living home a few blocks away and his parents calling the police when he came home crazy and naked to jack off to some porn on the family computer. He didnt really remember anything afterwards except that he thought he was in a game and had to escape or something (thus why he ran away from the house) he also somehow fractured his leg in all this madness. <br /><br />Moral of the story: don&#039;t take more than one tab at once if you or nobody you know has tested them before.

Even when I tried to buy it it was fucking hard cause no one would call it PCP. The stuff I got was called &quot;zombie dust.&quot; The dose for PCP is very different from other drugs and the trip very unpleasant if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting into or you take a little too much. Why the fuck people lie about it like no one&#039;s going to know the difference, I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />Nowadays, while PCP is unlikely to be mis-sold, a lot of RCs and getting sold in the place of the real drug. Sometimes it&#039;s just disappointing, but people are doing stuff like selling MXE as Ketamine. If you want to hole on Ketamine and you take that amount (visually, they weight different) and it turns out to be MXE, you&#039;re basically going to die.

				I once ate 7gm of &#039;shrooms and everything was spectacular, and then 6 hours later it was still going. I started feeling clammy and sweaty and thought to myself &quot;I should take a shower.&quot; While in the shower I noticed a small spot on the glass door next to the hinge that had not been cleaned properly. There was something green growing there. It was a fungus that was invading my personal space, just like the fungus I had ingested for the purpose of invading my personal space. It slowly undulated and rippled and doubled in size. This fungus was malicious. It&#039;s sole reason for being was to spread and consume the resources around it. If I left this fungus to its own devices it would no doubt soon take over my entire bathroom, moving swiftly on and engulfing entire swaths of my prized real estate. I must do something, and soon, my entire existence and possibly the fate of the world was in jeopardy. I stared at it, to assert my dominance, and hide the cowardice that was slowly growing within me. All i need is some bleach and the beast would be slain, but to reach the bleach I would have to open the door and surely it would be aware of my intent and ATTACK! What to do? What to do? I&#039;m fucking freaking out and being held captive in my shower...&nbsp; Then someone flushed the toilet in the other bathroom and my shower water heated up to about 200 degrees. Quickly I jumped out, with no regard for my fungal nemesis, and the crisis was averted.<br />That was an intense 15 minutes and the closest I&#039;ve ever come to a &quot;bad trip&quot;<br />p.s. I bleached the fuck out of that spot of dirt I thought was soap scum the next day. I felt better.

				Some of these reports you guys are making are funny as hell (even though I am sure at the time they weren&#039;t all that funny)!<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a trip on LSD that turned unpleasant but it wasn&#039;t bad really. It was the end of a long night and I was still rocking hard but all the people I was with ended up crashing. I sat there for hours by myself watching the clock (bad idea) and started feeling very alone and somehow not very human. Still remember this long ramble I went on about how life was like a cigarette pack. The worst part about it was this Tickle Me Elmo doll that was sitting on the couch staring at me; it was nerve-wrecking so I picked it up and threw it in the corner which of course made it start laughing. Creepy as hell. <br /><br />Only other time I&#039;ve ever had what could be considered a bad trip was actually some laced weed. Don&#039;t know what the hell they put in that shit but we were walking around town and there were people mowing their lawns and we became convinced that the noise was actually people coming after us with chainsaws. We ran our asses back home and locked ourselves in the bathroom for two hours.<br /><br />It really does have a lot to do with mindset and being able to talk yourself out of shit thinking.

				In my experience, every trip has the ability to turn good or bad. I&#039;ll be tripping good for a while, then if I begin to feel uncomfortable/overwhelmed or start thinking negative thoughts I begin to have a bad trip. But like I said, it turns, so I can easily change this back to a good trip by relinquishing myself of those bad thoughts or getting to a more comfortable environment. There&#039;s a duality in never thinking you can have a bad trip; while that is the mindset that will most likely not lead to a bad trip, it will also leave you unprepared for when it happens. In my opinion, the most important thing to realize when you start tripping bad is that you are on a drug, and it will all be over by the time the day is through. If you start tripping bad, get somewhere safe, sit, don&#039;t move, and wait for the drug to wear off, unless you start feeling good again. The only time I had a completely bad trip was when I took a gram of lemon-teked shrooms (I have a very high sensitivity to drugs) along with 3gs of the MAOI Syrian Rue Seeds, and then smoked a bowl of pot with my buddy to combat the nausea. This combination had me couch locked and just getting negative vibes from everyone around the room (only two, including me, out the 7 people in the room were tripping). But I feel I handled it well, I sat down on the couch and didn&#039;t move and a couple hours alter everything was fine.

				I don&#039;t think there is such a thing as a &quot;bad trip&quot; so to speak. I&#039;ve did dxm, shrooms, and LSD and never experienced a bad trip. All of those substances have provided me with very introspective trips that I feel like taught me something about myself each time. I would say a bad trip would be a very potent panic/anxiety attack. As long as you surround yourself with good vibes such as: uplifting music, loving friends, and a pleasant setting the possibility for a bad trip is almost nill. Just my .02 BTC though.

				I knew someone who ate around 10g of shrooms and was convinced that everyone around him was conspiring to poison him. That went on for around 7 hours and I don&#039;t think he got anything positive out of that one. We gave him some benzos and he finally quieted down for a bit but would occasionally scowl at everyone as if he were plotting our demise. Apparently it&#039;s a common thing for people who took more shrooms than they thought they could handle.

What a gift you have wasted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i don&#039;t think its fair to say someone has wasted a gift, but i think i get what you&#039;re saying. there are some demons like dragons who can elicit great fear but when you really meet them and listen to them, they give you the greatest gifts. dealing with demons and shadows is not easy when you don&#039;t have training, and that&#039;s why a shaman holding an ayahuasca ceremony can easily cut down things that can trap a person. i worked with an ayahuasca shaman for a long time and its not until i work alone that i see how much there is that tries to come in when your &quot;mind&quot; is open. external stuff i&#039;m talking about, yes they might be attracted by internal fears and whatnot, but external nonetheless.<br /><br />i&#039;ve had several complex bad trips and some less complex (like two nights ago with lsd). it&#039;s only when working with a shaman that i have experienced very extensive states of consciousness without the need to work hard at keeping the space clean. people take psychedelics for different reasons, and experience wildly different things. for me, it is mostly introspection, and bad trips have taught me lots about myself and the way i see the world (that&#039;s why people say &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as a bad trip&quot;), but during the bad trip it&#039;s really a very hard place to be, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to have help and friends. alas, we might get paranoid and not trust anyone, and this is a tough place, and a good practitioner will know how to calm someone who is paranoid also.<br /><br />i will be taking the advice to have xanax handy from now on, but also i will not be juvenile about things anymore. there are certain things that need to be done in preparation for me, and any time i had a bad trip, i hadn&#039;t done these important things.<br />

				My two cents, shrooms are completely different for everyone. Inside every persons head is a different world then the one we experience, thoughts vary, feelings vary. More people are emotionally stable than others, some are more confident in their ability to travel the cosmic realms than others. <br /><br />A &#039;bad trip&#039; is just a huge emphasis on a thought/feeling/idea you are having during the trip. My best friend, who has an extremely high form of anxiety, can take shrooms and never have a bad trip. I myself, have bad trips quite often and don&#039;t suffer from anxiety much at all. Every time I&#039;ve had a bad trip, it&#039;s been with that bestfriend of mine who has a very different view on the world than I do, different tastes in everything. Some how our opposites made us best friends in reality though. With shrooms I feel as if we each give off a different, somewhat, deep vibe from within ourselves. I felt when I tripped with him, I worried a lot about him, just what he was doing,thinking,feeling just anything really. I learned that our vibes just didn&#039;t connect too. I trip alone and have wonderful experiences. Tripping alone in my opinion is better because you can truly be yourself, just being one with yourself. I believe I&#039;m like this though because I&#039;m always worrying about people. I&#039;m always wondering whats going on their head, what their thinking, how their doing, which causes my trips to be edgy when I&#039;m with people. I&#039;m very interesting in the way the human mind functions and how we as people operate. All in all, it&#039;s up to the person, everyone has their own world inside their head. Psychedelics will bring that world out to show you its there. If you have a &#039;bad trip&#039; look at in a positive way, It usually teaches you something about yourself. You just have to accept it and let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				My first bad trip was from smoking some weed in a gravity bong when I was a noob. Friend picked all the good bits off loaded up and was like &quot;Hit this&quot; 15 minutes later I got really hot it was hard to focus on anything and my face felt numb on one side. I thought I was having a stroke or it was dirty because at the time I didn&#039;t know weed could get you that high. When people would talk to me the words in their sentences were put in the wrong order and half the time the universe didn&#039;t exist. Stretches of infinite nothingness interspersed with randomly ordered words sights and sounds from the real world that I had to put together in that state. I said fuck it and had them drive me home because I feel like a dick passing out at peoples houses. Got home and slept for 14 hours.
