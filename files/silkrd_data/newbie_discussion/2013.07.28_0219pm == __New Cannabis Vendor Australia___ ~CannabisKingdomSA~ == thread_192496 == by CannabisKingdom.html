				Hey Guys,<br /><br />We are CannabisKingdomSA and would like to introduce ourselves to the SR community!<br /><br />We pride ourselves on producing Premium Strains of Cannabis, cultivated using the best methods, with over 30 years experience.<br /><br />Our ethos is to establish good customer relationships, via prompt replies, speedy delivery and super stealth shipping methods. Not to mention, the highest quality marijuana you will see on SR&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Our early feedback from satisfied customers seem to reinforce our claims.<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; Excellent delevery. Excellent product 10/5 very happy&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; Great vendor, weed is of high quality very happy AAA+&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; chronzzo buds overweight very generous pack up fast shipping great vendor! will definitely be back for more<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; fast delivery good stealth good communication good product 5/5 :D&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; WOW!!! Awesome new vendor! Fast shipping and well packaged with top stealth. Some may not like that the buds are a little compressed but personally I have a electronic grinder that loves a tight little nug and fluffs it right back out again.<br /><br />Buds are well manicured and cured. Beautiful looking and stinky like you wouldn&#039;t believe. Got down to the last of the vac seal (several used and MBB used as well) and I could smell it! Couldn&#039;t through all the other layers but yeah that last layer I could straight away.<br /><br />The extra present is just awesome too guys so thank you so very much for that. Can&#039;t wait to try this stuff and will update this straight after I have.<br /><br />Buy with confidence though guys. Expensive but I honestly feel like this is going to be the go to guy for ultra premium buds and in the long run the extra cost will be well worth it!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And here is a review kindly written by long term member aussiepp:<br /><br />&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen we have a new Aussie domestic Marijuana vendor on the road! His vendor account is CannabisKingdomSA (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cad7826264). This vendor sells premium quality buds and hashish.<br /><br />I tried out his AK47xHAZE strain as well as the AK47 hash. Before I get on to the review of the product, I&#039;d like to briefly talk about the vendor. So far, the vendor has been a pleasure to deal with. The communication has been great. Very polite and always quick to reply.<br /><br />His stealth was fantastic. Without getting into too much detail, he triple vac sealed the bag as well as using an MBB bag for good measure. The weed was so pungent that I could smell it through 2 layers of vac sealing (however I couldn&#039;t smell a thing with all 3 vac seals and the MBB.). The delivery time took a couple of days but I have nothing to complain about in that regard.<br /><br />Now, on to the product. I can honestly say this is the best bud I&#039;ve ever smoked. The amount of trichomes on the bud was absurd. His claims of 20% THC is not an understatement. This guy clearly knows what he&#039;s doing and has quite obviously been growing for decades.<br /><br />I chopped up the gram and smoked it with 3 friends. Usually, a normal gram of weed would be smoked with in 30-60 minutes. This gram lasted us hours and got us insanely stoned. I was smoking &#039;baby&#039; cones because I found it to be even too strong. The weed had the most pungent smell my nose has yet to experience. I&#039;d give it 3 thumbs up if I had 3 thumbs ;)<br /><br />Now, for the hash. I&#039;m not super experienced with hash so this was a treat for me. It was nice and sticky with a very distinct smell. We dried it out a bit and sprinkled it into a couple of joints and smoked the rest through hot knives and bongs. I&#039;ve never been that stoned before. Man, I was so high. The greatest thing about it was that I experienced little to no anxiety (I usually get a bit anxious/panicky when I smoke weed.)<br /><br />I really don&#039;t have anything negative to say about this vendor or his product. The one thing I could complain about is the price considering it is very expensive but now that I&#039;ve smoked it, I know for a fact it is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to try out some new bud, I definitely recommend CannabisKingdomSA. You wont be disappointed.<br /><br />Shipping time - 5/5 (Wasn&#039;t next day but I believe that&#039;s due to distance and not in the vendors control)<br />Communication - 5/5<br />Stealth - 5/5<br />Product - 10/5<br /><br />Overall - 5/5<br /><br />I&#039;ll be back, once I can afford it!<br /><br />-AussiePP&quot;<br /><br />But don&#039;t let our description, reviews or feedback influence you, we encourage you to try our premium strains, as we GUARANTEE that will be back time, and time again!<br /><br />Hope to do business with you all soon.<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br /><br />~CannabisKingdomSA~
