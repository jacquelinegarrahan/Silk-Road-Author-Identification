			<dd class="postbody">
				It&#039;s all over these forums -- &quot;don&#039;t FE!! If you FE you&#039;re an idiot!!&quot;. Which is fair enough, since if you FE and get scammed you&#039;ve totally enabled the scammer.<br /><br />I got asked to FE for the first time the other week, and based on the seller having plenty of good feedback (and me having less than 5 transactions) I decided to risk it. Order arrived fine, no problems.<br /><br />It seems to me, looking at seller feedback, that being asked to FE is _really_ common. What do people think? Is FEing just part of the road, or should it always be avoided at all costs? <br /><br />

				I have once, though I was not asked to, I did it accidentally. Given the experiences I am having now even without FE. My inclination is that no I would not. FEing is like gambling and I live too close to poverty to have two major vices. Gambling is too low profit for me and has far less sure of a rush.

				I&#039;ve done it a couple of times. One time the vendor offered a large amount extra for customers who FE&#039;d, as a promotion. Everything fine there. The other time was for an international MDMA order, which I was a little sketched out about, and ultimately got seized by customs. I was refunded (outside of escrow) the proper amount, as promised on the vendor&#039;s page. <br /><br />Just be careful who you do it for. Read feedback and research the vendor via these forums before you buy!

				So far, I never have. I&#039;ve only made small purchases and always seek out a vendor that will stay in escrow. I&#039;m not saying that vendors\people aren&#039;t trustworthy, but I AM saying that since my money is in escrow I&#039;m not asking the vendor to trust me... I&#039;m asking them to trust Silk Road.<br /><br />Finalizing early places total trust in your vendor (not Silk Road), and SR themselves tell you not to do it. So I don&#039;t.

				You are a criminal conducting an illegal drug deal with another criminal. The most trusted vendor on SR asked his customers to FE and then disappeared with their money. Escrow is provided for your protection. It is common sense to use it.

				Never, ever, ever, not ever. For every vendor who wants FE, there are five who do not: just shop around. And don&#039;t be afraid to tell a vendor that you are ordering from someone else because you don&#039;t support the practice of asking for FE. In this, as in any other marketplace, you speak with your dollars. If every SR buyer refused to FE, the practice of requiring FE would be extinct within 24 hours.

Sometimes this is because of scams or seizures, and sometimes the result of assholes not finalizing on time when they actually receive their product, so please remember to finalize immediately after you have drugs in hand. If you don&#039;t, the transaction will auto-finalize after 17 days, and be visible on your stats for a long time. Understandably, even one auto-finalize on your record will make many vendors pass on serving you.

If you do a search you will find references to him in the forums. At the time he was the biggest seller on SR. Estimates vary on the amount lost by those customers he persuaded to FE - I have seen 20,000 BTC mentioned, and &quot;over one hundred thousand dollars&quot;.

				I FE&#039;d on my first round of orders... This is because I basically just ordered a bunch of samples so no big loss... But I saw the post above mentioning enabling the scammers... good point.. I read through every page of the reviews on the 6 vendors I dealt with so I do feel comfortable with my decision... However, that being said I don&#039;t think I will be finishing early any more. Sample orders are one thing, bulk orders are completely different... IMO

				.. holy hell! Thats such a bummer man. to build up such a credible rep. to fuck all the people who&#039;s trust you have earned through time. cant trust anyone. He probably would have made twice that money if he was patient and just kept up with what he was doing in the first place. idk, but what a way of going out. crazy. This really twisted thought comes to mind in me now. which is, who&#039;s to say that same guy isn&#039;t capable of doing that exact same thing?! I mean how does silk road deal with catastrophic issues like this? anyone know? Do they just expel the account for good, or the users IP as well? I mean if he made all that loot and was able to slip through the cracks without dishing out any product or getting any serious penalty other than loss of an account with high status. why not just start a new account from scratch, rebuild rep (which the guys probably more than confident he can do) with a new Identity on the road. I mean obviously I may be going WAY outside the box with what I posted, but just a thought, you know? The internet &amp; its transition is so fucking weird to think about sometimes; because in a way the internet isnt even real. yet over time we have all adapted and trust it in our life and finances without a second thought at times. for me at least, I primarily feel its part of having to do with that comfort you get in your own private domicile. like, Forgetting that the nature of the internet extends past the walls of this room I am physically in; &amp; that people can chew you up &amp; spit you back out if you are not careful and give them the opportunity haha much like the real world. idk, sorry if i sound crazy lol.

I believe in circumstances that you finalize early and the package does not arrive by fault of the vendor. if its an honest vendor, they will give you a certain % refund based on whatever their polocies, or even reship the same product. However, it has to be their fault, not your fault ex: giving false name or address to vendor that can have the package potentially not be delivered to destination or the mailing services fault. whatever the mistake may be. If its not the vendors vault, not their problem if they actually shipped it and have proof of doing so via tracking. However if its a bogus vendor that played you, its something you have to take up with SR admins, and with that dont quote me on this. someone correct me if im wrong, but to my understanding is it if you did not finalize early but bought from a scammer you are deemed a full refund, but if you did FE and got scammed you are only deemed 50%? or does it vary upon the circumstances? I dunno hope that helped. if i am wrong on something someone will correct me. Im assing out for real this time. night.

				Earlier I&#039;ve said you&#039;d be stupid to ever FE.&nbsp; You&#039;d be stupid to FE if your buying something domestically where there are a ton of good sellers who will not require it, which is true for stuff like MDMA.&nbsp; On the other if your looking for Heroin it might be a lot harder to find someone who won&#039;t require it; or also if your looking for something a little more rare.&nbsp; Then you really have to evaluate the seller a little more, and if its worth it, go ahead but realize it&#039;s def more of a risk.

				There are 2 long time vendors on SR I have FE&#039;d for but don&#039;t use them unless I have to. Remember, one of the biggest ripoffs on SR was done by a guy (Tony76) who had been one of the top rated vendors for a long time and had a flawless rep. Then holds a huge 4/20 sale where everyone had to FE and the guy walked off with between $100,000 and $250,000. So, even when dealing with vendors with long established reps you are still at risk. <br />FE if you absolutely must BUT do not whine if you get taken to the cleaners.

				This is my first month on SR and I too took a bunch of time to look at the forum and feedback system to get a feel as to who has the best reputation, gear, and stealth...and fewest complaints as well.&nbsp; Then I ordered two items from 2 separate vendors.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now I suppose it could be argued that I should have waited but om my first 2 orders but FE&#039;d both!&nbsp; So far one has arrived and one still in transit.&nbsp; So my data set is completely worthless for any kind of statistical analysis...sorry..

				I did for DonaldDraper once. Got a great note back, very reassuring, very quick shipping and legit product. That said, i don&#039;t think I&#039;d do it again. I did it for a little cheaper product, but in future will stay in escrow even if I pay a little more.

				Well actually, I do FE. The guy I order from has never let me down so far and even throws in a few extra&#039;s if I FE. I know it&#039;s not smart to do and when I get scammed it`s my own fault. I also must add he`s the only person I order from on silkroad at the moment. I never order big amounts so I guess it`s worth the &quot;risk&quot;. An order has always arrived on the day he told me it would arrive. Not a day earlier and not a day later. Quality was also very good and always a bit overweight.<br /><br />The reason my vendor prefers that I FE is because way too many people let their order auto finalize. Oh and I must not forget to mention that he does NOT require FE but it is optional. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Some perceived quality vendors seem to insist on it when you are new to SR. Did not like to do it, but luckily it worked out. Once I pass the necessary &quot;hurdles&quot;, will 100% avoid it, too risky, and as I read here, even highly rated may take the money and run!!

				Never FE.. Just find a different vendor. Ask the guy first if he will let you shop without FE as you never do that, and if he says no then just say you will find someone else.<br />Let them know it&#039;s their loss.<br /><br />There was a vendor here not long ago who didn&#039;t wan&#039;t to ship anything unless you would FE and gave a rating of 5/5 . Several people fell for this. I asked him to buy without FE, and he said no. I later reported him to admin and havent seen him since :-D<br /><br />What good is the rating system if you get forced to rate before shipping

				I FE&#039;d on my 1st two transactions, and luckily it paid off. I ordered from reputable vendors, but even that, as people have said previously in this thread, is no guarantee of success. Scams have happened, people have been burned.<br /><br />I suppose I was fortunate, and I won&#039;t FE ever again, no matter what the vendor&#039;s rep.<br /><br />Also like previous poster have said: there are many vendors out there that don&#039;t require FE, even for new accounts, so I&#039;d do your research and go with one of those ideally. In hindsight I would have done the same.

				DO NOT FE!! I&#039;ve only been here a few months and I know that. That&#039;s the first thing I learned here...<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve seen a few of the more senior vendors require FE in certain circumstances, and considering most of them have a 5.0 rating and like 300+ transactions it&#039;s alright- sometimes they just need it to re-up, or after an order has been submitted for something they JUST ran out of. Probably happens a lot more than ppl think.<br /><br />I repeat... DO NOT FE unless you ABSOLUTELY trust the vendor.<br /><br />Early finalization is how people get ripped off<br /><br /><br /><br />
