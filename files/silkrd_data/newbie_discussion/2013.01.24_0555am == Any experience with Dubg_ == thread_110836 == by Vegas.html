				I have some experience with DubG´s Tina....<br /><br />Shipping:<br /><br />As DG puts it on his VP, people don´t return for his speed and that´s true.<br />The 4, SR allowed, days to prepare the order with only a few hours to spare, agony to wait, impatience is a piece of shit best IV`d cold...<br />But after that it´s fucking lightspeed, the usual estimated time ranges from 10-25 days with an average of 15-20 but got here in half the time :) <br /><br />Package:<br /><br />Nice, non negative-attention-attracting, appearance.<br />The interior is well cared for, time has been spent on refinements on concealment and what I believe to be a very smart stealth-enhancing feature tops it all of.<br /><br />Product:<br /><br />The shards is a mixture of small, crushed, and medium size, 1x0,5 cm / piece, but the shard size don´t set the quality... alto it makes one happy when &quot; 1shard1gram&quot; applies!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I don´t really know what´s up tho, I´v been in to meth for some time now and I haven´t burnt, or over-heated, since my second gram or so. (not in the 3-digit club yet but getting there soon)<br />Well it gets heated really rapidly so be on your guard, the taste of over-heated gear is horrible, but that goes for all batches out there, I just don´t know why I have problems with not reaching that point, it´s a fine, fine line.<br />Either way It gives you a slow start, not the skin-crawling hair-raiser that you encounter once in a while, and after a few lungs full you feel very fresh, no involuntary twitching, and it´s okay to just be alert and clearheaded as fuck without muscles trying to go in all directions at once.<br />Writhing and talking becomes increased by the minute, it´s the stuff you really badly would´v loved to have in arms reach all those years ago when the stack of homework almost reached the ceiling.<br />I could easily erase that stack with 1 or 2 grams of this stuff and 3 days of insomnia to my disposal.<br /><br />But as I keep over-heating it I tried grinding it down and gave thee old snout a run for it, burns like hell, like it should, and according to me that worked way better so will do the rest of it like that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I will definitely try a future batch if the price remains, hopefully it´s easier to smoke or that I get my technique back if that´s the case&nbsp; :P
