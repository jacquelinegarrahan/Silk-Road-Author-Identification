				Hi everyone&nbsp; :) So I&#039;m very new to this and could really use some advice. I&#039;m not computer smart at all.. I&#039;m having a very hard time understanding PGP, bitcoin, etc. From what I&#039;ve read just having PGP isn&#039;t good enough and that there is a bit that goes into being completely anon. I read this post http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0 and well honestly it&#039;s a lot for me to take in and frankly I don&#039;t get everything I&#039;m reading :(. Is this all necessary? If the vendor accepts it can I just PM them my address? Do I use a fake name? blah blah &gt;_&gt; (sucks being a noob)<br /><br />I&#039;m probably not going to use SR that often. I smoke weed, but I have my guy for that. I&#039;m just looking to get some shrooms for my first time.. maybe DMT down the road. Do the police really crackdown on people like me trying to buy? Any advice would be great. Thanks. <br />&nbsp;<br />- Auroraborealis

				Hi Auroraborealis,<br /><br />Welcome to SR! My first advice to you would be to persevere and read through the forums. Naturally a lot of people come through here who want to score some weed but it&#039;s very important that you do this in a way that&#039;s safe for you.<br /><br />My GPG software of choice is GPG4USB and there is an excellent, simple tutorial on how to use it here : http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />If you&#039;re new I suggest you try and use the TAILS operating system (tails.boum.org) which can be installed on a USB stick so is ideal for beginners who don&#039;t want to leave any trace of their activity on their own machine.<br /><br />Any questions, use the search function on the forum and if you can&#039;t find the answer, do ask!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139092.msg943435#msg943435">Quote from: Auroraborealis on March 27, 2013, 12:21 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi everyone&nbsp; :) So I&#039;m very new to this and could really use some advice.

				Hi,<br /><br />Not all vendors on the road require PGP for communication or giving your adress<br /><br />This is in the SR wiki:<br /><br />&nbsp;Receiving address<br /><br />From the moment you submit your order, to the moment it is displayed to your vendor, the information is fully encrypted and totally unreadable. Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is irretrievable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key so that even we at Silk Road would be unable to view it, even if we wanted to. <br /><br />I&#039;ve already made&nbsp; successful transactions from about 10 vendors and only one of them required pgp for communication and shipping details<br /><br />Just my humble opinion though<br /><br /><br /><br />

				PGP is highly recommended and since it really is pretty easy, there is no real reason not to do it and give yourself the best protection possible.<br /><br />The tutorial Fugitive linked you to is a really good one, I used it and found it easy to follow and use. <br /><br />I suggest you try and take things in steps rather than trying to understand everything at once because it can be a lot to take in. So maybe first decide how you want to run Tor and what OS you will use - tails, liberte etc. Reading through the Security subforum will give you lots of good information.<br />Once you have your computer ready to go and secure, you can then learn pgp. <br />Once you&#039;ve done that, learn how and where to get bitcoins.<br />Then you&#039;ll be ready to go. It takes some time, but it is worth it to be safe and secure. <br />

				Yes, all you have to do is generate your key and after you have imported the other persons key just go to the clipboard like you would for a normal encription and there is a box to check to sign the message with your personal key which you set up before, so in order for the person to decode the message they would need your key pass.

				Thanks xda. I already have all the keys. I was just wondering if it was possible to send a signed AND encrypted message in gpg4usb as well as an unencrypted one. The tutorials don&#039;t mention this and it didn&#039;t work last time I tried it.
