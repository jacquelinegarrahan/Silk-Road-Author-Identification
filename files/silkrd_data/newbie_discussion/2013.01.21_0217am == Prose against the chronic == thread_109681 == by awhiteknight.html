				I was an habitual cannabis user for around 15 years before I saw the light, a burning light that pains the ego, hurts because the culture says that we are the drugs and it&#039;s part of who we are. We like who we are. It&#039;s an unpopular thought around these parts, that the Big Beat Manifesto is false and chronic drug use is nothing to be proud about.<br /><br />I remember an aging hippy granting me an Oracle&#039;s insight, imparting a wisdom that drug use is okay but drugs culture is dangerous. If your crowd revolve around the next high then you&#039;ll end up on smack and crack, don&#039;t get caught up in culture and the fashions, don&#039;t let it define you as a person. Be an individual, use don&#039;t abuse. And I took that advice, mostly anyway, but what I didn&#039;t realise at the time is that she was another hypocrite full of beads and tie dye and fifteen spliffs a day. How is waking up or coming home to a joint smoked alone different from waking up to a bottle of vodka?<br /><br />Yank stoners or Brit pot heads wear this embarrassment like a badge of honour, hey man look how we&#039;ve been consumed by the herb rather than us consuming it. This is who we are, firstly drug users and secondly individuals. It&#039;s shameful. What did I get out of my 15 year long hobby? I can roll the perfect joint and I can beat you at Counter Strike. I could have learned to paint and play a bunch of musical instruments, learned how to rebuild an engine or I don&#039;t know, spent 10 years doing something that requires effort and makes me worth a load of money instead of lazy pot-headed procrastination. <br /><br />And to think all that time I was sneering at soap opera drones while thinking my toking and staring into a different piece of furniture was somehow more worthwhile.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get high errryday or alone, get a hobby that creates skills, get up and do shit and stuff. Yeah.
