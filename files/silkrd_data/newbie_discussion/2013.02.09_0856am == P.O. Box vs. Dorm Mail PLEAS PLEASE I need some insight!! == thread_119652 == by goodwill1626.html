				Ok I work at a dorm. This is how mail works: USPS Mailman arrives with a bag of mail (packages, letters and magazines). This is delivered to the front desk. The desk worker sorts through the mail, takes the packages, logs them in a mail log (date arrived, room number, persons name), then places a slip in the persons mailbox. The packages are then stored in a mail room which is locked. You take the package slip to the desk worker and sign the mail log where your package was recorded (showing that you picked up your package) and then, they give you your package. Now I, being a desk worker, have access to the mail-room, and I also sort mail and take mail regularly. I was debating sending stuff to the dorm or a USPS P.O.&nbsp; Box. Initially I thought this was a terrible idea, because if I ever got busted I&#039;d lose my job, they may kick me out of the dorm, and I may be booted from my major. The losses are potentially HUGE. But here are the pros. The desk workers (myself included) don&#039;t look for anything suspicious when mail arrives. We log it, and forget about it. Second, I can access the mail room and grab my package anytime it arrives. Third, if my package arrives while I&#039;m working desk I can simply take it without documenting it. Fourth, I don&#039;t have to sign for anything official (USPS uses the desk workers signature for ALL the packages). Fifth, I don&#039;t have to show my face to a USPS employee or be on camera.&nbsp; However, the cons: signing the mail binder (the signatures eventually get thrown away at the end of the semester). The fact that I am ignorant of the mail process before the bag arrives at the dorm (whether or not it is any safer than the process of storing it in a P.O. box), if I get busted, I get busted big. Now here&#039;s the deal on my P.O. box. 1) there are no ma and pop P.O. Boxes in my area. 2) the USPS po boxes are not 24/7. 3) they are small and cannot hold a package bigger than a shoebox. 4) I have to walk into a USPS establishment where (I suspect) they are more cognizant of &quot;suspicious&quot; packages. What should I do? Let me know what you think is the safest route. (I will not be using a fake ID or false identity under either option--I dont wanna mess with mail faud. Just an fyi :)&nbsp; )

				I am a student and I have it sent to my mail box number but I use a different name.&nbsp; Normally people say not to use a fake name, but since your at a school the USPS has no idea who&#039;s there and will deliver all of them.&nbsp; So, it has your box number on it and you take it.&nbsp; But, if you got caught in some way (the USPS searches your package before it gets to the school) you can say, &quot;thats my box number I think, whoever (fake name you put on package) is must have put the wrong box number.&quot;&nbsp; Then act super confused as to why they are talking to you.&nbsp; Anyway, if you take my advice and do the fake name thing, there really is no way for them to prove you ordered it.&nbsp; Just PLEASE don&#039;t make up an idiotic fake name.&nbsp; Like, use a random name of facebook, just don&#039;t do bobby Joe Hoe, because, USPS DOES recognize obvious fake names.

				Imho... this is a no brainer.&nbsp; Send it to the dorm.<br /><br />The consequences of being busted at the PO box are no less than at the dorm... you&#039;d still be on campus it sounds like.&nbsp; And being arrested does&nbsp; not equate to being convicted... your school cannot discriminate against you if you&#039;ve just been arrested and still on trial.<br /><br />If postal inspectors&nbsp; ever did somehow stumble onto your package, I&#039;d imagine they&#039;d have a helleva time doing a controlled delivery. (let alone making a case in court) I doubt they&#039;d even know you work in the mail room... how would they?<br /><br />Be really really cool with all your coworkers... that way, if anything ever did happen, they&#039;d be more willing to tip you off etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if you&#039;re the one that always accepts the mail... you could always have your packages addressed to some guy you hate in the dorm and intercept it.&nbsp; Just ask the shipper what you should look out for... type of package, return address etc. (maybe you&#039;d have to explain the situation to them?) Just don&#039;t miss the delivery.&nbsp; And of course don&#039;t log that package/delivery... maybe have a premade shipping label made out to yourself ready to stick over the one on the package.&nbsp; (so when you leave work coworkers know you&#039;re not stealing) <br /><br />Just my two cents.

				It&#039;s not your responsibility that the packages don&#039;t contain illegal items, is it? Is it possible to send the mail with another name and still receive it without problems? You being a worker there I see no problems at all, but stay sharp and be careful though. Being a little paranoid is usually healthy. ;)
