				Alright newbies. So we would like to introduce ourselves. We are TSC out of Spain. We ship internationally and have many amazing products (Hash, Opium, Weed. etc.) Check us out at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9de2239028<br /><br />What we are doing is giving away 1g of 2 year old personal Bayer opium from Ace&#039;s personal stash. Bayer opium is picked straight from the Pharmaceutical company Bayer&#039;s personal field stash where they specially grow the Bayer with a higher opium output.<br /><br />All you need to do to enter is post a number between 1-56 in this thread. Make sure not to duplicate another members number. We will be going in chronological order by post in case two people have the same number. We will be doing another contest in the products forum and with such we really want newbies to enter the newbies and veterans enter the veterans. But we won&#039;t stop you from entering both you just wont be able to win twice.<br /><br />*ALSO* - Pm me your email address if you would like to be added into our TSCrewbie Crew. Once we get an anonymous email client that we approve we will start the Newsletter again. In the past Screwbies have gotten stealth listings for free opium, stealth listings with free shipping, and stealth listings with more product.<br /><br />The winning number will be the 5th Mega Millions white ball pulled on 9.13.13 at 11pm so that it will be completely random. So this contest runs now until 9.13 at 11pm. The cutoff is 11pm. Any posts after will be null and void. In the event that the winning number is not accounted for we will do the contest for another week and maybe add another prize.<br /><br />I will update to the best I can the first post with taken numbers.<br /><br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; soulkontroller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12345&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no user name <br />4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gtgeorgz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drinknlove <br />7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; aurelli001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dellboy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jholden82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />10&nbsp; &nbsp; herexvii<br />11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jethropeters <br />12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cryngie<br />13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cabinboynathanial <br />14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bmore<br />15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavyreader <br />16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jones 909<br />17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ginandjuice<br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rs180216<br />19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ppil78<br />20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sweetlyfrosted<br />21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noavail<br />22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; livestr0ng<br />23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bodnostrokulum <br />24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; momoneymoprollums<br />25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snoopish<br />26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the traveler <br />27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kalli <br />28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shopper1888 <br />29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divinemomentsoftruth<br />30&nbsp; &nbsp; anonypunk<br />31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancer183<br />32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jones909<br />33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tintin23<br />34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blueberry34 <br />35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; halfrontal<br />36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree <br />37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poopypants8888 <br />38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strangiato<br />39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donkeykong1234 <br />40&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mrjesuschrist<br />41&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dandantheicecreamman <br />42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frigg26<br />43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wingeddoomua <br />44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinkyjohn <br />45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88fxstc <br />46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; summeroflove68<br />47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vash<br />48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anxious <br />49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hellonheels<br />50&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;richardwagner6969<br />51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teaball <br />52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calicojak<br />53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bubuy555-<br />54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hamnana<br />55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cigarette <br />56&nbsp; &nbsp; suffix

Sounds like a nice gentle way to consume.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There opium tea was one of the most pleasant experiences and the stealth it came in was perfect. It was disguised as a legal product that noone could tell the difference.<br /><br />Anyways it was like this: Stoop 10g of tea for 2-4 hours. I did 4 hours. I then consumed and started feeling the effects after 30 minutes. It was a euphoric body high reminiscence of consuming a 5mg percocet. By an hour it felt like a 10mg, and by an hour and a half it felt like a blue a215 30mg oxy I had consumed. I just lay in this bliss state for hours and then as I consumed it starting at 7pm I fell asleep by 11pm. Waking up the euphoria and body high was still there. It was amazing, and it lasted until about 11am from waking up at 8am.

				What a good idea!!!&nbsp; ;D<br />Very nice way(but mostly very generous for us forum&#039;s users)to get your products listings known.<br />I would like to take number 35,if it&#039;s not taken which it shouldn&#039;t after my quick check.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />I already ordered from this vendor and I would strongly raccomend &quot;Sativa hashish from ketama 10g&quot; (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ca1c89f32c) if you&#039;re into cannabinoids.It was one of the best hash I ever smoked.Strong high but also kind of energetic,after a spliff of that hash I went on working on a design project for hours without even realizing time&#039;s passing. <br /><br />P.P.S.<br /><br />I ordered also the &quot;Bayer pod putty&quot; but unfortunately I never got them.But it wasn&#039;t vendor&#039;s fault since I got admitted to the hospital right before they were supposed to arrive(I wasn&#039;t hospitalized for drug related issues if that&#039;s what you are wondering :p)and they kept me there for more than 3 weeks forcing me to let the system auto-finalize and for that I apologize.<br />Not trying to move anyone to pity,just a thought and and an hope: considered all the above it would be a nice karma touch if it would happen to be me to win this lottery :don&#039;tLetMeDownBuddha:&nbsp; :D

Do not be alarmed. We are getting some amazing Hash that you all should look out for after we are out of stealth.<br />ACE

				Congratulations to Hamnana (Please pm me for your winning instructions) from the Newbies contest. And Congratulations to musichighlife from our Produfts offer page (Please pm me for your winning instructions.) Both won 1g of 2 year old personal stock Bayer.<br /><br />Just wanted to give an *UPDATE*<br /><br />We will be extending our Stealth until around Wednesday. This is because we have taken advantage of the restock to change shipping locations to somewhere less scrutinized by customs. Packages from south coast spain were too controlled so we are going north. We will be back out latest Wednesday.&nbsp; Also we have a new batch of Ketama Hashish that we are processing and will be getting ready for when we come out of stealth.

				Your welcome everyone. Look out for another similair contest when we come out of stealth which will most likely be after the weekend. We also *may* come out with our Coke listings after the weekend as well. It all depends on circumstances out of our control.<br /><br />PM me with questions.<br /><br />*Side Note to US Vendors*: Anyone have an interest in be 1 of 2 maybe 3 (East, West, Central Coasts) verified US Reseller of our product?* PM to start the conversation. Either on SR or here.
