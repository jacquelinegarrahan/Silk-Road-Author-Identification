				What would you guys think if SR made it mandatory to have a SR forum account?<br />Make it mandatory to have at least 50 posts or JR member status in order to make purchases<br />or conduct any business on SR. (this could go for sellers too)<br /><br />This would make sure people know what they&#039;re doing before they actually DO IT.<br />It would cut down on scammers who are just looking for a quick pay day, of a one time buy and not pay or create a new account.<br />I believe it would also cut down on LE trying to attack us.<br />Even the FBI DEA CIA have better stuff to do than reach 50-100 posts on the forums.<br /><br />Maybe even different variations such as minimal purchases ( 1BTC or less) for anyone with less than<br />a SR member rank. And anyone with a SR rank or higher has no restrictions for buying.<br /><br />Just some thoughts, and i believe these can be expanded on greatly, with the help of you guys!<br />I think it would add some more security to SR and despite the fact that<br />it is supposed to be a free market, we have to realize that anyone with an Internet connection can basically find there way here.<br /><br />Lets work together and fight back against LE and thieves!<br /><br />Hoping to hear from a lot of people on this!<br /><br />-Jackofspades<br />

				Yeah I doubt SR would ever put that into action, considering it would limit their income. it&#039;s like turning on the metering lights to get onto the freeway. If the point is to have as many people using the road as possible, then you don&#039;t want to deter the influx. freeway/ silkroad pun not intended, but applicable

				Most SR newbies like to be able to log-on to SR and have a look around before making orders or getting too involved. I personally made an order from a local vendor to test the sites legitimacy before I really started researching on the forum. The Road is open and libertarian, not a secret cabal.
