				A friend of mine tried sending me a package at the post office. The package contained 100 pills of a Schedule IV pill (benzos). Both cities are in the Northeast US region. He (stupidly) gave the post office all his info. Not sure about his address or whatnot but they had his phone number. By day 3 after dropping it off the post office calls him and leaves him a voicemail saying that theres a problem with his package and he needs to come pick it up. Of course, he doesn&#039;t go pick it up. My question is that what is likely to happen in this scenario? If they know who he is or at least have part of his info are they likely to try to set him up for a CD? <br />And another question,&nbsp; if he just ignores the phone calls from the post office and they see that they aren&#039;t going to grab him, would they coordinate with LE from my state (250 miles away) to try to grab me instead with a Controlled Delivery?<br />Well one thing is for certain, I guess I cant buy anything from SR, my address is probably flagged.. :(

				my guess is posted to wrong or incorrect address and or not proper postage paid - i highly doubt something so miniscule is going to raise a flag unless hes made mistakes in the past to bring attention - <br /><br />either way i think its fine. just go handle it

				Wait!<br /><br />Did he go into the Post Office counter?&nbsp; If he did, any &quot;mistakes with address or postage&quot; should have been caught right then and there.&nbsp; If he just dropped it off in a mailbox, then I can see them calling to correct an error.&nbsp; But, don&#039;t they just return to sender?&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to see if your addy is blacklisted, you can order a few decoy packages to see if they are fucking with your shit.&nbsp; Otherwise, you may have to find someone who you trust to accept packages on your behalf.<br /><br />Sorry fish

The post office is a government agency and they have postal inspectors who sole jobs are to find suspicious looking packages, while UPS and fedex are just trying to deliver their packages on time and arent as concerned as the government is to look for drugs.<br />

				How would they know what&#039;s inside the package?&nbsp; <br /><br />If they need a warrant to open a package, then they can&#039;t know what is inside it unless they see what&#039;s inside.&nbsp; I am pretty sure he didn&#039;t leave it pills overt for every one to see.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that inspectors will open it up, find the pills, seal the package, get the warrant, then open the package as if it was the first time?&nbsp; That&#039;s fucked up if they can do that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think dogs can smell that shit, but I could be wrong though.
