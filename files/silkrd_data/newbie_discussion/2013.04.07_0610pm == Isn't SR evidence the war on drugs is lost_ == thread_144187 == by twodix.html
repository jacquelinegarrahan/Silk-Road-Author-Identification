				It&#039;s on the news, the drugs are in the mail, the BTC are flowing and the cops are scratching their heads. <br />In military terms, if the enemy has been irreversibly over run then aren&#039;t they effectively at a point of defeat? <br />Or is it just this battle?<br />I&#039;m waiting for the cartels to smell the wind and start joining up and I&#039;m wondering if they&#039;re here yet?<br />Maybe me and the other guy in my cell can discuss it at length later on..?

				The &#039;war on drugs&#039; is really a deception fostered on the people by government that uses mainstream media to supposedly inform the public, but its really indoctrination into their party line.&nbsp; There&#039;s more drugs flowing over borders than ever, there&#039;s more home labs than ever, long standing supply lines are safe, and some folks are making millions in the process.&nbsp; Every once in a while somebody gets busted and its some media event.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the real shipment went right by under their noses.&nbsp; The decoy trick has worked for years. 8)

				I&#039;d say no, SR is a very small sliver of the total drug market.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t even know it exists. Plenty of busts are still being made by LE. For the war on drugs to be lost I&#039;d argue that LE would have to have zero arrests.

The Silk Road isn&#039;t evidence the war on drugs is lost, but it is evidence that people will always find new ways to deal in drugs. People want drugs, it really isn&#039;t any more complicated than that. The reasons people want drugs are infinitely complicated, but involve either incredibly hard to solve or just completely unsolvable problems. Still, at least it looks like the US is moving towards a country wide Marijuana decriminalization sometime in the not too distant future. That&#039;s a start.

				The only way the government can &#039;win&#039; the war on drugs is decriminalisation and regulation. It turns a multi-billion loss into a multi-billion profit. So it&#039;s a double win!

				Well, technically, it&#039;s just evidence that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is still going on.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, though, the War on Drugs was essentially lost the moment it &quot;began&quot;. Of course drugs are destined to win.

				*Occasional* drug use is so hardwired into our evolution that you might as well declare war on &quot;clothing&quot; or &quot;sex&quot;. Sure, not everybody wants to wear all types of clothing or try all types of sex, but we generally respect the choices of others, so long as, it doesn&#039;t impact us in a negative way. <br /><br />Unfortunately for Them, a lot of drug users are (surprise, surprise) more rational and perceptive than our would-be overlords. So, like the OP, they periodically enquire if the status quo is about to change any time soon, because this or that piece of evidence clearly suggests a change is about due...<br /><br />Fatally, that assumes the aggressive party has any genuine interest in eg. science, evidence, fairness, liberty and the general development of the species... I assure you, they do not. <br /><br />If they did, their first step might be to recognize that the planet is already hopelessly overcrowded by H. Sapiens. And nothing is gonna bring about total catastrophe sooner than unrestricted fucking. The solution is very simple, very safe, and numerous options are readily available in all pharmacies. Yet politically &amp; religiously, spurious arguments are frequently rolled out to dissuade their use (see a pattern yet?), not just in the developed world but crucially, throughout the developing world, where unrestricted fucking is a semi-successful strategy for dealing with chronic childhood mortality.<br /><br />Why would our so-called leaders be so wedded to a policy so clearly short-sighted? Because in the run up to our demise, your markets get ever bigger, the competition for your assets &amp; resources grows more intense, and labor becomes ever cheaper, because there are lots more people cheaper to hire than you. So if you&#039;re running a MegaCorp, that translates as spectacular guaranteed gains, all the way up until the bird-flu zombie apocalypse water wars or whatever finally does for us. <br /><br />God forbid any sort of critical mass of enlightened people arise before then, probably forms a part of their fervent prayers each night.<br /><br />And in the short term, how helpful that any potentially traitorous enlightened or perceptive types are likely to have a criminal charge (or 10) hanging over them, to be prosecuted at will.<br /><br />Traditionally, the Law was assumed to have failed when large numbers of citizens were inadvertently breaking it. The Law was then rewritten to take account of development. This process appears to have stalled, and we can now see that much legislation is designed to actively include as many peaceful, innocent civilians as possible, obviously &quot;just in case&quot;.<br /><br />Make of this what you will.<br /><br />Have a great day y&#039;all&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				It is really a war on the lower classes.. People who cant afford the slick lawyers .. People who don&#039;t have health care...people who have to find away to get thru the day with chronic pain.. <br /><br />I reading about how there has been massive amounts of inconsistency in the sentencing of people who were found guilty of selling / trafficking LSD&nbsp; ... Seem the US government picks your sentence&nbsp; based on weight! YES weight.. and I do not mean the weight of just the LSD here.. If you have 50 hits on blotter paper you will get a shorter sentence then having 50 hits on sugar cubes....take it s step further and someone who puts LSD on candies and such will have in even longer sentence.. WHY? Because the paper weighs the least... and the Candy would weigh the most.. STUPID!! How does this even make sense?&nbsp; ???&nbsp;

				Slightly naive to think that the creation of SR is the ultimate conclusion of the failure of the war on drugs. SR is just an example of humans using tools to create an innovative solution to a problem that has existed for a very long time and then using it in an opportunistic way to make a lot of money. Also on reflection with the technology that&#039;s around today I think it was inevitable that something like that would have been created by someone, didn&#039;t have to be DPR although kudos to him for being the first one out the gate.

				It&#039;s not a war on drugs as much as it is a war with drugs. Government drugs&nbsp; (heroin, Cocaine, Pharmaceuticals) come into the country with the blessings of Government, then the people , the Citizens, of that country are arrested for the possessing the drugs that are brought in. A war against the people.<br />&nbsp;The drugs that are enlightening are the ones the Governments war against (LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA etc...) . They make the Dumb you down drugs available and take the intelligence drugs away

				By keeping drugs illegal, the fools of the corporate government complex keep drug profits high, and the material acquisitions collected by the gov. as part of their confiscation efforts are controlled by the corporations (ie J.P. Morgan-Chase). Only the people are brought to ruin.<br />&nbsp;There is only one consciousness, if ANYTHING was forbade by God, it would not be FUN!!!

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I am fascinated by the depth of these responses. Many thanks to everyone.<br />&nbsp;I suppose what I was getting at, is rather than claiming SR to be the be all and end all of the prohibition of drugs in our society at this very moment in history, was that its very existence makes for an example of a model of what the future must now hold in relation to the future trade in drugs for the developed world. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So far, SR has proved unstoppable and serves as a revolutionary example of what happens when &#039;we, the people&#039; demand liberty in the face of perceived unjust laws and set up a stronghold in which anarchism takes hold and proves by the successes of its actual functionality the inherent right of those involved in it to do what they are doing, despite the continuing perceived &#039;prohibition&#039; that is portrayed within the mass media, and proliferated by those with the most to gain from keeping these drugs illegal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As one of the generous contributors to this forum mentioned, when the regulators of our societal administrative facility abandon their responsibilities to alter laws according to the desires of the general populace, with that refusal they abandon their duty of care for which they are duly elected to represent and so their validity as rulers and the value of their laws becomes null and void.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure that&#039;s what anyone who seriously sells illegal drugs for a living must see as a base rationale, whether consciously perceived or not. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The governments of the world have used poverty to enslave the disaffected minority ethnic groups in western (and other) societies and so the act of retaliation by those minorities is to use those prohibitive&nbsp; laws of the unjust governments as a weapon of retaliation to survive financially. Even to profit and flourish to the greater or lesser degree of their capabilities.<br />But it is weapon that has been forced into their slave like hands and they are still serving the greater needs of those governments when those governments directly profit from the existence and maintenance of the illegal drug trade.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To criminalize a vast section of one&#039;s own society, to refuse proper medical treatment to those who are caught in the&nbsp; destruction of uncontrollable addiction to a particular substance, and then to make clandestine business deals to keep these products illegal, all for the purpose of taking a financial profit from the production and distribution of those drugs is the cruelest act of terrorism the governing body of any so-called &#039;democracy&#039; can perpetrate upon it&#039;s people. <br />&nbsp; I used to wonder whether representative government deliberately utilizes tools such as drug prohibition to keep those individuals within their jurisprudence whose minds questioned and challenged the validity of the actual structures of the governmental authority to keep those substances illegal as a type of &#039;secret weapon&#039; to actually kill off those citizens through an enforced ignorance leading to overdose, destitution, disease and effective eradication but now I do not wonder. I know that there are those who do this very thing and they do it with mean pride.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If every illegal drug on earth was made legal tomorrow morning the economic survival of our society would be finished and so there must be a transition to regulation that is structured and thought out. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking of the notion that the SR, small step as it may be in the face of every street corner dealer in the world&#039;s daily vending rate, might actually be a signifier to the governments of the world that the time has come to consider the implications of this potentially enormous, quantum leap, society changing, unstoppable force and to decide how the transition to that model of decriminalization and regulation might be made before it became once again impossible. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As DPR has been quoted as stating on the SR Wikipedia entry, &#039;...the die has been cast and we shall see how they lie...&#039;<br />The value of the BTC is one of the numbers in the total sum of that amount. <br />Hang on, someone&#039;s knocking at the front door, aw shit! It&#039;s the cops...<br />

				It&#039;s evidence that can be pointed to that shows the pure futility of trying to control the drug market. Fantastic quote &#039;if you can&#039;t control drugs in a high security prison, how can you control them in a city?&#039; <br />The war on drugs will truly be lost when we open dialogues on legalization and decriminalization, which I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see in the next few decades!

				War on Drugs has just begun. The Road has made the war more profitable than anytime in history. We have now enabled our government leaders and law enforcement to capture richer, more intelligent &quot;criminals&quot;. That means there will be more incentive to capture American (and foreign) entrepreneurs. Whether they are violent offenders or not, the war will only escalate from here. It is the fall of Rome all over again. Senators will have control over armies. Look at California, for instance. Who is running the government? Who is taking over? How is it changing because of the cannabis &quot;epidemic&quot;--or economic recovery package for the common man... instead of corporate bankers and insurance fraudsters? People vs. Fraudsters... that&#039;s what the Drug War is.<br /><br />It&#039;s the fucking American Revolution in a Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Cycle. An endless loop of history. People, honest and hard-working, are fighting the government. Do you know that in British history, the American Revolution was but a small chapter... and it fell under the category of &quot;terrorism&quot;. How tyrannical are we going to allow the government become?<br /><br />You do realize that the War on Drugs can not fuel enough of the financial-political cycle to change the rules, right? People can take over--without use of arms--by using economic and legal means.

				There&#039;s another documentary I&#039;d recommend besides &quot;The House I Live In&quot; which is called &quot;Breaking the taboo&quot;. Two great approaches about the issue, both of them equally heart-wrenching.<br /><br />I was tripping on 2c-b last month in a concert having the time of my life, experiencing my senses in full capacity, absorbing the music and life all around, and suddenly I realized that what I was doing was illegal. I started to laugh just from the absurdity of it, how they systematically deny these kinds of experiences to an entire population of human beings. I think of SR as the evidence of how an open and legal drug market would be, well-educated, with the freedom of choice not separated from the responsibility that comes with it. The war on drugs is entirely another business, as it has nothing to do with the individuals nor the substances, but with maintaining an alienated society.

				Depends on your metric of success for the War on Drugs.<br /><br />If your success is to stop the intelligent working classes and the affluent middle classes from discreetly getting high, the war is a failure.<br /><br />If the goal of your war on drugs, however, is to permanently imprison a very large proportion of black and Hispanic men then it has been a resounding fucking success.<br />

				The war on drugs is never lost. Because as long as people are imprisoned, the peopled behind the war earn money, even if 99% get the drugs they want and need. The debate is practically &quot;should we stop imprisoning people to earn money?&quot; The answer will be &#039;no&#039; until the general public realizes what is going on, that they don&#039;t need babysitters, that they cannot rightfully control other people, and that the war on drugs doesn&#039;t protect anyone.

I&#039;ll check back more often again to the forum because reading interesting threads like this one makes me feel so whole with the world again.<br />It enables me to connect with the kind of like minded people of which I have met more here than in my entire RL.
