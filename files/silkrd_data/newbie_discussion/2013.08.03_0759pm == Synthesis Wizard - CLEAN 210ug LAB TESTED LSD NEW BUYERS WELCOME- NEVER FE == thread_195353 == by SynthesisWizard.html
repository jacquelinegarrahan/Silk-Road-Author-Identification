				Hello all, SynthesisWizard Here. <br />I may be a new vendor But i am not new to the road, Not one little bit ;) I am 100% willing to work with all new buyers and will treat everyone the same, regardless of their stats.<br />I will be stocking LSD to start off with, It will be clean potent and lab tested . I shall also be sending the avengers a tab to test when it arrives, So keep an eye out for that. <br />There will be High Grade Marijuana coming alongside not too long after, I am currently waiting on an old associate to finish growing his plants and then they will be availaible for purchase. All bud will be bone dry, cured and of the highest quality. <br /><br />I will only be shipping domestically within the UK to begin with but hope to expand not long after. <br /><br />I shall be getting my stock Hopefully within the next fortnight so become a fan and keep an eye out for My listings.<br />There will be sample availaible to trusted reviewers with good scores. <br /><br />Hope to see you all around soon ;)<br />SynthesisWizard<br /><br />Vendor Page here.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ec58f1444d

				Thread seems to be have been buried under the mass piles of junk in the newbie forum so I thought I would ressurrect it. <br />Any newbie buyers are free to order from me, And you DO NOT have to FE , EVER. I have some of THE best acid on Sr and feel free to check it out. <br />Please read the terms and conditions on my profile before ordering, And if you have any questions regarding your security, PGP or anything drop me a message and I would be glad to help.<br /><br />SynthesisWizard

				I forgot to say, Asides from everyone being welcome and never having to FE. I may be going on a business trip at the end of the month in which time I am not sure how often I will be able to check in so get them while you can :)<br /><br />The dalai lamas are laid with white or fluff crystal and are extremely strong and clean acid , That alongside a heavy 210ug dose makes for an excellent trip which is very strong visually and makes for great spiritual experiences.<br /><br />Regards
