				sites like mtgox and preev will tell you the current value of a bitcoin, but that wont be the exact price you pay for it as most places that sell bitcoins will charge a fee for the transaction. Its about $73 USD right now. <br /><br />Try searching the forums for the name of the company you want to buy bitcoins from, there will probably be some reviews on them.

				The rate fluctuation isn&#039;t going to affect you as a buyer unless you are holding on to your btc for extended periods of time.

				Does anyone know how the value of BTC&#039;s has changed for the past few months? Does the price ever go down? I mostly just don&#039;t want to buy some and have the price exchange plummet

				if you goto mtgox you see the charts and how its fluctuated. EG I got mine when they were $30 and now they are $70. It crashed a while back but has gone way up since then. It&#039;s not really something that you can predict imo but I dont think personally that it will crash hugely and and unexpectedly, lots of demand atm. <br /><br />and thanks for the (imaginary) 1+ hopoffporfavor :D I still cant give karma either.
