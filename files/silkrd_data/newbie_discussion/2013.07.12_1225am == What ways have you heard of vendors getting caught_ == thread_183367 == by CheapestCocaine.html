				Authorities tracing fingerprints? Looking into the camera footage at the time the suspect was delivering the package? Snitches?<br /><br />List them all!

				Don&#039;t use a return address. Only ship anonymously (don&#039;t ship to your friends, have heard stories about people ratting on their blood brother). Make drops at different boxes, don&#039;t keep using the same one week by week. Use stealthy packaging. I feel like there is a greater risk receiving product through the mail, correct me if I&#039;m wrong on this though.

				Luckily, my fingerprints are not in any system. At least not yet. ;)<br /><br />... At least not to my knowledge. I may have engaged in the practice of fingerpainting as a child, so if any akin documentation exists, then who knows...

Just make sure it&#039;s not your actual return address.

				It seems that the risk is higher to the buyer than the Vendor. But imo it&#039;s up to Vendors to keep their customers as safe as possible.<br /><br />Most Vendor busts I&#039;ve heard about were related to their local activity (dealing IRL, friends ratting them out etc)<br /><br />Green Inc

				I read one post of a vendor being turned in by one of his workers, who was caught for something or other. LE found SR and PGP codes on his system. Make sure you use a mobile USB TAILS system, so that that you can hide/destroy it easily if they do come knocking, and they won&#039;t have shit on you.<br />Fucking snitches.

I had two friends who got caught, not for drugs but for selling forgeries. With the word-to-mouth, one&#039;s business expanded until the friend of a friend of a friend (etc.) who heard about him was an undercover cop. The other one got ratted out by a friend after this fckin snitch got arrested for possession.<br />One&#039;s never too careful.

				Honestly the only way I could see a vendor getting caught would be.... To accept some form of payment outside of SR. Bragging/talking to people he or she &quot;trust&quot;(sadly alot of people get in trouble by family and friends that want to save their own asses).
