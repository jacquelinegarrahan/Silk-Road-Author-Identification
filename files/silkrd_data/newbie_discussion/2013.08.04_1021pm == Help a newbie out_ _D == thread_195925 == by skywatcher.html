				I&#039;m a newbie too! I did go and read the Wikipedia article, then followed the links there, bitcoins.org seemed like a good place to learn and has links to various ways to purchase.<br />Good luck, this bitcoins thing is complicated!

But i think, there is two ways: 1- BTC go direct to your SR account. I don&#039;t know how you can reach it, you have to find the &quot;right place&quot; for it. 2- BTC go direct to your account, wich you must have &quot;in the place&quot;, where you buy it. Then i can make a transfer to SR. I used the way2.

				I am not necessarily the poster child for being thorough but I would suggest you doing the foot work for yourself, in feeling how you do now myself at one time. Making sure that you are anonymous is important but not the most important thing. It can&#039;t hurt to be more thorough than necessary.&nbsp; I used virwox.com on the clearnet...there are fees. but It was the fastest simplest way. All of the other sights are rigorous and most only accept from certain &quot;Wallets&quot; on the clearnet. Most of these wallets are on the fritz or aren&#039;t available in all countries I.E. Paygo for the US.

				Thanks for the replies guys i havn&#039;t been so hadn&#039;t realised people had written on here. Looking back on the thread I was asking to be spoon fed the info which is annoying for you guys I can imagine, but I am pretty eager to start purchasing etc.. Let the research continue!

				Welcome to the forums, hope you enjoy your stay. As Mantzoukas stated in his post, there is tons of information on here that is highly beneficial. Even if you chose not to engage yourself in some topics, make sure you read everything that people have to offer here.<br /><br />To learn more about Bitcoin, I&#039;d advise checking out the forum bitcointalk.org (CLEARNET WARNING). There is a wealth of information on there. There is even a section for exchangers of Bitcoin. I&#039;m sure you will find what you are looking for on there.<br /><br />If you choose to use an exchanger on there, make sure they have good reputation. Always use discretion when making a transaction, just like you would on any other site.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing some quality posts from you in the future! Best of luck.

				I set up an account with coinbase and its been pretty straight forward. Buy some BTC, wait for it to clear, copy and paste your SR wallet address in your SR account info and send. Takes about 4 or 5 business days this way but it wasn&#039;t very difficult. This definitely isn&#039;t the most anonymous way to do it but I have a hard time believing LE is going to invest the resources to trace me and bust me for buying a couple tabs. Then again it&#039;s this kind of apathy that leaves you exposed when shit goes down...
