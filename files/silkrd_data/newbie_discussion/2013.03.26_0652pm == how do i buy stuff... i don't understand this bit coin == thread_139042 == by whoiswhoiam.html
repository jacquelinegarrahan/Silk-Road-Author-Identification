				There are plenty of tutorials on how to buy stuff if you know where to look. Simply just Google &quot;how to use the Silk Road anonymous market place&quot; and you&#039;re bound to come up with something. There&#039;s even a wiki on the actual site somewhere that will give you some idea on how to get you started as well as a buyers guide in the forums, just give it a search and someone is bound to have more detailed answer for you.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				Depends what country you&#039;re in, but as far as I know you can&#039;t buy btc with paypal. I could be wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here in the UK you buy btc from Blockchain via the Barclay&#039;s Pingit app, or you can buy coins with cash from a vendor at SR. BitcoinsUK is his name.<br /><br />Outside of the UK, I&#039;ve no idea. But there is a wealth of knowledge of&nbsp; this subject in the boards. Just search. No-one is gonna walk you through it entirely. We all had to work it out, you have to as-well. lol :p<br /><br />Also, search the SR wiki. Loads of info on there.

				Remove your email from the OP for starters.<br /><br />You are not ready to buy anything yet, you need to thoroughly read through the forums and the wiki to ensure you understand how to use SR. You can not get bitcoins via paypal. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />

				Yeah, remove your Gmail address. Asap.<br /><br />I just Googled your address and I now know your name, at least three sites you&#039;ve posted on, as-well as your Twitter and FB presence.<br /><br />All that is just on the first page of Google.<br /><br />If you&#039;re gonna buy illegal drugs from an anonymous site, for the love of god, PLEASE don&#039;t use info that could be used to find out who you are. This opens you up to all kinds of issues, and renders the anonymity that SR provides, useless.<br /><br />Get yourself a tormail account instead. <br /><br />

				You don&#039;t need email to use the road. You **DO** need to do your homework. Relax, swot up, and when you feel like you know what you&#039;re doing come back.

				I just edited the OP and a quote of the OP to remove his gmail address.<br /><br />OP - you need to do a LOT more reading and research prior to purchasing anything here.&nbsp; The fact that you posted your personal email address publicly in this forum is a giant, giant red flag that you are not ready to place an order yet.
