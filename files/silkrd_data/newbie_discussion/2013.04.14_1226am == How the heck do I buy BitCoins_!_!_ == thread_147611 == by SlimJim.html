				Hi Guys,<br /><br />as you can most likely tell I&#039;m totally new here. I&#039;ve found the SR and now want to get hold of some bitcoins so I can buy stuff. Everywhere I try it&#039;s just sooooooooooo flippin complicated, like I know it&#039;s important to stay safe etc but it could be easier somehow or even if there was a tutorial! Anywho.....any advice from anyone would be gratefully appreciated<br /><br />

				Honestly if it&#039;s too difficult then you shouldn&#039;t be here. You need to make sure that you comp is protected and you&#039;re using Tor. Do that first. Then read the forums. There is a guide on here maybe under security that shows you how to use SR anonymously so do a search for that and follow it the best you can. If you can try to use Tails OS on a live USB. Always use PGP when ordering. When it comes to bitcoins if you can try bitfloor and make a cash deposit to the bank. Watch out with a title like this in your first post b/c it&#039;s just screaming out that you want to be scammed. Don&#039;t listen to anyone that tries to sell you coins personally b/c you will get screwed. Just be patient and read. If it&#039;s too hard for you to do that then you probably have no business buying product here.

				I guess it was a bit bait......I guess just hearing that it&#039;s not easy makes me feel better that other people have come across these problems too. The moment I joined up here I got a message offering me coins, I might be a Noob but I&#039;m not completely stupid!<br /><br />As for anonymity......getting Tor was the first thing I did. I&#039;m still obviously careful and don&#039;t think this makes me super clever, you&#039;ve always gotta be one step ahead&nbsp; ;)

				bit harsh there imo anonypunk<br /><br />The OP does come across as a bit green, which Mr OP is defo not the picture you want to be painting of yourself if you don&#039;t wanna alert the sharks. Think a bit before hitting post mate.(says he who&#039;s been posting stoned tonight)<br /><br />however, it&#039;s not ananypunk&#039;s business who is on the forums or SR. T bitcoin business is pretty difficult to fathom at first, but can be grasped with a few (quite a few) hours reading. The OP could turn out to be a top roader, how&#039;s about some encouragement from the older members instead of flaming the newbies, pah<br /><br /><br /><br />

				the easiest, most anonymous and quickest way is to check out www.localbitcoins.com and find someone in your area. find someone who isn&#039;t charging too much, contact them, meet them IN PERSON with your cash and make sure the transaction is recorded on the site. it costs $0 to join, you do not need anything to be verified and they will take care of the transaction for you.&nbsp; once you have the coins in your localbitcoins.com wallet, you can transfer them to SR or anywhere else you want.<br /><br />my experience with localbitcoins.com:<br /><br />i found a guy who was selling @ $131 when btcs were on their steady climb last week - which was like $10 more than what they were at on MtGox. i contacted him by text and we met at a coffee shop in town. the transaction was initiated by me online so the btc price was locked in right when i decided to buy, which is another cool thing about the site. we met at the coffee shop, i saw him complete the transaction on his cell phone, i got a confirmation email on my cell phone informing me of the new coins i had and the deal was done, i gave him the cash and we parted ways. <br /><br />i would not use western union or do a random bank transfer to another country because the fees are outrageous - unless you live in an un-populated area, there WILL be someone nearby who is trying to sell coins for cash. its the safest and quickest way of getting btcs

				Have you gotten your bitcoin address with SR? I like BitInstant you can always google it but you can go to Walmart or lots of other places to do it and it can go to Mt.Gox or straight to SR. Yup not easy, and with good reason. I don&#039;t think I would ever meet anyone at a coffee shop, that would make me a bit nervous. But that is me

				You can also look at using something like bitfloor. Signup with a anon email. You can then create a deposit slip and go to a Bank of America, with the deposit slip and money and they will do the transaction for you. I did bitfloor thru cap1 360, then I will move it to bitfog so it get lost in transaction, then move it to my SR wallet. Bam, then buy. It&#039;s not hard, but does take time. Figure a few days at the least. And, don&#039;t forget to use PGP whenever you send emails. <br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I can vouch for cryptocurrent.com and they have a few banks setup to deposit with.&nbsp; Or you can do cash by mail with a $300 minimum and they&#039;ll prepay an overnight shipping slip for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s the easiest method I&#039;ve found that doesn&#039;t make you signup, login, or give names.

				You must be using tor already if you are accessing this area of the intranet. I will break it down step by step for ya. First open a www.Dwolla.com account and link it with your bank account and verify your identity and save all of your information. Second you want to open a www.Mty.Gox.com account to use as both your wallet and way to buy bitcoins. You will have to verify your identity again with MT.Gox. You will then have a wallet and a bitcoin address and you can buy and sell bitcoins on Mt.gox or send them to you SR address. <br /><br />The other way is bitinstant. It is very easy. go to www.bitinstant.com and follow the instructions on the screen and go to your local money-gram and use a bill pay to send money through bitinstant/zipzap directly to your SR address

				Im aware of but id be real careful when doing MP vs BTC as myself and several other users got beat by the same seller (seems SR staff has taken care of that seller).<br />Though this was just one incident, with one seller, and its expected that not all are going to be honest . (Though to my surprise the large majority SR is honest.)<br /><br /><br />Tough lesson to learn but its pushed me to look into other methods of obtaining btc

				Good luck, and just so you know if you do BitInstant to your SR account it does take a while so don&#039;t think you will get home from Walmart and place an order. It takes about 12 hours. If you go through Mt Gox, first your money has to get there, doesn&#039;t take long, then you have to buy coins, then you have to transfer to SR so it takes about the same amout of time but you are in more control of your exchange rate but will get more fees when you transfer from Mt.Gox to SR

				Using BitInstant is a very good way of procuring bitcoins for those in the US.<br />It goes without saying that one may be best off using fake information when funding though Bitinstant. I personally wouldn&#039;t feel secure trasferring straight from Bitinstant to SR, but everyone has their own risk tolerance. I&#039;d rather move the funds through an additional wallet, then on to SR.<br /><br />If you use bit instant, go to Wal-Mart. They are the least likely to ask questions. Fill out the Moneygram form in advance, and remember your info!<br /><br />Oh, if you&#039;re using fake info on Bitinstant, be sure to go to an anonymous wireless access point to get the payment slip. It will work through TOR, but your fake info will possibly get flagged for fraud sooner, and you&#039;ll have to make up new fake info. (Unless you just wanna do that every time anyway)<br /><br />I know it&#039;s intimidating at first, but you can do it. Take your time, and work through it.

				I forgot to add that it does take time for the transaction to move through the system from Bitinstant to your chosen address. A valuable tool for tracking the progress of the transaction is blockchain.info<br /><br />There is a place where you can paste in the bitcoin address you are transferring to, and it will show you the progress of the trasaction. In general, you need at least 6 confirmations on blockchain.info for the bitcoins to be in the destination wallet.
