				My first order off the road was with Juno. I&#039;d never done G before, and was hoping to be able to use it as somewhat of a replacement for alcohol as alcohol makes me sick for weeks with strep throat like symptoms -- all kinds too. Transaction wise, Juno was perfect. It came very fast and discreetly packaged. His little stealth trick was funny too. Purity wise, everything I&#039;ve read tells me its great.<br /><br />For me personally, GHB isnt really my thing for going out, so I likely wont be buying it again for that, but its pretty awesome for sleep. I have insomnia really really badly, and when I take a large dose of G, its almost kind of scary. Its like I can feel myself getting very rapidly fucked up and the road is inevitably leading towards knockout. Great to have when you really need some quality sleep, apparently its great for sleep anyways.<br /><br />Juno is the man, just wanted to put it out there.

				I&#039;ve also had the pleasure of ordering from Juno and he&#039;s def a great vendor. If I were you I would suggest trying 1,4b. It lasts longer, produces more of a &quot;drunk&quot; feeling and gives amazing full body throbbing tingles :-*. The aphrodisiac qualities to 1,4b makes you feel like sensuality is oozing out of your every pore. GHB really didn&#039;t come close to producing the erotic body high that 1,4b does.<br /><br />I ordered 1,4b first before GHB was available domestically and have found like most people that dosing has to be done very carefully. Also, never mix the two! Even though I knew better a few weeks ago I nearly killed myself by taking over 3 g GHB and 2.5 ml 1,4. Yeah.....it was not pretty! The stupidity of that day still amazes me uhh.<br /><br />The other drawback to 1,4b (at least for me personally) is the slight nausea. I&#039;m seriously the biggest puss when it comes to nausea. To remedy this I usually pop a Phenergan or Compazine before I dose. Plugging also helps (but not eliminates) with stomach discomfort, but extreme caution has to be taken as overdosing is more likely via this ROA.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Rereading my post makes 1,4 seem Ã¼ber dangerous (which it can be), but I believe like with any drug, it can be safely used in moderation. My overdose was a result of sheer stupidity and an incurable go-big-or-go-home attitude. Sorry for the long post! I just really love sharing my experience with 1,4b because it&#039;s the first drug that really &quot;clicked&quot; with me mentally and physically.<br />

				posting a review for Juno&#039;s GHB since I finally got around to testing with it<br /><br />after measuring all the powder, it came to be 10% more than the amount i ordered. thanks and kudos to juno for that<br /><br />since this is my first time experimenting with GHB, i followed advice and started with a low dose and worked my way up.&nbsp; i should state that i typically have high tolerance to a lot of things but alcohol and caffeine (the legal stuff) for some reason<br /><br />0:00 took 0.5g in some water<br />0:30 felt nothing so redosed another 0.5g in water<br />1:00 still felt nothing so redosed another 0.5g in water<br />1:30 starting to feel something. slight headache. a bit wobbly. it indeed was like i had a drink or two but without the other effects of alcohol. substance was definitely active<br />2:30 feeling back to baseline<br /><br />that was uneventful but it was a test of my reaction to ghb so that&#039;s ok.<br /><br />reading around, i hear ghb mixes well during the come down of a molly roll. i took 1g of ghb about 3-4 hours into my molly roll. keep in mind that i felt nothing with 1g during my experimentation. i can&#039;t honestly say the ghb helped my roll but i did stay happy and was able3 to get to sleep<br /><br />in conclusion the substance seems active but i haven&#039;t found my sweet spot yet. but since i got a 10% bonus, i can keep experimenting and will let you guys know what happens when i start at 1.5 and boost up to 2.5

				i promised to try more so here&#039;s review number 2:<br /><br />since my first try getting to 1.5g was relatively uneventful, i started with 1.5g this time<br /><br />0:00 took 1.5g in about 300ml of water. tasted salty as expected<br />0:30 feeling a bit woozy. kind of like i&#039;ve had a drink or two. redosed another 0.5g<br />1:00 still feeling woozy. like i&#039;ve had another drink since 30 minutes ago. redosed another 0.5g<br />1:30 feeling goodly gone. not like pass out but very disoriented but still having a good time. sort of like taking medium dose benzo but without any of the tiredness. slight pounding headache<br />2:30 mostly worn off. things still a bit wobbly<br />4:00 completely back to normal now<br /><br />so i think my sweet spot is about 2-2.5g. product is definitely active and because of juno&#039;s generosity i&#039;ve been able to experiment with it a good mount. it definitely mimics alcohol but without most of the other side effects of alcohol. i can see how it can be fun by itself in a social setting. i&#039;ll probably try 1.5g of it at the end of my next molly roll and see what happens
