				I have been on the silk road for a couple years now and have spent hundreds of bitcoins, I have recently found my new go to guy for the original formulat OC type oxycontin(the best oxycodone money can buy). All Drugs UK has the best service par non. He messaged me almost as quickly as I placed my order and told me that he is preparing my order for shipment and that it will be shipped out as soon as possible. Not only did it arrive in less than a week from the UK to the US, it was packaged in such a way that there was no way that the pills could get crushed or would ever get stopped by customs. The best thing was the price he doesn&#039;t over charge like other sellers and offers the best price for oxy on the entire silk road. All in all All Drugs UK has the best service, prices, and shipping for oxycontin on the silk road!!

				Anytime bro!! I&#039;m glad to see a seller that actually cares about his customers feedback and shows it with some of the best prices here on silk road. Most sellers are just trying to squeeze out the most bitcoins they can from as many people as they can.

				Hi there good people of SR, Thanks again &quot;Spankymac&quot; for the thread. We are looking at raffling off a box of 56x 10mg Oxycontin OC type, And was wondering if anyone had any <br />thoughts on this? IE, The best and most fairest way forward, Or if you would buy a ticket and if so, for what price? All comments are welcome. Peace &amp; Goodwill
