				I think, considering the scale of this attach, a list should be made with details of how to contact sellers outside of SR, just so that the whole network is not lost.<br /><br />I recommend that, as vendors have done one their pages, detailing contact information for when SR is down, a thread should be made with these details, posted by the vendors themselves (so that nobody can post fake details to scam) so that at least contact can be maintained, and if you&#039;ve worked with these people before enough in the past to trust an FE, then there should be no problem with this, until these cunts (sorry to use the word, but they really are) have been eliminated. Maybe somebody with a little more power than me on these forums should set up a MEGATHREAD for contact details.<br /><br />Wish I could do it myself, but apparently spending $20,000 on SR doesn&#039;t give me the privilege to post in anything but the newbie forum. I think this is important, as you know that the next attack will be on the forums, and then contact is lost completely. There needs to be a system of communication that is inextinguishable. I hope somebody can move this to a forum that is more read, because I think it is important to act quickly in this regard.

				I only have one vendor&#039;s tormail addy, but honestly, I would give it a little more time for a fix before we all rush out and try to work around the system.

				There is already a thread suggesting this, and it looks like there have been numerous threads before. The thing is people don&#039;t want to do business with &#039;ships in the dark&#039;. If they already know someone enough to trust them, then they probably have their email address already.&nbsp; <br /><br />This could only really help with sales in progress. But then there isn&#039;t that much an email address will help with. The money is in escrow and there isn&#039;t a way (without the site or previous trust) to verify that you are talking to the right person. I guess there is some small use case in helping with order details, but that is still pretty limited given the lack of trust.

				Agreed, but it&#039;s like hard-disk, it&#039;s always better to have a backup in-case things go tits up. SR will be fine imo, there&#039;s only so long that people are going to keep up a DDoS, but what if one day it&#039;s not? It would be so useful just to have this list available in-case one day we aren&#039;t going to be so lucky, and beat this thing (as we KNOW the Dread Pirate and his team will!). Just a thought. I&#039;ve messaged a few suppliers here on the forum asking for contact details, and I suggest other people do the same. Better safe than sorry.

But I do recommend people start doing this.<br /><br />ALso I disagree, as I say, I&#039;ve spent $20000 at least, and I haven&#039;t got a single Tormail addy, or even a Tormail account, SR has worked up until now, so I never saw the need, and I&#039;m sure many are in the same boat as me..

				I think I&#039;m going to message DPR, and suggest the situation, because I think that a lot of people are going to be in the same situation, and though I don&#039;t personally have any money riding on it at the moment, there are definitely people I have strong business relationships with, that I would like to keep in contact with. and am in need of contact details as soon as possible.<br /><br />I disagree that people will have all the details saved of their suppliers, just as SR is such an effective system, and kudos to DPR for making something so effective, but I have everything memorized, and have nothing linking me to any illegal activity, I like all the information I need to access the people i need contact with stored in my brain (which has been quite a downfall in this situation), but which obviously seemed the safest way, and I&#039;m sure other people are the same.<br /><br />I know DPR is a busy man, so I&#039;ll keep it short, there are important things he is doing at the moment.

				Bumping this, as I think it needs more discussion, I have already contacted some reputable suppliers, and got some details. I think everyone with suppliers they trust with FE should be doing the same.

				Bumping this again, as I think it has been overlooked, although the longer SR is down, the more important it becomes.
