				Hey Everyone. Just received my first orders today (I actually ordered 2 items), and I can honestly say the transaction and the products were outstanding in every way. BUT I SWEAR TO GOD....it took me a Week to figure out the whole Bitcoin thing....I had never heard the word before; I read in this forum, on wiki, did general internet searches, and it just seemed really complex to me (even though I&#039;m certified in Web Development). Because I live in a small town and did not want to go to the local CVS or Grocery store. I wanted Bitcoins, and I wanted them FAST, Easy and Online. Well after about a week of torturing myself about it, a very simple thing occurred to me....EBAY! Ebay has everything! (Something I should have known, being that I dabble a bit in selling on Ebay). Well, I was right, there were sellers of Bitcoins on Ebay. I think I paid a little bit more than market for them, but the procedure was very painless and the seller walked me right through it. I had the Bitcoins within an hour of purchasing them. Hope this will help someone out there who is struggling with the same issue. <br /><br />Seeking Personal and Global Truth,<br />CC

				People that sell BTc on eBay are too brave for their own good. It seems like such easy money, buying BTC on an exchange and selling them for a big premium on the Bay, until you get your first customer complaining via paypal that their account was hacked. eBay and Paypal are notoriously seller friendly, so I caution any BTc merchants that eBay is not a good idea. I&#039;m stuck with a Paypal account I can&#039;t use until I clear up the negative balance that resulted from a BTc sale that I fulfilled in good faith. FWIW, the person that scammed me also scammed at least 3 other people selling BTC on eBay.

If you have any better ideas, I&#039;m certainly open. I did set up an account with Coinbase, but having trouble verifying my bank account. They never deposit the small amount I have to identify.....so any help you can give me that&#039;s not over the top technical, I would appreciate it!

				localbitcoins.com is the less hassle free global BTC exchange if you don&#039;t care too much about anonymity (and if you care you can always buy on a face to face transaction).<br />It is also very difficult to be scammed there since you are in escrow (if naturally you don&#039;t buy face to face).<br /><br />Then there are many other fast and reliable methods that depends on where you live. If you are in the US BlueSkyTraders, if you are in the UK there&#039;s bitcoinbargain.uk, etc. etc.<br />Plus there are&nbsp; also forums as bitcointalk.org dedicated to BTC where you can find people that buy/sell them.<br /><br />Many options, and all of these I would trust more than eBay personally (especially as a seller).

				Coinbase is fucking ridiculous.&nbsp; It takes TWO WEEKS to set up an account and get coins into said account.&nbsp; A week of verifying that the bank account you&#039;re using is yours, then another week for your deposit to clear.<br /><br />Seriously, why the hell does it take an entire week for your deposit to go through?&nbsp; I think they just wanna float your money for as long as possible.
