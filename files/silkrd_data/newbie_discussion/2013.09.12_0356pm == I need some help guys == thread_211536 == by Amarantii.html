				Sorry, didn&#039;t know it was against the rules. My bad. Moderators, please lock this thread hehe ;D<br /><br />Edit: Lol, I just saw that you can lock your own topic. I feel so dumb after asking mods to lock the topic for me. Never seen this on other forums before.

				Yes you are breaking a rule, a rule that might get your account banned.<br /><br />You need a vendors account to sell/trade anything on these forums, trying to do so without one will result in your account being deleted.<br /><br />And yes you are begging, nothing wrong with asking for some help, why not try the spare coins thread for a small btc loan? it&#039;s in off topic.

Wasn&#039;t my intention to break a rule. I couldn&#039;t find where the rules are posted. And I don&#039;t think people will loan me 0.4 btc. I will take a look at the thread but I don&#039;t expect to be trusted enough for a loan. I figure there&#039;s interest as well.

But this memory program is really good, I&#039;m using it myself. Can&#039;t vouch for the other programs. And I wasn&#039;t trying to dress it up as begging lol. I was genuinly trying to offer the memory program in return for some btc, but seeing as it is against the rules I will call it off. I don&#039;t beg lol, I can buy bitcoins myself but the banks are closed right now, and tomorrow I won&#039;t be able to transfer money and the holiday is coming up after that. So I cannot buy btc during this entire week and I don&#039;t have an online bank which I can use to transfer some money to my btc wallet.<br />And I need 0.4 btc today anyway lol. Are there any sites where you can answer some surveys and get some bitcoins? I doubt I can manage to complete surveys and earn 0.4 btc in one day but if I can find several survey sites, like 10 - 12 of them, it&#039;s possible right? But they probably don&#039;t pay instantly so wouldn&#039;t be able to cash out even if I did reach 0.4 btc in one day.
