				Hello Brothers and Sisters,<br />I got some shit to tell ya&#039;ll.<br />First off, I wish to be known now as Ve$c0r.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had a much more prestigious nameS in the past, but that means nothing now other than to clarify I am not a newbie to the game both on the street and in the clouds(online), but I am new to tor; I haven&#039;t touched a computer for the last 5 years, just a lot of reading.<br />Now that i got a laptop I can experience TOR!<br />God bless this opportunity which allows all walks of life can talk freely across the globe with little expertise in networking, coding or ect.<br /><br />Just as a quick get to know me-<br />Getting a laptop might not sound like a big deal, but I&#039;m home free, or you might say homeless.&nbsp; So now its needless to say, I&#039;m broke, plus i fucked with tech most my life. I kinda wanted an escape.<br />I was a I.T. guy, mainly Data base admin, started selling drugs and made a ton of money.&nbsp; got cocky, got caught, did time, got out and only wanted to play my guitar and travel America.<br />So I live on the streets wrapped in a sleeping bag and tarp to disguise myself as a piece of garbage, lol-true!<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a good looking guy, good hygiene, but I said fuck the world, and pursued travel, sex and all around anarchy.<br />I been all over the USA, prefer around Los Angeles.<br />I Seen everything out here, or so I thought.<br /><br />CRAZY SHIT IS HAPPENING AND NOW ITS THE LAST STRAW!<br /><br />Quick notes:<br />---They lock the doors at every park bathroom at night then the news films People pissing in the streets.&nbsp; --- This upsets the yuppies makes them hate us.<br />---They ticket us for sleeping---WTF<br />---Cops make the gangs clear out the youngsters.&nbsp; I know, because the gangs tip me off and ask me to try to clear them before they have to beat the sleeping kids up--This is politics, but we try to protect the streets from 5-0, all of us here.<br />---I seen cops rape a Chica right on the beach....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />---Every Thursday the 5-0 rounds up the streets to a large park.&nbsp; TODAY I was near a large SFV park and I was Horrified.<br />---THEY ARE MOVING US TO AN UNDISCLOSED AREA!!!!<br />Probably justified by saying they had warrants on the people, which is true they&#039;re warrants for unpaid sleeping fines, violations.<br />---but its a misdemeanor to sleep in a car, check the new laws.<br /><br />And The list goes on.<br /><br /><br />I knew them, most are good people that fell onto the streets recently, they can&#039;t survive alone.&nbsp; I help all my fellow Americans, I share my last food with the hungry.&nbsp; I help elderly with bags and all sorts of love and street passion.&nbsp; - plus, they usually they tip well without asking, but hey! This is California KICKDOWNS. Code of the streets, we all know it here!<br />Then I smoke a blunt and hit on the wanna-be actresses.<br /><br />RECENTLY, old ladys have been the least of the street-veteran concerns including myself.<br />There&#039;s alot more, like ten times more fallen yuppies. Young, old, guys, girls, sober, fucked, or what-eve.&nbsp; Some of them go insane instantly.&nbsp; Many us old schools Home-Frees chose this life, They didn&#039;t.<br />&nbsp;We try to look out for them, but we don&#039;t got much.&nbsp; least I can do is teach them the ropes because many go insane or get hurt.&nbsp; Especially the pretty chicas,&nbsp; They all been tricked and kicked.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I know everyone on these streets, I know when my street children, brothers and sisters disappear...&nbsp; I heard the rumors, and noticed people missing.<br />&nbsp;On 6-27-13 at 2:00 Cali time, I SEEN it.<br /><br />I seen a lot more in my travels,&nbsp; Too much to write.&nbsp; Lets just say I&#039;m convinced we have&nbsp; 5-10 years before martial law if we&#039;re lucky.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll post more if I get the same love here as on the street.<br /><br />But anyways, This reminds me of a&nbsp; story my grandma told me.<br />One day she looked out the window and seen people cuffed and taken by the Nazis, a few weeks later they KILLED my grandmas family as she stayed hidden in a closet.<br /><br />YOU ALWAYS START MARTIAL LAW WITH CONTROLLING THE LOWEST LIKED PEOPLE!<br />THE US GOV KNOWs A SHIT STORMs COMING AND THEY ARE PREPPING!<br /><br />HELP ME, I HAVE A PLAN!<br />I need to set up farm/bases to sustain food and rest for future people of the struggle across the USA. because we believe war is coming.<br />Yes I said &quot;we&quot;<br />I&#039;m Reppin a few Street-Veterans here.<br />We got plans<br />WE NEED CAPITAL,<br />are not asking -directly- for money, I&#039;m a bum, not a beggar- there is a difference. <br />However I used to be a hella Dealer and I know EVERYONE in LA.<br /><br />PLEASE FRONT ME MDMA!&nbsp; I WILL PAY IT BACK!<br />and I&#039;ll become a great return customer, because I&#039;m gonna sell the shit out of it!<br />I mean FUCKING KIs across the whole country!<br />plus you&#039;ll be assured proceeds are going to the future prep.<br />I Chose to say fuck money a while ago, but if I fight without it, It will just be me throwing a empty jack bottle at a cop.<br />Either way I&#039;ll fight to the death.<br /><br />These songs of freedom, are all I ever had....-Bob Marley<br />And that&#039;s all I have, except for this new 10 year old laptop!<br /><br />I understand if you don&#039;t trust me, but please at least research events like these across the country and spread the word.<br />&nbsp;<br />Once, I almost dehydrated to death screaming for water as yuppies laughed in the dessert. So Hot I even had 1st degree burns from the sun.<br />BUT... When I make it, I will let them drink from my wells, and break bread.<br />I&#039;m doing this for everyone, one way or another.<br /><br />Thank you for reading,<br /><br /><br />Ve$cor,<br /><br /><br />The mentally challenged bum on many California curbs playing a mean guitar.<br />&quot;maybe he&#039;s not slow, maybe that&#039;s all an act?&quot;<br />Maybe I was just watching.&nbsp; Front Seat, Watching It all.<br />Shows over, time to get up, stand up... Stand up for your rights!

				Well you do seem to have put hearth into writing this. But then again you could just be some random dude looking for free drugs. I doubt that someone will front you with mdma but if someones actually does, I hope you aint just full of it. Goodluck anyhow man and if your situation is what it is I hope you somehow get out of it.

				If someone wanted to front you x, couldn&#039;t they just go to LA and look for the homeless guy with a laptop? I don&#039;t think anyone will, though, since your plan sounds kind of Charles Manson-ish, so why don&#039;t you just sell your laptop, dude

That&#039;s why I love it.&nbsp; <br />Believe it or not there&#039;s a few bums with laptops and facebooks in LA, look up VENICE CA BUMS for a laugh. I don&#039;t think they are using tor though.&nbsp; <br />Selling my laptop is not enough, plus my laptop sucks, i&#039;d be lucky to get $50.<br />I&#039;m trying to come up with money in the matrix, preferably illegally just for the fucks sakes and get a quick $1000ish for 50g of mdma.&nbsp; You&#039;ll all see, I&#039;m gonna make this happen. I just don&#039;t know how, but I been trying!<br /><br />And these farms are there also to support the soldiers.<br />The Taliban is successful because they hid amongst their people.<br />I&#039;m just saying, <br />ALL LANDOWNERS SHOULD TAKE THIS IN CONSIDERATION!<br />YOU CAN FEED AN ARMY, AND THAT&#039;S NOBLE AS FUCK!<br />Food is highly underrated...<br />and there is a bubble, growing. No one knows when it will pop.<br />&nbsp;And if it pops the price of food hyper-inflates and the few major food company&#039;s close because of the rapid hyper-inflation, Just like WW2 Italy.<br />&nbsp;A lot of people, especially in major metro areas are going to do anything to eat. <br />That&#039;s why I think they are going to implement martial law<br />To control the herd!<br />Much Love <br /><br />
