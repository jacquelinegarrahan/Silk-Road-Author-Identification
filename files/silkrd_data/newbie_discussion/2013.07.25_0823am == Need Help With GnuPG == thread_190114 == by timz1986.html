				I have been trying to figure this whole pgp thing out. I downloaded a program from gpgwin and all i see on my computer is something called Kleopatra and i really dont understand what to do with that. I see other peoples encrypted msgs and they use &quot;gnupg version ___&quot; all i want to do is get that and be on my way lol i did find an online encrypt/decrypt website but when i tried encrypted msgs from silkroad it said it didnt know what it was. i have a private and public key and a passphrase with that site and i can encrypt and decrypt my own msgs but that doesnt really help. if i cant decrypt their &quot;gnupg&quot; msg can they decrypt my &quot;BCPG&quot; msg?

				When you install, make sure you check the box for &quot;GPA.&quot; For some reason it isn&#039;t selected by default, which is really fucking dumb, considering that&#039;s the component most people are downloading the fucking package for.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve installed that, just open GPA and it&#039;s pretty straightforward.

				forget about kleopatra...it is hard to use and full of bugs...I treid it at first and then a senior member made the following reccommendation<br /><br />get gpg4usb and download it to a usb drive and use it from there...also recommend you choose an encryption password that you can easily memoriez and don&#039;t write it down anywhere...just in case things get ugly with LEO...they can&#039;t force you to cough up your password...<br /><br />keep tor and everything related to SR on that USB...a lot easier to hide than a computer..
