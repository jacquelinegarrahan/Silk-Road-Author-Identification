				Figured I would post this here since it can help others, but basically i am trying to learn how to place orders. I watched a good friend do it and wish I had paid attention more, but sadly he won&#039;t help me anymore so I am trying to learn on my own<br /><br />.As long as I follow the instructions and correctly fillout the form from bitfloor at BOA I&#039;m not going to lose my money right? Should I use a fake email with bitfloor or does it not matter?<br /><br />How do I move my bitfloor coins to my silk road wallet? I figure I gotta go to trade and do market order and wait till somebody gives me an offer for coins.<br /><br />My final question is about PGP, I don&#039;t understand how I put my address in that huge block of text, does anyone have a really good tutorial for how to put your address in the PGP code.<br /><br />Thnaks for the help!

				There won&#039;t be a form to fill out from Bitfloor. They will just give you the instructions you need for your deposit. All you really need is the account number and the deposit amount that they give you. Make certain you deposit the EXACT amount, since this is how they identify you. The form you will fill out is a BoA out-of-state deposit slip (assuming you don&#039;t live in NY). The email is just used to notify you when your deposits or withdraws are confirmed; you can use a Tormail address for this.<br /><br />Once you have money in your Bitfloor account and trade for BTC, you will use the &quot;Withdraw&quot; option to send them to your SR address (under the account tab on the main page). You can send them through an extra wallet or two for added anonymity, but SR already tumbles your BTC as it is.<br /><br />PGP is not hard to learn; check out this tutorial and you should have it down in no time. ---&gt; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of good guides out there but here&#039;s a couple of good starting points:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140099.0<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0
