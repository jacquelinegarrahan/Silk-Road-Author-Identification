				After browsing the road the past week or so I have seen a significant reduction in weed listings, and after further inspection I have noticed that my top 3 weed vendors have gone into stealth mode (which is something I&#039;ve never seen them do) along with various other vendors I have become a fan of. What&#039;s going on? Is law enforcement prone to inspecting packages more thoroughly this time of year, or is there a serious weed drought right now? Any input?

				When bitcoin is this expensive it makes sense for vendors to hold back products or sell them in real life until it comes down in price. <br />Think about it, say you sell something worth 5 btc and btc is at $115. The next day btc could be down to $90 and you&#039;ve lost all that money for nothing but the passing of time. <br />That&#039;s a real kick in the teeth to any vendor especially if he has yet to pay for the drugs he sold. <br />This is something that makes vending a potential nightmare and i&#039;m surprised more vendors don&#039;t go down to minimal listings when it happens.

				As a long time grower and distribution specialist, i can say that this is usually the time of year that you can bank on shit drying up for a while. <br /><br />Until mid to late october, when the GH and OD crops in cali are done being harvested, cured and ready for distribution. I have also come to learn in the countless years, that when these droughts come this time of year, its more so because all the big boys do this purposely as a sale tactic. They will hold down w.e they have, making the streets as dry as they can. This way once the GH and OD crops are ready to find homes, it is a lock that they will all fly off the shelves due to the streets being so hungry. <br /><br />Im not sure if its a joint effort, like all the biggest growers gather at the round table once a year and coordinate when to dry the market up, lol, but ive seen this go on for far to many years to totally rule out the conspiracy theory. heh.<br /><br />Rest assure that in the come weeks there will be a major influx of available marijuana. Remember where you heard it when you realize what goes on ;)

				drugs or money cant help you survive when the economy collapses, the money will be worth nothing and not your drugs either..<br /><br />Only what you have done to others and yourself is whats important.<br /><br />If you care about yourself then you care for others but you has to be the most important to yoruself since we are going thru hell to get to heaven.
