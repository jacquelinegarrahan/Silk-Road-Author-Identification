				I mean it&#039;s a bunch of info right?<br /><br />So what I mean can someone break it down. How PGP needs to be used-what to download ( I use a P.C.), purchasing coins ( I want to remain anonymous and would prefer not using bank account info),contacting seller and making purchase? I know there is more to it but the more I read on here the more I need to read!! Haha<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				I think everyone does things a little different.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />PGP needs to be used to encrypt sensitive information (name, address) when placing orders.&nbsp; I wont explain how to use PGP here because its been covered numerously on the forums. <br />To obtain bitcoins, I would use bitinstant. You can send a moneygram in exchange for bitcoins.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure you can use fake info on bitinstant.&nbsp; They have some form of ID check but I think its there to make sure you aren&#039;t a terrorist or some shit.&nbsp; Pay a moneygram at walmart if you have one in your area.&nbsp; They do not ID.&nbsp; From there, the bitcoins will deposit where ever it is you selected them to from the bitinstant website.&nbsp; You can have them sent to an email (use tormail for this,) or directly to an address.&nbsp; You can create a bitcoin address at a site called bitcoin fog.&nbsp; You deposit coins there and, for a small fee, they randomize your coins with their entire bitcoin flow (making your BTC untraceable).&nbsp; From there you can deposit them into your SR btc address where you can spend them as you wish.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can run TOR from a flash drive.&nbsp; Same with a PGP program.&nbsp; (search pgp4usb)&nbsp; There is potential security benefits in doing this.

				Wow thanks for the info<br />So from Bitinstant website they have a few options to deliver coins. 1 is to deliver to bitcoin wallet the other is bitcoin email. If I use bitcoin email would that be to the email address I set up via tormail&nbsp; and if so what then? I see on sr website under account that I have a deposit address. Will bitinstant send instructions in the email to input my deposit address from SR and from there it will be sent to my SR account? <br /><br />Now if I want to go the route 2 of sending directly to a bitcoin wallet address from bitinstant is that were I need to set up an address from bitfog? If so how does the deposit number I get from SR come into play? Is this the same bitcoin wallet address or this something different and I still need to set up an address through bitfog?<br /><br />Hope this wasn&#039;t confusing but your help would be appreciated<br />Thanks<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172158.msg1235026#msg1235026">Quote from: proxanne on June 14, 2013, 02:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think everyone does things a little different.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />PGP needs to be used to encrypt sensitive information (name, address) when placing orders.&nbsp; I wont explain how to use PGP here because its been covered numerously on the forums. <br />To obtain bitcoins, I would use bitinstant.
