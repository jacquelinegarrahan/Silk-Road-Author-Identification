				Really depends if you&#039;ve been doing other opiates or not (even have used them in the past) and quality of the heroin.&nbsp; I probably would be shy about doing too much if I were you about this drug.&nbsp; Its not like stimulants where there&#039;s a large gap between hospitalization and getting high.&nbsp; <br /><br />I should point out that I&#039;ve never done heroin, but would plan 5 mg as a first dose (I weigh 135), then depending on how I feel, add more.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know quite a lot of addicts though.

				Quarter of that should smash you.....10mgs for an &#039;opiate naive&#039; person (who&#039;s never had them before) should be PLENTY&nbsp; if it&#039;s good !!....<br /><br />BE CAREFUL and&nbsp; start slow maybe 10mgs at a time ...cut the amount in half and then half again....and have half that (12.5mgs) .. .<br /><br />IF you dont notice nothing within 15mins, then have the &#039;other half&nbsp; (i.e.12.5mgs<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Best of all is to have an &#039;unstoned/capable&#039;&nbsp; friend around (as a babysitter)&nbsp; &nbsp; JUST IN CASE!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />dont take any more for at least an hour, and see how you feel<br /><br /><br />I once shot about 150mgs of ketamine thinking it was coke!!!!&nbsp; IF NOT for my friend beside me ....I have NO IDEA what would have happened in the next half hour ....plus I was at the &quot;medical shooting gallery&quot; in sydney where there are drs and nurses standing around&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Man!&nbsp; I actually was thinking while it&nbsp; HIT me in the first few seconds was ... &quot;oh oh .... I think I&#039;m going to die in a sec&quot; .... funnily enough I didn&#039;t mind!&nbsp; The visuals were amazing, I couldn&#039;t see for the first 15minutes for the hallucinations ...but I could hear my friend telling me I was ok .....TF for all&nbsp; those factors!<br /><br />I&#039;d never had K before .... I learned what &quot;the K hole&quot; is in about 10 seconds!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Be careful bro ... take it slowly ...of all drugs heroin can vary in potency a LOT!&nbsp; &nbsp; :o&nbsp; And the dose/amount can just nicely stone one person, can kill another ... quickly! :o<br /><br />IF you happen to take too much, your mate will HAVE TO give you mouth to mouth for a few minutes til you come around&nbsp; &nbsp;(NO heart massage...people just stop breathing BUT their heart hasn&#039;t stopped!&nbsp; and THEN call an ambulance IF you stop breathing again (while your mate MUST &quot;rinse and repeat&#039; the M2M ;D)&nbsp; <br /><br />Do some research on sites like Bluelight and DrugsForum for starters&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend doing a big line first, people don&#039;t realize the possible outcome, split it into 10 lines maybe then snort one line, wait half an hour-45 minutes and if you feel you need another line have one. <br /><br />Have you messed with other opiates before like Oxycontin? if you have I recommend to try that first.&nbsp;

				haha I wasnt at all concerned until the posts from you guys! Now im second guessing it all together. I have snorted oxycontin and morphine even shot it. Oxycontint was a while ago but I think I did 20mg pill in about a day snorting. Morphine was 100 mg in a day. Didnt really make me &quot;high&quot; but knew i was different as well as threw up from the morphione in the morning ha. Concerned about herion now maybe I should sell it!! :P

				I&#039;ve done crap loads of morphine. Unfortunately it was all in a medical setting. But I still got high as shit from it. I once got a large morphine injection straight into a central line. They didn&#039;t inject it slowly either. Talk about a rush!<br /><br />Take my advice man. Walk away. Fast! You don&#039;t wanna fuck with this shit&nbsp;

				Usually, I&#039;d go in with somebody else, so we&#039;d both do it (keep everything clean, preferentily new, no &#039;used&#039; cottons, etc.) together, but one would help the other tie off, or just watch. You&#039;ll know in a second of two how good it is, if the other guy says &quot;oh my god&#039; and drops out, better hide your stuff and get help fast. I could never live with myself if I didn&#039;t do everything I could to save somebody who has overdosed. And it&#039;s not hard either, they&#039;ll just give one of two things (might be same thing but different names) something called Narkan or something else. It works in just a few seconds, if you&#039;re strung out, you&#039;ll wake up in full withdrawl. Then you have to wait until the Narcan (or whatever name) wears off. The half life of the Narcan is much shorter than the heroin. <br />Anyway, there is no reason for somebody to die with a human partner (I don&#039;t classify the other person as human if he/they don&#039;t do everything possible to save you)<br />I&#039;ve just slipped to the floor and been in exctacy and the other guy asked me if I was ok, and I said &#039;YEAH&#039;. You can even go out and wake up later and have your pocket emptied (the humunoids figured you wouldn&#039;t need money where you were going anyway)<br />But I guess you&#039;d just have to know (with scales or something) how much you&#039;re shooting to get in the ball park. <br />And I agree with the above posters that &#039;one is too many, and a thousand never enough&#039;-IOW if you&#039;re going to get high for a couple or few days and not have a &#039;breather&#039; in between, you&#039;ll get a habit. It&#039;s a real panically feeling, &#039;oh my god what do I do now? I don&#039;t have any money!&#039; And you need to get on methadone or subutex unless you&#039;re tougher than I am and can kick it by yourself. I&#039;ve always ONLY been able to kick it in jail, it&#039;s actually easier there because you know you are not going to be given anything (although I&#039;ve heard in some places if you are &#039;ALREADY on methadone, you might be allowed to keep on taking it. It can vary from county to county in the US. It&#039;s better (at least to me) to have some decent pain killers and &#039;sleepers&#039; (Vicodone and valium/xanax) and it&#039;s not too bad, and just getting off Vicodone isn&#039;t bad (just some sleepers needed)<br />It takes a while to get a habit the first time, and almost nothing to get a habit after you&#039;ve been good and strung out, your body changes in some way. I&#039;d just like to stick to Vicodone and Oxycodone, they&#039;re not too hard to kick.

				If you&#039;ve never done it before don&#039;t start now.<br />Unlike many drugs that are unnecessarily villainized, heroin is no joke, I&#039;ve seen the damage first hand.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know many (any?) people who have done it and not become addicted.

				Smart move asking, shows your careful. As long as your not slamming it, you should be ok with a decent line and enjoy. We don&#039;t know your weight, your opie tolerance, etc. Check out erowid.org, they have more detailed story&#039;s that maybe you can relate to and get an idea of dose. If that does not put you where you want to be, drop another line.

				If you&#039;re asking questions, then you&#039;re at least sensible. Start small, really small. Don&#039;t slam it. <br /><br />Even if you have a past tolerance with other opiates, still START SMALL. I had a friend who took a few years off of opiates and slammed heroin and OD&#039;d and died, from not a huge dose even. Many people here I&#039;m sure have a story like that, but it&#039;s not a drug to take lightly. <br /><br />IMO, if you are wanting opiates I would stick with pharms. They are at least regulated (but way more expensive). <br /><br />You can either use it and presumably have a good time, or sell it and make a few extra bucks; totally up to you. But I wouldn&#039;t take anyone&#039;s words of caution here for granted.

I know I am strang cuse I have quit crack, coke, cigarettes and nearly every addiction there is, guess thats why I am being pretective of mysefl so I dont do anything too stupid and die.

I snorted 10mg and within 5 or so minutes I was feeling slightly warm and fuzzy. It was quite a nice feeling. <br /><br />Although I have an &#039;addictive personality&#039; (whatever the fuck that means) I have managed not to get addicted to anything, even an ice smoking habit that went on for a few months. I just got bored, the ice did nothing anymore and I just said to myself &quot;this is sooooo pointess and a waste of money&quot;.<br /><br />Not only that, friends, family and career are far too important to me to let ANY drug control my life, EVER.<br /><br />After this H is gone, I&#039;m still undecided if I&#039;ll buy more. I mean it&#039;s a nice feeling and all, but so is blowing your load all over your girlfriend.<br /><br />I think addiction depends on so many factors that putting all those who try H (or use occasionally) in the &quot;you&#039;re going to get addicted&quot; group is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ll shut up now.

				So dude, how did it turn out? <br />It took me 10 years doing the &#039;weekend warrior&#039; thing, spending what I made during the week during the weekends. I was working in Cal bay area, and I had my connections in Fresno. Best shit I&#039;ve ever done, heroin, coke, meth, whatever was in Fresno. So after a period of time I noticed that it took a couple of days for me to get in &#039;my groove&#039; while working during the week. I&#039;d be feeling a little &#039;down&#039; the first couple of days. It got much worse later. I&#039;d be coming in late Monday or sometimes I&#039;d skip Monday and come in Tuesday. Sounds stupid, but it took me a long time to figure what was happening. It&#039;s not hard when you are &#039;chipping&#039; to stop it, especially when &#039;geographically&#039; you can&#039;t score for a few days. And of course the first time I gave up a job in the bay area and got a connection (even though not nearly as decent dope) I was &#039;surprised&#039; when I woke up strung out, of course it had happened many times before, to a lesser extent. You can give up a lot of material property when you are under the influence of opiates. You rationalize it, &#039;I&#039;lll make it back later&#039;. You pawn stuff. Your start being more careful about money (except for the drug part of the equation)<br />Thing is, I think I really wasted a good amount of time of my life just struggling to get high on the weekends, and when I moved to a local connection (and no job) I got some serious convictions that follow me still. But I still love opiates. I stay with Vicodone and maybe oxy&#039;s, I can deal with &#039;kicking&#039; those. Heroin, although by far the best rush, the best &#039;buzz&#039; the best everything, also addicts you&nbsp; the best. I think anybody who realizes that they are addicted the first&nbsp; time goes through some serious (soul searching, or something) and there is kind of a masachistic type of relation there (at least for me) I kind of figured that it &#039;served me right&#039; to be doing this stuff (although I had much earlier in my life come to the conclusion that the enjoyment of life was it&#039;s main purpose) After I got addicted for real, I didn&#039;t enjoy my life nearly as much anymore. Not only did I have a &#039;habit&#039; that I had to take care off, I did all kinds of things that compromised my character (or what I thought of as my character) You&#039;ll say to yourself, yes, I may do that-but I&#039;lll never do THAT. And then you do that. And it goes on. I guess if you were a novelist (William Burroughs) you gain a lot of insight, but it&#039;s not &#039;useful&#039; insight, you see the worst in a lot of people (and yourself) The jail/prison experience is a subject all to itself (but of course is tied to substances that society judges so badly that they will put you in a CAGE for using it)<br />For a period of 48 months, I was OUTSIDE 13 months. I got two prison terms, and a year spent in county jail and anybody that looks at my record sees robberies (although I never robbed anyone), petty thefts (guilty as charged) burglury (well maybe second degree, with malice aforethought) and I tried to stick to things that only involved &#039;companies&#039;. I thought that I was &#039;better&#039; (and still do) for making my money and not ripping off my friends. But society doesn&#039;t care about that. They label you a fuck up, and from then on, you are stuck in jobs that don&#039;t require a background check. And I&#039;ve noticed that the &#039;background&#039; check has EXPANDED rather than happen less often. <br />But I&#039;d still love to shoot up dope, I just don&#039;t want to go through the WHOLE experience anymore, the fun, the compromising of jobs and relationships that necessary making of money to stay &#039;well&#039; and super decreased tolerance to any kind of crime (in Cal they have the 15 years to life sentence if you have two prior &#039;violent&#039; felonies-which easily &#039;qualifies me&#039;)<br />But I&#039;d love to be able to shoot up some dope!<br />Real early, one of my memories is that now I knew what I wanted to live life for-that rush. I liked cocaine and heroin, speedballs. I don&#039;t see how anybody couldn&#039;t.

				I am currently helping a friend of mine come off of a nasty H cycle. If you do become dependent on it you will have difficulty functioning here on SR. You will be tempted to scam. The only cure I know of that works is Ibogain and Iboga. Good fortune that both products are offered here as well. If you do decide to use H I would HIGHLY HIGHLY encourage you to acquire 10g of Iboga root bark. You can end the cycle without agony with one treatment and have fun while your doing it. I know Yeshua sells 10g Ibogain bark for $150 US. Good luck friend!

				You can always do more so I would divide it into at least 10 bumps. It depends on quality and your tolerance but when I started I only needed 5-15mg to feel a decent nod and euphoria and 30mg knocked me out.<br /><br />Also you should be careful to take your time, depending on what type of heroin you bought It can take a few minutes to hit you and a few more to kick in full.<br /><br />In my experience #3takes longer to absorb and hit you then #4 with is in the easier to absorb salt form.

				To summarize, start small and give it time to hit you. #3 witch is normally tan to light brown to brown can take like 15 mins for some ppl. #4 normally white or off white still takes time but I find it normally like 5 maybe 10 minutes.<br />if your not sure that your getting high look in the mirror, your pupils will start to turn to pins and you&#039;ll notice a cool or warm pleasure wash over you.<br />it&#039;s awesome and everyone knows that but it&#039;s also evil man, I know on one likes people to preach but Iv been in more shit for lady h then anything else<br />Just be smart man and let once be enough

				Update: product arrived and started slow 12.5mg. Didn&#039;t do much so took more. Eventually did about 40mg of what was meant it be 60% or more and come in a rock.

				As you&#039;d assume you&#039;ll probably enjoy the experience, and likely repeat. I&#039;d suggest with Heroin, and Opiates in general limit the amount you order over a set period of time so you can&#039;t simply use willpower only as a moderator, it&#039;s one drug where despite being someone who considers himself a take it or leave it kind of person despite availability, I know in the case of H if I had an available stock every day, I could NOT resist... it would not end well for me. Any drug can get out of hand of course and it&#039;s a personal thing, we aren&#039;t the same people post usage in terms of brain chemistry so predicting your own behavior and potential for addiction can be a guessing game, but most people can manage with most recreational drugs I think, Heroin is different with a pull quite unlike any other - it&#039;s just too fucking good.

I was working in Cal bay area, and I had my connections in Fresno. Best shit I&#039;ve ever done, heroin, coke, meth, whatever was in Fresno. So after a period of time I noticed that it took a couple of days for me to get in &#039;my groove&#039; while working during the week. I&#039;d be feeling a little &#039;down&#039; the first couple of days. It got much worse later. I&#039;d be coming in late Monday or sometimes I&#039;d skip Monday and come in Tuesday. Sounds stupid, but it took me a long time to figure what was happening. It&#039;s not hard when you are &#039;chipping&#039; to stop it, especially when &#039;geographically&#039; you can&#039;t score for a few days. And of course the first time I gave up a job in the bay area and got a connection (even though not nearly as decent dope) I was &#039;surprised&#039; when I woke up strung out, of course it had happened many times before, to a lesser extent. You can give up a lot of material property when you are under the influence of opiates. You rationalize it, &#039;I&#039;lll make it back later&#039;. You pawn stuff. Your start being more careful about money (except for the drug part of the equation)<br />Thing is, I think I really wasted a good amount of time of my life just struggling to get high on the weekends, and when I moved to a local connection (and no job) I got some serious convictions that follow me still. But I still love opiates. I stay with Vicodone and maybe oxy&#039;s, I can deal with &#039;kicking&#039; those. Heroin, although by far the best rush, the best &#039;buzz&#039; the best everything, also addicts you&nbsp; the best. I think anybody who realizes that they are addicted the first&nbsp; time goes through some serious (soul searching, or something) and there is kind of a masachistic type of relation there (at least for me) I kind of figured that it &#039;served me right&#039; to be doing this stuff (although I had much earlier in my life come to the conclusion that the enjoyment of life was it&#039;s main purpose) After I got addicted for real, I didn&#039;t enjoy my life nearly as much anymore. Not only did I have a &#039;habit&#039; that I had to take care off, I did all kinds of things that compromised my character (or what I thought of as my character) You&#039;ll say to yourself, yes, I may do that-but I&#039;lll never do THAT. And then you do that. And it goes on. I guess if you were a novelist (William Burroughs) you gain a lot of insight, but it&#039;s not &#039;useful&#039; insight, you see the worst in a lot of people (and yourself) The jail/prison experience is a subject all to itself (but of course is tied to substances that society judges so badly that they will put you in a CAGE for using it)<br />For a period of 48 months, I was OUTSIDE 13 months. I got two prison terms, and a year spent in county jail and anybody that looks at my record sees robberies (although I never robbed anyone), petty thefts (guilty as charged) burglury (well maybe second degree, with malice aforethought) and I tried to stick to things that only involved &#039;companies&#039;. I thought that I was &#039;better&#039; (and still do) for making my money and not ripping off my friends. But society doesn&#039;t care about that. They label you a fuck up, and from then on, you are stuck in jobs that don&#039;t require a background check. And I&#039;ve noticed that the &#039;background&#039; check has EXPANDED rather than happen less often. <br />But I&#039;d still love to shoot up dope, I just don&#039;t want to go through the WHOLE experience anymore, the fun, the compromising of jobs and relationships that necessary making of money to stay &#039;well&#039; and super decreased tolerance to any kind of crime (in Cal they have the 15 years to life sentence if you have two prior &#039;violent&#039; felonies-which easily &#039;qualifies me&#039;)<br />But I&#039;d love to be able to shoot up some dope!<br />Real early, one of my memories is that now I knew what I wanted to live life for-that rush. I liked cocaine and heroin, speedballs. I don&#039;t see how anybody couldn&#039;t.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What lokiju wrote is gospel, the pattern he describes is exactly how it happens. Ask any junkie and they will probably have some variation, no one starts out and says, man I can&#039;t wait to become a junkie, what a great life! I sure hope when I&#039;m going through yet another wd in a filthy cell the other inmates will pull my hair back while I puke. Or more insidious, during the years of being straight and doing the right thing you can ALMOST feel that feeling of perfection that H brings. And it eats at you. LOL, I still get a woody from smelling scotch tape. Listen, your an adult (well I hope) and maybe you can be cool with it, maybe your the one who can handle it. Start kinda with a low dose, try not to move up too fast and enjoy it now, its the best it will be.

				Like a lot of people stated, start of with a small dosage. You can ALWAYS do more, not the other way around. Be super clean during every step. Use sterilized water, clean syringe, fresh cotton, sanitary place to do it, clean habits preparing the shot, etc. The bullet point of this is to do everything CLEAN &amp; SAFE. None of this applies if you&#039;re snorting. Just don&#039;t snort off a toilet seat or public sink, for christ&#039;s sake.
