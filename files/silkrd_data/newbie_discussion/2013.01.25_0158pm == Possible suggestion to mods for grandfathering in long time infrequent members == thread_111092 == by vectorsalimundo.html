				As I suggested in an existing thread but want to make a new topic for in order to promote visibility, I think that simply filtering posting abilities based on number of posts is already being abused and simply barely inconveniencing the spammers, considering as soon as last night I saw spam in the real forums.<br /><br />A lot of us are semi-lurkers who have been around months and even years but haven&#039;t posted much and are the ones getting screwed most by this. My suggestion is to add access control based on the age of someone&#039;s account coupled with a filter on their frequency of posting (which can be found on your profile). Mine is currently 0.136 per day with an account age of 330 days. I don&#039;t think a spammer account or many of the accounts which are currently locked out would have stats like this. Please consider this suggestion and even leave feedback in this thread or discuss it because the ridiculousness of this is way past funny.

				I agree it would be easier for long-time lurkers but it may be the software doesn&#039;t even support this.&nbsp; In the meantime we&#039;re the ones with the control to get above 50 posts if we want to give feedback and participate in the normal forums etc.&nbsp; See you on the other side... :)

				Word, I&#039;ve been an SR member for 11 months, but I don&#039;t post here because I have to have 50 posts. Decided that tonight was the night to spam my way up to 50, but seriously. This is tedious.
