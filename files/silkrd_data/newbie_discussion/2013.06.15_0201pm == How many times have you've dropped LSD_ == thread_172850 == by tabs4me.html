				I&#039;ve done it over 100 times within the past years.&nbsp; The experience is just so overwhelming and it&#039;s the understanding of the LSD that makes me want to keep doing it.&nbsp; Just like DMT.

				First time about an hour and a half ago.<br /><br />I have over 100 experiences with other compounds(mostly mescaline and it&#039;s many analogs), and have been waiting to experience LSD for a while now.<br /><br />So far it&#039;s beautiful, and I think it will flow really well with my mind today :).&nbsp; Hoping to get lost in the woods for a few hours.

				I can&#039;t count the number of times, back in the 90&#039;s every concert or rave I went to, hundred&#039;s. And many other times in between those events. Any time I wanted to find another world. If it&#039;s something you enjoy doing, you will enjoy it more tripping. I don&#039;t recommend driving, but even though you think your brain is stupid when you trip, your not really you just think you are. Your setting is important, if your new you want to be in a setting you can control...not at Walmart? But a trip to Walmart can be an adventure too. Tripping will make you easily amused!
