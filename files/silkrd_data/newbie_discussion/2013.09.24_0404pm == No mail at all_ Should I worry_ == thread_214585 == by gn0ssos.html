				I&#039;m sure I&#039;m just being paranoid again, but I just wanted to ask about this and see if anyone finds this weird/has any experience with this. I&#039;m expecting my orders (very small, just blotter and a tiny bit of molly) to be here any day now. I usually get some sort of mail every day, even if it&#039;s just junk, but today I found it odd that the postman totally skipped my house all together. Should I be suspicious or am I just being paranoid?<br /><br />Thanks for any advice/encouragement. This is my first order so I&#039;m a little nervous.

				I think you&#039;re just paranoid.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why, even if they were preparing a CD on you, why they wouldn&#039;t deliver junk.&nbsp; If anything they&#039;d want things to look normal.<br /><br />Don&#039;t think about it so much, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine.

				It happens man.. and before you new about SR, if it had happened then that your mailbox was empty all together, it wouldnt have been a problem to dwell on. In fact before SR, when i got NO mail, it was a good day for me.. bills,bills,bills.<br /><br />Point im making is, it happens, not to stress it..and certainly dont begin showing any strange behavior because of it. Such as constantly checking your mail box and what have you.

I figured I was just being paranoid, guess I just needed the affirmation. I ordered Friday night anyway so I&#039;m probably getting my hopes up thinking it&#039;d be here this early... you know how it is though, I&#039;m just ready for it to be here already!<br /><br />Isallmememe, I&#039;m in the US. I&#039;m not sure why I said &quot;postman,&quot; guess I should&#039;ve said &quot;mailman&quot;. No, I watched him drive right by my house so definitely not on strike. I hear that happens often in the UK though, unfortunately for us SR users.

				Exact same shit happened to me.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re just much more aware of when you get mail because you&#039;re paying attention.&nbsp; Do you really have to throw junk out daily?&nbsp; Or just a lot once every few days?
