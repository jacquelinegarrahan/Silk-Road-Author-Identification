				Weekly, monthly, etc?<br /><br />As a new user id be interesting to hear what the deal is and if you&#039;ve had any negative long-term issues that could have been caused by it - depression, mood swings, etc., or is it all good?<br /><br />All the talk and studies you see online about damaging serotonin levels, cells, etc. is pretty scary.

				If you want to be absolutely safe, wait 6 weeks minimum.&nbsp; That is how long it takes for your brain to regain serotonin balance.

				The safest suggested wait period between rolls, is 2 months.. though many, my self included, find this a bit hard. <br /><br />Id say doing mdma any more than once every 3-4 weeks is seriously harming your body.

				5 htp can help you get back to a regular sleep pattern after a roll.&nbsp; It also really helps with the &quot;Tuesday depression&quot; period.

				I like to wait a good month or two, but it&#039;s always tough. The way it was explained to me was like this: Your serotonin level is like a gas tank. The first time you drop, you drop on a full tank. If you drop immediately after that, you&#039;re dropping on a half tank; etc. etc. The longer you wait in between the more time your body has to fill up your tank! <br /><br />Obviously the lower the tank the worse you&#039;re off (longer comedown, side effects, etc.)

				I take my supplements properly, and I only take known-good (eg. lab- or multi-reagent-tested by me) MDMA. 1-6 months. I don&#039;t feel there&#039;s a &quot;need&quot; to do it, I just keep it in my mind as something that I might add to make a wonderful Saturday night. Or if my partner isn&#039;t feeling up to it, we pass on it for another week or three. No urgency.<br /><br />So: 1-6 months. I&#039;d probably do it once with only two weeks spacing, but that&#039;s unlikely. It&#039;d have to be some kind of once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.<br /><br />Keep it special.

				I was to have a break of at least two weeks as apparently this is how long it takes the serotonin to recover if you are dosing &lt; 200mg. <br /><br />Thanks for the tip on 5htp, did not know about that. <br />

				Just weighing in.<br /><br />You should ALWAYS wait at least 6 weeks between rolling on drugs that heavily impact on the serotonin system.<br /><br />There are more than one reason for this<br /><br />First (as already stated) your brain needs time to bring your serotonin levels back to normal before you start suppressing it again.<br /><br />Secondly, your psyche has to take in all the experiences you had on your MDMA trip, and if you dont give this the time it needs, it will eventually overwhelm you, and start giving you some negative reactions.<br /><br />Someone mentioned 5HTP as away to load up your serotonin faster, and that is, in part, correct.<br />The thing is; we know that 5 HTP is an amino-acid that works as a precursor for serotonin in the body. However there have really not been much studies conducted on how this actually works, but recently the discussion have turned to a consensus that less than 1% of the serotonin created by 5HTP will actually reach the brain, thus meaning that 99%+ will just be floating around the bloodstream where it is not useful at all!<br />Actually a lot of more recent users point to the fact that if you role to often, and supplement with 5HTP, you are a lot more likely to get some of those nasty side-effects like Serotonin-syndrome or you will just &quot;loose the magic&quot;.<br />A better advice for loading up on serotonin is to eat turkey, and other things with Tryptophane (Which is the natural source of 5HTP) because with tryptophane-rich foods the serotonin will be a lot more likely to help your brain chemistry than the artificial stuff.<br /><br />On a side note i can tell you that a large number of the MDMA studies that were conducted before the year 2000, have been redacted simply because they were too unscientific, and the results could not be reproduced (One of the most famous studies that showed how MDMA &quot;fried&quot; the nerve endings in the brain was later discovered to having giving the test rats MDMA amounts in excess of 1G MDMA/KG body-weight, and close to no food for a 10 day period!)<br /><br />In fact some of the newest studies (on human) shows that after a period of more than 212 days without MDMA, there is no effects visible on the brain, no matter how excessive you have used this substance! This is not to say that there are no changes, but they damages to your psyche rather than to your actual brain!<br /><br />Sincerely Candy

I&#039;m a few days off a large weekend binge of crystals, and while I haven&#039;t had so much as a headache, I do feel a little low/&#039;empty&#039;, so I&#039;m going to give 5-HTP a shot for a week or so and see how I go - it is apparently helpful for weight loss, mood swings and depression also as serotonin also resides in the gut as well as the brain naturally (having done some extensive searching last night!)

				I&#039;d say about a week but really it depends on how much you do and how often, like 100mg will have less of a cumulative effect than if you did 300mg every weekend for 4 weeks.

				2 weeks in between rolls are a minimum for me (I did it a few times a week for a few months, many years ago but in the end that really didn&#039;t bring me much good...). Preferably wait more (a month or so)...especially if you&#039;re &quot;new&quot; to the product you should try to start off with the good habits (sleep, eat, hygiene!)<br />I only take magnesium to &quot;compensate&quot; (magnesium citrite or something like that, I forgot the exact translation). <br /><br />Also, about dosage - I used to take &quot;heroic doses&quot; (up to &gt;1g in 7-8 hours) but that also didn&#039;t bring me much good. Now I stick to 120-125mg per night and enjoy it more than bigger doses (especially since I combine it with 2C-B or LSD more often than not). Also, when taking &quot;small&quot; doses such as 120mg your tolerance should be back to zero after 2 weeks, so you&#039;ll enjoy the experience just as much each time...if you take the same product (or better) in good company ;-)<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget about cross-tolerance with other products (such as LSD). <br /><br />Enjoy your rolls!

				Just offering personal experience - no intellectual research or anything.<br />I only roll 2-3 times per year but when I do, several times, it has been 2 nights in a row or separated by a night.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually special occasions like a trip to Ibiza (my first time using molly - it&#039;s a fun story I may write up - my buddy and I each bought a gram, we were fucking clueless and thought that was the typical dose - we each just downed a gram and went to the club - insanity followed) or EDC.<br />Again - I don&#039;t know shit, don&#039;t claim to be an expert, it&#039;s just what I have done.<br /><br />I can say it is really hard, as most of you know, to get any decent roll going the second night.<br /><br />This year at EDC (only going the first two nights) we&#039;ll do a candy flip (heavy on the acid and light on the molly) the first night and just roll the second.
