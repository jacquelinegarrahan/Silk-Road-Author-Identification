				Hello all fellow silkroad peeps. I wanna share my 25c story and i want you guys to share your 25x stories!<br />To start off I purchased 100 tabs of 1000ug 25c and i got a few friends with me... We made the room we were in more trip friendly.<br />We all got settled and each popped a tab after we did that i turned on some sublime and hugged my teddy bear &lt;--- its ok because i was tripping.<br />About an hour in we all decided that we wanted another So we popped it again. Chilled a little longer probably about 20 mins..Then BOOM like a trainwreck it hit me. There were pink triangles floating in the air the floor was checked with green &amp; blue neon boxes. I was feeling pretty good. <br />But we all realized none of us have to work the next day...So we pop another one (probably not our best idea) That one kicks in fairly fast.<br />When it kicked in we walked outside it was about 2:30am We started to walk around and it felt like i was walking on my knees...and i could feel fur but i wasnt touching anything. In otherwords i had a extremly fun time. The total trip time was about 11hrs. <br /><br />Please share your stories below<br />and i have tripped on 25x 17 times please post how many times you have done it
