				Hi I&#039;m new on here, so forgive me if this has been covered. I&#039;ve looked down the most recent threads and haven&#039;t really got a clearer answer, so hopefully you guys can help.<br />We have all gone through a fairly lengthy process to ensure we&#039;re anonymous here. <br />I am hidden through Tor.<br />I have even bought coins through a roundabout way just to make extra sure. <br />So the transaction I am about to carry out is as safe as it can be.<br />The vendor doesn&#039;t know me and I don&#039;t know him (I don&#039;t want to). <br />He gets my money through an anonymous process and he, in return, sells me what I want.<br />And then it all falls apart - I have to supply him with an address to deliver to.<br />So an address is in his hands. <br />Are you all comfortable with that or am I missing something?<br />We&#039;ve gone to all this trouble to hide ourselves and then we have to give an address away.<br />Surely there is a better way of ensuring anonymity at the final stage - any answers?<br />I don&#039;t want to compromise my friends by asking them to take delivery, I&#039;m not going to get it sent to my home address for obvious reasons, so what is the answer?<br />Or do you just bite the bullet and hope the Royal Mail (yes I am in the UK) delivers without question?<br />All seems a bit like it is a great system until the final step.<br />But like I say I&#039;m new and maybe I have missed something<br />Love to hear your advice<br />Thanks<br /><br />

				Sounds like you&#039;ve taken almost every precaution. Next, you&#039;ll want to use PGP to encrypt your address when sending it to the vendor. This ensures that the vendor is the only one to read your address. <br /><br />Past that, just make sure you are using a reputable vendor. If they have poor/no feedback, I&#039;d stay away. Everything should work out just fine. Good luck, and welcome to Silk Road!

				Yeah, this freaked me out too a bit. Best way to avoid it is to get a drop point. You know, another address that you send your items too. It can be expensive though, you have to pay whoever you&#039;re sending it too. Also, it needs to be someone that you can trust completely. Try looking into that.

				This is why researching vendors and reading their review threads in the Rumor Mill is critically important, because at the end of the day you are giving your name and address to a drug dealer. You need to convince yourself that the vendor you intend to buy from has a history of happy and content customers, and therefore is worthy of your trust.

				Thanks all, except Nassy (not quite sure where you&#039;re coming from).<br />The vendor feedback checks all make sense, but as you point out - these are drugs dealers we&#039;re buying off.<br />They have to pack and post stuff to us, which means they&#039;re likely they have made a note of the address to write out the package for posting.<br />I am not bothered about Royal Mail and intercepts but my experience of drug dealers is they ain&#039;t the most reliable and at some point the old bill are likely to come knocking on their door.<br />And, if that happens, all we can do is hope our friendly anonymous dealer has remembered to destroy all records of any of our addresses.<br />Like I said in the first post it all this work to keep anonymous seems to fall apart at the last step.<br />But hey ho, less risky than sitting in a dealer&#039;s front room I suppose.<br /><br /><br />

				How would you get your goods from a vendor without an address? You have to have some faith in them to be legit I suppose....
