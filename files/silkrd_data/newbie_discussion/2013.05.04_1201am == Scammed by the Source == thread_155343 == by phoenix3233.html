				Placed an order with the Source almost 2 weeks ago, The Source posted that it was in transit the next day via 2 day USPS.<br /><br />Never received the order despite having received orders I placed after the one I placed with The Source.<br /><br />2 days before auto finalization I went to the resolution center and proposed a refund of my bitcoins. No response as The Source had not been on the site in 12 days.<br /><br />I was using the Onion app and tried to move my cursor over the send funds/finalize button and it somehow loaded so now my bitcoins have been released to this vendor who NEVER sent me my order.<br /><br />Support has told me that &quot;finalization is final&quot;. Great, thanks SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had many smooth transactions here and now this. <br /><br />Hoping the Source will regain a conscience and not be an asshole and refund my bitcoins.<br />Anyone had experience with this?? Any help would be much appreciated!!

				Gotta be careful... but he didn&#039;t have you FE in the first place? don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a scam... hopefully it arrives?

				I would hope so, but The Source marked it as in transit (2 day USPS) almost 2 weeks ago, so I doubt it&#039;s coming.<br />Another newbie posted about the same issue with the Source...<br /><br />The Source didn&#039;t ask me to FE, there was no communication at all and he/she hasn&#039;t been on the site since the day the order was supposedly sent out (marked as &quot;in transit&quot;).<br /><br />Has anyone else had a problem with the Source? as Minny said he has no feedback on his page. I&#039;m just really frustrated.<br /><br />Thanks for replying!
