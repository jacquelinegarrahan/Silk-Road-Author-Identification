When you fill in the info for bitinstant, use a bogus name, bogus bday and an old phone number and old address, or use the adress of an apt building with out the apt number, tell them its a private house. There is a camera in the machine that records you i would imagine, just wear a hoody or low hat, sun shades and cover up any tattoos you may have visable.
