				I recently joined here looking for a good vendor for high quality #3 or #4. Here in Canada stomped on stuff goes for a minimum $250/g and with vendors like uglydoll selling .5g for .34BTC I would imagine I would be getting similar quality but for a lesser price.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard gotsitall and subs are the guys to go to, but if anyone can also recommend other vendors please do!<br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t tried gotsitall yet.&nbsp; I&#039;ll get right on that. My top 3:<br />1. Subs. Fire.<br />2. SupremeSmoke. Excellent.<br />3. UndergroundSyndicate. I&#039;ve seen mixed reviews and I think some people have had issues, so do your research, but I got very good gear from him.

				Could you please PM me the vendor page for supremesmoke?&nbsp; Underground is selling supertrips which based on reviews is either fentanyl or an analog of fentanyl such as butyramide-fentanyl or acetyl-fentanyl.

				Dr.Holland is also looking to be a promising new vendor with great prices as well. Considering the pricing for H in the eastern part of the world I find subs pricing to be a little bit hard to swallow but I&#039;ll end up buying from him indefinitely.

				I would not recommend UGS... it&#039;s def not h as advertised... prolly fent or something like that. Subs gear i would rate B-. I tend to stay away from the individual stamps but DD had decent street quality stuff but was expensive for the quantity.

				Definitely staying away from UGS and SuperTrips. Considering they appear first in the bestselling sorting method that can become seriously confusing and downright dangerous for a lot of new users who haven&#039;t been around the online vending scene very long....<br /><br />Also I&#039;d like to point out that the Fentanyl Synthetic Mix / Lactose is most certainly a Butyrmiade-Fentanyl 1:100 mix that is available through a lab and vendor that I also have connect to. This vendor should be honest about the material used as it can cause serious problems.<br /><br />Anyone have experience with Uglydoll or Buldogisthieboss?

				its getting more difficult to find good connects. it&#039;s easier to say who to stay away from.<br /><br />tmorrowman used to be ok but then every time would be different and seemingly worse than the last. i took a gamble with northern dancer once but was basically ripped off.<br /><br />its difficult to find consistency for some reason.

				It&#039;s really hard to find consistency.&nbsp; Lately I&#039;ve been chasing the dragon sometimes, because it seems like consistently good BTH is more readily available on the road.

				I&#039;ve tried heroin fro 6 or 7 vendors so far, and none has really been satisfying.&nbsp; I used to use back in the 1970&#039;s and no dope I&#039;ve found on here can compare with what I found routinely back then.&nbsp; The dope on SR is definitely strong, but lacks the pleasurable and euphoric feelings I got from dope back in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; As far as a good deal, I would recommend MisterMcFeely.&nbsp; His dope is well priced ($150/gram) and as good as any other dope sold for $200/gram and up.&nbsp; Plus I&#039;ve found him personable and nice doing business with.

				It&#039;s extremely obvious that the majority of H vendors on here are also users, which is the source of the majority of the issues...<br /><br />It seems like I&#039;ll be going with Subs even though the price is a ridiculous high. I would really like prices like UglyDoll and am going to try the lower price vendors such as UglyDoll, Bulldogistheboss or Italy89 to try and attain a balance between cost and quality.<br /><br />Really sad what&#039;s happening on the road regarding this product, there needs to be a major cleanup.

				Double post because I&#039;m also curious about the sellers Opi and Psilocin. Opi claims to have 78% pure heroin through process of conversion to base but its evident his chemistry is far from experienced.<br /><br />

				I bought and smoked 300mg of BestOn3&#039;s cheap #3 H. It&#039;s the only heroin I&#039;ve ever tried, and I have no opiate tolerance.<br /><br />I had it in 3 separate sessions, steadily improving tooter skill until the final go where I was nodding fairly.<br /><br />I do feel that my tooting abilities could still improve, and were I consistent I could have got three moderate-to-heavy doses. Make of that what you will, considering my virgin opioid receptors.

				Got some from Terabithia. Sells stamps, quality ( B+/- ). The service is outstanding. Shipped same day as ordered, per the order page. Arrived 3-4 days. <br />T. said today, &quot;&nbsp; I have fire right now this stuff is amazing!!!! Not even kidding..&quot; I&#039;ve no reason to doubt, they&#039;ve done everything they said they would. For the price...Great. <br /><br />Some of these guys think they&#039;re Golden, I say the proof is when you&#039;ve done it. I don&#039;t mind paying for the best if it IS the best, but I&#039;m not going to pay someone a premium for the privilege of sending them my money. I notice some vendors don&#039;t offer small quantity to let you try. That says to me, &quot;You should be glad I&#039;m willing to LET you buy from me.&quot; <br /><br />WTF <br /><br />Don&#039;t know about&nbsp; the rest of you, but I&#039;m not going to do business with anyone that doesn&#039;t allow you to try before making a substantial commitment. If a vendor isn&#039;t willing to sell you a small quantity to try, good luck to them. If their stuff is as good as they seem to think, great, but I have never and will never do business like that. After all, we&#039;re all out to do the best we can and keep from getting ripped off. Basically, rule is &quot;Try before you buy.&quot; If a vendor isn&#039;t in tune to that mentality, I wish them the best of luck.<br /><br />One vendor I PM&#039;d back and forth 3 days, no problem. Had &#039;White&quot;. Placed order, four days later, still processing, no response to repeated PM&#039;s. I understand they&#039;re busy. I didn&#039;t place a large order, ( see above ). Problem was no communication. He told me later (over a week) it was a problem with his SR laptop. Shit Happens. I cancelled the order and placed another w/Terabithia. Volumes of PMs, arrived just as promised. I will be doing a lot more with Teribithia, just for the peace of mind. <br /><br />Vendors, you got it, we want it. However, you&#039;re not the only one. As the volume gets larger, more vendors come online, the customer gets more choice, everyone wins. Except the ones that still think they can do whatever they want. Supply and demand. In every open market an equilibrium is reached. Some will prosper, some will not. Word to the wise....
