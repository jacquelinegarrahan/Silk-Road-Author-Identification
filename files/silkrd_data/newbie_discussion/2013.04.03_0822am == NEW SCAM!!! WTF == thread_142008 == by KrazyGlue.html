				I&#039;m guessing that when people saw that the scammer got away with &gt; $130,000, they decided to give it a try as well.&nbsp; So now it&#039;s either the scammer, some copycats, or a combination of both.

				Thanx. I&#039;m wondering if these fuckfaces registered these names before they stopped allowing spacebars in the names. And were waiting for a certain time to strike. i mean this is just crazy. why r people continuing to fall for them? theres been a million today alone. cant people just use their brains??

				I never fall for the SR ADMIN STAFF ect but I think I lost .06 BTC to a new scam.&nbsp; The scammer says they want to buy an order and asks for a few $$ worth of bitcoin to complete the order.&nbsp; Then when you send it they say they need a few more $$ to compete the order.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; it&#039;s like &quot;hey buddy can you spare .06 BTC???&quot;

				I&#039;m kind of at a loss as to how they could accomplish anything with this scam. Did they give you a link to change your PIN or something like that? It&#039;s like me telling your password is &quot;password123&quot; or something. I don&#039;t really get anything unless something else is going on.
