				So I was just wondering what drugs you guys consider to be safe, as in low/no physical harm and low/no dependence, hard/impossible to overdose, etc.<br /><br />So far I have only smoked weed, here&#039;s a list of things I want to try:<br />Shrooms<br />LSD<br />Mescaline<br />2C-B<br />DMT<br />MDMA<br /><br />Anyway I kinda made this thread in hopes of adding more stuff to my to-try-later list<br /><br />If you know some good safe drugs I haven&#039;t listed please share. :)<br /><br />Sorry for the stupid thread.

				out of those lists, if you are getting them from a trusted vendor in order of safety I would have to say. <br /><br />LSD<br />MDMA<br />Schrooms<br />2C-B<br />Mescaline<br />DMT ( if you are getting REALLY pure dmt it is reccomended to have a .001 scale, however it also depends on your body etc.)<br /><br />Hope that helps<br /><br />Also mixing MDMA and Mescaline is SOOOOOO FUN

				Anything can be bad for you, and it&#039;s possible to OD on just about everything -- the important thing, regardless of what you are taking in, is the AMOUNT you are using.&nbsp; Obviously, a dose of one substance can be way worse than the same amount of, say, meth, but it&#039;s just something to keep in mind.&nbsp; There are quite a few things out there that are safe when used in moderation.&nbsp; As far as I know, most opiates have little to no negative physical side effects when used in moderation.&nbsp; It&#039;s just the amount people do/addiction that takes its toll.

				Try ketamine, its out of this world (literally) and is pretty safe to use in the right setting, chronic use can lead to health problems, HANG ON - chronic use of anything can cause health problems!<br /><br />I would say try anything you have an interest in once, I have tried most things bar most of the new analogue type of drugs.<br />Also, i have never tried crack or crystal meth, but they don&#039;t really appeal to me. <br />I don;t like speed, and with coke I can take it or leave it (Cocaine and ketamine is a different mattter!!!)<br />I used to smoke an eighth a day of weed but went off that.<br />I love psychedelics but&nbsp; only use them very occasionally, they can teach you the most.<br />I say take it easy, don&#039;t repeatedly do the same drug days in a row especially with opiates, eat healthily etc.<br />And don&#039;t blow all your money and you will have some fun and enlightening times with many of the substances you can find on here, in fact I think doing some of these substances and the experiences you have will change the way you think for ever (in a positive way)<br />

				I don&#039;t personally believe any drug is safe when it forms a habit when you like the results. Could be sugar, could be cocaine.<br />For example, I can get prescriptions for Valium, Norco, prolly Oxy too, but for 1, I hate downers but love pot so I smoke it.<br />Not at all saying the meds don&#039;t serve a purpose, I have muscle spasms in my back and Valium is something that kills the pain and the spasms.<br />And 2, I know I would be tempted to sell them and get busted.<br />I know how much Oxys especially sell for around here, so I&#039;d get addicted selling Oxy&#039;s to feed my real habit, pot, so either way, I&#039;m fucked.<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t say weed is safe. Mind me I love weed, but I&#039;m sure burning any plant matter and inhaling its contents is bad for you. Nicotine is the drug and its actually good for you, helps mildly stimulates you if you take patches instead of smoking, but its the smoking thats harmful!

Most hallucinogens, at least the well studied ones are not addictive, very hard to od (not referring to all the research chem type im unfamiliar with) on unless you were trying to and itd be very hard, youd prolly just go nuts for a bit off a lsd overdose, even for me after eating way too much acid, ive always peaked past the worst after 12 hours minus afterglow and after that im good on tripping for a weeks-months, so it really has no addictive qualities. when i first tried acid/shrooms i really liked it and wanted to explore more, but you develop a fast tolerance and need to&nbsp; space it out in order to achieve the trip. The tolerance from hallucinogens does not create withdrawal symptoms when stopped, in fact in my case, Im ready to take on the world without drugs after a good trip!

				If by &quot;safe&quot; you mean no permanently damaging physical effects on the body, then probably LSD. The LD100 for monkeys is apparently 5mg/Kg which i think works out at about 3,000 standard doses (as sold on SR), though it probably depends on the type of monkey, and whether or not it&#039;s organic blotting paper.

				All drugs are safe in with the right set, in the right setting, and at the right time.&nbsp; And, of course, with proper medical precautions and screenings for predispositions to adverse effects.&nbsp; And accurate dosing.<br /><br />But besides that, everything is a poison at some level, and safe to consume at another level.&nbsp; DMT, water, cyanide, LSD, the whole lot.

				I&#039;d say psychedelics are the safest, both physically and psychologically. Specifically LSD, shrooms, mescaline, not so sure about the RCs but they seem safe in proper dosages. The rapid tolerance build up stops you from using them too often, so it&#039;s hard to get psychologically addicted. <br />I&#039;m glad they build up tolerance so fast actually, since I would probably end up tripping on every spare day I get haha. But I try to give it two weeks between trips :)<br /><br />For a friend who&#039;s never tried drugs, I would suggest pot, since it&#039;s mentally not too intense or unpredictable, like psychedelics can be.

				Everything is good, if you know how to measure your doses. <br />Well, if it&#039;s not some hardcore, life sucking drug.<br />Like crocodile.<br />But yes, i agree with this thread. Psychedelics is an intellectual drug. If you dumb, don&#039;t even try it. Because you can get some good trips and some bads. If you think rly smart, you never evern can get bad trips.

				Fuck if you want to stay safe what are you taking drugs for? <br />Stay home watch the telly with a packet of Tim Tams, that&#039;s safe. <br />Oh shit that&#039;s right, that leads to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and chronic belief in the validity of the system.<br /><br />The minute you started taking drugs, you opened your mind to an alternate reality. You never know, you may lose you <br />and find who you really are :)<br />Stay away from stuff that gives you a nasty habit, rash or will make you unpleasant for others to be around - unsafe for your friends and relatives.

				Really, all of them are pretty safe. It&#039;s pretty hard to OD on just one substance. Unless you do some dumb shit. it&#039;s the mixing of multiple CNS depressants that can be catastrophic. So no benzo&#039;s with opiates(oids) or alcohol. If you keep it to one substance and keep the dose reasonable, they are all safe. except that dern merijuanna. that ther weed is a noosence to soseyeity! HER&#039; HER&#039; .

				If you want to rate from safest to most dangerous, here is my list. Assuming you are using to get high, not for therapy. <br /><br />1. marijuana <br />2. mushrooms<br />3. LSD&nbsp; (this is only below mushies because it is easy to take waaayyyy too much and not have the trip you had expected. but it&#039;s still safe)<br />4. Benzos/alcohol (both have abuse potentials and if you get too deep down the rabbit hole, you will have some serious W/D.) Benzos are wonderful for coming down off of amphetamines. <br />5. Ampetamines. i.e. Adderall, Dexedrine, Methylphenidate. They are super awesome if you have to crunch out some papers in a short time, but a tolerance develops quickly, making you take higher doses for the same effects. If you take some later in the day. good luck getting to sleep. you will need it (assuming you use sparingly)<br />6. MDMA- only because if somebody gets a hold of pure molly, but is used to dropping of 500-600mg of &#039;street&#039; molly, well that&#039;s a recipe for an overdose. but at low doses it is really pretty safe.<br />7. cocaine/crack - only danger here is damaging your heart at a very young age if you tend to do a lot. you can also quickly develop a psychological addiction rather quick. that and jail. especially with crack. it just makes you so paranoid.<br />8. opiate/oids - if you are using them for recreation, odds are you will be addicted at one point. If you do want to get into that scene, please only use sparingly. like only when you NEED it. HINT: They SUCK for coming down from amphetamines, but are awesome for coming down from coke. Be careful doing this. It can lead to a very unhealthy addiction.<br />

There is no &quot;safe&quot; drug out there, this is because of the drug and the fact that the market is illegal with no quality control. <br /><br />ALL drugs cause harm. You need to understand where the harm comes from in your drug of choice. And then carry out actions to mitigate or reduce that harm, to use your drug in the safest way possible. <br /><br />Everybody is different, and will have different reactions to drugs. What you consider safe isn&#039;t true for someone else. First understand what harm your drug has, and then decide if you want to take it.<br /><br />How do we measure the harm done by drugs?<br /><br />Measuring harm is a complicated process. There are lots of different harms to be considered - deaths, mental health, illness, social problems like crime and violence. Some drugs are particularly harmful in one area but not others. And this balance can change over time as use and trends develop. <br /><br />A study in the UK, grouped harms into, harms against the person and harms against society. For example, Drug specific mortality and impairment of mental health or crime and economic cost. After this a technique called multi criteria decision analysis was used (Google it). In the end drugs where rated on a liner scale (0-100) with a higher number indicating more harm. <br /><br />The list starting with most harmful are<br /><br />1. Alcohol 72<br />2. Heroin 55<br />3. Crack 54<br />4. Meth 33<br />5. Cocaine 27<br />6. Tobacco 26<br />7. Amphetamines 23<br />8. Cannabis 20<br />9. GHB 19<br />10. Benzos 15<br />11. Ketamine 15<br />12. Methadrone 14<br />13. Mephedrone 13<br />14. butune 11<br />15. Anabolic Steroids 10<br />16. MDMA 9<br />17. Khat 9<br />18. LSD 7<br />19. Buprenorphine 7<br />20. Mushrooms 6 (include DMT, Mescaline, here)<br /><br />Reducing your harm <br /><br />As you can see everything on your list is rated as causing minimal harm. Only 2C-B is not on the list since little research has been done. You should practice harm reduction on the drug you are taking for example, make sure you follow simple guidelines on using psychedelics. A good place to start is http://howtousepsychedelics.org/ [clearnet]<br /><br />MDMA has recently been confirmed to cause cell damage. But again if you follow harm reduction, and use one to two times a month. Follow correct hydration guidelines and know that it is MDMA you are taking. You should be ok. <br /><br />Harms from psychedelics come from bad prep and too much being taken. Leading to overwhelming experiences in an unsafe environment.<br /><br />Read up on your drug science at: <br /><br />http://www.drugscience.org.uk/ [clearnet]<br /><br />Read this book<br /><br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drugs-Without-Minimising-Harms-Illegal/dp/1906860165 [clearnet]<br /><br />Take some time to understand the basic science around drugs, and you can take drugs safely, taking no more risks than crossing the road in some cases.<br /><br />Off your list - nothing would give great concern, MDMA is neurotoxic but less so than alcohol. On the psych front all are OK in low doses and good settings. An overdose doesn&#039;t mean death, you can overdose on LSD, this means you take too much and can no longer function. The higher the dose on psychedelics the more likely you are to have a negative, fearful experience that could cause lasting emotional damage. But none of this is a problem if you understand the harms and the risk. <br /><br />My personal opinion is that psychedelics are pretty safe, and much better when you are older. Psychedelics work better with greater life experiences to apply some context. <br /><br />Stay safe kids&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />FH<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. <br /><br />A 2C-B experience is said to be a cross between MDMA and LSD. But in practice it has its own signature.&nbsp; It is quite a different drug. <br /><br />To simplify, you get the social connection to people like MDMA, without being &quot;pushed&quot; into a loved up state. It feels like you have mental connection, but it can be more intellectual than emotional. But if you have an strong emotional connection with someone it will intensify it. <br /><br />You get the visuals of LSD, but without the head space. The head space can be clear, but logical thinking suffers a little. Large doses can be pretty confusing. You can get really interested and in to things, like reading, writing, watching telly. It can be very euphoric. <br /><br />The visuals can be really good, the world just sparkles and shines. Looking at stars on a clear night is great.<br /><br />Dosing correctly is very important on 2C-B. The dose response isn&#039;t linear. That is to say, a difference of 1mg can take you from a nice experience to one that is pretty overwhelming.&nbsp; A typical starting oral dose is around 15-20mg, then you work your way up to a level you are comfortable with. This is probably why it is not a &quot;street&quot; drug, you have to dose it well. Too much and you can end up in hospital. <br /><br />You can snort or plug (rectal administration) when you do this you should halve your dose. Because you avoid digestion and more of the drug is metabolised.<br /><br />The body load, i.e. the feelings and sensations, can be strong. More so if you take it orally, it can cause gas and sickness. But this is reduced if you snort or plug it. The tactile feedback is good, doing yoga or having a massage feels very nice, as is any sexual contact.<br /><br />Orally it comes on in 45-75 minutes and lasts 4-8 hours. Peak can last for 2-4 hours, and you feel like it is coming on in waves. Smoking weed can intensify the waves. <br /><br />Come down is pretty mellow, you return to a baseline with little hangover. Some people can even sleep on or after the peak.<br /><br />2C-B is a good drug for different settings. Sitting at home on your own, at a rave or party, out in nature, it can all work. Watch your dose on it, and in social settings you can feel a little anxious on larger doses. And larger doses cause more body load, increased heart rate, sickness etc.<br /><br />Mix it with MDMA and you will be in heaven. Take the MDMA first and then 1-2 hours later when you are just starting to peak. Take the 2C-B, they work really well together, and smooth out the MDMA come down.<br /><br />FH

				I don&#039;t consider any drug safe, each has a potential for fairly serious harm. That being said, I would say alcohol, weed, lsd, mdma, shrooms, and maybe 2c-b (but I haven&#039;t looked this up much)<br /><br />Of course all of these would have to be used very carefully

But the harm to the person carried more weight so it is still one of the most harmful drugs out there. You break alcohol down into the toxin acetaldehyde, which isn&#039;t that great for your liver or brain.<br /><br />The harm a drug can do is not judged by the legality of it. This shouldn&#039;t be your guideline, educate yourself using the current science. Opinions and anecdotes aren&#039;t good enough really.<br /><br />Check out sites like<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/ and https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum<br /><br />For good drug information.<br /><br /><br />
