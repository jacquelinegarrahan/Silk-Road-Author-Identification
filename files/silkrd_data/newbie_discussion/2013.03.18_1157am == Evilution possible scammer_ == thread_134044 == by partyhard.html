				Since I don&#039;t have time to spam my way all the way to 50 I&#039;ll post my experience with Evilution (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5103f516a7) here. This vendor has pretty high requirements to not have to FE and according to his feedback quite a few packages never arrive. I&#039;m one of them, 3 weeks after he confirmed shipping (twice!) I still haven&#039;t received anything (domestic order in Belgium the chances that it got seized are close to 0 so most likely he never shipped it). I&#039;ve had 3 successful orders with him in the past 2 months and always got fast communication and delivery (within days after my order was placed). 2 Days after I placed the order I placed another one (still trusting the vendor), I met the requirements to keep the money in escrow and its in the resolution center now. The vendor does not reply to my messages (last received message was a week ago and my send messages have never been read) but he still accepts orders (looking at his feedback all of them are FE orders so he&#039;s not dead/arrested/whatever). I am aware that its not likely I get the bitcoins back from the orders I FE&#039;d if he really is a scammer (or turns out to be legit anyways) but I like to make people aware of what is going on with this vendor so they don&#039;t make the same mistake as I did. Anyways, I&#039;ve learned my lesson the hard way and its the last time I FE even when the vendor is domestic. I rather wait a bit longer if that means I don&#039;t have to FE.<br /><br />Also, could someone with 50 posts post this in his feedback thread on my behalf? (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=60667.0)<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />

Thanks for quoting me on his feedback topic and I agree that vendors always require to give 5/5 ruins the feedback system. I also saw that he upped his requirements from 250$ and 5 completed orders to 500$ and 10 completed orders this could be an attempt to get more people to FE (and scam more?)

				Did you get your items?<br />I received a message from him in the resolution center for a 50% refund, wich I don&#039;t really agree with since he ignored all the communication before and most likely never sent it (3 domestic orders never arrived). What should I do, wait till an admin resolves it or just go with 50%?

				NEVER, EVER, NEVER, EVER deal with anyone that asks or requests for ANYTHING to do with FE or FINALIZING EARLY for ANYTHING.

Selective scamming is common practice, even with vendors that have great stats.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can understand your point, but &quot;never finalize early&quot; is easily said if you are a regular Silkroad customer.<br /><br />I think about 80% of the vendors asks to finalize early in the &#039;drugs&#039; catagory if your stats are &lt;250$ spent PLUS &lt;5 transactions, some even ask lately &lt;300$ spent PLUS &lt;10 transactions!<br /><br />If you are talking about MDMA you can probably find the 20% who isn&#039;t asking to finalize early. And I tell you, these are mostly vendors who just started. Who hardly do not have feedback (which is also a useless system now), oftenly have no stats at all, where hardly no one, or none at all talks about on the forum, where you even don&#039;t know if the vendor is police for instance, who takes your address in a buyers list, and last but not least, you don&#039;t know if they are professional as all important info is lacking on the vendor<br /><br />Evilution was one of the 3 sellers in Europe, one month ago, that sold 2C-B HCL powder in a zip lock bag (so not talking capsules).<br /><br />- Ivory in the UK, who is asking to finalize early too.<br />- Amsterdope in the Netherlands, who is asking to finalize early too.<br /><br />How would you order this product then?<br /><br />If all your regular buyers are saying not to finalize early to the newbies, I say all of you should report these vendors so Silkroad admins can close their accounts according to not asking for finalizing early. And I say another Silkroad will then come, where vendors can ask to finalize early, cause they are being scammed by buyers to oftenly on Silkroad.<br /><br /><br />Ohhh.... and by the way. Who is Blue Caterpillar from Belgium selling 2C-B and Hash, member for 17 days. Is this Evilution who was selling 2C-B and Hash? There were no other 2C-B HCL powder sellers in zip lock bags besides Evilution in Belgium, and when things go wrong suddenly there is Blue Caterpillar, even asking to finalize early if they think will losing money, and if you don&#039;t they cancel the order. Exactly the same like Evilution was asking in his message to me.
