				You have to pay quite a few bitcoins to be a vendor on the silk road, it would not make sense to scam the first few people, than be quickly outed as a scammer and than you just lost alot of money buying a vendor position.&nbsp; Its mostly those bitcoin sellers that seem to have the highest scam rate.&nbsp; also SR has escrow protection and just trust your gut.&nbsp; but things to watch out for is if they require FE and are not a established seller stay away.&nbsp; Normally to show proof of there products, many sellers hand write there vendor names next to there product to prove legitimacy.&nbsp; I would request him to take pictures of the actual product with a hand written sign of the vendor name and todays date.

				Stay away from him.<br />Stay with reputable vendors with perfect feedback. <br />Anything less might get you a whole lot less!<br /><br />PS Stay Away From PablosPuro. He is trying to scam a good friend of mine out of over $5,000 as you read this. Pablo has had his money for 2 months and won&#039;t give it back.<br /><br />I am familiar with the circumstances and I can&#039;t believe what a lying, cheating, scammer Pablo Really is. It is obvious after reading just a few of his Bull Shit Messages. He is a Thug to the true meaning.<br /><br />My friend said he will post the entire situation after SR has made a determination. Let&#039;s see how well they do their jobs of mediating and hope my friend gets his money back.<br /><br />SM

More reviews will surely come in the following week. Trust between vendor and buyer is of paramount importance to me. You might feel uneasy ordering 50g of hash from a new vendor, I also feel some anxiousness when a new buyer with no stats asks me &quot;dude you sell bulk? how much for 10oz?&quot;<br /><br />I can only say that I am trying my best to build an honest, sustainable and profitable business here on SR. I have been in regular trade for quite some time and am quite convinced of the fact that online sales is the future of this industry. Why are my prices on hexagram hash so low? Simply because I&#039;m awfully close to the source on this product. You are welcome, even advised to first try a smaller amount to assess the quality of my products and service. <br /><br />And have a fucking great weekend :)

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t think you can ever really &quot;know&quot; but you can use good judgement by following many of the suggestions offered so far... don&#039;t fe, search the forums, don&#039;t over order the first time, etc... since the vendor you mentioned has posted in this thread, click on their name and view the threads they have posted in and keep an eye on the feedback they are getting or will be getting.
