				I placed an order with a vendor, I won&#039;t yet name them, but he says in his vendor page that if you order before midnight, the package will be shipped the next day.&nbsp; I ordered at noon, and it is now noon of the next day, and it has still not gone out.&nbsp; Also, I have sent multiple messages, and the vendor has not even opened any of the messages, and yet he was online yesterday, and today.&nbsp; What should/can I do?

				I wouldnt panic just yet - im assuming the guy has good feedback and you checked his credentials. I expect you&#039;ll get a reply before they send the product. If they don&#039;t send you can cancel the order after 5 days of it being in processing - not the best, but its something.<br />Just sit tight they might just be really busy

				I did check the sellers credentials/feedback, and it is good.&nbsp; The one thing I was a bit nervous about was that he is new (less than 3 months).&nbsp; I have also since found out that he has been selling BK-MDMA when it is supposed to be MDMA.&nbsp; I&#039;m just not used to sellers ignoring the customer completely.&nbsp; Normally, they respond at the latest 12 hours later.&nbsp; But, I will be patient, and see what happens.&nbsp; Just hope that the value of bitcoins doesn&#039;t dramatically drop in the mean time.
