				Hey All!<br />As this is a new forum account, we could not post this anywhere else- maybe a mod could move it for us?<br />Anyways, this is the OFFICIAL CONTRABANDONDEMAND REVIEW THREAD.<br />If you order from us, please take the time to write a review of your experience here- let us know if you are willing to do so and we might throw in a little extra with your order. Any reviews good or bad will be greatly appreciated.<br />We will also post updates below periodically to let everyone know what is going on and what is coming up.<br />We have some very exciting new ideas &amp; products which we will hopefully be bringing you soon.<br />Thanks<br />CoD

				Ordered special offer for 1g of UK Hash, usually I smoke bud so only really ordered this because of the good value. Communication was friendly. Came next postal day, discreetly packaged. Included was a bit of bud and some new screens (which was ideal as desperately needed), so was impressed from the outset.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t smoke &#039;soap bar&#039; since a teenager so made me feel nostalgic, but this is much much nicer than the hash I used to buy locally, much cleaner. I don&#039;t have scales but looked a good amount. Had a few hits from my bong and feel very chilled, will be perfect for a mellow day but still be able to function.<br /><br />Basically very happy all round, would recommend ContrabandOnDemand and will definitely be a return customer.<br />&nbsp;;D&nbsp;
