				Hi guys, <br /><br />I recently placed an order with AussieUnderground for some green... About 4 days before Auto Finalize they messaged to say there was an issue with mould or something and that they had now sent it express... anyway I missed the window for hitting Resolve... now they are saying that they sent a refund... but I never asked for one or said anything to them since they said they had sent it so why would they refund me? Smells like I&#039;ve been screwed, anyone else in the same boat? <br /><br />They had good reviews, it was the only reason I ordered from them. Here&#039;s a copy/pasta of my conversation with them.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I didn&#039;t get a refund. Last message from you said you had been delayed and were sending it out, I hadn&#039;t since said I still didn&#039;t have it, why would you have refunded me?<br /><br />It&#039;s not the end of the world if you&#039;ve just kept my money but disappointing to say the least. Since you sent it express I assume you have a tracking number? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the records on here you were sent a full refund as the parcel was not able to be found. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi<br /><br />Didn&#039;t you get a refund sent through to you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still not received, how&#039;s it going? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#039;re welcome mate<br /><br />Everything is up to date now and all sent out.<br /><br />it&#039;s been a real crap fight, but can definitely ensure you&#039;ll love the smoke ;)<br /><br />Cheers&#039;<br />J. AussieUnderground &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks mate :) I appreciate the heads up and the explanation, it goes a long way to ensuring your customers don&#039;t have cause to worry.<br /><br />Have a good one &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be fine, We are doing our best to get the orders out express.<br /><br />All will be good.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />J. AussiesUnderground &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#039;s all good, hopefully I&#039;ll get it without issue. Please be aware if I haven&#039;t received it by the time auto-finalize comes up (4 days time) I&#039;ll have to hit resolve<br /><br />cheers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi and sorry for any delays. I take full responsibility for what has become a pest to us.<br /><br />We have had 2 major drama&#039;s here. #1. My dog Cheech seems to have been poisoned (either by eating some nasty baits put out by the council to stop foxes or an asshole neighbor that calls himself religious). I spent the weekend at the vets getting him sorted out, but it&#039;s a long story. #2. We seem to have not cured the choof properly and found that we had a severe mold problem with batch 2 :( and have had to source the quality needed from a fellow cultivator that we swapped some clones with (so the quality and mother are the same).<br /><br />This message has gone out to all of our little Mullions that are hanging out for a choof. Please note that we are adding a little extra gift to all orders that are running late, and do hope that you are not majorly pissed off with us. We will take care of all orders over the next 2 days. We are really so sorry for the problems, and can just ask you please enjoy what&#039;s coming as it is great!<br /><br />Please feel free to whinge and let us know how pissed you are with us, as we do understand people need to vent.<br /><br />If we find a message that needs to be dealt with in a special way, we will deal with each complaint on a case by case basis.<br /><br />Our sincerest apologies.<br />J. AussieUnderground &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what&#039;s the outcome here? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />TimTams553 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used a random name... but the postcode was XXXXXXXXX<br /><br />cheers :) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br />AussieUnderground(98) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi<br /><br />Just for your security,<br /><br />Can you please reply with the postcode you ordered with, and either the first or last name the package was going to. I will be able to chase it up for you from there.<br /><br />Cheers&#039;<br />J.

Just wanted to say hi, let you know my intentions are clean and that I hope to continue to do business with you in future. I&#039;m fairly new myself so I hope this is OK for you, please just let me know if there is anything I can do to ease your concerns should you have any.<br /><br />Also, are you able to say if I will have this by easter friday?<br /><br />Thanks mate<br />-553</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				sounds too premature to make a judgement call on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;oy should have waited&nbsp; little longer before doing a cut paste like this. and the topic title is only deserving if its been a week or more and all ends are exhausted. you should have continued conversation. then gone thru SR support.. if all elose fails then you can come here and use a vendors name and scammer in the same title.<br /><br />get a tracking number from them, check it yourself.. if they remark on ur post here say sorry.. if it gets nassty go to SR support. your last post to them u shot yourself in the foot<br /><br />you only just pissed off the vendor.. i dont vend but i think its hard work.

When I asked where it was ten days later they didn&#039;t say anything about the mould issues. They responded but it wasn&#039;t until after they replied again 3 days later that they came out with that mould story. The whole thing is incredibly fishy. They also went from saying &quot;everything has been sent, enjoy&quot;, i asked again where it was 8 days after that and they responded with &quot;didn&#039;t you get the refund?&quot;. Why would they give me a refund? I didn&#039;t ask for one, they didn&#039;t offer it to me and of course - I haven&#039;t received the refund.<br /><br />Their reviews were good but it&#039;s not unheard of for vendors to either fake the reviews or sell good for a while then just go bad. It wasn&#039;t a great deal of money but if they&#039;ve taken it, it&#039;s a disappointment nonetheless and it shows the rating and feedback system can&#039;t be relied upon.<br /><br />I hope for everyone&#039;s sake I am wrong, I certainly don&#039;t want to step on anyone&#039;s toes, but the situation speaks for itself.

				Did you actually get your coins back though? Pretty hard to say you were scammed if you didn&#039;t lose any BTC.
