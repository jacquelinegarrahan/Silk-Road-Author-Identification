				Regarding this thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=167955.msg1197875#msg1197875<br /><br />bro i feel u. I played docs gambling lotto and won. I have now waiting since a week to get my complete win back. Wrote to doc no reply. Didn&#039;t FE so not in any rush. couple of days left till I can resolve the issue. Anyway the doc the gambling game out of the listing. Doc was at 96 when I played his game now he is at 89. Did search on reddit and found nothing now finally found a thread where&nbsp; someone is having a problem with doc too.<br /><br />btw 7 days ago doc wasn&#039;t in stealth mode, now he is

				i was also sucked in to the FE sample scam run by the doc and am amazed he thinks he can get a sale with his feedback and rating. it was at 58 last i looked. there was feedback posted in the last 24hrs about him being arrested and refund/reships being offered. i messaged him querying the validity of this comment which he read but failed to respond to.<br />im guessing he was banking on no one kicking up to much of a stink because of the low value of individual funds lost but when you go thru a few pages of feedback he made a good 600-700 usd. he was only a vendor for 1 month&nbsp; prior so if he just opens a new vendor account he still comes out on top, doesnt he? im not aware of the current vendor bond amount. I think thats the question. is it cheaper to send out the pitifully small orders and recoup the majority of his lost vendor rating or just open a new vendor account.
