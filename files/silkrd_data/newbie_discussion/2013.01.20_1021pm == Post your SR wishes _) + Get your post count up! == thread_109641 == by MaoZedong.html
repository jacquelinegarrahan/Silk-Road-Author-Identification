				As newbies to the forums, we are not yet allowed to post requests for products. Instead, I made you guys this little SR wishes thread for you to post all your little SR wishes.<br /><br />Do you wish that they would do away with the newbies section?<br />Do you wish that dutchaanbod would return to his former glory?<br />Do you wish that someone would offer tanks of medical grade nitrous?<br />Do you wish that all vendors would package smelly items in mylar?<br /><br />I personally wish that tessellated would offer sheets for around $700 or less because his L is just too fire.
