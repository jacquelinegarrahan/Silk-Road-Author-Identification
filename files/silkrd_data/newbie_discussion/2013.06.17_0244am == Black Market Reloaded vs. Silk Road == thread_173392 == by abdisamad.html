				think the silk road forum is pretty useful, it&#039;s very active and a good way to find reviews of vendors and so on which maybe isn&#039;t so great at BMR? I am a member of both but never ordered anything from BMR as I never really found enough info about a vendor/product to feel comfortable handing over my address and sending off my coins. Dunno if BMR offers the same in terms of escrow/resolution center either. tbh I didn&#039;t really pursue BMR route after making a successful few orders here so maybe they have great stuff that I&#039;ve missed, but SR works pretty good for me, good levels of support from community and mods and DPR etc. <br /><br />TL;DR It&#039;s all about the vibez.

				BMR seemed shady, so I went with SR and everything worked out great. The fact that they had a post on there to buy a mail bomb and kill someone really turned me off. I&#039;d think LE would be watching that site more then SR because of that. Just my opinion.

				It&#039;s interesting to compare the prices between the two sites. I&#039;ve noticed a lot of things being cheaper on SR but a few things that are cheaper on BMR. One thing I am really curious about and considering buying from BMR is moonshine. There is a listing on there for a pint of &quot;apple pie moonshine&quot; <br />(fucking yum) for like 20 bucks and I&#039;m really interested.. I would love to see if anyone has bought this and how it worked out.

				The cops sadly don&#039;t care about weapons as much as the media would have us believe. When I got busted, I lied and pretended I was going to &quot;help the cops and help myself&quot; &lt;eye roll&gt;. I wanted information on how to spot a snitch... they thought I was the guy buying drugs (I was); but I was selling a lot too. Ha. Playing with the narcs, I asked if they wanted guns. They recoiled and said, &quot;No, no... no guns. We don&#039;t deal with guns!&quot; Fucking pussies.... At least local cops operate like this. I&#039;m sure as long as you aren&#039;t known to have links to &quot;terrorism&quot; in their eyes, LE doesn&#039;t care what you do with guns. Y&#039;all heard of &quot;Operation Fast and Furious&quot;? The ATF watched guns they sent cross the border... then the guns showed up at cartel execution/mass grave sites. Go AMERICA!!!<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				theres plenty of demand for the sorts of things both sites sell... and BMR offers weapons too, whereas SR doesnt.<br /><br />i used BMR once, during the DoS attacks on SR, and it worked out fine. i just like the SR forum environment better, it makes me a lot more comfortable being able to find masses of info on vendors i&#039;d like to buy from. plus generally theres a bigger selection on SR.

				I think BMR also offers counterfit bills which I had an interest in. Though I&#039;ve never bought anything form BMR. IME that site is not as stable as SR. I have to do a lot of reloads and such between the different pages.
