				Is it down for you guys as well or is it just me? I have a time sensitive purchase to make and this is really killing my vibe. And for future reference is there any way to tell if the site is down besides asking the forum?

				Same as me, only asked as someone on another part of the forum was using a fake link which was down. Apparently fake links are posted on Wikipedia etc every so often in the hope people with bitcoins in stock type in there passwords then get wiped out. Not sure why yours wouldn&#039;t be working&nbsp; :&#039;(

				What is the error you are getting in your browser? That means a lot to us technocrats.<br /><br />Try Use New Identity on Vidalia and you will get routed through a brand new circuit. To me: three of those not working is down.<br /><br />As I said though, the error means a lot. Most of the time the error will tell us if it&#039;s Tor&#039;s problem or DPR&#039;s.<br /><br />DPR is like a rocket ship I&#039;ve noticed with telling us here.<br /><br />It was down for me, but only until I clicked refresh so I have no idea if it is related. All seems well to everyone else though.

				When I first arrived to The Silk Road, a few months back, it moved like a turtle and drove me crazy. Then, all of a sudden, it start working fast, like any other website.&nbsp; They must have done something to improve the site, and I am loving it. No more getting signed off just from trying to get to the next page. <br /><br />I hope you figure out what is going on and soon!<br /><br />Cheers!

				^^^^ the site and the forum seem to operate indepedently as I&#039;ve been able to access the forum but not the site in many occasions. <br /><br />Damn its usually not down this long for me unless the whole site is down...guess thats not the case since some of you guys are able to get on. I&#039;m using this link: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ <br /><br />Really wish it would just work. Jumoed thru so many hoops to get the BTC here and now this&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />The error I&#039;m getting is &quot;can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at *silk road URL*&quot;

				Well I am now able to log on only after unistalling the Tor browser and reinstalling it. You should try that if you can&#039;t still get on. Seems to be moving a bit quicker as well.
