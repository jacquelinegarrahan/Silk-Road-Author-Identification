				I was introduced to the SR through a friend of mine who needed an address to send his &#039;goodies&#039; to (in exchange for a portion) because he wasn&#039;t comfortable having it go through the University mail service at his dorm. I was wasted when he asked me and wasn&#039;t entirely sure what the SR was or how it worked, all I knew was I would be getting free drugs. *skip ahead about a week* I got a plain looking envelope in the mail with my buddies name on it. I call him up, he comes over, we open it. Lo and behold! 3.5grams of MDA<br /><br />I was floored! I never expected SR to deliver in such a legit way. <br />So after a significant amount of reading, <br />here I am with only a few questions left before I feel comfortable enough to make a purchase.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got an account and spent a significant amount of time browsing.<br />I understand the use of bitcoins within the context of the Silk Road <br />and I&#039;ve got my wallet set up through Electrum.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to use a money order, so I found this site: btcQuick.com<br />which will accept a debit card for a slightly higher rate<br />Can anyone vouch for them? Or recommend something similar?<br /><br />From there, I deposit the coins into my wallet, then to SR.<br />I put the item in my cart. Grab the Public Key on the Vendor&#039;s page<br />and use this site: https://www.igolder.com/pgp/encryption/&nbsp; to encrypt<br />my address. Finally filling out the order form and submitting.<br /><br />Am I missing anything?<br /><br />-Much Love

				Everything sounds good to me.&nbsp; If i were you i would just make sure that you are getting the best deal for the bitcoins.&nbsp; I havent heard of btcQuick.com, but that doesnt mean they are no good.&nbsp; You might want to look into bitinstant or localbitcoins to see if you can get a better price for bitcoins.<br /><br />

				I would suggest you don&#039;t use any of your personal information to purchase BTC to be used on SR <br />e.g. debit cards, bank accounts or visa<br />just in case the purchase can be traced back to you.

				Check this listing out if you don&#039;t want to wait hours after sending your bitcoins for them to show up in your wallet and risk fluctuation + coins aren&#039;t traceable to you:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/67542d94dc<br /><br />Check this listing out if you want to buy Bitcoins using a moneypak (anonymous and easy):<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4c3b908a4a<br /><br /><br />You&#039;re welcome.
