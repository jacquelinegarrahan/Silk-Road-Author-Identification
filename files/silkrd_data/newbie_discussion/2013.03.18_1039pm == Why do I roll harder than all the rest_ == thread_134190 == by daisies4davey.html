				I recently got back into eating some rolls again.&nbsp; Not sure why I stopped in the first place.&nbsp; I really haven&#039;t tried to find any since &#039;99 or 2000ish.&nbsp; Along came SR and basically I have found the best of the best.&nbsp; My question is this:&nbsp; I roll my fucking balls off!&nbsp; everytime.&nbsp; I am tired of telling my wife and friends how bad ass some of these beans are because they just look at me with jealousy in their eyes.&nbsp; They say &quot;Yeah they are legit&quot;&nbsp; &quot;but I wanna roll like you&quot;&nbsp; I have a basic diet that most healthy 9-5 workers have.&nbsp; I dont take any meds.&nbsp; I enjoy only the best buds when they are around.&nbsp; I am normal.&nbsp; What can these people do to get off like me?&nbsp; I am I just plum full of Seretonin?&nbsp; Is their any chemisty that may help?&nbsp; Bloody hell!&nbsp; Any combos.&nbsp; Pre roll rituals?&nbsp; I am not complaining trust me.&nbsp; Not complaining.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s a million factors.&nbsp; Perhaps you just have a naturally lower tolerance.&nbsp; I&#039;d say to &#039;roll balls&#039; your average person needs somewhere in the .1 to .25g range.&nbsp; .25 is high granted and might cause people to puke.<br /><br />Diet matters.&nbsp; Nobody should eat anything too heavy within several hours.&nbsp; Some of my hardest rolls have been on empty stomachs...

				I agree about the tolerance theory.&nbsp; But are their tricks to give my girl a head start?&nbsp; I dont want to roll less I want them to roll more.&nbsp; We have tried the old &quot;Well take some more&quot; trick.&nbsp; It helped but I find myself continuing past everyones come down.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am so sad for them.&nbsp; Well kinda it makes me feel guilty a bit.&nbsp; Last couple of times I try to play it cool.&nbsp; But its like that fucking laugh that you are supposed to hold in and when you blurt it out it feels like the funniest shit ever.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp;

				You could just be fortunate and have particular sensitivity to MDMA. Anther possibility is that what you call &quot;rolling your balls off&quot; is what another person calls &quot;pleasant&quot;, MDMA experiences are subjective and it&#039;s really hard to compare your experience to another&#039;s.

				Regardless of whether your tolerance is low or not, your lucky if you roll hard. I never really lost the magic, but it the first few times were really pure magic.

				Its all about density, more dense objects will roll harder in a given gravitational field.

				Your personal biology can definitely play a factor, but so can your mindset. Perhaps you are the kind of person that can more easily accept and enjoy the experience.
