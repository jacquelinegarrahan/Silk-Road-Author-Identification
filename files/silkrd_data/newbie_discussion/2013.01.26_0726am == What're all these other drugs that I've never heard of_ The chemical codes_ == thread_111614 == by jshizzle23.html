				You need to read PiKHAL and TiKHAL to be up on all of the different &quot;RC&quot;&#039;s or research chemicals, which is a horrible misnomer that implies some sort of extra risk which isn&#039;t really there.&nbsp; PiKHAL deals with phenethylamines, mostly mescaline analogues with a 2,4,5-trisubstituted phenethyl (2C-X) or alpha-methylphenethyl (DOX) moiety.<br /><br />Just like any new drug (and most of those are by no means new anymore as they&#039;re ~30-40yr old), it is difficult to predict long-term/rare adverse events from said drug.

				Research Chems. Probably want to do some research of your own before you dive in to the weird chemicals.

See my main meph man Wertu on SR he is doing a special opening price for 0.15btc a gram and it kicks ass his delivery is also free and if you dont like it you can easily pass it off on the street as pre ban M-Cat and get £30 a gram for it. All i know about the rest is the ones starting with 2 are normally psychadelics dude. good luck with your 4-mec or M1 as its more commonly known as buddy</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
