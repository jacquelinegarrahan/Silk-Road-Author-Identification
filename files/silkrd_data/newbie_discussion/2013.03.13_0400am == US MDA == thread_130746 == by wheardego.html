				This beautiful product seems a bit understocked in general, and to complicate, I&#039;m looking for a US source. I&#039;m spooked by international shipments. US customs is tough. I have seen ads by an ILF or something, love foundation? Any experience with them? All ads seem to be down today, don&#039;t know what that means. <br />Any quality us suppliers, even mdma if it comes to that?<br />Also, any comments on recieving international shipments, especially canada.<br />respect.

				I have used the ILF <br /><br />Shipping only took a few days USA to USA<br /><br />Product had a yellow tint to it but was good.&nbsp; This was a while ago when they had deals because they were&nbsp; a new vendor but I would assume it&#039;s the same stuff still being pumped out. <br /><br />MDA is rare because the yields a chemist will get making MDA vs MDMA are significantly less.&nbsp; Plus most people will prefer MDMA.<br /><br />My guess is the ILF knows there is a market for MDA though.&nbsp; They can see no one else is making it so they take the loss in yield.&nbsp; It&#039;s really the same as making MDMA except you take a few less steps.

				I have bought off of ILF. It&#039;s very good. I plan on buying more. 1 gram would last you a long time if it&#039;s for personal amounts. It&#039;s very strong. Highly recommended.
