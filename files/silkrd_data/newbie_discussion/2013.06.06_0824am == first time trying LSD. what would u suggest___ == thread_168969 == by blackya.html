				Hi guys,<br />So I am going to try for the first time LSD in my life.<br /><br />Shortly about myself: <br />In my life I have had experience with salvia, some other hallucinogen pills but no other psychodelics<br /><br />I am gonna be alone. Unfortunately no sitter.... and I am gonna try 115mcg prepared from rosé crystal. Is it too much or too less for the first time? is it too dangerous when first time alone and without sitter?<br /><br />I will be very thankful if u share your opinions and suggestions<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				if you are in a good state of mind you should be fine. remember set and setting will affect your trip, so make sure you are in a good place both emotionally and physically/geographically. I think 115ug is perfect for a first time.

				thanx for the quick answer.<br /><br />some friends suggest to go to the forest to enjoy there the most of the trip.<br />but alone is maybe dangerous to be in the forest, what if I get lost&nbsp; :o :o :o, hahaha)))<br />so probably taking it at home alone.<br />mood is fine and great, physically is also all ok.<br />it is just this excitement of not knowing how it hits u which makes me afraid. <br /><br />

				for me I prefer to be in nature when I trip, I find it to be very pleasing and relaxing. with 115ug you will be able to function normally so I wouldnt worry about getting lost or anything. if you prefer to be at home then do that. put on some relaxing music, look at some art or create some art, you will have a great time.

				ok, I get your point&nbsp; :)<br />I understand it like this that one blotter of 115mcg would give me a nice feeling without hard emotional experience,. <br /><br />anyway my aim is to explore a bit my inner EGO or my hidden soul, or if u want that my &quot;third eye&quot; gets a bit open&nbsp; :o :o ::) ::) I guess u understand what I mean. But maybe it is then too dangerous to trip like this when being alone. Like my vendor told me if I want to be not able to speak&nbsp; :D :D but at the same time be able to see my inner psycho, I should take 3-4 blotters&nbsp; 8) 8) 8)&nbsp; but it will be in my case a suicide, especially when alone and no one else looking after. <br /><br />Or what do u think if I start with one blotter, see how it works and then some hours later another blotter to reach the point where psycho or &quot;the third eye&quot; could get a bit open, but a bit, not too too much)))<br />I am not afraid, but having no sitter makes me feel I should be very careful with the substance<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Just be in a good mood for one thing, then be some where safe when you start your trip.&nbsp; Only have people that care about you around until you know how you are going to be affected.&nbsp; I always like to have my House Clean from top to bottom before trips.&nbsp; Also have all my drinks I want there and cold.&nbsp; Also some munchies but guaranteed you wont eat much at all your first few trips.&nbsp; If you want some advice on Purchasing LSD check out the LSD Vendor review here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; They have a list of the best Vendors but I pick the King of SR Albion here is his page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3193205b49.&nbsp; For first trip 200-400 mics will be super fine. Some are ok with 110 their first trip.<br /><br />&nbsp; Some of my best trips have been by myself in my home with a bunch of movies and Ganja!!! With Albions LSD you will only need one hit for first trip and his is CLEAN TOO! I resell his stuff in the states because its so clean. So go to Albion for a real deal!<br /><br /><br />

				Hello there!<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;d say that anything under 200µg is a &quot;safe&quot; trip :) You don&#039;t lose your mind or anything and you&#039;ll probably regret you didn&#039;t do more once the trip kicks in ;) Nature is great for tripping! Just bring some nice music you like to listen to and let your mind take you adrift on a journey you&#039;ll never forget :D<br /><br />Hope this helped!<br /><br />~Best regards

				&nbsp;:) Thanks for asking this question.&nbsp; I think I prefer the walk in the woods kind of experience. My house will make me see things that need done so I can&#039;t enjoy as much. I already feel trippy whenever I am alone in the woods behind the house. I know nothing can hurt methere, well maybe a rabid coyote or a serial killer or an elephant escaping from the nearby zoo,&nbsp; but that&#039;s all, unless the horses across the street stampede again, or&nbsp; I fall into the lake and the giant alligator turtle bites my leg off, but other than that, I think it&#039;s the perfect place to trip. Now to find the perfect vendor.&nbsp; ;D

				Dont go alone in the woods, thats retarted. When LSD kicks in, you will have no fucking idea what&#039;s going on. LSD doesnt just make you see stuff, it makes you think<br />differently. Entirely. You will not be under control. Bring at least one friend.

I kind of understand that unpredictable things could happen. It was like this when I tried salvia for the first time. ok, it lasted just 5 minutes but in those 5 minutes that part of my brain which still able somehow to understand that it was me(Blackya and not somebody else) got a demonic fear that all will stay forever like this (actually trip experience was really frightening and scary) and besides I remember I could not positionate myself to this world, it felt like everything broke down and there is no past and no future, just this one moment of now and here. And it was just 5 minutes trip, nothing to compare to lsd trip which is some hours or even more.<br /><br />So, I dont know, would u also agree with some other people who gave their opinion today here saying that for the first time and no sitter 1 blotter of 115mcg would make no harm??

				I don&#039;t know what would happen if you took 115µg, so I will reply based on my 150µg trip. Never tried salvia, but LSD is fucking strong. You will not know that you&#039;re blackya. <br />There will be times when you&#039;ll realize who you are, but just for a few seconds. Most of the times you&#039;ll be laughing or doing some other crazy shit. But the body and the mind <br />will be taken from you.<br />DO NOT do this without at least one friend and especially not in the woods. It&#039;s ideal for it, yes, but with a cabin - a place to sleep. I was very tired when the trip ended. I can&#039;t imagine the<br />number of things that could go wrong for you. You could get injured, lost, dehydrated...<br />What you experienced on salvia is called a bad trip. It can happen on LSD and if it does, you&#039;re fucked. It wont be minutes in fear, it will be hours. Your sitter should get some kind of benzodiazepine in case this happens.<br />It&#039;s a substance present in medicine for anxiety (xanax, rohypnol, neurol etc.). If you&#039;ll have a bad trip, take 1 mg. If it doesnt work for you sufficiently within 45 minutes (you should sleep or at least be calm),<br />tell him to give you another 0.5. <br /><br />Bro, just listen to me - LSD can go wrong in a number of ways and you should have people around you.

				Hi! I think 115 ug at home, without a sitter should be OK. This dose is not too high, but then again, each individual has a different sensitivity to LSD. Put some nice music, turn off the, phone, relax, and you will enjoy the trip. This will give you a taste of LSD, and you can always explore higher doses later. However, I personally find that I need at least 2-3 blotters (taken all at once) to have a truly psychedelic experience.<br /><br />Doing LSD in nature is also wonderful, particulary at dawn or at dusk, since the lighting effects under LSD are heavenly. However, if this is your first time I would do it at home, since you will be in a more controlled environment.

Only take 1 dose to see how you can handle it. A strong hit of salvia has fucked me up wayyyy worst than acid ever could. So if you have even done that, don&#039;t expect it to be anything similar. I just did some from JerseyCow the other day and it was one of the best experiences of my life.

But sure no one knows how you will react for first timers it would be the best choice to have tripsitter. It&#039;s like i said i&#039;m harduser which take sometimes 6 drops a 100mic distributed throughout the evening on a party. But what is hot for me to be cold for you....everyone experiences it differently. 3weeks before when my tolerance was at 0 i dropped 2x drops from JORs TOC and a half spongebob.....it was amazing and the trip should have had 250mcg but there was no ego-loose.<br /><br />As i said it&#039;s different from person to person.<br /><br />I would say it&#039;s different from acid to acid....at least it feels like it. <br /><br />My advise, if you&#039;re unsure take a tripssitter. Forest walks alone on acid only on daytime and known areas but not the first experience.....nobody knows what will happen.<br /><br />Namasté

				A bad trip does not come from bad acid, it comes from a bad setting that puts your mind in that state. You&#039;re the owner and operator of your brain and LSD will prove that to you. It&#039;s awesome to trip alone but you need to plan out your trip before you take anything. Don&#039;t make anything to hard, because you may not be able to figure it out. Just about anything you choose to do, you will find some pleasure in. When you first start to feel the effects, you will sweat and feel like your heart is racing. It&#039;s not, stay calm. Listen to music, turn the lights out. Don&#039;t worry if what you see is real, enjoy it.

				I have heard LSD is normally tasteless but this one had a light sour taste. Is it normal?<br /><br />My first LSD experience:<br />So I was alone and no sitter. It was 13:00 on the clock when I took this one blotter of 115 mcg.&nbsp; 40 minutes later the first effects came. It was really cool at the beginning, nice visuals, good mood, feeling really high, no strange thoughts. After a while I felt that my flat starts to be too small for my me, so I decided to go for a walk and to find a place outside where I could be in the nature with trees around and hopefully no people. During my 2 hours walk outside I did not find a place where I would be alone. My mood became also very negative. There were people everywhere and it was annoying and depressing, also in those 2 hours walking around I experienced the most awful, controversial, miserable, tragic and crazy thoughts: there have been moments where my Ego was totally lost and I could not explain a simple thing to myself, I could not understand why people live on earth as well I did not know what I do on this planet in this very moment (now I understand why sitter is needed, especially for the first time&nbsp; ;) ). Sometimes all was again clear and I was just saying to myself that all is fine and that it is just acid which makes me feel this way. I was also very thirsty but I had no guts to buy water, I was sure people would see I am on drugs and as I said earlier I was very confused when I was outside on the street. Finally I reached the railway station, I thought I buy water there. I was really shocked at the railway station: too many people around and walking too close to me and most of them with really weird, ugly and demon-alike looking faces, too many voices, sounds, shops, colours, train announcements, police walking around and so on. I did not like it at all, it was very unpleasant. <br />After it I came back home because I felt tired after walking around for 2 hours. I came home, drank milk, took a shower, started to vomit, felt really lost again. Also inside of me I was again confused and did not know what to do. I wished my trip would be over. Physically it felt rather uncomfortable. <br />But after a while I came down and I started to feel again very good. I had again my good mood back, physically I felt being high. I started to enjoy it again. I also prepared some pasta to eat. <br />At night I felt like I want this trip to be over. Somehow it was enough for the first time, my body was tired and I was tired from those million of thoughts I had in my head. I smoked weed, it felt again very cool and funny. But some hours later I could not stand it any longer and went to bed. Of course there was no chance to fall asleep. As I said before, my body was very tired and begging for sleeping but my mind dominated the whole situation and all I could do was to walk around from one room into another and back and so on. In this way I hoped I could find my peace to fall asleep. <br /><br />So to summarize it: I stayed awake for around 34 hours, I felt like tripping for around 18 hours of which 12-13 hours were really tripping and the rest was this coming down. And the come-down was quite awful, I did not like it, I wished I could have had some benzos to stop it.<br /><br />But generally I liked my first trip, it was nice and interesting experience. I would love to try it again. <br />What I did not like mostly (and this I have written some lines above) was the come-down and sometimes this very unpleasant feeling on the physical level. <br />Today I feel fine but still very tired and a bit confused/lost.<br /><br />I think now I also understand what is meant when people speak about the purity of LSD. Please correct me if I am wrong: It is what one feels on the physical level, some vendor write in their descriptions that the trip is mild and pleasant. <br />As I have said earlier my trip was not always&nbsp; mild and pleasant, sometimes it felt really heavy, terrible and uncomfortable.<br /><br />I would appreciate if u guys share some thoughts and ideas of yours and also if u could give some tips for the future trips of mine&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thank u<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				LSD is tasteless but that does not mean what you have is not LSD. LSD comes in a crystal form, to get it on paper it must be dissolved in alcohol, like everclear. When the sheets are dipped in the solution and brought out, the alcohol evaporates and LSD is all that&#039;s left on the paper. When done right, you don&#039;t taste anything.<br /><br />It sounds like you tripped but being around a lot of people was probably not the best thing for a first time. When taking LSD you want to be able to control the situation, control the direction of the trip. Being around a bunch of people that are not tripping will make you feel paranoid and out of the loop. Not the same thing if your in a group of people who are also tripping.<br /><br />It&#039;s good your trip is over and you enjoyed it. You know what to expect for next time and I would check with other people who bought from the vendor to see if their paper also had a sour taste.

				The best way to do it would be to take about 3-5 blotters and go to your local shopping mall for a wander around, you will love it !

				you may choose to seek purity, and/or that which is pristine... ...in all of it - life... this may be a lesson i have learned from experience with lsd... maybe you, too, will continue to gain and reflect brilliant insight from lsd experiences!<br /><br />now you have some loose frame for which to reference future dealings with lsd. you have the opportunity to plan events which will allow for your preferred state of being, albeit a new and ambiguous state of being, which may prove pesky to predict,,, but hey - id be willing to gamble that if you aim for top purity lsd, dial in your dose range, and experience, experience, experience.... well... i suppose that you will probably learn how to function with a whole gaggle of the molecules in your network. <br /><br />with the above attained, you&#039;ll probably already have a skill set coming together. a skill set most assuredly specific to you. and you know... its funny how some things work... <br /><br />on the topic of being lost, geographically: regularly, when i see an area and think oh wow i&#039;d like to peruse this joint whilst dosed, i STILL (or perhaps its more like recently, via the advent of aging... ) think hey whatre the chances i&#039;d become super misplaced in the whole thing and have to actually work to surface? alas we are reminded of the process of effort... <br /><br />anyway... i could talk all morning.... but it is now siesta time..... <br /><br />take care blackya... if you are searching for something that it is brilliant, ultra-sentient light, i hope you find it.
