				I was wondering if torbrowser needs to be installed on your mac or if I can just put it on a thumb drive, plug it in and run it off that.<br />That way all I would have to do is unplug the pin drive and have no evidence of any tor related activity on my computer??<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about bootable pin drives but the tor browser name is different then the one mentioned on the thread so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s as safe as tor browser run off a computer. Or the pin drive idea I was talking about above.

				You can definitely put Tor Browser Bundle on a USB and run it from there ... or even maybe encrypt the USB first and put TBB into a hidden volume (using TrueCrypt).&nbsp; Or, you can use Tails .... but you&#039;d be better off using it as a LiveCD/DVD setup simply because getting it to boot from a USB with Tails on it has proven pretty damn difficult.

				well shit, I have to look into everything you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />I was hoping I could just drag the tor browser onto a pin drive so I can plug that pin drive in, double click the file and run from there.<br /><br /><br />What do you think is the absolute safest and anonymous way to connect, get a bootable pin drive or get a bootable dvd (it would have to be a DVD external drive because my comp doesn&#039;t have a cd drive. I could also remove the hard drive if that would be even more secure.<br /><br />SO WOULD YOU SAY TrueCrypt IS THE SAFEST USB BOOTABLE METHOD? Like what the high ranking anonymous vendors use or something??<br /><br />Thanks for the reply btw

				Oh, or is Tails the ultimate security despite the setup difficulty?

				Not to thread jack but what precautions need to be taken after all the files are put on an encrypted drive? <br />I am aslo about to change to an encrypted USB Fused. i would appreciate it x1000 if you could just put together a simple 5 step tut on how to do it &amp; post back on this thread. It would help me a lot.
