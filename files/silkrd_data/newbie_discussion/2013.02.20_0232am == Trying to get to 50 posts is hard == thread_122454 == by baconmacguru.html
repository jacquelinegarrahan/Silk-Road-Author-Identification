				Im sitting here trying to figure out how to post replies in the discussion forum, i read all the OMG READ ME FIRST posts but none seem to outline the rules for new users regarding where you can post and how many posts you need for certain sections. Also people marked as &quot;guest&quot; are able to reply to posts even though im not and im registered... seems a bit weird for an otherwise well organized forum.

				One of the greats in your profile pic, posting seems to get kind of annoying with the combination of the errors when someone else posts while your posting and the general inherent slowness. Looks like you figured it out though.

Were selling 1 gram of Mephedrone (pre-ban stuff no bullshit) for only £10.50 including postage($17)! ! ! !*<br /><br />£10.50 including postage /($17)<br />£10.50 including postage /($17)<br /><br />This is for a full 1.0 gram bag. Super stealth delivery and definitely pure 4-MMC unlike other mephedrone with added alternative analogues.<br />&nbsp;<br />As this is our grand opening SALES, its only going to be for a short duration of time!
