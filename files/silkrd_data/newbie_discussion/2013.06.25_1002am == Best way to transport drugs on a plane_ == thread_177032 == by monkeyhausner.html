				Cap it and then get one of those vitamin bottles with the large capsules full of powder. Open them, take some out, and nestle your caps inside. Re-fill a bit and put the top back on and you can travel worry free! A tip would be to mark your special caps with something otherwise you will have to open a bunch of caps to find them.

				My mate has brought a few grams of coke to Ibiza every time we have gone. Normally not telling us until we arrive! haha. He just put it in his checked luggage inside a a wax container or gel or something which was inside something else in the middle of his bag. Never been an issue.

				Two years ago me and a few mates went from UK to Ibiza, my friends girlfriend at the time put five grams of MDMA wrapped in cling film in a condom and inserted it up her pussy. I wouldn&#039;t take the risk but she was fine all through customs and apparently did the exact same the following year they returned. <br /><br />I personally wouldn&#039;t want to put a condom filled with drugs up my anus as reckon which ever country you go to in the EU isn&#039;t going to be that hard to find drugs. If you know the address of where you are staying why not organize a SR package to be sent there under a fake name.

				Yeah but now at Manchester at least and I presume everywhere else, they have the full body scanners in security. If there is any part of the condom outside the body sticking out which there will be either pussy or ass haha then you gots a problem. Checked luggage all day! There is no way they could have the time to scan in so much detail to uncover every person who has stashed a tiny amount of gear. They are too busy looking for kilos of drugs, guns and bombs

I usually don&#039;t even take the bottle out of my pocket when I go thru the metal detector, just keep it and my paper money in my pocket so the security guys don&#039;t try to steal anything. I&#039;d guess that something close to half of the people on any given plane have prescription drugs with them, and I&#039;ve never seen any one asked about their meds.

				The best method that works for little amounts for substances like benzos, amphetamine, buprenorphine and maybe other opioids is to make a clear solution or (if not possible) a suspension.<br /><br />Just filling the solution/suspension into a suitable (liquid) medicines bottle will do the job. Suitable medicines may be Cough-Drops, wound-care solutions etc. <br /><br />Of course it depends on the substance you want to use, some may smell too much if someone opens the bottle for a smell-check. Besides you may have to know about the solubility of your substance...<br /><br />This method worked out fine for some people i know, but in the most cases it was about pharmaceutical drugs. At least it should also work for amphetamine, meth, heroine etc. The only problem can be, that it won&#039;t be that easy to recover the substances to their original state (solution to powder, if it was amphetamine powder before). But if it doesn&#039;t matter for you to consume your substances in liquid form, why not trying it this safe way?<br /><br />If you dropped in 1g of Amphetamine in a 50ml &#039;carrier&#039;, you can easily calculate your doses and prepare them by using a syringe or a measuring cup.<br /><br />But: This method may not prevent getting busted when drug dogs are around...

				Under yer ballsack, or if yer a girl ya got an even better spot. Nobody&#039;s gonna search ya there, choose a patdown at the airport rather than an x-ray . Adjust as needed in the airplane bathroom if needed. <br />Easy beans my brutha

				HAHA dogs? You think smoking weed in a room two days before will attract dogs? Sniffer dogs are useless against small personal amounts, they are only good for detecting big amounts. The amount of festivals and events ive been to with coke, pills and weed all just simply tucked in my boxers all my mates too. Never ever been a problem. You are all overthinking this. Unless your planning on taking a kilo of smack put it in your checked luggage within something and within something else. They simply haven&#039;t the time to check for amounts this small

				TobaccoKingUk, <br /><br />Yup, got pulled at a train station by a drug dog because I was wearing a jacket that hung in a room where I smoked the last of the weed I had three days earlier. And that was the last contact with drugs that I had had. Still got the search docket.<br /><br />

				Diazapam is a Benzodiazapine, it reacts exactly the same way in the brain as alcohol does, that&#039;s why alcoholics are prescribed Benzo&#039;s if staying in hospital where they theoretically can&#039;t drink, or if they&#039;re on a certain antibiotic.

				i once traveled from the us to caribbean islands, i brought 20 10mg methadone pills with me in a tylenol bottle that contained pills of very close shape/size... no one took a second look at the contents of the OTC tylenol bottle...<br /><br />RX bottles just open up too many possibilities for questions and inspection by customs in my opinion...<br /><br />but i guess the best method is to not bring antyhing on the plane, mail a package to your destination and dont need to worry about traveling...<br />

				I was wondering something a bit similar, what&#039;s the best way to get a few hits of blotter through US international airport security? I have no problem shoving something up my ass but I feel like if it&#039;s up there too long the heat may destroy the LSD. In the US if you&#039;re leaving the country you need to go through those fully body scanners. I was thinking since you usually wrap blotter in foil, that I could take it and hide it behind my phone battery while it&#039;s turned off, but would that show up on the little x ray thing that they make you put your phone/wallet through?

If so, maybe you could slide them into a book? I cannot imagine they would pop up during x-ray scan that way. They most definitely will I you go by your plan, though. Blotters are paper, basically, dunno what you intent to use as foil and I dunno how yours are currently wrapped, but it irrelevant. <br />You put that in a book (you need to ditch the foil obviously) and X-ray see paper on paper. <br />Electronical equipment (laptops+phones) undergo close scrutinity.
