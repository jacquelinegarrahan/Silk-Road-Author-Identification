				hi,<br /><br />i have read over the wiki, but still do not understand some things fully.<br />please allow me some (for you probably stupid) questions because i just<br />want to make sure ....<br />i think (and hope) my questions are harmless enough to be asked openly.<br /><br /><br />first:)<br />first i didnt understand what FE means, but now i understood there is something like ESCROW which i havent completely understood but i understood that most if not all sellers require buyers on their first (and maybe second and third) purchase to<br />FE (finalize early) and that means i have to give them a positive feedbalck AND mainly TO GIVE THE BITCOINS FREE FOR THEM even before they send out the stuff.&nbsp; they state hey have been burnt too often by newbies for not to require this.<br />that means i pay them and give THEM every freedom to betray me (to send nothing).<br /><br />i mean it doesnt help me if silkroad suggests NOT TO DO THIS if all sellers of my country require it on first buy.<br /><br />this is what i consider a major problem.<br /><br />what do you suggest?<br />what are your experiences ?<br /><br /><br /><br />second:)<br />lets say, f.e., i would want to buy some dope.<br />they state somewhere that you shouldn&#039;t give your real adress.<br />that sound nice, but they suggest using &quot;your friends&quot; adress.<br />well, this wouldnt be a friend any longer if i did it that way and something happened.<br /><br />my main problem is that some sellers require a &quot;registrable adreess&quot;, means an adress where registered mail can be sent to.<br />this is almoust imposible unless you own a slave who does whatever you want from him.<br />some sellers request registered mail to be chosen on first buy!<br /><br />i understand the own adress is kind of risky, however, at least in the beginning as a new buyer, i hardly see any other chance<br />than to maybe place another postbox with a fake name in my own house (where 30+ parties live). but registered mail is impossible then.<br />and i simply do not have the time to go and wait some days in an anonymous house where nobody lives and where i placed a postbox. i just do not have this much time (like the credit card fakers do). <br /><br />well, this problem doesnt bother me too much, but it is a minor problem ...<br /><br /><br />i think i leave it here, lets see if i get answers.<br />i hope it works out, because, if quality is good enough, i am much likely to get a regular customer for what i need for my&nbsp; &quot;hobby&quot; .<br /><br /><br />one final short question :<br /><br />i have this link for silkroad : <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/<br />is it ok ?<br />(i have read in the faq here that fake links are floating around,. i hope my link is ok ?)<br /><br />thanks,<br /><br />schnelles<br /><br />

				i got the same problem with FE ... would have bought already some stuff if not<br /><br />and, i also would like to sell some stuff, but that is even worse, due to the bond, which they say you may never get back, even if you meet the goal of 30 transactions, 1.500 USD sold and 6 weeks active ...<br />that for me is even a&nbsp; bigger problem as i only wanted to do some small scale selling of some prescription drugs ...<br /><br />not happy<br />

				O,P&nbsp; mate just search in the box marked SEARCH, and you will find endless infinite questions and answers about F/E. And before you ask, It&#039;s up to&nbsp; you too take the risk of F/E. If you don&#039;t want&nbsp; to F/E then don&#039;t. But please get your self educated. You can&#039;t ask people to hold you&#039;re hand. Many sensible questions will be answered but things you could find with click of button will be frowned upon OK buddy!! Try and devour everything and everything about here especially the etiquette, and you&#039;re travels will be fruitful.

				never FE ! unless u want to lose money. spend some time checking out vendors. there are plenty that let u purchase w/o FE. just make small purchases to get your stats up and you should be all right.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t FE for anyone. Been here about 2 months and have around 17 successful transactions without an FE or Auto or any refunds. There will always be somebody willing to sell you what you are looking for without forcing you to FE or rip you off. What has worked for me so far is doing the research on this board and buyer feedback over on SR concerning the vendor.
