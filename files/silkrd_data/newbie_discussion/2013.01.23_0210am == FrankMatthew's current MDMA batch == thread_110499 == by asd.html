				I&#039;m considering buying a bulk MDMA batch from FM. I just wanted to make sure of the quality of people that have received from him recently before I pull the trigger. I don&#039;t want any of that red / salmon coloured batch.

				Frank&#039;s current MDMA batch is really bomb. I&#039;ve ordered from him and received the off-white, gray crystalline batch. Alot of small chunks of moonrocks and was overweight too! The guy is really reliable and incredible shipping and stealth. But yeah, I&#039;ve also read about how he is an alleged selective scammer that has shipped out another batch that consists of red powders (supposedly crushed up pills) which made some people sick and have tested negative for any MDxx content. However, that was never my experience I&#039;ve had from him. I guess before you pull the trigger, shoot him a PM and maybe work something out like if you dislike the product you get like 40% refund or something...

				Yeah I suppose working out something with him first would be best. There haven`t been any recent reports of the red batch so I would say it`s safe to assume he`s fixed that issue. From what I`ve seen the guy is pretty honest and doesn`t fuck around. I just wanted to confirm that he does have good molly before I pull the trigger. Thanks for letting me know :)

				You could also try Symbiosis, although if your not in the UK you have to finalize early.&nbsp; With that being said though their molly is fire and their shipping is on point with both speed and stealth.&nbsp; I wish I had not ordered recently from a local vendor because I could have spent less and received a lot more.&nbsp; Also, I would not finalize early for anyone marked as a selective scammer at all.&nbsp; That way in case you do not receive your product you can at least go to resolution and work something out.&nbsp; I would also recommend checking out Super Trips (again the FE thing though :S), as well as JesusofRave (JOR) although at the moment JOR is having supply issues.<br /><br />TinyDot

				If frank has a good track record as of late I will more than likely pull the trigger on it. I&#039;m across the pond and I&#039;m aware of LuckyLucianno but his prices are a bit steep for me right now.<br /><br />Thanks for everyone&#039;s advice! :)

Speculation points to that pre-ban mephedrone or mdpv were full of impurites because manufacturers didn&#039;t even know if these new compounds would become popular so to make the operation more cost efficient they little to none purification. Much like how most E-tards prefer taking tablets over clean MDMA crystals, claiming it to have more push rather than being floored and its usually because there are amphetamines and caffeine in them. Or how people prefer speed pills over Adderall pills because there is always a dab of meth in those bad boys. Thus, a &quot;better&quot; buzz or high , doesn&#039;t necessarily its health conscious.

				Lucky&#039;s stuff is pretty good, it isn&#039;t hard to do washes on it&nbsp; yourself. And color isn&#039;t a very good representation of purity. All that rerocked stuff people rave about is really just a tricky way to cut the product. People who say &quot;omg moonrocks!&quot; are basically saying &quot;omg cut drugs!&quot;.

				I&#039;ve never purchased from Frank Matthews but have read mixed reviews...<br /><br />Some say his MDMA&#039;s quality is great... <br /><br />One disturbing review that I read in the MDMA feedback a couple of months ago stated that the user threw up blood after taking..
