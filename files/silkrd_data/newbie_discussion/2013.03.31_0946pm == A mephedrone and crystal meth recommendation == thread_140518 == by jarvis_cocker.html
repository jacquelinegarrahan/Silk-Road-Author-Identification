				Sup newbies. <br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d swing by and point you in the direction of two vendors who have proven themselves time and time again to be perfect. Price, communication, dispatch, stealth and product are all top notch.<br /><br />So for the mephedrone lovers around us:<br /><br />sonicdrone http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f028f01ceb<br /><br />A long time vendor with a great history of reliability and style. sonicdrone&#039;s shipment landed in my door 24 hours after ordering and came in overweight. The product itself was new to me, as it came clumpy/wet/fluffy but once you&#039;ve&nbsp; spread it out and let it dry it&#039;s up there with the best.<br /><br />For those looking at Crystal Meth:<br /><br />crystalmethod http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2ffe77edac<br /><br />The mighty crystalmethod&#039;s rep speaks for itself. Communication and dispatch were ideal.<br /><br />I feel that I need to comment on the crystal itself, because I&#039;m sure there are loads out there who are yet to sample&nbsp; this compound. This was my first time and I purchased 100mg just because I had half a bitcoin sitting around.<br /><br />It came in overweight (150mg). Reading online they say first try a .20mg or something which I did and got nothing. Anyway I then decided to snort the remaining 130mg and it was a good decision. At the time of posting it has been just under 7 hours and I&#039;m still going strong. I don&#039;t know what other methods are like but snorting it is very nice. <br /><br />A few key points on the crystal; if you&#039;re a seasoned mephedrone user, the smoothness of crystal will surprise you. It&#039;s a lot smoother than mephedrone, the burn is a lot less and the drip is no way near as harsh.<br /><br />The rush is amazing and hits within 45 minutes, and from then on it&#039;s a wave of joy and happiness.<br /><br />Anyway there&#039;s my two cents, not that anyone&#039;s gonna read it.<br /><br />Peace and love.<br /><br />
