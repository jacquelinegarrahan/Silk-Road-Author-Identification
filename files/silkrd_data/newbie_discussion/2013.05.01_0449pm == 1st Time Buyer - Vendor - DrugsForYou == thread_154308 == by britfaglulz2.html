				As in the thread title, I am a first time buyer here on the Silk Road. But being a first time buyer here does not make me a fucking newfag lol and I have done plenty of research and read LOTS of info on the forums about potential scams and scam vendors etc.<br /><br />I would recommend ANY new user to READ READ READ before even spending 0.00000001 BTC or YOU WILL get fucking scammed, sorry, but that is the nature of the beast that we are dealing with here.<br /><br />Anyways... After doing my research I decided to buy from DrugsForYou. He/She is a new vendor with a current feedback score of 100 so I thought I would give them a go, what with also being new here myself I thought it would be worth giving them a shot after doing my research. So far the experience has been very pleasing indeed. I placed my order and sent a message regarding shipping, they got straight back to me and told me they would be sending it today (date of message). I now see that the item has been placed IN TRANSIT.<br /><br />Now then, the reason I am taking the time to write this here is because they have put the item in transit, and there has not even been so much as a SNIFF of the dreaded F.E. requests that scammers seem to like to do. I think this reflects really well on DrugsForYou as I have read that a lot of vendors do not mention F.E. in their profile, but then hit you with it after placing your order and tying up your Bitcoins! And to be honest I was actually fully expecting him to message me today and hit me with &quot;F.E. Please!&quot; and I was gonna tell him to FUCK OFF if he did.<br /><br />DON&#039;T EVER F.E. FOR ANY CUNT. SIMPLE.<br /><br />Follow this rule and you will not be scambait and another sad forum thread. At the end of the day, if this place is going to be a success it isn&#039;t just down to the vendors. If folk come on here looking to buy and see loads and loads of scam reports they will just fuck off to a competitor site, so if we all stick to the rules we will not be scammed.<br /><br />I am very happy with the experience so far with this vendor and up to this point I would recommend them. Obviously I still do not have the package but it doesn&#039;t fucking matter because my BTC is safely in escrow. And I am happy to not be getting fucking hassled to F.E. by a potential scam artist. So as soon as the package arrives I will post here to complete this report.<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;ve done something really good for someone by writing this review, as this is the sort of info I would love to see when looking for a vendor that is trustworthy. One thing that has made me sad at this site is the selective scammers that seem to be around, ya know, lull you into a false sense of security and then rob you.<br /><br />FROM WHAT I HAVE READ YOU DO NOT NEED TO F.E. so they can sort out their cash flow, THEY HAVE A CASH ADVANCE FEATURE FOR THIS PURPOSE.<br /><br />***IF YOU WANNA BE HAPPEEEEE DON&#039;T EVER FUCKING F.E!!!!<br /><br />(If anyone has any questions for me regarding my transaction, please go ahead and post!)

				Not havin FE&#039;d is already a good move as a newbie, but some people will still scam you by letting you stay in escrow.. As a newbie, you have no good record, so the staff may be favorable to the vendor... In some cases they offer 50% refunds but if they never sent the product they still effectively scam you, and you leave 5/5 because you think it got caught by customs. <br />That&#039;s why you should always mention if you got a refund in your feedbacks, and look if there&#039;s a lot of &quot;never arrived but 50% refund&quot;. Good scammers selectively scam by offering refunds on never sent stuff.<br />Of course, there are legit people, and some dodgy looking vendors deliver, the forums are also very important in choosing a vendor.<br />7g is a lot for a first time.. Try to buy 1g first, most people don&#039;t scam for small amounts.

You should also check individual vendor review at &#039;Rumour Mill&#039;. Not all vendors approach stealth in the same way and this can be a problem. While all vendors should take packaging extremely seriously, it&#039;s not always the case.<br /><br />PB.

				7g? Of green? That&#039;s fuck all really when you think about it.<br /><br />With regards to sending it Royal Mail, I used to send and receive weed myself using this method all the time and never had a problem, especially as it is a UK&gt;UK transaction there should be no problem.<br /><br />RE: 50% refunds and all that stuff, I have checked out his profile for this very info before buying. Also seeing as he is new, and I have posted him a message with the link to this thread, I should think that he has the intelligence to realise that it will be well in his fucking favour to do business the proper way. I also have a fairly good &quot;gut&quot; feeling for these type of things, and so far my spidey senses are not tingling so all should be OK!<br /><br />And believe me, I will be writing the 100% truth here about what happens with this transaction so watch this space!

				Good advice for bulk buy yes, but 7g will be OK.<br /><br />If you ever did get questioned on it say a friend sent it to you whilst on holiday, or just plain deny it blah blah blah. For small amounts in the UK it will just get confiscated unless you&#039;ve got a constant stream of parcels coming and you&#039;re getting watched.<br /><br />Secondary addresses and drops are harder to come by in the UK because we don&#039;t have mailboxes outside our properties etc and we are a much more built up country with everyone living on top of one another, quite literally!<br /><br />But for peace of mind and a little plausible deniability, just use a fake name, nothing outrageous, just a simple normal name will do then you can claim the package was sent to the wrong address. Weed is getting pretty much tolerated in the UK now anyhoo...

There are a number of threads here discussing various problems that have arisen from doing so.<br /><br />But here&#039;s a tip from a close friend postal worker: Use a previous occupiers name as opposed to a made up name. They may see thousands upon thousands of letters and packages a day but believe me, they aren&#039;t stupid. They see something out of the ordinary and that baby is gone. Particularly if the postage stamps are foreign. <br /><br />But each to their own. Whatever works for you&nbsp; ;)

				I was only referring to the UK, and in particular UK to UK packages, and like I said, nothing outrageous.<br /><br />Very good point you make though about using a previous occupants name, same thing as a made up name really but carries a little more weight with the plausible deniability eh?<br /><br />I just normally use something like Kevin Williams or some shit.<br /><br />On a side note, I remember watching the Australian Border Patrol TV program here in the UK and someone had a package captured with the name &quot;Ivor Biggan&quot; written on it. Fuck me, that made me laugh! The customs guys even said that was the only reason it got stopped, and that it was a ridiculous attempt at that. FYI it was weed in the package.

My friend of many years, works at the sorting office at night. His job includes taking post for a series of postcode areas. Somewhere in the region of 400 odd addresses. Post addresses to a former tenant is very common and doesn&#039;t stand out. But the eagle eyed among them know that they&#039;ve never seen Kevin Williams at that address before. They&#039;ll pull that out for manual sorting. Or at least they can say that when really they just want to be nosey.<br /><br />Stealth packaging is important for sure. But its effectiveness can only be validated if the name and address is absolutely plausible. Not to say that a fake normal name isn&#039;t effective but I&#039;d say given what I know, it does increase the odds of being spotted and potentially lost.<br /><br />Love the Ivor Biggun one. Look out for Mike Hunt, Ben Dover and Phil McCracken&nbsp; :o

				Well guys, today was the day that the package arrived.<br /><br />DrugsForYou is a seriously cool dude. The product was amazing, what more can I say! Smoked the fuckin&#039; crack right in my bed when the Mrs. brought the post up to me after the postie came!<br /><br />Throughout the deal DrugsForYou provided amazing communication and did not mention FE at all! Delivery took a little longer than expected but I think that was due to the British bank holiday that we have just had here. I do not have any complaints at all about this seller.<br /><br />Being a first time buyer on here, this has really boosted my confidence and I must say that it is sellers like this that will either make or break the SR market. No point in scamming cause you can make so much more money by doing proper business, and this guy has shown that and then some!!!<br /><br />I noticed some people gave him 1/5 (2 to be precise) and were complaining about his crack product. Like I said in my feedback, the colour was not quite what I expected, but hey, colour does not a product make! The stuff was FUCKING AMAZING, I absolutely loved it. Them Dutch boys know their shit when it comes to drugs.<br /><br />The stealth was on a good level. Bubble envelope with heat sealed package inside with the wrap inside of that. Top notch. Rock was a bit broken up, but fuck me, what do you expect to happen to it when it goes through those auto sorting machines? :P<br /><br />Anyway, the long and short of it is that this new vendor on Sr deserves respect for various reasons: no pressure, no mention of dreaded FE, excellent comms, top quality product!!! If anyone else is looking for the same product as me I would highly recommend DrugsForYou due to the reasons I have already stated, you can&#039;t say fairer than that!<br /><br />Comms is a big thing when dealing in this fashion, and DrugsForYou always got back to me when I messaged him, and he did so in a no nonsense fashion. For example, yesterday I told him nothing had arrived and he just told me to keep him informed, whereas I&#039;m sure some vendors would probably think I was on the blag....<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is anything more to say, but if anyone has anything they want to ask me about this transaction, please go ahead and ask me.<br /><br />BTW, here is the feedback I left him:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">rating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OMG just got the crack and smoked it the minute I got it. FUCKIN AMAZIN... Whoever the hater was that gave 1/5 was talkin shit. The colour was not what I expected but the product was amazing. The 1/5 people prob went on the colour alone cause they&#039;re newfags. Stealth was OK, delivery in 7 days, but this due to bank holiday weekend in UK. Top stuff, top seller, amazing communication. USE THIS GUY. If he scams, he&#039;s gonna fuck himself cause he can make SOOO much money doin it proper like this. THANKS DFY AAAAAAAAA+++++++++ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e61438bc14<br /><br />I look forward to hearing your replies...

				Don&#039;t use a false name and if you are brand new you may be asked to FE so go with a very trusted vendor and buy something small. Whatever you do don&#039;t go round telling vendors to &quot;fuck off&quot; and you put it there&#039;s no need for that its just rude. ebooks and things like that are a good first few purchases.

				I am new user and this my second account on the forum. The first one I messed up by forgetting my password and the password to my tormail.org account.<br /><br />But again back to the topic. About DrugsForYou. I also placed an order with him. The communication was very nice since we are both dutch citizens. So we communicated in dutch. I placed my order during the time of DOS attacks. And I both my bitcoins at a very high rate. But any way. But I could still find a window to place my order and then the exchange rate went down. We had lovely conversation about stuff and the order and about he&#039;s bad feed back. He assured me that we just people wanting more free drugs. The he did ask me to FE since we had such nice communitection I did and assured me that I would not be disepointed.<br />He sad he mailed to stuff monday and since this is domestic shipping I should have had it a day later. Now it have been to day later.<br />Today I have mail him have yet to receive a reply. I have decided to wait to till to more before taking action. Does any one have any advice about what kind of action a can and should take?<br /><br />BTW I use an other name for my buyers account.<br /><br />&nbsp;

DONT FE no matter what.. Keep your peace of mind and NEVER FE. Even if you feel like the seller is your best friend dont FE. Its his job to sell you on being your buddy. I have no idea who this seller is and I have nothing negative or positive to say about them, all I am saying IS DONT FE EVER!!

				PS. <br />He asked my to FE so that we could build trust. And he also offer delivery for large quantities. So that why I FE&#039;ed.<br />Because I like trust between people. You to have a solid so to guy. I think is better then going all over the place.<br />And the street in my dutch city are just really bad. Much less users so much less trust worthy dealers. In the best there were Moroccans and Turkish guys selling. Now is guys for the Antilles and they are know to be scammers and most of them have now honor. One time they sell you good stuff the next time the scam you. I have not been on the streets for almost 5 years now and thing have changed a lot. The LE really cracked down on the dealers and users. And I lost all my old connections. Every thing went underground I guess.

He has NEVER failed to deliver according to his feedback so the only 2 poor feedbacks he has out of 68 transactions, which is NOT 89% so I don&#039;t know why the site calculates it as such!!!<br /><br />Please only make WELL EDUCATED judgements about others whether they be vendors or buyers or you will cause users to be discriminated against prematurely.

				Yes I did read the feedback and DFY explained it were people out for more free drugs. I read the other feedback and it was good. <br />And I only wish for other what I wish for myself. So I would never try to destroy some on reputation with out really good reason. <br />I did order from him and before I did he did not have any bad feedback. It is just that the product have not arrived yet while it should have because it is domestic and the in the Netherlands should only that two day. That why I find it strange 3 days have past now. He did say something about needing me to FE to refill his stock and to build trust. <br />&nbsp;

				Sorry bro I can&#039;t make a judgement with regards to domestic interception within the Netherlands as I am not familiar with their internal procedures. You would be best making a new thread and try to ask some other Netherlanders of their experiences and knowledge on the matter.<br /><br />If he was reloading his stock this may have delayed your order. You really should have held off on the FE though bro, because as I have said, this can have an adverse effect on all parties involved in the transaction D:

				Oke so still nothing in the mail. And the DrugsForTou. Has still not replied to my message. While he was online. <br />On his vendor page he is talking about pleasing his costumers is his priority. Well I am not pleased at all.<br />Second he says that if the packages does not arrive he will reship. But to know if I received me package. He has to read my message and if he does not. Well do the math.
