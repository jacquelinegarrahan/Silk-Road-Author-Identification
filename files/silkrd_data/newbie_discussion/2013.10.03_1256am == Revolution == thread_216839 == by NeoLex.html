				Im calling for a violent revolution agaisnt our masters lets show them that we are SICK AND TIRED OF THEIR ZIONIST BULLSHIT.Throw bombs into their houses kill the cops hang the lawyers<br /><br />Here is a recipe for a Chemical weapon:<br />arks: Sulfur mustard (2,20-dichloroethyl sulfide; bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide; CAS#<br />505-60-2) was introduced during WWI as a blister agent (vesicant). Although often called ‘‘HD’’<br />(distilled sulfur mustard) today, it also has been known as ‘‘Lost,’’ ‘‘S-Lost,’’ ‘‘Yellow Cross,’’ ‘‘H’’<br />(a cruder form of sulfur mustard), ‘‘HS,’’ and ‘‘Yperite.’’ It is one member of a class of compounds<br />known as mustards that generally bear a heteroatom (Z) separated from a leaving group (L) by two<br />atoms, that is, contain the Z-(CH2)2-L fragment. Sulfur mustard has the structural formula<br />ClCH2CH2SCH2CH2Cl. Nitrogen mustards, where Z¼N, have been considered as anticancer<br />drugs and CWAs but are not now considered as likely chemical warfare or terrorist threats. They<br />are not discussed in this chapter.<br />Physical Properties: Sulfur mustard (mustard gas) is a colorless oil with bp of 2278C, mp of<br />148C, molecular dipole moment 1.78 D (hexane), and molecular mass of 159. It normally is<br />encountered as an impure, pale yellow–brown, odoriferous liquid. The color generally deepens<br />with increasing amounts of impurity. HD has a vapor density of 5.4 relative to air and a vapor<br />pressure of 0.072 mm Hg at 208C. As a liquid, it is slightly denser than water (1.27 g=mL at 208C). It<br />is miscible in typical organic solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, acetone or chloroform) but has a<br />lower solubility in water (0.092 g=100 g at 228C) (Sidell et al., 1998; Somani, 1992).<br />Chemistry: There are several routes to sulfur mustard. The first production of sulfur mustard in<br />reasonable yield is often credited to Meyer (1886). A second route (Levinstein process) produces<br />elemental sulfur as a contaminant in the mustard. The Steinkopf synthesis of sulfur mustard involves<br />S(CH2CH2OH)2. (Steinkopf et al., 1920).<br />The reactions of sulfur mustard are dominated by its heteroatoms. First, divalent sulfur is a good<br />nucleophile and encourages SN reactions (Whitman, 1995a). Sulfur’s location b to a good leaving<br />group (chlorine) leads to neighboring group participation (Eliel and Wilen, 1994) and, hence, to<br />episulfonium ion formation. This internal nucleophilic displacement is favored by entropic factors.<br />The resulting episulfonium ion possesses substantial small-ring strain and is equally prone to ring<br />opening at either ring carbon. Using water as an external nucleophile, repetition eventually affords a<br />diol <br />Protonated Thiodiglycol<br />hemi-mustard<br />⊕<br />⊕ ⊕<br />24 Chemical Warfare Agents: Chemistry, Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutics<br />Structural variations that hinder episulfonium ion formation or sulfur nucleophilicity reduce<br />activity. Thus, S(C(O)CH2Cl)2 is reported to show little vesicant behavior (Sartori, 1939).<br />Mustard is denser than water, not very water soluble, and hydrolyzes rather slowly in cold<br />water. Thus, it can remain a threat for sometime in bodies of water even though it ultimately<br />hydrolyzes to the relatively safe thiodiglycol. Depending on specific conditions, the hydrolysis also<br />can produce 1,4-thioxane (O(CH2CH2)2S), 2-(vinylthio)ethanol (CH2¼CHSCH2CH2OH), and a<br />variety of other compounds, some in quite minor amounts (D’Agostino and Provost, 1985). For<br />example, mustard can react with thiodiglycol to form, depending on concentrations, mono- or<br />disulfonium ions. One example in which the product is hazardous follows (Yang et al., 1992; Munro<br />et al., 1999).<br /><br />If the external nucleophile is attached to a chain, then two consecutive attacks on HD lead to<br />cross-linking of two chains.<br />Nu = nucleophilic<br />center<br />Cross-linked chains<br />S(CH2CH2Cl)2<br />Nu Nu NuCH2CH2SCH2CH2Nu<br />Molecules with more extensive separation between sulfur and leaving groups, such as chlorine<br />(e.g., Cl(CH2)6S(CH2)6Cl), behave like simple aliphatic halides (or sulfides) since three-membered<br />ring (episulfonium ion) formation is no longer possible. One convenient method for verifying the<br />formation of an episulfonium ion intermediate involves isotopic carbon labeling. Since this ion is<br />symmetric, it would ultimately lead to a nearly 1:1 distribution of an appropriately placed label,<br />something not observed in a direct displacement.<br /><br />SR<br /><br /><br /><br />Sulfides, including HD, undergo oxidation at sulfur. Initial oxidation produces a sulfoxide,<br />whereas further oxidation produces a sulfone (below). Oxidants include hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacids,<br />nitric acid, permanganate ion, ozone, dinitrogen tetroxide, and dichromate ion. Oxides of<br />mustard are not as volatile as mustard. This may help to explain why British air raid shelters were<br />sometimes ‘‘painted’’ using the oxidant calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl)2). ‘‘Episulfonium’’ ion<br />formation is less likely in the sulfoxide of HD than in HD itself.<br />Chemistry of Chemical Warfare Agents 25<br /><br />Sulfide Sulfoxide Sulfone<br />Titanium dioxide and iron oxide particles (anatase TiO2 and ferrihydrite) have been explored as<br />‘‘detoxification’’ materials for threat agents including HD and nerve agents (soman and VX).<br />(Kleinhammes et al., 2005; Ohtani et al., 1987). TiO2 was found to be the more rapidly acting<br />against HD and was able to convert HD into nontoxic materials with 99% effectiveness. Kinetic data<br />for reactions involving both oxides and three threat agents at 258C are provided. Analyses focused<br />on the disappearance of threat agents, and identification of products was not provided. The authors<br />claim that these oxides are more reactive than AP-MgO (Stengl et al., 2005; Kopeer et al., 1999).<br />Chloramine B oxidizes HD to its sulfoxide via an intermediate containing an S–N bond<br />(Whitman, 1995b).<br />S N<br />Strong bases (e.g., alkoxide) can dehydrochlorinate mustard and its sulfoxide and sulfone,<br />converting one or both of their 2-chloroethyl fragments to vinyl groups.<br /><br />Didehydrohalogenation of HD is reported to be complete within 1 min at room temperature<br />using CH3OCH2CH2O as the base (Beaudry et al., 1992). This is a ‘‘component’’ of the decontaminating<br />solution known as DS2 (a mixture of diethylene triamine, ethylene glycol monomethyl<br />ether, and sodium hydroxide). Nanosize particles of calcium oxide have been shown to dehydrohalogenate<br />HD (Wagner et al., 2000b).<br />Although anhydrous mustard is not a substantial corrosion threat to most metals, hydrolysis<br />forms hydrochloric acid and does contribute to mustard’s corrosive behavior. An interesting pmr<br />and gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) study of the hydrolysis of HD has been<br />reported (Logan and Sartori, 2003). In this work, it was shown that hydrolysis (D2O at 228C) had<br />a half-life of approximately 7 min, but that in the presence of sodium chloride, the half-life<br />increased to approximately 24 min. These results are consistent with those reported by Bartlett and<br />Swain (1949).<br />Sulfur mustard has been shown to react with nucleic acid components and the N7-guanine<br />adduct studied by several techniques (Rao et al., 2002).
