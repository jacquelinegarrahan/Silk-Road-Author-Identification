				http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2319064/Noah-Crooks-Chilling-911-reveals-13-year-old-boy-admitting-tried-rape-shot-dead-mom-taking-away-video-game.html<br /><br />Article directly mentions &quot;Mother and son had a stormy relationship&quot; and &quot;Mr Crooks added that the mother and son would fight often&quot;.<br /><br />In plain English- woman was being a typical man-hating feminist bitch to her own son, and so the son naturally started to hate her.<br /><br />How&#039;s that misandry working out for you ladies? How&#039;s it feel when you turn an innocent young boy into a rage-filled person because of your constant abuse and hatred towards him?<br /><br />Imagine how badly his mother must have treated him for the young boy to snap and kill his own mother like this. Looks like being a man-hating bitch didn&#039;t work out too well for her.<br /><br />This is a glimpse of the coming hyper-violent society. You women have created entire generations of rage-filled and angry young men, and they are a product of YOUR man-hatred and abuse.<br /><br />Funny how the article blames the boy, who was ONLY 13 fucking years old, but NEVER places any responsibility onto the mother. It&#039;s because in America, women are NEVER held accountable for their own actions. Even if a woman kills her own children, she will probably not face jail time.<br /><br />When the hell are you women going to GROW THE FUCK UP and start taking responsibility for your own actions? You raised your child wrong, it&#039;s YOUR FUCKING FAULT, not the fault of society or video games or whatever.<br /><br />Anyway, this poor boy was just a product of feminism, feminism brainwashed women into hating men, and women are such pathetic cowards, they take out their man-hatred on young defenseless boys. Then when the young boys who have been so badly abused and hated on by women and even their own mothers grows up and does something like this? Of course, it&#039;s NOT the mother&#039;s fault. No, women are saints, it couldn&#039;t possibly be the result of the mother&#039;s feminist man-hatred and abuse towards her son.<br /><br />And notice in the comments section. Women are saying &quot;That boy is evil, that boy is sick&quot;. NOT ONE SINGLE WOMAN criticized the mother or held her accountable.<br /><br />Once the generations of young men who have been abused and hated on their whole lives by women grow up? What kind of society do you think they will create? Here&#039;s a hint. They will offer NO PROTECTION to women. In the near future, society is going to become so hyper-violent that women will be getting raped or beaten in the streets, and NO MEN will come to help them. Not even the police. And you women CREATED this hyper-violent society by hating on the young boys.<br /><br />Have fun living in the hyper violent society, ladies.

				One boy, whose actions may or may not be directly caused by the actions of his mother- Probably not indicative of the entire gender. Dahmer was a serial killer, rapist, child molester, and he ate people. You don&#039;t see anyone saying men must all be like him because he was a man, do you?

				You people are really sick.<br /><br />I am speaking out against the abuse and molestation of young boys, and you people call this &quot;hatred&quot;?<br /><br />I guess then it must be okay for women to abuse and molest their male children. That&#039;s not &quot;hatred&quot;, of course.<br /><br />Either way, continue spewing your misandry, your hatred of men and boys. Eventually, the younger generation of boys will grow up and you will see what society will turn in to.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t going to be a backlash ONLY against women. It will also be against the older generation of men who sold their sons out to feminism.<br /><br />If I were you people, I would start getting very nervous about what is coming.<br /><br />Think about that scene from Clockwork Orange, where they beat up that old guy. That scene is going to replay itself out tens of thousands of times, and actually, ALREADY IS in modern day England. Nowadays, old women in England are getting robbed and even murdered by young men, who steal their pension checks from them.<br /><br />Why should young men have any respect for you women or for you older people? You clearly have no respect for young men because you sold them out to feminism. Your hatred is what bred these young men. Now you are going to suffer the consequences.

				It really pisses me off how the vast majority of women support child abuse, just as long as the child getting abused is male.<br /><br />That bitch probably deserved to get shot by her son.<br /><br />The question no one is asking is:<br /><br />HOW MUCH DID SHE ABUSE HIM AND HATE ON HIM TO CAUSE HIM TO KILL HER?<br /><br />It&#039;s already been established that 99 percent of women are such misandric man hating bitches that they think there&#039;s nothing wrong with abusing male children. So the question we should be asking is not IF she abused him, but HOW MUCH she abused him.

				dude...he fucking killed his mother and tried to rape her....the fact that you &quot;johnrambo&quot; are siding with this 13-year old shows either your lack of intelligence, or that you can relate.&nbsp; it sounds like you just want to vent about how your mother treated you, citing the first article you found on the internet as a basis.&nbsp; It doesnt say anything about abuse whatsoever, rather he shot her because she TOOK AWAY HIS CALL OF DUTY VIDEO GAME (which, honestly, was probably the catalyst)...AND THEN TRIED TO FUCKING RAPE HER DEAD CORPSE.&nbsp; The fact that you started this thread without even reading the article is funny dude. haha it LITERALLY SAYS, and i quote &quot;There was no history of domestic abuse or criminal records associated with any Crooks family members.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				What does any of this have to do with feminism?<br /><br />Although, yeah small children really don&#039;t murder people unless you abused them to the point where you deserved it.<br /><br />But I bet you the article doesn&#039;t mention anything about feminism. If we&#039;re playing that game, I&#039;m gonna start going &quot;OMG, did you hear about the holocaust? Yeah, shit man. Environmentalism has really gone too far.&quot;

				It&#039;s a tragic story but I do not see how the op made the jump to feminism caused it. Dont get me wrong I think ultra feminism is too much but I just dont see it here.I read the full article and it seemed like a very normal loving family, then again one never knows whats happening behind closed doors.&nbsp; I think mental illness in conjunction with anger and Call of Duty caused this tragedy. Sounds like the OP has some serious mommy issues

				Very few people here are standing up for that abused young boy, so I guess that the majority of you evil bastards actually think that child abuse is okay? Just as long as it&#039;s child abuse against boys, not girls of course.

				You&#039;re missing the point. Nobody in this thread, as far as I can tell, is condoning child abuse of any kind. You&#039;re jumping the gun a bit - in general.<br /><br />I think the reason you&#039;re in the firing line here is that you&#039;ve made this whole thing about gender. There are just as many asshole fathers as there are incompetent mothers. Its a sad story, thats for sure. But has absolutely nothing to do with the gender of the parent. Its a shame you made the point in such a vile, hateful manner - because what you were actually trying to say has now been totally lost. <br /><br />Contrary to what you believe, women are not all conspiring to collectively abuse you, or other men. True story.

				Whooooh&nbsp; what a rant from Rambo, I love my mum, my wife, daughters and radical feminists as well, they provide good entertainment but rambo certainly draws a long bow to blame them. I will be the first to blame the violence that exists in todays families on television then Hollywood and now video games. through in a little bit of racism and we will all be getting murdered soon so why worry anyway. A day at a time to eventually die so live with it Rambo, you ain&#039;t going to achieve a damn thing with the way you rant your head off.<br /><br />I second asking the mods to change the title to whatever whats his name said?&nbsp; &quot; trainsTrainsTRAINS<br />« on: May 04, 2013, 09:21 pm »&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
