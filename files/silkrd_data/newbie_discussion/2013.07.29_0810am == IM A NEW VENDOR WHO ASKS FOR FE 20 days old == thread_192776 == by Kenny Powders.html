				just want to throw it out there <br /><br /><br />this is what the last customer wrote in my feed back <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my doubts about this asshole, I&#039;ve seen him in the forums talking stupid shit but this dude is the real deal. 6 days to my country.<br /><br />Stealth: 5/5<br />Communication: 10/5<br />Product: 10/5<br />Overall: Let&#039;s just say i&#039;m not going back to my old guy!&nbsp; &nbsp; so i sent him $1600 because the first person to buy from them FE $1000 so you can trust that.&nbsp; no one would FE if they did not trust them right <br />i was thinking it was fake but after talking to the man he assured me my money is safe<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e3efe5270b<br /><br /><br />

				InfiniteSource/coachella420/DealerOfDrugs/ScammerHoundDog/russianundergroundrap - look, this is not the way to &quot;report&quot; vendors with whom you have an issue.&nbsp; Report scams the normal way and admin will look into the vendor.&nbsp; Creating fake accounts to pretend like you&#039;re these vendors is just increasing their sales and making you look more and more psychotic.
