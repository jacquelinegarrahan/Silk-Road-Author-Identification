				Post by: <strong>chaosmix</strong> on <strong>January 29, 2013, 04:26 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				From reading about cd prevention techniques on the forums. I have developed a hopefully helpful method of destroying evidence in case they come a knockin. I went online and bought reinforced door frames and heavy duty deadbolts to attach to my already existing oak door. hurricane window film so they cant break in that way for awhile. I already have a six foot fence in the backyard along with my dogs,a pit and a rottie mix to act as an early warning system. My next step is to add security cameras w motion detection to alert me when someone even steps in the yard or drives in front of the house. My plan is in the off chance a cd is attempted at my house i plan to immediately lock the reinforced door,go to the camera room and watch for movement. if shit is about to go down i plan to use the extra time provided by the door and window protection to flush everything down the toilet and replace the contents of the package with something i will already have packaged. usually i get small boxes and envelopes.nothing big. i was thinking a porn dvd in the envelope and a clean mini bubbler in the other one.(for laughs) even though i will probably get charged w the bubbler. my house is always clean except for when i am out making sales and i never order until i run out. i figure flushing is better than immediately writing Return to Sender on it. <br /><br />Does anybody think my idea is right or should i just keep my house clean and not even open the package and just say i didnt know wtf it was and that i was about to go out to eat and open it after i return.

				If they&#039;re doing a CD, they already know the contents of your package. I think I&#039;m missing the point of the dummy packages too, unless you can somehow know in advance exactly what your package is going to look like (return address, shipping label placement, etc).<br /><br />Honestly, your best bet is to refuse to sign for the package and cease shipping to that address.

				Like trotsky said... they already know what the package had in it and took most of it out for evidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Replacing the now dummy drugs with something else, would show that you had prior knowledge to what the package was... thus reinforcing LE&#039;s case.<br /><br />Why not just get to know the post man?... what he/she looks like.&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone other than your post man (postal inspector) attempts to deliver,&nbsp; you know somethings up.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re like by me, where it seems to be different postal workers all the time.

Not taking delivery and refusing to sign can leave LE with fuck all, it&#039;s no guarantee of course but I&#039;d say it greatly reduces your chances of getting busted. You would want to make sure your house is squeaky clean too just in case they do decide to come in for a look.

				So pretty much, if it&#039;s a CD, you&#039;re fucked?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading that people with no prior shit usually don&#039;t get CD&#039;s. However, I&#039;ve also read that people WITHOUT prior shit can get CD&#039;s as well.<br /><br />I have no idea what to expect anymore
