				&nbsp;:) Bienvenidos&nbsp; :)Seeing as how I can&#039;t get in touch with the right person to explain how my account predates the vendors bond, I&nbsp; am stuck here in&nbsp; the newbie section. I might as well keep the official Amish review section here in Newbieland. At least until it gets over spammed by other looking to leave this section.<br /><br />If you have a questions about Amish Mafia ask away.&nbsp; For those who don&#039;t know, Amish Mafia is the hottest and best reviewed oxycodone seller on Silk Road&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9f6d33feef

				We took down some of the smaller listing last week and we put most of those back up.&nbsp; The reason behind it is since we purchase these things prepacked, it takes as much time processing a 100ct order as it does a 1000ct order

				Hi,<br /><br />Newbie member here with a couple of questions for Amish Mafia:<br /><br />1) I see all your percocet is 5mg/325 strength.&nbsp; Are you unable to obtain 10mg/325 strength?<br /><br />2) Why should I not be concerned that even though you SHIP from places like Korea, Singapore, etc., that the drugs themselves didn&#039;t originate from a Chinese counterfeit operation?&nbsp; Maybe you can explain a little how U.S. made pharmaceuticals get shipped from Korea, Singapore, etc.?&nbsp; Just want to make sure I know exactly what I will be getting.<br /><br />Thanks and I am seriously thinking of making an order, as soon as I figure out the whole Bitcoin thing and how to fund my SR account.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Yolky

Secondly, If you have been to countries like the ones we ship from you would know these are not countries where anyone would dare import any Chinese, counterfeit, or any type of narcotics in general to. Places like Singapore are democracies but being caught carrying any amount of counterfeit narcotic, even in your pocket through the airport, will get someone canned. Yes canned, beaten with a cane, repeatedly. <br /><br />And if you attempt to import narcotics or counterfeit medications from China to resell and distribute into Singapore, HK, Korea, Macau, Japan there is a death penalty, they follow the laws in these countries. There are no appeals, no waiting on deathrow for 30 years, you are sentenced to death. <br /><br />If you read up on wiki&nbsp; or Google more information on crimes and punishments for these countries you will understand why trafficking narcotics or counterfeit medicines are uncommon in these places. <br /><br />

				Thanks for your replies Amish Mafia!&nbsp; I believe these answers will help other new SR members make their decision on a vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;m still in the &quot;get Bitcoins&quot; phase, but am almost there.&nbsp; I look forward to personally experiencing your outstanding service and attention to detail that I&#039;ve read about in your customer feedback.&nbsp; Cheers!
