				So I recently received a package of 150 x modafinil tablets, which were taking slightly longer than I expected to arrive. When they were delivered I noticed a big green &#039;Opened By Customs&#039; sticker on the back of the package which scared the shit out of me. Then I realised that if they&#039;d found illicits the most likely action would&#039;ve been to just destroy them.<br /><br />So I opened the package and inside was everything I ordered, plus the standard love letter from customs informing me that they&#039;d opened the package, but it was all above board and they hadn&#039;t removed anything. I&#039;ve had these letters on several other occasions when purchasing other (legal) things, but one difference about this instance was the inclusion of a stamp. On both the love letter and the outside of the package was round stamp which said &#039;CUSTOMS SGF 80&#039; which I haven&#039;t been able to find any info on so far.<br /><br />The internal packaging was also intact so it doesn&#039;t appear that they even removed the items from the parcel.<br /><br />This whole thing has got me more confused than anything. I&#039;m not really concerned about LE busting down the door or anything like that, and I don&#039;t believe I should be. Has this happened to any other Aussies? Or can anyone shed some light on this situation?<br /><br />Cheers.

				Not sure on what the tabs are, gathering they would be illegal to import though.&nbsp; From what I remember Shah1 had his packages opened and sent on while they continued to monitor his incoming mail before finally busting down his door three months later.&nbsp; Food for thought.

				Were the pills well hidden in the package? Maybe the pack got opened and they somehow didnt see the pills?

They were in blister packs and filled up the entire package. It didn&#039;t appear as though the wrapping keeping them all together had been tampered with at all though, even if they had been removed from the package.

				I would proceed with caution as Austrailia is notorius for their customs..<br />That being said, it might be a smart idea if you can order SR items to a new address

				you are lucky you got anything at all. I haven&#039;t had one successful o/s package make it yet and I&#039;ve just about given up trying. In fact i was just about to start a topic AU buyers, How many times did you get your o/s package intercepted, or what vendors seem to have a high success rate to AU? coz I&#039;m fucken sick of it.

				CUSTOMS SGF 80 From what I can make out by what you have said , its just the code used for a parcel from Singapore that was accidently opened/damaged in transit and the Postal services are letting you know that something might have fallen out , lost in transit . Dont think you have much to worry about Hopefully
