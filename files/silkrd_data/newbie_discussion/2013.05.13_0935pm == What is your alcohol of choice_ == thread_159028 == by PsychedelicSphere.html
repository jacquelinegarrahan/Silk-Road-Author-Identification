				I know alcohol is the worst drug I do to date, thankfully I am now tobacco free.<br /><br />So my question is, what&#039;s your poison?<br /><br />I am a big beer drinker, but I mostly stick to budlight and budweiser because it&#039;s cheap. ($20 for 20 16oz cans at the corner store)<br /><br />Liquor wise, I love whiskey. Crown Royal and Jack Daniels are my favorite. I always mix with coke, sometimes sprite if I don&#039;t have coke. <br /><br />Recently a lot of my friends have been getting in a moonshine orders (yes I live in the south) and honestly, I love shooting moonshine. A few friends have made different drinks with the moonshine, but my favorite being Apple Pie moonshine. Damn is it good. <br /><br />Anyways, what about you guys and gals?

				I love trying out new beers, especially visiting micro breweries. It is incredible how many different beer flavors there are... every micro brewery is different, its not often that I find a flavor that is identical to another. I chalk it up to differences in local water supplies. Recently I&#039;ve been finding places that also have stills. I&#039;ve had some really awesome rums and vodkas.<br /><br />Honestly though, I don&#039;t have a particular choice or taste... it depends entirely on what I&#039;m doing. I love whisky with a good cigar as much as a screwdriver and a few lines.&nbsp; ::) I suppose if I were to pick what I drink most often, its beer, second going to Vodka.

				If we&#039;re talking cocktails I like Long Island Iced Tea too &amp; the taste of tequila sunrise but tequila makes me feel sick so I don&#039;t drink it much lol. I can&#039;t remember the other one I had on holiday that was my favourite.

				There are also a lot of bars around here that have their own drinks that are pretty good.<br /><br />Usually some crazy concoction of a lot of different rums and things. Usually pretty good with a high alcohol content.

				Mine is real ale. Just like all the different varieties. Second to that is lager, then pretty much anything with alcohol in it. <br /><br />Saying that I tried to had a dry month in April (only drunk on my anniversary and to celebrate finishing my Research Project at uni)<br /><br />Tried this month but only drank on three or four nights. <br /><br />It is a pretty lame drug on the grand scale of things

				Well<br /><br />It will have to be single malt whiskey - Speyside - Lagavullin etc.<br /><br />They have to be served room temperature and of course neat - if you want to enhance the taste a bit, let the flavors out, drop one or two droplets of water in, not more<br />and you get much more rich taste.<br /><br />Someone here mentioned whiskey with coke - I do love that, I keep my whiskey neat though and snort the coke ;-)<br /><br />

If I see a bottle in a liquor store here in the US that I haven&#039;t tried I usually give it a shot... but I have always been soured by the bars that sell the &quot;american&quot; crap that just isn&#039;t all that great. Plus, they don&#039;t serve it right... so its just never gone well.<br /><br />Most people don&#039;t understand that most spirits actually have unique flavors like wine. There are tons of whiskys and scotch that all have very different flavors. I enjoy going to tastings. Most recently I have been doing Vodka tastings, and I will be honest that I didn&#039;t really consider a lot towards Vodka being all that different from bottle to bottle - the cheap stuff tasted cheap, the good stuff was usually a little more expensive but it was smoother, but it was always Vodka. Wow was I wrong. Ever since the first tasting I went to, I refuse to drink Goose or Belvedere. I enjoy screwdrivers quite a bit, and if I&#039;m getting it that way I tend to just go for whatever is in the well since the OJ does a good job of handling the rest. But, if I&#039;m going on the rocks/martini, I tend to go for a good Stoli or Russian Standard now, if the bar doesn&#039;t have a premium Potatoe. I&#039;m interested to see if I discover some of the same things on Gin - I have been drinking almost exclusively Beefeater for many years... I&#039;m waiting to discover if its as different as the others.

				I&#039;m a big fan of cocktails. <br />My favorite is a...<br /><br />Last Word: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Equal parts: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gin (London dry is the best, IMO. Something simple and with lots of juniper.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chartreuse (green)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maraschino liqueur<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lemon juice (the traditional, Prohibition recipe called for lime. I prefer lemon.) <br />Shake.<br />If you feel like garnishing, a lemon twist goes nicely. <br />&nbsp;
