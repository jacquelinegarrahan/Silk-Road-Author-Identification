				Cocaine purity on the streets is often very very poor. I&#039;ve seen samples (tested by a reputable lab) of less than 25% purity. That&#039;s terrible!

				If you are not from USA i can offer you good prices! But maybe first try 1 gram? It is $75,- but if you want 5 grams i can offer you $69,- and if you want 10 grams can sell it for $65,- per gram. Just look for DQD @ SR.<br />Stay cool 8) DQD

				I pay 100 euro for a gram of ok coke. Cocaine is expensive as fuck, in some countries have it cheaper than others.<br /><br />It&#039;s probably down to quality though, but I&#039;m skeptical of the quality of coke on the SR since the &quot;84% pure MDMA&quot; I bought turned out to be about ~20% pure.

				As you move away from major cities and the coast, the cut becomes unbearable.&nbsp; You really need to know a direct connection, which isn&#039;t what people that use SR want.&nbsp; Even if you can find it in town, I&#039;d rather deal with 0 people in real life and pay 20 bucks more.&nbsp; I never fear that someone 1500 miles away will result in me getting busted for my monthly 100 drug purchase.&nbsp; If you truly use it for recreation, then it is a non issue.

				Yeah, it&#039;s kind of crazy. But it&#039;s worth the convenience. It better to receive in your mailbox. Than to risk getting busted carrying in your car. For me, I can&#039;t find it on the streets. So I&#039;m stuck paying a higher price.<br />But, you can get it cheap if you buy from a new vendor. I&#039;ve had pretty good success with trying new vendors.

				Well i can safely say that none of you blokes is from Australia,you guys dont know what expensive is.SR is by far the cheapest place for us aussies to buy anything.How would you ppl go paying $350-$500 for a gram of coke,that if your lucky is 30-40% pure.Or you can go buy a gram of meth for between $600-$800 and again sum are lucky if it&#039;s actual meth and not sum cheap arse $1 a kilo synthetic shit.<br />Be thankful for what we have here,being a single dad looking after a 3 yr old girl is hard enough,but fuck me if i&#039;m going to take her to sum scumbags house to try and score 1gram of meth for the ridiculous above mentioned price.<br />Every aussie would give their left testy to know about or buy from here.The only thing that is overpriced on here is weed,even then when you think about the logistics of getting your measly 8 ball delivered to your front door,it&#039;s really quite cheap.<br />So until you&#039;re paying what we do ,dont have a sook an a whinge about prices.Do your little brains tell you that you have to buy your gear from SR?

				Pricing low could be seen as admitting you have low quality and some of the vendors have high enough quality to justify the price. Do your research and it can be worth your time.

				almost everything on SR is way more expensive than what you would pay normally.&nbsp; where I am, coke is 60 a gram, cheaper if you buy a ball or more.&nbsp; but with SR you are paying more to have it delivered and to avoid any actual interaction with dealers and shit.&nbsp; it&#039;s up to you whether or not it is worth it.&nbsp;
