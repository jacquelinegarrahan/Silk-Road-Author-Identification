				I tried to buy some Adderall from Coachella420 today. They were ridiculously cheap; cheaper then anyone that I&#039;ve seen on the road for a long time. That made me suspicious, but I decided to give him a shot since I couldn&#039;t find anything negative about him on the forum.<br /><br />He sent me a PM within an hour or so saying that he had been scammed by someone in my &quot;area code&quot; (his exact words - he didn&#039;t say zip code) and that he&#039;d lost a lot of money. Because of that, he told me I would need to FE. I wrote back and said I never FE and copied my stats in that message, even though I knew he could see them without me doing that. I just wanted to make a point.<br /><br />Within 5 minutes of that, he canceled my order. Below is a copy of the emails (with my name removed):<br /><br />&quot;coachella420(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey,<br />I was looking back, and I noticed a known scammer lives in the same area code as you. I lost alot of money to this guy. I&#039;m not claiming your him, however, i&#039;m going to have to ask your to FE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete&quot; <br /><br />Me: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi - I&#039;m sorry, there&#039;s no way I&#039;m finalizing early. If you look at my stats, they make abundantly clear that I&#039;m not a scammer.<br />I know that you&#039;re able to view them without me doing this, but here they are:<br />Total transactions: 58<br />Total spent: à¸¿3107.8<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 year<br />If you don&#039;t want to sell to me than cancel my order. I&#039;m not accusing you of anything, but the fact that this item is ridiculously cheap makes your listing seem suspicious.<br />PS There are over 9 million people in my state and at least 2 million in my &#039;area code&#039; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete&quot;<br /><br />&quot;coachella420(100) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Do not reply &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear [so and so],<br />We are sorry to inform you that coachella420 has canceled your order of (1) 5x 30mg IR adderalls. Quit slacking! SHIPS TODAY. Your payment has been returned to your account and we hope that you can find a suitable replacement from another seller.<br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road staff<br />NOTE: This is an automated message. Replies will not be answered &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete&quot;<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not angry about this at all. I&#039;m just trying to warn others to stay away from him.

It&#039;s clear (or should be to anyone with half a brain) that he was attempting to pull a scam. I took me all of about 2 minutes at most to post that. It wasn&#039;t exactly a ton of work.<br /><br />As I said in my post: &quot;Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not angry about this at all. I&#039;m just trying to warn others to stay away from him.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that he really remembered someone in my &quot;area code&quot; scammed him LOL. Please.<br /><br />Not to mention they were dirt cheap.<br /><br />Oh, and there&#039;s the fact that an hour after I posted this, this MYSTERIOUSLY appeared on his vendor page:<br /><br />&quot;Edit:4/26 uh oh! looks like my competition left a few dirty reviews.<br />This user has no active listings<br />rating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is a FUCKING SCAMMER!!! Do NOT PURCHASE FROM HIM and DO NOT FE! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item&quot;<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e590757123<br /><br />Gee, hard to imagine. It&#039;s funny, there were 6-7 Adderall listings that vanished into thin air within an hour of me posting this. And no, that wasn&#039;t me; you don&#039;t get to leave feedback in my case. Otherwise I would have just left negative feedback and would not have bothered with this.<br /><br />Anyone who looks at my buying stats and thinks I&#039;m a scammer is an idiot.<br /><br />And you sir are a fucking moron.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny, for such a &quot;stand-up dude,&quot; there&#039;s a dearth of reviews for him in the forums.<br /><br />You don&#039;t even say that he IS a &quot;stand-up dude&quot; or even that you&#039;ve successfully made a purchase from him. You say, &quot;c420 has always seemed to be a stand up dude.&quot; LMFAO<br /><br />Pray tell, how does he &quot;seem&quot; like anything to you?<br /><br />&quot;and it&#039;s not like he marked it in transit and then disappeared or anything.&quot;<br />Right. Because I refused to FE jackass. Otherwise that&#039;s exactly how it would have gone down.<br /><br />&quot;if you exert that much effort after losing nothing, well, seems shady on your end.&quot;<br />This isn&#039;t for me. This is for other potential buyers. I appreciate it when others do the same. That&#039;s why the forums exist.<br /><br />You either are cochella420 or you&#039;re fucking him. Which is it dickface?<br /><br />Moron.

				This all seems perfectly reasonable. The guy was nice, courteous, nonjudgmental. Wish cops were more like that. I doubt you&#039;d even have trouble ordering from him in the future if you decided to change your mind about FE or the situation has been dealt with. Dunno his stats, it&#039;s definitely hard to tell these days as the rating system is totally fucked up with several sellers demanding &quot;5/5 no matter what or you&#039;ll be blacklisted.&quot; But from what he gave you, it seems perfectly normal.

Just protecting his own interests and figured better for you both not to proceed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look, I don&#039;t live in a small, remote area. The majority of his feedback only says FE. On top of that, someone clearly did get scammed and left negative feedback after I had ordered. He is a scammer; he took down 6-7 listings after receiving ONE negative feedback. Come on.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t care at all. You&#039;re both right that I lost nothing (although I can&#039;t remember if the item was hedged or not - so it is possible that I lost something over the course of half a day that it took for this to transpire).<br /><br />I&#039;m just here to warn others. That&#039;s what this forum is for. Everyone is free to make up their own minds and to buy from whomever they choose. This is just a warning to others. I appreciate it when others do the same. I figured for karma&#039;s (as in IRL --- not forum karma) sake, it would be good for me to do this.<br /><br />For the record, I never called him a scammer in the body of my post once. I referred to this as a &quot;scam report&quot; in the title. Perhaps I should have been more clear and said potential scam report.<br /><br />I&#039;m not claiming that he actually scammed me, just that he was attempting to and that he wasted my time and caused a delay in me actually receiving the items I want to buy. That&#039;s it.

I simply stated that I was not going to FE, I pointed out my buying stats, and also pointed out that anyone selling 30 mg Adderall for less than $15 a piece was questionable to begin with (to which I added that I wasn&#039;t accusing him of anything). I reported him to SR and then came here to warn others. Only once in this thread was I impolite and that was only because I don&#039;t appreciate being referred to as shady.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but we&#039;re talking about someone who had less than 50 transactions.<br /><br />And my stats are perfect. That&#039;s why it&#039;s not &quot;normal&quot; or reasonable. I&#039;ve never been asked to FE by anyone and I&#039;m not the only resident of my state.<br /><br />There was no reason to ask me to go out of escrow unless he planned on ripping me off. The shipping was supposed to have a DCN, so he would have had proof of delivery if it had gone into resolution. Since I&#039;ve never had a refund and have never auto-finalized, he wasn&#039;t likely to get ripped off.<br /><br />I&#039;m not stopping anyone from buying from him (i.e. if he ever has a listing again). LOL<br /><br />I got lucky by having my order cancelled. I want to make sure no one gets taken by someone so clearly dim-witted.

They disappear as fast as they appear. There&#039;s very little information on them in the forums. <br /><br />That&#039;s why it mattered. But I am glad to hear his page is down.

				Guys, I learned a *lot* from this thread.<br /><br />Am wondering if anyone could take a look at a post of mine, about how to gain trust from buyers, as a brand-new vendor. I&#039;m worried no one will trust me, since they&#039;ll see, initially, zero sales! But I&#039;m going to offer a wonderful product and great service, and I&#039;m honest. Can anyone weigh in on my post?<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151646.0<br />

				i learned a lot from this thread too-- thanks guys. i hope everyone who is new reads this thread, i will NEVER FE for anyone now (not that i have anyway, but i have *offered* to for one person as i read in the forums about their partner being arrested and i knew that they needed $$ ASAP. in any case they declined, which just shows that they were honest to begin with), no matter how trustworthy they are or how many good reviews they have. escrow is the only thing buyers have to protect themselves from scams-- forgoing that is just stupid.

				Well guys, I just got his shipment in the mail. The packaging was amazing, some of the best I&#039;ve seen, and the product looks the same as any adderall I&#039;ve seen before. So I&#039;m pretty damn sure it&#039;s legit. Thanks coachella420. Can&#039;t finalize right now cause the site is down, but I will once it&#039;s back up.

And this was the first time that a vendor ever attempted to scam me, I&#039;m usually pretty cautious.<br /><br />I searched the entire forum before I placed my order, but I did not see anything about him scamming anyone. There was something calling him an idiot, but it wasn&#039;t a thread about his products. With things like Adderall, it&#039;s nearly impossible to tell if someone&#039;s a scammer. They don&#039;t have nearly as many customers as, say, a weed vendor would, and pill vendors crop up and disappear fast for reasons that heave nothing to do with scamming.<br /><br />I had a feeling that he might have been a scammer when I ordered, but there weren&#039;t a lot of other options to choose from that day and I went with him only because he had the most transactions of the vendors I had to select from and had a 100 rating (yeah I know that doesn&#039;t mean shit). I also knew that I had more successful transactions than him and a better reputation than him, so I figured if it didn&#039;t work out, I&#039;d at least get a partial refund in resolution. But when he asked me to FE, I knew it was bullshit.<br /><br />The only reason I came to Winslow&#039;s defense is because he stated in his initial post that he placed the order before reading my thread, so he had the same information to go on as I did. I doubt if he intentionally picked a scammer to buy from and I don&#039;t know that c420 got paid at all (actually I know for a fact he hasn&#039;t because the site has been down since he received the order and he said he refused to FE -- and I know becuase I&#039;m actually upset myself because there&#039;s a good vendor who I really would like to pay, but can&#039;t as of right now).<br /><br />And when I said honesty was important, I was referring to the forum ONLY. If you mean to say that this person should go into resolution instead of finalizing, then I completely agree with you. I think SR should get their cut of the sale, but the buyer should go into resolution if there&#039;s any chance c420 could actually get paid for the transaction.<br /><br />But with that said, I&#039;ve always assumed that if a vendor with pending sales gets his account banned, he would be unable to get paid for any pending transactions. That&#039;s what should happen. SR should lock their accounts and confiscate the funds IMHO.<br /><br />I agree 100% that no one should be handing over money to c420 that he can use to open another vendor account.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t think anyone is obligated to donate funds to scam victims. Number one, it&#039;s impossible to verify that they are actually victims. And two, if ever there were a place where the expression buyer beware applied, it&#039;s definitely SR. Everyone knows the risk up front and everyone is responsible for doing their own homework.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m not sure how we are ever going to defeat evil scum around here, if we aren&#039;t willing to take a stand and fight back.&quot;<br />-----That quote is more than anything what prompted me to reply to your post. The only way we can do that is to encourage honesty in the forums, to report honestly on all of our dealings with vendors (good and bad - which I will be doing from now on now that I&#039;ve finally reached 50 posts), and reporting every shady dealing to SR staff. Coachella was the first vendor who I ever had to report. I&#039;ve been very fortunate in my dealings here, but I&#039;m also super cautious and take very few risks.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I said honesty is important. I meant here and only here. And no, C420 should in no way get paid for Winslow&#039;s (or any other transactions after his account was banned). In that case, it would be OK to lie I guess, but I&#039;d like to know what actually happens with open orders when a vendor is banned. It might not be necessary to lie.<br /><br />None of us have any way of knowing whether Winslow&#039;s transaction really took place. He could be c420 himself for all we know. I doubt it since it doesn&#039;t matter now, but anything that anyone chooses to believe on these forums is accepted on faith. There are no facts here. And Winslow, if you&#039;re reading this, I&#039;m not accusing you of anything and I&#039;m not trying to imply anything. This could apply to anyone on this thread including myself.<br /><br />So yeah, I lie my fucking ass off just about every day of my life and I have no problem admitting that. I try to keep my reports of my dealings with SR vendors 100% honest in the forum though, since this is basically a web of trust. I&#039;m every bit as interested in getting rid of all the scumbag vendors on the road as anyone else is.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I_hate_scammers: Fucking right man! I can say from experience he does in fact get the rest of his money if people finalize on it. I never scammed anyone in my life, but shit happens. It doesn&#039;t always happen to the right people at the right time, but it happens.

				Yeah, that&#039;s one of the differences. We could also mention how I took a stand against scammers long before SR Support did... that certainly makes me different too. Actually, it makes me very similar to a lot of people here on SR, especially how the majority of those who witnessed coachella&#039;s behavior long before this happened supported my concerns. I would say as a whole this is a great community and I&#039;m proud to be a part of it. The scammers are out numbered, that&#039;s a fact.

				I have an order with Coachella420 that is still in escrow, 11 days to &quot;Auto Finalize&quot; actually. I&#039;m assuming I will get a refund, hoping that is. <br /><br />Went 8 months and 65 orders on SR with a perfect history, and all of the sudden I get scammed back to back on two different orders, out 500 bones as of now.
