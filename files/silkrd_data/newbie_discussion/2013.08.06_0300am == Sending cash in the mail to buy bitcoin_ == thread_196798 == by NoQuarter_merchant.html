				I&#039;m just curious...<br /><br />Would anyone consider mailing cash to buy bitcoin?<br /><br />It seems NUTS.<br /><br />But when you think about it... thousands and thousands of people deposited money with bitfloor using local til, and that money was a one way street.<br /><br />Really, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a truly 100% anonymous way to buy bitcoin.&nbsp; Even with bitfloor or making deposits into someones bank account, you&#039;re on camera making a deposit.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on cash in the mail?&nbsp; Stupid?&nbsp; Unsafe?&nbsp; The most anonymous way to go?

				Honestly is very RISKY... I was going through JMB for a while then his listings went down, so I went through another vendor (Benzo King) on Friday... I checked his page because it was taking longer than it should have. I found out that SR revoked his vendor account due to scamming... Had I actually read up on him before I sent his $400 I would still have my money... Just make sure you do solid research on a vendor before making that type of deal...

				Don&#039;t do it, period. Learned my lesson as I also got taken by BenzoKing, for $500. Giving someone your money with no way to dispute a bad transaction or get any protection at all is not smart. Learn from those of us who made a costly mistake. Don&#039;t ever enter into a transaction where you don&#039;t have protection; Don&#039;t FE ever, don&#039;t send someone your hard earned money with only a promise that you&#039;ll get something in return. Don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />As the saying goes, &quot;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot; Pretend you&#039;re one of us who got ripped off and keep the shame where it belongs.

				I did a &quot;Buy BTC with Vanilla reload card&quot; transaction. Gave him the $, never got the coin. No way to do anything about it. I don&#039;t know what anyone else did but the asswipe was also advertising BTC for Western Union and other reload cards too. I know of a number of people who sent $ by WU and sent reload card info and got nada also.

				I believe that what you said is fact. I would never send anyone WU, I just found another way to be just as stupid though. Just the once, Never Again!

				There&#039;s another thread in the forum for help on buying BTC&#039;s using different methods... It&#039;s definitely worth checking out... I&#039;ve used JMB a couple of times before so I&#039;d recommend him, but just keep in mind you&#039;re still making yourself vulnerable to scamming... Read feedback and forum discussions about a vendor when considering any transactions.

Box in the future to receive cash ....but look me up and check my reviews out... im on localbitcoins.com also under DevilDawg (USMC)

				Yes, mailing cash is never a smart idea when you&#039;re considering protecting your purchase.<br /><br />I purchased bitcoin from bitfloor all the time, and I had to deposit money into a savings account!&nbsp; What&#039;s the difference?&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of us have purchase BTC through western union, or had to finalize early when dealing with a vendor on here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, there are scammers.&nbsp; As long as the internet is working there will be scammers.<br /><br />I&#039;m talking about a purely anonymous way to buy bitcoin.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see a way to do it.&nbsp; Even when you send western union, you&#039;re on someones video camera some where.&nbsp; There is always a trail, however small, when you&#039;re buying bitcoin.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe if you use local bitcoin, but still, you&#039;re meeting a guy in person?&nbsp; Depositing into his bank account?&nbsp; What if it&#039;s LE?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It seems to me there is no true 100% anonymous way to get bicoin unless you&#039;re mining it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not saying we should stop buying bitcoin, I&#039;m just saying it would be nice to have the option to drop cash some where without anyone knowing who you are and have your bitcoin the next day.

Excellent protection. Plus buying/selling btc in NOT ILLEGAL! Even if you meet in person and the seller/buyer is LE you&#039;re not breaking any law. BTC is being accepted by cafes, bookstores and other brick and mortar businesses so the is zero legal risk in buying or selling btc. Just because you bought some btc doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re going to use it to buy illegal products on a website, SR for example. So no worries mate!
