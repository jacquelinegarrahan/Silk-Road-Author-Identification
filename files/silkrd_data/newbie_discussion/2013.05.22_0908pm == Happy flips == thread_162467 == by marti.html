				Ultra Jedi Flip= drop your L, snort a 50mg line of K, wait for the peak of the L, then another 50mg K, parachute 140mg (pending on your weight, maybe more maybe less, 1.5mg per KG of your weight), 2g+ Mushys then 10-25mg 2cb.. and the option of some GHB for the come down.<br /><br />&nbsp;Personally i leave out the ghb cause by the time im coming down im dead tired as is, and have no trouble passing the fuck out.<br /><br />&nbsp;LSD goes amazingly with any of the above.

				I tried 1000ug 25I-Nbome + 200mg MDMA for the first time the other night. Felt like I may have dropped the MDMA a little too early on into the 25I trip, at +1 hours. The come up for 25I can be quite frantic with that energy rush and the visuals starting to appear, I feel like the MDMA at maybe T +2 or 2.5 would be a better way to do this as you would be coming up just as the 25I settles down.

				adding to the post above me, just as an interesting little tidbit, but my friend once blew about 100 mg&#039;s of some pure mdma before we both dropped 1mg of 25I-NBOMe and he said for the entire trip the initial rolling from the mdma continued at about the same intensity the entire trip. As I did not do any mdma prior I thought that was awesome lol. Have something to do with them both being PEA&#039;s maybe? idk

				i always liked 175-200mg of mdma and then like an hour later eat mushrooms. i find the mdma really levels out the dramatic ups and downs mushrooms can cause sometimes. usually i would drop another 100mg booster of mdma like 3 hours after the first dose. then ketamine when coming down.

				RobLobLaw, that reminds me, one time I also ate an eigth of extremely good mushrooms and then an hour in when I was starting to trip insanely hard, I decided to bomb about 200 mg&#039;s of mdma, and then it COMPLETELY killed my mushroom trip, like visuals and everything mostly. It was nuts, and I was super suprised. Although I could still feel some fucked-upedness from the shrooms, it was more like an ecstacy pill cut with something, cause I felt like I was rolling balls with some extra head fuck added, but definitely not &quot;tripping&quot; anymore, drug combinations are interesting, and the way drugs work in the brain can never be though of as just an addition equation, there are MANY MANY other factors involved, its crazy. For example how some drugs can just cancel each other out and stuff.

				interesting, It is crazy how differently people react to the same drugs too, as I highly enjoy blowing K mixed up real good wit some molly, def not as intense roll but def diff than just straight K, I like to call it KetaMolly heaven, cause my body and brain feel so fucking goddam good all at the same time=p lol, although I would like to do these two while tripping, as I have not done that yet

				corporal charge?? It definitely has more of a body load, but honestly the 25I-NBOMe I just got is fucking pure as hell man. Like snow white crystals. Ask most people and they will tell you NBOMe is tannish off white colored, but this shit I got custom synthed is fucking FIRE. Snow white powder like I&#039;ve never seen before. Anyways LSD is always better ;p But if you wanna cut your trip in half try the NBOMe, it is pretty cool in its own unique way, specificially 25I, as from everyone I talked to that is always the favorite. But again this shit I have literally has like no body load, it reminds me a lot of LSD besides the horrible taste and the nature of the visuals. I actually am waiting for a good day to take 2-3 milligrams of 25I fully complexed because my one friend told me he was getting DMT like visuals off that shit =p<br />

				Oh yeah if anyone happens to have some 2c-p and other psychadelics, I&#039;ve always wondered what a real high dose of some pure 2c-p was like mixed with acid or shrooms. and as in high dose I mean like 30+ milligrams. Lol I have done like 60+ milligrams of 2c-p I got from a polish lab before and It was fucking awesome. Like literally crazy acid trip shit, craziest visuals I have gotten off of any 2c-x chemical. The kicker is I did way more than I&#039;ve ever seen a report for except for an overdose on over 100 milligrams and had virtually no negative side effects whatsoever and I tripped hard as fuck for like 3 days straight. Anyone else have any crazy stories about 2c-P?? lol this is the only 2c-x I consider to be an &quot;archtypal psych&quot; or whatever
