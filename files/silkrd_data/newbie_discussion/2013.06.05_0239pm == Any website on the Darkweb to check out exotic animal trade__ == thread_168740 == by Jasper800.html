				I wouldn&#039;t ever support this time of thing. I think it&#039;s absolutely awful... I am just curious if anyone knows of a website where people are selling these animals? It would be interesting to take a look, to say the least.

				I don&#039;t find drug use to be as sinister as exotic animal trading. I actually don&#039;t find drug use sinister at all, if the right people are doing it. Some people have more addictive personalities, they should avoid super-addictive drugs... my opinion. As far as animal trade goes... it&#039;s sad sad sad. I saw on the news a guy was busted with 30% of the remaining population of some turtle from Asia. That&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about. Also, people don&#039;t realize what happens when animals within a habitat go extinct; it affects all of us.

				I know a bit about how exotic animals are sold, so here it goes (and the reason it&#039;s likely you won&#039;t find them on the web).<br /><br />The big exotics, like lions, tigers, hyenas (which would be AWESOME to have btw) already are being sold by big institutions, they&#039;re called zoos.<br /><br />This system was set up long ago, before the common use of the internet, and the people who play that game are old school, are unlikely to use the web, and can do so safely (legally) at any rate. The laws to discourage exotic animals have only really been passed on the buyers side. Government will not mess with big business.<br />So this is how it goes. A zoo gets aza certified it has the benefit of appearing like it&#039;s helping conservation, and now it can sell it&#039;s surplus animals to brokers under the guise of a &quot;breeding program&quot; if the animals are endangered. Brokers, in turn, can sell to anyone they please, if the gov comes around asking why endangered species are being sold, the brokers shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;The animal is on permanent loan&quot;. You see in this way, by acting like the animal is part of a breeding program, they become untouchable. Brokers will sell to anyone, they will sell to auctions, to trophy hunters, to pet stores etc.<br />Also a lot of loopholes, for example, selling tigers across states is illegal. OR IS IT? Hybrid tigers have been deemed legal, so now anyone can cross a bengal and siberian and have generations of cubs to sell, on top of that NO ONE is going to genetically test these animals to make sure they are mixed, so purebred tigers can be sold safely now too.<br />Small exotics, say like tortoises, are one of the animals completely unprotected by welfare laws. They can be wild caught, rounded up, 50 percent killed in transport, and that&#039;s all legal.<br />The list goes, reptiles, birds, rats, mice, fish and I think guinea pigs, these are not considered animals under the law.<br />So if one wanted an exotic animal, one should steer clear of the wild caught and try to find auctions, transparent breeders, or better yet a rescue agency, there are tons of tigers, bears, and lions that are &quot;free to good home&quot; now.<br />Of course, should you get an animal like that you must be able to provide for it properly, and I&#039;m not saying settle for the usda&#039;s lowest specifications properly, usda is a joke. You should be able to meet all the psychological and physical needs of the animals, just as you would a dog.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be getting my capybara in a couple of months&nbsp; 8) <br />ps. If you think want an animal my advice is to accrue some hours working with the type of animal you want, by volunteering somewhere etc. In some states this is a requirement for dangerous animals.

				I agree with you, Jasper and Hellrayzor. I don&#039;t find drug use sinister neither. <br />But there are also services and items in SR sold, which are only little or not at all morally acceptable. And by using this platform we simultaneously show tolerance to all those things. So why judge other sites? ;)

				Unfortunately it is the law that drives otherwise legitimate animal breading undergound creating very sad situations.<br /><br />But then again your standard puppy farm is not much better.

So why judge other sites? ;)&quot;<br /><br />Totally agree with this comment above.<br /><br />Shame I was hoping there was a place to look at rare breeds of snakes as thats what interests me.&nbsp; Just because someone deals in a banned species doesn&#039;t mean there going to be cruel and torture animals.<br /><br />Someone who purchases a legal animal has just as much capability of being cruel. In a way you could argue more likely to be cruel as the animal is cheap and easy to source.&nbsp; If you purchased an expensive snake on the black market at a high price and high risk it would then seem a strange plan then to want to torture or kill it.<br /><br />Just like someone who invests in a gram of heroin doesn&#039;t mean its going to destroy their life. However, with it being such a physically addictive compound there is certainly a chance.<br /><br />Let people make their own choices white knights and leave the decisions of whats right and wrong to governments and law makers.<br /><br />Wow to come in here and judge whats right and wrong whilst happily accepting sales of crack and heroin some of the most addictive and destructive compounds known to man.&nbsp; <br /><br />White knightery at its best and most hypocritical. <br /><br />If someone does know of such a place would be very interested to know. based on the amount of new drug sites springing up some of awesome quality I would assume this is just a matter of time.
