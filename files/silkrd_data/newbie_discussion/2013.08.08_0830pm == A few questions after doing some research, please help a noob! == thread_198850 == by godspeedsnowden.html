				I really wish there were some newbie stickies here.<br /><br />Been lurking SR for a while.&nbsp; Contemplated using the site many times, haven&#039;t been on the deep web in a while.&nbsp; Was planning on making a few small transactions this month and obtaining my btc from bitinstant but now I find out they are down.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a place to buy btc? I don&#039;t really want to link bank account or anything because I have student loans and stuff in my bank account.&nbsp; I found a thread with a list of places to buy BTC but there were no reviews.<br /><br />Thinking about using bitstamp, virwox or maybe resorting to coinbase (ugh) but not too familiar with how they work.&nbsp; Local bitcoins not an option.<br /><br />Once I obtain the BTC how should I go about transferring to my silkroad account, should I just have them sent directly there or through a series of other wallets (or whatever they are called)<br /><br />Only using the road for small personal amounts btw.

				As I understand it, SR will automatically tumble(I.E. pass through multiple addresses) your transfer, according to the buyer&#039;s GUide:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just when you thought Silk Road couldn&#039;t be more secure, we went one step further. The tumbler sends all payments through a complex, semi-random series of dummy transactions, each with a new, one-use receiving address, making it nearly impossible to link your payment with any coins leaving the site. The quantity, frequency, and number of transactions are all varied chaotically in a way that mimics the transactions of the Bitcoin economy as a whole. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Where you buy the BTC is really just personal preference, and most of the services have little difference. There is no real danger using a bank account because there is nothing illegal about buying BTC and ideally you cover the trail anyway.&nbsp; If you want to be on the safe side then it is indeed wise to &#039;&#039;tumble&#039;&#039; the BTC through one or several other wallets before sending them to your SR wallet. Also to be safe, use PGP encryption (you can find threads explaining how) when sending info like your address.<br /><br />All in all, be cautious, but do not worry too much. Small amounts for personal use are not generally the target of law enforcement.

				Hey I&#039;m at the same dead end as you just trying to find a safe and easy way to attain coins. I was thinking about using bitinstant as well and paying for it at walmart. How do you know that the site is down though? I can access it now can you just not complete transactions or what?<br />I was more worried about the bad reputation I saw on the company too
