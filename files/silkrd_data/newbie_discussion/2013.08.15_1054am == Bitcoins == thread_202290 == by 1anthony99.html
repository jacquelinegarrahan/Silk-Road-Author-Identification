				I will walk you through it... Follow the link here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f8f2cf120e<br /><br />Buy the free listing and then I will walk you through the transaction. It will require you to deposit the amount you want to change into Bitcoin through Western Union. Once the funds are verified you will have your bitcoin deposited directly in your account.

				In my post I said localbitcoins, perhaps I should have been more clear. That is a website where you buy them off people personally and it has a ratings system based on trust.<br /><br />No offence to any guys selling it on here but be very careful about who you buy from.

				I suppose it would be unethical if I wasn&#039;t doing it with good intentions. I am not charging him fees and I am providing a service. Hopefully he will appreciate it and use me in the future. If he wants to use another method that is his right. I am not trying to pressure anyone or take advantage in any way. I was only offering my service.

				I have always used Bitinstant to get coins in the past. It is not a terribly onerous process, but there are fees involved and it is not 100% anonymous. I am currently offering my service for very cheap and it provides complete anonymity.
