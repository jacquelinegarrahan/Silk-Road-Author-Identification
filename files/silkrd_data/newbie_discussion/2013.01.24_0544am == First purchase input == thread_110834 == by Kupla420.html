				Alright so I&#039;m gonna be getting a good amount of money soon and I want to make me first buy but I wanted some people&#039;s thoughts on what I should do first. I&#039;m wondering how many of you think I can go straight into buying what I want or should I get decoys sent to me first? Before answering I&#039;d like you to read why I think the decoys would be a smart first move and if you agree can you let me know if those decoy packages are actually legit.<br /><br />I think I should do the decoys first because I feel that even before I knew about this site that my packages were searched. Just this past Christmas I got a Amazon gift card with a shit load of money on it, so naturally I went and bought a shit load of stuff in a short amount of time. I got 5 packages all together. 2 were boxes and the other 3 came in the big yellow envelopes. The envelops all arrived last at my home but I thought something was odd. One package I bought was an Orbit and the other 2 were games but one of the game packages seemed off before I opened it. Then I realized it was pretty obvious why it looked different. Typically where it is sealed closed it just looks like a perfectly sealed envelope but when you open it the glue rips the white lining on the inside off and frays it. Well the odd thing about this envelope was the fact that I received it sealed but the white part that frays only after being opened was already there under the glue and the lip to open it just completely ripped off when I tried to open it rather than just flipping up... <br /><br />I don&#039;t see why else it would be like that unless it was opened and resealed closed but I also don&#039;t understand why the hell they&#039;d open up a package that clearly just had a game or a DVD in it. Even an old man would realize it was at least a DVD box so I don&#039;t understand what could have made them suspicious about the package... So if my mail is getting checked for things that shouldn&#039;t even be suspicious at all, what do you all recommend my first move on here be? I feel the decoys would be a good first move but there&#039;s not any reviews on it so I have no idea if it&#039;s just a scam or not. And if it is what do you all suggest I do then?

				Uhhh this isn&#039;t about not knowing how to order drugs because I do know how to order the drugs. This is about ordering them without it getting checked because my orders that weren&#039;t drugs got opened which seems like the drugs I&#039;m going to order would too. No need to be a prick. If you don&#039;t want to give me a useful answer then don&#039;t leave a comment.

				&nbsp;:)&nbsp; Kupla420,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I would be a bit wary too since you noticed something odd about your mail. Can you not get a mail service PO box, like at a United Parcel Service <br />service store or the equivalent? Or have it sent to a family/trusted friend using a different name and writing in &quot;C/O&quot;, (in care of), visitors staying for awhile do that. just a couple ideas. Diane

				I think you should do what makes you feel the most comfortable but personally I don&#039;t think you need to go the dummy mail route. I have been receiving clandestine packages via USPS since long before SR and have never had a problem.&nbsp; However, that said I will say this that some of the sellers do not do anything to hide the contents of the packaging so if the outer packaging is opened it&#039;s pretty obvious what it contains. Better packaging makes the inner product invisible to the eye if the outer packaging is opened and that does happen occasionally.
