				Hey guys,<br /><br />I was wondering if you guys could help me figure out if I got scammed yesterday. I initiated a bitcoin transfer for cash with a seemingly trusted vendor/trader here, Sugar Mama BTC. Some of the other safer methods weren&#039;t accessible in my country, and based on her reviews and general likeability here, I western union-ed the money to her according to her instructions. Communication was spot on up until my money went through.After a mail from her stating a runner was picking up the money, I never heard from her again. This was around 5:30 - 6 PM ET, and she mentioned she would be working yesterday up until 7 PM EST. By the MTCN wire tracking, I saw the money has been picked up/withdrawn. So far, no money in my BTC wallet and no response from her since. She mentioned she wouldn&#039;t be working up until Monday again, and I noticed that people on the forums here mention sometimes it took up to 4 days to process their funds (varying from an hour to a day to up to four days). I&#039;m trying not to freak out as this is my first transaction related to SR, but you can imagine my worry as someone who&#039;s motto is bitcoins within an hour has taken more than one day already to process the transfer. That alongside some clear red flags like no further communication, I&#039;m&nbsp; not exactly at ease that things are going the way I planned.<br /><br />Has anyone had any similar experiences or know what&#039;s going on? I guess I won&#039;t officially find out till Monday if I&#039;ve been scammed or not, but if anyone has any input/suggestions/experiences I&#039;d really like to hear from you.<br /><br />Thank you again to the community for your constant help to us noobs.<br /><br />Thanks.

				One other question did you do business with Sugar MAMA or a vendor that goes by Sugar MAMA BTC.<br /><br />Scout how do I turn off those damn emotion icons I&#039;m hitting the question key and getting smiley faces ..... if this poster has a legitimate problem I don&#039;t want him to think I&#039;m happy about it.

				So I found Sugar Mama&#039;s vendor page (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/aace915f06) , and noticed the e-mail on there and the e-mail I was corresponding to were different: <br /><br />sugarmama1@tormail.org (original) vs. sugarmamabtc@tormail.org (person I was corresponding with)<br /><br />Michael58, your concern was correct. I believe I got in touch with the wrong person. I found their e-mail address through some spam posts on this forum and some spam posts on reddit that this faker had posted. Is there a way to stop this asshole?<br /><br />Bad luck I guess :( Lost 350 $ just like that<br /><br />Anyone have any trusted bitcoin for Western Union traders as this seems to be the most easiest way to trade for BTC&#039;s in my country. <br /><br />Thanks

				Sorry guy ...... it sucks bad that these assholes troll SR like they do. Go to Coinxchange He is a trusted vendor and offers multiple ways to do the transfer. It will take about 24 hours to complete the transaction ..... it will cost you 8 % and there are definitely cheaper ways to go ...... most who use these 24 hour exchange services are generally impatient and want to do a transaction RIGHT NOW are you in North America ......there are other ways of getting coins but the process of setting up the accounts take about a week. Let me know what you want to do if you want to use coin exchange I will post a liink so you are sure to get the right vendor again man sorry you ripped But Kama is a bitch and the thieves will get whats coming to them eventually ..... Life is one big rotating plate

				Hey Whatwhat I noticed you mentioned my country so I will assume you are not in North America. I want to say 3 things and I don&#039;t want you to think I am beating on you after loosing $350 ...... but 1) don&#039;t EVER do business outside of SR ...... anyone asking you circumnavigate the safety of escrow and the resolution center is almost a guaranteed scam ...... If you are not doing business on a legitimate vendor page you are screwed. Second thing don&quot;t EVER finalize early there are a multitude of quality vendors that don&#039;t require FE. and last but not least when in doubt come to the forums and ask before you act the moderators here are awesome and do a great job helping the noobs navigate the gauntlets of doing business on SR. Hers is the link to coinxchange and best of luck<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/692778cd31

				damn.. I can&#039;t contribute anything useful but I wanna say I&#039;m really sorry you lost your money to some scamming scumbag. Those guys are the lowest of the low.. <br />Let this be a lesson to you and EVERYBODY BE CAREFUL YOU GOT THE RIGHT EMAIL/URL before doing any business or logging into any accounts. Always double check!<br />Anyway, cheer up! Those things happen and they can happen to anybody. Even if you might not get your money back, it&#039;s still a.. uhm... useful experience I guess. At last that&#039;s what I tell myself whenever something bad happens.

				He found the fake e-mail address on Reddit and on some spam threads on this forum. He checked feedback on the REAL Sugar MaMa in the forums and then contacted the imposter via e-mail and not thru the SR vendor pages ...... didn&#039;t think anything of the the imposter adding BTC to the end of Sugar MaMa and most noobs wouldn&#039;t have. It sucks and it was an expensive lesson but at least we know he will do things much differently next time around.

				We are sorry to hear that you lost your money. We were scammed when we started out as well... We know the feeling.... You should have searched sugarmama&#039;s name in the search window of your SR page and messaged her there... NEVER message outside of SR...REDDIT is practically a scam anyways... <br /><br />Look up JumboMonkeyBiscuit we can get you your coins<br /><br />JmB

				Hey man, Just wanted to say, join the club lol. Im sorry, I know it sucks. I lost out on a grand for bunk LSD vials last November. Just know, once your scammed once it wont happen again. You&#039;ll know who to buy from and who seems unworthy it. You&#039;ll be sharper and more attuned to these scumbags, and be able to spot them alot better. Everything has a lesson to be learned with it.

				Bad luck man, sounds like youve fallen victim to a scam. I think the only possibility of doing anything about this, is to contact WU and explain that you have sent someone money for a product and they have stolen your money. A big no-no would be to mention bitcoins, personally I would come up with another believable story, take your pick which. A person must have photo ID to collect a WU payment and (I think) also proof of address. Maybe its possible for WU to track down the person and do something about it. But I will say again - do not mention bitcoins and come up with another story. Even though bitcoins are not illegal, the chances of WU and/or police doing anything about it if you mention them are very slim<br /><br />Also, in case you want another way to buy bitcoins, which is pretty much 100% safe is localbitcoins.com. Ive used it and can recommend ti highly<br /><br />You sign up and numerous vendors selling bitcoins in your area become visible. When you agree to deal with someone, they then send the agreed amount of bitcoins to an escrow system within the localbitcoins.com website. It will be indicated to you that the bitcoins for the transaction have been funded into the escrow system, by the seller<br /><br />You then send money to the seller. This can be done by meeting in person and giving cash, a bank transfer, a WU payment, cheque..... etc<br /><br />When the seller receives the money, they enter the release code for the transaction, into thelocalbitcoins system and the funds will be sent to you<br /><br />Sellers have feedback there, you can see that they are legitimate, and the escrow system offers you full protection

				I think that, due to the nature of SR, the scammers, the customs officers, the sniffer dogs, the police, dodgy mailmen, that its pretty unlikely that you are every going to reside here and make transactions and never lose out<br /><br />Having said that, with a little more knowledge, this particular loss could have quite easily been avoided. Also, with more knowledge with regards to vendor choices and other varying aspects of any possible deals, it is possible to reduce your risk of loss<br /><br />But even so, anyone that does reside and deal here on a regular basis, is inevitably going to suffer a loss at some point or another.<br /><br />Its much like poker really. A high % of it is skill/knowledge. The rest... luck. Over longer periods of time/transactions, a person with more knowledge will have better results and less losses, and vice versa<br /><br />Michael, tried not to get too discouraged by your loss. As explained, it is inevitable in this neck of the woods. It is a costly lesson, but I once heard something that I believe is very true... experience is worth more than money, but experience is never free<br /><br />Maybe this experience that has cost you $350, will save you $350 or possibly more, somewhere down the line

				Thank you guys for the overwhelming support of the community. Assholes will be assholes, but I&#039;m over it now and will try again this week with some of the more reliable one&#039;s mentioned to me, such as blueskytraders. Thank you for all the help!
