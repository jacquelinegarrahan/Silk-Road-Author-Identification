				I&#039;ve been passing all of this info along to Vendor Support / SR Staff.&nbsp; Right now they are probably still busy with the attacks and dealing with whatever issues arose during the unreliable past week ... but I have every faith that as soon as they are able to, they will look into this and take care of it if they are able to find proof of scamming.<br /><br />In the meantime, DO NOT FINALIZE EARLY.

				I appreciate the feedback. <br /><br />My review has been adjusted to a 1/5 with an explanation, but it is now some 3 pages back so visibility is limited. There is also another review that mirrors exactly what happened with me, so Mr. Giancana has a pattern he&#039;s following. I also submitted a vendor report to SR admin, so hopefully that will help as well. If they need proof I have all of his communication saved, and the deal was registered through SR so there&#039;s a record of the transaction.<br /><br />I hate to bring all this out in public, but Sam isn&#039;t replying to my messages, and hasn&#039;t even read the last couple that were sent. The important thing is for others to be forewarned, though I fear there&#039;s much damage already been done far above and beyond my issue. <br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping he gets shut down. There are few things worse than douchbags committing douchbaggery.

				Add me to the list of people being ripped off by SamGiancana. luckily mine is just an attmept right now as I did not F/E luckily(only because I already fell for that and got ripped of twice by smooth talkers. no more) and He pulled the exact same Shtick as everyone else. first a fake usps tracking # (for a domestic order explain that one) then a message saying someone hacked his account and to resend info and he would get the real tracking # . from here he ignores every message/email and order was about to auto finalize so I put it into resoloution, just waiting on that now. <br />Man this guy is something else, so nice and sincere to begin with . and tons of people are F/E for his generous 20% extra from a &quot;trusted and stand up vendor&quot; i cant believe this<br />they really need to look at revising the rules for F/E, maybee abolish it for trusted buyers or something I dont know but the scams are getting bad.<br />

Nobody forces buyers to do it, yet people continue to claim that Silk Road needs to do something about it. I am sorry to hear that you got scammed in the past by vendors but if you make a conscious decision not to FE again - as you have done in this case - your money will be safe. You are a perfect example of somebody taking responsibility and deciding &quot;No, I won&#039;t go outside the protection of escrow because there&#039;s a chance I&#039;ll get scammed if I do.&quot; and you&#039;re completely right.<br /><br />Why on earth would people willfully remove the protection of escrow simply because they are promised 20% extra?! More importantly, how can people think that for every 100g that a vendor sends out, they would also send out 20g free?! The 20g is likely the majority of their profit margin! ???<br /><br />The mind boggles.<br /><br />Libertas

				you do have a valid point, its just I feel bad for the newbies who feel that have to F/E and also people (including myself) that forget to search the forums which I have also learned, It seems you need to get burned before you learn that Never F/E lesson unless your lucky enough to learn through these forums of all the people burned before it happens to you, but Yeah I thought that was a little outrages 20% when I got scammed the first time it was by TheTeflonDon. I didnt search the forums and he offered free express shipping for F/E which I fell for and the second time was by LucyDrop who was the top domestic lsd vendor for a long time with a stand up record who required everyone F/E because he only offered regular shipping and no refunds, It was bad timing that I decided to buy while he decided to go rouge <br /><br />either way I hate these scammers and Yes I learned my lesson and took responsibility :-)<br />
