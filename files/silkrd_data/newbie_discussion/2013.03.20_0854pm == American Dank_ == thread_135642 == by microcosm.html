				I&#039;ve tried a few vendors out and have been disappointed with the quality a couple of times. I hate having an abundance of weed that I&#039;m not terribly eager to smoke, but must anyway because it&#039;s not going to waste. I also have to agree with the thread on the main discussion page about how we get excited about the whole experience, and a new weed, and that can cause our reviews to be somewhat biased or just inaccurate. I am guilty of this myself, and find myself mostly ignoring the reviews as they may not be legitimate to begin with.<br /><br />Alas, I am a pot-snob. I love a heady, good tasting, perfectly cured, not terribly compressed by vacuum sealing dank. I have found weed on SR that gets me very high so I really can&#039;t complain... but i&#039;m looking for that weed you can bring home to mom and pop, and make a proper woman out of.<br />I have been looking at NorCalKing&#039;s listings all along, and at the start of the new year he started dealing with the newer members, which had me excited... but I have had a solid local connection and not a ton of cash to throw around on here. <br />NCK seems like a very reputable vendor... is the bud as dank as it looks? Any other US vendors you recommend I try?
