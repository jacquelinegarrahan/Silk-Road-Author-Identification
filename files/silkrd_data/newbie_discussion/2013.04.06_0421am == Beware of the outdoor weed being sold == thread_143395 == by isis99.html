				i recently bought a sack from NorCalKing.&nbsp; I got and 8th of his girl scout cookies. it was 65 dollars.&nbsp; I was so excited to try this strain.&nbsp; I normal do not ever buy weed since I have a medical marijuana card and I grow cannabis legally.&nbsp; I must proclaim that I am a pot snob of the highest order and consider myself a expert of the ganga.&nbsp; the order was great until i opened the bag containing the herb. &quot;FUCK&quot; this is some bullshit outdoor.&nbsp; Dark green vauge smell of lemon and mint.&nbsp; Very low quality.&nbsp; Ive had some bomb outdoor weed that could pass for indoor.&nbsp; This was not the case for this crap.&nbsp; I confronted NCK on the quality and how he is ripping people off.&nbsp; i didnt ank for a refund or anything but I did inform the vendor that i was going to be honest and leave appropriate feed back and reviews. His response was comical at best.&nbsp; He said either I&#039;m a vendor that is jealous or I don&#039;t like the sativa high. Lmao.<br /><br />the long and short of it is most of you out there dont even know how your getting robbed by these Cali vendors.&nbsp; Just because its not mexi brick weed doesn&#039;t make it dank.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Ill be bring my product to the SR in coming month or so.&nbsp; the real dank 100% indoor organic grown in a &quot;legal&quot; (lol) garden. Enough of the rapping and pillaging. its time for everyone to have the best for a good price..

				A lot of the good vendors fell off and this is what we are left with. I have noticed the same things with other vendors, I won&#039;t name names. You can&#039;t find a QP of &quot;dank&quot; to save your life on here&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Feedback system doesn&#039;t make it easy to express disappointment in a product but also not ding the seller&#039;s rating permanently. Which leads to sellers refusing to acknowledge issues, because they need to do everything to get that 5/5.

				You get what you pay for.&nbsp; Vendors from Cali are selling outdoor weed they buy for 1500 a lb.&nbsp; i grow indoor small garden boutique cannabis it cost a lot of money and time to produce&nbsp; top shelf medical grade cannabis.&nbsp; you can pay less but again you get what you pay for.&nbsp; &nbsp; . Sure you can get some decent bud for 250 and oz or 900 to 1000 a qp but its not going to be what we like to call LOUD AS FUCK.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who knows good weed knows when they fire comes around its sure as fuck no less than 275-300 a oz.&nbsp; I actuality have friends that sell my bud for 120 a qter still and i live in a med state so there is no shortage of good bud going around. I get the feeling like so many buyers on the road are on the east coast and have only been exposed to besters calli outdoor, mxi and then somehome gown with some dank thrown int there somewhere&nbsp; Not all dope growers are created equal. Not all bud is created equal.&nbsp;

				hmm I see your point. I am not in a med state, quite far from one actually, so its difficult to increase prices to clientele when they are not used to buying q&#039;s for 120. If I told my people for a q it was 120 and it was indeed LOUD as fuck, thats almost buying 7 dubs for 20 each, they would just move on to the next connect on there phone.

				that&nbsp; just tells you you have seen nothing but sub par bud. Sorry to hear.&nbsp; I guess a good way to put ot would be to think about it on terms of a luxury item. like single malt scotch or Grand Cru Bordeaux..&nbsp; Your just not going to get fine grade A without paying for it.&nbsp; And to be honest thats a pretty fair price&nbsp; &nbsp; But to be perfectly honest it sounds like your demographic couldn&#039;t afford it anyways.

				Sounds alot like what people on the streets are doing because of the unpopularity of the midgrade weed... ppl have resorted to telling newb smokers and experienced mid smokers that decent outdoor is dro or chronic. sorry for your mislead but like any ROAD physical/cyber you have to expect the worse SOMETIMES... Im sure you know this just letting other new ppl know the SR is not that different than your back alley.

I&#039;m just trying to get 50 posts and I&#039;m pissed because I got a weak sack out bunk weed. I wouldn&#039;t have to steal anyone&#039;s business,s my weed sells it self and I live in a highly saturated market.&nbsp; It use to be BC bud that got passed around as dark to east coasters now its cali outdoor.&nbsp; I used to get beaters that blew Cali outdoor butt hole.

				I&#039;m sorry you are so upset by your purchase, however I don&#039;t agree with the label that outdoor weed is always sub-par. A very good grower can make some wonderful outdoor and an average grower can make some really average indoor. If the vendor is lying about his listing then that is a more valid argument you should be making.
