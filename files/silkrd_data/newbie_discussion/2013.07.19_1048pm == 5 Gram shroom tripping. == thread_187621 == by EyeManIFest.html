				Who&#039;s tried a dose of that caliber before?<br /><br />I love high dose summer trips to mushroom land, especially If they are strong; they put me in superman mode. Have you? Would you EVER try a heroic dose?

				I did 4.5 or 4.75 ish once.&nbsp; It was intense but not life changing.&nbsp; The colors were intense, and I could not grasp a thought to save my life.&nbsp; My mind just started running at a million miles per hour, but each thought had my complete focus for the moment I had it.&nbsp; Then, that thought would be gone and I couldn&#039;t reach back in my memory to try to structure together some sort of chain of thought.&nbsp; Just a string of intense thoughts, one after another, for hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a hot day, and I couldn&#039;t tell if I was feeling short of breath and sweaty because I was hot or because I was dying.&nbsp; I spent what felt like a long time grappling with the genuine thought that I might actually be dying.&nbsp; I just couldn&#039;t tell if something was actually wrong, or if it was the drugs.&nbsp; Finally I came to terms with things and decided if I was going to die, it was a good day to die and a nice place to do it.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				That a awesome first post. I know exactly what you mean by saying i didn&#039;t know if i was dying or not lol.&nbsp; I had that happen twice on shrooms, i started reassured myself i didn&#039;t feel hurt or poisoned, and nobody dies on shrooms.&nbsp; Then BOOM. Everything opens up, and i feel invincible.&nbsp; The most special part is when you get those streams of thought and innerconnectivity of life images.&nbsp; turn into some sort of psychedelic mind puzzle, you can sit and play. It&#039;s like being inside a interactive video game.<br /><br />
