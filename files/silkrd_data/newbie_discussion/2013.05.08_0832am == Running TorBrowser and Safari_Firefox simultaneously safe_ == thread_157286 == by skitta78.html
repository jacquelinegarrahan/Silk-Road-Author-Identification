				Hi All,<br />A tech question from a Newbie. If you are on SR on TorBrowser is it safe to have Safari or any other web brower running at the same time?<br />I like to use Youtube music playlist and have them playing is Safari in the background while Im logged on to SR through Tor. I dont know if this is a safety issue and might reveal my IP or whatever. If its not safe to do what about running iTunes in the background while on SR is that any safer? <br />I can be logged on to SR for half the day and its just nice to have some music playing while I go about SR activities.&nbsp; I use my Mac as basically my only music player and I like being on Youtube cos I dont have to buy music since everything is on there and you can create a playlist of the songs you like and they just play for free. <br />Anyone got any advice if this is safe or not. I tend not to do this since Im unsure but it would be good if you could.&nbsp;

				I could have done some reading on this somewhere but I thought it would have been more widely known and Id get a quick answer.<br />Ill have to look into this. I have Black Sun Empire playing in Youtube as I write this. I cant live without music.

				Yes, it should be safe. The Tor developers design TorBrowser to be as isolated as possible. NoScript blocks Flash and Java from running, and many of the worst JavaScript vulnerabilities are blocked by Torbutton and patches to Firefox (TorBrowser).<br /><br />The biggest risk is human error, ie, doing something in TorBrowser and then in your clearnet browser which would allow someone to correlation your anonymous activities with your real identity activities.
