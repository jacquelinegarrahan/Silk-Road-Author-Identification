				I transferred some in a couple days ago-it was a 6 hour long transfer from Bitcoin fog-so it was well into late night past 11pm before finished-I took note of how much before I went to bed. The next morning when I went to place my order there was a dollar and some change gone-not much but still it was mine! I chalked it up to me being a newbie-and thought that&#039;s probably just how SR wallet works-use it quick after deposit! Guess this is NOT normal... plus my full amount that was supposed to come over from Bitcoin fog was about 10.00 less than it should have been-I blamed bitcoinfog-and gave them a reaming in support.... maybe SR ate it during transfer and it had nothing to do with Bitcoinfog after all. Hmmmm

				Scurry, you know I appreciate the situation you are in, but there&#039;s no need to incite panic by spamming the forums with your warnings.&nbsp; Many people have had no issues making deposits and withdrawals.&nbsp; This is not a site-wide issue.&nbsp; It is an issue with some individual accounts.<br /><br />Also, please remember that DPR and the admin have lives outside of SR .... it is very possible that, since it is the weekend, they may be busy or out of town or away from the computer.

				For it being the first time I did anything with SR let alone btc. It went like a gravey train on bisqut wheels. I was pleased with how it was handled by the methods I used. There are going to be issues, for those issues. there has to be patience. You have to remember what this is. And what you&#039;re doing. You have to be in the mindset that this could happen. You have to be mentally prepared for if the cops show up. All that shit. If you&#039;re not, logout. <br /><br />This has only by my opinion. It has been brought to you by the letter 36.

				When i check the address SR told me to deposit the coins to (1FSUX63QzsnEKjN8deXtRsHg6zz4vu4kKf) on Blockchain.info i see that the bitcoins where sent away to another address... What does this mean?<br />Just to clarify, i definitely didn&#039;t send to fake SR site, checked and double checked URL before sending.<br />So, Scout, what i&#039;m really asking is if there is anything at all i can do to help my situation?

				&nbsp;;)&nbsp; I maybe the one who in the end gets nailed, but I kinda doubt it. I say this because I do it through MG-ZZ-BI-MG-SR put just under 2k through and the longest it has ever taken was a couple of hours..All and all these moves cost around 15-16 usd, no big deal for peace of mind. But I KNOW AND BELIEVE BUYING THESE COINS ARE LEGAL....SO WHY HIDE??? Unless your dealing in 10&#039;s or 100&#039;s of k&#039;s...

Hmmmm<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anabri, remember how bitcoin is like a currency, such as the dollar, yen, and euro.&nbsp; They have a value against your currency, for example the dollar, and that changes over time.&nbsp; You can check the latest, high, and low dollar to bitcoin prices on an exchange, most notably mtgox dot com.&nbsp; Clearnet warning - https://mtgox.com<br /><br />So what happened was that you went to bed and the price of bitcoin dropped slightly.&nbsp; SR seems to adjust to the weighted average, so sudden spikes and drops don&#039;t move the value drastically and I assume that there must be a time by which SR updates its bitcoin to dollar/euro values.&nbsp; You can see that weighted average on the mtgox dot com page.<br /><br />Some vendors price their product pegged to the dollar, so the cost of the items in bitcoins will change.&nbsp; I think that other times, vendors may charge a fixed bitcoin fee, regardless of the dollar amount.&nbsp; So, if you deposit a bunch of bitcoin in your account and the price of bitcoins goes up while they are in your account, guess what?&nbsp; You have more money to play with!&nbsp; Conversely if the price of bitcoin drops, you may have less buying power.&nbsp; So if you don&#039;t want to risk it, only put in what you are going to spend right away.<br /><br />Also, Blue Sky Traders uses different metrics to calculate their price for bitcoin.&nbsp; If you look on their webpage it talks about the minimum ask price being what you will probably get for a rate.&nbsp; Bitcoin trading prices go up and down alot, it was probably just the price difference between when you asked and when they were able to buy...<br /><br />blahblah1234

				It seems like what is happening is that deposits and withdrawals are getting stuck in SR&#039;s system.&nbsp; What I mean is, withdrawals are registering within SR so that the bitcoins are taken out of accounts as usual but then they get stuck somewhere before registering on the network, and never appear on blockchain.<br /><br />Similarly, with deposits, they make it to SR but then get stuck somewhere before being credited to the user&#039;s account.<br /><br />This reaffirms to me that maybe all that needs to happen is for SR Support to push the &quot;stuck&quot; transactions manually in both directions.
