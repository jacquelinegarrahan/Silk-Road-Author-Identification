				Iv been a vendor for a year on SR. I found the resolution of SR to be insane:<br />How can it be that a person who orders a small amount twice, then larger amount and says &quot;not delivered&quot; gets a 100% refund? <br />Now im pretty much broke.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />If any new vendor reads this.. Dont give escrow after the mandatory 35 escrows! Make a seller account on BMR to have an alrternative!<br />BMR: http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/

				Wait, so they ordered two small and one big order from you, and the total amount for all three orders got refunded to him because the big one &quot;didn&#039;t make it?&quot; I am just trying to understand what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />Plus, BMR is not nearly as established as SR is... and they may not appreciate you linking out to them lol :P but I have heard it&#039;s like 99% scammers on there anyway. I dunno. Can you appeal the decision? Seems like there may be more to the story than that.

				Careful what you say,. . .&nbsp; SR has been at this for a long time.&nbsp; They seen it all.<br /><br />If you are unhappy with escrow resolution, then it&#039;s because you didn&#039;t do your job of keeping proof of delivery and postal records.&nbsp; SR uses that info to decide if it was delivered or not.&nbsp; If tracking data says it was delivered then it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But if if was delivered and stuck in transit somewhere then it got nabbed due to poor packaging or whatever ..&nbsp; = partial refund or reship.<br /><br />If it says it did&#039;t make it to a post sorting facility, then it wasn&#039;t sent out or it got lost on the way to the post office/stolen from mailbox. = 100% refund.<br /><br />Do you have proof you sent it?&nbsp; It should be enough to prove the scammer wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also,&nbsp; many vendors don&#039;t realize that their couriers and &#039;workers&#039; are occasionally stealing a package here and there .&nbsp; &nbsp;Vendors don&#039;t want to believe it but its definitely true and causes a lot of confusion.<br /><br />Shit, I never order nothing without tracking and I use it too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe this scam is still working though.. . Like as if.&nbsp; There must be a way to prove it was delivered though.&nbsp; <br />

				I would say a 100% refund isn&#039;t necessarily unfair.<br /><br />The package may have been intercepted or stolen during transit. Don&#039;t take that bad, but intercepted package are mostly seller&#039;s responsability. Even the most honest customer can&#039;t do the packaging for you.<br /><br />And if the package got lost, it either was detected by it&#039;s external aspect, smell or just terrible bad luck. For the two firsts, you are mostly responsible to limit risks as much as possible.<br /><br />If you are &quot;broke&quot; after some refunds, then maybe something isn&#039;t right in your pricing. As any business, you should keep emergency cash to at least partially compensate for the loss to scammer and legitimately lost packages.<br /><br />Even a perfect seller, using top notch stealth package will eventually lose some packages and have to refund too...

				From a customer perspective, I don&#039;t expect a 100% refund from a reputable vendor if a package doesn&#039;t arrive.&nbsp; It is a shared risk, and you are purchasing something anonymously from the internet.&nbsp; Honestly, I go into it expecting to be ripped off on every purchase, so if something shows up it&#039;s a bonus.
