				Wait. If and when you receive it that&#039;s when you finalize the transaction asap, then submit accurate feedback. If it has been three days shipping I can&#039;t imagine it would take to much longer unless it is going around the world. If for some reason it doesn&#039;t come after a reasonable amount of time try to contact the seller... then find someway to resolve the issue. I get so excited around day three although it sometimes takes a few more days.

				in transit means the vendor has posted your order. Just a matter of waiting for it turn up now. <br /><br />Remember to finalize (and release your cash from escrow) as soon after you get your package as possible.<br /><br />

				5 days.<br /><br />I recently shipped a firearm within the state (U.S.) I live in. Shipped it priority. Estimated delivery was 3 days, but it actually took 6 business days. Legal, paperwork, FFL, etc...<br /><br />Regular priority (not just firearms) can get held up. Sequestration is in play, even if all the cuts haven&#039;t happened yet. It&#039;s already affecting morale, work ethic, etc.<br /><br />Also, spend all your extra time between posts reading the Security and Shipping Discussion boards. There&#039;s an infinite wealth of knowledge there.

				I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned for 3 days, especially if it is domestic. Once it get&#039;s to 5 days though, maybe like others have said contact the seller.
