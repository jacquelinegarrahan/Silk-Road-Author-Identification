				Just to let you know that BIG BROTHER is alive and well at telstra. On an android device that is a throwaway unit i have for different reasons , thats irrellevant anyway. With the device sometimes access the road through tor2web,this has been about six weeks. Went to use the device(tablet that is more secure than any pc or whatever as not reg to anyone,so forget lectures on security please) to do a check on something to find no matter which standard browser used, any address containing tor2web .onion.o was unable to be found. Before redlighting myself or situation, i checked with a telstra person who knows and is a customer of mine. The reason on account was that the block was indeed there and it was highlighted as (suspected of hosting illegal content). To fix the problem for me was easy enough with a vpn. But in Australia good old telstra is confirmed to be keeping a watch on your internet activities. So if they have done this to the pre paid account mentioned,how many other are they monitoring or are feds monitoring.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;With all respect, they probably did you a favour :) Accessing tor through anything but the tor browser or one of the secure OS&#039;s, like tails, is not safe. Even the tor browser has recently proven itself susceptible to leo attacks. Your anonymity is precious.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was using an ios tor app for a while, but I&#039;m not sure how safe these apps are. The US govt has a secret court, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, that issues secret orders to companies demanding they create backdoors for, or allow data mining by, their national security apparatuses. The tor apps may be able to be compromised as they&#039;re created by private companies/individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Aus government is a member of the 5 eyes intelligence community, which gives them extensive access to the intelligence gathering capabilities of the US and Britain, along with our govt&#039;s own not at all insignificant powers of intrusion. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year the AFP acquired over 50,000 secret electronic tapping warrants. More than a thousand a week. They won&#039;t hesitate to hoover up your data and begin building a profile of your activities. Telstra has admitted to providing secret access to their systems for US and British intelligence agencies in exchange for permissions to invest in areas that these govt&#039;s control and regulate.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think we have been fortunate that most of these immense powers, but somewhat limited resources, have been directed at the almost entirely bogus War On Terror. If they were to begin to focus upon the SR community, fully bring to bear upon us their tyrannical might, many would be at serious risk of identification and incarceration.

				Yeh i use orbot, orweb,&nbsp; duck duck on my stuff and tbb on pc. I put it here for those not using it. But then again accessing proxy is not illegal so why they block it. I would like to see them pursue someone for breach of contract refusing to pay on grounds they are censoring content. Its Australia im talking about here not China guys. :)
