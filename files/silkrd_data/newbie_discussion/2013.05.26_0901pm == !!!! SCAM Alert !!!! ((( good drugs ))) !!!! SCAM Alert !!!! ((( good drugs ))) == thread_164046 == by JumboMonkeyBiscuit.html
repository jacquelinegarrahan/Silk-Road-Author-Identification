				Guys ....is it GOOD DRUGS or GOOD DRUG ?????? I did not see a listing for Good Drug when I did a search on SR but I did find a Good Drugs vendor but he didn&#039;t have ANYTHING on his vendor page about buying or selling bitcoins. It is possible to have 2 vendors with similar names and I know we wouldn&#039;t want to throw the wrong vendor under the bus ..... Am I missing something here ?? I have seen multiple threads on this vendor with an even split on which vendor name they are calling out
