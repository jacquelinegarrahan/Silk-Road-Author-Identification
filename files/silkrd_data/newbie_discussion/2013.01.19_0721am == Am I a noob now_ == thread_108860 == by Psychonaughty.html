				I can not reply to posts or start topics anywhere anymore all of a sudden, except for here.<br /><br />Why? Is there a new number of posts count rule or something?<br />If so then where can I read about it and how many posts do I need in order to reply in other topics again?

				Yes 50, so you are almost there.&nbsp; And I&#039;m guessing its a hundred to give karma.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I kind of think it should go by time as a member and posts combined.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would make a little more sense.

				well some of us like to post quality--not just quantity--and when we do post those few times--it would be nice to let the community decide our &#039;rank&#039; in the system i.e. by the quality of our contribution--not by the count of our entries--its all good--

				Easy answer: because 99% of the forum became unusable.<br /><br />Where was there a notice of this? I would have at least expected a pm about it.<br /><br />And what will people with new accounts do? Spam shit posts in order to use the forum?<br />As a method on the btc sell shit spam?<br /><br />This is not a logical solution.<br />SR also had some problem and pics of vendors had btc addresses in them.<br /><br />Starting now I am officially worried that SR is what they claim to be. which is being technically of high quality.<br />This is a new method, besides already having to type the fucking capchta every time.<br />On some drugs those can not be read anymore and then posting something is a nearly impossible task.<br /><br />How will people give a review on the forum now, if they first need to get 50 posts?<br />

This post limit keeps me from being able to do that. I really don&#039;t want to post reviews of products or vendors in the newbie section. I feel people would get more use from reviews when they&#039;re in the threads they&#039;re suppose to be in. At least it makes it more convenient for people, right?

				Wonder how long this will last. Don&#039;t think the admins would keep it if the community rejected. Although, perhaps it&#039;s a better idea to weed out spammers using the newbie section.

				Absolutely, the 50 posts rule is a good one for exactly that reason. Weeding out spammers. I&#039;m doing my best to get to 50 organically, but I must confess I occasionally usethe SPAM HERE TO GET TO 50 threads :/

				50 posts mean you have presumably read some posts, which means you may have accessed information and perhaps even learned something. information=knowledge=power.<br />Dig?&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)
