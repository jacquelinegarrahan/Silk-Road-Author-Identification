				Just wondering if anyone has received anything from Foxbelle77.<br /><br />I had a 50g order and lost $800 to her :(<br /><br />Heard people got the same tracking number but I didn&#039;t even receive a tracking number.

				i just placed a 100g order right before she dissapeared. i thought her 271 transactions was good enough evidence that she wasnt a scammer. hoping she went stealth to expedite all her current orders.<br /><br />also i cant find her thread anymore either????<br /><br />

				It would have helped if people we&#039;re more comprehensive in their packaging analysis. Not that details should ever be used, but there are certain things that are unacceptable (against the rules) and need to be discussed! Handwritten labels for domestic shipments just doesn&#039;t add up to me, but it took a long time for people to mention this in her thread.

				Very strange situation, hard to say whether it was a scam or not. I certainly agree with others who have said that the whole &#039;girl&#039; thing was slightly suspicious, especially with her cutesy name and messages. Stereotyping is wrong and all that but honestly, how many drug dealers do you know that are women? I&#039;ve only ever heard of one. Could certainly have been a ploy to get people to trust her more. Also, she was trying just a bit too hard to make friends, with her generous samples and overweight orders. My 10g order weighed in at over 11.5g and it was crushed so clearly the weight was intentional. Good business is selling exact weights at good prices and letting the product speak for itself. Thirdly, her pricing structure was far too suspicious. It was something like 17BTC for 10g and 25-26 for 25g? None of the established sellers have such aggressive discounts for bulk orders, even 100g+, look at frank matthews for example. Still, considering the great service and the top quality of the first 10g, I went straight in for a 25g order.<br />But she cancelled it. Why on earth would she cancel it and give up ~Â£250 if she was cutting and running? And assuming she wasn&#039;t scamming, a lot of the packages sent last week could still be in the system, considering the snow. She was getting loads of orders last week, her feedback was like FE, FE, FE, several times an hour. If none had arrived, there would be far far more posts on the forum. It could be that all we are seeing are those whose packages have been delayed and they&#039;re getting nervous. Those who have received their order cant be bothered to post here. But that doesn&#039;t explain the apparent duplicate tracking numbers. So, my best guess is:<br />She started off not wanting to scam, and had a really good connect to high quality product. Her prices were incredible, but still a massive mark up on what it costs to manufacture this chemical, so it&#039;s not unfeasible.<br />Things quickly got out of hand due to her great service and prices, and she accepted more orders than she had product and/or her supply dried up. When she realised, she freaked and shut down her account, automatically cancelling all orders that had not been accepted. But considering that she wasnt going to be selling anymore anyway, she had no incentive other than ethics to reverse finalised orders that she couldnt fulfill, and so tried to fob them off with fake/duplicate tracking numbers.

				It&#039;s a strange case indeed. A friend bought 10 Grams from her, received it the next day (last Tuesday), was delighted with the product and instantly moved to purchase a further 25 Grams but she told him to leave it until after the weekend as they were swamped with international orders. Now either she&#039;s the most conscientious scammer who&#039;s ever lived or there&#039;s another explanation to this. I&#039;m sincerely hoping for everyone who has coin tied up in this that it&#039;s the latter.
