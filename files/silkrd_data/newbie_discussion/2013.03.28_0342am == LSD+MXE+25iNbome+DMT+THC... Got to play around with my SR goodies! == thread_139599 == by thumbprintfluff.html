				&nbsp;Well my stash box is pretty up to par minus a few goodies I&#039;m still waiting on..&nbsp; So I tried a little experiment seeing as I had a few days off. I dropped 140mcgs acid. When that kicked in (had ready b4 hand), I vaped about a milligram 25inbome off some foil, then plunged 50 mgs MXE into my theigh, and took a big fat bong hit.<br />&nbsp; I must say for the first half hour or so, the MXE played king, but all in all I was just there. For all of us that know that&#039;s all it was. When I was capable of smoking DMT it got really visual for about 5 mins. But the whole mixing thing was a bit overboard. Have had much better trips just using one or the other. But don&#039;t get me wrong it was interesting and a learning experience, but could of done minus the mxe/nbome or both<br />&nbsp; But hey, if I could go back 20 some years and show off my current stash box vs my 1990&#039;s stash box my friends and I would probably nut all over ourselves!<br />&nbsp; Thanks SR!

				Dude I don&#039;t think mixing that many different types of psychedelics is a good idea. Maybe stick to 1 class, or at a maximum 2 classes.
