				I&#039;ve been around here for a LONG time, but a security reason I changed to a new user name and deleted all my old posts. I didn&#039;t post much, just mainly to report on vendors etc. Recently, there have been several posts where I could have offered meaningful input, but of course couldn&#039;t. Now I just read them. <br />Now that newbies are effectively locked out of discussions, their ability to respond in the other forums is gone along with some worthwhile input. Many folks only respond when they have something important to post, which translates to a low post count. <br /><br />The 50 post limit does have benefits, which is obvious. However, I think there might have been a better way to impose it. For one example, I would think that if the 50 post limit were imposed on all accounts that were less than 30 days old, that would have solved the problem w/o penalizing everybody. Anyway, I think I&#039;ll go to the spam thread and build up my post count.....
