				Just completed my first transaction on the site and everything went perfectly.&nbsp; Thought I&#039;d ask the forums about this though:<br /><br />After sending my shipping info (encrypted with PGP, ofc), I received a tracking number sent back from vendor in plaintext.&nbsp; Is this standard procedure?&nbsp; It kind of seems to defeat the purpose of encrypting my address in the first place if information directly tying our transaction to the status of a package is going to be sent back to me unencrypted.&nbsp; When placing an order with other vendors, should I ask that any correspondence be encrypted?&nbsp; Should I have to?<br /><br />I suppose it could also be chalked up to user error....I didn&#039;t send a my PGP key along with my shipping info...would he need my public key in order to encrypt his message?&nbsp; That&#039;s about all I could think of.<br /><br />I sent a reply asking the vendor about it, and didn&#039;t mention it in the positive feedback I left.&nbsp; While I wait for his response, I thought I&#039;d see what some more of the more experienced users of SR have to say on it.

				Sometimes, I think it&#039;s kind of absurd to use PGP to encrypt information that will then be written on a box full of drugs and sent out into meatspace for all to see. I get that seeing an address in the context of SR is different, but even then, given the nature of a hidden service, if LE were able to see internal communications between users on SR, you might be fucked anyway.<br /><br />That said, the vendor does need your public key to encrypt a message to you. It&#039;s certainly ok to ask that they send messaged using encryption, and it&#039;s also ok to take your business elsewhere if the vendor ignores the request.<br />

				Yes, others need your Public Key to encode messages for you, just as you need their Public Key to encode messages for them. As soon as you&#039;re able to post outside of the Newbie forum, you can place your Public Key here so others may find it:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.0<br /><br />Of course, this really only helps if you use the same name on the Forum as you do on the Road.<br /><br />As I see it, the only real danger in NOT encrypting your address is physical seizure of the server hardware. Sure, LE can&#039;t use the internet to find it (thank you Tor), but they can use other means. Unencrypted addresses will be the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;, and will most likely receive unwanted attention.

				Thank you both for your replies.&nbsp; I guess I worded my question about the public key wrong...I know that he needed my pub key in order to encrypt a message to me, but for some reason I was under the impression that the encrypted message I sent him would contain the information necessary for him to be able to reply to me.<br /><br />Thanks also for the link to post my pub key, will probably be very useful.<br />

				A tracking number won&#039;t show your address so it&#039;s not totally necessary to encrypt it but now that you mention it maybe it&#039;d be better.

				I&#039;ve never had a vendor encrypt tracking info. I&#039;ve dealt with a couple handfuls of vendors. Some vendors don&#039;t even respond to messages and definitely don&#039;t provide tracking.

				As a vendor, I rarely track - not the best option really for most cases...<br /><br />But if I do, and this is occasional...I send it encrypted - I agree it seems overkill if you&#039;re printing the address and sending...BUT...should a computer fall into the hands you prefer it not to, then surely it&#039;s best for there to be absolutely no trace of your addresses?...<br /><br />Or is that me just being too paranoid on your behalf..?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Cheers all...oh and if you want a vendor who really does care, does bother with decent security and sends excellent stealth packs out quickly (and is a friendly guy to boot...)...then you know where to head!<br /><br />Doc
