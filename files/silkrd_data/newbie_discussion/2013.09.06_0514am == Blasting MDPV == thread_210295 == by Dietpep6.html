				MDPV= bathsalts right? If so its cool if I shoot them right? I shot white lightning and cloud nine and was fine but I&#039;ve been out of the game for a while so I&#039;m not too sure about if this is the right drug I am looking for.<br /><br />Also anyone in the NC area know where any head shops might sell these?<br /><br />-Thanks<br />Diet Pep

				MDPV isn&#039;t equal to &quot;Bathsalts&quot;. MDPV is a research chemical an often described as the drug with the worst comedown at all. <br />You only need very small amounts of 5-15mg (oral/insufflated) for a pleasant high with hard comedown and much stronger craving than caused by cocaine. Very low doses like 1mg MDPV already cause noticeable effects on the human mind and body! <br /><br />MDPV is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and as a reuptake inhibitor you&#039;ll strongly increase the positive effects (euphoria, creativity, ability to respond, concentrativeness, this feeling of knowing everything you touch will be absolutely perfect, and so on..) by DOING something like writing, talking to people, gaming (you really have to try this out! gaming on MDPV is AMAZING), Sex (will either end never or will end extremely crazy so that you better never talk about this plenty hours of performing Satan&#039;s most perverted and most morbid sexual imaginations) and so on..<br /><br />When comingdown all positive effects will turn to the opposite (the more you consume the stronger will be the comingdown), which can result in very strong anxious, strong speech disorder, movement disorders, depressions (sometimes with suicidal thougths) and so on. These hangover will last 1-2hours. <br /><br />Enough of my thoughts about MDPV. Back to &quot;Bathsalts&quot;:<br /><br /><br />For example &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; contained a mix of MDPV and the much less potent Cathinone &quot;Mephedrone&quot; (oral: 150mg+; insufflated: 25-75mg). These MIXTURE of MDPV and Mephedrone (not the substance MDPV itself) and many other mixtures of different research chemicals were selled as &quot;Bathsalts&quot; because only the human consumption was forbidden and selling them as &quot;Bathsalts&quot; was in a legal limbo.<br /><br />SmoothUp
