				Man, I&#039;ve spent the last WEEK studying all this stuff and my mind is in JUMBLES.&nbsp; Just when I think I&#039;ve got it all down, I read something else that leads me to believe I am not going to do something right!&nbsp; The last 2 days have been PGP to my DOME!&nbsp; AHHH!<br /><br />Anyways, so I bought 1.5 btc on COINBASE on Monday.&nbsp; This is my first purchase and they will be in my wallet on Friday (tomorrow).&nbsp; I am going to be ready to transfer them to SR immediately!<br /><br />So my question is, am I missing a step?&nbsp; Can I transfer my coins directly from my coinbase account to SR?&nbsp; Do I have to move my btc from coinbase to an outside wallet, then into my SR wallet?&nbsp; <br /><br />Can someone just explain this LAST step to me?&nbsp; After an entire week of studying it all boils down to tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; I just need to know this one last detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;COINBASE &gt;&nbsp; ?????&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Silk Road Wallet code ?

				Yes it is considered a wallet.&nbsp; On the main page as soon as you login you can click &quot;send money&quot; and send it to any bitcoin address you&#039;d like.&nbsp; If you go to account tools and then integration you can see your the bitcoin address for your wallet if you ever wanted to send bitcoins from SR back to coinbase.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend doing a coin tumble by sending it to another wallet or two instead of going straight from coinbase into SR.&nbsp; Blockchain.info will allow you to easily setup a free wallet.&nbsp; <br /><br />So you go from coinbase to blockchain.info to another wallet on blockchain.info or another site to SR.&nbsp; <br />

				So you would just send straight from your coinbase wallet where you bought the coines?&nbsp; Are you aware that when you buy from coinbase it comes directly from your bank account?&nbsp; There is nothing close to anonymous about coinbase.&nbsp; Is it still safe?&nbsp;

				- USB running Tor, for browsing Silk Road<br />- USB with PGP installed on an encrypted hidden volume, for sending address<br />- Localbitcoins.com for purchasing coins<br /><br />My coins go from the localbitcoins seller, into a temp blockchain wallet and then into SR.

				do not use coinbase to buy BTC that you transfer to SR...coinbase is linked directly to you...you are MUCH safer buying coins from localbitcoins.com via cash deposit at a bank and then moving around from there (still on Tor if you want)...it is the fastest, most anonymous way and then you have bitcoins that are not tied to you or your ID in any way.<br /><br />i have used this guy on many occasions because he is so fast as you can see by his feedback<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ad/22396/purchase-bitcoin-cash-deposit-chase-bank-united-states<br /><br />there are other methods to buy like mailing cash, but that is by far the fastest and most efficient.<br /><br />DO NOT use coinbase to buy coins for illicit ends<br /><br />take care!

				i use coinbase for legit distribution of BTC, but not for illicit activities...you are wise to use Local BTC as it will just take any chance that you will be tied to coins that got used for bad things.&nbsp; Coinbase does have your social sec info, your bank account, name, birthday, how many freckles you have, etc.&nbsp; It should be only used for redistribution of coins in my opinion<br /><br />

I wish I could find another guy who was selling them for the $96 range like everyone else, but able to do BOFA or Chase deposits to. <br /><br />If anyone finds another person who is selling coins through a Bank of America or Chase bank deposit, I would love to deal with them for my future coins. <br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />

				I think several people are not quite thinking straight.&nbsp; Let me clarify:&nbsp; what they&#039;re saying about purchasing BTC through localbitcoins being the best way to do it is, without a doubt, true.&nbsp; However, insisting that it is unsafe to purchase BTC through Coinbase for use on SR is misinformation, in my opinion.<br /><br />Yes, Coinbase knows who you are.&nbsp; They have your social security number, name, and bank account information.&nbsp; However, purchasing BTC is legal.&nbsp; Once you have BTC, who you send them to is completely anonymous.&nbsp; Deposit addresses for Silk Road accounts are not in any way tied to Silk Road, they&#039;re just BTC addresses.&nbsp; There is no distinguishing a Silk Road address from a non-Silk Road address.&nbsp; Every time you deposit coins into Silk Road, get a new deposit address.&nbsp; That way, it consistently looks like you&#039;re sending BTC to different people.&nbsp; Silk Road tumbles coins on top of that, so really there is nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Even if you&#039;re investigated by LE, all they will be able to tell is that you&#039;ve purchased Bitcoins.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Investment, of course.&nbsp; They can&#039;t prove otherwise.&nbsp; Or, making small donations or purchases from people you know in real life.&nbsp; There is no link between destination addresses and Silk Road, especially if you&#039;re consistently sending them to new deposit addresses.<br /><br />In other words, you&#039;re fine buying BTC on Coinbase for Silk Road.&nbsp; If you get busted, Coinbase will not be the reason why.&nbsp; It&#039;s certainly the most convenient method of buying Bitcoins once you have a Level 2 Account.&nbsp; I can decide I want some drugs, have Bitcoin less than 30 seconds later, wait an hour for them to deposit into my SR account, and then place my order.&nbsp; It&#039;s not for those who are overly paranoid about security, simply on principle.&nbsp; And being overly paranoid can be a good thing.&nbsp; I personally am extremely careful about many things, buying Bitcoin is not one of them simply due to the anonymous nature of the currency in the first place.&nbsp; Picking one&#039;s battles, and all that.

				I agree completely with awkward. Having used coinbase now for a few months and being a personal use buyer, I have nothing but good things to say about coinbase. <br /><br />If your goal is to stay anonymous throughout the whole process, then coinbase isn&#039;t for you. If you understand bit coins aren&#039;t illegal to buy and use some common sense tumbling your coins, I see no inherent danger using coinbase. At least, it&#039;s working for me and I have none of the problems I am seeing recently in the forums; &quot;how do I ever get bitcoins?&quot;...<br /><br />I can have them in my SR account within an hour of deciding to buy them.

				So I purchased my coins through COINBASE.&nbsp; I then transfered them into a BLOCKCHAIN wallet (just as EXTRA precaution, then transfered into SILKROAD.&nbsp; Once the coins were in my coinbase account (took 4 days and will take that long for the first month I have the account, then it goes to level 2 and is instant transfers), it only took about 2-3 hours until I was able to shop on Silk Road.&nbsp; It was seamless and simple, and I feel very anonymous once it left my COINBASE account.

				i was under the impression that websites can tell that you&#039;re sending funds to SR. That the wallet address for your SR account is &quot;labeled&quot; as being sent to SR. Like if you&#039;re on coinbase and you send money to ur SR address, there is evidence that the address ur sending it to is on the SR domain.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if i&#039;m explaining that clearly enough but I would never send coin from anywhere that has my personal i.d. info straight to SR.

				After trying various methods coinbase has become my go to site for btc.... once a level two its probably the best option. You can be done with everything from buying your btc to ordering whatever floats your boat in a couple of hours.<br /><br />

Anyone have any clue on how they manage to keep their prices well below other sites such as mtgox.... even currently they&#039;re 5usd cheaper on coinbase. <br /><br />A quick turn around seems tempting if youre limited to 50 once a level two. 50x5= 250 for doing near nothing.

				Feemsteam -<br /><br />You just asked how coinbase keeps their coins $5 cheaper than COINBASE.<br /><br />Am I reading something incorrectly here?<br /><br /><br />In the end, I find that COINBASE &gt; BLOCKCHAIN.INFO &gt; SILK ROAD is a VERY safe, fast, and secure way to purchase and transfer my BTC around.&nbsp; They are tumbled two times by the time they hit the silk road so there is NO way they can trace you personal info back to them.&nbsp; Once the BTC hits BLOCKCHAIN, there is no tracing anything back.&nbsp; It&#039;s just an added layer of protection before sending to SILKROAD.<br /><br />Also, blockchain only charges 0.0005 BTC to transfer your funds out of.&nbsp; That&#039;s a hell of a deal for such great tumbling.

				I have not tested it for myself but I heard blockchain&#039;s shared send leaves quite a bit of taint in the output coins. Yes it gets routed through a shared wallet but I&#039;ve heard you get back quite a bit of the same coin you put in.

				I&#039;m very glad this thread was started. I am in the process of my first transaction using coinbase. Seems pretty easy once you get through the first transaction(which i&#039;ve yet to do). My first time I gave them my routing and account number and the night before it was supposed to go through it cancelled saying the bank didn&#039;t have that account. So I called my bank and they told me to use a special routing number used for wire transfers. They didn&#039;t know I was using coinbase, I just let them know my transfer didnt work and they told me to do that. I&#039;m now waiting for the funds to go through and my bitcoins to be purchased. PRAYING it works this time. Been very frustrated. I am also going to be tumbling my coins before transferring them to SR. Has anyone else had this problem? Thanks guys!!<br /><br />Ryno
