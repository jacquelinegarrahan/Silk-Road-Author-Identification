				(1) Electro-Motive Force, or E.M.F., is a consequence of the law of electromagnetic induction, Faraday&#039;s Law. This is his Electro-Tonic State. It is dimensionally the time rate at which magnetic induction is produced or consumed, or in other words “moved about”. The dimensional relation is given as<br /><br />Weber per Second,<br /><br />This defines E.M.F. in Volts.<br /><br />(2) The notion exists that the electro-motive force, E.M.F. in volts, is established by “cutting” lines of magnetic induction via a so called electric conductor. This “cutting” is then said to impel the motions of so called electrons within the conducting material. It is however that a perfect conductor cannot “cut” thru lines of induction, or flux lines, Phi. Heaviside points out that the perfect conductor is a perfect obstructor and magnetic induction cannot gain entry into the so called conducting material. So where is the current, how then does an E.M.F. come about? Now enters the complication; it can be inferred that an electrical generator that is wound with perfect conducting material cannot produce an E.M.F. No lines of flux can be cut and the aether gets wound up in a knot. Heaviside remarks that the practitioners of His Day “do a good deal of churning up the aether in their dynamos”.<br /><br />(3) A good analogy exists between the induction generator, and its hydraulic counterpart, the centrifugal pump. The pump casing is filled with water in order to operate. Once filled with water, in the condition that the suction and discharge valves are shut thereby confining water to the pump casing, the pump consumes no energy from its shaft. The pump impeller rotates with no damaging pressure, and the water and impeller rotate in step within the pump casing. Upon opening the valves the shaft is loaded by the energy required to move the water thru the pump casing. The law of energy continuity is established in that the energy consumed by the pump shaft is continued as the energy delivered to the motion of the water. Also by the law of reciprocity the energy can be extracted from the flow of water and continued as the delivery of energy to the shaft. Now the centrifugal pump is a centrifugal turbine.<br /><br />In this configuration the centrifugal apparatus is connected with an electro-dynamic machine, this an induction motor. This induction motor delivers motive energy to the centrifugal pump. It is however that the centrifugal apparatus is also capable of serving as a centrifugal turbine delivering energy to the motor shaft and hence now this induction machine is and induction generator. Again the law of energy continuity is established in that the motive energy taken from the flow of water is delivered to the shaft of the induction machine. The law of reciprocity is established in that the energy continuity is equivalent in both directions of power flow. (This is not possible with an engine) <br /><br />(4) The induction machine is in some ways analogous to the centrifugal machine. In order for the centrifugal machine to function the casing must be filled with water. Likewise, the induction machine must be filled with magnetism, this in order to function as a generator or motor, otherwise the shaft &amp; rotor spin free transferring no energy. This describes the torque converter in an automatic transmission, a fluidic clutch. As with the centrifugal machine, once it is filled with magnetism, it is that no load appears on the shaft of the induction machine when its circuit breaker is open. Only upon closing the breaker can energy be supplied to the shaft as an induction generator, or taken from the shaft as an induction motor. This analogy between the centrifugal machine and the induction machine fails in one aspect, where the body of water in the casing is moved along with the flow, the magnetism in the induction machine remains stationary and static. No magnetic energy is required beyond that necessary to fill the induction machine. Hence this magnetizing force can be maintained by an electro-static condenser.<br /><br />It is however that a large electro-magnetic energy is developed by the induction generator, taking this from the rotor shaft and its prime mover. Here the magnetic induction &amp; E.M.F. developed greatly exceeds that involved in the excitation of the induction machine. This opens the question as to where exactly does this generated electricity come from, and likewise with an induction motor where does the consumed electricity go. A sea of partial differential equations is of no assistance in finding the answer. It is occult to human kind, and the actual dimensions of electricity remain unknown. Here is where we begin.

				(1) In this series of writings the principle objective is the theoretical treatment of the magnetic amplifier as applied to synchronous parameter variation. The magnetic amplifier is a development of Ernst Alexanderson, a Swedish born engineer. Alexanderson worked directly with Steinmetz at General Electric. Here developed was the Alexanderson system of wireless transmission. This system was the only wireless development to show novelty over all of the encompassing patents of Nikola Tesla. The magnetic amplifier is an important element in the Alexanderson system of transmission.<br /><br />(2) After the fall of Nikola Tesla and Wardenclyffe in 1904, a dark age fell upon the wireless. Promotional efforts, fraud, monopolistic practices, all ensued. Names like Lee DeForest, G. Marconi were the rulers of this age. See “Empire of the Air”. A morass of interference developed from the stations of inventors and experimenters. With the onset of World War One, it became a matter of national security. The Alexanderson system was developed by 1917 and would effect greatly the course of radio history.<br /><br />(3) During the dark ages the U.S. Navy became increasing disillusioned with the wireless developments provided to them. Poor and unreliable performance along with the dependence upon civilian technicians frustrated the efforts of establishing a reliable and effective naval radio communication system. The Alexanderson system along with later developments by Edwin Howard Armstrong would mark the end of the radio dark ages. The U.S.Navy was quick to co-opt the Alexanderson system into its communication network. KET and WII were its first Alexanderson stations for V.L.F. transmission. The Navy froze all radio patents from the dark ages, ending the relentless patent wars. The assistant secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt used this opportunity to outlaw radio for civilian use, ending the radio experimenter. Under the direction of Admiral Bullard, U.S.N. A “Radio Corporation” was organized to serve as a holding company for radio patents and developments. Hence the birth of R.C.A. in 1919, and also the birth of radio as it has become known. The year 1919 begins the age of electromagnetic radio and its domination of transmission theory. But today we are interested in the unknown radio of yesterday, that before 1919, that of Tesla and Alexanderson.<br /><br />(4) The development of the thermionic vacuum tube by General Electric and Bell Telephone put this device in the forefront of radio advancements. This could never happen in the hands of the inventor, Lee DeForest, so he was bought out by A.T.T. And his patents placed into the patent pool of the Radio Corporation, developing into a monopolistic trust. The efforts of Edwin H. Armstrong for R.C.A. and Langmir for G.E. Led to the Pliotron Power Oscillator utilizing the UV-207 thermionic, water cooled, vacuum triode. This instantly obsoleted use of the Alexanderson alternator for the production of large quantities of radio frequency power. His system became obsolete almost as soon as it was installed (1921), R.C.A. Radio Central, Rocky Point, NY. Thus the Alexanderson system became a dinosaur, to be buried and then forgotten. In the American tradition it was all smashed into rubble and then thrown over the cliffs into the sea. (Bolinas). Another historic “elimination”.<br /><br />(5) Becoming obsolete, the Alexanderson system was regarded as of no significance to the “modern understanding” of electricity. As electronic ideas began to overtake electrical ideas a misunderstanding developed with regard to the electric wireless of Tesla and Alexanderson. Radio became married to electro-magnetism, and electricity became married to the electron. It is however that the Alexanderson system is electrical, not electronic. It was in fact developed specifically to avoid the electronic patents, and also work in a way not already specified in the patents of Nikola Tesla. The magnetic amplifier served as a kind of magnetic transistor, eliminating the need for the electronic vacuum triode of DeForest. The Alexanderson aerial is unlike the structures of Tesla and Marconi and also is not an electro-magnetic radiator. The developments of Ernst Alexanderson operate in a unique fasion, unlike more commonly known electrical developments. Hence the importance of the study of the elements of the Alexanderson system.<br /><br />(6) The Alexanderson system consists of three principle elements;<br /><br />I) The Variable Reluctance Alternator, for the generation of V.L.F. Power.<br /><br />II) The Magnetic Amplifier, for the modulation of this V.L.F. Power.<br /><br />III) The Multiple Loaded Aerial, for the transmission of the modulated V.L.F. Power.<br /><br />All three of these elements are based upon radical departures from more conventional electrical designs. The Law of Electromagnetic Induction finds a new meaning in these particular developments of Alexanderson. These represent a “third way” in the development of electromotive force. It can be expected that certain anomalies as well as certain oppositions by “the group” in the Law of Energy Continuity are to be found in the elements that comprise the Alexanderson system. Such is demonstrated with the Variable Reluctance Generator seen in the Borderland video, this machine similar to the Alexanderson alternator in principle.<br /><br />(7) Electro-Motive Force is brought about by magnetism in motion. The motional relationship between magnetism and its bounding metallic-dielectric geometry give rise to E.M.F., this E.M.F. as a reaction to magnetic motion is and inertial force, at least as it is commonly understood. The production or consumption of electro-motive force is developed by three distinct relations;<br /><br />I) The E.M.F. of Variable Magnetic Induction, such as with the static transformer,<br /><br />II) The E.M.F. of Motional Magnetic Induction, such as with the rotating motor-generator,<br /><br />III) The E.M.F. of Variable Magnetic Inductivity, such as the static magnetic amplifier, or rotating variable reluctance alternator.<br /><br />In basic terminology, with the static transformer it is the intensity of the magnetism is variable, in the motor-generator the position of the magnetism is variable, and in the magamp or Alexanderson alternator it is the containment of the magnetism is variable.<br /><br />In the static transformer the magnetizing force is made to vary, as with alternating current. This gives rise to a continuously variable quantity of magnetic induction developing a continuously variable E.M.F. Induction is the variable.<br /><br />In the motor-generator the position of the magnetic induction is made to vary via rotation. This rotation is constant developing an E.M.F. which is also constant and constantly rotating as is the magnetism. Here the E.M.F. is not alternating as with the static transformer, but has a vector of constant length in constant rotation. Hence this E.M.F. is in a polyphase or direct current relation. Orientation in Space is the variable.<br /><br />In the magnetic amplifier, or Alexanderson alternator, the inductivity of the medium supporting the magnetic induction is made to vary, this by saturation or relative motion. Hereby magnetism is made to enter or leave the magnetic medium thru the variation of the storage capability of that medium. The E.M.F. developed is in order to facilitate the flow of magnetic energy into, or out of, the medium of variable magnetic inductivity. Storage Capability is the variable. This is the “third way”.

				Confusion seems to exist as to the nature of N Tesla&#039;s radiant matter efforts. This subject was of great importance to Tesla. All understanding here originates with the ideas of Sir W. Crookes, the inventor of the vacuum tube and thereby the grand uncle of atomic physics. Here is where to start, Crookes. What was Tesla&#039;s radiant matter anyway? Rest assured those who talk the most on this subject are the ones that know the least, a fundamental of human behavior. What is claimed to be Tesla is often rather the opposite. Presently, because of the efforts of certain individuals with engineering background, the established pseudo-Tesla mythos is dissolving. For those forces that despise Tesla, some with a pathological fervor, this requires a damage control operation on their part. Hence it can be expected, since the Bearden-Bedini axis has become QRU, a new much more advanced for of dis-info regarding Tesla may come about. <br /><br />Tesla&#039;s radiant matter is NOT composed of electrons, protons, or quarks. These are but mathematical abstractions. The starting point is the pre-Einstein work done in studying the Roentgen Ray and the phenomenon of the anode and cathode. (E.P. Thompson has a book on this . Vassilatos has several writings on Crookes.) Tesla&#039;s radiant matter would be in the form of &quot;Le Sage&quot; particles, or &quot;Thompson Corpuscles&quot;, and components of the nucleus Mendelev pre-hydrogen aether gasses.<br /><br />Tesla exposed himself to massive intensities of his radiant output. From the electron volt standpoint he should of died a few weeks after these experiments. But he did not, why? <br /><br />Tesla utilized direct rays, these from a single element vacuum tube fed by a source of mono-polar electro static potential. This much like radiation from the sun, this is what Tesla was after, a sun in a bottle, lookout Edison! Today the X-Ray is derived from a reflected, not directed, source of radiation.<br /><br />Rather than rays we now have radiation. This is analogous to the primary induction from the sun producing visible light, or radiation, upon its impact with matter. Today the X-Ray tube has a heavy metal (Tungsten) anode. Rays from a thermionic (DC) cathode strike this anode, or target, giving rise to reflected photonic radiations that have been given the name X-Rays. Of course these &quot;Einstein Rays&quot; are destructive to living organisms, but the &quot;Tesla Rays&#039; are not. This is something to think about.

				The dielectric field exists as a conjugate relation to the magnetic field. Like the magnetic field it can be expressed is self inductive and mutual inductive components, these in a space vs counter space and space quadrature existence. Here given is the self capacitance and a mutual elastance. In general the self capacitance is outside of the winding space, and the mutual elastance is inside the winding space. As with magnetism here is a space versor.<br /><br />It is postulated that dielectricity is a tension in the Aether. Again it seems to defy notions of space, such as if a line of force has no broken end in space then how can it propogate? It cannot propogate if it did not already exist. Another bottomless pit. Associated with this tension is a displacement current, a notion of Maxwell, but it is like EMF, it is an idea. Relating dielectricity as a tension, e, in volts expresses its force. The total quantity of dielectricity is again considered to be the total number of lines of force, Psi. What lines of force.<br /><br />The trap is the same as that encountered with mangetism. J.J. Thompson seems to think there are 1000 of these lines of force terminating upon todays electron. The electron hence contains 1000 Thompson Aether corpuscles. Heretical! Here the quantity of dielectric induction in lines of force is given in Ampere-seconds and this established their number as the &quot;dielectric charge&quot; just as the Volt-secind defined &quot;magnetic charge&quot;.<br /><br />Self capacitance is in a counter-spatial relation with mutual elastance. The two are space conjugates. Here defined is each,<br /><br />1) Self Capacitance, C, Farad<br />2) Mutual Enductance, K, per Farad<br /><br />C represents space and K represents counter space. K is a form of &quot;dielectric inductance&quot; but not in the same way as L &amp; M. Complications exist here in description since magnetism is intrinsically spatial and dielectricity is instrinsically counter spatial. It is not so easy to just &quot;step through the looking glass&quot;. <br /><br />The two quantities are reciprocal relations, one is the inverse of the other, again, until differentiated. <br /><br />The dimensions of C are one over c square (the &quot;hand&quot; on the monochord). This is thus second square over centimeter square and hence the dimensions of K are c square or centimeter square over second square. The dimensional operator or first order derivative is the dimension of per centimeter. Hereby dimensionally for distributed constants, the distributed capacitance is Farad per centimeter or second square per centimeter cubed, and the distributed elastance is per Farad per centimeter or centimeter per second square. Denoting now, as with the magnetic component, the distributed capacity as C and the distributed elastivity as K, the travelling wave of dielectric induction in the metrical dimension of space is CK or per centimeter square. This is a second order space differential. This gives a hyperbolic function with respect to distance along the propogating structure. The square root of the product of distributed constants, CK, is the hyperbolic angle, or propogation constant, Nepers per centimeter.<br /><br />Considering now both fields of induction, the magnetic and the dielectric, there exists a pair of propogation constants, the square root of LM, the magnetic propogation, and the square root of CK, the dielectric propogation. Both distributions are a hyperbolic function of distance but now cannot properly be called single energy. Both the magnetic and dielectric propogations are time scalar, no time delay exists but the distribution in space is instantaneous. It may be postulated that the mutual magnetic and mutual dielectric components L and K are not affected by metallic obstruction but now the metallic is rather a conduction through its counter spatial dimensions.

				Previously defined are four dinstinct electric types of inductivities:<br /><br />1) Self inductivity, L, in Henry per centimeter<br />2) Self capacity, C, in Farad per centimeter<br />3) Mutual enductivity, M, in per Henry per centimeter<br />4) Mutual elastivity, K, in per Farad per centimeter<br /><br />The dimension relations are given as:<br />1) L, centimeter<br />2) C, second square centimeter cube<br />3) M, per centimeter cube<br />4) K, centimeter per second square<br /><br />These are the distributed constants of the generalized field of electric induction. The two distributions in space are defined by:<br /><br />1) LM, per centimeter square<br />2) CK, per centimeter square<br /><br />Dimensionally standing between LM and CK is the dimensions of second square. This is to say that the magnetic distribution and the dielectric distribution are interwoven through the dimension of time and its relation frequency. This is not unlike a simple condenser and reactance coil which interect through per second square. Now the two fields are not lumped, but are distributed in form. Hence the time dimensional interactions between LM and CK gives rise to a complex of electric wave propogations in both spatial and counter spatial modes.<br /><br />Here we meet with the completely generalized electric wave. We are nearing the holy grail of electrical engineering.<br /><br />The complex of magneto-dielectric interactions can take four distinct forms. Each is a single magnetic energy interacting through time with a single dielectric energy. Hence:<br /><br />1) LC, Henry-Farad per centimeter square<br />2) MK, per Henry-per Farad per centimeter square<br /><br />In dimensional expression these are given as,<br />LC, second square per centimeter square<br />MK, second square times centimeter square<br /><br />These two terms give rise to a pair of propogation constants,<br />One over the square root of LC,<br />1) centimeters per second<br /><br />One over the square root of MK,<br />2) per centimeter per second<br /><br />Relation (1) is a velocity, motion through space over time, and relation (2) is a counter velocity, motion through counter space over time. These two propogation constants represent the motion of electric induction in a general metallic-dielectric geometry. Unlike the distributions LM and CK which are hyperbolic functions of distance, the propogations LC, and MK, are circular functions of distance along the propogating structure. It can be said two hyperbola are transformed into two circles, this as a geometric analog.<br /><br />Two additional interactions between magnetic and dielectric inductions arise,<br />3) K/L, per second square<br />4) M/C, per second square<br /><br />or alternatively <br />3) L/K, second square<br />4) C/M, second square<br /><br />A reciprocal relation suggests itself here such as <br />3) L/K per second square<br />4) C/M second square<br /><br />In all their forms both L over K and M over C are space scalars in that they exhibit no distribution in space, everywhere at the same time. Relations (3) and (4) are space-scalar frequencies of magnetic-dielectric exchange and accordingly they are circular functions of time.<br /><br />Through the presented dimensional relations a generalized expression for electric induction is established. It consists of the following components,<br /><br />1) The space distribution of magnetic induction, LM,<br />2) The space distribution of dielectric induction, CK, <br />3) The time rate of energy exchange between self inductivity, L, and mutual elastivity, K,<br />4) The time rate of energy exchange between self capacity, C, and mutual enductivity, M<br /><br />And these four factors, or constants give rise to a pair of electric wave propagations,<br /><br />a) The electromagnetic propogation in space, LC,<br />b) The magneto dielectric propogation in counterspace MK<br /><br />Here four scalar constants, two time scalar, two space scalar, give rise to a pair of waves in two conjugate dimensional relations. This is a bit more complex than a single lumped condenser, or a single lumped reactor. In fact in view of this more generalized understanding the condenser is in actuality a mutual elastor, K, and the reactor is in actuality a mutual enductor, M. Here is a completely reversed viewpoint.

				I agree. I have been a networking engineer my entire adult life. My company has been contracted by everyone from F500 companies to the Fed. I would love to be able to post what advice I can give... but this 50ct post reply crap is killing me. The best I can do at the moment is lurk. I have been luring for months, I guess I should have participated more then...
