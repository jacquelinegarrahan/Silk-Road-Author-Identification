				Ok im in need of sum help/advice regarding an order i placed. So last week on 7/16 i placed an order for .1 of sum black tar from a reputable vendor(has 100% rating been around for several months and have only seen positive feedback about him on his feedback and on this forum) So on 7/18 my order was marked in transit and sent priority USA,so i say GREAT! Priority 99% of the time gets here within 2-3 days from point a to point b domestically! So thurs turns into fri turns into sat(no mail on sunday)and sun turns to mon. So on monday morning i head down to the mailbox,im stayin at a friends apartment) and im anticipating in my package and nothing but junk mail. Started feeling dissapointed but then reminded myself that in all liklihood this vendor who is reputable,is sending this from the westcoast and im on the eastcoast and BTH is non-existent in this part of the country.Plus, i&#039;m fully aware that shipping with USPS is not an exact science and 2-3 with priority mail isnt guarenteed plus humans make errors. so on monday i contact vendor and he said it has absolutely been sent.So tuesday which was yesterday im excited thinkin it got to be there and still nothing. so i contacted the vendor again and just as before he responded within a few hours. i basically asked him if he could give me a gist with where the package is but for both of our security didnt ask for the tracking info. he politely indicated that basically i had either not requested upon making the order/priority mail no longer gives tracking info BUT ASSURED ME IT WILL ARRIVE and i believe him. so today,wEDNESDAY, IM EXCITEd and waited until 12pm which is an hour after the mail has usually been dropped off and...nothing! So its like fuck on one hand this vendor is legit and absoutely believe he has sent this and sent it using vacumming sealing etc...but on the other hand it will be tommorow, a week since it has been in transit.Now my reason for providing this long post is so that anyone who looks at this has every minute detail so that they can better assist me.I have never in the 35+ transactions using priority mail 99% of the time have had such a delay? Even when i dealt with a vendor previously who had falsely marked it in transit and then a couple of days later sent it out have i had such a long waiting time. and what boggles my mind the most is im 99.9% sure that things are legit with the vendor so now my mind is racing with thoughts of was the package intercepted/being held cuz sumthing was discovered? at this point its not so much as to the money/product but much much more so as to security. So i need advice and my specific ? are:is it unheard of for priority to take a week? if sumhow it was intercepted how do i kno/when will i kno and by what method? what measures do i take if that is the case? I so want to call USPS and find out but im absolutely restraining myself because ive heard that if you deny that you were ever sent a package if they ask you and say i dont kno who sent that but it is not mine so just send it back to the sender or whatever you will be fine cuz anybody can send anybody anything...I realize this is such a small amount of BTH,.1 to be exact, but im concerned/nervous because i have never dealt with this long of a shipping time with priority for domestic for anything i have ever ordered online,not just including SR.Hey i realize there gonna be people who respond to this and be like &quot;chill the fuck out,your overreacting&quot; or &quot;your an idiot&quot; well thats fine...just after you laugh at me or whatever answer my ?.Cuz ive just never experienced this.their is the possibility cuz its an apartment complexx and the mailboxes are not residential size that it wouldnt fit...but im not buying that cuz me and my dude order shit all the time from SR and the mailbox size has never been an issue,ever! ok, apologies in advance for this being xtremely long BUT IM DAMN SURE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE IVE DONE EVErything within my power to protect myself and my friend...and asking the SR community is my best bet!.....THANX

				plz learn to use a line break. i only skimmed over that block of text, but have the general idea what you&#039;re asking.<br /><br />ask the vendor if the package has traking and could check it for you. I&#039;ve had priority take 17 days once, no clue why. Watched the tracking show it going back and forth between two sorting centers half a dozen times. probably the only time i can remember priority taking more than 3-4 days, but it does happen.

				2. if it&#039;s confiscated, i don&#039;t see the DEA busting down your door for $20 of h. it&#039;s not impossible, but it would be pretty embarrassing to the police department if there was some newspaper article where they wasted $1,000s of taxpayer dollars to raid someone for only 1/10th of a gram.

				in my experience (power seller on ebay over 10,000 transactions) priority mail is 2-3 days 90-95 percent of the time.... i would say 2 percent were beyond 5 days <br /><br /><br />Now take in mind he could drop it off at 530 on tuesday, which is after their processing time thus its as if it were sent out wed -- losing a day. Still a week is pushing it but i have seen it take 7-10 days before. Normally though this is alaska or real random areas of the country. But it just depends. <br /><br />Also it could be an issue that you shipped to your friends place in your name.... just depends how confused your mailman is. he may return it without consulting you. <br /><br />Anytime i use a fake name -- i generally send 2-3 normal letters that way the mailman who sees your shit every day doesnt think anything of it. Just depends on the inconsistency of usps i guess<br /><br /><br />best

				Point well taken guys! I actually did ask the vendor for the tracking info but he said that HE personally requires customers to ask for it in advance,otherwise they ship it without! I recently saw sumthing regarding USPS changing things up with priority and the tracking info sumwhere but im not sure exactly what it entailed?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding the name and address, i used my friends name and spelled it properly and DEF gave the right address,cuz i was looking at his address from mail that he got that day and had my undivided attention on the correct spelling,address,zip, etc... so there def isnt a problem with the mailman being confused!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But as macaroni mentioned he had a domestic priority package take 17 days for no real rhyme or reason and the person who posted last said they had a priority package take like a week or so! and more importantly,what has helped calm me down a tad bit more is that if it was intercepted and they were gonna bust my ass, it would be in the paper that the cops had spent 1,000&#039;s of dollars and manpower to take sumone down for .1,especially since Im very close in proximity to a major city! in fact where im at it actually is part the city,a nicer area of the city, but you drive 15-20 min down further your in the hood, where people die and are killed almost every day!!! So thanx and kudos to your clear headed logic!!!! :) :)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Watch after me posting this, 2morrow it will be right in the mailbox safe and sound and the moment will be bittersuite. Suite cuz ill be flying high again like that ozzy song but bitter cuz i will have wasted a whole entire day freakin out!&nbsp; &nbsp; This def cant be the vendors fault you dont maintain a 100% rating for 4 or 5 months and have 200-300 sales and be anything other than a legit buisnessman so im not going to msg him until the resolve option becomes available cuz he doesnt control the mail and if was being bombarded by msg id be fuckin pissed off!!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But im very appreciative of your advice and now im not nervous/freakin out. Disappointed,yes but not flippin the fuck out! i thank you guys very much.....If anybody else has any other advice/tips,im absolutely all ears. THANX AGAIN GUYS<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Why do people freak out over user quantities of drugs taking any more time than necessary?&nbsp; Oh!, because they&#039;re using...&nbsp; Worst case scenario you get a note that says you don&#039;t get your drugs.&nbsp; I start to worry when something is awry with larger shipments.&nbsp; Otherwise it&#039;s all good and only time will tell. <br /><br />No reason to get worked up over something that will be resolved regardless of your involvement.&nbsp; It gets there when it gets there.

				in response to usedcondombyHivmen comment about people freaking out about their packages not arriving during an expected time.Well as i had indicated in the 1st post it was not so much at this juncture recieving said product but rather protecting myself legally if it been confiscated. and seeing that this isnt my residence, i was simply asking so that i could protect myself and my friend if feds happend to have intercepted it...but dont i kno you from sumwhere cuz you somehow seemed to have the opinion that i&#039;m into using habitually? oh yea, i remember we used to go horseback riding and if my memory serves me correctly i rode the standard horse and...yea you rode the one that was real big and high but after 90 min i would dismount but yet you would not get off your high horse! Yea we used to discuss buisness as well. i do remember we had a disagreement in regards to what was prudent in terms of what the proprietor of a buisness should do if a customer was in need of assistance. Remember when i had stated that because the customers ultimately keep the owner in buisness regardless of the CEO net worth and additionally stated that if enough customers were not pleased the CEO net worth would inevitably go down. I remember your rebuttal to this was that well if the consumers didnt like the taste of fecal matter on their palate,well by god they would learn to love it.......Dude,you don&#039;t kno me and you cant see me! but the very little bit i know about you is that you offer zero help. How would you like it if when you fucking dudes in the ass and your condom broke and had been relying on Trojan to ship out your petite size condoms that you had paid your good money from working the night shift at the gay bar and when calling customer service they told you your package would get there when it got there and you were now forced to have anal sex and catch all sorts of bacterial infections from the poop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY YOU COCKSUCKER THIS HAS BEEN STRESSING ME THE FUCK OUT!!!! TELL YA WHAT YA CUM GUZZLING QUEEN, ILL BECOME A VENDOR ON SR AND START SELLING MY CUM AND LET YOU PLACE AN ORDER AT 90% OFF FOR YOU AND THEN WHEN YOUR GOIN THRU WITHDRAW FROM LACK OF COCK AND ASK FOR MY HELP ILL JUST TELL YA IT&#039;LL GET THERE WHEN IT GETS THERE!...WELCOME TO THE OWN ZONE, POPULATION:YOU
