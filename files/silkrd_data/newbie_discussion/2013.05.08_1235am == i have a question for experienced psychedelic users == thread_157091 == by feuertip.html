				there are 5 psychedelic stages and supposedly you can go to the very top with just enough magic mushrooms even beyond lsd and dmt.<br /><br />is there someone who has taken large amounts of mushrooms and who can compare them to lsd dmt and/or mescalin?<br />at best someone who actually tried to get to the very top with shrooms. once i took enough for good open eye visuals and a 1hour out-of-body experience. i looked into an empty corner on the ceiling and then i was sucked into it and it morphed into an infinite triangular tunnel and i was flying very fast just above the ground and then the tunnel&nbsp; started to be shaped like the best rollercoaster ever or to be more precise like an awesome trackmania track back then i was 15 to 17 and just ate about 1.25 gramm and was tripping this hard. last spring i started with 0.5g/ about one 56th oz and every couple of weeks i raised the dose to 2.5 g in the end and just had close eye visuals and was heavily laughing. but thats not the problem. the question is with enough shrooms can i trip as hard as on lsd dmt and/or mescalin? that would be awesome i really want the experience but if possible without using anything but magic mushrooms<br /><br />i really hope someone knows what im talking about<br /><br />

				You have never just ate an 1/8th or 1/4 of shrooms? In my experience, that is pretty equivalent to 1 hit of super bomb or 1-3 of decent LSD... Hope this helps.

				You are talking about what they call a &quot;Level 5&quot; trip, described as a &quot;Total loss of visual connection with reality. The senses cease to function in the normal way. Total loss of ego. Merging with space, other objects, or the universe. The loss of reality becomes so severe that it defies explanation. The earlier levels are relatively easy to explain in terms of measurable changes in perception and thought patterns. This level is different in that the actual universe within which things are normally perceived, ceases to exist! Satorienlightenment (and other such labels).&quot;<br /><br />Assuming you are eating&nbsp; psilocybe cubensis that haven&#039;t been sitting around for months, I would say six or seven grams should do the trick depending your personal tolerance.&nbsp; (If you are eating old shrooms it may take a considerable amount more.)&nbsp; &nbsp;If that&#039;s not intense enough, up the dose by a gram the next time.&nbsp; Just remember that once you are an hour and a half or so into your trip, eating more won&#039;t do much good.&nbsp; you will just be wasting shrooms.

				I have consumed unmeasured, extremely fresh amounts of mushrooms (species unknown) on the order of a handful. And yes that works well. Level 5? I don&#039;t think so.<br /><br />Shrooms are a great starter. But you should try other psychedelics after a while. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				The family apparently calls level 5 trips &quot;stealing your face&quot;. Which I think accurately describes anyone I&#039;ve met to have gone through that experience: They&#039;ve gone to the other side and haven&#039;t quite made it all the way back. <br /><br />Side note: The family scares the shit out of me... So glad I found SR so I no longer have to deal with anyone even remotely connected to those psychos. At least not in person anyway.

				Yep about 6 grams or more should get you to level 5.<br /><br />However the shrooms experience is very different than LSD for me. Shrooms are gentle and allow you to control how easily you enter Netherworld. LSD just simply puts you there regardless of how you think or feel.<br /><br />That&#039;s how I explain it, it&#039;s very subjective and different for everyone.<br /><br />Have fun...

				One of the distinct characteristics of a level 5 trip is something called Satori Enlightenment or some great understanding is achieved (not some dumb &quot;i found the meaning of life&quot; nonsense) . I experienced this once on only 2.5 grams of shrooms (they were the strongest ive had so far) It was craaaazy. I dont know how to explain it beyond this: I came to understanding myself, then I felt connected to everything and everyone, like everything no matter how small has some sort of significance in life, and I felt as though i had bonded on some level with the cosmos/universe. It was pretty cool, never really experienced anything close to that ever since, even on acid.
