				I was looking for some 4-HO-MET, etc. or 5-XXX etc and am having a hard time finding a decent supply without paying a ridiculous markup or huge shipping cost from overseas. If anyone knows where to get these please let me know. Thanks!

Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just by the nature of a low demand its why the supply isnt as consistent and trust me I feel you though because I&#039;m into experimenting with RC&quot;s myself. But look around, you&#039;ll be able to find some reasonable listings from some good vendors, and even though the shipping may run ya a lil expensive from overseas its not that much of a risk ordering since most RC&#039;s are in blotter or liquid/powder form which if buying from a vendor with excellent stealth you shouldnt have any issues. And as for the price, it comes with the territory. We&#039;re able to order basically any drug we want with a few clicks, all at our fingertips. To me, its a small price to pay for the freedom of choice.

				I don&#039;t see much use in RCs on the road. especially not for Europe as there&#039;s a bunch of reputable vendors who can supply a large variety of RCs all together. Also since it&#039;s still legal in lots of countries, why use the road for this :)

I&#039;d rather pay a little extra and get it from a vendor here on the road who has multiple reviews and is staking their rep on the quality/consistency of their goods. I could order from some big RC company, but what recourse do I have if they fuck me over? Also, I want for personal use and a gram of 4-HO-MET is way too much product for my friends and I to ever consume. I&#039;m not looking to start a business, I&#039;m just looking to have a good time&nbsp; :o<br />It just seems to me that if someone where to enter this space and sell pills/small quantities at a reasonable markup there might be some money to be made.
