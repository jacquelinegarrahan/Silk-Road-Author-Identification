				I got a note left by usps in the mail stating that I have to come sign for&nbsp; certified mail.&nbsp; This mail is a package from sr.&nbsp; Vendor says this is probably to do with him not paying enough for postage.&nbsp; I&#039;m worried this is a set up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any input?

				I&#039;d check with vendor first if everything checks out with him sounds like a trap, then I guess plausible deniability.

				I&#039;m sure someone more experienced than I could answer this better, but this is how I would handle. <br /><br />If the vendor is certain that he didn&#039;t use enough postage, then I wouldn&#039;t worry and go get it, and then I&#039;d leave him a 1/5 and NEVER order from him again as there is no reason for that non-sense. Concurrently if he verifies that he did in fact use &quot;Certified Mail&quot; then the mail man is required to obtain a signature. Hence why they use this service when you are being served a court supeona.<br /><br />If he did use enough postage (as he should have of course) and he didn&#039;t use actual &quot;Certified Mail&quot; (most mail is not certified by the way, they charge extra for the service) then you should be concerned and I personally wouldn&#039;t go pick it up.<br /><br />But just my opinion so I would seek more advice before you make a move.

				I don&#039;t know if SWIMming is allowed so let&#039;s just say I know a U.S. Attorney intimately and just because you sign for a package does NOT mean you know what&#039;s in it. <br /><br />So feel free to pick it up. Just say you don&#039;t know what&#039;s in it if anyone ever asks. They can never prove you knowingly possessed anything.

				Ya, confirm whats up with the vendor. If he fucked up somehow and made it so you havta sign, then , well, it&#039;s your choice. I&#039;d go get it, in fact, I&#039;ve had this same issue where the vendor fucked up and I got it. I was nervous but WTF, I just did it. I&#039;m not saying you should though, it<br />&#039;s YOUR life and YOUR decision.

				Just sign for it. It just looks like an eBay package to the average mailcarrier and if, god forbid, LE gets involved, you don&#039;t know anything about the contents. Anyone can send anyone anything.<br /><br />Not signing is just as or more suspicious than signing, it leaves drugs in the possession of USPS (or whoever), and you lost a bunch of money/drugs.
