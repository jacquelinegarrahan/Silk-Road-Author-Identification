				I hope to fuck that you at least leave a couple eggs so the race doesn&#039;t go extinct. I can tolerate a bunch of BS but abuse of animals and aiding the extinction is a breed is something I refuse to except. You Sir have pissed me off now. Good day, and burn in hell for making turtles go extinct. Even the people on the YNC would agree, kidnap all the human babies you want, but leave the innocent animals alone.<br /><br />You struck a quiet the nerve with me boi-o. GOOD DAY!

				&nbsp;I repent my prior comment. I jumped the gun and got pissed off. I guess it&#039;s alright so long as some are being raised. How much you wana bet it&#039;s them damn Asians eating all them. Still, I like turtles and it would be cool to raise some. Alas It is to big a responsibility for me.

				No, I&#039;m NOT interested. Ever wonder WHY you find them on the beach? BECAUSE SOME MOTHER TURTLE LAID THEM THERE TO HATCH AND PROPAGATE THE SPECIES!!<br /><br />Leave the turtles alone for fuck sakes. It&#039;s hard enough for them to get to the water with all the other predators and Asian people out there trying to pluck their eyeballs out and eat their ground up penises.<br />&nbsp;Find some weed or something else to satisfy your entrepreneurial spirit. Better yet, find some of that good South American coke. Then you might generate some interest.<br /><br /><br /><br />
