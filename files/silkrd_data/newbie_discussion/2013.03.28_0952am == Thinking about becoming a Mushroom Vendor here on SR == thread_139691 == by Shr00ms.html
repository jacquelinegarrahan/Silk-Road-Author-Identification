				Greetings fellow newbies and old timers&nbsp; ;D<br />I&#039;m thinking of becoming a mushroom vendor here on SR. <br />Cause there aren&#039;t many vendors and the price&#039;s aren&#039;t that cheap.<br /><br />I could offer these mushrooms @ 11eur&nbsp; 1g (mby +1eur for postage)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; % PSILOCYBIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % PSILOCIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % BAEOCYSTIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- from erowid.org<br />P. semilanceata&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.98&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.36<br />P. cubensis (Penis envy)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.025<br /><br />I would be sending them from EU.<br />Would it be worth it? All mushrooms are dried up and ready to eat be eaten&nbsp; ;)

				Hi and welcome.<br />EU shroom market is unstable, sometimes it&#039;s filled with nice offers and sometimes it&#039;s dry. So your business depends on the current market conditions. But generally it&#039;s not very competitive.<br />The fact that you have some relatively rare strains will help, although 11euro/g is a bit pricey imo. But if you give options for lower prices on higher quantities I believe you ll get many sales.<br />Usual prices on 5-10g listings for simple cubensis are at 5-6 euros/g but currently most of the vendors are sold out.<br /><br />I suppose you also have plenty in stock to make this plan viable, in that case if you find hard to get first sales consider giving out cheap samples to get some feedback. Not necessary but a good method if you find your business stuck at the beginning.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				Also, storing dried shrooms in the freezer offers about 6 mo of potency. Just like all our frozen foods, things get frost bitten--freezer burnt--which is why even frozen foods have freezer lives. (Info for the n00bs, not OP.)<br /><br />I would say it&#039;s a stable-enough-market to post up product and see what you get. Free Samples are awesome, but as previous post indicates--not essential. Good drugs sell themselves. Noobs on here everyday are all willing to try new stuff....

				I would go for it.... cant have enough shrooms around ya know....<br /><br />I really like the penis envy strain... another mushroom vendor&nbsp; has had these for purchase... seems like they sell out pretty quick.... also I think the strain produces a mutant in the first flushes.&nbsp; These are considered more potent than the regular flushes....<br /><br />I got a 7 gram Mutant and I kid you not it looked like a giant EYE staring back at me.....<br /><br />I ate that EYE and then proceeded to knock up some pint jars that are now ready for birthing.....<br /><br />awwww.... love the miracle of birth.
