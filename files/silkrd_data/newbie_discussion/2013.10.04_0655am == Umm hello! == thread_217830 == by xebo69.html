				I don&#039;t know if any of you know me but i wanted to say that i am gonna make a vendor site, this might sound stupid and yeah but, I have a idea, and it might work out. I have been on SR for about 1 and a half years, wasn&#039;t a vendor but i was a buyer, under the name 4thdez. And I was also wondering if anyone has contact with the guy who sells the El Dorado THC pills, I was gonna buy some but i came on and saw all this, also with the guy who was at the top of the weed selection that would sell 7gs with different choices. And maybe a person who sells the vaporizer pens with the concentrate. But, I think I should have been more active on the forums because I sound like a nub and probably look stupid especially since I&#039;m posting after this whole situation happened. But I&#039;m gonna build a new website, and everything it will have escrow. I guarantee it will be the best, honestly I&#039;ve been doing some ops and I think I can really prove myself with this one. I&#039;m pretty certain you all think this is stupid and I&#039;m fake but I will be active on here a bit because I would like to gain support, I&#039;m not asking for any donations until I actually have it running legitly for 6 months or more. Thank you to everyone my emails xebo69@torbox3uiot6wchz.onion and send me any things or ideas you think I should have on there.
