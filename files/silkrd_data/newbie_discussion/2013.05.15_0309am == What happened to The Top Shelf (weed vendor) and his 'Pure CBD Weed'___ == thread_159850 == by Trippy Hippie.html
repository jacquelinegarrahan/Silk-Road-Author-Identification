				Just wondering if anyone knows what happened to the vendor &#039;The Top Shelf&#039;?? I was a fan of his, but when I clicked the link on my home page, it went to a box to send him a message instead of his vendor page. Then I tried to click on an item of his that I had bookmarked (the &#039;Pure CBD Weed&#039;) and it indicated that the item was no longer listed....<br /><br />It&#039;s looking like his account has been deleted. Does anyone know what happened?? Or if he&#039;ll be back? Or, at least, does he have a thread where I could read something about it?<br /><br />I was hoping to order that Pure CBD Weed (advertised at 18% CBD content) for my dad because he only smokes for pain relief from chronic back pain, so I think he&#039;d dig it. (He in fact was telling me about high CBD weed developed in Israel that has strong pain relief but doesn&#039;t get you high... Looks like I found it on the road. When I saw this item earlier, The Top Shelf, indicated it was the strain (or same idea, at least) that was developed in Israel. So I got really excited, thought it would be a cool thing to surprise my pa with!) Now it looks like the item&#039;s not there anymore. So it would also help me if anyone knows of other vendors selling high CBD weed...<br /><br />Thanks a ton!
