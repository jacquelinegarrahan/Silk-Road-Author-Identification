				Hi everyone !<br /><br />I was trying to do my second order on SR and choosed a domestic vendor in order to keep it as safe as possible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my order was canceled after something like 30 hours and I lost 0.19BTC probably due do hedging.<br /><br />The vendor refused my order since it was domestical. Even though it wasn&#039;t mentioned anywhere on his page, this vendor ships worldwide EXCEPT domestically (seems a bit odd to me since it&#039;s usually the less risky option).<br /><br />I feel like I got stole 0.19BTC for an order that was fully complying to the vendor&#039;s page. It&#039;s even more annoying since these BTCs were bought 3 weeks before now when the price was at around 20.5EUR/BTC.<br /><br />What should I do ? Is it normal that you can loose quite a lot of money in canceled orders ? Anyone ever got a refund of that hedged part for canceled orders ?<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your help !

				The hedging fee for each hedged transaction is 4%. If a transaction is cancelled by a vendor that hedges their orders, SR still take the hedging fee of 4%. I think I am right in saying that unhedged orders that get cancelled don&#039;t lose any money. <br /><br />It sucks to lose the few dollars, but that is part of the T&amp;C&#039;s unfortunately. Give it a few days and the value may go up :)
