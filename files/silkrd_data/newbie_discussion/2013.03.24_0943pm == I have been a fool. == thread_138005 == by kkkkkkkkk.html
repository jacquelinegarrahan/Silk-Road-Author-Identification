				Well to make a long story short , in the search for some goods I blew a lot of money . And that is about €4500, I was real fool believing those people I should have always gone/stayed escrow as a lot of people&nbsp; tell&nbsp; all the time. Those €4500 where my life savings and atm I have no way of income and I want to sink to those people&#039;s level so rather than to scam other people I want to ask for donations. <br /><br />Which I probably don&#039;t deserve with my foolish actions, the thing of which I shame me the most of isn&#039;t that I blew the money but that is to admit that I have been scammed. I don&#039;t want/deserve the whole amount just a&nbsp; bit of it to get myself back on my feet and if i could proof it without giving away my identity I really would give&nbsp; it also I want to say this the things which i have been &quot;buying&quot; , well i don&#039;t need those items anymore my experiences have driven me away from my desire for those items so I wont blow the donations on them.<br /><br />And 3 last things <br />first: for&nbsp; &nbsp;those who find my name offensive it was just a first letter i pressed and it is easy to remember and quick to type that are the only reason for this name.<br /><br />second:For all the people who decide to donate thank you which I don&#039;t think there would be (m)any but it is worth a shot.<br /><br />third and last point: For the people who are amused with my misery I hope you enjoyed it&nbsp; &nbsp;and that would be 0.010 btc.<br /><br />BTC adress 182bzUMqvXYkDod6SXL9bGRUh2Ec1c7ybE<br />I have nothing to loose because i already did, so a good day to you all.<br /><br /><br />
