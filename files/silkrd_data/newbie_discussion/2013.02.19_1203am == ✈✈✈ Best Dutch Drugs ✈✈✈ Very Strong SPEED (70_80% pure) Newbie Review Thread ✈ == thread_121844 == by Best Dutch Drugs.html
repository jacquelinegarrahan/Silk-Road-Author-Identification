				Hi and welcome,<br /><br />This is the NEWBIE review thread of Best Dutch Drugs and this specific review thread is for our UNMIXED SPEED / METHAMPETHAMINE (or the Dutch call it PEP). <br /><br />Once our current unmixed speed stock is empty we always want to restock with the same quality, but there might be times that the quality will be slightly higher or lower. Therefore the title is called 70 to 80% pure. We are positive that we can restock our speed of at least 70% pure and max. 80% pure. We always want to be honest and upfront with our products. Future reviews of all UNMIXED speed can be placed here. :D<br /><br />If you have more then 50 posts post your review here, in the normal review thread located in rumor mill: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121834.0<br /><br /><br />About us.<br /><br />We are a new vendor ready to satisfy every customer with the highest quality Dutch drugs, we never sell inferior products if we can get that as well. For example when we can get our hands on two different types of pills, one which is cheaper and contains less mdma or we are less excited about it, we won&#039;t sell it, only the higher quality ones.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Since we are new we figured we would also make a review thread, because we really need some reviews to get things going. :)<br /><br />Currently we sell:<br /><br />✈ Very strong unmixed speed (~75/80% pure)<br />✈ Purple Partyflock XTC pills. (210/220mg MDMA)<br /><br /><br /><br />In the future we want to expand this to all the drugs we&#039;ve used ourselves, which don&#039;t harm you that much when used in moderation. Just like alcohol and smoking. ;)<br /><br />Whether you&#039;ve ordered a 1gr review sample from us or more, our very strong speed or the strong speed, we want to know if you liked it! Trip reports are also welcome.<br /><br />Also feel free to judge on us shipping times/communication and everything else. Constructive criticism is also appreciated, it improves our business. But keep in mind that we are a new vendor and we are currently very busy with starting out, our processes will get even more smooth and streamlined in the future!<br /><br /><br />Want to check out our product listings? Here you go:<br /><br />Link 5gr Very Strong Speed: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3b2fd21d6d<br />Link 5x PartyFlock XTC: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/acdc17c7ab

				Why flame our products when you haven&#039;t even tried them yourself? Please, go ahead and order a review copy here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cef5af39cf<br /><br />The REVIEWS are meant for proof...<br /><br />I&#039;ll elaborate a bit more since you clearly didn&#039;t understand. We have two listings of speed, one which is 100% unmixed and can be UP TO 80% Pure. Yes it is advertised as UP TO 80% to attract views and attention (why not?), and the pureness may vary between 75 and 80%. The test results from our cook revealed that it&#039;s around 76% and sometimes even 80% but not always. Anyhow it&#039;s still one of the highest percentages on the road. We&#039;ve never experienced stronger shit before, and the fact of the matter is it WILL keep you awake for a very long time.<br /><br />Then we also have mixed speed which is between 50 and 60% pure. (update: HAD, we don&#039;t anymore)&nbsp; FYI we only sniff the 50/60% pure listing ourselves, because we think the up to 80% pure speed is to heavy. This is also clearly stated on the product listings. Don&#039;t just take our word for it, I just noticed someone else posted this in Buyers Review on Speed/Amphetamine Vendors esp.Quality thread:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4750.msg863086#msg863086">Quote from: remoulade on February 27, 2013, 12:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just to update on BDD... I had my last bump at around 15:00 yesterday, but was up all night, eventually crashing this afternoon at 16:00. It was very pleasant overall, but would rather not have been up all night on a Monday! I&#039;d say I peaked at around 20:00 to 21:00, then plateaued until the early hours. <br /><br />I should probably add that I ate a handful of etizolam at midnight, about 5mg, but this just made me a bit wobbly and didn&#039;t help me sleep. I didn&#039;t take a lot of this speed at all, so I&#039;m very confused to be honest. Maybe this is just really clean speed? It just didn&#039;t feel like any phet I&#039;ve come across before.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />We want our customers to be safe, and that&#039;s why chose to mix it ourselves.. (update: not anymore, we only sell our pure listing now) and we are honest about it, just like we want to be honest about everything else we offer. <br /><br />We are not like the average new vendor you are portraying us to be, in fact, we want to be different and therefore honest. We are not like your average shady drug dealer, which is only concerned about money. We are normal hard working people too.<br /><br />You can argue all you want about purity and your distrust about vendors not living up to their promises but the fact of the matter is that our customers won&#039;t regret this speed, and you neither when you would actually try it. So please don&#039;t be ignorant and try it out, and judge us afterwards. The customers that tried it out, have to right to judge it, not you.<br /><br />Your comparison makess no sense at all. When you get your drivers license and you want to become a F1 driver it takes practice. When we purchase speed from our cook (which is already really good at what he does, been doing it for 30+ years) why can&#039;t it be one of the best products already out there? It&#039;s the reason why we started selling here because we felt like we could provide even better products, which might just be one of the best on SR. Why is that so strange? You are dutch yourself and participating here, so you should know that Dutch products are one of the best of the world.<br /><br />Time will tell if our products are worthwhile, it&#039;s not for you to decide when you haven&#039;t even tried it.<br /><br /><br />Update: We listen to our customers and we decided to stop selling our MIXED speed. If you want to know why, then please read proceed reading this thread. This doesn&#039;t apply to the speed for which this review thread is about, our PURE unmixed speed.

Otherwise you would have placed the proof!<br />But because it&#039;s not true, you can no produce the evidence.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your accusations of us mixing our mixed speed with rat poison gives me the suspicion your a vendor with another forum account that&#039;s trying to gives us a bad reputation. Hard to believe you&#039;ve got so much free time to be such a negative person, without having a motive.<br /><br />What do you want us to show to you? Do you even KNOW how to test amphetamine? I bet you don&#039;t have an idea. Sure, I understand you want the proof. I&#039;ll it sum up for you. You&#039;ll need acetone, a container which you can heat on a stove, a little bit of alcohol in a pippet. So the procedure:<br /><br /><br />1. Put your speed into a flask, beaker or some other container you can heat on a stove (note: use a stove without a naked flame, as these volatile organic chemicals produce explosive vapours).<br /><br />2. Pour acetone into the container so that the speed is completely submerged in it with a centimetre or 2 of excess liquid and swish it around to dissolve any soluble impurities.<br /><br />3. Gently heat the acetone until it boils, and then take it off the heat.<br /><br />4. Now slowly add (with an eyedropper or pipette) just enough alcohol for all the speed to dissolve - stirring gently until the speed dissolves. If you add too much alcohol you won&#039;t get as high a yield as possible so don&#039;t add too much.<br /><br />5. Anything that doesn&#039;t dissolve is adulterant and should be separated out by filtration: use 2 coffee filters in a funnel to filter the solution, then cover it so a little air can escape and leave to cool to room temperature.<br /><br />6. Once it has cooled down you should notice crystals starting to form.<br /><br />7. Put the container in the fridge, and then the freezer to encourage more crystals to form (i.e., increasing the yield). The slower the solution cools, the larger the dry crystals will be.<br /><br />8. Once the solution has been freezer cooled, filter the crystals out with some coffee filters, then wash the filtered out solid in the funnel with a few drops of alcohol and allow to dry.<br /><br />9. Voila, you have pure speed.<br /><br /><br />Okay, now that you know the procedure, you also know how we can provide you and everyone else with proof. Do you want us to photograph every single step in this procedure? And where should we host the images anonymously? First: This can be a risk, we&#039;ll have to very careful with making sure the pictures don&#039;t include anything that exposes the place we live. It&#039;s more proof for LE.<br /><br />Secondly, even if we would do this, it&#039;s still easy to forge fake evidence. <br /><br />Third: Our cook tested it, he&#039;s more of a professional and we know it&#039;s true. So we would like to let the reviews be the proof.<br /><br />Fourth: We snort the stuff ourselves and we KNOW that it&#039;s really good speed, it&#039;s the reason we mix it. We don&#039;t snort the up to 80% pure speed, because we think it&#039;s too strong. We mix it with paracetamol (which is perfectly safe, because if it wasn&#039;t, we wouldn&#039;t be snorting it ourselves) because otherwise it&#039;s too heavy on the nose and we&#039;ll stay awake for too long. We don&#039;t always want stay awake a whole evening.<br /><br />Fifth: You also don&#039;t have an idea what it takes to be a vendor here, lot of preparation and hard work is involved that you don&#039;t see. Making this proof takes time, and it isn&#039;t our top priority right now. We might do it later, but don&#039;t expect it. People should trust on the reviews.<br /><br />Everything i mention here is all clearly stated on our product listings of our unmixed and mixed speed. I suggest you go read them, before throwing more ignorant accusations at us.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.msg851298#msg851298">Quote from: wasta on February 23, 2013, 01:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Like a formula 1 driver it takes experience to become the best seller of SR, just the same.<br /><br />But if you are nest month nr 1 in selling speed.

Look at the other arguments above. We also clearly recommend you should mix it, because else it might be too strong. So we mix it ourselves so it&#039;s safe to use. <br /><br />Why don&#039;t admit it? Almost all listings on SR are mixed with caffeine, lidocaine or other stuff. Street stuff is even worse, and experienced users know this. Nothing strange or wrong about admitting that we&#039;ve mixed it. We mix it so we can rest assure that it&#039;s safe to use for our customers, and ourselves. We&#039;re not selling speed which is mixed by someone else. We buy it pure, sell the pure variant, and sell a mixed variant. Safety is our top priority.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.msg851298#msg851298">Quote from: wasta on February 23, 2013, 01:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Sure you obtain good speed &quot;&quot;newbie!&quot;&quot; . the first dealer who said I have real crap speed to sell to you, and even the little better quality is still crap I still have to meet.<br /><br />Be nr 1 seller next month , and stop wasting our time !!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand that there have been people on SR which had untrue product information, but they are long gone.

				You misunderstoot<br /><br />You admitted to mix your speed.<br /><br />So my question is with...ratpoison? Atropine?<br /><br />And if you are so sure that you have 70% or 80% speed too, why don&#039;t you put the proof along with it?<br /><br />I never said you mixed atropine or ratpoison, but you know that those shit is mixed in speed in the Netherlands.<br /><br />If you have missed that info, I will look it up again and place it specially for you.<br /><br />Buy why mix something so cheap as speed?<br />Why mix anyway?<br /><br />Don&#039;t blame me for giving you a bad name, I only use your own words...

Please don&#039;t take this as a personal attack, it&#039;s just that seeing that information is troubling to say the least, and thank you for telling people what you use as an adulterant. <br /><br />Do a google search if you&#039;re having trouble believing this, and here is a quote from wikipedia: &quot;Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is, by far, the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom&quot;

Please don&#039;t take this as a personal attack, it&#039;s just that seeing that information is troubling to say the least, and thank you for telling people what you use as an adulterant. <br /><br />Do a google search if you&#039;re having trouble believing this, and here is a quote from wikipedia: &quot;Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is, by far, the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Our MIXED speed IS NOT intended for smoking or injecting. And it was never intended for it, only for snorting. Our UNMIXED speed, which this thread is about, is suitable for smoking and injecting.<br /><br />When you smoke or inject speed, it should be as pure as possible... you should know that since you&#039;re also interested in injecting it. So why did you consider buying our unmixed speed in the first place? You should always buy our pure speed if you want to smoke or inject it.<br /><br />I was already getting aware of this because I noticed that so many people in other parts of the world started messaging me about smoking and injecting speed, which we don&#039;t have experience with, only read about it. In the Netherlands smoking and injecting speed is uncommon, everybody snorts it and I&#039;ve never even seen anyone smoke or inject speed here. There might be people that do it here, but not that we know of. So we totally forgot to take this into consideration, since we&#039;re shipping to the world.<br /><br />It&#039;s not unusual here that people mix speed with paracetamol.. Snorting our mixed speed with paracetamol isn&#039;t that bad as your portraying it to be, we do this all the time and we don&#039;t notice any side effects to this. We&#039;ve snorted speed with caffeine in the past, but we didn&#039;t like it because the caffeine makes you all sweaty etc... we like speed with paracetamol or just pure speed, the best. We don&#039;t know a mixing agent that&#039;s suitable for every purpose, smoking, injecting and snorting, which we like.<br /><br />On the long run all drugs are bad. You also have people that take tons of painkillers orally each and every day, where they get WAY more APAP in their body&#039;s then when you would snort it! But we don&#039;t do more then 3gr on an evening, and we&#039;re not heavy users and maybe it&#039;s different when people use way more. It&#039;s also a bit they&#039;re own responsibility, like every other drug there is. Our opinion is that you&#039;ll have to snort A LOT of mixed speed with paracetamol to notice any side effect from the paracetamol.<br /><br />Smoking and injecting is another story, and I fully agree that there are better alternatives on mixing speed when you want to do that. However we don&#039;t have any experience with that, and we didn&#039;t expect this many people buying our speed that would like to inject or smoke it. Therefore we fully understand your concerns, and you are right that mixed speed with paracetamol is not suited for smoking and injecting. <br /><br /><br />We gathered and we spoke about this and we came a conclusion that we are going to stop selling our mixed speed altogether. Again, we think it&#039;s not that harmfull when snorting speed we understand other parts of the world might not do that even when they&#039;re informed to only snort it. Even when our product page would clearly say you should NOT buy our MIXED speed for smoking and injecting it, some people will probably still do it. <br /><br />We want to prevent this from happening because we didn&#039;t take this into consideration at first, so we decided users should only be able to mix our unmixed speed themselves. Although this shouldn&#039;t be too bad when you do it for some time,&nbsp; your right that you shouldn&#039;t smoke and inject mixed speed consistently.<br /><br />What people do with the drugs they buy is partly their responsibility, but we recognize it&#039;s also ours. We want to always provide safe stuff, safety is always our first priority. When you want to smoke or inject speed you should only buy the most pure speed available, which is unmixed. It should be your only option.<br /><br /><br />Summed up the reasons why we decided to stop selling mixed:<br /><br />1. The idea behind also offering a mixed speed listing when we began was because we wanted to provide this *extra* service, because we think most people don&#039;t snort our purest speed from the start. For example: we don&#039;t always snort our pure speed, mostly mixed. And we&#039;ve been doing this for a long time. The mixing enabled us to offer speed which was cheaper and it was ready to snort for everybody, which would still be strong but which didn&#039;t force you to stay up all night.<br /><br />It was never intended for injecting or smoking from the start, but we didn&#039;t take into account that many people might do this in other country&#039;s. In down under, Australia, the opposite is true. I&#039;ve heard they mostly smoke and inject it, compared to snorting. In Holland it&#039;s the opposite, which I&#039;ve already explained. Heard of it before, but wasn&#039;t fully aware of it anymore when we decided to list it.<br /><br />2. It only takes us extra effort to create mixed speed, and we don&#039;t earn anything extra on it. We made more on the pure unmixed speed, so it was not a financial motive from our perspective.<br /><br />3. We already have so much orders and we are growing way too fast that we&#039;re having trouble keeping up with things. We&#039;ve got too much money in escrow now due to many (long) shipping times to the USA and Australia. We don&#039;t require our customers to FE, so we have to wait for every order until we get paid. We would first like to wait for some orders to arrive and then exchange some BTC for Euro&#039;s before we grow any further. <br /><br />In short: We don&#039;t need the mixed speed for expanding our business, we are already growing too fast. <br /><br />4. We want to listen to our customers, your input is appreciated and actively listened to. Because of your feedback we came to the conclusion that everything we sell here needs to be safe for every purpose, we didn&#039;t want to solve this by simply putting a warning on our old mixed speed listings that you should only snort it. <br /><br />5. We don&#039;t have it in stock anymore so perfect time to stop making and selling mixed speed. :)<br /><br /><br />We would like to thank you for thinking with us, you and other people helped shape this decision. :)<br /><br />We are looking forward to your review of our PURE speed, and would also love to know if it&#039;s also good for smoking/injecting... and how potent it is for that purpose! Since we don&#039;t have any experience about that, we would love to know it. This way we know our pure speed is also safe for that usage.<br /><br />Long story short: from now on ONLY our highest quality unmixed speed available to purchase, no mixed alternatives anymore. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.msg854810#msg854810">Quote from: wasta on February 24, 2013, 03:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You misunderstoot<br /><br />You admitted to mix your speed.<br /><br />So my question is with...ratpoison?

You are right that our customers deserve proof of our products, and we are happy to provide it once we have (more) of it. It&#039;s in everybody&#039;s interest to get proof, but we can&#039;t rush proof, give us some time before placing accusations. Like I explained above - there are certain steps involved when you want to create legit &#039;laboratory&#039; proof (testing the purity) which I&#039;ve described above, and we currently simply don&#039;t have the time for it. In the meantime our customer reviews are our proof, which we now have. <br /><br />Update: Someone brought our speed to a drug test lab - awaiting the results, look here -&gt; http://braqrsskizlusigz.onion/<br /><br /><br /><br />We don&#039;t deserve you accusing us of mixing our speed with that crap. We were honest from the start that we also had a mixed listing, and why we offered it. We put many hours of hard work in this, please also take that into account and try our speed yourself and then judge us. When you mention it it&#039;s also accusing us for it. I&#039;ve never heard of people mixing speed with the things you mention above, but we obviously don&#039;t do that.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.msg854810#msg854810">Quote from: wasta on February 24, 2013, 03:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Buy why mix something so cheap as speed?<br />Why mix anyway?<br /><br />Don&#039;t blame me for giving you a bad name, I only use your own words...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Did you read my last post? Please re read it, it&#039;s clearly explained... I&#039;ll repeat it for you, we think it&#039;s too strong for some people to snort. You don&#039;t always want to stay up a whole night, because you can&#039;t sleep when you&#039;ve used it. This can be solved by making it less strong, thus mixing it. We don&#039;t always snort it pure/unmixed ourselves,&nbsp; we mostly snort it mixed. That&#039;s why we decided to also provide a mixed listing.<br /><br />But after reconsideration we don&#039;t mix it anymore for above reasons, read that when you want to know why.<br /><br />Please try and snort our unmixed speed yourself, it&#039;s really strong and you will stay awake the whole night if you do it in the evening, if that&#039;s your goal. Or mix it and the chance will be higher you can sleep after using it, which is desirable if you want to sleep after using it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know how I can make this more clear to you, hope you understand now. And BTW would love to see you change your mind about us and our products... so try us out.. :P<br /><br />I can give you some proof right now.. I&#039;ve just found someone who found out, and says the same and experienced the same while testing our speed. Loved his message, made me laugh.. and exactly what I needed... :P<br /><br /><br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Proof &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br /><br />We try to list as much proof below, read it if you want proof.<br /><br /><br />Read the quote below from remoulade, just saw this post which was posted in the general speed review thread located here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4750.4470<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=4750.msg863086#msg863086">Quote from: remoulade on February 27, 2013, 12:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just to update on BDD...

I&#039;d say I peaked at around 20:00 to 21:00, then plateaued until the early hours. <br /><br />I should probably add that I ate a handful of etizolam at midnight, about 5mg, but this just made me a bit wobbly and didn&#039;t help me sleep. I didn&#039;t take a lot of this speed at all, so I&#039;m very confused to be honest. Maybe this is just really clean speed?

The reason I would consider purchasing your mixed speed is for the same reason as you, when I don&#039;t wanna be up that long. It can be hard to get a small enough dose if it&#039;s actually really pure. Normally good speed is cut with B-12 . If it&#039;s not that good it&#039;s cut with caffeine to mislead people . B-12 is harmless as a cut and cheaper than tylenol which is the reason I recommended it. And you won&#039;t notice any side effects from snorting tylenol. Until you go and get your liver function checked three years from now. It&#039;s not intended to be ingested frequently via any ROA. People who take vicodin or percocet even as prescribed for years fuck up their livers due to the APAP content. Your choice though if you want to ingest that =], thank you for your decision not to sell it anymore.&nbsp; I look forward to receiving your sample as well (My ears are acting like satellites waiting for the mail hoping everyday that today will be the day) and will leave a review here as well as in the rumour mill.&nbsp; I really hope that yours is as good as you say, to be honest I have a good feeling about you as a vendor especially since you&#039;ve been so honest about things that some people obviously won&#039;t be thrilled about and the fact that you&#039;ve been very prompt thus far in informing me of the status with my order.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;All the best.

You don&#039;t know anything about pharmacology or toxicology obviously. Paracetamol is used medically worldwide due to plain ignorance of the fact that there are non-toxic natural alternatives like bromelain and papain. Bromelain is basically free, too, kind of like outdoor cannabis, as it&#039;s found in the stem waste and not&nbsp; in the part of the fruit people eat. Paracetamol kills more people than heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, MDMA, and meth combined every year. ANY amount of it is bad for you; there&#039;s no reason to take it, ever, for anyone.<br /><br />Please read at least the ABSTRACTS of some scientific research done on paracetamol before dismissing peoples&#039; complaints about being sold amphetamine mixed with poison: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11215692<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason to cut any drug with anything at all, in the first place. If you think a drug is too potent for the general public to handle, like fentanyl citrate, then don&#039;t sell it at all. If you have any other justification for cutting, it&#039;s bullshit.<br /><br />Here are some potential healthier cutting agents you could be using: inositol (used to be known as Vitamin B8!), mannitol, hydroxy-propyl-betacyclodextrin, piracetam, methylsulfonylmethane.

Please re read it&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Yes I did.<br /><br />The very same when a coke seller say &quot;&quot;my stuff is 80% pure&quot;&quot;.<br /><br />Because when you cook 1 gram in ammonia, there will be 0.8 gram left after cleaning.<br />So that means my coke is 80% pure...<br /><br />But that is not the way a test works , so I thought it would be better not to point this out FOR YOU.<br />It doesn&#039;t make you look good.<br /><br />But here you are , at your service !<br /><br /><br />Babe babe babe , I can not believe this...<br />Most people would appreciate it not to be pointed out as stupid.<br /><br />I will do damage control and leave it as it is, instead of bumping your post just to give you a chance here.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do speed, but others would like to know how much you cut your speed and with what.<br />Seemed a legit question to ask after you proudly admitted to cut your speed.<br />That&#039;s all.<br /><br />I hope you do keep up your word and stop the mixing.<br />And a real lab test is as easy as posting a letter.There are certain steps like licking the stamp...<br /><br />I used to go to VNN in Leeuwarden, Oostergoweg 8.<br />Je geeft je &quot;&quot;moster&quot;&quot; af en krijgt een bewijsje en een datum mee wanneer je het resultaat op kan halen.<br />Een Marquis test kan ter plekke, dan weet je dat er dope in zit, maar niet hoeveel, voor percentages van de mixing, zoals manitol, paracetamol (heb ik ook al in heroine aangetroffen) caffeine etc, maar ook de percentages opiaten (alkaloiden) als papaverine, thebaine, codeine, morfine etc moet je wachten op de echte labttest.<br />Je hebt maar 0,1 gram nodig voor de test en de test id gratis.<br />Je hoeft er alleen maar heen te gaan.<br />Geen naam of adres wordt gevraagd, alles is anoniem.<br /><br />Sorry guys, this guy is Dutch and he thought it would be to much work to get a real labtest of his gear<br /><br />(Totaal niet blij met je gemix. Al ben ik blij dat je het zelf toegeeft. Kan er niemand zeuren ook over de kwaliteit. Paracetamol? Ik hoop dat je maar weet wat je doet, echt!)
