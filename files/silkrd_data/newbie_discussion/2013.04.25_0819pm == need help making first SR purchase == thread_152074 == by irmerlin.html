				been lurking for a while, decided to get some bitcoins and make an SR purchase (yay!)<br />but im worried im not doing enough to make sure both me and the vendor are safe, secure, and most importantly anonymous.<br /><br />Could someone message me and walk me the thru must do&#039;s and must NOT do&#039;s of buying. <br /><br />Just need help answering some questions like:<br />is just using ToR browser bundle enough?<br />do i need to launder my Btc wallet?<br />^ if so, how do i do that. <br /><br />so on and so fourth.<br /><br />now i know it would be easy to just sit here and call me a noob and shit, but if someone out there who is actually willing to lend a kind, helping , informative hand, that would be unreal ! thanks guys !!

				Yes the TOR browser bundle is adequate.<br /><br />No you don&#039;t need to launder your BTC&#039;s silk road will do it for you. As a result it will take a couple (or more) hours before your balance appears in your silk road account, don&#039;t panic cause that&#039;s normal, your coins need to finish tumbling.<br /><br />Beyond that, encrypt any personally identifiable information for your own protection and never ever FE.

				I think he means when sending your name and address to a vendor, for shipping, encrypt it with PGP...there are tutorials on here

				I know PGP can seem kinda crazy or something.<br /><br />But, make yourself a key anyways. You can save it as a txt or something. Make sure it has your handle or a vendor might get confused. If you don&#039;t want any hassle with GPG or something I used this for the longest time:<br />https://www.igolder.com/PGP/<br /><br />Peace and safe travels on the road,

				<br /><br />Don&#039;t FE, and always use pgp encryption.<br /><br />Be aware however, if you have zero or very few transactions under your belt, a vendor may ask you to FE before dealing&nbsp; with you. <br /><br />There are three answers to this..&nbsp; <br /><br />a) find a vendor who doesn&#039;t ask for FE.<br />b) buy some lottery tickets or ebooks, in order to raise your buyers&#039; stats. <br />c) actually FE with the vendor. <br /><br />imo, there&#039;s no need to ask a buyer to FE. The escrow system is in place to protect both buyer and seller, but it does happen. Some vendors even offer freebies and stuff if you FE.<br /><br />Just use some common sense really.
