				Hi there,<br /><br />I am new here and I have few ideas and questions. Sorry If it sounds stupid :)<br /><br />I want to first buy some bitcoins using a prepaid card. Which website is the best for that ?<br />Then I&#039;d like to buy some CCs to buy more bitcoins. Finally I would like to cash out those bitcoins using an Anonymous VISA card.<br /><br />What are the precautions to take ? I am safe browsing SilkRoad just using TOR or should I use a proxy/VPN ?<br /><br />If you have any advice, I am open to learn from expert.<br /><br />Thanks

Selling legal stuff is good enough on here to get whatever it is you want.<br />I know they are rather highly priced but so are btcs. 100&#039;s of vendors sell legal stuff on here like packs of syringes, glass pipes, clothes, blotter art paper, cigarettes. Find something you have easy access to that not everyone does and dont just think about domestic buyers, say cigarettes are highly prized over seas, esp if they are cheaper. Most people would not entertain this but supply and demand is how all marketplaces survive and prosper.

				Thanks for your help Mr Washington. It is my first day here and I&#039;ve seen many illegal stuffs that&#039;s why I thought this was a place for easy money. I will think about what you said and try to find some interesting stuff to sell here.<br /><br />Anyway, what is the best BTC wallet ? I mean an anonymous way to buy BTC and use it safely and easily ?<br /><br />Thanks again.

There&#039;s countless ways to get bitcoins...i dont have all morning to spend on this topic but i&#039;ll try to find you a link to sources in a bit.
