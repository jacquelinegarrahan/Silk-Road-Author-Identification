I have seen this happen before. I have scored off a vendor on the road then seen the same vendor at Black market reloaded and got burnt. They were scamming by impersonating trusted vendors from the road. I would be very careful and if they say they are TN then I would find that hard to believe. The only way to know for sure is to pm him on the road.

				I have just had a reply from the Atlantis TN and he says he is not the same TN and didnt know there was a vendor by this name on the road.he is pretty gutted about having the same name but was more concerned whether SR TN was a bad vendor as he thought it might affect his trade.I have advised him to put something in his profile to say that he sells from Atlantis only and isnt associated with TN from SR.

				Hey shiftingsands<br /><br />I see you mentioned uglydoll. Well I have ordered two 0.2 bags from UglyDoll - placed the order last Thursday and got a message on Friday saying that my order will be sent out on Monday. I presume that this will take at least two days to reach me, so I will update you on quality and so on whereupon it arrives.

Perhaps he&#039;s not a scammer. I&#039;m certain he is trying to cash in on the SR TN though. Anyone going to the effort of messaging him is bound to do the same to the guy on SR so it&#039;s not worth trying to continue the deception in his message. Have you tried his stuff yet? If it&#039;s good skag, fair play. I don&#039;t care if names himself after my mum. Feedback is not hard to fake though.

				ive used atlantis for buys now twice..once from Spanishfly and once from newWorldorder and both stayed in escrow and both items came in timely fashion(NW was US to US dmt and Spanishfly was Spain to US for hash...only took like 11 days:)&nbsp; i enjoy being able to spend my mined litecoin there or have option to pay using ltc and btc, that being said i have seen ALOT of vendors on there requesting FE and thats a big no-no.&nbsp; I think just Dont FE and make sure to buy from someone who already has reviews and you should be good.
