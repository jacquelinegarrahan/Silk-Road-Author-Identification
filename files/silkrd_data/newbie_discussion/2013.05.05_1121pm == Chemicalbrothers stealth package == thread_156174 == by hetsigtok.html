				So I was thinking of buying some candy from the Chembros. Im a paranoid kind of guy so if I order I wanna make sure everyone is as stealth as possible. So ofc Im going for the stealth package.<br /><br />Im wondering a little bit what that means tho. I asked them and I got a pretty cryptic message back which didnt help me a lot. But I understand they wanna keep things like that a secret. So without going into details can someone tell me a little bit about it? Like can you see the pills if you just look around a tiny bit in the package or is it so suppah-duppah stealth that you pretty much have to rip the whole package apart to find it?<br /><br />I didnt wanna bother them with too many questions since they are probably very busy with all their orders. <br />

				you aren&#039;t really meant to talk openly about a vendors stealth as LE read these forums so you probably wont get a specific answer, you will have to order and find out. <br />I guess really great stealth imo is if the package is opened and the contents can&#039;t be immediately identified and have no smell. But it depends if its domestic or international as to whether or not you need that much stealth, but more is always better. definetely dont want to be able to feel the pills from the outside.

				People don&#039;t want you mentioning how a vendor ships their product. I&#039;ve got some really good packaging, even some really funny packaging. It&#039;d be great to start a thread on awesome stealth and such. But you can&#039;t.
