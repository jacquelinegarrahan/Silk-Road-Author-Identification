				Hello fellow SR members, I have been a longtime member of the silk road and a forum lurker... I have always had a big heart and helped out many people with small increments of BTC. I thought well if I have an extra little bit to spare, why not help someone that is in need.&nbsp; I am that person today.&nbsp; I am only in need of a very small amount, .03 btc. I usually help others out without expecting anything in return, but I am willing to pay back .06 which is double what I am asking for. I have GREAT trust in our community and our support for eachoter. <br /><br />Thank You again, Acidicmonkey<br /><br />Wallet Address: 1vatmFyQbR3j1fRdYSd14wfYkGdcvvNLW

				Do you guys just link to your SR wallet in your forum sigs and when asking for the odd spare amount to cover postage, etc., or do you link to an offsite wallet and THEN send to your SR wallet?

				Thanks mary, yeah I was looking in the spare coins thread and was like oh yeah wait Im a forum NOOB.... I hope someone is able to help me out, I double pinky swear promise to pay them back!!! It doesnt work if you dont pay back because then that person has every right to black list me in their postings.&nbsp; I am a very generous person and whoever can help me out will understand that very quickly. I would even be willing to send one of the tabs I have left over to someone for their generosity.
