				There are always the old stand by&#039;s, the classics like Floyd, Zeppelin and The Beatles. If you&#039;re looking for something more fresh, check out The Black Angels or Dead Meadow for new-school psychedelia. I also enjoy more abstract stuff like Animal Collective and I love to trip to Tool.

				I listened to Black Flag&#039;s on shrooms once. I was so happy and energized!<br /><br />Also, Animal Collective is pretty great. Summertime Clothes is about tripping, so it&#039;s pretty perfect.

				I have no idea why Shpongle didn&#039;t cross my mind... I&#039;ve seen Simon Posford live and it was insane. First time doing ketamine. ;) Yes, &quot;Star Shpongled Banner&quot; and &quot;No Turn Left Unstoned&quot; are some great tracks.<br /><br />Also I have guided someone in their first trip listening to Mars Volta... they&#039;re great but they can be a bit too intense at times. Kinda freaked the guy out a little. I like stuff like that more when I&#039;m on speed than tripping, still it just depends on what you like and what works for you.<br /><br />The Mars Volta was amazing seeing them live, tripping on some of the best acid I&#039;ve ever done.

I was 17 and it was the night of my senior prom. A friend was driving my car. She wasn&#039;t tripping, but she drank over a twelve pack while she drove us around our area for at least 5 hours -- not one of us even noticed. We were in that car driving aimlessly for hours before we went to a party. We smocked an ounce of weed between 5 people too. I&#039;m not sure how we didn&#039;t die or kill someone.<br /><br />But anyway, yeah the Simon and Garfunkel CD was playing over and over again. Eventually my trip went sour and I got really emotional over the lyrics. I was sobbing LMFAO. We ended up driving around and stealing peoples lawn ornaments, including a giant Santa Claus that my friend in the back seat swore was trying to attack him LOL! What a fucking night. Everyone else was grooving to the music, but I was hysterically crying. That&#039;s why I stopped dropping acid (but damn I wish I had some now hehe!

				For me, nothing beats listening to Pink Floyd albums while tripping. Especially Animals, Meddle, the entire Shine On You Crazy Diamond set.<br /><br />But also I have to say that the last 2 Tool albums feel like they&#039;re MADE for tripping (very possible) I didn&#039;t really like 10,000 Days until I heard it under the influence, and then it was one of the most epic listening experiences I&#039;ve ever had.

				Finally a thread I can ethically spam in until I get to 50 posts.<br /><br />Listening to music while high is one of my favorite things to do.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an obvious, but important point: <br /><br />DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC GIVE YOU DIFFERENT TYPES OF &quot;JOURNEYS&quot;.<br /><br />If you love exploring, be open-minded and listen to a huge variety of music. I recommend listening to certain &quot;genres&quot; in chunks of time before moving on to the next.<br /><br />I see that most people here only listen to variants of rock, which is so typical. Not saying this is bad, but you&#039;re missing out if you only stick to this genre. I can be a victim to this as well, since I mainly stick to jazz and progressive trance/house, but this is a reminder for me to explore.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- Progressive trance/house makes me feel like I&#039;m going through an epic, important, spiritual, and wistful journey.<br />- Progressive rock/metal is like the above, but feels much darker (so instead of wistful, it&#039;s a bit vengeful).<br />- Rap makes me feel visceral and seeing things as they really are. I used to think rap was stupid, but when I smoked, I finally got it (in a nutshell, it&#039;s about the lack of bullshit; keeping it real). Try Skyzoo - A Beautiful Decay.<br />- Jazz hop/instrumental hip hop is kind of like rap, but makes me more contemplative. Try P.R. - Sunchild.<br />- Funk, lol. This one makes me... well, it&#039;s quite obvious (hint: add a letter to the word &quot;funk&quot;). Fucking love this, especially when you get crossovers with electronic music.<br />- Classic rock makes me want to rock the fuck out and &quot;float&quot;.<br />- Jazz. God. Jazz is la crème de la crème of music. It&#039;s such a human achievement. The complexity of the music is just so rich and offers a variety of moods (since there&#039;s tons of sub-genres like modal jazz, bebop, swing, ragtime, post-jazz, etc.). Drops me into the 1950s and makes me calm, smart, and philosophical. And funky. If I wanna feel fucking cool, it&#039;s jazz, baby.<br />- Blues. This basically started western music today. If blues didn&#039;t exist, nothing you listen to would exist. Hits at the deepest and realest of emotions.<br />- Classical. To be honest, I haven&#039;t explored this yet. It&#039;s also a pretty vast genre, so I&#039;ve got tons of exploring to do here.<br /><br />There&#039;s other genres of course (reggae, acoustic music, dubstep, world music, latin, etc.), and you probably will have different experiences, but expand. Go out there and explore the world!

				Imo, G-FUNK INSTRUMENTALS ARE THE BEST! Nice flow to the songs which leave me floating and at the same time being able to analyze the song and hear new noises that I would have never heard sober. Ah I feel like tripping right now and laying in my room with a nice g-funk instrumental playlist going. Strictly187Murda has the best instrumentals I&#039;ve ever heard and I enjoy all of them, you can find him on youtube, his account has been removed but there are people who have uploaded his tracks. Check him out!

Dozens of versions, 30-50 minutes in length, each going through so many phases of emotion and intensity. &quot;Musical landscape&quot; is right, and Dark Star is a vast one. It is the sound of LSD. <br /><br />If I had to pick an album, it&#039;d be American Beauty- has brought me to tears of joy during every shroom trip in which I&#039;ve listened to it. As hard as it is to pick a landmark song off it, I&#039;d have to say it&#039;s Box of Rain or Brokedown Palace.<br /><br />One very deep dive into LSD I discovered the awe-inducing fusion work of Miles Davis, specifically the albums In a Silent Way and Bitch&#039;s Brew. Improvised music is by far my favourite thing to hear, on drugs or not, and these albums are such trips. They made me hear the jazz in the Dead, something I cannot unhear and will forever appreciate. Those guys and Miles were on the same trip. <br /><br />

				lol. I meant to ask for an album and song FROM Sphongle, but thanks for your response. I am aware of the cult following of the Grateful Dead, but actually never got around to listening to their music, so I just took the leap! Listening to the &quot;Live/Dead&quot; (1969) version, though I also listened to the album version to have an idea of how the song got &quot;expanded&quot; out.<br /><br />I&#039;m more of a fan of Miles Davis&#039; more canonical work and always felt that his frontier-expanding fusion work felt a bit too messy to me, but this feeling usually disappears from a listening reprise from my experience. After all, I was like &quot;WTF&quot; when I first listened to John Coltrane&#039;s Ascension, which is pretty much as improvisational as you can get for a free jazz track (format of the song: every one gets a solo: between every solo, every band member improvises over the transition, which can sound like a mess, but it&#039;s pretty darn cool). Even though it&#039;s really really messy, I began to appreciate it after a while.

I meant to ask for an album and song FROM Sphongle, but thanks for your response. I am aware of the cult following of the Grateful Dead, but actually never got around to listening to their music, so I just took the leap! Listening to the &quot;Live/Dead&quot; (1969) version, though I also listened to the album version to have an idea of how the song got &quot;expanded&quot; out.<br /><br />I&#039;m more of a fan of Miles Davis&#039; more canonical work and always felt that his frontier-expanding fusion work felt a bit too messy to me, but this feeling usually disappears from a listening reprise from my experience. After all, I was like &quot;WTF&quot; when I first listened to John Coltrane&#039;s Ascension, which is pretty much as improvisational as you can get for a free jazz track (format of the song: every one gets a solo: between every solo, every band member improvises over the transition, which can sound like a mess, but it&#039;s pretty darn cool). Even though it&#039;s really really messy, I began to appreciate it after a while.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha, my bad! I got really into the first three Shpongle albums all at once a long time ago, but the sheer surprise of the first one (Tales of the Inexpressible) will forever deem it the one that made the biggest impression on me. Everything after it is good ol&#039; Shpongle, and once you get used to their bag of tricks a lot of their music bleeds together. I especially feel that way about their most recent album, but that was one I revisited many years after my love affair with them, so it was like trying to feel comfortable in my 16-year-old outfits. You got me listening to Tales of the Inexpressible again and I&#039;m loving it. <br /><br />If you find fusion Miles messy, then the Dead may seem to be downright disheveled, but I think I can speak for thousands when I say that their jams can be addictive like nothing else on this Earth. I wish you a happy adventure through Dead space, and may you find the reward of theirs so many of us have :)

				I really love listening to the Glitch Mob. It was what I listened to my first trip, and it was pretty amazing.
