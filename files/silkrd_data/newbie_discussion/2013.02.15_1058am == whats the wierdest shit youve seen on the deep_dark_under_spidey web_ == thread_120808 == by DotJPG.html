				TBH i&#039;m ashamed but i just couldn&#039;t imagine it so i had to see: CP. but the real disturbing part was when i realized, that apparently there are fathers out there who raise their daughters in the belief that sucking their daddys dick etc. is normal. they basically raise their own sex slaves, destroying their childhood and even upload it for other people to watch. if i knew someone who does this i&#039;d cut his fucking dick off and stick it up his ass.<br />the other very disturbing thing i saw was called &quot;fuck meat&quot;. it seems there is some sort of mafia out there who kidnap women, cut off their legs and arms and offer them as...well....fuck meat.<br />when you see shit like this you start hating the whole world...

				I just visit the the deep web to buy drugs, and to learn a little bit about carding. <br />Reading this thread so far, it seems I am definitely in the lightweight corner.

Never even heard of that kind of thing before. <br />Not to mention those hitmen for hire idiots. lol<br /><br /><br />I think most of us have seen the hidden&nbsp; wiki, or at least some kind of mirror/cleaned/variation of it.

				I come here to buy drugs and then I leave. I come to the darkweb for what I want, and it&#039;s wonderful, but I have absolutely no desire to go to any other part for the even darker purposes...

				I came across a bondage themed darkweb site and sort of secret society (i know its the darkweb why make it secret!) but it was basically these rich Arabs and this one woman from high ranks of society and she was discussing with them the possibility of organizing a camel screw. Some other person then started asking this female questions about this society...my goodness if we only knew. <br /><br />Rich sheiks organizing massive pedo orgies, this woman used to fuck horses and other exotic breeds while some sultan watched on and wanked, then the sex slaves as well.<br /><br />Opened up a box that was just bursting to be opened by me.
