				You could always purchase money-packs and then trade for BTC with a well reviewed vendor.&nbsp; It may not be the cheapest option but it should work fine.&nbsp; Have you heard back from BitInstant yet?&nbsp; I have heard in the past that their customer service was extremely helpful which is why I have continued using them.&nbsp; I also would prefer an option cheaper than 4% but in reality, for how easy the service is after using a few times, and the fact that they must be compensated for their effort it could be much worse.&nbsp;

				I just print the BitInstant quote for sending to Mt. Gox.&nbsp; I then take in my quote, fill out the quick account info, and then hand them cash.&nbsp; By the time I get home, my Mt. Gox account has funds and I am free to purchase the BitCoins when I prefer, which is generally immediately.&nbsp; Walmart doesn&#039;t require any photo id and if you add BitCoins often, you can just grab a stack of the carbon copy forms and have it filled out before you leave your house.&nbsp; My first time trying to load BitCoins it seemed so long and tedious but now I just do in 5 min at the end of my shopping trip at Walmart after grabbing +$100 savings from the PurpleLotus Coupon Collection.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I used bitinstant for the first time a few days ago and it was quick and painless with bitcoins in my wallet within an hour. I don&#039;t mind the fee for the convenience they offer.

				I have sent three messages to Bitinstant support. They have never responded. When using them to transfer from Dwolla, the fastest was 1 week. The slowest was 22 days. <br /><br />However, when I sent using moneygram, it was deposited within the hour.

				I worked everything out. You can PM Yankee (Charlie, BitInstant CEO) on the bitcointalk forums. They have a active support thread.<br /><br />BitInstant has been shitty for my lately. My money would get stuck in the system, and wait for them to manually do the transfer. It takes a couple days because i&#039;m not the only one, probably hundreds of people nationwide.

				Glad to hear you worked everything out. Was there a specific reason why the transfer did not go through automatically?
