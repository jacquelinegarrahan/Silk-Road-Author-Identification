				I ordered a half ounce of some bud from a vendor here in the usa... When I did that I ordered a few other packages from some other vendors out of the country<br /><br />Well needless to say the packages from outside the country already showed up but my local package isn&#039;t here... The vendor keeps saying that me messaging once a day is too much! I need to wait 4-5 days for a response to my 1 pm... And also says he has tracking but for some odd reason won&#039;t issue it to me or anything...<br /><br />What do you guys think about this? Does it sound like I have been selectively scammed? The vendor has a 99% feedback score and ONLY ships to the USA... Everyone else&#039;s package has arrived safely and all my other packages have arrived... What do you think I should do here? Based on ur answers I will make a thread in the rumor category

				@livestr0ng<br /><br />Why would I submit for another 2 week wait? He&#039;s in the USA and so am I! SR gives 17 days to receive product that&#039;s PLENTY of time for a domestic order to arrive

				If you want to get anything out of this system you need to acknowledge that selective scamming is a possibility and that it is difficult to differentiate from an unintended error of some sort. It&#039;s a shame when it happens but you can take precautions to avoid it; extensively communicating with a vendor and building some form of trust before you order from them is one.

				hmm sounds like you are going off half cocked here bro!&nbsp; Shit happens in the postal system, stuff gets lost/damaged/misplaced at times, you SHOULD really arrange an extension<br /><br /><br />Vendors generally aren&#039;t here to scam people, and reacting as you have is not going to make you ANY&nbsp; &#039;friends&#039; (aka &#039;good connects&#039;)&nbsp; by behaving this way.&nbsp; Do you not think that other vendors read these posts also?&nbsp; <br /><br />We LIKE vendors to read our forum posts.&nbsp; Cant say we&#039;d feel the same if we had your attitude!<br /><br /><br />good luck bro, keep this up and you&#039;ll need it<br /><br /><br />mmmmmm???
