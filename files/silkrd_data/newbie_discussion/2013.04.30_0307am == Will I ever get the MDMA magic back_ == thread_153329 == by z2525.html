				I&#039;ve been taking MDMA for awhile and honestly I use to abuse it pretty bad. When I take MDMA I only get a slight roll that lasts maybe an hour an a half. Is it possible to lower my tolerance? I&#039;m going to take a break for a long time, I really wish I didn&#039;t abuse it because I absolutely love the feeling and would rather have spaced it out. Will I ever lower my tolerance and how long before I do? <br /><br />thanks guys

				No. Once it&#039;s gone you should quite forever. Same thing happen with DXM. There are limits to what these drugs will do for you and thank god because if you lost the magic a lot later than you normally do you&#039;d wind up with quite a lot more brain damage.

				Id say quit for a good six months, maybe take some 5-htp supplements to raise your serotonin levels. Your shit is drained homie. If you got no serotonin to release there ain&#039;t gonna be any magic. I usually wait 4-6 weeks in between rolls and I&#039;m floored every time.

				Your shit is drained. If you are looking to turn into a literal braindead skeleton, then continue with other drugs.<br /><br />I suggest at least a week to two week cleanse from all drugs except maybe a little booze or pot. Take some 5-HTP supplements and eat a lot of healthy shit.<br /><br />I suggest a 3 to 6 month long break from MDMA or any stimulant. If you don&#039;t, the words &quot;like&quot; and &quot;uhhh&quot; will permanently be your entire vocabulary.<br />

				Try piracetam and a long break, like a year or more.<br /><br />You will need to take piracetam every day for several weeks.&nbsp; It also would not hurt to also take fish oil and 5-htp but the most important thing is time. A month is NOT enough. All of these things should also be taken for a few weeks before MDMA use at the least if you do not take them daily. <br /><br />I was like you and took allot of MDMA, like once or twice a month for a few years and one time it just didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; But I took a year off and took the things I listed above and the next time BOOM I rolled balls.&nbsp; I now only use MDMA a few times&nbsp; a year MAX and I can keep the magic.

				There&#039;s lsd, shrooms, and ghb. None of those are stims so you don&#039;t have to worry about any kind of brain depletion. Just keep the doses low and do your research beforehand in regards to safe practices. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about supplementing with 5-htp unless you&#039;re a vegetarian. People generally eat more than they realize through meat and dairy. But do clean up your eating habits if possible :). The last time I had to take a 6 month break, diet and exercise helped a lot.

				Thanks for all the responses guys!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t rolled in a month or taken any other drugs besides alcohol, and I don&#039;t plan to for awhile. I also haven&#039;t had any fast food or fried food for 4 months now since I started working out.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve taken 5-htp but honestly I don&#039;t think it does much for me. I have been taking it since I started rolling to help my hangovers but I don&#039;t think it works for me that well. I currently use fish oils but I have never tried piracetam, I&#039;ve head mixed reviews about it, does it really work?

				I don&#039;t know how long it really takes, but you definitely get it back.<br />I was also a massive abuser of XTC pills but this was because I always bought them in bulk so I never could stay of them.<br />I took it 2-3 times a week; then ur really getting fucked up. After some XTC related incident I stopped all together for about a year and then when I took that first pill again,&nbsp; 8) boom <br />Since I hadn&#039;t taken XTC for about a year, I had no tolerance at all and I popped at +- 200 mg pill; I&#039;ve never seen my jaws go like that it was really freaky. I actually puked because the roll was to strong.

				exercise and a good diet are a major plus. You don&#039;t have to be a workout freak... if you exercise 30 minutes/3 to 4 times a week, you are doing more than over 90% of people.<br /><br />

As opposed to MDMA you can take it max. 2-3 days in a row if ur lucky.<br />It&#039;s actually a good thing about MDMA as it should prevent people from taking it too much. However my next bulk purchase is coming soon, so I&#039;ll see if I learned my lesson :p probably not lol

				How long would you guys recommend waiting in between rolls?&nbsp; I would do it once a week if it wouldn&#039;t hurt me.&nbsp; I guess once a month is too much also?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done any in a couple of months, I ran out.

				I have taken Mdma every month since Oct-2012&nbsp; like twice a month every other week and I still feel the magic!&nbsp; but I&#039;m supplementing with L-tryptophan powder each week to replenish my serotonin levels, what <br />you need is L-tryptophan and not 5htp as the tryptophan crosses the blood brain barrier far more effectively than does the 5htp. it is well to lay off the Mdma use for a month or two because it can become boring if<br />you do it too frequently like anything else. but seriously I have not lost the magic doing it twice a month for several months straight as long as your restoring your serotonin supply by the amino L-tryptophan you can<br />retain the magic and your serotonin. but you must study&nbsp; and take the l-tryptophan weekly.&nbsp; 8)

Yeah honestly i would recommend you wait at least one year until you try an MDxx again.&nbsp; It sounds like you over did it very badly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been rolling more often than i should, and i still roll very hard every time.&nbsp; During that year break try to be healthy.&nbsp; Exercise has shown to be the best thing for almost all mental issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldnt use 5HTP for more than two weeks.&nbsp; But definitely wait a year before you roll. Give your brain some time to rewire itself

				yeah man stay clean VERY clean do a liver cleanse stay off pot and booze. Fuck man stay away from booze forever.. then after a 2 months try a good dose. see how u react. DONT OVER DO IT! 2 pills max.. see how u do .. then if u are still not happy then go 3 months. Pill up again.. see how u are doing... maybe then u will hit your mark so then do a 3 month break and then slowly get it to 2.. every 3 months do a liver cleanse.. Seasons change is best.. Stay off the booze. Eat a very clean diet.. VERY clean try to rid your diet of animal for at least 2 times a week.. LOTS of air and non processed foods. FRESH veg.. time is right for it. Once u find what works for you then u are good for life just stick with that routine. <br /><br />i did mdma for well over 10 years. lsd.. fuck well over 100 time and at least a solid year every day on meth. i held down a job... own my own company with employees that get paid REGULARLY .. Its all about balance. its easy to get greedy but u pay for it on the back end. Just look at this as the time u have to pay your body back to do it again.
