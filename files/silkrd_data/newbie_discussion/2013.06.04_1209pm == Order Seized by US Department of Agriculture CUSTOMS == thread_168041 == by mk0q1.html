				(I recently ordered shroom spores, I ordered to California where shroom spores are illegal. <br />The order took about 16 days to arrive. The box was sitting at my doorstep with blue tape all over it that said &quot;Seized by US Department of Agriculture&quot;<br />I opened it to find a later stating that they had found &quot;Unknown Seed (Mail 287 Only) (Propagative Material)&quot; It also says that &quot;These Violations may result in Criminal or Civil penalties&quot;<br />I&#039;m very worried that I could get boned for this one, anyone have any helpful information?<br />

				Thats the route I&#039;m going to be taking. I didn&#039;t order shit.<br /><br />The letter has everything listed in steps, step 13 states &quot;Disposition: Prohibited Material Removed and Destroyed&quot;. In combination with the fact that it says &quot;Unknown Seed&quot; Is it possible they destroyed it before finding out that it was shrooms, and just let it go, and the rest of the letter is beaurocratic bullshit? <br /><br />It says &quot;The Material described was found to be moving in the mail in violation of the agriculture quarantine regulation pertaining to the entry and movement of plants, plant products, animal products soil, and plant pests. These violations may result in criminal or civil penalties. Disposition was taken under authority of laws administered by the U.S. Postal Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All Inquiries concerning condition, delays, shortages or breakage should be addressed to teh Postmaster at the above port (item 1). Information concerning quarantine in item 12 may be secured on application to US Department of Agriculture. APHIS P.P.Q. <br /><br />It then lists an address to contact them at. <br /><br />It shows my address, the mail tracking number, breakage, and whether or not it needed &quot;Reconditioning&quot; <br />14. Reason for Disposition :Material not Authorized Entry, and Phyto-Sanitary Certificate Missing. <br />15. Remarks Containers material for Propagation. No Phytosanitary Certificate, then they state what the package was disguised as. <br /><br />Don&#039;t they need a federal warrant to open up the package to begin with or can they open it up on site right then and there with probable cause?

				Do your research on the fact. Bing it, Google it. Ask it. Seem&#039;s to me you got scammed... if they wanted to bust you. You&#039;d be busted already.<br /><br />Atleast thats what I think...<br /><br /><br />If not. Being calm is key.<br />(Take your mind off it, image your fuckin a hot playboy model or someshit) idk hah

				I don&#039;t think you got scammed but I don&#039;t think you should worry. Don&#039;t contact them.<br /><br />As it&#039;s seeds they&#039;ll probably just destroy them.<br /><br />The letter is a warning just to throw a scare into you.<br /><br />That&#039;s just what I think.

My pal was nervous enough to remove her laptop from her house and made her orders elsewhere so there was no evidence of her making any purchases at her home.

				I ordered seeds a couple of years ago that got confiscated by customs, and I have had no issue receiving illegal goods from within my own borders. I have chanced ordering overseas... I think Mescaline, which came in an envelope that looked like it was from a travel company... Or some kind of fish food, I don&#039;t know- forget, but I haven&#039;t had any issues receiving domestic orders. <br /><br />I did however just have a package that arrived from Canada, not illegal goods (hemp seeds), that was opened and the customs tape was on the package. It wasn&#039;t confiscated and still weighed heavy, but I hope that this didn&#039;t set up a flag anyways in the USPS system. I don&#039;t think it did, because I received something (weed) just after.

				I think your only worry is maybe finding a new address to use. In the past I&#039;ve ordered LOTS of weed seeds from overseas . Although it never happened to me, I know a couple people that for whatever reason had their seeds stopped from customs . All they got was the scary letter, as long as they didn&#039;t try to fight it , nothing ever came of it. I&#039;m not talkin bout ordering from the Road here, this was long B4 SR.

				Yea the seeds I got were from &quot;Nirvana&quot; seeds in NL. Or one order came through but the other didn&#039;t. <br /><br />The first order was disguised in an iPod protector.

I chose super stealth for first time but secondI decided to save 5 bucks... which disn&#039;t save anything when it came down to it.<br /><br />It is no wonder it was opened. Label was handwritten. Tape all over package.<br /><br />I may chance things like small orders of K or legal things like RCs ordering overseas... But weed- my main deal... No need.been tempted to order from Canada because it seems cheaper sometimes (before shipping maybe), but nah.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The super stealth option on seed banks is almost always horrible.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; Now days all the super stealth is sent with tracking and signature and they put it in a motherfucking shirt, wallet or with a damn coffee mug.&nbsp; How is that stealthy on an x-ray, or even at all?!&nbsp; When you open a shirt and breeder packs fall out. ::)&nbsp; What the fuck?&nbsp; The seed banks need to learn about stealthiness from us!&nbsp; It really depends on what customs your seeds go through.&nbsp; Some are great and some snag so many seed orders. &gt;:(

				You need to get a new address if you&#039;re going to be ordering from overseas. Pretty sure once customs seizes contraband coming into the country, they flag the &#039;deliver to&#039; address for very close inspection of parcels to that address from that point forward.

				The post above mine is wrong. I received customs letters to a few addresses over the past year and have used the addresses multiple times to order a variety of different things from overseas. You stop using the address for a while.. couple months at least. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				No kidding. Hm, well I stand corrected. I guess it&#039;s another nod to the piece of advice to not believe everything you read. It does make sense though now that I think about it (derp). If they were checking the address of every piece of mail that entered the country, everything would take weeks or months to clear customs.

				I dont think you have anything to worry about,&nbsp; You got off when they figured out it was seeds..&nbsp; They probably were looking for some extreme virus outbreak vial when they seen the hugh syringes in the xray.&nbsp; who gives a fuck about seeds. There are only a few states spores are illegal in.&nbsp;

				Hey,<br />I&#039;ve been getting a bunch of stuff from overseas. Last week I had to go into the PO and sign for my package for no reason.I thought it was total setup, yet I went anyway. Turned out fine. I didn&#039;t get busted. Any idea why this happened? It was not registered mail? Should I be concerned that I have been red flagged?
