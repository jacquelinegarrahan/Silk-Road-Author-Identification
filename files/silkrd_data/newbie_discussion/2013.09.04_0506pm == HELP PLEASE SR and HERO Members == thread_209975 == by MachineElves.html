				Hi All,<br /><br />I have just received the following message in my SR inbox from a user called &quot;AutomatedMessage&quot; (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/070b1dfcfe) :<br /><br />**** START OF MESSAGE ****<br /><br />&quot;Dear MachineElves<br /><br /><br />It has come to our attention that a number of accounts - including yours - have fallen victim to a &#039;Phishing&#039; like scam which has compromised your privacy/security measures. It is very important that you follow the below instructions to eliminate potential harm to your account that this may cause. Please very carefully read/execute the following step by step procedure before any further actions are conducted on the MarketPlace. This procedure will create a temporary secure account which will eliminate your vulnerability to this such act.<br /><br />STEP 1 - You must immediately change your PIN number.<br /><br />STEP 2 - You must then change your passphrase/password.<br /><br />STEP 3 - You must transfer the balance of your account to your new/temporary account - using the &#039;withdraw Bitcoins&#039; feature located in your account settings.<br /><br />------------ Your Temporary Wallet Address is - 14XVu1douShyXEQLGPpy1Gn5UbAm7mQUwi<br /><br />STEP 4 - To Access your Temporary Account - simply login as you normally would - making sure the URL is - silkroadvb5piz3r.onion - But instead of your username being - ------------ MachineElves - Your new/temp username is - #XXXXXMachineElves - And your recently changed Passphrase/PIN will be active with this account.<br /><br />STEP 5 - Once you have accessed your new account - then once again change your passphrase and PIN.<br /><br />We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused - Regards SR Support.&quot;<br /><br />**** END OF MESSAGE ****<br /><br />I have replied to the message and asked how I can know this is a &quot;legit&quot; message and had no reply yet.<br /><br />I have changed my password and pin to something completely different and been able to update it and log out / in.<br /><br />CAN SOMEONE ADVISE IF THIS IS A PHISHING ATTEMPT OR A LEGIT MESSAGE FROM SR Support? <br /><br />I imagine anyone could create an account alias called AutomatedMessage and compose a fake message?<br /><br />Can anyone clarify?

				Hi SelfSovereignty&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thanks so much for the quick reply.<br /><br />Being a tech myself, I did think so which is why I simply,<br /><br />1) Updated my passphrase / pin to make it EVEN more complex (on existing account via clean machine)<br />2) Transferred my SR balance back to my personal wallet (just in case)<br />3) Posted here for help /advice (to back up my gut feeling and to get re-assurance)<br /><br />You have put my &quot;mind at rest&quot; SelfSovereignty - I sure wish I could give you Kudos for such a quick response.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES
