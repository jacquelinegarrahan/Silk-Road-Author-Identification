				i remember around 93 when the snowballs were going about. proper trippy as fuck E&#039;s. i did about 5 at a rave one night and after was driving home along the motorway. i kept seeing rabbits everywhere along the edge of the road then i remember looking further down the motorway and there was this huge lorry(truck), one of those big box type lorries that they transport electronics and deliver stuff to supermarkets in. only this was really huge, i was looking at it from like half a mile down the road and i could see from there that this thing was like 40ft high. aqnd there was all these ropes attached to it and i noticed as i got closer that there was all these dwarfs pulling at the ropes. i figured it must have broke down and they were trying to pull it to a safe spot or something. there must have been 40 dwarfs all pulling at this huge lorry. as i got right up close it suddenly became apparent that what i had been looking at was the back a big road sign on the opposite side of the road. lol, that was a pretty trippy night all together from what i remember of it, prolly shouldn&#039;t have been driving tbh.

				ahh MDA...<br /><br />Pretty sure my first pill was mainly MDA. At a festival ended up getting really paranoid which hasn&#039;t happened since, hearing people talking about me etc. Knew it wasn&#039;t real tho but still unnerving! Ended up going back to my tent and having a full on 3rd eye journey type thing... going through wormholes and eventually seeing the most incredible geometric orb type thing. That trip rivals some of my hardest shroom trips. Good times.

				Festivals are my favorite place to drop pills but it is a pretty trippy environment. I&#039;ve seen a dancing snake coming out the top of some fuckers head, it was composed of like tiny fireworks or something that were fizzing and popping, I could hear it even though he was far off from where I was. After it danced out of his head it just danced up into the sky, but what fucked me up was that nobody else was staring at it I couldn&#039;t believe everyone was ignoring it. Another time I thought my shoes were melting so I took them off and threw them away haha. It was sweltering summer festival times though.

				i have seen reptile beings shapeshifting in and out of human form on lsd.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s because my eye consciousness was at such a super high state of incoming signals, i could only interpret their being as a archetypal image embedded deep within the recesses of my dna. <br /><br />

				LSD down in Newport Beach visiting a very wealthy friend of mine. We decide to go for a late night stroll to 7-eleven (it was probably around 2am or so).<br /><br />We start walking, and my thoughts are getting twisted. Very twisted, you know, typical hallucinogen stuff. We are at a corner, waiting to cross the street. A car drives by us, and as the car passes us I get the most intense tracer I&#039;ve ever witnessed. Instead of typical multi-colored tracers following objects, I get an entire life experience.<br /><br />In the .3 seconds that it took for that car to speed past us, the image that followed was the entire life story of someone I don&#039;t know. I witnessed their birth, first steps, first day of school, their entire high school career, college, and their death in a car accident shortly after they graduated from college. All of this in the blink-of-an-eye tracer that followed a speeding car. Every thought that wen through their head, the intensity of his first kiss to the boredom of his high school classes, just waiting for something fun to happen. I witnessed his entire existence.<br /><br />Me: &quot;DUDE!&nbsp; DID YOU FUCKING SEE THAT CRAZY SHIT!?&quot;<br />Friend: &quot;Yeah man, the guy driving that sedan wasn&#039;t wearing a shirt!&quot;

				I was standing on an open plane once next to some train tracks while tripping at about 4 in the morning and this enormous machine came rolling past me with half a dozen men hanging off it. I have no idea what it was but it looked cool as fuck with lights on it shining up to the sky. I reckon it must have just been something that cleaned the rails but man they should do it more often.
