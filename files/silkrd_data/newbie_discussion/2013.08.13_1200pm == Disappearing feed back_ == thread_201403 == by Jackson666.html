				<br /><br />Made an order about a week ago with a SR vendor, he asked for early FE and I did finalize when it I saw it marked shipped one day after order placed. <br /><br />Have logged in since on his page and see my early fe on the feedback no longer appears, couple of other recent positive feed backs on this page gone too, also this chap no longer any active listings either, maybe ran out of product for all I know, I got the last and it&#039;ll be here tomorrow sort of story. So I begin to feel like I have an expensive lesson coming on. Have mailed the page only few hours ago, so no response yet so to be fair I haven&#039;t given much time to respond. <br /><br />In saying all this it might arrive tomorrow, at this early stage who&#039;s to say.&nbsp; Was just curious about the disappearing feed back thing. Can a vendor remove feed back or can it just disappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;

				<br />Not sure on the feedback issue. However I do wish you the best of luck with your order. And NEVER NEVER FE again.<br /><br />There are plenty of vendors who will give you product without requiring you to do it.<br /><br />I see post on here everyday about folks who have FE&#039;ed and been scammed. There is just no sense to it.

				Made a few successful buys on SR and got careless with the FE thing this one time. Page looks straight forward enough though. Still no defense for buyer finalizing early. Have looked around the forums since and discovered I might have to write this one off and go back to the vendors that have already proven consistent. <br /><br />Maybe just being paranoid,was shipped 7 days ago so there be another few days maybe before it&#039;s properly due.&nbsp;

				any good reputable vendor should not require you to FE it clearly states against it in the guides, stick to what you know man i hope it wasnt much if it doesnt pull thru but never FE for any reason
