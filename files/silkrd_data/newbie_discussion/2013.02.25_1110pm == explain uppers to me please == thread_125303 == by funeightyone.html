				I&#039;d like to get everyone&#039;s perspective on the difference between uppers (meth, speed, prescription, etc.)<br /><br />The biggest part of this question/discussion is this: what the hell is the &quot;polish speed paste&quot; that I see on SR and how is it different from meth (if it is different)?<br /><br />I just recently tried ICE because I really needed to stay away and I couldn&#039;t find an adderal. Although I&#039;ve always put it in the list of &quot;bad drugs&quot; in my head (because there are tonz of people in my area who have no teeth and generally look strung out and stupid), I actually found it to be useful. It kept me wide awake without making me feel like shit. no hangover, no comedown. Just some good productivity and loss of appetite. <br /><br />What i&#039;m wondering is: what is the best upper in your opion. Give me all the advise about things to watch out for etc. I like any drug that does what I need it to do for me - but I don&#039;t want to &quot;fall off&quot; on anything just because I didn&#039;t consider all the side effects or whatever. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not entirely sure about this but from my experience with Meth and Adderal, your speed paste is gonna be similar to Adderal. Adderal is pure Amphetamine which is&nbsp; what Speed is.<br /><br />So if you&#039;ve spent some time crushing up Adderal XR and snorting it..... that is probably to what you can expect.<br /><br />As for uppers, I would rate Cocaine is the absolute worst!<br />Its great for a Bell-Ringer but the half-life is a JOKE!<br /><br />Adderal XR is very cheap and one capsule will get most people pretty up without the SPUN effect of Crystal Meth.<br />There have been some extremely terrifying things happeining with that Mephadrone stuff.... aka bath salts.<br />A man actually attacked and ate another man&#039;s face off while high on that stuff.<br />It was all over the news and i bet you can simply google it.<br />I&#039;d avoid that like the plague seeing as there is no Scientific data to say what this crap does to humans 20 years later.

				The polish speed paste is based on a myth.&nbsp; Somehow it became popular opinion in Europe that the &quot;pure&quot; stuff is a paste.&nbsp; This is a lie, pure amphetamine sulfate is an odorless white or off-white powder.&nbsp; But since the contrary became popular belief, in Europe all the dealers sell their speed loaded down with solvents and liquids and random shit that smells like chemicals as &quot;pure speed paste.&quot;<br /><br />The absolute max purity for speed paste you&#039;re going to get is about 30%.&nbsp; That&#039;s because about half of it is adulterants, so obviously that 50% by weight isn&#039;t the speed you&#039;re supposedly buying: it&#039;s rubbish that can be extremely unhealthy.&nbsp; Avoid it if there&#039;s anybody selling something better at the time of purchase.&nbsp; BoyMaster and CapeCrusader have very popular products.&nbsp; CapeCrusader doesn&#039;t manufacture in bulk, so he sells out fast.&nbsp; He&#039;s currently sold out.<br />

				Yeah, um... mephedrone is a cat (cathinone).&nbsp; It&#039;s 4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC).&nbsp; Cats are very similar to amphetamines structurally and are also strong uppers, but they have less popular effects.&nbsp; They don&#039;t really lend themselves well to focusing on a task.&nbsp; Too scattered of a stim for that, at least that&#039;s what they feel like for me.<br /><br />You will not be eating anybody&#039;s face off after taking it.&nbsp; You really have to ignore most of what the media says about drugs.&nbsp; Mephedrone and MDPV (also a cat) are not nearly as bad as they say.&nbsp; Although I hear there&#039;s truth to the severely bad side effects if you binge on MDPV.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never wanted to, myself, so I wouldn&#039;t know.<br />

				anyone have a lot of experience with the difference in effects/side effects/general preferences between Amphetamine and Methamphetamine?<br /><br />I&#039;ve only taken the meth variety and in very small (compared to habitual users) doses. I think it&#039;s great for staying awake and being motivated and stuff. But I&#039;m very worried about meth mouth and ache and just looking like a crack whore. I&#039;m pretty sure I can handle NOT letting myself get addicted

One DOES NEED to know that what they are doing to themselves is almost playing Russian ruelette. There been no conclusive studies on the side effects on many of the most popular RCs out there right now. When you order RCs they are going to tell you &quot;not for human consumption&quot; and therefore they CANNOT send you a recommended started dose. What if you get hold of something of Fent-like strength?<br />Many of the current popular Synth Canabinoids contain a Naphthalene ring for example. It is will give less pure compounds a Mothball odor. It is a suspected human carcinogen. &lt;clearnet&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphthalene&lt;/clearnet&gt;<br /><br />I agree with not spreading misinformation. However the spread of need for concern remains valid.

				I like when they said &#039;I like any drug that does what I need it to do for me&#039; One thing I have learned for any drug, never expect it to do what it is suppose to. Unless you have done it enough to know. even then, it can be a crap shoot.

I mean, given that you can be certain of the purity of your drugs (which I am ALWAYS extremely careful about checking), you can expect similar results with similar dosage. i&#039;ve taken Shrooms, weed (also hash and honey oil and other concentrates - both eaten and smoked... and vaped), various pain pills, heroin (only snorted), coke, meth, adderall, mdma, mda, booze, and xanax. The only one that wasn&#039;t consistent was mdma and that&#039;s just because of the tolerance (which is still consistent in a way - consistently less effective). <br /><br />If you are a cautious drug user (like me) you protect your body and mind by being sure of what you are taking and how you&#039;re mixing it with other things. It&#039;s drug users who haphazardly pound random drugs in random dosages and random combinations that give drug users a bad name. If people were more careful there would be far fewer &quot;sad&quot; drug stories. And more drugs would probably still be legal. ;-) <br /><br />Think about it, it&#039;s like with all these RC&#039;s, they almost always stay legal until a couple people die from taking them.
