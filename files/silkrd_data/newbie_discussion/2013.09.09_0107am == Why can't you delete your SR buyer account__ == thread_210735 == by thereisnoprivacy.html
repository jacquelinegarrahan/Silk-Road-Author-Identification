				It seems like this would be a really key component to SR privacy/security. I found an old support thread where it was asked and the answer was that it was to &quot;prevent scamming&quot; (with no elaboration). The replies to that answer indicated that this didn&#039;t make any sense and I concur. <br /><br />Lots of other anonymity/bitcoin sites (I&#039;ll avoid naming names for my own privacy) allow you to delete your accounts and at least claim that they keep no logs. That makes me feel waaay better. I hope that SR is online forever with no drama, but I suspect (and it&#039;s only rational to consider) that SR will eventually be sezied and may even already be under Big Brother&#039;s control (they could use DPR and/or his account like they used the hacker Sabu, to get info on everyone else after they pounce on him). <br /><br />So shouldn&#039;t we be concerned that there are these records of all our transactions that are arbitrarily kept on file regardless of our preferences and security concerns?
