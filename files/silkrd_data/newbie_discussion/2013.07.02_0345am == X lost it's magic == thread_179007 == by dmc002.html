				I haven&#039;t rolled since 2002. Not that I haven&#039;t eaten X since then. I&#039;m afraid I can no longer roll. When I was young and dumb I ate a lot more X than I should have over a couple of months span. So much so that I stopped being able to roll. I thought that a break would set me right but no matter how long I waited in between attempts the best I could get would be a body buzz, and some feelings of empathy. I could never achieve a full blown roll. Eventually I gave up and stopped eating X altogether. However, since I&#039;ve been browsing the road I have repeatedly been tempted by some of the listings. So I was wondering if anybody else has experienced this and if there is anything that can be done about it.

				wow I have a very similar story!<br />I did tones of x in high school, and eventually stopped because the the magic was lost (6 years ago). I stopped doing it altogether up until a couple years ago for an annual music festival. The first time I did it after 6 years I felt exactly how you did, and never achieved a full blown roll. I thought all hope was lost, but then I remembered about 5-HTP. If you don&#039;t know what it is, look it up online. The body uses 5-HTP to make serotonin. I followed the directions on the bottle for 1-2 weeks before the annual festival, and took ~200mg of MDMA. I rolled just like the good old days.<br /><br />So my advice to you is look up 5-HTP and follow the directions and perhaps it can help you. I only roll once a year now, with the festival just a week and a half away i&#039;ve been taking 5-HTP. Can&#039;t wait&nbsp; :D

				Awesome! Thanks. I had heard about it back in my rave days but it&#039;s been a while and I don&#039;t remember much about it. If I&#039;m correct you can get it from places like GNC or Vitamin World right? Is it an MAOI? Sorry I&#039;m lazy, I&#039;ll google it later. Sounds promising though. Thanks again.<br /><br />edit: I just looked it up and answered my own question it says not to combine with an MAOI because of potential risk of serotonin syndrome.

				yes GMC would have it. You can probably get it cheaper at walmart though. <br />and yea as you found out MAOI and things that mess with serotonin are bad news. If i can recall correctly being on an MAOI and taking MDMA in itself is dangerous.<br />

				Yes 5-HTP is so great! I was introduced to it when in the States last year. We were at a festival and ate 5-HTP pills before we got into bed each night/morning. It definitely helps rebuild your serotonin levels so you can roll again and again&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;ve been noticing this as well...not even breaks do the trick anymore. I&#039;d been hearing about 5-HTP but I&#039;ll def give it a try now.
