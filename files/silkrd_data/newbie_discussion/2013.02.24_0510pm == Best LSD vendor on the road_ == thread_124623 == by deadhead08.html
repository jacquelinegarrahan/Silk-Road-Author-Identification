				Hey silkroad forums,<br /><br />I am looking for the best vendor for lsd, this does not mean the cheapest prices, although the prices of lsd are extremely expensive and it saddens me :(<br /><br />Please share with me your favorite or best lsd vendors!

				Truth, stock is always an issue. The good stuff goes fast. Keep an eye out of the forums, the vendors usually give a heads up when they will post

I&#039;m sure they are the goods. I mean find me a JoR tab at around 150-200ug and you&#039;ll probably have what 3Jane puts out.<br /><br />Still scary to take a chance on LSD here....I&#039;ve seen too many guys blow thousands and cannot recreate one hit they took at a dead show years ago....hmmm<br /><br />Now the shrooms (Cyclone, Catfish916, etc) are as good as shrooms can be and they usually take care of you when you order in bulk, unlike most lsd vendors...<br /><br />Just a thought...

				I wish the lsd vendors had the same mentality as the shroom vendors, like you say they do. but at the end of the day everyone&#039;s just trying to make money sadly. I would think lsd is one of the few things vendors would want to get to the masses, affordably.<br />/ramblings
