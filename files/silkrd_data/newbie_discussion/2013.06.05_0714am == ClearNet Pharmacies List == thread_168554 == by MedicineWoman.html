				I&#039;ve personally had great results from 2 CLEARNET pharmacy sites:<br /><br />* For asthma/allergy meds, etc.:<br />http://www.4cornerspharmacy.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- ClearNet link. Do not visit with TorBrowser -&gt;<br />Free shipping; usually receive orders to the US within 5 business days.<br /><br />* For Valium, Ambien, etc.:<br />http://www.24rx7.eu/&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;-- ClearNet link. Do not visit with TorBrowser -&gt;<br /><br />UPDATE: June 6, 2013<br />Turns out 24rx7 only works with&nbsp; pre-existing customers.<br />I tried to make a new account and they wrote:<br />&quot;Thank you for contacting us. This is a closed site for pre-existing<br />customers only.&quot;<br /><br />Can others vouch for good online purveyors of prescription meds?<br /><br />AND REMEMBER EVERYBODY, don&#039;t visit non-onion links using TorBrowser. Use your favorite normal browser, -- FireFox, Safari, MSIE, etc.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MW

				http://www.reliablerxpharmacy.com<br /><br />http://www.alldaychemist.com<br /><br />Both located in India but sell legit pharm grade meds.<br /><br />They sell very cheap erectile medication, tamoxifen, clomid, cabergoline, prami, exemestane, arimidex, and even HCG(reliablepharmacy) for all my steroid users :)<br /><br />Word of advice.&nbsp; Get a prepaid debit card like Vanilla Visa card and put on only how much you are going to order and use that card.&nbsp; While they are legit, I have heard stories of them charging other stuff on your card.

				Thanks. But legit sites shouldn&#039;t rip you off! I wouldn&#039;t recommend such a site.<br /><br />The 2 pharma&#039;s I listed are 100% legit, 5/5, and have never scammed my credit card. Looking for similar sites.

				lol hence why I gave the word of advice.&nbsp; <br /><br />For juicers, those sites come in very handy.<br /><br />By the way the 24/7rx site, how do you get into the main site..?

				Regarding setting up an account here:<br /><br />http://www.24rx7.eu<br /><br />On the right hand side where it says &quot;Have questions&quot;, fill out the form. They&#039;ll send you a login. Be patient, they take some time to set up new accounts.<br /><br />Also note: their prices are higher than on the Road. Ony advantage is you don&#039;t have to go through understanding Tor, bitcoins, PGP, etc.!<br /><br />

So I contacted support to see if they could reship. They reshipped all my drugs at no cost except for shipping again, which I thought was more than fair. An acquaintance of mine used them every other month or so for almost 2 years without issue.<br /><br />Also, when I finally got the box, it smelled like nag champa, which I got a kick out of.

				http://www.docsimon.co.uk/<br /><br />It&#039;s based somewhere in Eastern Europe, about 3 days shipping to western. I&#039;ve ordered Piracetam from them which was a solid purchase, though I&#039;m not sure how prices stack up. Also has has weight loss stuff like orlistat, but no ephedrine.<br /><br />They do prescription drugs if you tick the &#039;I am a doctor&#039; button and has things like Xanax (though I&#039;ve never ordered so don&#039;t know if extra proof is required, I doubt it). Most of the stuff has no recreational use so you have to sift through it (but I am sorted for my old age!). <br /><br />

				No problem. There&#039;s also the site https://safeorscam.com/ - you punch in the url of the pharmacy and it should give you an answer, but docsimon or the first two in this thread aren&#039;t recognised, so it&#039;s not obviously not conclusive.<br /><br />Might be worthwhile posting ones you know are scams too, just so no else makes a mistake they don&#039;t need to.

They were, by all appearances, very professional. But a Visa prepaid still isn&#039;t a bad idea.

				Bad idea to list them here.&nbsp; I posted a clearnet site that sold drugs on here and they had their hosting and domain pulled by GoDaddy within two weeks for violation of terms.&nbsp; They have since moved to a new domain.
