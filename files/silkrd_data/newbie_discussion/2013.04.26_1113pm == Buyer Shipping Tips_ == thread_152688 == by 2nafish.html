				I am a n00b (obviously) and I am considering making my first SR purchase but I have a few questions regarding shipping. There seems to be alot of tips for sellers but less info for buyers. I have searched this forum but I am having trouble finding the answers I am looking for so plz bare with me. <br /><br />I am under the impression (plz correct me if im wrong) that ideally you would want your goods shipped to an address that may be some sort of &quot;safe house&quot; meaning that the address does not have any illegal things and if possible is not even linked to the purchaser directly. Unfortunately I do not have such a luxury, my only option would be to have it shipped to me or where I work. I dont have any friends that would be down to be the receiver for these packages nor would their houses be free of illegal items. The other aspect of this situation is that I live in a small community in that only has po boxes. There is no mail man that delivers mail, to receive mail I have to go to the post office and open my po box. The same goes for my work, we have a po box that is collected by the receptionist everyday at lunch although it is a much larger box that can receive large packages. Now on to my questions...<br /><br />1. Is it stupid to have a delivery sent to a po boxes (personal or work)? I would prefer personal so work is not involved but at the same time maybe work would be safer because I dont have to go to the post office to get my package.<br /><br />2. Is it stupid to use my real name? <br />I think my only option is to use my real name. If I dont use my real name at work I will not receive the package from the receptionist. If I dont use my real name for my personal po box that will raise a red flag because my name is linked to that po box no one else. <br /><br />3. Because I am shipping to a po box and not my home would that be a benefit to me in the event that package is intercepted by LE in regards to warrants? If the package to be delivered does not have my physical address can LE issue a warrant for my home? I dont know where I could store my illegal items until the coast was clear...<br /><br />I am only going to be buying small quantities for personal use if that helps determine the answers and none of the goods I want to purchase is weed so odor should be less of an issue I hope (mostly just pills and powder).<br /><br />Any insight would be much appreciated!&nbsp; :)

				The way I see it, your security all comes down to the stealth the vendor uses, if something goes wrong and a controlled delivery happens at a home address the best thing you can do is deny expecting a package and NOT sign for it. Anybody can send you anything at anytime - it&#039;s not damning refusing to accept a package, just know that receiving anything else there would be under much higher scrutiny (also, veterans here recommend &#039;cleaning house&#039; to CYA).<br /><br />Remember, many many packages flow through the system daily, the only way one is suspicious is if it gets detected - I&#039;ve seen some ridiculously sketchy packaging from eBay sellers. Sellers here are lightyears more sophisticated. lol<br /><br />Having a PO Box is in your name is a bad idea, supposedly it&#039;s better just to have the packages &#039;blend&#039; in with your typical home mail in general. If it&#039;s a PO Box of your employer, if an issue arises you would possibly risk your job too.<br /><br />From what I see you want it addressed as normally as possible to avoid suspicion, so real name &amp; address. Like I said before, there are thousands and thousands of other packages processed daily. If there&#039;s no reason to suspect a SR package it will be delivered as you would expect a pair of kicks to be off shoes.com.

				Thanks for the info. So your saying sending to my own po box and using my real name the best option. That makes the most sense to me also. I would imagine that for small quantities that a safe house is probably not as big of an issue. I know I am not on any LE radar so I dont think I need to be too paranoid, though paranoia does keep you safe...<br /><br />If anyone else has any suggestions/ tips in regards to this topic I would like to hear em.<br /><br />Thanks

				My understanding is you should never ship to a P.O. Box because they can be opened by LE or other people.&nbsp; The best method is a house other than your own (trusted friend) that you ship it to using a real name.&nbsp; This removes the connection from the buyer and where it ends up.

				Personal Shipping?<br /><br />Um... I think half of SR genuinely use their REAL address, due to the risk of mail fraud and costs of running elaborate screens... If you are buying for personal use, then be prepared to do the following: <br /><br />1) Deny any/all packages that are hand delivered<br />2) Destroy the packaging immediately<br />3) Secure the contents from search &amp; seizure--i.e. hidden very, very well; odor control; etc.<br />4) Remain polite and cordial to any/all authority figures--and SILENT if necessary... until you can determine if a lawyer is necessary<br />5) DO NOT IMMEDIATELY REFER TO A LAWYER, OR THE NEED THEREOF until the handcuffs are placed on your wrists; ONLY AT THIS MOMENT DO YOU NEED TO CONSIDER HIGHERING (OR CALLING) A LAWYER. Otherwise, it raises unnecessary and repeat attention.<br /><br />Good Luck...<br /><br />Also remember that several states have legalized medical marijuana, and others have outright decriminalized or legalized marijuana. If federal agents are storming into your home, then don&#039;t resist and fight back with legal power--NOT VIOLENCE OR HOSTILITY. Don&#039;t make the case against yourself for being aggressive and a &quot;danger to society&quot;, which PROSECUTORS WILL CLAIM....

				@vem<br />Unfortunately I dont really have the option of not using a po box. All usps mail in this region is delivered to po boxes. I would imagine that po boxes are protected by federal law just like your home mail boxes are. I think that LE would need a warrant to open your package regardless of a po box or physical address. Ideally yes I would get someone who leaves a legit life and has a clean house to receive my packages but I dont know of anyone like that... so here i am.<br /><br />@PerPETualMOtion<br />Thanks for the tips. Good info.<br /><br />I think the next step would probably just ask the vendor. Certainly they would be able to tell me if the po box delivery is stupid. If i get any new info i will post it here. If anyone else has anything to add plz do.<br /><br />Thanks

				PO box and real name are fine. <br />Some people have the luxury of being able to use a drop address, but not everyone can.<br /><br />You have to accept that ordering drugs online does carry some risk, however small.&nbsp; <br />But in all honesty, if the vendor has decent packaging methods then you&#039;ll be fine.<br />It also depends on what you&#039;re ordering to some degree. A few grams of powder, handful of pills, half ounce of weed, etc.. no problems.<br />If you plan on ordering large amounts, like re-sell amounts, then I&#039;d have a rethink on delivery.

				I get nervous about the personal address thing too. My apartment complex front office receives packages and places them in the back closet until the resident can pick them up. I know it&#039;s just an added pair of hands into the long chain of hands that already handles my package, but it still makes me nervous.

				I obviously can&#039;t share my strategy with you for security reasons.<br /><br />That said, the most important thing is that wherever you send it, make sure it&#039;s a valid address and that the person is known by USPS to receive mail at that address.<br /><br />A PO Box would make me very nervous. The same rules apply about opening mail, so that wouldn&#039;t worry me.<br /><br />At a physical address if things look suspicious, you can at least try throwing the package in the trash.<br /><br />If they a postal inspector catches you and it goes to a PO Box, you&#039;re getting arrested before you leave the post office.<br /><br />I used to have a PO Box many years ago and I&#039;d swear I had to show ID to get it. I could be wrong. Even if I am right, I guess there&#039;s always fake ID&#039;s.<br /><br />If others say it works for them, then I believe them.<br /><br />I will tell you one thing, ever since I started buying on the road, I started chucking those attempted delivery notices I get for certified letters and undelivered packages LOL. They&#039;re not getting me to walk in there when I have an open order.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just paranoia. I&#039;ve never had a package not arrive.<br /><br />EDIT: I mean show ID to establish the PO Box, not to pick up mail. You don&#039;t need to show ID to pick it up. Anyone with a key can do that. I would be terrified if I ordered something that didn&#039;t fit inside the box and I had to pick it up at the counter though. But again, I&#039;m super fucking paranoid.

				You dont have to show your id to pick up mail. At least not at my post office. I just go in and open my box with my key. I think in the event that the package was intercepted by LE they would do a controlled delivery. They would put a slip in my box notifing me that I had a package to be collected at the desk. This happens alot when the package is bigger then the po box (which is pretty small). Then I would go up present the slip and then they would ask for a signature and id say &quot;sorry no thank you bye&quot;. This is speculation of how i think it would have to go down. If they need you to sign at your door, they would need you to sign at the post office. The signature is the final step before getting busted right? I remember reading about a bust at my post office where someone had a few pounds of weed sent to thier po box and there was a controlled delivery. I dont know the details but from what i read in the paper it sounded like the dude got busted picking the package up at the counter. Another thing about the post office is that it closes at 5pm and I can access my box after hours as late as 10pm. Im sure the fuzz would have no issue working late to bust someone but I doubt they are going to stake out the post office waiting to see if i show up to get the package that contains a handful of pills. Again im talking small personal amounts not large quantities.

				Try to order things that fit in your post box. I&#039;ve had one of those boxes before and it&#039;s probably the best for ordering- all the discretion of a P.O. box with none of the security features.

Maybe my message was unclear. <br /><br />Like some of the guys above said, a PO Box in your name receiving only SR packages is a bad idea. A PO Box should only be used if you can acquire one using another alias, which is kinda sketchy on its own. In absence of an available &#039;drop-house&#039; using your home address should be ok, as long as your vendor&#039;s stealth is good and you follow the rules in the slim chance of a CD.

				If it&#039;s your regular P.O box there shouldn&#039;t be anything particularly suspicious about the package or envelope containing drugs versus those you normally receive. It isn&#039;t as if people working in mail office, particularly one at your work, are examining every piece of mail and considering the illicit goods it could contain.<br /><br />But yes, delivery to your P.O box is fine, the one at your work probably safer, or at least a less anxiety-inducing experience. <br /><br />If people were getting caught for using their real names with any regularity, we wouldn&#039;t see all the reviews and returning customers.

However, if you wanna be better protected, statistically, a higher package influx is better than single bogies.

Keep that in mind when you increase your packages, you are decreasing the amount of hot items in your snail shell.<br /><br />Hmmmmm.... let me think about this some more...

In Colorado and Washington where ALL possession of marijuana has recently been made legal under state law, the law regarding shipping drugs by USPS still applies (federal drug laws ALWAYS trump state laws)<br /><br />Anyone who gets busted for receiving drugs in the male is getting busted by the FEDS, not state authorities.

Otherwise, it raises unnecessary and repeat attention.&quot;<br /><br />In my opinion, that&#039;s terrible advice. Sure, you can deny ordering the package and you can claim not to know what it contains, but don&#039;t say ANYTHING else until you have a lawyer. The only other thing you should say is that you&#039;re uncomfortable being questioned by the police without a lawyer present. Or you can just say that you&#039;d prefer not to answer their questions. You are not legally required to answer them.<br /><br />If you are a suspect, and you are being questioned by the police, and the police have neither a warrant for your arrest nor probable cause to arrest you, then they don&#039;t have to give you a Miranda warning (aka read you your rights) to use your own words against you. Your words can either lead to you being placed under arrest and can be used against you at trial. Anything you&#039;ve said before you&#039;d become a suspect WILL be used against you in court (or used to obtain a search or arrest warrant).<br /><br />There is also exception in the law that permits them to search you WITHOUT a warrant if it is likely that you will destroy or conceal evidence (which would apply here).<br /><br />DO NOT EVER talk to the police when they are questioning you informally, and above all, DON&quot;T EVER let them into your house without a warrant! (many people are unaware that they CAN refuse entry to the police and end up getting arrested for items &quot;in plain sight&quot; -- and in plain sight has a broad definition).<br /><br />You have no idea how much the police know and why they are asking you the questions they are asking. Generally, they suspect you long before they start questioning you.<br /><br />I agree that, in the case of informal questioning, refusing to answer appears suspicious; but in this case, they probably already suspect you and are trying to get you to incriminate yourself (you have no idea what they know -- it&#039;s easier to do than people think). And keep in mind that you are actually guilty and do have something that you need to hide.<br /><br />Even if you answer their questions and aren&#039;t arrested, I guarantee that you will be under surveillance after that.<br /><br />If you are arrested and indicted, they still have to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. It&#039;s easier to do that using your own words.<br /><br />It seems counter-intuitive, but don&#039;t talk to the police ever. You can&#039;t talk yourself out of being arrested no matter how hard you try. And again, NEVER let them enter your home without a warrant.<br /><br />If the police were to knock on my door and I were to answer (I wouldn&#039;t, but for the sake of the hypothetical), I wouldn&#039;t open the screen door at all.

				Don&#039;t bother with the PO box, nor the fake name.<br />People can send you what ever they wanna send you, without anyone being able to prosecute you on the contend, unless you sign for it.<br /><br />If that was not the case, and someone wanted you to get in trouble. They could just mail a letter to you containing illegal drugs. And hope it got intercepted by customs.<br /><br />You are not responsible for what people send you in the mail.

It is one of the most dangerous tactics when dealing with LE. They are testing your train of thought, and trying to discover a lie. The moment you reveal incriminating information, then you are in for a shit storm of hostility. It is an interrogation technique: make false statements to confuse the suspect, to trick someone into misspeaking.<br /><br />1) People lie. If someone makes a statement about your particular situation, then you have a responsibility to deny it if it incriminates you.<br />2) Ask the police what&#039;s going on. You can safely test the waters by asking the police what the situation is. If you are innocent, then you are likely as curious as them to know what the story is. What is happening?<br /><br />They have to write reports, and if you&#039;re story is consistent and unchanging--and they don&#039;t have any evidence against you--then all they can do is harass you until they realize they are wasting their time.<br /><br />3) Waste their fucking time. Remain calm.<br />4) Remain polite, cordial. This is the most powerful tactic against LE. PsyWar, if you will. Guilty people have guilty consciences. <br /><br />You&#039;re not guilty? Remain calm. Remain sober (even if you&#039;re not!). Remain vigilent.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for all the insight everyone. Sorry for the delayed response, first time I was able to get on since the most recent ddos. Just to clarify, it seems that some of you may be under the impression that I was going to set up a po box exclusivley for SR receiving. That is not the case. I already have a PO box that i receive all my legit mail to, bills, birthday cards, etc... I live in an area that only has PO boxes for usps delivery. An sr package would just be another envelope in the mix of all the other legit mail i get. I have had the po box for 5 years and have never ever been busted by the cops for anything in my life, so I dont think i am on any LE radar. Thanks again for all the helpful info.

				I think I have a pretty good situation at my place.&nbsp; I buy and sell a lot of things online, so in a typical week I may receive 40 packages at my house.&nbsp; I know both USPS delivery guys, the UPS guys, the Fed ex guys, the DHL guy, the Ontrack guy... basically I can have packages addressed to Haywood Jablowme and the delivery people wouldn&#039;t even take a second glance. <br /><br />I would also know right away if someone that shouldn&#039;t be delivering tries to come deliver...<br /><br />In my opinion it&#039;s nice having a lot of packages coming in, but I probably wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to order things I don&#039;t need just to blend in.
