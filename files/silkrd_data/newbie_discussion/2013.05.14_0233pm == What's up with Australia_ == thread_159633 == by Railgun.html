I personally think a lot of the things said on here about Australia and the difficulty in product reaching its destination is nothing more than fear mongering and the spreading of uncertainty!<br /><br />I know for a fact that the majority of items make their way safely and unharmed but vendors do need to put a bit more effort in their shipping practices to make this happen though.<br /><br />Because Australia relies so heavily on it&#039;s agricultural industry and there&#039;s so many plants/animals in other parts of the world that would cause a great deal of harm if they made their way there. The quarantine measures are very strict.<br /><br />That&#039;s one reason.<br /><br />The other reason is that the Australian government seriously over-reaches when it comes to controlling it&#039;s people. They have laws for their laws and committees for their committees and it really is a nanny-state.<br /><br />That being said, it&#039;s one of the most beautiful countries and the people living there are tremendous!<br /><br />But by following the excellent advice in this thread - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0 the percentage of &quot;no-shows&quot; will be minuscule.<br /><br /><br />Laissez-faire!<br />

				We live in a nanny-state where our government likes to control our lives. Also our customs are tight as fuck, but I ordered some LSD which got here perfectly. Also ordering some Ketamine which should get here no problemo

				I&#039;d imagine Austrailia is one of the few places where re-selling SR cocaine could actually be profitable.&nbsp; If morons buy shitty blow at $350 then I bet some of this stuff could easily top that.

				Weed is massive here and it&#039;s everywhere. Close second would be MDMA with maybe GHB and Meth (well where I live at least).<br /><br />Other drugs are SUPER expensive down here and not even good quality.

				well not quite 800 hehe but still quite abit. <br />MDMA for example you could buy 1g for what $50 O/S ? sell it here for $20-30/100mg.. possibly even $50/100mg at a rave or where people are desperate. You could probably make $200-350/gram pretty easy.&nbsp; <br /><br />and shady people who cut it could double that the amount. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159633.msg1129852#msg1129852">Quote from: zetterberg99 on May 15, 2013, 10:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">800%&nbsp; holy fuck&nbsp; :o&nbsp; thats insane, but I guess it makes sense being on an island and all.<br /><br />Why not with weed though?&nbsp; Is there a big cannabis industry down under?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there could be some massive outdoor farms in some more remote places, but I would guess its not the optimal climate<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
