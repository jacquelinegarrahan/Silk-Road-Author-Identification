				I was thinking of capping 140 mg of MDMA with 20 mg of meth for a festival coming up. Would that be sufficient for a good time? I&#039;m around 200 lbs but have never tried meth, only rx adderall and vyvanse.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed some MDMA I&#039;ve tried leaves my legs feeling heavy during the come down even when I was sitting or lying down the whole time, that&#039;s why I thought meth would be sweet. But anybody who&#039;s experienced in capping their own shit is welcome to help me out.

				Not sure if that is the best combo. Could be a little bit too much if you take it simultaneously. I would advise to take the MDMA and when it starts to wear off, then hit the meth.

				MDMA = LSD is a pretty good combo. Very popular. Often called candyflipping.

				I like doing a bit of coke then a bit of mdma. But I have been told the coke spoils the mdma buzz on the forums here. Still I do like to do that.

				Thanks for the advice bros. I think I might go with just the MDMA and if I can find something good to do at night/afterwards, rail some meth.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to try candyflipping but I don&#039;t know if I could handle LSD or any psychadelic. I used to smoke mad weed but over time I started getting super paranoid and think weird shit that would make me so uncomfortable I would pray I could fall asleep. Sometimes I would look at an object and make up an entirely different reality for the person who I thought put that object together; awful stuff.

				Candy Flipping=Acid+Mdma<br /><br />Hippie Flipping= Shrooms+Mdma<br /><br />Both are very cool different experiences you won&#039;t forget. Stay away from anything else amphetamine class or opiate they seem to take away from the mdma experince.

				Speaking of candyflipping... would that only work with LSD, or is it also possible to mix with DOx and NBOMes? C;

				I&#039;d just stick with the MDMA by itself.<br /><br />IMO, combining it with something else is still fun, but you get diminished returns from both drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />For example, MDMA=Shrooms was fun, but the shroom trip wasn&#039;t as hard and the MDMA not as euphoric. Same with MDMA+amphetamine, less euphoria and lesser high.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />My favorite &quot;combo&quot; is a cap of MDMA and a blunt of good weed.&nbsp; 8)

				If you are going to candy flip. Take the LSD first, then an hour or so after you feel the effects pop your mdma. That way when the mdma kicks in it will be basically impossible to have a bad trip and when the LSD is wearing off you will still be slightly rolling on the MDMA. Making the come down a bit easier.

				Hands down its 2CB for the win. MDMA first and when the roll tapers snort 15 mg or take 25mg oral. Pure magic and the 2CB will alleviate the serotonin drop the next day. 8)&nbsp;

				Recreationally, as well as therapeutically, I&#039;d suggest 2-cb and MDMA to anyone reading this. It&#039;s a Shulgin favorite.<br />MDMA + 2c-e is also very interesting.

				I&#039;ve had a lot of pills cut with meth. The meth definitely overpowers the mdma, leaving me just feeling twacked out and disappointed. <br />Weed always makes me the body buzz of the mdma more, and it can be quite interesting to smoke after you start rollin to possibly help get over your paranoia from weed. I used to get REALLY paranoid as well, like 2 hits of good shit and I would be totally introverted, sweating, ridiculously tense, thinking totally abstract paranoid thoughts. The euphoria of the mdma might help calm those feelings and help remind you why you liked weed in the first place =) tho, of course, start small and work your way up.<br />One of the best times I have ever had was on 200mg of mdma (of unknown purity) and 5 hits of acid lol! Absolutely rediclous, I was way too out of my normal mode of thinking to remember or integrate any real &quot;spiritual&quot; principals from that trip, but it was total hedonistic blissful gonzo paradise. The acid makes the comedown of mdma much more mellow imho as well.<br />Have fun and be safe!<br />
