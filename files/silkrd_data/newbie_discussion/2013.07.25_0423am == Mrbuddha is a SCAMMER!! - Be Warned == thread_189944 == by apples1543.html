				I also was just one of the unfortunate ones to just be scammed by Mrbuddha.<br />Do not send him anything as he will just take the money, cancel the order and leave you with nothing.<br /><br />Please read about this vendor as I am not the only one. <br /><br />

				One of my buyers was scammed out of their moneypak also!! He was offering to exchange monyepaks for no fee - and cash to vendors for no fee. Anything that looks to good to be true - probably is!

I used MrBuddha twice for $300 &gt; MP BTC successfully in under 12 hours. My guess is he was building a rep to make a quick grab and go. If he burned say 20 people at once Im sure he skated with at least $5k USD. TERRIBLE.<br /><br />Other than using services like CampBx or Bitinstant how else does everyone get their coins?

				It&#039;s got nothing to do with the &quot;free exchange&quot;. He had 15 PAGES OF &quot;5 OF 5&quot; RATINGS, I&#039;m sorry but no one could have seen that he was a scammer. He comes back after 2 days of being gone and he says he is way behind in orders so he is looking to make quick deals, anyone would have believed him. I lost money on him too, but after doing some research on what happened there seems to be a couple of other very reputable dealers that all went rogue this week. <br /><br />My theory: They are all the same guy.... I laugh at the estimates I see (~5K). Before he closed his vendor page the day that he turned scammer (7/22/13) there were multiple reviews saying that he had not come through on their orders of greater than $5000 in MPs or BTCs (there was one of $10200). THIS GUY WAS DOING THAT ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS. Not including all the people who have not come forward, this guy walked away with &gt; $60000, I guarantee it. I really think that is a conservative estimate too. <br /><br />It was one hell of a scam on his end. It took 6 months of work to build a reputation and then the big orders starting coming in.... then he sends out the story about his family emergency we all received and he was never to be seen again.

				I used to use Sugar Mama when she was around to exchange my MP for bit coins. She was upfront and above board, but the fees charged and there at the end having to wait 3-4 days made it just as easy to use bitinstant until they went tits up. Seeing the ease in which vendors can scam with this, I don&#039;t think I will ever go back to getting my coins via a vendor. <br /><br />There are safer alternatives out there, imo.

				yeah mrbuddha got me too....and his vendor page was pretty solid thats what sucks and he had hero members on the forums backing him so its kind of hard to spot the scam in that but oh well, but i agree with the estimate i know he made out with over 60K ....i personally know of 30K he has taken from and i know i dont know everyone that he has affected so i am sure the money is an insane amount but yeah dude is a prick....i have used JMB and BTCking multiple times with no problems whatsoever if you need to use the road for coins...if not check out CampBx and localbitcoins......and ironically enough like another poster said i have had really really bad luck with MPs too probably out of 10 Mp trans i have done 4 of them i got scammed on....i know my fault obviously but weirdly enough the 15 Reloadits i have done all 15 successful really weird now that i think about it.....also some info passed to me that MPs are watching account taking things from one zipcode and uploaded elsewhere and locking account on it....check out JumboMonkeyBiscuit....he actually explains the problems with MPs now and im inclined now to never use MP again just knowing that little extra info, and i trust JMB never a problem EVER!
