				hey everyone<br /><br />last tuesday, i placed my first orders on silk road; cheap orders from 4 different vendors. one arrived on friday, but the other 3 seem to be waiting somewhere over the weekend ... which makes me nervous. could they be stored somewhere at customs and they do random checks?<br /><br />rubiksdude

				are they domestic orders or international?<br />most of my domestic uk orders arrive within 2-3 days of ordering, order by a tuesday to be almost guaranteed weekend consumption. I have not yet ordered internationally, not worth the extra hassle when there is a good domestic market for what I want.<br />

				Should not be a problem, but if it don&#039;t show for a low time you may clean out your apartment of the other things you got. And i mean a couple of weeks. Think it this way, even if the postman&#039;s stand still and don&#039;t deliver your post on weekend. But international orders NEVER stop coming in its a 24 hours work all day in the week. this means that even if your package laying somewhere they still need to check all the posts that come in on Saturday Sunday and so on. Even if its laying there they don&#039;t got time to &quot;extra&quot; check all the posts. Don&#039;t worry.

				Don&#039;t worry it hasn&#039;t been that long. They will show as long as the vendors you ordered from are legit.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. There&#039;s a weekend every week, nothing special about this one. Postal employees have better things to do than snoop thru your mail.

				Im sure your orders will arrive this is merely a case of *First time SR user syndrome* but i would caution you about the fact that you sent 4 new packages to your addy within such a short period of time. Be careful; less packages=less % chance something bad will go wrong.
