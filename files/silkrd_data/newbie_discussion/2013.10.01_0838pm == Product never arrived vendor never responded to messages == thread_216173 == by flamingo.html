				I made a $200 order with a vendor who has great feedback. I have used him before and everything was perfect. This time, product never arrived and despite my leaving numerous messages over a 2 week period he/she has yet to answer any. I finalised as I was afraid it would effect my rating but feel a bit let down. <br />should they have answered me and was it right to finalise although i never received the product?

				it was domestic, his product usually arrives in a few days. i asked for an extention but SR still wrote &#039;finalise in x days&#039; so i just did it in order not to get a bad rating. i&#039;ll give him another week to respond to my messages before &#039;naming&#039; his handle on this site. feel kinda bummed.

				his page says that he is behind on his messages and if its important to put the order number in the subject. which i did. not a peep from him. so i guess i have no choice but to write it off. whats worse is that i set up a post box and now must abandon it.
