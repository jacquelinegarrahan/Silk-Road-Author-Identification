				I reagent tested Symbiosis&#039; S+ ket about a month ago, positive for ketamine from mandelin reagent, negative for anything else detected for by mandelin, mecke, simons, and marquis reagent tests.&nbsp; If you have an ounce, why not cook it and see the yield

				It is not ketamine. Just got mine this morning, took my usual k dose and it turned me into a vegetable. It must be mixed with MXE or some other knock off. Very sickening. Have contacted Sym and will let you know how it goes
